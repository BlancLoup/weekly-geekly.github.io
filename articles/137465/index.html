  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Roverbook Discovery AT4 - "compact" laptop from the 90s</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Having recently read a post about a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/atnikvariat/136724/">color electronic notebook of Casio CSF-5750</a> recently, I remembered that I have been collecting a book from a citizen under my bed for many years and wondered if I could write a review about it.  Today I decided that the day had come, crawled under the bed, but I saw this handsome man about whom I had forgotten a long time and understood that it was his time.  So, meet: Roverbook Discovery AT4. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d81/306/e87/d81306e877d20bbcdef2137f39cba331.jpg"><br>  Traffic! (30 photos) <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Specifications: </h4><br>  This is not an old school 486dx, of course, but it evokes respect all the same, with the very same characteristics being the first computer I had at home. <br><ul><li>  Screen: 12.1 "TFT 800x600 (dull!) </li><li>  CPU: Pentium 166MHz with mmx </li><li>  RAM: 16Mb </li><li>  HDD: Seagate st92255A G 2250Mb </li><li>  Cd-rom and fdd: Present </li><li>  Battery: Li-Ion 10.8V 3900mAh (for many years as dead) </li></ul><br>  The same directly from the screen: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d17/8f7/1e1/d178f71e1d15de48ba63e85a1e5688e7.jpg"><br><br>  Year of manufacture did not work out, Yandex when trying to google this model gives out under this name a completely different laptop, more modern.  I think somewhere 97-98.  He came to me already being an old man in 2005.  I think at the time of his release to have it was the ultimate dream of many, even despite the fact that it is a rover.  Although the lack of usb in it somehow embarrassed me, all the desktop pc that I saw from the pentium 90 had usb on board, and here already a whole mmx, but there is no usb.

    <h4>  Appearance: </h4><br>  In the closed state, it is a fairly weighty briefcase, holding in your hands you understand that if you give it to the head, then for the head the damage to which will be more fatal than for him.  Given what time in the 90s in Russia there was a time, then maybe this is such a feature from a rover. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a07/c19/e0a/a07c19e0a3f81d89c3259c4911d708a5.jpg"><br><br>  The keyboard is quite normal for laptops, fn as seen from the left, except that the keyboard latches on the top are interesting. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cb7/8a4/245/cb78a42456aba1bd840cacc416cb6030.jpg"><br><br>  It is necessary to move them and with a slight movement of the hand the keyboard is removed ... I do not know why they did it this way, maybe because it was easier, this tricky idea might be that if you spill something on the keyboard, it is immediately pulled out and liquid is drained from it. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a8b/ffc/7a5/a8bffc7a5c777035b92cc024859f2316.jpg"><br><br>  Above the keyboard there is a screen showing the battery level, caps / num lock, access to hdd / fdd-cd-rom, etc.  I understand that the usual LEDs that have become usual have replaced the small screens.  I definitely like the screen more than diodes, it does not blink with acid blue-green bright light at night. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5a6/ce6/e40/5a6ce6e4014350a7c6604c7d163a5652.jpg"><br><br>  There is fdd on the front face, not about any card readers then there was no talk. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/551/f7e/5ab/551f7e5abfb29fcc770058706688a020.jpg"><br><br>  On the left side are: Kensington lock, video output, as many as two PCMCIA slots, which eventually disappeared from laptops, and from many mainboards - ps / 2, and as many as three audio sockets. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f8e/42a/feb/f8e42afebe13013597de27849c8840f8.jpg"><br><br>  On the right side of it: the battery compartment cover and the 8-speed cd-rom which I flatly refused to read cd-rw discs. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e1d/ff5/f70/e1dff5f706872469b6ab3d7ef92f75a4.jpg"><br><br>  The battery of the Taiwanese assembly at 3900mAh, by the time the laptop came into my hands was already dead, held for 10 minutes. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f02/a15/4b7/f02a154b7621a8b7b8e089a75028760d.jpg"><br><br>  From the rear, a professional upgrade with blue electrical tape, which protects the back cover from accidental opening much more reliably than the native latch, is extremely lousy.  In addition to the tape, we see the socket for charging, above it is an infrared port, then a cover that is sealed with tape and covers the port, and a compartment as I picked up to connect the dock.  station. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f18/c84/3a8/f18c843a80c882740a9759d459953cd5.jpg"><br><br>  Open the lid and see the ports, usb as I said, unfortunately there are no. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2a4/1c0/7ea/2a41c07eaa0b94c35e51da1694faedea.jpg"><br><br>  From below, we see a rover sticker with a proud inscription "Made in Russia" (I wonder why it was "made" and not "assembled", and whether it was assembled), and the compartments for access to the entrails. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5d0/2f4/6d9/5d02f46d91f028c438957b5f5daa2689.jpg"><br><br>  The hdd basket is pulled out after the latch has been moved, there are no retaining bolts.  Perhaps another amendment to the 90s, to dismiss the laptop did not work out - he unfastened valuable information and ran like a Forest Gump. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d5c/bf8/123/d5cbf8123e5dd4f5b325d19b110388e9.jpg"><br><br>  Himself hard - Seagate st92255A G already on solid 2GB and 250MB above.  Native or not I do not know. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c4d/8fb/e17/c4d8fbe1787769dbc48073aec8c2d280.jpg"><br><br>  We remove one of the covers on the bottom and see something that looks like a memory compartment installed 16 megabytes I don‚Äôt watch, it seems either hidden deeply or soldered. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/85b/b54/a0d/85bb54a0d9fc76560b5fe3cc68d0fb9a.jpg"><br><br>  For the next cover there is some unknown nest and an empty place to place some module there. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/791/6e9/34e/7916e934e45593eed45f89d489f254e3.jpg"><br><br>  The third cover on the bottom is removed simply by hand, and hides the battery and two installed chips behind it, perhaps video memory. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/100/4b5/b73/1004b5b73db06f7b8f02fb643ea6353f.jpg"><br><br><h4>  The key to start </h4><br><br>  Connect the power supply, turn on, and see: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9e4/aed/dea/9e4aeddea02d759f0b1ab42a079f664d.jpg"><br><br>  How many nerves have you eaten ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/91e/9cc/f93/91e9ccf9398b11188ca54ccec1ac7421.jpg"><br><br>  This laptop has a bug with win98.  It is necessary to turn off the laptop correctly through the "start-&gt; shutdown" and the next time it does not load, will hang or fly into the blue screen.  And if you simply turn off any problems through the button, the skandisk will grumble about incorrect shutdown, check the disk and everything will work fine. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/288/df7/63f/288df763f0acde2a24a904509c68b4be.jpg"><br><br>  Then just a few photos for fans of ponastalgize: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3af/373/441/3af373441de0530cbb516c08bbcbc292.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/031/89d/41b/03189d41ba9a547ee4e5c5def7f732bc.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1b6/f06/cab/1b6f06cab1ac891cef0959f544ec5acc.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eba/540/816/eba540816a969c97b997fac77fa27198.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4c9/917/3a5/4c99173a5f63ce55782ff2b244c668cc.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/017/9e9/bc7/0179e9bc7a067fa338b6850a8a2b0f47.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Well, in conclusion ... </h4><br>  When this laptop was probably considered mega thin / light / compact, and cost no less than a car.  Now I put my budget 13 "Samsung on i3 alongside which is far from ultrabooks in terms of compactness. <br><br><img src="http://rghost.ru/36250964/image.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://rghost.ru/36250984/image.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://rghost.ru/36251018/image.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The obvious conclusion: progress is a cool thing! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137465/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137465/</a></p>
