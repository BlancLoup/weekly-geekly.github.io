Despite the fact that in some countries ICO is prohibited (China, South Korea), various companies continue to raise funds for the implementation of projects with the help of ICO.  Someone is worse, someone is better.  Below are examples of the most successful ICOs.  The main factor here is the amount collected, because it is about raising funds, and not about the success of the project itself.  It happened that despite the large amount of investment received, the project burned through.  But this is a topic for another article. <br><br>  By the way, the very first ICO was held in 2013 (it was conducted by Mastercoin, $ 5 million was raised), that is, the initial placement of tokens by companies that need investments is not a novelty at all.  Yes, a lot of talk about ICO began in 2016-2017, but they began to be held for a long time. <a name="habracut"></a>

      I must say that earlier ICO collected a maximum of 10-20 million US dollars.  Now, in some cases, the account is already about hundreds of millions.  We will talk about such large-scale ICOs in the current article. <br><br><h3>  EOS: $ 185 million </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b6c/92b/9bd/b6c92b9bd12071544d621cdb2e0037a9.png"><br><br>  The block.one company, registered on the long ago offshore Cayman Islands, was able to raise about $ 185 million in July 2017.  Fundraising was for the implementation of the EOS project.  The goal of the project is the automation of business processes in the financial sphere, the development of applications and services for evaluating the volume of transactions and other things necessary for the business.  Goals are realized thanks to a new blockchain-architecture designed for vertical and horizontal scaling of decentralized applications. <br><br>  In turn, such a scheme is <a href="">achieved</a> by creating a structure in the form of an operating system, on the basis of which applications can be built.  Users get accounts, authentication, databases.  Asynchronous communication and all the other delights of decentralized architecture.  The new blockchain architecture can scale to millions of transactions per second, and there are no user fees, but there is a possibility of quick and easy deployment of decentralized applications. <br><br>  The head of block.one <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eos-blockchain-idUSKBN19D2T6">said</a> that the main task of EOS is to create a solid foundation for business applications in the blockchain ecosystem. <br><br><h3>  Status: $ 108 million </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/745/1d5/86d/7451d586d628a3003353afdeb769623d.jpg"><br><br>  This ICO was conducted by an organization that developed a decentralized application of the same name, which is an analogue of Telegram (with certain assumptions, this is exactly the case), the basis of which is Ethereum.  This platform has no single operator, messages are processed by the blockchain network itself when sent.  The positive side is that the registration does not require a phone number, only a cryptographic key generated by the system is required.  The instant messenger has a built-in browser, a specific currency exchange, plus an application for entering into smart contracts.  There is also the possibility of working with any ICO - a corresponding application has been developed for this. <br><br>  Thus, to work with the blockchain, you do not need to be an expert in programming, everything is implemented using a graphics system and software modules. <br><br><h3>  Bancor: $ 153 million </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c6c/eb7/f56/c6ceb7f56cd16a777b406dd61a30fa96.jpg"><br><br>  The first $ 140 million project managed to collect in just three hours.  The essence of the project is the ability to exchange tokens of the ERC20 standard (on the Ethereum blockchain) directly, without cryptocurrency exchanges.  This, according to experts, will give an increase in liquidity in the token air market, plus eliminate commissions in the system.  Transactions between different tokens, according to the developers, should be carried out with the help of smart contracts.  Plus, participants in the system will be able to invest in various tokens, allowing you to create ‚Äúbaskets‚Äù with several investment tools. <br><br>  For ordinary users, the advantage of Bancor is that you can link an account in any tokens to your bank card.  And one more thing - this is an opportunity for each participant in the system to issue their own tokens, which will be quoted from the moment of issue. <br><br><h3>  Tezos: $ 232 million </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dcb/13a/905/dcb13a9057f362828571185b2f7089fc.jpg"><br><br>  One of the most successful ICOs in history has been for the Tezos smart contract system.  The company's office is registered in Switzerland.  In just five days, the organizers were able to raise more than $ 137 million. <br><br>  Tazos call themselves the ‚Äúnew digital community‚Äù, and the platform itself is positioned as an alternative to the Ethereum network protocol of smart contracts.  Many companies use the Ethereum infrastructure in their work, but a safer alternative is being offered here.  What are the advantages?  For example, Tezos can update the protocol of decentralized circuits without hard forks. <br><br>  This is the first blockchain that allows you to control everything and everyone at the protocol level.  To do this, developed its own language of smart contracts, which is designed to facilitate formal verification.  Interestingly, Tezos developers can make changes to the system, but for this they will have to pay. <br><br><h3>  Filecoin: $ 257 million </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0de/8d8/94c/0de8d894ce853168204385a8a1974fab.png"><br><br>  The Filecoin project was launched by Protocol Labs not now, but in 2014.  The goal is to create an effective solution for storing any data.  At the heart of everything is the IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) decentralized network protocol.  This protocol, according to its creators, can replace HTTP with a peer-to-peer hypermedia communication protocol. <br><br>  What is the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project?  According to the plan, users install special software that allows you to store data on computer hard drives.  It is clear that very few people will want to do it just like that, so the organizers have provided the possibility of paying rewards.  It is produced in the form of Filecoins tokens.  They can be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies or fiat currency. <br><br>  By the way, the ICO was regulated.  That is, access to participation in it was available only to those participants who passed the verification process.  And these are large firms, banks and wealthy individuals.  Thanks to the regulated ICO, the organizers were able to fulfill the requirements of the US Security Exchange Commission, which in July announced the need to supervise the conduct of a number of ICOs. <br><br>  As already mentioned, ICO attracts more and more investors, the sums are collected huge, even for large companies.  Perhaps ahead are new records and new projects that will bring a lot of new things both into ordinary life and into business activities.  It is now clear that the blockchain is unlikely to be able to stop something, progress continues. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/339822/">https://habr.com/ru/post/339822/</a></p>
