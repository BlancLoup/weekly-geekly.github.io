Before the advent of modern technology giants such as Apple and Microsoft, the approach they used to display their products was practically non-existent.  In the success story of two long-time rivals, much more adventurism than we think today.  It is now that they have great potential for the realization of any adventures, at the beginning of their activities, none of them did not disdain to go by bootstrapping. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Apple chief evangelist wrote that one of the prerequisites of bootstrapping is to get to the market as soon as possible - the product or service should be brought to the market immediately.  Enterprises should act according to the ‚Äúsupply - refinement - supply - refinement - supply - refinement - supply ...‚Äù scheme (and not ‚Äúrefinement, refinement, refinement, supply‚Äù).  This approach has its pros and cons:

    <h5>  pros </h5><br>  - Immediate cash flow. <br>  - Objective feedback from the consumer. <br><br><h5>  Minus </h5><br>  - Tainted reputation in case of quality problems. <br><br>  Since the tarnished reputation can later turn into a serious obstacle to business, it is always damn difficult to make a choice between delivery and improvement.  When making this decision, you need to consider the following questions: <br><ul><li>  Does a product or service outrun competing products at the current stage of development? </li><li>  Is it possible to choose a small and isolated geographical area or market segment for the supply of a product or service, which will limit the potential damage to reputation? </li><li>  Is there a tolerant and understanding group of buyers willing to become guinea-pigs? </li><li>  How products correspond to the notion of introducing a new meaning into the world? </li><li>  How much does it meet customer needs? </li><li>  Can the product or service in its current form cause any harm to the buyer or in any way expose it to danger? </li><li>  Have enough tests been carried out <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro">in vitro</a> to carry them out in vivo? </li></ul><br>  At that time, Apple was trying to immediately withdraw its new products, regardless of the degree of their development, for the above reasons, but it seems that at the present time they <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/10/heres-how-apple-designs-experiences-for-devices-that-dont-exist-yet/">have moved</a> to a more advanced product output model. <br><br>  Apple, as you know, always tries to keep information about their future products under lock and key, but this does not mean that the company is waiting for the development of the device to create native software.  Moreover, both software and hardware does not appear in the company's depths from scratch, developed independently of one another.  How do you manage to invent and prototype product ideas with limited information or access to devices?  Consider this process in general terms. <br><br>  In fact, Apple is trying, as far as possible, to minimize the time and resources expended in the early stages of development, and to restrict access to the prototype of the product as much as possible.  Instead, the approach involves falsifying the functionality of the device or program being developed in order to improve the development process before real resources go to the project. <br><br>  For example, the development of an application for non-existent Apple Watch would begin with a series of static images and false interactivity using the simplest animation capabilities of a program, such as Keynote, without any programming at all.  For a start, would have to use a rather rough layout. <br><br>  The idea is that using fake applications and equipment on which it will work, you can gain experience using testers and testimonials that affect product development, even before a prototype is made or at least one line of code is written. <br><br>  Such reflection affects the development process itself, making it less costly, and more importantly, more flexible.  At the same time, the required flexibility of the development process can be achieved only if the forgery is carefully and skillfully crafted so that it is not perceived as an obvious fake.  Unlike real programming mode or production. <br><br>  Both for employees and for third-party developers, it is important that Apple, launching a new device, already has information about the trial operation of the software, although not every developer can work with finished products. <br><br>  The development cycle consists of three repetitive parts.  Development of a fake application or device, testing with real users and feedback, after which the fake is refined based on the feedback results and the next version of the ‚Äúproduct‚Äù is released.  Thus, product development does not physically begin until it is actually required to further advance the entire process;  hardware can be modeled using software and other workarounds, including the hidden replacement of automatic processes with manual ones. <br><br>  The strength of Apple, and the fact that it helps to stand out among its competitors, is its current ability to deeply develop products, especially impressive, with such a considerable degree of closeness of early models, which, in turn, is very important for all developers who feed a growing ecosystem of applications. and devices running on iOS and its derivatives. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291532/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291532/</a></p>
