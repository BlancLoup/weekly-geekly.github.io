But such a decision assumed that the child would get much richer practical skills, understand how cars are arranged (or watches - such options were also), after which, having also collected and disassembled their other toys (and leaving a bunch of unnecessary parts aside), he will understand that life is multifaceted, and just driving a car is not enough to penetrate into its essence. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/875/2db/42f/8752db42fc6448b2862180ac9070f316.png" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Professor Sri Nayyar of Columbia University for a long time delirious idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpopularizing digital photography among children, and his perennial fabrications (as well as his charges at the department), eventually led to what he decided to do a designer like those he saw in childhood - naturally adjusted to the current level of electronics and technology.  Considering his profile, it was not difficult for him to think out his idea practically before commercial realization, as a result of which a new-fashioned designer was born.

      The designer consists of several basic elements: two boards, one is a module with a matrix and a primary lens, the other hides all peripheral electronics and the main processor, a housing with a transparent back wall (so that the child does not forget what is inside), a flash, a battery, optical module in the form of a wheel and a dynamo.  The last is a sort of final touch in peak ‚Äúgreen‚Äù to show that the camera can be independent of the environment, which is quite significant. <br><br>  Special mention deserves the optical unit, which is, in fact, three additional nozzles (the lens itself is integrated into the matrix chip), packed in a wheel shape: normal, wide-angle and stereoscopic.  As can be seen in the diagram, the lens of the apparatus is located below, and on the top are just the corresponding holes for the viewfinder, which is completely optical here. <br><br>  Shooting looks simple: when you arrive at the site, turn the optical changer wheel, then sight and twist the generator knob, then simply press the shutter button.  There is no autofocus (there is no manual too, do not be alarmed), no frills, but it is clear how it works.  2-megapixel matrix inside it remains only to fix the masterpiece picture. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75772/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75772/</a></p>
