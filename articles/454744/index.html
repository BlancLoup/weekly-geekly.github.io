From 29 to 31 May, RigaDevDays conference was held in Riga.  It was the 5th anniversary year of the conference.  More than 600 participants gathered at the Forum Cinemas cinema to listen to reports on technologies - C #, Java, MachineLearning, Microservices, SQL. </p><br><p>  The conference was held in the cinema.  At first, I was skeptical about this, but as soon as I drowned in the most comfortable cinema chair with a view of the huge code screen, I realized that the cinema is the perfect place for conferences. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1 id="video">  Video </h1><br><p>  Videos of all reports will be available in a month, but for now you can watch the ‚Äúraw‚Äù recordings from hall 3, where there were reports about java, and from hall 11, where there were reports about microservices. </p><br><p>  Hall 3, Java Track, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DY5KOWbnbQXc">first day</a> <br>  Hall 3, Java Track, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DvesjvTyALrE">second day</a> </p><br><p>  Hall 11, Microservices, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dkrp8R2oH3JM">first day</a> <br>  Hall 11, Microservices, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DbMMNOKTpZM0">second day</a> </p><br><h1 id="top---7-dokladov--s-rigadevdays">  Top - 7 reports with RigaDevDays </h1><br><p>  <em>subjective, and only from the java track on which I was</em> </p><br><h3 id="sonic-pi-livecoding---sam-aaron">  Sonic PI Livecoding - Sam Aaron </h3><br><p>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y5KOWbnbQXc%3Ft%3D1413">Video</a> </p><br><p>  Keynouts are always mentally divided into several types: </p><br><ul><li>  inspirational (that's it) </li><li>  reviewers </li><li>  philosophical (as so) </li><li>  reflecting (like this) </li><li>  surprising (wow, how) </li></ul><br><p>  Sam Aaron was inspiring.  Sam offered to teach children how to program through music.  He himself claims that bit operations, recursion, are not as fun as creating DJ parties using their own code.  Programming is not only about writing business logic, it is also a way of self-expression.  Life will change if you find where to apply your skills to make the world a better place.  Such an inspiring keyout, after which you want to go or even run a code.  But not so fast!  At the end of the report, Sam uncovered his DJ-IDE to the fullest.  The film sound did its job - every note of the Sonic-Pi sounded like a trailer for a superhero movie. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fa/jp/5f/fajp5fjcxllvl3astf1k8-oz51e.jpeg" alt="image" align="left"><br><p>  Life hacking!  For those who love kodit to music, I advise <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQB04t2hxSBVTjxpbIHdI-w">Sam's YouTube channel</a> <br>  You can combine viewing live coding and DJ set.  Sam also has a cool DIY keyboard that I managed to take as soon as he left the stage. </p><br><h3 id="javanext-keeping-up-with-java---sander-mak">  Java.Next: Keeping Up With Java - Sander Mak </h3><br><p>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y5KOWbnbQXc%3Ft%3D5362">Video</a> </p><br><p>  Sander is an expert on modules in Java.  Even before they appeared, he had already made presentations on modules and even wrote the book <a href="https://javamodularity.com/">Java Modularity</a> .  In the report, he wrote a simple modular application, and then told about jshell and var.  Life hacking!  If you are interested in learning more about Java modules, there are several more of his reports on YouTube.  After reviewing everything, you will practically visit his paid workshop. </p><br><h3 id="spring-boot-the-ripper---part-1-2---evgeny-borisov">  Spring Boot the Ripper - Part 1, 2 - Evgeny Borisov </h3><br><p>  Video <a href="https://youtu.be/Y5KOWbnbQXc%3Ft%3D15578">Part 1</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/Y5KOWbnbQXc%3Ft%3D21021">Part 2</a> </p><br><p>  The dual report of Yevgeny Borisov, as always, gathered the full hall.  Previously, he read this report with Kiril Tolkachev, so this time I had to write and joke code myself.  ‚ÄúOld Friends‚Äù - a bee BeanFactory, a cheburashka, a spiderman, already well-known characters from previous reports are back in business.  Eugene in the form of live coding from start to finish wrote several applications on Spring Bute.  Added custom profiles, custom "conditioners", custom starter.  He told about the insides of Spring Bout.  For example, you knew that the "Hello world" in a spring boot has about four hundred bins in the list of bins, and this is the default!  Anyone who has a Spring Bout on the sale of the report will definitely be useful. </p><br><h3 id="iot-powered-by-microprofile---microservices-in-practice---rustam-mehmandarov-mads-opheim">  IoT powered by Microprofile - Microservices in practice - Rustam Mehmandarov, Mads Opheim </h3><br><p>  Rustam and Mads told how they did the lighting in the new office using microservices on the Microprofile framework.  Light bulbs in the office now react to the weather and the time of day.  Of course, all this is running in the docker and the docker compose.  The entire project infrastructure is built entirely using the Microprofile specification.  As a bonus, Rustam showed how you can change one web server to another with the help of one command.  And it all worked without errors, thanks to the fact that the web server implements one Microprofile specification. </p><br><h3 id="supersonic-subatomic-java-with-quarkus---burr-sutter">  Supersonic, Subatomic Java with Quarkus - Burr Sutter </h3><br><p>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vesjvTyALrE%3Ft%3D9270">Video</a> </p><br><p>  Boer Sutter wrote the app to-do list right on his report using the Quarkus framework.  All this in live coding mode.  He stopped the server completely a couple of times, and on the fly added entities ‚Äî controllers, dependencies.  Quarkus picked up everything and worked so fast that I wanted to find a catch somewhere - it could not be so perfect.  And at the end of the report, Bohr compiled the code into a native application that started in 0.025 seconds.  If only half an hour of the report and the developers of java would have taken him out of the hall in his arms.  And so he seems to have broken the loudest applause of the speakers. </p><br><p>  Sam Aaron received the previous loud ovations on loudness when the report ‚ÄúA computer will reboot in 59 seconds, 58 seconds, 57 seconds ...‚Äù jumped out on his report.  At this point, Sam did not quit telling the report, but rushed to run for the backpack to the gym. </p><br><h3 id="rsocket--new-reactive-cross-network-protocol---oleh-dokuka">  RSocket - new Reactive cross-network Protocol - Oleh Dokuka </h3><br><p>  On Oleg's report, the entire hall could have been chopped into Pakman in order to win a book.  And you could be showered with candies to explain what backpreassure is.  Oleg presented the RSocket protocol, which supports out-of-the-box backpreassure.  There were several implementations of the Pacman server on SocksJS, Grpc, RSocket on the demos.  It turned out that the influx of a large number of users survived only the RSocket server. </p><br><h3 id="busy-developers-guide-to-polytechnical-engineering---ted-neward">  Busy Developer's Guide to Polytechnical Engineering - Ted Neward </h3><br><p>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vesjvTyALrE%3Ft%3D29332">Video</a> </p><br><p>  Ted claims that the developer should be: </p><br><ul><li>  ‚ÄúPolyglot‚Äù, know several programming languages </li><li>  ‚ÄúPoly-repository‚Äù, know several databases </li><li>  ‚ÄúMulti-platform‚Äù, know several platforms </li><li>  study as sophisticated programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãas possible </li><li>  not just learning a language, but creating a pet project on it </li></ul><br><p>  PS </p><br><p>  The party was held in the open air with a delicious pilaf and two drinks at the expense of the conference, a stand-up performance and a DJ set by Sam Aaron.  The evening of the second day ended with the viewing of the film ‚ÄúDetective Pikachu‚Äù (no wonder we all gathered at the cinema) </p><br><p>  Thank you RigaDevDays! </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sv/v4/q6/svv4q6xi6jqyhf1hmapeh-k8qqo.jpeg"></p></div>
