  <section class="page js-page"><h1>‚ÄúFor Old Friendship‚Äù - how friends and acquaintances endure the brain to business owners</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When our business was just starting up, I thought that at first it would be possible to leave at the expense of numerous acquaintances.  They will buy laptops, advise the store to other friends - this will give at least some kind of a turn at first. <br>  Now, when the store has been living for 2.5 months, it became clear that the most difficult customers are friends and acquaintances. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Friends and acquaintances usually: <br>  - expect to get unrealistically low prices.  Many naively believe that I cheat on laptops at 50-100%.  Therefore, they think, for an old friendship through me, you can get a laptop 2 times cheaper than in a store.  This is not the case.  We now have in the store an extra 3%.  This is just enough to recoup the cost of the operator, courier, advertising and pay taxes.  The paradox is that even if you sell a friend a laptop AT ALL WITHOUT A PRICE, he will still think that you have earned it. <br><br>  - The longest are determined with a choice.  And at the same time they can get their doubts.  Today they want an Asus laptop in one price.  Tomorrow suddenly realized that they have half as much money, and they are already asking to see HP.  They can call ten thousand times, pouring out their doubts about the choice.  In fact, they themselves have already made their choice, but they expect that someone else will take the decision for them.  Time it kills just dofig.

      - they expect that after the purchase you will carry out free technical support for their computer for life.  And how else!  I sold the computer - now, as a friend, only I can put all the software on it, configure the network.  And if the Windows is buggy, it means that the computer is bad and I have to repair it. <br><br>  It turns out that selling something to friends and acquaintances is the very end of the mind.  And money from this is zero.  With regular customers, everything is a thousand times simpler and more profitable. <br><br>  And at the same time, I happily continue to help people whom I consider to be friends.  Ready to spend a lot of time and effort to help them.  Why it happens?  Mysterious Russian soul. <br><br>  Hey friends, anyone need a laptop? <br><br>  Cross-post "uncensored" in my <a href="http://alekspi.livejournal.com/">blog</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/37354/">https://habr.com/ru/post/37354/</a></p>
