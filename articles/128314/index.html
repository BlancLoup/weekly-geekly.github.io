  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Collection of statistics for desktop and mobile programs using Software Statistics Service</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day, dear habrasoobschestvo. <br><br>  Today I would like to talk about how you can get statistics on the use of developed programs, analyze it and draw the appropriate conclusions for your product. <br><br><h5>  Web services vs programs </h5><br>  It so happened that the development of web services of any type and complexity has one indisputable advantage - in each case, you can measure the effectiveness or even trite attendance of your product using various statistical systems, starting with domestic services such as Yandex.Metrica, and ending with various tools like Pingdom Tools or Google Analytics. 
      <br>

      If you develop desktop programs or mobile applications, it will be a bit more difficult to get statistics on the use of your products.  To do this, you have to either change the code, thereby increasing the number of lines, or use additional plug-ins and adjust them to your product. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Decision </h5><br>  Fortunately, the manufacturers of SaaS products did not sleep, and created their own solution to this problem.  It is called <a href="http://www.software-statistics-service.com/">Software Statistics Service</a> , and offers developers a convenient platform for analyzing their programs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/9f374393/c1696369/44869d23/b8880caa.jpg"><br><br>  The operation of the Software Statistics Service is as follows: developers are invited to register their product, get a unique Project Key, and use it to integrate a special module into your software.  After that, the updated product can be published - the statistics you need will begin to flow immediately after the appearance of the first user who downloads the release. <br><br>  You can view and analyze statistics on the Software Statistics Service website, thus saving yourself from problems with access to data from different computers or different cities.  The service offers several types of analytics: general information about software usage, user loyalty (measured in the number of program launches), popularity of using different versions of the product, information about users - OS version, screen resolution, RAM size, geography, statistics on the use of individual functions, buttons , program components and much more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/fe4ed8d9/5c2790c2/44b303ca/61596c12.jpg"><br><br>  Thus, developers will be able to obtain valuable data about their users - who they are, what computers they use, how often they run the program, what functions they use most often.  Analyzing statistics for different software versions can help to prevent possible errors even before the next release. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/e1343d57/ee1d7aa9/c5c2dc75/7b24d1bd.jpg"><br><br>  The integration of the Software Statistics Service into the product is facilitated by the fact that the service has developed native modules for popular development platforms - .NET, C ++, Java, Delphi, Microsoft Silverlight, Mac OS and others. Thus, if the software is developed on the basis of one of these platforms, then integrate the statistics module will be much easier. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/06097989/712dcd78/9bc60369/5c9e861c.jpg"><br><br>  Another interesting fact that I would like to draw your attention to is the compatibility of the Software Statistics Service with mobile operating systems - Windows Phone 7, Android and iOS.  What does this mean?  And the fact that all of the above also applies to mobile applications, which is an undoubted advantage.  Unfortunately, the free <a href="http://code.google.com/intl/uk/mobile/analytics/docs/android/">Google Analytics SDK for Android</a> , which is often used by mobile developers, does not provide a complete picture of what is happening - in fact, this is the same GA, but embedded in a mobile application on Android.  In view of the growing popularity of mobile applications and development for Android, Software Statistics Service can be used to accurately measure the popularity of programs on smartphones. <br><br>  And so what we have: <br>  <i>pros</i> <br>  - presence of native modules for .NET, C ++, Java, Delphi, Microsoft Silverlight, etc. <br>  - tracking different software versions <br>  - user statistics: OS, screens, geography <br>  - iron data: RAM, CPU frequency and number of cores <br>  - information on the use of individual functions, buttons and other program elements <br>  - integration with mobile platforms <br>  <i>Minuses</i> <br>  - the need to add code to your product <br>  - paid <br><br>  Based on the above, the downsides to the S3 are the necessary sacrifices that can be made for the sake of the ‚Äúcarrot‚Äù.  Speaking of payment: the service offers a free version, which is limited to one project and the ability to connect one account.  The cost of paid access to Software Statistics Service starts <a href="http://www.software-statistics-service.com/pricing">at $ 39 per month</a> .  The premium version includes the export of all types of data, as well as the ability to connect up to 10 projects simultaneously.  In addition, each tariff plan provides for a 30-day free period. <br><br>  Interestingly, Software Statistics Service is a Ukrainian development, the service was created by the Ternopil <a href="http://www.magneticone.com/">MagneticOne</a> company together with ELEKS Software. <br><br>  I would like to hear your opinion on this matter.  What services do you use for the analysis and statistics of your products?  Are they free / paid? <br>  Thanks for attention! <br><br>  <b>upd: a</b> representative of SSS <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/development/128314/">appeared</a> in the comments, promises a discount on the Unlimited tariff for the first ten members of the site who register on the site. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128314/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128314/</a></p>
