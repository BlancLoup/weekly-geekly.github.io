      We continue to publish useful materials that will help you in building effective marketing, since marketing is the only thing that you can‚Äôt use to us. <br>  Content marketing is a real nightmare for many companies, they don‚Äôt know how to manage it because they don‚Äôt know how to measure it.  In general, here is an article that will help solve this problem. <br><br>  Sincerely yours, <a href="http://landing.yamboks.ru/">Yambox</a> full-line operator <br>  ( <a href="http://landing.yamboks.ru/">Yambox</a> - turn your online store into a computer game) <br><br>  There is an old rule in management science: ‚ÄúIf you can measure, then you can increase it‚Äù <br><br>  This applies to content marketers too.  Without measuring the performance of your content, you cannot say for sure whether your marketing efforts are really successful or not. <br><br>  In order to fully appreciate the success of content marketing, you need metrics to help track conversions and the long-term economic impact of the content. <br><br>  In this article, we look at what indicators at which stage of the marketing campaign should be monitored. <br><br><h4>  <b>A simple scheme for measuring content performance</b> </h4><br>  One of the first things you need to understand about content marketing metrics is that not all metrics are equally useful at every stage of content upload. <br><br>  For example, when you start a completely new promotion campaign, you don‚Äôt actually have digital data to track the economic effect or click-through test.  At this stage of work, you will see much better results, focusing on generating traffic, rather than measuring conversion rates. <br><br>  It is necessary to split each campaign into separate phases and track the various indicators for each phase.  Thus, in the end, you will have three phases: <br><br><ul><li>  Phase 1: Traffic Generation </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Phase 2: Attraction </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Phase 3: Conversion </li></ul><br><br>  Let's look at each of these phases in more detail. <br><br><h4>  <b>Phase 1: Traffic Measurement</b> </h4><br>  When you start a new marketing campaign, for sure, the amount of network traffic is very limited.  At this stage, you should focus on getting as much network traffic as possible.  Once you have gained a certain number of people visiting your site, you can begin tracking loyalty and conversion levels. <br><br>  The most important metrics for this phase are: <br><br><h5>  <b>1. Unique visitors</b> </h5><br>  The number of (unique) visitors to your site is perhaps the most important metric at this stage.  This information shows exactly whether your marketing moves work or not.  Obviously, the higher this number, the better. <br><br><h5>  <b>2. Number of views</b> </h5><br>  This metric shows how many total pages people generally visit on your site.  This data can be important (especially for media companies), but it can also be misleading - website design, source of traffic, and even the specifics of your business can have a big impact on the number of page views.  Make such measurements, but do not make any important decisions based on these indicators. (Better focus on the unique visitors themselves). <br><br><h5>  <b>3. Backlinks</b> </h5><br>  High-quality SEO optimization is a by-product of any successful marketing campaign, and you need a large number of backlinks to get a good optimization.  Tracking the number of websites linking to your website allows you to measure content effectiveness.  In most cases, the higher this number, the better your ranking in search engines. <br><br><h5>  <b>4. Traffic source</b> </h5><br>  Track where new visitors come from to your site.  Do they find you only through a search engine?  Perhaps they came from any source that sent them to you, or from one of the social media platforms? <br><br>  Once you have identified your main sources, you will be able to promote your content, focusing on specific groups. <br><br>  Once you figure out what exactly is the main source of traffic and in accordance with this you will promote the content of the site. <br><br>  For example, the most traffic you get from Twitter, and that means your followers are interested in your content.  The next step is to post content in accordance with the involvement of only Twitter users, in accordance with their interests. <br><br>  This first phase usually lasts from one to three months, or until you create a content library and attract some traffic. <br><br><h4>  <b>Phase 2: Measuring Immersion in Your Content</b> </h4><br><h5>  <b>1. Bounce rate</b> </h5><br>  Once you have good traffic, it's time to regularly interact with your users and turn them into regular readers, not just visitors. <br><br>  To do this, you need to track the following indicators of immersion: <br><br>  The bounce rate is determined as follows: the percentage of visitors to a particular website that leave the site after viewing a single page. <br><br>  If this percentage of bounce is reduced, it means that your readers are increasingly immersed in your content.  Do not expect the bounce rate to decrease over night.  This is a very slow process of analyzing and distributing content to more actively engage the audience. <br><br>  You may ask: what is considered an acceptable failure rate? <br><br>  There is no single indicator for all.  The bounce rate varies by industry and type of content.  In essence, a bounce rate ranging from 26% to 40% is considered excellent for content-oriented sites, while a figure between 41% and 55% is something in between. <br><br><h5>  <b>2. New visitors vs.</b>  <b>Regular visitors</b> </h5><br><br>  This metric speaks for itself.  It compares the number of people constantly coming to your site and the number of new visitors. <br><br>  The number of regular visitors is useful information, as it certainly shows that your content is interesting and useful. <br><br><h5>  <b>3. Time spent visiting the site</b> </h5><br>  If users spend a lot of time on your site, it means that you have content that interests them. <br><br>  In addition, you can dig deeper and find out exactly which pages visitors spend most of their time on.  If your users spend a lot of time on any particular type of page, it‚Äôs worth making more of this content. <br><br><h5>  <b>4. Users share your content with others.</b> </h5><br>  Track what type of content from your site is shared or, as they say, people ‚Äúshare‚Äù.  It can be infographics, images, GIF - images, long or short messages. <br><br>  People share something with others only when they really like something.  Keep track of which type gets the most ‚Äúshare‚Äù and post more content of this kind. <br><br><h5>  <b>5. Number of comments</b> </h5><br>  The comment is a much greater return to the reader than the "balls" or "likes."  People only comment on articles if they find them particularly useful and interesting. <br><br>  Measuring the number of incoming comments is a great way to track loyalty.  In addition, by inviting users to share their stories or ideas, you will develop a public discussion.  And this is important if in your plans building a whole community. <br><br>  Phase 2 can last from three to six months. <br><br>
<h5>  <b>Phase 3: Measure Conversion</b> </h5><br>  Now that you have regular readers who are interested in the content of your site, it's time to turn them into potential customers and buyers. <br><br>  Your focus at this stage should be on measuring the performance of your content.  Here are the metrics that will help: <br><br><h5>  <b>1. Opt-in</b> </h5><br>  When users fill out your opt-in form (a person fills out a form on your site (for example, to receive a gift) and does not remove the check mark from the "yes, please send me your email newsletter!") This is a clear sign that they want to be up to date information on your site.  In the future, these are your potential customers. <br><br>  Compare the number of interested users and those users who came through the opt-in form. <br><br>  If you create relevant traffic and have a high level of user attraction to your site, your opt-in ratio should be close to 30%. <br><br><h5>  <b>2. Click through rate</b> </h5><br>  Clickthrough rate is the percentage of visitors to a web page that follow a hyperlink to a specific site. <br><br>  These links can in any way attract attention to themselves, the main thing is that your users click on it. <br><br>  For example, if you have an article on ‚Äúcontent marketing secrets‚Äù and a link that attracts attention to it, you need to count how many times the user clicked on the link against how many times it was displayed. <br><br><h5>  <b>3. The number of leads (users)</b> </h5><br>  This is a simple metric that tracks the total number of new leads from incoming sources. <br><br>  But it is not enough just to get new users, it is also necessary to measure their quality, that is, weed out ‚Äúbots‚Äù.  Use the LeadiD tool that automatically rejects them. <br><br><h5>  <b>4. The economic effect (ROI)</b> </h5><br>  This is probably the most important indicator, as well as the most difficult to measure. <br><br>  It is easy to understand what the economic effect is.  This is the total income received from content marketing companies, compared with the total investment in the creation and distribution of content. <br><br>  Two things are needed for this calculation: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Lifetime customer value <br>  ‚Ä¢ Method for tracking customer movements <br><br>  If you already have a CRM (Customer Information Management System), you can easily track the movements of your customers.  This will help you find out what specific content helped you make the sale.  And knowing the lifetime value of the client, you can calculate the actual revenue from each sale. <br><br><h4>  <b>Conclusion</b> </h4><br>  Measuring the success of content marketing is crucial if your goal is to get more traffic and make more sales.  At the same time, it is very important to measure the right indicators in the right phase. <br><br>  Focus on tracking traffic at the very moment when you launch a new marketing campaign.  After the number of visitors has increased, start tracking the level of attraction of your content. <br><br>  And finally, as soon as you get readers who regularly interact with your content, you can focus on tracking your conversion rate and calculate the economic effect of your marketing campaigns. <br><br>  Sincerely yours, <a href="http://landing.yamboks.ru/">Yambox</a> full-line operator <br>  ( <a href="http://landing.yamboks.ru/">Yambox</a> - turn your online store into a computer game) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300728/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300728/</a></p>
