This entertaining and ironic book reveals the main patterns and patterns of behavior that occur in the software development team.  The main roles of each of the team members, patterns of their behavior and examples of organizing the most effective interaction within the team of programmers are considered.  This book will help you assess the importance of the human factor in the software development process and learn how to build an effective team for an IT project of any complexity.

    <h4>  Who is this book for? </h4><br>  This book is intended primarily for software developers seeking to build their careers and create high-quality programs.  To the target audience of the book does not include CEOs, psychologists, managers, computer theorists <br>  and electronics specialists (although all these professionals can also enjoy reading).  When writing a book, we were guided by the following prerequisites: <br><ul><li>  the reader works in a team of programmers, for example, takes part in an open source project; </li><li>  the reader gets pleasure from software development and considers it a worthy and fascinating activity.  If you convert zeros into units and back to get rid of creditors, then you are hardly interested in self-development and career achievements. </li></ul><br>  Considering the methods of effective interaction of engineers with other people, we touch on issues that, as it may seem at first glance, are not related to the official duties of a programmer.  We are talking about how to effectively manage a team, build your ‚Äúroute‚Äù in an organization and build healthy relationships with users.  It may seem that these chapters are addressed solely to managers, but we are confident that in your career a moment will come when you yourself will inadvertently find yourself in such a role.  Drop doubts and keep reading!  All that is written in this book, of course, for software developers. <br><br><h4>  Warning: this book is not a technical guide. </h4><br>  First, a little about what you will find in this book.  Interested programmers like to read books in which specific problems are described with mathematical precision and for each is a solution procedure. <br><br>  In this book you will not find anything like this. <br>  Our book is dedicated to the human aspects of software development. <br><br>  People are complex creatures, or, as we like to say at conferences, ‚Äúhuge clusters of intermittent errors.‚Äù  The problems and solutions we are talking about are vague and hardly fit into a strict logical framework.  This book should be taken as a series of essays, because, in essence, the way it is.  In each chapter, we look at a set of interrelated problems (as a rule, in the form of stories), and then proceed to the study of solutions relating to the entire topic as a whole.  To fully absorb the material, hold the contents of several pages at the same time in your head, establish relationships using the right hemisphere of the brain, or, finally, just sleep with this book! <br><br>  All the names used in the examples have been changed to preserve the confidentiality of both positive and negative characters. <br><br><h4>  This book is about what is not taught in universities </h4><br> <a href="http://goo.gl/l9mp5J"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e4b/1cb/846/e4b1cb846847ecfb34af3511abe2ccf2.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Most programmers we know have spent from 4 to 10 years learning computer technology and programming.  At the time of this writing, we do not know a single course that teaches students how to communicate and collaborate. <br>  in a team or company.  Of course, during their studies, most students have to participate in a group project at least once, but to teach a person how to work successfully with other people and force him to work as a team is completely different things.  For most students, this experience ends in disappointment. <br><br>  Prototype: Team Geek: Software Developer's Guide to Working Well with Others <br>  Authors: Brian W.
