I noted that the latter was very lucky, because it is quite a rarity to be born in the thousandth year.  Then, thinking, he added that we were lucky, too, not so big, of course, but we met a millennium, which will not be met for another nine hundred years.  And then I thought about how sad it is that I was not destined to meet another millennium, to see how everything changed by the time, what humanity and technology will be like, what my descendants will be like.  This is very sad, but, arguing on the topic of death, I have always adhered to the view that death is a natural process, we must give way to the next generations and this is not discussed.  But then an idea occurred to me ... <a name="habracut"></a>

      From a technical point of view, the main problem of mass eternal life is the overpopulation of the planet by obsolete people who have not disappeared naturally.  It doesn‚Äôt matter if we are talking about a biological victory over the aging process or a transplant into synthetic (or artificially grown) bodies - we have no right to prolong our existence in this way, interfering with new generations (or putting their existence at risk), if, of course, we don‚Äôt us to other planets.  Besides, this is all technically very, very difficult. <br><br>  But what if you give up the physical body?  After all, in fact, I could write these lines, devoid of any body, having only the brain connected to the right interfaces.  If eternal life in the body interferes with others, then existence in the information space is not.  And you will agree that solving the problem of maintaining the life of the brain and providing interfaces for it, or creating an electronic analogue, copying the personality there is much easier than solving the problem of the existence of billions of immortal people and ensuring the functionality of immortal (replaceable) bodies.  In addition, the technology of preserving only the individual, could have a reasonable price.  The main thing is to pay for ‚Äúhosting‚Äù on time :) <br><br>  If you just leave the brain alive apart from the body - this is probably painful torture, but if you connect it to the interfaces of interaction with others (albeit the virtual world) - this is a good alternative to death.  After all, now on the Internet you can do an infinite number of different things: watch movies, read books, learn news, write something, communicate, work (?), Create (draw, write music, simulate), play online games.  Being in such a state, we could influence the real world, being already physically dead.  See how great-grandchildren grow, communicate with grandchildren "online."  Almost full life!  There are even positive aspects, like the absence of problems with the physical body: diseases, fatigue and the like.  And if the descendants pay "hosting", then the head does not need to be loaded with everyday problems: you can devote all the time to spiritual growth, the study of something or creativity.  How many opportunities!  Of course, there will be no smells or tastes, and you will not be able to embrace your living descendants, but the existence in the information network might be just the beginning.  We could wait, the blessing, being physically dead, is not difficult, and technologies could possibly develop into a full-fledged simulation of the world, with visual images, feelings and sensations.
