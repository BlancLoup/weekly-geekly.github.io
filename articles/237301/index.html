  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Brain Target- a program for objectifying the evaluation of the results of neurosurgical treatment of brain tumors</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Until recently, there was no objective way to evaluate brain tumors before and after surgical treatment.  Those.  surgeons selflessly operate on patients, but it is still extremely difficult to analyze the results of this.  The first domestic development in this direction was one of the startups GenerationS, the program of Sibneiro Brain Target.  Brain Target objectifies the results of neurosurgical treatment evaluation.  Roughly speaking, the surgeon does this not exactly subjectively, since there is no uniform assessment method.  A program Brain Target objectively evaluates the characteristics of the tumor by separating it from the blood, hemostatic agents and other things that can remain before and after the operation.  The Brain Target program analyzes CT and MRI images, then provides quantitative characteristics of the tumor.  After the operation, a CT scan and an MRI scan are used to collect all kinds of obscure phenomena: swollen brain tissues, blood, hemostatic substance, and it is much more difficult to disassemble them ‚Äúby eye‚Äù than just a tumor. <br><br>  At the moment, the program evaluates the results for only surgical treatment of glioblastomas and arteriovenous malformations.  The exact characteristics of the tumor before the operation make it possible to accurately draw up a ‚Äútechnical task‚Äù for the surgeon, but after the operation, it is more personal to prescribe post-operative therapy and a plan for further treatment. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Surgical treatment of brain tumors includes the opening of the skull - trepanning, and surgical excision of the tumor.  The basic principle of surgical treatment of brain tumors is the removal of as much tumor tissue as possible and the maximum preservation of healthy tissue is possible.  Modern surgery today in its arsenal has not only a traditional scalpel, but also other tools that allow you to more safely excise the tumor - for example, endoscopic methods that even allow you not to open the skull, as well as the use of laser or high-intensity ultrasound for excision of soft tissues . <br><br>  The team of Sibneiro LLC knows firsthand what neurosurgery is and came to its development after Gleb Sergeyev (idea author, neurosurgeon) ran into the problem of objective evaluation in practice.  Statistics of complications due to this cause confirmed the urgency of the problem.  The main value of the development is that it will significantly increase the quality of care and save losses due to complications after operations, which only in federal clinics by 14 billion rubles annually.  A small, but experienced and talented team of Sibneiro LLC took up the search for a solution; these are three people: <br><br>  CEO - Sergeev Gleb Sergeevich, neurosurgeon, author of the idea, development of software algorithms.  Education - Medical (NGMU) <br>  STO - Leonid E. Kalneus, who wrote a software solution; <br>  CMO - Sevastyanov Alexander Alekseevich, responsible for marketing, promotion and sales of the product. <br><br>  About 200 thousand people die from cancer in the country every year, therefore, a startup is certainly socially significant.  Let's cheer for him together in the GenerationS contest and hope that he will find his investor. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/237301/">https://habr.com/ru/post/237301/</a></p>
