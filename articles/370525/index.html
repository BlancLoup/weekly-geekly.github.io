Many providers try to provide their subscriber with specialized services, such as: installation of software, antivirus programs, settings for subscriber equipment, and the like.  Such an attitude to the client not only increases his loyalty, but also allows the operator to earn an extra penny, which, as we know, is never superfluous. <br><br>  However, the ‚ÄúMoscow city telephone network‚Äù in here went much further, having developed for subscribers a whole line of completely diverse services from fixing a crane to replacing the screen on a smartphone.  The range of services under the general name ‚ÄúHome Operator‚Äù is a full-fledged customer service, for the most part not intersecting with the operator‚Äôs main activity. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The goal of transforming into a multi-service operator who could provide customers with a wide range of diverse services was delivered to MGTS in 2013.  Initially, the company focused on offers that are directly related to the fiber optic network.  In the future, the list of services began to grow.

      The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãorganizing a home service at MGTS was born out of a constant request from subscribers, who often turned to installers with requests to fix the lock and any household appliances.  After a thorough analysis of the market in MGTS, they understood the prospects for a new direction.  As a result, a separate business line came into being. <br><br>  Currently, in addition to standard household services (plumbing, electrical and minor household repairs), MGTS provides furniture assembly services, computer assistance, calibration and installation of housing and communal services meters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3af/7e4/655/3af7e4655b7549e1baa553273f49d9b4.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/181/737/836/18173783631e41b3a4703dc5dba355dd.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The client can use the periodic or package offer.  Periodic is usually one type of work performed on certain dates (cleaning an apartment several times a month and the like). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9ad/301/ad3/9ad301ad336640ba94773c3d73b41a12.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Package offers also include several types of services in one visit to the client.  For example, removing and hanging curtains, washing windows, radiators and heating pipes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/87a/7a6/d26/87a7a6d26d7b4f29a47c209cba2e8194.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Almost fifty percent of applications are carried out by MGTS specialists, while the other half is taken up by the operators partners.  Most likely the companies specializing in rendering cleaning and other household services. <br><br>  Despite the fact that the project is still in pilot stage, the representatives of the operator already recognize its expediency and the need for its further development.  This can be judged at least from the fact that a special mobile application was developed to order the ‚ÄúHome Operator‚Äù services. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e4a/c74/766/e4ac74766b064b0cacbb60787523c6ba.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Applications are accepted by call to the office and through the application.  Coordination and distribution of orders is based on our own IT-development, which allows you to remotely and quickly build and adjust the entire logistics chain. <br><br>  The Home Operator service only works within Moscow and the Moscow Region.  The service users are not only MGTS subscribers, but also other telecom operators.  With this approach, you can also entice subscribers to your side.  As emphasized in the company, more than 20% of customers apply for the service again, and 90% recommend MGTS services to friends and acquaintances. <br><br>  The success of services from the category of "husband for an hour" says that the day is near when other major federal operators pick up the idea.  Indeed, in the field of "washing floors", the struggle for their subscriber can unfold. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370525/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370525/</a></p>
