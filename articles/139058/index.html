      The smartphone supports GSM / GPRS / EDGE (850/900/1800/1900 MHz) and UMTS (900/2100 MHz) networks. <br>  By the budget devices it can also be attributed to a 3.2-inch capacitive HVGA screen, built-in 2 megapixel camera with fixed focus and missing flash. <br><br>  The first glance at the characteristics allows you to understand what saved here, in order not to lift the price of the device too much and how the manufacturer intends to position this smartphone. <br>  This is clearly the youngest model in the line, for those who need to use two SIM cards, but still more for calls than for the Internet or SMS.  Due to the small, albeit high-quality screen, using the on-screen keyboard to type a large amount of text will not work.  You can install specialized programs like Swype to speed up typing, but not all will go to such difficulties. <br><br>  The smartphone has a G-sensor, digital compass, FM radio and proximity sensor. <br><br>  In the process of testing I ran into the fact that the latter does not work very well, which causes some inconvenience - the call often hangs on waiting when applied to the ear.  This means that the proximity sensor does not work immediately, but with some delay. <br>  I have already talked about the operation of two SIM cards in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/android/131803/">Highscreen dvuhsimochnik</a> reviews, so I will not dwell on this, I will only say that I liked the implementation of the location of the slots for two SIM cards and the convenience of extracting a sim from any of them in this Jet Duo The moment the developers are really well thought out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d5e/f55/fcc/d5ef55fcc5c1ab7470e69385198109ce.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d1b/bd5/359/d1bbd5359b6a275c9e970f565209ac2d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Structurally, the smartphone is a sort of ‚Äúremnant‚Äù, which has already become familiar to us on other phones with a touch screen, but at the same time the Jet Duo still has some individual features.  The battery cover is made of matte plastic, which does not slip in your hand and, at the same time, does not collect fingerprints in large quantities, like soft-touch coating.  I put a plus. <br><br>  The edge of the display is made of plastic that is already glossy, it looks neat, at the bottom of the phone it protrudes slightly above the screen plane, apparently, to prevent accidental pressing of the touch key block under the screen.  The phone does not have physical keys or joysticks, apparently, this is done to reduce the physical size of the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/841/287/0e9/8412870e99ebfc4d3e2b7673295c9996.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The assembly is of high quality, there is no backlash and squeaks, there are no significant gaps or gaps.  Cooperation with large factories in China, which produce good equipment and monitor the quality of products, has an effect. <br><br>  From the physical controls on the ends of the device there is only an on / off button on top and a volume rocker on the right side.  It is also located at the bottom of the jack for connecting the cable or charging MicroUSB, which is good news.  In general, I like the course on the unification of the connectors for charging.  chosen by many manufacturers, it allows not to carry a bunch of cords and chargers, but to use universally one.  Yes, and a chance to find a suitable cable from friends at a visit is significantly higher.  This is a plus.  The connector does not have a plug that protects against dust and small debris - this is a minus.  This may be especially relevant to smokers, since tobacco particles are accumulated in their pockets, which can significantly clog up an important connector of your favorite phone. <br><br>  I will say about the set of delivery - there are only pluses and enthusiastic words. <br>  In addition to the expected cable for synchronization and charging, as well as a charger with a USB connector, they included a good headset, a 4 GB memory card and, attention, a protective film, exactly the size of the screen.  I do not recall in recent years a single phone, in a set with which they would specifically put a protective film.  It's nice, damn it, there is no need to run around and look for a standard-sized film, and then it is difficult to customize it under your phone and try to stick it carefully with the mats.  Plus, without a doubt. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4e7/ffe/ca6/4e7ffeca6d67fd70768347f4db098a2a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Let us turn to the experience of use.  Android 2.3.4 OS is installed in the phone, the system works without brakes, flipping screens and the menu is smooth.  It's nice to use the device.  The placement of the 3.5 mm headset or headphone jack seemed a bit strange to me - it is located at the junction of the back cover with the front of the phone, right on the pronounced edge.  Not deadly, by itself, but not very convenient, again - there is no plug.  Minus. <br><br>  The multimedia speaker is located on the back side, to the right of the camera, it is loud enough, there should be no problems with missed calls due to the volume of the device. <br>  What can be said about the dynamics of conversational.  I will make a reservation right away, I cannot be one hundred percent sure that the problem is of ‚Äúiron‚Äù quality, but when using the phone at maximum volume, the conversational speaker of the interlocutor is heard poorly, it is difficult to distinguish the spoken text.  At the maximum volume, background noises are heard, a slight rattling that makes it difficult to distinguish the interlocutor's speech.  The presence / absence of the necessary speech codecs may also be to blame, so I would like to compare my experience with someone else to understand the nature of the problem.  However, it is worth it when buying separately to check this point and pay attention to the possibility of such a problem.  Maybe this is the problem of the test sample, which in serial devices will already be fixed. <br>  This is not very critical, but in a noisy environment it will be difficult to talk. <br><br>  There is GPS in the device and it works fine, although I would not use such a small phone as a navigator, and the maximum is for orientation in unfamiliar terrain.  There are no complaints. <br><br><h5>  Total dry residue: </h5><br><br>  + Convenient and compact smartphone with two SIM cards based on Android. <br>  + High-quality assembly. <br>  + A good processor for comfortable work with the phone <br>  + All necessary communications <br>  + Decent package. <br><br>  -Not the most capacious battery, which is especially critical for a dvuhsimochnika. <br>  -Too small display for convenient work with the text. <br>  - Not a very good conversational speaker. <br><br>  Price for <a href="">Yandex.Market</a> at the request of <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/kaliostro/" class="user_link">kaliostro</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139058/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139058/</a></p>
