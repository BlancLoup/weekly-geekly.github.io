  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The crisis of the genre</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Well, my little lovers of world finance, my favorite readers of FT, WSJ and other obscene reading books, well, what can I do to please you today?  I don‚Äôt even know - you probably read Reuters with Bloomberg in the morning FT didn‚Äôt have anything good, even the yellow press is full of archshit headlines about how bad things are and how bad things are end of fiscal year. <br><br>  On the one hand, it is even good.  Here, for example, before the crisis, everyone shouted about bad Russia and small, but proud Georgia.  Yeah, oh, how they shouted, and even the same FT and WSJ did not forget to shout (however, immediately taking a serious look, and talk about how it will affect the P / E in the oil industry, where Brent will go tomorrow and what will happen to the blue ones chips).  But here, you understand, the crisis has come - and immediately a new, much more interesting topic for headlines has appeared.  Well, what could be there, its own snot is saltier. <br><br>  Here, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/massmedia/41859/">comrades from the next topic</a> ask me - what else to write about, if not about the crisis?  And if you write, what and in what tone?  Well, how do I know, you are my marines, three parish classes, and even with an unshaven snout - to the front office.  Here, after all, you know, what the matter is - the crisis is not only and not so much in finance.  The crisis is, you understand, in people: after the Lemons brothers ordered to live long (and in fact - long before, even when the North-Rock Bank gave its soul to God, and quite precisely - when Fanny May walked around the world - from what he did it - another story), people are nervous, you know, started.  And when a person is nervous - he creates something - he does not know.  And people went to withdraw money from deposits - to take away hard earned money from banks. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It would be half-woes.  So those who are <s>richer</s> smarter than everyone have always believed that ‚Äústoring money in a bank is nonsense.  it‚Äôs safer to buy shares of some company ‚Äù- and they bought, that is, shares.  And note, too, got nervous - and quickly ran these shares to sell.  And the stock market is not Baba Klava at the village bazaar.  There is panic love and smell for ten miles - the <i>stock went down</i> .  That is, we first crawled, then crawled faster, then we flew, and then we have, my dears, what we have. 
      <br>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      <br>
      And we have this.  There was a general panic.  All sell notes, bonds, stocks and in general all that is at any price - just to merge them from hand, and get cash.  This is a matter of what - on the one hand, if everyone supported the actions, then, you see, there would be no crisis (I‚Äôm lying, of course, it would, but the other).  But everybody thinks - I will hold up, but <i>they</i> will sell!  And the stock, mean, fall!  And I, therefore, will become poorer?  No, I‚Äôd better right now, for whatever amount I‚Äôm selling, and even if the grass doesn‚Äôt grow there. <br><br>  She, in fact, is not growing.  She will not grow now.  Until what time?  To me here, you are my little ones, it seems that now until we reach the lowest point of the crisis, whatever it may be, the markets will not calm down.  Everyone will sell everything, everything will fall (however, due to constant rate cuts, money will become cheaper, and cash will not guarantee the safety of this money at all).  That is, until we reach the bottom, we don‚Äôt roll back there properly, until everyone is convinced that it won‚Äôt be worse, because there‚Äôs just no worse ‚Äî there‚Äôs no need to wait for improvements.  But when it comes, how it will look and how it will end, it is, financially savvy, you are a very different tale. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/42035/">https://habr.com/ru/post/42035/</a></p>
