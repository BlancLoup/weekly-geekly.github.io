In fact, work in the field of IT is not a hindrance to personal life, but quite the opposite.  On the eve of Valentine's Day, iOS developer Or Ron told how he won the heart of his bride with the help of UX. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bbb/0f6/16d/bbb0f616d85744f59e529b5e5d4a6a80.jpeg"></div><br>  ‚ÄúThe beginning of this story was laid by my irrepressible passion for side projects and difficult tasks.  As a software developer, I am constantly looking for cool projects that I could take to work.  When I decided to make a proposal to my girlfriend, I immediately understood: you need to use this passion to come up with the perfect personalized script. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I started brainstorming by defining three main goals for myself: <br><br><ol><li>  An experience that would be fun, exciting and tailored to it; </li><li>  Surprise and secrecy.  I wanted very much that at some moment she was like this: ‚ÄúAw, Snap!‚Äù And began to realize that I had given her tips all week. </li><li>  Something unusual that she had never seen before. </li></ol><br>  <b>By trial and error</b>

      My first spontaneous thought was to make the game - games are fun to develop, and of course playing them is also fun.  But the more I thought about it, the more I lit up with the idea, the clearer it would become: it would give me pleasure a good game made for me personally, but my girlfriend doesn‚Äôt like them at all.  If I had developed a game for her, she would probably have put the phone aside, even without completing it to the end.  It was necessary to invent a new concept, corresponding to her own, her preferences. <br><br>  Something universal!  Yes, it is universal.  I started thinking about the concept of an application that would unite everything that she likes.  General idea?  An application that invites the user every day to perform an action, and then gives the opportunity to upload a photo in which he is captured during the task.  Simple and straightforward.  There was only one thing left - to make a list of what she likes to do the most. <br><br>  <b>Personalization</b> <br><br>  Someone may argue that after eight years of living together there shouldn't be any problems with this, and I myself can confirm that up to 75% of the points from the final list would have been thought of by one, but asking is always the most reliable.  If she has a hand in creating the list, then I can be sure that she will like it. <br><br>  Therefore, three weeks before the appointed date, I began to tell her about my new project called The ODI Challenge.  She thought it was an abbreviation for the October Instagram Challenge, but the initiates (i.e., I) knew that in fact it was I DO (agree) backwards.  The application gives the user one task every day - something pleasant to disrupt the daily routine.  What is funny, she liked the idea itself, but the name didn‚Äôt drop it.  We decided that the name would be temporary, and then the first thing we did was to brainstorm together in order to decide on the draft design of the application and, of course, the list of tasks. <br><br>  It didn't take us long to make a list that she truly loves: <br><br><ul><li>  Call three people and just say you love them; </li><li>  Eat a piece of chocolate in the company of a loved one; </li><li>  15 minutes to read something interesting; </li><li>  Take a walk; </li><li>  Buy something that you really want; </li><li>  Listen to 3 favorite songs; </li><li>  Meet a friend or loved one; </li><li>  Hug the one you love; </li><li>  Impromptu to arrange a picnic. </li></ul><br>  <b>The first design option</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6bb/819/ca9/6bb819ca9d3c4e649199560c60bacfa9.png" width="500"><br><br>  That was the draft design sketch (picture above).  I knew that nothing more complicated would be needed, but the interface should have left a feeling of a full-fledged application.  To convince my girl that it is real, you had to decorate it. <br><br>  Sketching the first version, I sent it to my friend and wonderful designer Eyal Kimhi with a request for help.  He immediately offered exactly what was needed: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c0c/7bb/305/c0c7bb305e524d148c6e10781d9da9e1.png" width="500"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99e/536/12f/99e53612fe474e33b191f23a3a3d7c08.png"><br><br>  <b>Jedi mind games</b> <br><br>  I built the ‚Äúready for the test‚Äù version of the application and wrote in the code that the task concerning the picnic should jump out on Saturday - the day on which I appointed the proposal itself.  Now it was a small matter - to plant it on ODI. <br><br>  The first three days I invariably reminded her every morning to check her ODI.  Relying on my words, she believed that the actions are chosen completely random.  Little by little she began to look forward to the daily tasks.  Of course, we selected everything that she liked!  By the fourth day, she finally got involved - she began to check ODI herself in the mornings and plan how to perform the task during the day.  Everything seemed to be going as planned ... <br><br>  <b>Sod's Law</b> <br><br>  Six days after installing the application, she is firmly hooked on him and was happy.  She had a great week doing her favorite things, and I was anticipating a Saturday picnic and preparing for it. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the law of meanness works like a clock.  Saturday morning came, and, barely opening my eyes, I saw that it was raining outside the window.  My girlfriend went to the gym, and I was sitting at home and was freaking out.  How do we go on a picnic in such slush?  Maybe steal from her phone and make a new version of the application, where the picnic will be postponed to another date?  I decided to wait for her and act according to circumstances. <br><br>  An hour later, she opened the door and announced: "Today we are going on a picnic!".  I was a bit taken aback, but I decided to play along: he said that it was wet on the street, so it‚Äôs better to give up on a task today and have a picnic on some other day.  She immediately replied: ‚ÄúThat's the whole point of ODI!  You need to be serious about tasks, break the usual flow of the day, just take and do.  Let's go to!". <br><br>  It struck me to what extent she was involved.  My plan worked even better than I expected!  I showed a little more discontentment so that she would not suspect anything, and finally gave way. <br><br>  And here is a happy ending.  This is a story about the engagement. <br><br>  The picnic was excellent.  I knelt on one knee, asked a cherished question and put a ring on her finger.  She was shocked.  I began to explain to her what she had been doing all week and what it was all about.  She needed a couple of minutes to recover and put everything in its place, but ultimately she was delighted. <br><br>  For a week, she did what she loved most of all, day after day, and the culmination was a marriage proposal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/50a/537/cd1/50a537cd178246ebb229a998cff0fe6c.png"><br><br>  By the way, she said: "Yes." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/320796/">https://habr.com/ru/post/320796/</a></p>
