This is a light, double, almost minimally accessible displacement bathyscaphe, designed specifically for diving from luxury yachts.  With a height of 1.8 meters, a length of only 3 meters and a weight of 3.3 tons, the Triton 1000 can be operated on virtually any boat of the middle class. <br><br>  But apart from the opportunity to carry the bathyscaphe with him on a personal boat, Triton provides passengers with almost unprecedented comfort for such a device: leather seats with massage will not allow the ass to sit out (or whatever the rich), a huge glass bubble does not prevent the underwater world from viewing.  This mini sub has even an air conditioner. <br><br>  Despite the fact that Triton 1000 was conceived as a very easy-to-use bathyscaphe, where everything is controlled by joysticks and a computer, the manufacturing company provides immersion and control courses completely free of charge, making the purchase a little more than a half million dollars really profitable ! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  2. <a href="http://www.hovercraft.com/content/index.php%3Fmain_page%3Dindex%26cPath%3D2">The Flying 19XRW Hoverwing Hovercraft</a> - a flying hovercraft, <b>$ 54,000</b> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3e4/ed1/25e/3e4ed125e69e1dfa9bad35ddbefd1589.jpg"><br>  Tired of high society?  Then it's time to leave the secular affairs and go on a journey on this truly unique car.  <b>UH-19XRW Hoverwing</b> from Universal Hovercraft is a hovercraft equipped with wings, which allows it to fly above the ground at a height of 2 meters.  This allows you to take off over obstacles and potentially impassable places (for example, the mouth of a turbulent river), as if you had never left your Rolls-Royce.  In addition, in order to fly (or ride) on this thing, you absolutely do not need a pilot's license - it is registered as a boat in most countries of the world.

      Well, if you conquer the airspace does not pull - the wings can be unfastened, and then you get just a luxurious and very powerful hovercraft.  Potentially, he is able to transport 6 passengers to places where a person‚Äôs foot has not yet stepped.  And the interior of the boat can be changed as your heart desires - at least put a bed there. <br><br>  3. <a href="http://www.tecaeromex.com/ingles/RB-i.htm">Tecnologia Aerospacial Mexicana Rocket Belts</a> - Mexican jetpack, <b>$ 250,000</b> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1a4/388/007/1a438800772ffc20f3a5a6d51564c7c5.jpg"><br>  I once wrote about these satchels from the Mexican company Tecnologia Aerospacial Mexicana, as a device capable of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/26542/">making a superhero</a> even from a jerk.  But, in this case, to repeat - is not a sin.  With this device behind him, everyone will be able to soar like Icarus, but without the tragic consequences, at a speed of up to 20 km / h.  The James Bond jetpack is far from new in the modern world, the first such ideas appeared in the 60s of the last century, but they found their practical realization only now. <br><br>  By paying once a quarter of a million ‚Äúevergreens‚Äù, the company will provide you with a fully tested, made to the right size, jet engine behind your back, but also a special machine for producing rocket fuel at home, a full course of training and year-round support.  It sounds like a very good idea for a bored millionaire - the opportunity to fly over his own villa with a backpack behind him, according to rumors, attracts so many. <br><br>  4. <a href="http://www.hoverit.co.uk/profile.html">The Hovering "Lounger"</a> - a levitating chair, <b>$</b> <a href="http://www.hoverit.co.uk/profile.html">13,336</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a3a/bad/55a/a3abad55a13692390dcdfd693bb12461.jpg"><br>  Although this device can be called a chair with a big stretch, the acrylic design is much more like a chaise longue.  Believe me, seeing the <b>Lounger</b> for the first time you think about only one <b>thing</b> - in this room, Star Wars was filmed a minute ago, and now the entire film crew and actor are hiding in the closet.  But they are there, of course, no. <br><br>  But there is a company HoverIT, which produces a large number of various "flying" furniture - I just chose the best for you.  In the air, a chaise longue is hanging due to powerful magnets located in the legs of the rack.  As you can see, there is nothing but reinforced acrylic and magnets in the construction, and in this form the Lounger will be the maximum decoration of the interior.  I advise you to take a favorite blanket, a book and drag the chair to the fireplace.  It will not be difficult to do this - it was prudently supplied with wheels. <br><br>  5. <a href="http://www.gizmag.com/go/7030/">Luvaglio First Luxury Notebook</a> - individual laptop, <b>$ 1 000 000</b> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2de/332/628/2de332628b94efe97f78f82a7de5e079.jpg"><br>  Stop staring at the price, better read this - <b>Luvaglio</b> , one of the most expensive and well-known manufacturers in the world of everything, huge grandmothers, also took up laptops.  For a start, let's look at what this laptop definitely cannot cost that much money: it‚Äôs a 17-inch widescreen LED monitor, a 128 GB SSD drive and a Blue-Ray drive.  But at least one of those present here knows how much a black diamond costs, which here functions as a power button when placed in a special hole;  which, at the same time, makes it also a kind of identification key?  So I do not know, but I guess that a lot. <br><br>  Luvaglio desk works on the principle of "best customers", which means this is only one thing - a very small number of people can have such a laptop.  Given the British passion for authenticity, I think no more than 5 laptops will go around the world.  But everyone who wants to pay such huge money for, in general, a laptop can choose materials, accessories and devils knows what else they like.  Do you need silicon for the processor from the French Riviera or will you take a domestic one? <br><br>  6. <a href="http://www.panasonic.com/consumer_electronics/plasma_central/103plasma/default.asp">Panasonic PDP Widescreen</a> - plasma "box" more than the walls in your home, <b>$ 70,000</b> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/070/a50/c5f/070a50c5f5564f8ada6d4a366aece82a.jpg"><br>  <b>The Panasoni 103 "PDP Widescreen</b> is a very, very large TV, with a 16-bit progressive widescreen display and a Full HD matrix, a resolution of 1920 x 1080, a contrast ratio of 5000: 1 and, finally, 4096 levels of color gradation. really looks like blood, not ketchup, tomato paste, instant juice, or something else. <br><br>  Many new technologies make viewing a true, unclouded, pleasure.  The Real Black Creation feature causes the dark to contrast with the light so that the shadows fill with rich color;  Contrast Management does not control the entire image, but in parts, exposing different values ‚Äã‚Äãto different areas on the screen;  and Motion Pattern Noise Reduction optimizes the picture in case the movements in the frame produce visual noise. <br><br>  7. <a href="http://www.divapor.com/">DI Vapor Cosmo TV Luxury Tab</a> - Jacuzzi and TV, <b>$ 7,000</b> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b34/227/493/b342274935a939fbc68393011aeac1bd.jpg"><br>  The full name of this advanced bathtub is <b>Di Vapor's Cosmo B-DV003 TV</b> and it‚Äôs gorgeous.  There is: a 17-inch waterproof monitor with a remote control and a video input for connecting a DVD player, TV, or whatever you have. <br><br>  In addition, there are: a touch panel to control all possible modes, automatic shutdown of water cannons, and them: 7 hydro-massage, 9 for massage bubbles, 6 for the back. <br>  Thought everyone?  There is also an underwater light, a fully customizable FM radio with memory function, a handheld shower, a water level sensor, a soft headrest and, inhale, an RCD device for breathing under water.  So, just in case. <br><br>  8. <a href="http://www.venturi.fr/-Fetish-.html">Venturi Ferish Sports Electric Vehicle</a> - Electric Fetish, <b>$ 660,000</b> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/921/59b/4b8/92159b4b80fe2b9ec2f9aaa4a68acca7.jpg"><br>  The car that looks at you with predatory and hungry eyes is called <b>Venturi F√©tish</b> and its high price is due to its origin - it is from Monaco.  This is the world's first double electric sports car, issuing something about 250 hp, with acceleration to "hundreds" in 5 seconds.  The maximum speed, unfortunately, is limited to 160 km / h - which, in general, is not so bad considering that the gearbox is missing as a given. <br><br>  A distinctive feature of F√©tish is that, thanks to an electric motor, all the torque of 220 Nm is available at any speed and speed.  This means that from 100 km / h to 160 km / h the car accelerates almost the same as from zero to a hundred.  The trip distance is 250 km on lithium-ion batteries, which are fully charged in 3 hours from the home network. <br><br>  And as a small bonus, with each Venturi Fetish comes a WiMax module with the ability to connect a computer. <br><br>  9. <a href="http://www.sooloos.com/www/the-system.php">Sooloos Sound System</a> - home multimedia center, <b>$ 12,000</b> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b96/d99/cf3/b96d99cf390f89e2eae439e02b4569ba.jpg"><br>  In truth, the <b>Sooloos Sound System</b> consists of a large number of devices for storing, listening and managing a music collection, and in the picture above is the Sooloos <b>Control: One</b> module, a touch panel for selecting favorite songs and clips. <br><br>  In order to store songs imported into the Sooloos media library from your computer or CDs, you need to purchase Twinstore - this is the name of a 1 TB RAID array on liquid cooling.  The whole system is compatible not only with digital reproducers (speakers), but also analog ones, so the favorite Infinite Wisdom Grande set (below) will connect without any problems. <br><br>  Sooloos Sound System can be controlled from a standard monitor, computer, iPhone or even a browser.  In addition, the entire music system can be ordered already with your favorite collection on board, so that you do not have to bother about this topic yourself.  And if you want to buy new music on the CD - no need to go to the store, just leave the order and the company will send you the original music disc and the second one, encoded in a special way, for instant music import into the system. <br><br>  10. <a href="http://dvice.com/archives/2008/08/dry_water_massa.php">The Dry Water Massager</a> - luxury enjoyment at home, <b>$ 29,500</b> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/917/f8e/4f9/917f8e4f9f956bfe04e874056d6db5f9.jpg"><br>  This ... massager on the basis of "dry water" usually costs in 5-star hotels, but if there is a little extra money and desire, then you can order one yourself and go home.  28 massaging jets inside this ... coffin of pleasure will do a Shiatsu massage all over the body in a matter of minutes.  Aromatic diffuser stimulates relaxation, softening the skin with various oils <s>and seasonings before frying</s> .  If this is still not enough, then inside there is a 7-inch LCD-monitor and a DVD-player that allows you to connect even an iPod.  The sound, by the way, is also very good - it comes from the built-in Bose speakers. <br><br>  11. <a href="http://www.fergusonhill.co.uk/product_details.php%3Fid%3D3">The Ferguson Hill Horn Speaker System</a> - clear sound from transparent speakers, <b>$ 17 851</b> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2df/7d4/2a4/2df7d42a4d7454e3c422988c1a7dedba.jpg"><br>  These huge and very unusual looking loudspeakers are made by the American company <b>Ferguson Hill</b> and give a sound from 150 Hz to 20 KHz, which, as you can see, is very much.  But the most important thing is not even in this, but in the exceptional purity of the reproduced sound, dynamics and detail.  The non-standard form makes them very effective, such a speaker only needs 5 watts in order for you to think: ‚Äúneither ** I imagine the volume‚Äù.  This allows <b>Hill Horn</b> to be installed on the basis of even low-power amplifiers. <br><br>  Amplifier power recommended by the manufacturer for these speakers: from 3 to 50 watts, they are also ideal for sound quality add-ons - what if you want to hear a royal symphony orchestra at home.  And to buy such a system for something else, in my opinion, is simply blasphemous. <br><br>  12. <a href="http://liveluggage.com/">Power-Assisted Suitcase</a> - semi-automatic suitcase, <b>$ 1,365</b> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6d3/335/639/6d3335639d7ce6c24dd20dddfbabc76a.jpg"><br>  The most modest device for the price of all that we considered in terms of luxurious life.  But it does not make it any less interesting.  The English manufacturer of luxury cases and suitcases, the company <b>LiveLuggage</b> , not so long ago presented to the public a suitcase that rolls itself.  The engine is powered by an external battery that charges from a simple network. <br><br>  When you are on the road, and indiscreet belongings are packed into this self-propelled device - the last thing you are ready to face is a discharged battery.  But according to the manufacturer, and they can be trusted, the suitcase will ride for you 2 hours without stopping, or almost 3 km.  And if the area to be overcome is similar to the flat only from a distance - the suitcase will not only roll itself uphill, but also charge the battery on descents in the same way that it works in hybrid cars. <br><br>  13. <a href="http://highimpactpc.com/">HighImpactPC PS3 Supercomputer</a> - 1-teraflops computer for the rich and famous, <b>$ 27,220</b> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/831/381/6a2/8313816a2414bedaa2ef7dfa4c387457.jpg"><br>  So we got to one of the most interesting exhibits.  Frankly, before I came across the products of <b>HighImpactPC,</b> I had no idea how much extreme computer solutions are now for home and work.  It turns out - not so much. <br><br>  The <b>PS3 Supercomputer</b> cluster (not to be confused with the PlayStation 3), theoretically producing 1 TFlops (1 trillion floating point operations per second), costs "some" twenty-seven thousand dollars.  But such a computer, after all, will come in handy rather for solving some specialized high-load tasks, but is there something for us, ordinary users?  There is. <br><br>  The company also produces high-power stations for gamers, which are much cheaper.  For example, a system with 8 GB of RAM, a video system (SLI) of two Nvidia GeForce 1 GB cards, 1.5 terabytes of hard disk and two 25-inch monitors will cost $ 7,580. It‚Äôs a pity that in a year it will all be twice as cheap . <br><br>  14. <a href="http://www.iconaircraft.com/">Icon A5 Personal Aircraft</a> - air taxi, <b>$ 139,000</b> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1cb/e53/745/1cbe537452f1ff40aae913f89bc1db28.jpg"><br>  About this quirk for rich lovers of open air, I once wrote today, once again, it is included in the list of desirable devices.  <b>Icon A5</b> is a two-seater sports aircraft aimed at the widest buyer.  It is easy to control them, it lands both on land and on water, which makes it a practically universal means of transportation at a relatively low price (for an airplane). <br><br>  The kid is made of carbon fiber, and therefore very light.  The place of the engine honorably takes 100-strong Rotax 912 ULS, working on jet fuel and conventional gasoline.  The wings of the aircraft are folded, which means that it can be stored even in the garage or transported on a trailer. <br><br>  What to say about the various devices to improve security.  Here and protection of the propeller, indicators of the angle of attack on the wings and even a huge parachute in case something went wrong.  Icon A5 will be put into production in 2010, so there is still some time left to raise money and be among the first, happy customers. <br><br>  15. <a href="http://www.itechnews.net/2008/04/22/solo-solar-powered-table-that-charges-your-gadgets/">Solo Solar Table</a> - ergonomics, coupled with new technologies, <b>$ 14,000</b> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1aa/ab2/1a9/1aaab21a9c78f6f20b77895517dcbfd7.jpg"><br>  This high-tech worktop: <b>SOLo Lounge Table</b> , manufactured by iF, combines ergonomics, the functionality of a solar battery and a minimalist design, not whimsical to a luxurious setting. <br>  Using bluetooth table collects, allows you to exchange and shows all the information from the devices in the field of reach on the tabletop, in combination - LCD display.  In addition to bluetooth, Wi-Fi is also built into the table, which will help to make it an intermediary between computers in the house. <br><br>  This miracle of green technology also allows you to charge up to three portable devices via USB ports without wasting electricity.  Silicon ‚Äúcells‚Äù of the solar battery producing 17+ kilowatts of clean energy are ‚Äúscattered‚Äù over the entire surface of the table top.  And in the evening, the external lighting SOLo will allocate it from tons of inconspicuous furniture and create a pleasant, intimate, atmosphere. <br><br>  16. <a href="http://www.wisdomaudio.com/products_grande.php">The Infinite Wisdom Grande Speaker System</a> - the highest possible twist, <b>$ 70,000</b> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5a2/3d9/9a8/5a23d99a822ef838e1f3d709140905ab.jpg"><br>  <b>The Infinite Wisdom Grande is</b> not like any music system that has ever been produced.  It has always been considered too large and impermissibly luxurious for small apartments;  No, this can be set only in the palace or castle.  On the greatness and status of the company producing The Infinite Wisdom, says that it is the largest supplier of its systems to royal families and presidents. <br><br>  These speakers achieve a high sound pressure of 120 dB in a relaxed manner and with a unique quality.  When the volume is below 110 dB, each speaker automatically selects the required level of sound frequency - from the side it all seems like a real magic, but the quality and quantity in this music system develops into the purest art. <br><br>  However, it is simply impossible to buy such a system for listening to the radio or a new album of Russian pop music, and it is unlikely that it will be sold to a person who does not have an authoritative name, at least in narrow circles.  It makes sense to give $ 70,000 worth only if your musical preferences do not tolerate anything worse.  And you better believe, you will hardly find it. <br><br>  Original in Russian: <a href="http://dvice.ru/tags/%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2588%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F%2B%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D1%258C">Dvice.ru</a> <br>  <a href="http://thehottestgadgets.com/2008/09/17-extremely-expensive-gadgets-to-fit-the-luxurious-lifestyle-001383">thehottestgadgets.com</a> via <a href="http://digg.com/">Digg.com</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/39259/">https://habr.com/ru/post/39259/</a></p>
