There is no prepayment, it is a principle that we adhere while  Our commission is slightly lower than direct competitors, but slightly higher than noname mortgage brokers. <br><br>  <strong>How many banks are in your company portfolio?</strong> <br>  20, but this is a formal figure.  Since we take the commission from the client, and the commission from the bank is indifferent to us, there are no restrictions on banks where we can help get a loan. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <strong>What does a mortgage broker offer clients?</strong>  <strong>What is the responsibility of the broker to the client?</strong> <br>  Our clients are divided into two parts - one needs better rates than they can find on their own, while others need us to help them get a loan even on what conditions.  I repeat, we do not take an advance payment, and we receive the entire commission only in the case of a result that suits the client - this is a guarantee, this is responsibility for the result. <br><br>  <strong>What segments of housing are mortgage brokers mainly engaged in? ..</strong> <br>  Secondary and primary.  But there is no particular mortgage specifics, just the proportion of suburban real estate in the real estate market is objectively less. <br><br>  <strong>What should be the commission system in order for mortgage brokerage to be as objective and independent as possible? ..</strong> <br>  Definitely, all, or significantly, most of the commission should go from the client.  After all, banks pay different amounts of remuneration, and if a broker focuses business on banks, then sooner or later it will be tempting to send them to where they pay more.  And the ‚Äúfree for the client‚Äù service will come out sideways to the same client.  Who pays - that interests and protect. <br><br>  <strong>How effective, in your opinion, is combining a real estate business with a brokerage?</strong> <br>  I, from the moment of the creation of the first mortgage broker in Russia, tried to get away from the realtor component, but, as a result, I had to leave the search for an apartment as a possible additional service.  Including because the qualification of many realtors is not very good and it is better to do everything yourself.  But this service is not imposed, which distinguishes normal mortgage brokers from mortgage realtors.  However, I know mortgage brokers who receive the lion's share of income from this ‚Äúadditional services‚Äù, and not from the mortgage itself. <br><br>  <strong>Is there a system of interaction between the mortgage broker and the state?</strong>  <strong>How effective is it?</strong> <br>  Oh.  What for?  Rather, the main thing that the state does not interfere.  The mortgage brokerage / brokerage market is still very young and underdeveloped.  We, in the Mortgage Brokers Club, have a large number of regional representatives, so in the regions, consumers have almost no complete understanding of the service. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/8173/">https://habr.com/ru/post/8173/</a></p>
