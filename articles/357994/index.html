Thus, the pressure on Amazon is not yet successful; it is <a href="https://geektimes.com/post/300341/">unprofitable for</a> Amazon <a href="https://geektimes.com/post/300341/">to redo its system for the requests of Roskomnadzor</a> .  Probably, blocking millions of AWS addresses will continue in the near future.  The damage for Russian companies until the end of 2018 <a href="https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3614069">is estimated at $ 1 billion</a> .  Amazon and Google will lose about the same amount.  The winners are Rostelecom, Mail.ru Group, Yandex and Microsoft.

      Unlike Amazon, Google went on the negotiations: ‚ÄúOn the contrary, interaction with Google is becoming more constructive, a substantive dialogue has begun,‚Äù said Subbotin. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A meeting with representatives of the IT industry was organized jointly with ROCIT, and Roskomnadzor officials said that now ROCIT will partially take on interaction with users in the framework of considering appeals.  46 thousand calls have already been received to the Roskomnadzor hotline, and 2.9 thousand to the ROCIT line. <br><br><h1>  Point locks </h1><br>  The last couple of days Roskomnadzor moved to the point block IP-addresses.  According to the testimony of the telegram-bot <a href="https://t.me/rknshowtime">RKNSHOWTIME</a> , from April 24, the register of prohibited resources in each upload will be updated to a maximum of a couple of dozen IP addresses.  Moreover, several Google IP addresses have even been removed from the registry (possibly, within the framework of the ‚Äúsubject dialogue‚Äù mentioned by Vadim Subbotin. <br><br>  Among point additions to the registry, there is only one major subnet lock 47.91.64.0/19, which is owned by ALICLOUD-GM ALICLOUD-GM (NET-47-91-64-0-1).  This lock took place today. <br><br>  Thus, the total number of blocked IP addresses now amounts to 17,974,281 (0.485% of the IPv4 address space) and practically does not grow. <br><br>  But the current volume is impressive.  Habrayuzer Dmitry Moskin ( <a href="https://geektimes.com/users/darkbyte/" class="user_link">DarkByte</a> ) did some work.  From the available list of 223 million domains, he calculated the number of blocked domains ( <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oYILvIPzt72gEO5Cq8rhY0j7F_KNry-ya9iAh9Lk3EU/edit">table</a> ), which are resolved to blocked IP addresses.  It turned out <b>about 5.5 million domains in 869 domain zones</b> .  Some domain zones suffered particularly badly: up to 57% of existing domains in these zones are not available from Russia. <br><br>  140 565 domains (2.50% of the total number) are blocked from the .ru zone, 6565 domains from the .xn ‚Äî p1ai (.) zone (0.92% of the total number) are blocked. <br><br>  On the page <a href="https://xn--80aqc2a.xn--p1ai/%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0">ayri.rf</a> you can check the availability of any site from within the Russian Federation according to Roskomnadzor lists. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bz/pn/wa/bzpnwaapoawzgyaneui8ud2exqa.png"><br><br><h1>  Is there a "degradation" of Telegram? </h1><br>  Some users have reported problems with the messenger.  Someone does not load pictures, others do not have voice communication.  There are reports that the program has started to slow down as a whole.  But statistics on the total coverage and the number of posts in the Russian-language telegram channels does not show a special decline.  According to Telegram Analytics, in the period of April 1‚Äì24, 2018, the total coverage ranged from 140 to 210 million views, depending on the day of the week.  The number of posts is also not too changed. <br><br>  Apparently, Roskomnadzor can not effectively block the messenger.  Some officials have openly expressed doubt that the regulator will cope with this task: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how these decisions were made, which experts served this topic, I sincerely wish Roskomnadzor, since there is a court decision to succeed.  But I don‚Äôt really believe that this will happen [that the Telegram will be blocked], ‚Äù <a href="http://www.interfax.ru/russia/610161">said</a> Igor Artemyev, head of the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) of Russia, <a href="http://www.interfax.ru/russia/610161">expressing</a> his opinion. <br><br>  Today, the information and analytical company Medialogia distributed <a href="http://www.mlg.ru/ratings/socmedia/telegram/5939/">information</a> that by April 23 the number of views in Telegram decreased by 76.5% compared to the day the blocking began on April 16, and the top 100 channels lost 23%.  For the most part, the audience allegedly lost entertainment channels dedicated to music, humor, travel, hobbies.  During the study period, the number of views compared to the day the blocking began decreased from 30 to 50%, the news channels suffered less (falling to 25%).  Medialogia has been operating in the market since 2003, and includes past and current users of the press services of public commercial organizations and government agencies, including <a href="https://roem.ru/16-09-2016/233017/otkaz-ot-medialogii-katyusha/">the presidential administration and the government</a> . <br><br>  At the same time, the All-Russian Public Opinion Research Center (VTsIOM) <a href="https://wciom.ru/index.php%3Fid%3D236%26uid%3D9062">published the</a> results of a sociological research.  According to the survey, Telegram occupies one of the last places among popular messengers: only 12% of Internet users use it.  Two thirds of the respondents said that "the issue of the availability of a Telegram in Russia is not important to them."  True, the numbers are changing dramatically for users aged 18-24. <br><br>  <b>In general, is it important or not important for you that Telegram remain accessible to Russian users?</b>  <b>(closed question, one answer,% of the answers of Internet users)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dy/oq/_v/dyoq_v9wgs20bo_rdmeudkb82am.png"><br><br>  Igor Artemyev from FAS criticized colleagues from Roskomnadzor: ‚ÄúIn general, if you do, you must do it to the end [to block Telegram].  We must be sure a thousand times, consult with experts and go to the end.  The state can not afford to sit in a puddle, and it is very sad ... I just see that this story itself, its course causes great damage.  I can say that I am very upset, I see how the younger generation reacts to this, it‚Äôs just terrible, ‚Äùhe added. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Note:</b> When commenting on this material, please follow the rules of Geektimes.
