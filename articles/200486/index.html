In addition, most likely, these same people will be engaged in ‚Äúfiltering‚Äù foreign games, on the subject of Russophobia (did they really take it up and by what criteria do they know the Minister of Culture for games with ‚Äúbad Russians‚Äù?  Interestingly, the whole mess began after a review of the game Company of Heroes 2. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/2m4SCUaBHS8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgmHFaT5oj23klzU5HW65PK9JQFRQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  This review was even shown on Channel One: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/3wbYgm5srao&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgQo6rVdRMIq3NEHMeg_ErDnh0Rzw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

      By the way, the game itself is not so terrible in reality: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/8VpA7dH5h-4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgdchLU2Ivs-ZnEARzDGKVVRjG0Bw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  But the matter is done and satisfied <s>marginal</s> employees of the Ministry of Culture, with the assistance of the Ministry of Defense, took over Igroprom.  In this regard, many have questions, how will this happen?  I tried to suggest, in my opinion, an adequate way to make patriotic games, in my letter, which I sent to the Ministry of Defense (with the Ministry of Culture, after the films of Mikhalkov, I don‚Äôt want to talk in principle).  Here is the text of the letter: <br><br>  ‚ÄúHello, a programmer is writing to you.  I was reached by the news that the Russian Military Historical Society (RVIO), headed by the Minister of Culture Vladimir Medinsky, will be engaged in the development of patriotic computer games.  I ask you to take this idea seriously, since the gaming industry is rapidly developing and among the young people it has long overtaken the film industry and other ‚Äúclassical‚Äù means of influencing the fragile adolescent mind.  I have a number of questions that must have come up for you. <br><br><h5>  Who will be involved in game development? </h5><br>  I draw your attention to the fact that earlier the Ministry of Culture sponsored various films, such as the film ‚ÄúA Man from Capuchin Boulevard‚Äù (2009), the film budget amounted to 108 million rubles and the film was timed to coincide with the 100th anniversary of cinema in Russia.  User evaluation of the film, on the site kinopoisk.ru amounted to 1.725 points, on a 10-point scale, against 8.1 which scored the original - "Man from Capuchin Boulevard", filmed in 1987.  And this example is just one of the brightest.  I do not venture to judge the competence of the Ministry of Culture, but I think it would be a good idea to give the masses the right to choose which mass culture they will spend the budget money to which they are directly related by taxes.  The essence of my idea is to organize a tender for the development of a game, similar to tenders for the purchase of weapons.  The competition should involve large Russian companies that have already shown themselves in the market of computer games.  I draw your attention to some of them: <br><br><ul><li>  Nival Interactive, the author of such games as Blitzkrieg </li><li>  "Buka", created the game series "Petka" </li><li>  Xbow Software, creator of the Star Wolves series of games </li></ul><br><br>  These and other companies could develop a game concept that meets both the requirements of a high-quality digital product and the wishes of the Ministry of Defense in educating the patriotic spirit of young people.  Contestants must prepare a presentation of their project, in which they will tell the story and idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe game, as well as the genre and key features.  The decision about which idea is the most successful should be decided by the players themselves, by voting (this will already create the initial advertisement for the project), for example, on the website of the Ministry of Defense, in the multimedia section (it will be necessary to create a protection against cheating votes).  And in order that the creator did not have the desire to simply spend money, in case of failure in sales and low user ratings, the studio developer should be fined the amount allocated to them from the budget. <br><br><h5>  How will help be provided in creating games? </h5><br>  Apart from the fact that money can be allocated for the project, this is not the only opportunity for the Ministry of Defense to participate in the creation of games and in my opinion is not the most important one.  Feasible help to developers can be, for example, an accurate description of the events that will be covered in the game.  Valid details of various operations, battles, principles of action of military units, with the aim of achieving realism in the game.  Another way to assist can be the recording of shooting sounds, explosions, military equipment at landfills, for reliable audio accompaniment.  Advertising, since the level of support is federal and the advertising of the game can be placed wherever it is necessary for the best perception of the adolescent, age group (this is the task of marketing specialists).  If the product will be a commercial success, the costs of the state and the developer contractor will pay off and even bring profit. <br><br>  In conclusion, I would like to wish not to overdo it with the desire to achieve the goal, as this is primarily a game aimed at entertainment and if it really is like that, then the effect on the players will be a result of its popularity, as well as pride in the domestic gaming industry and the armed forces of the Russian Federation, which will take part in the development. " <br><br><h5>  Total </h5><br>  I do not even know what answer I expect from the Ministry of Defense, it will just be unpleasant if once again, greedy officials and incompetent creators will ruin domestic products using budget money. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/200486/">https://habr.com/ru/post/200486/</a></p>
