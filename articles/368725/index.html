For example, more than 5 million people already have Google Cardboard, cardboard glasses for immersion into virtual reality using a mobile phone.  Virtual reality computer helmets are still only in pre-order mode, but it is known that Oculus Rift pre-ordered 350,000 people, and HTC Vive pre-ordered 15,000 only in the first 10 minutes after opening pre-orders.  How many at the moment they are decorated can only guess.  But this is all data on the world, but <b>what is going on in the market of virtual reality in Russia</b> ?  That's just about it in the video about the development of domestic virtual reality, and under the cut detailed decoding for those who do not like to watch the video. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZYcNMfbbVbo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi0CpCQU7PKuvjdH-Oh46A2qahX_w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Roman Povolotsky</b> (well-known producer of the gaming industry), <b>Oleg Yusupov</b> (organizer of the event on augmented and virtual reality ‚ÄúMixAR‚Äù), <b>Maxim Chizhov</b> (co-founder of the virtual reality club Virtuality Club) and me speak about the development and popularization of virtual reality technologies in Russia. <br><br>  <b>We first discuss what is now virtual reality in Russia from the point of view of the gaming industry.</b> <br><br>  Now it‚Äôs all more like a kind of creative phase, when all companies that have a successful product operating and are actively looking at this niche, because everyone understands that it will develop in the next 5 years at least, and then most likely, in for 15-20 years steady growth.  And, in principle, everyone understands this, as well as the fact that there is no platform as such, that is, now there are some attempts to create the VR industry and now every producer in the gaming industry is thinking about what project he would like to do.  Now, this is the main energy-intensive process in which this controller is realized, just as Apple once released its iPhone, and we saw a new technology platform on which to make games that were previously impossible to do.  Instead of a mouse pad, we got the touchscreen mechanism and it really changed the games altogether.  Now we already see a huge number of options for the implementation of gaming products with the help of gesture control.  And the same thing is happening now with the VR market, everyone is actively watching and trying to understand the adaptation of their own products, or come up with some new projects.  There are companies that have already begun to budget development.  In the next 3 years, no one expects a huge number of devices at home, but, nevertheless, by the time of popularization of the gadget everyone wants to have in their hands the content that will make money.  Therefore, now everyone is in this state of research "R &amp; D", everyone is researching and developing.  At least those who have the money for it. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2fa/5ce/884/2fa5ce8844e64d999062002aa9575290.png"></div><br><br>  For example, the company 2RealLife is engaged in the study of this area, Nekki is studying, Mail.ru is also actively looking in this direction.  There is a strong opinion that almost all gaming companies are interested in being present in this fast-growing market.  It looks like the same thing as the first mobile phone, its first sales became the organic driver of the content that was presented and this phenomenon was noticed and studied by everyone.  Everyone is expecting about the same thing in VR, and everyone wants to make some kind of gaming product that will reveal these technological features of this platform and win the hearts of fans and be among those pioneers who, in fact, conquer this world.  Well and, moreover, the very word ‚Äúvirtual reality‚Äù has a very big sense - it is a whole reality and one should understand that when a person puts this helmet on his head, he first of all wants to see some new experience, which, most likely, will be associated with some kind of exploration, when you can interact with this space.  You will see something new, something that you have never seen before, and this will definitely form a completely new industry.  There was a platform - a personal computer, then a console, she used a TV - also a two-dimensional image, then a gaming platform appeared in the browser - this is a huge amount of web games, then a social platform, it is still in two-dimensional space.  Then a smartphone appeared, then a tablet appeared and all this time we talked about a two-dimensional representation, and now we are talking about a three-dimensional representation and people who are engaged in the production of graphics and animation, they certainly expect an explosive growth of all this, because one thing you are doing two-dimensional the reality that will be expressed in the smartphone is another matter entirely - as a gaming company you will have to create an atmosphere in which the user will dive.  This will definitely mean some excessive demands on the graphics, excessive demands on animation, reflex, feedback from the playing space.  It even touches the sound, not to mention some tactile gadgets, which in the case of smartphones and tablets do not make any sense.  Unless I saw startup which allows to twitch to the device in case of receiving damage.  This is the maximum that was.  Here we are talking about total immersion and, most likely, all our senses will be involved technologically and we will probably see something about which even now it‚Äôs too early to dream, because now we see the very very beginning and this is great. <br><br>  <b>Then about the popularization of technology in Russia</b> <br><br>  We divide popularization into several options.  First, this is the creation of events, online meetings, podcasts, TV shows, content, analytics.  Unfortunately, there is no analytics of the Russian market.  But there is everything else.  More in <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/262536/">this</a> article. <br><br>  From the point of view of events, conferences are being made, for example, ‚ÄúMixAR‚Äù - a free conference that brought together 3,000 people in 2015.  The next will be in September 2016. 40 companies took part in the conference, including world leaders, Wikitude is one of the leaders of mobile augmented reality, AREA is an alliance for the introduction of system augmented reality into the industry.  Our general partner and technology vendor, Microsoft and Intel.  At the conference there were 27 exhibiting companies: startups and digital studios, large companies and vendors, and there were also three dive floors. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/17e/0aa/204/17e0aa204b7a4e40b8d77e260b6ee6f9.jpg"></div><br><br>  Events for virtual reality users are being made, the nearest will be June 24, 25, 26 - the huge game festival "CyberMoscow" with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãdedicated virtual reality - and Roman Povolotsky is involved in its organization.  He says, ‚Äú <i>We immediately focus on the fact that it is consumer‚Äôs and we‚Äôre approaching this a bit from the other side. Game companies are now, first of all, studying user experience and exploring the creative part that will allow content to be done in a form that It will be a success. That is, here‚Äôs how Angry Birds once revealed some of the functions of the iPhone, as well as gaming companies, producers of gaming companies, including myself, are researching: what type of genres, what settings, what games mechanics, what economic</i>  <i>and business models to use? Going back to the festival's theme, of course, we will do a large VR section there, it will not be the only one, we will have a rather serious focus on eSports, and we want to separately focus on the educational part, because a large number people are suffering now, because they want to play games, but they don‚Äôt know how, and I think everyone understands that in the next 5-10 years there will be only growth in the labor market in this direction and artists and programmers will be in demand.</i>  <i>Attitude to the games from the cinema, about the same as it was in 1910 at the theater in relation to the cinema.</i>  <i>That is, in principle, everyone understands that now the gaming industry is already more capitalized than the cinema, but nevertheless there are still some residual processes that should come to naught by themselves.</i>  <i>But I think that few people are already watching TV, since 10 years ago, and if there is free time, a person already picks up a smartphone: he sat on Facebook, read, sat on Instagram, and then actually went to play.</i>  <i>And we, of course, study all these processes, because everyone understands that in the near future there will be only a growing trend in the number of involved users and in the amount of money involved in this industry.</i>  <i>And especially for this, we have developed the concept of our festival, which consists on the one hand in de-templateing the image of a gamer who is a teenager with bruises under his eyes.</i>  <i>This is certainly not the case, colossal momentum.</i>  <i>Hundreds of millions of dollars - turns in eSports.</i>  <i>The same goes for VR, we want to look very carefully at how users react.</i>  <i>We want to get exactly the consumer feedback and see which genres, which settings will enjoy success.</i>  <i>We want to complete this section as closely as possible, so that all possible variants of what is now on the market are presented and somehow we will try to systematize it.</i>  <i>We want to become a tote of this process, in which we will get a segmentation at the output and see how consumer measures react to it.</i>  <i>And of course, we will make a consolidated analytical article on this topic and will be more clearly oriented in this environment.</i>  <i>And of course, we are waiting for all the listeners.</i>  <i>The event is planned in Sokolniki Park in the second pavilion.</i>  <i>The event will take 3 days and all three days there will be a very interesting program.</i>  <i>Such kind of events are catalysts, it doesn't matter, it is B2B or B2C, but we also want to become a catalyst for this process.</i>  <i>And of course, for my part, I can add that the business environment is very actively preparing for this.</i>  <i>If we are already talking about a professional topic, now all of this is in the phase of preproduction and prototyping, when no one expects income.</i>  <i>Everyone understands that the platform is not yet represented at home, no one has an understanding of how it will look like in 5 years, so now we are in the creative phase, when this is an absolutely wild market and everything is possible.</i>  <i>Therefore, it is such a fruit that attracts the attention of a huge number of people.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>We have our own hypotheses about this.</i>  <i>The big difference between the tablet and virtual reality and, above all, the difference in the pattern of interaction with this device.</i>  <i>If we take a smartphone in hand, then we expect something, but at the same time we do not cease communicating with people around us, we do not fall out of the surrounding space.</i>  <i>In the case of virtual reality, it is assumed that we completely fall out.</i>  <i>My colleagues and I talked a lot on this topic and came to the conclusion that, probably, first of all, we are talking about some kind of self-isolation from the surrounding space, which will be provoked either by airplanes, when I sit and work closely with some person which also, God forbid, smells unpleasant somehow.</i>  <i>In general, you understand, isolation into virtual reality will be stimulated first of all, by some kind of environment.</i>  <i>We see it in airplanes, we see it in cars.</i>  <i>In the near future we will see absolutely automated means of delivering us from point A to point B, we will already be free enough to allow half an hour, and someone an hour to be able to plunge into space.</i>  <i>someone will do it, of course, from home.</i>  <i>But, most likely, the primary mass pattern, most likely, will be in this kind of cars, when looking at the same picture is constantly no longer interesting, but getting some kind of new experience in the process of movement will most likely be very cool.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>With regard to everything else, I look at it very skeptically, because it‚Äôs more like some kind of rodeo, and it‚Äôs probably more like some unique experience that we want to get.</i>  <i>We come to the cinema, we are interested to see something new that we have never seen before.</i>  <i>Here, too, this is the same thing, as I see it, the main problem of VR.</i>  <i>The fact that I do not want to go back there.</i>  <i>That is, you put on a helmet that went through 100 people, you have some not very pleasant feelings from the fact that it is not very clean and not very hygienic.</i>  <i>In addition, the picture is not very high quality, all this is clear, but, nevertheless, everyone is actively looking at it and we including.</i>  <i>From a business point of view, probably, any large company is now ready to orient the budget, therefore, I recommend to listeners to believe in themselves, to believe that the content that they are preparing now will definitely find its user and just need to think about the technological properties of the platform and try to create some kind of experience that will allow you to return with interest.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>My personal opinion is that when we talk about virtual reality, we assume that this is still reality, these are some objects with which I can interact interactively and thus study this new reality, study this new space. .</i>  <i>It is possible, to deform it, perhaps to leave traces there, it is possible to communicate in this space with our colleagues or with colleagues within the framework of some production facilities, so that we work in an alternative creative zone, in which it is possible to do all this faster.</i>  <i>From the point of view of operation, of course, everyone is interested in looking at the service part - this is what Oleg and I discussed.</i>  <i>That is, unlike the smartphone, which is the point of access to the Internet - it is the Internet in your pocket and it is clear why he enjoys such success, because he understands the service model.</i>  <i>In the case of VR, there is no such model; moreover, in fact, not everyone is comfortable wearing it, it is also unclear why.</i>  <i>And I recommend to pay attention to the service part and think about how to simplify a person‚Äôs life.</i>  <i>In this case, the games are still in the second echelon, and in the first one there is an architecture, objects of art that will allow you to quickly create in this space and effectively interact in it.</i>  " <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3be/284/4e5/3be2844e5991479f9f52590b5b2864d7.png"></div><br><br>  <b>We also talked about developments and Russian developers in the field of virtual reality.</b> <br><br>  So far, everyone is looking for content and everyone is in the creative phase and in the prototyping phase, when any content is a prototype, that is, there is no product line, as is the case with smartphones, so you can sell anything, the main thing is to understand that you sell, for whom and how it will be consumed. <br><br>  The most effective way to develop is to make entertainment, some kind of entertainment, because they will be the drivers of this process, after which everyone else will understand how all this will exist.  Developers can now be advised to create a technical demo for their content, create it as high-quality as possible, make a presentation and search for money so that the whole thing develops.  Someone finds it in his family, someone finds it in the publishers, someone finds it with his friends, how it usually happens in life: we find like-minded people, we begin to unite with them.  And in fact, companies that are willing to invest in this huge amount.  This and all kinds of specialized funds, that is, game publishers who are interested in the primary participation and, in fact, the company developers are looking for options, because everyone understands that in the case of some kind of explosive growth, it would be good to have content that will be presented. <br><br>  As for personnel and work in the field of VR, there is a strong opinion that there will be an explosive growth in three-dimensional specializations associated with the visualization of the space itself.  The space is assumed to be three-dimensional and, as a result, the resulting professions associated with 3D, with animation, processing, programming of the client part, which will visualize the whole thing qualitatively and be able to optimize these processes, because now the technology is clearly raw, the capacities are weak, the picture quality is weak.  Therefore, the main forces will be thrown into the picture and into the emotional return. <br><br>  Here is a squeeze out of talking about virtual reality in Russia with market experts.  Write and your vision on the development of this technology in our country, we will discuss! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368725/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368725/</a></p>
