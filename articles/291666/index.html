  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Work of the future</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, most of the work looks like this: there is a certain business person who owns a business who hires people to delegate to them certain types of activities. <br>  The goal of the businessman is to make money on a car / house / yacht / island, etc.  depending on the ambition. <br>  The employees hired are screws in the mechanism, the creator of the mechanism is not very interested in having the screws think of themselves as businessmen, so they try not to overload anyone with information about all the intricacies of the business (some kind of divide and conquer principle). <br><blockquote>  The golden rule of governance: There is always one person in every company <br>  who understands what's really going on, that's what you need <br>  lay off first. </blockquote><br>  Motivated by these employees with the money necessary for survival, Marx called it alienated labor. <br>  There are certainly exceptions that look like aliens or messengers from the future. <a name="habracut"></a>  , we constantly read about the largest / most famous of them on all types of habr.  This is for example, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve">Valve</a> , whose <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/142645/">corporate culture is very unusual</a> because it allows you to do anything;  Project eMT - people <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/2170/">work 4 days a week remotely</a> and without prodding;  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix">Netflix</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Group">Virgin</a> who <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/2186/">do not follow the schedule of work and rest of employees</a> ;  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/37signals">37signals</a> - who wrote a whole book about their work style (Rework);  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google">Google</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon.com">Amazon</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify">Spotify</a> probably also fall into this list, like many others ( <a href="https://dev.by/lenta/main/belorusskiy-programmist-v-spotify">you can read</a> about the work of the latter <a href="https://dev.by/lenta/main/belorusskiy-programmist-v-spotify">here</a> ). <br>  What is the main difference between the approach of such companies?  - The fact that they <b>do not</b> consider the employee stupid, lazy and irresponsible, everything else follows from this. <br>  Since an employee is smart, hard-working and responsible, then there is no need to monitor whether he is working, or to indicate how to work, and in many cases you do not even need to specify what to do. <br>  Someone will say that there is not enough of all such workers, that these companies simply absorb one apparently small percentage of smart, hard-working and responsible people, this is partly true.  But the fact is that in my opinion a significant part of people just adapts to the way the work is organized now - they do not impose responsibility on it supported by authority, they lose responsibility (arguing: ‚Äúif they don‚Äôt trust me, let them worry themselves‚Äù).  Plus, we must understand that if a person works poorly, then maybe he is simply not in his place. <br>  Companies of the old type do not want to change, but I suspect that life will make either change or die out. <br><br>  I believe that in the not-so-distant future, the inanimate executors of the will of the great chief will no longer be needed, primarily in connection with robotization.  A huge number of professions will disappear very soon because  robots will take the place of people.  Moreover, companies built on the old principles will simply lose the competition not only for personnel, but also for markets, because  A significant proportion of their energy goes to "management" and "motivation." <br>  The new approach is not only humane, but also logically more efficient - for example, Stafford Beer‚Äôs cybernetics book ‚ÄúThe Brain of a Firm‚Äù states that a system of lesser complexity (brain, director of a company) cannot control all the details of systems of greater complexity (body, firm), which means that the flow of information to the control system having given some autonomy to the subsystems, this is what advanced employers do. <br><br>  What to do with those who can not work independently?  Probably from humane considerations they will not be converted into biogas, but most likely they will join the army of the unemployed or just the army (although there are robots). </div>
