Updated program. </h4><br>  We are pleased to announce the next set of "Corporate penetration testing laboratories".  The new program, in addition to the updated and the most relevant theoretical and practical material, will include a unique material of the tariff ‚ÄúExpert‚Äù, in which we collected ‚Äúhardcord‚Äù practices of pentest and counter attackers - the material of the level of professional conferences on practical security. <br>  In addition to the unique curriculum and teaching methods, the additional benefits of the Corporate Labs program are <b>fully distance learning</b> and <b>flexible schedule</b> , which allows you to keep on working. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  <b>Learning process</b> </h5><br>  For comfortable and high-quality training, we abandoned third-party solutions and developed our own platform for distance learning, which includes the Personal Account, the Platform for webinars, and the Specialized Laboratories.  Training takes place in groups of 10-15 people.  Each group is assigned a curator, who controls the entire learning process.  If the curator notices difficulties in passing the lab or in completing the assignment, he will immediately offer the student his help.  Despite this approach, the curator always tries to give an opportunity to independently cope with the task, accompanying the training with small hints. <br><br><h5>  <b>Theoretical training</b> </h5>  As before, theoretical training consists of online courses (webinars), in which experienced instructors from PENTESTIT will share their knowledge with students.  The instructors include experts in the field of practical information security with long-term experience, key speakers from international forums, authors of numerous articles on Habr√©: Luka (@exitusletaris) Safonov, Ares (@Intercepter), Alexander (@ sinist3r) Dmitrenko, Vladimir Korennoy and others.  As always, theoretical training makes up 20-30% of training and is an integral part of it. <br><br><h5>  <b>Program guests</b> </h5>  In addition to the speeches of our colleagues, we have recently started to invite outside experts from the IT and IB world as guests of the program.  Such stars as Grigory Zemskov (Revision), Oleg Mikhaylsky (Acronis), Maxim Lagutin (SiteSecure) and Oleg Bondarenko (Qrator Labs) have already performed at Corporate Labs.  <b>Sergey Rebz</b> (@rebz), antichat.ru moderator, rebz.net manager (audit.antichat.ru) will be speaking in the upcoming KL series.  The participants of the new set will be able to talk and ask Sergey their questions, and later, at the end of the course, we will post the video of Sergey‚Äôs speech to the public.

    <h5>  <b>Practical training</b> </h5>  The main focus of the training in ‚ÄúKL‚Äù is precisely on practical training - a unique one of its kind and a component of 70-80% of training.  All assignments received during the webinar courses are obliged to be fixed in practice under the guidance of an experienced curator.  In addition, the final exam at the end of training is the execution of a pentest of a corporate computer network constructed on the basis of networks of real companies.  Pentest is regulated by time and allows you to make sure that the student has received the knowledge in full. <br><br><h5>  <b>Studying programs</b> </h5>  The training program is divided into modules / tariffs: "Standard", "Profi" and "Expert", each of which is a continuation of the previous one.  Thus, the module "Expert" includes the program "Standard", "Profi", as well as additional hardcore material. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Training programs "KL"</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>"Standard"</b> <br><ul><li>  Legislation in the field of information security in Russia and abroad; </li><li>  Penetration testing (methods; views; toolkit); </li><li>  Network security (scanning; configuration errors; exploitation; post-exploitation); </li><li>  Web security (the nature of SQL injection; XSS basics; an overview of tools for exploiting web vulnerabilities); </li><li>  Building effective information security systems (introductory information; review of existing IDS); </li><li>  Intercepter-NG; </li><li>  Strengthening the skills acquired in practice: CTF-tasks and an examination laboratory.
