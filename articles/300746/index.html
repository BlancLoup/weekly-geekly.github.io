  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why can not open an online store, earn a million and go to Goa</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, the business on the Internet is developing spontaneously and it is quite difficult to predict exactly what awaits you, behind that turn.  Many companies seek to cover new sales channels, or supplement their offline points with online stores, thereby filling the free space in the minds of consumers with their brand. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/4b7/652/7b4/4b76527b417f4c696701e8f8fa239931.jpg" width="223" height="225" align="left" alt="image"><br>  A page on the Internet, with a wide assortment, beautiful photos and necessary information on the product will never be superfluous and not sinful to spend on its development several hundred thousand rubles ... or is it a sin? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The main problem is that many consider the development of an online store the end point of the path.  ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get to it and the golden era will begin, money will flow like a river, customers will start visiting the site, add goods to the basket, orders will pour in and life will get better‚Äù.  Of course, this is one of the extremes, but in the end, this is the way most people see the big picture when they are just planning to enter this business.  Not for nothing, in folklore, which is our legacy, very often the wishes came true ‚Äúby the trick‚Äù, because it is in us at the program level, the desire to achieve major goals, the easy way. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/27a/190/ad5/27a190ad5e6e62a9b2b9437bd921374f.jpg" width="385" height="273" align="right" alt="image"><br>  Business can adhere to the same desires, because  the same people work in it, with the same mentality and common life values.  In most cases, this approach does not work. <br><br>  Imagine that you want to grow a crop.  You purchased seeds, dug a vegetable garden, prepared the soil, soaked it with the necessary amount of substance necessary for growth and sowed the seeds.  After that, they left for half a year and returned, hoping to harvest a chic crop, but instead, you see nothing, it turns out that the seeds did not germinate, due to lack of moisture, inadequate care, and all your efforts went to pieces.

      It would seem, it is clear to everyone that, depending on the seeds we sowed, there are different conditions, the fulfillment of which leads to an increase in yield and a result.  But when it comes to an online store, for some reason, many people surrender precisely at the stage of sowing, when the online store is developed and with it only the real work remains to be done to grow the customer base and promote it.  This may be due to the fact that the company does not have an employee who has to deal with the site and no one simply has time to solve the new task pool.  Or due to the fact that business owners did not get such an effect, because the goal was to create a website and now it is achieved, but we need to work further.  ‚ÄúDo something?  Need more money?  Well, this is disgusting, you see! ‚Äù, Etc.  If at the development stage, it is still possible to allocate time, because the developer constantly reminds and bothers you with requests to do something, do it and walks around the customer every day with an invoice for payment, after the delivery of the project, the online store is completely in charge of its owner and motivation Depends only on himself. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/de1/4a5/4e0/de14a54e0757e1aae48bec625fd2b67b.jpg" width="223" height="225" align="left" alt="image"><br>  And in this case, lack of time, lack of experience, lack of staff, leads to the fact that the site does not develop, does not bring income, suggesting, but was it worth it at all?  Why did we spend N-thousand rubles for its development?  Maybe for our business is not an option?  What do we do now?  And besides this, the person who has to make such decisions has other tasks and he decides to postpone this issue in the back box, because morning is wiser than evening.  In the morning rolls a heap of other problems and issues, the solution of which does not tolerate delay, and so, day after day, the question is constantly in limbo. <br><br>  What to do in this case?  Invest resources further, of course.  After the development of the site, work on it is just beginning, and if there is no time or not enough employees within the company, you need to find sources from the outside.  We need someone who will know everything about the site and understand what and how it works on it, not only in technical terms, but also in the form of communication with the customer base.  Let's call this the person who is the savior of the situation - the site manager. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/299/822/3b1/2998223b1a953980fba0889064e74db0.jpg" width="523" height="271" align="right" alt="image"><br>  Firstly, such an employee will always be able to perform manual work, add a description, add images, maintain up-to-date information about products. <br><br>  Secondly, the manager will be able to fill the site with news content, constantly maintaining a fresh and relevant information environment on the site.  And this means a lot to promote the site, because the unique content favorably affects this, and high positions in search engines will allow people who need products on your subject to be visible. <br><br>  Thirdly, the manager will be able to synchronize the social networks with the online store, figure out how best to share the audience between these two tools and how you can increase customer loyalty. <br><br>  Fourth, use the metric tools to track the bottleneck on the site, which prevents site visitors from converting to customers and eliminating it. <br><br>  Here you can list a lot of other things that you cannot see for yourself, without devoting all your time to the site, or to someone from the outside who is not familiar with the business processes within the company. <br><br>  In fact, the situation can be assessed only by putting some effort and realizing what comes of it.  It‚Äôs not a fact that in the first couple of months the results of the site manager‚Äôs work will be visible, but in this case you need to do at least something.  Try to use different approaches, assess the situation, get feedback from these attempts, analyze the results and change the motion vector.  A journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step and the development of an online store is the first step, but you don‚Äôt need to stop there.  It is hard work that brings investment only after a lot of work and time has been invested. <br><br>  Can I start an online store and go to rest in Goa?  Surely you can.  If you have no competitors or your online store sells oxygen, which is nowhere else to buy and live without it is impossible. <br><br>  In modern reality, the online store looks more like an ungrateful wife.  You married her, spinning around her every day, not getting anything in return, trying to melt the heart of the ice queen.  You do all this because you know that there is a beautiful person under the cold mask, because you love, and you are not trying to fuck with it.  In this case, it is you who is a sacrificing person and practically does not receive anything in return.  It is you who are ready to do everything, even if you are not asked to do this and do not hope to receive dividends, but do all this from the purest motives and love.  You have to love your project so that in the end, you can bring it to the desired state and he answered you in return.  Then you will not think about how to make more money, but you will think how to make it even better, better, bolder.  Something happens, something not.  Like everything else in life, you cannot guess what exactly is waiting for us around that turn. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300746/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300746/</a></p>
