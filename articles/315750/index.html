The most famous example of its use is the bitcoin network.  However, limited information is available in it - the sender of the "coins", their number and the recipient's address. <br><br>  One of the projects that ITMO University staff and students are involved in is using the blockchain and applying technology in another area - the management of drones.  Read more about this in our material. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/spbifmo/blog/315750/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e8/a3b/bb0/7e8a3bbb044b4ce5aef94ed5b0592be7.jpeg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>Christopher Michel / <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/cmichel67/16949130789">Flickr</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC</a></i>

    <h2>  <b>How does the "drone employee"</b> </h2><br>  The project is based on the use of the Ethereum platform.  Its main difference from other electronic money systems is that the internal currency (‚Äúether‚Äù) is not equivalent to coins, but feeds network nodes that work with each other on ‚Äúsmart contracts‚Äù. <br><br>  For example, one node sends "broadcast" to a specific address, and this information is entered into the blockchain.  In response, the other node starts to execute the code.  Thus, it is possible to create a network in which the robots themselves will monitor the correct execution of instructions. <br><br>  After creating an employment contract (for which you need to specify the base coordinates) and transfer the transaction to the Ethereum network, the drone receives the coordinates and calculates the distance and cost of the flight.  Then the user makes the payment, and the robot proceeds to perform the task.  The developers are confident that such a platform can form the basis of the system of interaction between the Internet of things market participants. <br><br>  The ultimate goal of the project is to create a mass service of drones, which will be independently and decentralized controlled by exchanging instructions.  This need is due to the fact that different <a href="http://drone-employee.com/road-map/">participants are</a> involved in the use of drone drone: end users, insurance companies, Internet providers, autonomous drones bases, companies providing topographic data, and so on.  And decentralized management provides a high level of security. <br><br>  The first tests were conducted in 2015.  And in April of this year, the project team represented by Sergey Lonshakov, Assistant of the <a href="http://csi.ifmo.ru/">Department</a> of Management Systems and Informatics of ITMO University Alexander Kapitonov, graduate of ITMO University Alexander Krupenkin and student of ITMO University Semyon Pavlov tested the system for the ability to independently correct routes.  A total of four drone were involved, the routes of which were specially crossed.  The experiment was successful: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8VgqUA30u8s" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Lead project developer Sergey Lonshakov for the first time <a href="http://forklog.com/rukovoditel-proekta-dron-sotrudnik-vystupil-s-lektsiej-o-blokchejne-na-forume-otkrytye-innovatsii/">presented the</a> project to the general public this August at the Drone Expo Show.  And on October 28, the project was included in the interactive session of the V Annual Forum "Open Innovations", which was held in the Skolkovo Technopark.  Sergey noted the growing interest in the use of this technology, which was noticeable by the number of people who were present at the Drona Employee demonstration. <br><br>  Another developer praised the prospects for the project in an interview with the Internet portal ForkLog: ‚ÄúThe business model of this project seems to be extremely viable for 2016‚Äì2018.  Taking into account the fact that the project combines two extremely high-tech and young parties - cryptocurrency technologies using smart contracts and the use of the ROS framework for communicating with the don. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/32e/ffd/531/32effd531177405ca3ffc5db394d458c.jpg"><br>  <i>/ Photo <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/science/cyberphysics/news/5939/">itmo.news</a></i> <br><br>  The activity of the team members is not limited to this, they have experience with other technologies.  For example, Alexander Kapitonov worked in a group of researchers led by the head.  Department of Management Systems and Computer Science at ITMO University Alexey Bobtsov on the implementation of LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT in <a href="http://ntv.ifmo.ru/file/article/355.pdf">teaching</a> students the basics of adaptive management.  The project is educational, includes learning how to engage students in work, and aims to create a productive atmosphere for the development of theoretical aspects of adaptive management. <br><br>  In addition, as part of another group, Alexander developed a system for <a href="http://openbooks.ifmo.ru/ru/article/9376/razrabotka_sistemy_traektornogo_upravleniya_mobilnym_robotom_s_rolikonesuschimi_kolesami.html">controlling</a> mobile robots using a kinematic model.  The team focused on the study of robots with roller bearing wheels due to their maneuverability and tested the developed system in practice. <br><br><h2>  <b>Why the project is "ahead of time"</b> </h2><br>  The project, created on the basis of ITMO University, fits perfectly into the <a href="http://www.nti2035.ru/nti/">concept of the</a> National Technology Initiative.  The NTI is designed taking into account the expected global changes in the technology market and is aimed at developing in Russia a suitable environment for the formation of a sufficient number of highly qualified and interested personnel, the creation of platforms for their training and growth, and the development of new technologies. <br><br>  According to the concept, within 10‚Äì20 years, new large global markets in technology will emerge.  And thanks to the phased implementation of the NTI, Russia can be adequately represented in these markets. <br><br>  The experts identified priority areas of development (they are also the future technological <a href="http://www.nti2035.ru/markets/">markets</a> ), one of them - AeroNet (AeroNet) - suggests the development of unmanned aircraft systems market segments.  The Agency for Strategic Initiatives (STI regulator) developed a roadmap, according to which by 2020 it is planned to ‚Äúdevelop BAS flight technologies in the general airspace together with manned aircraft and technologies to create systems of automatic self-organization of BAS sets‚Äù (see paragraph 1.7. In the table ‚Äù Roadmap implementation plan " <a href="http://www.rvc.ru/nti/roadmaps/dk_aeronet_new.pdf">here</a> ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d76/3a2/8a7/d763a28a796c49b98cd5c0b4705aeec4.png"><br>  <i>/ Image <a href="http://www.asi.ru/nti/">ASI</a></i> <br><br>  Within the framework of the project ‚ÄúDrone-Employee‚Äù, the possibility of organizing the simultaneous flight of several drones without the participation of a person (exactly what is ‚Äúplanned‚Äù for 2020 in the NTI) is already being realized.  Of course, this is only a small part of the concept, which in addition to this item includes the use of UAVs, for example, in orbits and even as a transport.  But the project‚Äôs success shows that NTI can exist not only on paper and create a climate for researchers and developers. <br><br>  The co-author of the NTI project, Dmitry Peskov, in his speech at ITMO University, said that, in his opinion, one of the main technological trends is ‚Äúblockchainization‚Äù, that is, the rejection of intermediaries in all areas, which, in turn, is related to high rate of technology development.  (See ‚ÄúTechnological Singularity and Oldfags‚Äù in the <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/startups_and_business/initiative/news/5739/">source</a> ).  This, perhaps, explains the increased interest in the project "Dron-Employee" - its creators were in the trend and were able to develop technology at the junction of several already popular systems. <br><br><h2>  <b>Who else at ITMO University explores these areas?</b> </h2><br>  At ITMO University, not only Sergei Lonshakov‚Äôs team is involved in the development of UAVs.  For example, the University has developed a modular <a href="http://bpla.ifmo.ru/">platform</a> for building drones of various configurations.  You can choose various options for the layout of the modules, depending on the desired characteristics of the device, in addition, the hardware system is designed to work with domestic components.  The system also includes an onboard computer on Linux OS. <br><br>  An entire team of ITMO University (represented by Alexey Margun, Konstantin Zimenko, Dmitry Bazylev and others) developed an UAV control algorithm based on the feedback linearization method (for more information about the study, read <a href="http://ntv.ifmo.ru/file/article/11190.pdf">here</a> ).  In work two methods of control of the quadcopter with the robotic manipulator are compared.  As a result, on the basis of the constructed models, scientists come to the conclusion that the new method of control proposed by them allows the UAV to follow the given trajectory more clearly and effectively than the classical approach (based on a proportional-differential controller). <br><br>  At ITMO University much attention is paid to blockchain technology as such.  For example, the work of the blockchain based on the Ethereum platform, which was developed by the Russian-Canadian <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2545292">programmer</a> Vitalik Buterin and launched (officially) only about a year ago (the Drone-Employee project works on its basis), this year students of the master's <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/education/cooperation/news/5831/">program</a> can study Mathematical Physics and Information Theory. <br><br>  Another <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/science/it/news/6164/">example of</a> research in this area is the ‚Äúsmart city‚Äù project, in which ITMO University employees work together with the European <a href="http://biotope.cs.hut.fi/">bIOTope</a> project.  A student design bureau (RED) from the department of control systems and computer science, integrates mobile robotic systems into the Ethereum network.  (We already wrote about the activities of this bureau <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/spbifmo/blog/279663/">here</a> ). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/315750/">https://habr.com/ru/post/315750/</a></p>
