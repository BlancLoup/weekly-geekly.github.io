  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tele 2. Is everything so good?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Five and a half years.  The flight is normal.  As I recall, such an article was already on the main Habr.  But I thought negative reviews are written repeatedly, why not thank them twice?  Moreover, tele2 is not so often mentioned here. <br>  Nothing has changed in the time since that post: the ‚Äúnews‚Äù about the big three almost weekly appears and nothing is heard about Tele2, which develops without much noise. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It‚Äôs not for me to tell their story, but it must be filled with interesting events.  It began almost from a local operator: poor coverage even within the city, the almost complete absence of base stations outside of it, in many other cities did not even hear about it.  There were at the beginning and interruptions in communication and congestion of channels.  But all this is the past that I found.  Less than a year, almost all the problems were solved, but these unpleasant facts left a lasting trace in people's memory: you can still hear ‚Äúpoor communication quality and coverage‚Äù in conversation with someone, as an argument against Tele2.  At the moment, the operator provides confident coverage and quality of service anywhere in the city.  Outside the city, the reception area is subjectively worse than, for example, Beeline, but only slightly.  While the big three are making millions for building a base station, Tele2 is engaged in optimizing the existing ones (I will not be cunning: I don‚Äôt know for sure - I am writing from the words of a former employee of the company).  Plus, one after another, new cities appear on the operator‚Äôs map. <br>  Technical support (there was practically no need to deal with it) is quite adequate, 10 minutes to listen to dull melodies a la Dendy is not necessary.  They work promptly and with respect to the client. <br>  Tariffs are among the cheapest (there is an assumption that this is why some people are skeptical about it - they are squeamish about cheapness) for our region.  Rarely offers of other operators are more profitable.  Last fare - 0.5 penny.  The same applies to GPRS / EDGE - 4 ru / MB.  Speed, though not a record, but to read the bash / habr / elements on the way to work and home is enough.  The only thing that upsets is that the WAP settings come by default, however, in this they are neither better nor worse than the others - some kind of remnant of 2003.  And also sad the lack of 3G. <br>  Separately, I want to say about advertising.  I don‚Äôt really like modern PR and advertising of the big three (well, maybe Beeline is an exception) - incredible spending (lyrics, dances, extras - this is just what I know - unenlightened) to promote a new piece, white gloss, perfect world .  Everything is somehow beaten.  MTS in general distinguished itself in the last new year.  In other words, they stuff the price of a worthless service.  Yes.  it's beautiful, but on the exhaust - nonsense.  After rebranding, Tele2, once and for all / for a long time, chose their style, which unites all their advertising - the mafia.  It turns out a beautiful game, for which it is interesting to watch.  Each movie - a small story. <br><br>  Finally, I will say that I am familiar with several Tele2 employees.  From their words, we can conclude that they are not holding idlers and irresponsible.  One of these people is the technical director of the company I work for, the other is my boss.  They can be trusted. <br>  In general, I am pleased with them, like a boa constrictor.  I want to express my gratitude to the Tele2 team and say that, if something changes, it is only for the better! <br>  <b>PS</b> Recht is about the city of Kemerovo, lost in the snows of Siberia. <br>  <b>PPS</b> I do not know whether it is customary to edit the article in the course of the discussion at Habr√©.  But I can not help it: it turns out that the attitude towards the operator is not created by PR, but by the quality of work. <br>  &lt;This post I wanted to show that some may work well, and not that there was a lot of money&gt; </div>
