Today we would like to talk about how a wide range of materials it can print. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/254/601/b8d/254601b8d1864b65ab7029778d3f99d8.jpg"><br><br>  The manufacturer claims that the new printer was immediately designed taking into account the widest possible range of materials (both already available and those that are just in development).  The declared printing temperature is up to 380 degrees, and the printing platform heats up to 140. These indicators, which are quite impressive for a desktop 3D printer, should provide work with a wide range of available materials.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/818/43e/2b2/81843e2b296f43c6af3d4ce00d891abf.jpg"><br><br>  To demonstrate the possibilities was proposed by the author's model of a toy car.  Sergey Avetikov created it in the style of the future flagship PICASO 3D.  You can see the stylized letter X on the hood and a recognizable futuristic design, to match the new Designer X PRO case. <br><br>  The model is a national team and was printed in parts from different materials.  All parts, except for bumpers and wheels, were printed on a 0.1mm layer with a filling of 20%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2ba/aae/a3c/2baaaea3cf9b47478cd039af642f6ea5.jpg"><br><br>  The body is two-tone and printed from Dutch Filaments CARBON-P (black) and Dutch Filaments PET-G (green). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c0/70a/207/9c070a207cef4bfaad601972259582da.jpg"><br><br>  Both materials are very interesting, many have heard about PET-G and use it as a transitional material between PLA and ABS.  It is believed that this plastic took the best quality from PLA and ABS.  PET-G has higher operating temperatures than PLA, but slightly lower than ABS.  (PLA - 60 *, PET-G - 70 *, ABS - 100 *).  PET-G is more flexible than PLA, which means less brittle and more impact resistant.  Unlike ABS, we did not notice big shrinkage on PET-G.  The ‚Äútransparency‚Äù of this plastic allows you to see a very interesting ‚Äústriped‚Äù effect on the windows, although, as you can see, the texture of the wall from the PLA, in the same part of the model, does not raise doubts about the high quality of the print of the printer. <br><br>  The most interesting of the materials used is CARBON-P, and I would like to talk about it in more detail.  The material is 20% filled with carbon filament based on PET-G, manufactured by Dutch Filaments.  The manufacturer claims a higher operating temperature: 80 degrees, while the material itself has enhanced impact resistance and high interlayer adhesion. <br><br>  One of the interesting features of products made from this material is that when a part breaks, it breaks not in layers, as is usually the case, but in a completely different way: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ff/91e/235/6ff91e2356f9466aac349972e3d1df38.jpg"><br><br>  This suggests that the material is very interesting from the point of view of functional prototyping and printing ready-to-use products. <br><br>  That is why PET-G was chosen to print the carrier frame.  However, test prints showed: standard brass nozzles are consumable for this plastic, so PICASO 3D will offer users a line of interchangeable nozzles.  The line will consist of nozzles of various diameters, from 0.1mm to 0.8mm, including specialized nozzles for printing abrasive-containing materials. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9dc/005/fd0/9dc005fd0f30468bb3f4b3b49d4d57a1.jpg"><br><br>  The wheels are also designed specifically for printing with two materials. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e2/f76/5dd/7e2f765dd8a147be8cf465d525dc8b65.jpg"><br><br>  The discs were printed from PICASO 3D PLA, and the tires from Recreus FilaFlex.  Printing was made on a layer of 0.2mm with a filling of 20%, while the adhesion between the materials was very high.  The ability to print both flexible and solid materials in one task opens up new possibilities for both prototyping and creating ready-made functional products. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e10/4f9/8f4/e104f98f43d34fbe97ef1e9a4ea52bfa.jpg"><br><br>  There are massive bumpers on both sides, which are also printed from FilaFlex.  Printing was made with a layer of 0.2 mm with a filling of 20%.  Printing with this material is possible with soluble support. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5b2/4da/0ce/5b24da0cef8d4df1ba30c014eed65b11.jpg"><br><br>  If you turn the machine, it will become visible clockwork mechanism.  Polymaker Nylon gears, PICASO 3D ABS axles and PLA spring. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b58/bb9/c99/b58bb9c993ee419c9b8711d3431a4775.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c0e/268/aec/c0e268aec83e49cd96d6a4204e621adf.jpg"><br><br>  Later we will tell about the testing of materials with decorative properties (Dutch Filaments: MT-Bronze and Wood) and about the REC CAST burnable molding polymer, intended for the subsequent manufacture of parts in metal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a57/3df/6d8/a573df6d88364c42b6e7b71d4507a298.jpg"><br><br>  Designer X PRO will be presented for the first time at the <a href="http://conf.top3dshop.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dgt%26utm_medium%3Dmedia%26utm_campaign%3Dconference">TOP 3D EXPO</a> Conference on April 14, 2017.  During the exhibition and conference, which will be held at the DI Telegraph, you will be able to see the work of the printer, complex printed details, as well as to personally communicate with the product developers. <br><br>  With pre-order at Top 3D Shop you get not only a very good X Pro <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/picaso-3d-designer-x-pro.html">price</a> and free shipping, but also a discount on consumables - 20% for the whole 2017, as well as free training on how to work with a printer. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4de/ced/081/4deced08126946cb86010d5f646e9fa8.jpg"></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373355/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373355/</a></p>
