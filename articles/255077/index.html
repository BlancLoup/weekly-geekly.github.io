Then each team selects the most promising idea from a business point of view - and in an hour develops a business model, assesses the market, determines the target audience and promotion methods.  In the finals you stand before the jury, and the team with the best result is invited to the semifinal of the championship. <br><br><h2>  Star Wars Nights on April 18 and 25 at the Central House of Artists </h2><br>  And that says it all :) <a href="http://www.cha.ru/films">Fee</a> . <br><br>  That's all for today.
