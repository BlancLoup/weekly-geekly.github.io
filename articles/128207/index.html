There is a smaller screen, a worse camera, no dual-core processor, not so much memory, etc.  Wave 3 is comparable to the second tier of Samsung Android smartphones and belongs to the same price class - look at the Galaxy S Plus.  At the same time, the model differs from them in the traditional trump of top bada-backgrounds - this is metal in the case. <br><br><img src="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/hitech_img/8fae1ab5c2a6f652dbc069552d59b1db/r/490x368/i/86400.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Samsung very ambitiously launched its bada platform last year.  Smartphones on it were positioned as devices of a new generation, and in the structure of Russian sales they should have taken up to 50% of the entire Korean company portfolio.  Time put everything in its place.  Samsung bada did not become the killer of Android or iOS, but in some regions (especially in Russia) it has very good positions thanks to cheap models. <br><br><img src="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/hitech_img/0d3fc1ff3cd6a21453a724978521b0dd/r/490x327/i/86386.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Samsung highlights the bada flagships with design.  Even the most expensive Android-tubes of this brand are completely plastic (except for the recent Galaxy R, but there is only a small patch of metal there).  This will significantly forgive the Galaxy line and especially the Galaxy S II.  Wave 3 pleases with solid performance.  It's not just metal in the case, but a seamless frame, almost like HTC.  Expensive and pleasant, but on the other hand, thermal conductivity and wear resistance go sideways.  Accordingly, in the winter the body will be too cold, and in the summer too hot (Wave 3 noticeably heats up in operation), and the metal is scratched faster than plastic.  But the wear resistance of the metal is worse only to scratches, the plastic is less durable in general. <br><br><img src="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/hitech_img/99e41f280c02932fcc49db0b736cecc0/r/490x368/i/86398.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  What is important, with such active use of metal, Wave 3 is relatively light - only 122, which is 3 grams heavier than the all-plastic Galaxy S Plus.  Dimensions also do not fail.  Due to a slightly smaller display than the Galaxy S II, the display was able to make a more compact body.  The average thickness (9.9 mm) - exactly like the Galaxy S Plus, which is quite comfortable.  As for the assembly, there is no problem.  Thanks to the all-metal body, there is no backlash.  When squeezed Wave 3 does not creak.  The device is made at the highest level. <br><br><img src="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/hitech_img/ac561083c34a2b6b15c4e7c2d0e0c788/r/600x450/i/86391.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  All buttons and other items in stock.  Below is a 3.5 mm audio jack, as well as an interface microUSB and speaker.  On the sides of the key lock, as well as the volume rocker.  Front menu button and call keys.  The latter personally make me very happy with their presence after Android, where they have long been abandoned.  True, only the central mechanical key, and on the sides of the sensors - an amateur.  Let me remind you that the predecessors all the buttons on the front panel were mechanical. <br><br><img src="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/hitech_img/a8f4df10535ac3673b7ab23d155e7eb7/r/490x368/i/86394.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/hitech_img/674d150dc22d0e17e45fbcc7c86af10c/r/240x-/i/86387.jpg" alt="  Samsung Wave 3:   " title="Samsung Wave 3 preview: new flagship smartphone" width="240"> <a href="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/photo/review/Samsung_Wave_3-preview.html%3F9"><img src="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/hitech_img/8b3c73bf556d300ad7f7426bec1ea4eb/r/240x-/i/86388.jpg" alt="  Samsung Wave 3:   " title="Samsung Wave 3 preview: new flagship smartphone" width="240"></a> <br><br>  Hardware stuffing Wave 3 is not the most outstanding.  You can see the characteristics of the earlier Galaxy S Plus and get a complete picture of the Wave 3. Single-core 1.4 GHz processor, 5 megapixel camera with autofocus and flash, 3 GB available memory, etc.  In general, nothing special.  An interesting point: in my sample on the Qualcomm platform there is support for GLONASS at the chipset level.  This is the first smartphone for which this is officially announced globally.  But the presence of such functionality in the model, which will be released in Russia, Samsung has not officially announced.  This question will be solved closer to the beginning of sales. <br><br><img src="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/hitech_img/f8a6cff2829e5aec80596d507d570335/r/240x-/i/86383.jpg" alt="  Samsung Wave 3:   " title="Samsung Wave 3 preview: new flagship smartphone" width="240"> <a href="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/photo/review/Samsung_Wave_3-preview.html%3F6"><img src="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/hitech_img/a4943829a4d94895b21aba63346cf75f/r/240x-/i/86384.jpg" alt="  Samsung Wave 3:   " title="Samsung Wave 3 preview: new flagship smartphone" width="240"></a> <br><br>  Screen Super AMOLED with a diagonal of 4 "- as in last year's Galaxy S. Despite the prescription, the element is very good.  It is bright, contrasting, with excellent viewing angles, plus it reads well in the sun.  Of course, the Wave 3 does not compete with the Galaxy S II, but almost all other brands (especially HTC) are left behind.  Compare the behavior in the sun and indoors with Super AMOLED Plus: <br><br><img src="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/hitech_img/d6cb9139081249ee04585502d606bd17/r/600x450/i/86397.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The camera is quite ordinary for the latest flagships of Samsung, but quite good.  Photo 5 MP, video 720p @ 30 fps.  From the settings I will note touch focus - you can specify the object on which you want to focus in the frame.  The rest of the usual interface.  Examples of photography Samsung Wave 3 in the maximum quality settings: <br><img src="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/hitech_img/94efa5ff8613a5833786d29007ab9a33/r/240x-/i/86431.jpg" alt="  Samsung Wave 3:   " title="Samsung Wave 3 preview: new flagship smartphone" width="240"> <a href="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/photo/review/Samsung_Wave_3-preview.html%3F23"><img src="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/hitech_img/b2f8884a3e956f26de98ebe3c1a9fc97/r/240x-/i/86428.jpg" alt="  Samsung Wave 3:   " title="Samsung Wave 3 preview: new flagship smartphone" width="240"></a> <br><br><br> <a href="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/photo/review/Samsung_Wave_3-preview.html%3F24"><img src="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/hitech_img/ab0cc856bbc67014aa6289c5cc36f92a/r/240x-/i/86425.jpg" alt="  Samsung Wave 3:   " title="Samsung Wave 3 preview: new flagship smartphone" width="240"></a> <a href="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/photo/review/Samsung_Wave_3-preview.html%3F25"><img src="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/hitech_img/a555e1567ff87ba7595c9fcc0c16023b/r/240x-/i/86422.jpg" alt="  Samsung Wave 3:   " title="Samsung Wave 3 preview: new flagship smartphone" width="240"></a> <br><br>  The battery is quite capacious - 1500 mAh - this is a necessity with this processor and especially the screen.  As it should be, there is a recharge on microUSB.  A-GPS with 3D cartography and LBS, FM-radio with RDS and other standard features did not go anywhere.  Navigation Route 66. The operating time on the contrary pleases, lasts for a half to two days of active work, charging about two hours.  The same indicator for Android models is day.  There is better optimization at the bada platform.  A 720p video file with activated Wi-Fi was played for 5 hours and 13 minutes. <br><br><img src="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/hitech_img/af2676ecef72894a8d4d629901cd8945/r/600x450/i/86389.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Now let's talk about communications.  Like the Galaxy S II, our hero supports Wi-Fi Direct.  This is a standard that allows you to transfer information between multiple Wi-Fi devices.  A kind of advanced version of Bluetooth, infrared, etc.  The most important thing is the transfer rate, which corresponds to the usual Wi-Fi connection.  In addition, you can combine not only two devices, but more.  While the technology is not widespread, it is the groundwork for the future.  Unfortunately, given the plans of other manufacturers of rapid distribution, it will not receive, this is the prospect of the next years.  Therefore, it is too early now to consider support for Wi-Fi Direct as a big plus. <br><br><img src="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/hitech_img/f119a2c3476fce1a5b648435a226d754/r/240x-/i/86488.jpg" alt="  Samsung Wave 3:   " title="Samsung Wave 3 preview: new flagship smartphone" width="240"> <a href="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/photo/review/Samsung_Wave_3-preview.html%3F29"><img src="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/hitech_img/fdd5872a08c50ae32b99744eb5e2ebc0/r/240x-/i/86491.jpg" alt="  Samsung Wave 3:   " title="Samsung Wave 3 preview: new flagship smartphone" width="240"></a> <br><br><br> <a href="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/photo/review/Samsung_Wave_3-preview.html%3F30"><img src="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/hitech_img/a0a0969bafcca05ccad5641dc93678ee/r/240x-/i/86492.jpg" alt="  Samsung Wave 3:   " title="Samsung Wave 3 preview: new flagship smartphone" width="240"></a> <a href="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/photo/review/Samsung_Wave_3-preview.html%3F31"><img src="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/hitech_img/5dd60e23ac656c8a9bea0bf166fb082b/r/240x-/i/86495.jpg" alt="  Samsung Wave 3:   " title="Samsung Wave 3 preview: new flagship smartphone" width="240"></a> <br><br>  The rest of the Wave 3 is typical for the top-end class.  There is Bluetooth 3.0, Wi-Fi 802.11 b / g / n, microUSB with charging via cable, FM radio with RDS.  A-GPS with 3D cartography and LBS has not gone anywhere.  For navigation using Google Maps.  The quality of reception of FM-radio remained at the same level as the Galaxy S II, it is excellent.  The speaker volume is high, its quality is average.  The audio output quality is good, above average.  The power of vibration in most cases is sufficient, there is no problem with that. <br><br>  Software platform in Wave 3 - bada 2.0.  This is a new version, announced at the Mobile World Congress in February 2011.  Currently, seven Samsung Wave smartphones are based on bada.  It is expected that with the release of the new version of bada 2.0, the range will expand significantly. <br><br><img src="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/hitech_img/8d5b9259d91f21196399d26efcaa3079/r/240x-/i/86510.jpg" alt="  Samsung Wave 3:   " title="Samsung Wave 3 preview: new flagship smartphone" width="240"> <a href="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/photo/review/Samsung_Wave_3-preview.html%3F39"><img src="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/hitech_img/e0e9712c90be52eac3da0a1b63367217/r/240x-/i/86512.jpg" alt="  Samsung Wave 3:   " title="Samsung Wave 3 preview: new flagship smartphone" width="240"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/photo/review/Samsung_Wave_3-preview.html%3F40"><img src="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/hitech_img/a3264bffa86c4ca2e7792fe2458a229c/r/490x294/i/86511.jpg" alt="  Samsung Wave 3:   " title="Samsung Wave 3 preview: new flagship smartphone" height="294" width="490"></a> <br><br>  bada still has a much smaller number of applications than Android or iOS, and this is the main problem.  Currently, the range of the Samsung Apps store has about 40,000 applications, which is comparable to the Marketplace for Windows Phone 7. In version 2.0, a number of new functions became available to the user, including new features for making purchases and recommendations. <br><br><img src="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/hitech_img/48c54785ed467bc25786f4029e1ac8dc/r/240x-/i/86496.jpg" alt="  Samsung Wave 3:   " title="Samsung Wave 3 preview: new flagship smartphone" width="240"> <a href="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/photo/review/Samsung_Wave_3-preview.html%3F42"><img src="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/hitech_img/c903f6343c115e438f6aea0c3bda402a/r/240x-/i/86498.jpg" alt="  Samsung Wave 3:   " title="Samsung Wave 3 preview: new flagship smartphone" width="240"></a> <br><br><br> <a href="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/photo/review/Samsung_Wave_3-preview.html%3F43"><img src="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/hitech_img/7f7acc92ba926a1be6024765d47d68ed/r/240x-/i/86529.jpg" alt="  Samsung Wave 3:   " title="Samsung Wave 3 preview: new flagship smartphone" width="240"></a> <a href="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/photo/review/Samsung_Wave_3-preview.html%3F44"><img src="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/hitech_img/cceb2a9cd08851a14be1613b03e8aaa0/r/240x-/i/86533.jpg" alt="  Samsung Wave 3:   " title="Samsung Wave 3 preview: new flagship smartphone" width="240"></a> <br><br>  In version 2.0, the following are improved: multitasking, support for Wi-Fi Direct and Near Field Communication (NFC) technologies, as well as speech recognition.  In addition, the bada 2.0 platform supports HTML5 and improves work with many features of Flash technology.  A key feature for partner developers is the ability to place ads in applications (In-app Ads).  Using the Ads API program interface, developers will be able to embed advertising on their own and make a profit. <br><br><img src="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/hitech_img/0b94e9fab551d9b70665199ad10d4b48/r/240x-/i/86526.jpg" alt="  Samsung Wave 3:   " title="Samsung Wave 3 preview: new flagship smartphone" width="240"> <a href="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/photo/review/Samsung_Wave_3-preview.html%3F46"><img src="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/hitech_img/7e0227e28d9c3281430f0d29f9aced54/r/240x-/i/86536.jpg" alt="  Samsung Wave 3:   " title="Samsung Wave 3 preview: new flagship smartphone" width="240"></a> <br><br>  A set of applications for the standard Samsung.  The smartphone is equipped with pre-installed services ‚ÄúSocial Portal‚Äù (Social Hub) and ‚ÄúMusic Portal‚Äù (Music Hub).  There is also a new cross-platform communication service ChatON.  It is intended for communication between smartphone owners and Internet users.  Among its main features are chat conferences for simultaneous communication with several users, as well as the presence of a web client that allows you to share files and communicate with each other smartphone owners and Internet users. <br><br><img src="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/hitech_img/24a66cb86cde3c3b1216c3ce449f1418/r/332x490/i/86539.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The rest of the details of the device, you can learn from the video above, but for now - our short verdict. <br><br><img src="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/hitech_img/54477917ffff51c724df3d8f383ea9db/r/490x368/i/86399.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At first glance, Samsung Wave 3 is a guest from the past, or the second-tier flagship by Android standards.  But if we consider the new product in more detail, a very nice model is found.  First of all, it is an image solution.  Moreover, at a reasonable price (one and a half times lower than the flagship on Android - the Galaxy S II model).  In Europe, Wave 3 is estimated at 400 euros, our cost will be slightly higher, but only slightly.  For such money, the model is interesting.  There is not a single smartphone on the market that combines a seamless metal case and a large, high-quality screen.  This is the undisputed trump card of Wave 3. <br><br>  If it matters to you what a smartphone looks like, what materials it is made of, and the programs you need already exist for bada, Wave 3 can be a very good choice even with all the competitors.  Among the latter, primarily metal smartphones HTC.  But they have at least worse screen quality.  Indirectly, they oppose Samsung Android smartphones, especially the Galaxy S Plus.  But they are completely plastic.  As you can see, with reasonable pricing, Wave 3 has good chances in the market, especially in Russia, where bada handsets are historically more popular. <br><br>  <i>Editorial Hi-Tech@Mail.Ru</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128207/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128207/</a></p>
