And all for maximum benefit - to do a lot of things, remember more information, win laziness and so on.  Man has always tried to get the most out of his abilities. <br><br>  In the 80s of the twentieth century, another such method was invented - the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map">Mind Mapping</a> technology or the use of mental maps.

Mental maps - a convenient form of data recording, which allows even with a large amount to present it in a capacious form. </li><li>  <b>Memorization of</b> information.  When you write something in a convenient light form, it is automatically put off in your head. </li><li>  <b>Easy access</b> to information.  The data recorded in the form of mental maps, it is easy to recall, even after casting them only one glance. </li><li>  <b>Analysis of</b> information.  The mental map is constructed in such a way that allows you to see previously unnoticed communication between its parts, small unrecorded details, which is very valuable when making decisions.  Also, with its help, you can view all the information as a whole, in a comprehensive way, which generally helps to understand the topic and better understand this data. </li></ul><br><br>  Mental maps help to easily operate with information, which makes them very useful in many areas of our life: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/288/fae/b57/288faeb57a0d415f994b4238bdbf6893.png"><br><br><h5>  Why use it? </h5><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/981/504/f55/981504f55b264f90adf84708ef09fab3.jpg"></div><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúThe thought repeated twice is well remembered.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The thought repeated twice is well remembered. ‚Äù</i> </blockquote><br>  Mental maps help when working with any data, improve the brain's ability to perceive information, but why? <br><br>  The first reason lies in the very construction of the map - it is depicted in a radial form, the key image is in the center, and further branches diverge from it.  This <b>simplifies the flow of information into the brain</b> - after all, we also see the world around us as a whole - the central image and the details around it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/345/386/bdf/345386bdf2954a73ba131cb51109294b.png"><br><br>  The second reason also lies in the processing of information by our brain - <b>visualization in general <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/devexpress/blog/240325/">improves perception</a></b> .  Words with pictures, we memorize 6 times better than just words. <br><br>  When building a mental map <b>, various abilities of our thinking are activated</b> .  In drawing up branches and keywords, we use hierarchies; for pictures, visualization and associative thinking, in general, spatial-figurative thinking is used.  All this <b>activates the memory</b> and allows you to remember both the data structure and its important aspects, so the use of mental maps <a href="http://thinkbuzan.com/articles/mindmappingworks/">improves the memorization of information by about 32%</a> . <br><br>  Since we use various thinking abilities to build mental maps, such as <b>creativity, logic, imagination</b> , they all <b>develop and improve in the process</b> . <br><br>  Since mental maps reflect the whole picture, it allows you to <b>establish all the relationships</b> between objects, even if initially they were not so obvious.  In turn, this leads to the emergence of a <b>new point of view</b> on information, as well as new ideas and thoughts.  The structure and logic of the data become more ‚Äútransparent‚Äù, easy to understand and remember. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c4a/c72/7f6/c4ac727f60734bb38c7f9c8444ec5bb3.png"></div><br><br>  Another indisputable argument in favor of using mental maps is that it is <b>very easy to learn this technique</b> , and it is possible to remember information with its help immediately, in large numbers and very effectively.  It takes little to write while <b>saving time significantly</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/84c/d8c/a62/84cd8ca622b0463ca35c389d0d4149c0.png"><br><br><h5>  What are the differences from regular recordings? </h5><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúClarity gives focus‚Äù</i> </blockquote><br>  Line recording is the primary form of recording information that we use in school, university, work, and in many many institutions.  It is used in instructions, books, posters and generally everywhere.  Therefore, the use of such a form seems logical, convenient and correct. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f61/9da/a84/f619daa84cf9418da45525346f6fae7c.png"><br><br>  But can it only be a matter of habit?  There are some differences between linear recordings and mental maps, which may make it worth changing your habits. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e63/e0f/e69/e63e0fe693c24666a6be1ddee1a92e03.png"><br><br><ul><li>  The entire <b>structure of the</b> vertical textual information is rather <b>hard to see</b> , and in order to view everything, additional actions may be required, such as page turning or page scrolling.  And the cards are built on a circular principle, and with one glance you can capture all that is depicted. </li><li>  <b>The linear list is</b> ‚Äúpsychologically‚Äù <b>incomplete</b> , it can be continued, which prevents us from perceiving it holistically.  The complete map has all the elements in its place, it is thought out, arranged and complete. </li><li>  Our brain is not the best way to remember <b>monotonous records</b> , in contrast to the various pictures, colorful branches and colorfully decorated keywords. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f7a/54e/63e/f7a54e63e5c04742a8db8dc60ff59654.png"><br><br><ul><li>  In ordinary recordings, it is rather <b>difficult to single out the</b> most <b>important thought</b> ; it is lost in the numerous lists, highlighted and underlined words.  On the mental map, the main object of study is always in the center, and it is from it that the secondary branches and additional information diverge. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/24a/d36/6e0/24ad366e04d44a179801984a8c54c9dc.png"><br><br><ul><li>  Since we use visualization to build a mental map, we use the right hemisphere of the brain, which is responsible for aesthetics and thinking about the problem as a whole.  Due to this, we can think about the image on the map from different sides.  With linear recordings, such <b>engagement of the right hemisphere of the brain is minimal</b> . </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/933/bcc/9c5/933bcc9c5b8b4539b65fdaf8e1fe0384.png"><br><br><ul><li>  Linear records <b>take a lot of time</b> , because a person doesn‚Äôt write very quickly by hand.  We have to shorten the words, they are not always written clearly, and this is at the expense of the quality of the records. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/17b/8eb/0ef/17b8eb0ef79249968d21b7d6e5750b9d.png"><br><a name="Pop"></a><br><h4>  Are mental maps popular? </h4><br><h5>  Who came up with mental maps? </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3d8/d54/1dc/3d8d541dcb2c4ac0bbf465ff6a94bdfe.jpg" align="right"><br>  Analogues of various communication diagrams were used from a fairly early time, but the creator of the modern method of mental maps, such as we know it now, is <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D1%258C%25D1%258E%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD,_%25D0%25A2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8">Tony Busen</a> - an English psychologist, author and coauthor of more than 80 books, the most famous of which are considered ‚ÄúSupermind think yourself. "  The first book, describing the technique of mental maps, was published in 1974 - ‚ÄúWork your head‚Äù. <br><br>  Here is how the author describes the events that prompted the development of this technique: <br><blockquote> ‚ÄúIn my time in the second year of university, I somehow went to the library and asked if they had books on the theory of the brain and its practical capabilities.  The librarian, without hesitation, sent me to the department of medical literature! <br><br>  When I explained that I was not going to do brain operations, but only to use it correctly, they politely replied that they apparently did not have such books in the library. <br><br>  I went out in complete amazement. <br><br>  Like my other fellow students, I was in a condition known to any average student: a growing awareness that as the workload grows, your brain is increasingly losing ground over high demands on thinking, creativity, memory, problem solving, analysis and compose ‚Äùin the course of written work.  Like the others, I increasingly came across the phenomenon when the return from schoolwork falls, despite the efforts made, and sometimes it seems to be completely zero. The paradox was that, as I thought, the more I outlined and taught, worse was the result! <br><br>  The logical consequence of both possible strategies of action in that situation was, as it seemed to me, a dead end.  Become me less effort, the mass of important information falls into the category of the not learned, and, as a result, the failure of the exam.  If I continued with even more perseverance, outlining in more detail and spending more time on it, the result would be the same downward spiral of success. <br><br>  The key to true success, I finally reasoned, should be sought in answering the question of how rationally I use my intelligence in general and thinking abilities in particular ‚Äî an awareness of this led me to the library. <br><br>  When I got out of it that day, it suddenly occurred to me that the problem I faced, not finding the right literature, might have come in handy.  Since such books have not yet been written, I have stepped into a reserved area, where there is genuine space for an inquiring mind. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><h5>  Are they used in the world? </h5><br>  Over time, the feasibility of a particular technique is always determined by the number of people who use it.  Since the release of the first description of the technique, more than 40 years have passed, but nevertheless the technique of mental maps lives, develops, and, most importantly, is used.  Turn to Google Trends: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d1/00c/0bb/8d100c0bb8c843f2b852d1fd693c9783.png"><br><br>  In general, mind mapping is a consistently used query over the past 11 years.  The countries with the most such requests were suddenly Indonesia and Thailand.  Completely different statistics in Russia.  Only in 2011, this technique began to enjoy the interest in our country: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/35b/e3e/1ec/35be3e1ecc774d87968a126bdd7181a0.png"><br><br><h5>  Why don't people use them everywhere? </h5><br>  Like everything else in our world, mental map techniques also have disadvantages: <br><ul><li>  <b>Complex, complex things are simplified</b> , and many <b>details are extremely generalized</b> .  It creates the <b>appearance of order</b> where it is not.  Sometimes this is useful, but sometimes it only creates the illusion of control over the situation, the illusion of a common understanding of the problem and the absence of complex hidden interconnections. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/15e/c4d/1e6/15ec4d1e67c4426081cc8781583194a8.png"><br><br><ul><li>  Since the images are used in mapping, associative thinking is included.  But <b>associations</b> are dynamic things that <b>change and transform</b> over time, and what caused one association six months ago does not cause exactly the same now.  Such pictures direct the flow of thoughts when reading the map is not at all the other side, as originally planned.  ‚ÄúFalse‚Äù associations ultimately slow down the understanding of the data on the map. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/37d/9e4/c60/37d9e4c6081f442d8ddd69aa92e53d33.png"><br><br><ul><li>  The mental map is a reflection of one's thinking, or one person, the originator, or a group of such people, so the <b>cards</b> are often highly <b>individual</b> .  If you give the card to read another person, it may happen that he either does not understand some of the details, or, even worse, misunderstand them. </li><li>  When processing large or complex data when building a map, you can get a <b>complex picture</b> , with multiple divisions, with a huge number of links, branches and keywords.  The effectiveness of such a mental map falls at times. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ae/d05/b25/8aed05b25f04422191cfd22854fddb8f.png"><br><br>  This is one of the reasons why the technique of mental maps has still not supplanted linear records.  But there are also imaginary flaws that lie in the way of applying this technique: <br><ul><li>  <b>Ignorance of technology</b> .  The popularity of mental maps has not yet reached such a scale that everyone knew about them. </li><li>  Opinion <b>"I can not draw</b> . <b>"</b>  Many people believe that this is a serious obstacle to building a map, but in fact this skill is not required.  Moreover, there is a simple exercise that helps to prove that everyone can draw a minimal set of characters.  Try: </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2ea/898/b71/2ea898b716f848c8a19f748258b31f91.png"><br><br><ul><li>  The belief that <b>this is childish fun</b> and this professional is not what.  In fact, every self-respecting professional has his own set of various tools for achieving goals: visualization, planning, time management and others.  And the fact that many mental cards are used throughout the world is an indicator of the effectiveness of this tool. </li><li>  Mental maps take <b>longer to do</b> than linear recordings.  At first, at the beginning of the application of this technique, this will indeed be the case - just like when teaching any new business.  But in the future, the cards will click like nuts, much faster than regular notes. </li><li>  Persuasion <b>‚ÄúI think linear‚Äù</b> and ‚ÄúAll my life I use linear notes, and normal.‚Äù  Yes, linear records come into our lives tightly from the age of seven, and then it is much more convenient and more familiar to use them, even in my own thoughts.  But isn't this just a habit?  And if other methods give greater efficiency, then why not try them? </li><li>  Opinion "Mental maps <b>can not be used for everyday tasks</b> ."  On the contrary, this technique is applied to all areas of life where decision-making, any lists, analysis of something are required.  This includes almost any area of ‚Äã‚Äãour daily life. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/777/725/d1c/777725d1c7574376b53c919d97336187.png"><br><a name="Create"></a><br><h4>  How to create a mental map? </h4><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúEvery artist was at first a lover‚Äù</i> </blockquote><br>  To build mental maps, it is enough to follow certain simple principles.  Let's try for example to make a mental map for this entire article. <br><br>  First you need a clean horizontally rotated area, such as a sheet, board, tablet, phone, or a work area in graphic editors.  The more data you process, the more work space you'll need.  I will make my example using the online mental map editor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/81b/d0e/0f3/81bd0e0f361e4357a4bda783874e4c9b.png"><br><br>  In the center of the workspace, describe the image of the problem, task, or area of ‚Äã‚Äãknowledge.  In our case, this is an article about mental maps. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/999/9d1/d8a/9999d1d8aeab4711a8464419c392647d.png"><br><br>  Remember to use drawings and symbols wherever possible.  This will make the card more vivid and colorful, and as a result - more memorable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/68c/029/2a6/68c0292a660d4f6fbb6efbc4c0bebbf5.png"><br><br>  From the central image we lay thick structural branches, the main subsections of our article.  It is recommended to use different colors for key branches and words, as well as colorize them.  Since I love minimalism, I‚Äôll get a little away from the rules. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df2/249/933/df224993341b4858996197c32e00bf81.png"><br><br>  But nothing prevents me from arranging the main subsections with the corresponding pictures.  We also add the branches of the next level.  It must be remembered that there should be only one word on one branch.  This allows us not to overload the map, and in the process of inventing this one word, we can highlight the essence of the material. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/94b/a7d/c36/94ba7dc368f54c438160c9ea62404663.png"><br><br>  The size and thickness of the letters on the branches vary depending on the distance from the central image.  The farther - the less.  If there is a relationship between the details on the map - do not forget to show it.  Let's add our example with other branches and links. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a9/bad/aee/2a9badaee3dd437aa95ca4cbfebfe651.png"><br><br>  That was the finished mental map.  Not the most colorful because of my love for minimalism, but very informative. <br><a name="Soft"></a><br><h4>  Are there any programs for creating mental maps? </h4><br>  Drawing freehand mental maps is a pleasure for an amateur, and sometimes it is much more convenient to insert a map on a computer.
