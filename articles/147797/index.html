      I will not be limited to the field of IT, I will tell in general, if you let me. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  I see many books on the topic, how to develop leadership qualities, how to develop innovative thinking, how to become sociable and sociable.  Okay, I will not deny that there is useful information, but about the same thing as reading the theory of superman Nietzsche to fifth graders.  Many clever words, but little useful, and most importantly, no one will follow in this direction. <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/luxoft/blog/147723/">habrahabr.ru/company/luxoft/blog/147723</a> <br><br>  Here the article has an epic title: "You can become the next Steve Jobs: nine ways to become a visionary."  In which they assure us that each person can become an innovative prophet of the level of Steve Jobs.  Let's be honest with ourselves: "If your name is Ivan Ivanovich, you are Ivan Ivanovich and you will be."  No two people are alike, although it is useful to imitate a successful model of behavior and decision-making, but fanaticism is not necessary. <br><br>  If you can start thinking, start analyzing your situation and your business, you will sooner or later see mistakes and find a way to eliminate them or minimize them.  But if you spend all your time exploring motivating books, on books that have no practical value or talk about ‚Äúa wonderful tool for solving your problems,‚Äù I can upset you.  You are busy with the wrong topic. <br><br>  If you know how to do something, and it brings you joy, God see, do it.  Develop in this direction.  Now is the time when there are only managers around, and there are no people who know how to do something well.  And it really scares.  If you like coding, grow in this direction, if you decide to go to a management position, two things are waiting for you: <br><br>  1) Separation from your favorite work <br><br>  2) "What the hell does our programmer do, I would have made it faster and easier in his place."  You really can do everything better and faster, because you love code, but as a manager, code is not your priority. <br><br>  I was lucky to communicate with different people.  However, a combination of a successful leader and an unhappy person is not uncommon.  My friend's father grew up in a village on a saw bench, one might say, a carpenter with hands from God.  He really loves working with wood, smelling fresh sawdust, but if your wife is nagging you every day, you need to do something different.  Now he is the owner of a wood processing plant and he is unhappy because he was torn away from his beloved business.  And every day he enviously passes by ordinary carpenters. <br><br>  I do not suggest that everyone take off their business suit, and burn it along with The Wall Street Journal, but dispel the ashes on the seashore of freedom. <br><br>  All people are different, someone likes to calmly deal with the papers, someone needs action from presentations and negotiations.  Someone can arrange about 5-10 meetings for one day, and someone in the morning cannot find a second sock.  And that's fine. <br><br>  Almost in every second book: ‚ÄúAfter reading this book, you will not understand how you lived without it before.‚Äù  He lived, I live and will continue to live well.  All people live as they want.  Someone thinks about high matters, someone silently does. <br><br>  And now, as for doctors.  I can imagine that you came here only because of the name. <br><br>  It is very difficult to study as a doctor, you need to learn every bone, every bone attachment, eat next to the dead, and know Latin.  And here we get a specialist who knows a wide range of drugs, can do a general inspection and say: "Well, what to do, drug prices are like that." <br><br>  Military doctors are taught differently.  The main goal - to save lives at any cost.  At the sight of a person who needs help, he does not begin to remember which drug should be given for what, he may not provide 100% correct help.  But he will act at that very moment, and he will do everything possible to save you. <br><br>  If you have any problem, or something bothers you.  Start acting right now.  I am sure you will not immediately find the optimal solution, but sooner or later you will find it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147797/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147797/</a></p>
