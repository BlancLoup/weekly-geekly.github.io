Having spent the whole day looking for courses in which they would not be taught to write SEO, but human, meaningful and understandable texts, I realized that there are not so many options at the moment. <br><br>  To save time for everyone who may also be interested in this issue, I decided to collect all the courses from proven authors in this material. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  ‚ÄúInformation Style and Text Editing‚Äù, Maxim Ilyakhov </h4><br>  Maxim Ilyakhov is the chief editor of the design bureau Artyom Gorbunov and a promoter of the information style of writing texts.  He created the service glvrd.ru, which helps to clear the text from verbal garbage.  In addition, Artem keeps free and paid newsletters, and also teaches editors in a special course. <br><br>  From the <a href="http://artgorbunov.ru/educenter/text/">description</a> on the site: <br><br><blockquote>  <i>The objective of the course is to help develop an automatic editing skill.</i>  <i>For this course eight practical tasks are added.</i>  <i>Under the leadership of the leading participants practiced in editing, create an illustrated informational article and the promotion page.</i> </blockquote><br>  Each day of the course consists of two parts - lectures and practice.  Using examples, Maxim teaches students editing at the level of words, sentences, paragraphs, the entire text and the general information product, paying particular attention to the writing of advertising texts. <br><br>  <b>To whom this may be interesting</b> : Anyone who wants to write good business texts, such as pages of websites, mailing lists, materials in blogs, etc. <br><br>  <b>Price</b> : 40000 rubles.  (separate member), 59000 rubles.  (representative of the company)* <br><br>  <i>* for the next classes in March the recording is closed</i> <br><br><h4>  ‚ÄúLetters that shoot at the head‚Äù, Sergey Abdulmanov </h4><br>  Sergey Abdulmanov is a co-owner of an advertising agency and director of marketing for Mosigra, which has been running a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/">popular blog</a> on Habrahabr for many years. <br><br>  On the <a href="http://tceh.com/edu/contentmarketing1/">course,</a> Sergey talks about content marketing and brand journalism.  Describes the real cases of creating texts for companies from different fields - all materials for people, not search engines.  In addition, some obscure points are considered, such as working with B2B clients on B2C sites. <br><br>  <b>To whom this may be interesting</b> : Employees of marketing departments who want to understand how to set tasks for copywriters, for copywriters themselves, who want to understand how to write fascinating texts. <br><br>  <b>Price</b> : 15000 rub.  per person * <br><br>  <i>* for the next classes in March the recording is closed</i> <br><br><h4>  ‚ÄúHow to learn how to talk about business is interesting,‚Äù the founders of the Rockin'Robin media hub </h4><br>  Over the past two years, the appearance of the <a href="http://www.rockinrobin.co/">Rockin'Robin</a> project has become one of the most noticeable phenomena on the runet's content marketing <a href="http://www.rockinrobin.co/">scene</a> - his team creates texts for blogs (including on Habrahabr) and distribution in the media.  Its creators are Alexander Lashkov, who previously worked as the editor of the popular online business publication Zuckerberg Calls (now VC.ru), and Dmitry Kabanov, an expert in podcasting, sound recordings and the founder of <a href="http://vigorousspace.co/">Vigorousspace</a> Internet radio. <br><br>  Specialists have extensive experience writing materials on technical resources (Habrahabr, ixbt.ru), so much attention is paid to the creation of complex technical content. <br><br>  From the <a href="http://www.rockinrobin.co/services/">description</a> on the site: <br><br><blockquote>  <i>The target audience is not beginner authors, we will not tell absolutely basic things.</i>  <i>The emphasis on practice, analysis of the mistakes of real companies and non-trivial questions like ‚Äúwhat to write about, when it seems that they have already written about everything‚Äù, ‚Äúhow to get information from developers who don‚Äôt need it‚Äù and things like that.</i>  <i>The topic of creating texts in English for foreign promotion is also considered.</i> </blockquote><br>  The important point is that, unlike the rest of the courses, this material takes place not only physically in one particular place (there were no records for March at all), but companies can organize field seminars right in their office. (or in a conference mode in another city). <br><br>  <b>Who would be interested in this</b> : marketers of technology companies, heads of such companies and startups, copywriters who want to learn how to talk about business is simple and clear <br><br>  <b>Price</b> : the site is not listed, but there is evidence that it amounts to 50,000 rubles for a seminar in the company (unlimited number of employees) <br><br><h4>  School of Digital Media Editors, Nikolay Kononov </h4><br>  The editor-in-chief of the Secret Firm publication and the author of the best-selling book about the founder of the most popular Russian social network Durov Code in March will hold its third author's <a href="http://tceh.com/edu/editorschool/">course</a> . <br><br>  From the course <a href="http://theoryandpractice.ru/courses/24185">description</a> on Theory and Practice: <br><br><blockquote>  <i>The classes will discuss the most important aspects of editorial management - from individual work with authors and polishing texts to financial strategy and engaging the audience.</i>  <i>‚ÄúAfter 5 years, media editors are finally divided into those who pack small-caliber content (cues, pictures, filters), and those who plan, design and produce well-developed, complex stories,‚Äù explains Kononov.</i>  <i>‚ÄúMy course is for the second.</i>  <i>And also for those who make their own media. ‚Äù</i> </blockquote><br>  <b>Who would be interested in this</b> : digital media publishers and journalists involved in these projects <br><br>  <b>Price</b> : 30000 rubles.  per person <br><br>  <i>* at the beginning of March 2016 there were two places on the course</i> <br><br>  What other quality courses for copywriters and text writers do you know?
