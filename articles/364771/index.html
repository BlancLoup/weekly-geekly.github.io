And it's not just about pictures, songs or videos, but even about links to copyrighted content.

As conceived by the MPAA, a list of sites that search engines and ISPs will necessarily block should be compiled, and the server addresses of such sites will be permanently deleted from the DNS system.  This was actually voiced by the Attorney General of the State of Mississippi, which incited the <a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/jim-hood-sopa-mpaa/%3Ft%3DdXNlcmlkPTUyMjg0NjA5LGVtYWlsaWQ9OTM3OA%3D%3D">wrath of human rights activists</a> and the squall of calls and letters from Internet users. <br><br>  <b>What is the main problem of censoring websites?</b> <br><br>  In addition to the obvious huge problems associated with the need to <a href="http://changecopyright.ru/">reform copyright law</a> , there is another very important aspect of the issue.  Almost every website gives its users the freedom to post different content.  Ensuring legal authority to censor entire sites filled by users themselves is the actual provision of authority to destroy entire communities, such as Reddit, Tumblr, YouTube, Pinterest, as well as any other sites in which people express themselves. <br><br>  Users and civic activists are obviously not prepared for random media companies to have the right to destroy their favorite sites. <br><br>  At the request of the publication <i>Huffington Post,</i> Jim Hood announced the list of sites that search engines and telecom operators will be required to block.  Where the legs of this list grow is quite understandable.  He was made up by the friends of a corrupt MPAA prosecutor. <br><br>  This undercover game could have gone unnoticed by anyone, if not for the network-merged emails, which became available only through a <a href="http://piratemedia.net/opublikovan-spisok-konfidencialnyh-dokumentov-sony-pictures">hacker attack</a> on Sony Pictures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0a5/000/3a9/0a50003a9d58b03e2733aab09f3666fc.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/sony/%3Ft%3DdXNlcmlkPTUyMjg0NjA5LGVtYWlsaWQ9OTM3OA%3D%3D">Resentment of the Internet community</a> has become even more after the publication of The Verge has published information about the upcoming <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/12/12/7382287/project-goliath">‚Äúproject Goliath‚Äù</a> , a conspiratorial campaign of Hollywood companies against Google.  Sony Pictures actually acknowledged what was reported by news outlets after Sony lawyers <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/15/business/sony-pictures-demands-that-news-organizations-delete-stolen-data.html%3F_r%3D0">sent out online media</a> requests to remove ‚Äústolen information‚Äù from sites. <br><br>  The story of the hacker attack on Sony was accompanied by a number of very <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/12/13/timeline-sony-breach-data-leaks-far/%3Ft%3DdXNlcmlkPTUyMjg0NjA5LGVtYWlsaWQ9OTM3OA%3D%3D">ridiculous official statements</a> , like the hacking was organized by North Korea.  Kim Jong-un disowned these accusations, calling the statements of American officials nonsense, and warned about the possible consequences of libel.  It wouldn‚Äôt have happened, but if North Korea <i>hadn‚Äôt hacked</i> Sony Pictures, trying to <i>censor a</i> Hollywood comedy about the murder of a North Korean dictator called ‚ÄúInterview,‚Äù society would never know about secret plans to introduce censorship of the American Internet. <br><br>  Fight For The Future and other American associations to protect the rights of Internet users continue <a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/sony/%3Ft%3DdXNlcmlkPTUyMjg0NjA5LGVtYWlsaWQ9OTM3OA%3D%3D">Internet campaigns</a> against MPAA and lobbying plans to reanimate the most dangerous SOPA law, which can seriously hit a large number of Internet resources.  Despite the fact that the US is far enough away from us, Russian Internet users also have the opportunity to express their solidarity with US civilian activists who are trying to stop the distraught lobbyists of the Hollywood hills. <br><br>  We should not forget that after corporations can impose new rules of the game for Internet services in the United States, which benefit only American film producers, similar attempts will be made in other jurisdictions, as was the <a href="https://pirate-party.ru/content/%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2582-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0-sopa-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE-%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BC-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8">case in Russia</a> , when it was signed under pressure from the largest American copyright holders. anti-piracy memorandum between the Russian Federation and the United States, ‚Äùand soon <a href="http://rublacklist.net/5727/">‚Äú anti-piracy law ver.</a>  <a href="http://rublacklist.net/5727/">1.0 ‚Äù</a> . <br><br>  But while the American community is fighting against laws that are harmful to the Internet, for Russian users, it seems, the worst times have already come when the <a href="http://rublacklist.net/9282/">Federal Law dated November</a> 24, 2014 <a href="http://rublacklist.net/9282/">No. 364-FZ (‚Äúanti-piracy law ver. 2.0)</a> was signed <a href="http://rublacklist.net/9282/">by the</a> President on November 24, 2014. <br><br>  Currently, all those who care about the Runet may sign a <a href="https%253A%252F%252Fsecure.avaaz.org%252Fru%252Fpetition%252FPrezident_Rossiyskoy_Federacii_Vladimir_Putin_Otmenit_Federalnyy_zakon_ot_24112014_no_364FZ_antipiratskiy_zakon%252Fedit%252F%26sa%3DD%26sntz%3D1%26usg%3DAFQjCNETZjbIriASirfZfv7czX7Dr8uGcA">petition on AVAAZ to repeal the ‚Äúanti-piracy law‚Äù</a> , also known as ‚ÄúRussian SOPA‚Äù, which from May 1, 2015 will block any website for any infringement of exclusive copyright on any digital content. <br><br>  In addition, I remind active members of the Habra community who ‚Äúdo not want to look at the table,‚Äù that another <a href="https://www.roi.ru/16257/">ROI</a> is waiting for you at the <a href="https://www.roi.ru/16257/">ROI</a> ‚Äúto cancel the implementation of the concept of the Russian Union of rights holders about the introduction of an anti-piracy fee on the Internet. <br><br>  You can also <a href="http://rublacklist.net/9598/">express your attitude</a> on the proposed initiative of Mr. Mikhalkov by calling or writing to the responsible person of the Ministry of Culture until December 26, 2014. <br><br>  <i><b>PS:</b> We in the <a href="http://freerunet.ru/">IPA</a> and <a href="http://changecopyright.ru/">VMK</a> team need the help of Internet activists to create a landing page with petitions, stubs for Internet services, and banners for partners to organize a wider campaign of protest against the adopted and upcoming ‚Äúanti-piracy legislation‚Äù.</i>  <i>I ask everyone who can help us with this, contact the PM.</i>  <i>Only together we can keep our Internet free!</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364771/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364771/</a></p>
