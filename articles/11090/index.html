      <b>English speaking</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.43things.com/">43things</a> - offer to create an account and choose 43 (or any other number, of course) things you want to do in life.  Once done, press the corresponding button.  You can ‚Äúencourage‚Äù (cheer) your favorite ‚Äúgoals‚Äù (goals) for the people you like.  You can ‚Äúmake a call‚Äù (call yourself) yourself and designate by what date what goal you are going to accomplish and what you are going to do if you cannot.  Honestly, I always wanted to write ‚ÄúOtherwise I'll kill myself,‚Äù but I never wrote it.  :) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="http://bestuff.com/">Best Stuff</a> , formerly known as <b>The Best Stuff in the World</b> - here you can look around :) and see what is beautiful in this life.  Favorite drink, chemical element, computer game, cell phone maker - whatever.  Most likely, someone already shares your love :)) and you will be able to add your list of such things with almost one click.  Otherwise, in the same way, the name is entered into the appropriate field and is very easy to create - you can optionally add a picture (you can not even have one) and a description.  A fun mozayka of Front Page Mosaic images is built on the main page, and the more people like the thing, the bigger its picture. <br><br>  <a href="http://wis.dm/">wis.dm</a> is now the main polling place, which can be answered negatively or affirmatively.  The results are sometimes very surprising, because, for example, to my question, if up to a certain moment, if dear voting pizza eats, 100% of voters answered that they were eating.  And it was already at least 20 people.  As you understand, everyone can ask questions and on any topic - good fun is obtained.  A small departure from the topic, but judging by one of my surveys, Windows on this site, at least within a virtual machine, is used by only about 80 percent of visitors, which is good news. <br><br>  <b>Russian speakers</b> <br>  <a href="http://2ch.ru/">Two.ch</a> is one of the so-called imageboards, where each message can be, and sometimes just necessarily complement the picture, which is displayed next to him.  The resource carries the proud name of ‚Äúfree communication‚Äù, so that the interests of the user, at least until child pornography (the only thing that is really removed almost guaranteed), remain the interests of the user.  Well, according to this description it is already easy to decide that Dva.ch is a bunch of perverts.  It is not, in fact.  You can simply not go to the ‚Äúnonsense‚Äù section and all sections of the ‚ÄúAdult‚Äù category - then your brain has all the chances to stay with you.  :) <br><br>  <a href="http://bash.org.ru/">bash.org.ru</a> , <b>Quotation of the Runet</b> , and in the people often <b>bashorg</b> , <b>bash</b> , or just <b>BOR</b> - the project of the same person as the previous one - his name is zoi.  They are even located physically on the same server.  As far as I remember (oh, but I found time for something else), initially all the quotes (dialogues) were copied from the IRC, and specifically from the RusNet network.  Now there are even just small stories of people about what happened to them or their friends.  I always recommend starting with the <a href="http://bash.org.ru/best">best</a> section, but here, unlike the previous resource, the brain can no longer be saved - get used to it.  :) <br><br>  <b>Multilingual</b> <br>  Wikimedia projects - probably everyone knows about <a href="http://wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> .  It is also not a secret to anyone that it is available in such exotic languages ‚Äã‚Äãas Siberian artificial, what can we say about Latin or Esperanto.  But did you know that vikimedia von (Wikimedia) also supports several other interesting projects built on the same technology?  In particular, I highly recommend visiting <a href="http://wiktionary.org/">Wiktionary</a> and <a href="http://wikibooks.org/">Wikibooks</a> .  Well, if you're interested, please go to the <a href="http://wikimedia.org/">wikimedia.org</a> page, from which it is very easy to go to any project of the foundation. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/11090/">https://habr.com/ru/post/11090/</a></p>
