  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Combine and conquer. Integration of cloud-based IP PBX, CRM and mobile communications</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The time elapsed since the publication of the last entry in our blog on Megamind, we tried not to waste.  Honestly after having taken a good leave and having understood the project once again, the development team came to the only right decision: to try to become the leader in the cloud IP-PBX market right now - a dream from the category of ‚ÄúFly to the Moon‚Äù both in terms of labor costs and in terms of budgets.  The SaaS telephony market has become as competitive and dense as it once was the market for conventional IP telephony.  All analytics made by us and our partners clearly shows: there is a place for growth, but to strive for it in standard ways, mastering huge marketing budgets, the strategy is not the right one.  We will inevitably lag behind the three-five unconditional leaders.  In fact, what is happening now in the cloud segment is more a war of PR and marketing and only secondarily a war of technologies.  Technologically, many platforms are identical and, at times, it is difficult to understand how one solution differs from another functionally. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c9c/784/b09/c9c784b09faa4a17beb64ca080cf184b.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For ourselves, we have chosen a different path - we will develop niche solutions, namely, to beat-play back various integration of cloud telephony with CRM-systems and mobile communications.  And in this area, according to sensations, the new player is breathed much freer.  Offhand, after sitting a couple of hours in Google, we almost found no direct or indirect competitors. <br><br>  The clients helped us to finally establish themselves in the correctness of the chosen strategy - any attempt to sell the "newly called" typical set of services of the telephone operator of the 2015 sample, met with quite tangible resistance - "you need to think, I will call you back and why are you better than competitors."  But, it was worth starting to talk about the benefits of integrating <a href="http://zeonpbx.ru/">ZEON PBX</a> with CRM systems, helpdesks and other timviewers. The client immediately had a lot of questions and, as a rule, such communication ended with an agreement to send a commercial offer.  That's nice, that's where the dog rummaged.  Moving towards integration.  Moreover, we have something to offer delicious - an extremely interesting convergent solution at the junction of mobile communication and Internet telephony.  These are our IP ZEON SIM cards that can communicate with PBX via SIP protocol.

      One of the mobile operators, in cooperation with our partners, produces special SIM cards that work as ordinary IP phones and do not have a federal number.  SIM cards can be controlled directly from the interface of our ZEON, assign short numbers to them, assign caller ID, attach SIM cards to voice scripts, i.e. use them just as you would use regular office phones with all VoIP stuffing - recording conversations, statistics, online monitoring, IVR. <br><br>  <b>The interaction of ZEON and IP SIM-cards looks like this:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/483/87f/bd6/48387fbd6c9f404da4c93fe7717a0ead.jpeg"><br><br>  Sim cards work in a single number space with regular office phones and are completely identical to them in functionality: all calls from a SIM card fall into the PBX, are processed by scripts, recorded and controlled.  An employee on the mobile, who dials the short number of his colleague, will go directly to his work phone in the best traditions of corporate communications.  When an incoming short number is displayed, the call can be transferred, held, placed on HOLD or switched to voice script. <br><br>  Such a somewhat unusual pattern of corporate cellular operation allows you to significantly optimize business processes and increase control over calls in the company.  Now all employees, including those who are constantly on the run and constantly on the mobile, are part of a single corporate telephone network.  Excellent, promising, beginning for a curious, niche, service.  Now you need to add intrigue and make the product even more attractive - and not to integrate all this beauty with the most popular CRM systems so that our dear customers can access digital happiness with three easy clicks of the mouse. <br><br>  The commander-in-chief of the developers, the guru and sannyasin of the asterisk and VoIP, the technical director Oleg, literally in a couple of nights developed the necessary roadmap, thought out the details and undertook to do the impossible - to turn our ZEON into a platform that can simultaneously interact with CRM systems and with corporate cellular communication and not just to interact, but to interact in such a way that all this multi-level integration allows for the implementation of scenarios with the participation of several client units, his courier service on mobile and from  ate logistics, accounting control, which hovers over all this and controls and distributes. <br><br>  <b>Now we look like this:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef7/510/8cd/ef75108cdb1b4122aed11af9de4d0daf.jpeg"><br><br>  On the one hand, stationary and fixed phones of the company, on the other hand, a couple of the most popular cloud CRM and carefully developed API, which allows, if necessary, to fasten the Pentagon's ERP system.  By the way, we have not sent them KP. <br><br>  We didn‚Äôt add anything special to the ZEON interface, because integration with CRM is hidden somewhere very deep inside Zeon, and integration with mobile communication, in its essence, also does not require extra buttons, since Simka, from the PBX point of view, is a normal IP -Phone and an internal line for a SIM card is created in the same way as the most usual internal line for an ordinary softphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eca/6ac/650/eca6ac65014b427db65c80ab15dc06dc.jpeg"><br><br>  The only thing that had to be added was a special section in the settings, where mobile employees were divided into a separate group solely for ease of management.  A couple of nights of intense coding and new check-stars are ready too.  Tested, pressed and working as it should.  Before the conquest of the snowy peaks of the integrations, literally a couple of small passes remained. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/093/43f/ac0/09343fac040f4cc4af8daa9afb4502dc.jpeg"><br><br>  It is clear that even a specialist does not immediately understand the beauty, irresistible and beauty of the invented solution.  The first attempts to sell the integration miracle gave a clear understanding of the fact that the three lines in the email do not get off here and customers often do not understand how close the state of digital nirvana is and what advantages they get by implementing our ZEON.  You need to sit down and draw, draw, draw. <br><br>  <b>If we explain ‚Äúon the fingers‚Äù, then we have the following solution:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/075/ab1/339/075ab1339d7d4381b94f0b0129a4566e.jpeg"><br><br>  Now on a couple of short examples we will show how you can apply our Zeon together with mobile communications and CRM <br><br>  <b>The first example.</b>  <b>Real estate agency</b> <br><br>  <i>One of the main tasks of any real estate agency is as many rental and purchase transactions as possible.</i>  <i>The main combat unit in any AN is a realtor-performer, traveling around the city to view, show, deal.</i>  <i>A realtor is only listed in the State of the Academy of Sciences, and in fact he wants to carry out the transaction himself, without the participation of the Academy of Sciences himself.</i>  <i>In this case, he will receive not half of the commission, but the entire commission.</i>  <i>Our task is not to give him a chance to fool.</i>  <i>To do this, we deploy Zeon, issue a sim card to the agents and integrate it all with CRM.</i>  <i>Now all calls of a realtor from a mobile phone, without options, are visible in the statistics of the PBX, are recorded and in addition are displayed in CRM in the transaction card.</i>  <i>Calls from customers go to a single advertising number, and then are redirected to mobile agents in the same way as to ordinary internal phones, recorded and attached to a card in CRM.</i>  <i>Now everything is visible and audible.</i>  <i>For an outgoing call from a cellular agent, it is not the cellular number that is determined, but, again, a single advertising number of the company.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>It is enough for the head of the NA to enter CRM, filter the deals by the necessary employee and see what happens there.</i>  <i>‚ÄúWhat is the same‚Äù means not only the planned budget and status, but also the complete statistics of all conversations between the realtor and the owner, the recording of their conversations from mobiles, the full tracking of what is happening.</i>  <i>With a light click of the mouse, you can change the person responsible for the transaction and then all incoming clients from the client‚Äôs phone will start to flow to another, more honest agent, and the client will not even feel it.</i>  <i>It was simply routed.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>We already have experience of similar implementation and we plan to talk about it in more detail in one of the following publications.</i> <br><br>  <b>An example of the second.</b>  <b>Delivery service</b> <br><br>  <i>The situation is largely identical to the situation with realtors.</i>  <i>Exactly the same mobile employees travel a lot around the city and actively call customers, and customers call them.</i>  <i>The difference is that there is no special need to hide the courier customer numbers from each other, except for convenience.</i>  <i>The key point in this whole story is the recording of conversations and control, in case the refrigerator was brought at the wrong time or brought not a refrigerator, but a washing machine.</i>  <i>Some clients in such cases like to roll out claims, demand a refund and be very nervous.</i>  <i>Having on hand a record of all conversations from mobile couriers, many slippery moments can be avoided: it will become clear what, who brought it to and when.</i>  <i>Moreover, all this is fixed in the CRM and is easily located.</i>  <i>If there is a desire from the owner of the delivery service, you can implement the most fantastic scenarios: for example, forcing a courier to dial on the cell is not the real customer number, but the order number.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Since SIM cards are fully controlled by ZEON, there is nothing impossible in this - you need to match the order number in CRM and the real customer number, and we will continue to act: at the right stage, we will translate the order number to the real phone number and send the call to the destination.</i>  <i>We have experience and similar implementation.</i> <br><br>  The examples given are just a drop in the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãintegration capabilities of IP-PBX ZEON, CRM and mobile communications.  We plan to break the descriptions of the cases into several parts and gradually post here, on the ZEON PBX blog, on the Megamind. <br><br>  Having finished this publication, we almost immediately sit down at a new one, and this means that CONTINUATION IS FOLLOWING ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295048/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295048/</a></p>
