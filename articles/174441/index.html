      For example, in the data center of one large Internet company, more than 1,000 Huawei S5700 switches and over a dozen S9312 switches are deployed, featuring high-performance and high-density ports.  Developing its strategy for the corporate market, the company released a new series of Sx700 switches, and its business model now includes both the introduction of corporate solutions through its business partners and the independent implementation of projects at the system integrator level, using its experience and capabilities. <br><br>  All modern Huawei equipment supports cloud solutions, and the company's cloud platforms are focused both on telecom operators and enterprises - to create a corporate private cloud.  In addition, the company customizes its solutions for specific industries. <br><br>  <b>New Sx700 Ethernet Switch Series</b> <br><br>  Huawei's high-performance Quidway S family switches, designed for enterprise networks of various sizes, are designed for use at the access, aggregation and campus core levels, as well as for installation in modern virtualized data centers. <br><br>  These devices, characterized by advanced functionality and energy efficiency, have common architectural and structural components, including the VRP (Versatile Routing Platform) operating system, the command line interface, and power modules.  The Huawei VRP universal routing platform software meets the requirements for accessing a variety of services on Ethernet networks.  The Sx700 uses energy-saving integrated circuits to ensure uniform heat dissipation.  This allows you to do without fans, make the device more reliable and economical.  Free ports go into sleep mode, reducing power consumption. <br><br>  Characteristic features of this family of models include support for IPv4 / IPv6 protocols, which allows them to be used in IPv4 networks, IPv6 networks or networks that use both protocols, non-blocking switching mode, the ability to form stacks, hot backup of the main components, ease of installation and operation, availability versions with PoE and PoE +. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0bc/f72/820/0bcf7282090f29a15fcd1e2075312e99.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The Quidway Sx700 switch line includes devices of the S1700, S2700, S3700, S5700, S6700, S7700 and S9700 series.  Characteristic features of this equipment include advanced security features that include protection against DoS attacks;  DHCP snooping based on the analysis of MAC and IP addresses, lease times for IP addresses, VLAN IDs and user access interfaces;  protection against attacks using the ARP protocol;  centralized MAC address authentication and 802.1x authentication. <br><br>  To ensure the quality of service (QoS), traffic is classified using information contained in packets, such as 5-tuple, IP-preference, ToS, DSCP, type of IP protocol, type of ICMP, source port TCP, VLAN ID, type of protocol Ethernet, class of service CoS. <br><br>  Other protocols and features implemented by Quidway S switches include Enhanced Trunk channel duplication technology;  Smart Ethernet Protection Protocol;  ring network protocol used on the Ethernet link layer;  forming a group of devices based on the VRRP protocol. <br><br>  To manage the switches and their administration, the SNMP v1 / v2 / v3 protocols, the program line interface, and the Web NMS, Telnet, and HGMP protocols are used.  There are automatic configuration mode, support for plug-and-play functionality, deployment using a USB flash drive and remote upgrade. <br><br>  The Intelligent Stack feature (iStack) allows you to combine several Sx700 switches into a stack that works as a single virtual switch and is managed by a single IP address.  In this case, the backup switch assumes the load when the main switch fails, minimizing the interruption of services.  iStack increases scalability, improves network reliability and simplifies its architecture. <br><br>  These and many other features make it possible to use the Huawei Quidway Sx700 series switches as universal building blocks for creating various configurations of new generation networks that meet the requirements of the IT infrastructure of modern enterprises. <br><br>  <b>Access Switches S1700</b> <br><br>  S1700 Series devices are access switches with 8-48 Gigabit ports supporting optical SFP modules.
