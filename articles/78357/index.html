  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Russia. My decision</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many thanks to everyone who took part in the discussion on the topic <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hr/78066/">‚ÄúRussia.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hr/78066/">Bend over or move up? ‚Äù</a> I really liked it.  Thank. <br>  So, the discussion continued for three days.  For three days I read the comments, pondered.  Almost during the week I asked this question to my friends.  I tried to accumulate for myself the most important facts and statements.  The task is not trivial: to organically fit all the observations into your well-established view.  In the end, I found the answer.  But, since it concerns for the most part only me, I publish it in a personal blog. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  During the discussion, many, I think (I‚Äôm sure), looked at some things from the other side, learned something new about Russia and other countries.  It's nice that people's positions are clear and in most cases there is an argument in favor of their words. <br>  The topic caused a resonance that can not but rejoice.  For him, I received almost all the cons in karma that I have.  This suggests that people really care about the situation in the country and the attitude of residents to the situation.  Once again, I am convinced that Habr is a society of minded people.  Not so, as often happens in such articles, and without a small holivar, the initiators of which, however, behaved quite correctly. <br>  Unfortunately, many dialogues came down to the issue of street cleanliness and money.  I want to note that there are many places on the streets are not at all dirty because people litter (there are almost no such people among my friends), but because there are no rubbish bins, there is no separation between the path and the lawn (and sometimes there is no difference between them) and all the dirt in the time of the rains is washed out on the road, all the curbs are older than my grandfather ‚Äî all are broken and turned up and many other reasons that do not depend on ordinary citizens.  The issue of street cleanliness is secondary in this case.  Of course, the financial side matters.  Without a doubt, the standard of living will be higher there.  Even if we compare the default city with a city in Siberia, there is a significant difference.  But in Russia you can achieve financial well-being, albeit at the cost of great efforts. <br>  Nevertheless, a huge number of strong and wise words were heard, there were some thoughts that I missed thinking about this before.  People argued and often agreed.  Such topics should periodically appear so that you can pour out your righteous anger and once again raise some urgent issues.  Water wears away a stone.  Maybe sometime this will give fruit. <br>  It would probably be implausible if I said that I was unequivocally determined, after reading this article, with my choice.  I am not so categorical that once and for all I decide to stay here and fight for an unknown future, which, according to many, is bleak.  And I don‚Äôt know the world and people so well to decide to leave now and forever, there were such tips too. <br>  I love my city - almost the only thing I've seen so far.  I like a lot, but I don‚Äôt like it even more.  I'm not sure that I can change this, but by moving, you can ‚Äúsolve‚Äù one problem and meet another.  For me, a serious obstacle is the lack of friends.  Living alone for several years, trying to find those close to me in spirit, and building relationships (even if not years, but months), losing direct contact with those who are dear to me now is difficult. <br>  I stay - this is my decision.  Now I will not intentionally look for opportunities to move.  I do not deny this possibility, I do not think that the move is a betrayal and that, living somewhere in the outback and supporting the work of the Internet, I will bring Russia more benefits than working in Finland.  Soon I will be here and I will try to do everything in my power to make the world a little bit better. <br>  &lt;What did I want to say with this post?  Thank you all.  I'm staying&gt; </div>
