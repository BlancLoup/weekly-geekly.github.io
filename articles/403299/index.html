Intel first held this forum 20 years ago, in 1997.  At that time, the Intel Developer Forum (IDF) had a relatively small scale.  The first time he was held in Palm Springs (California, USA), then moved to San Francisco.  In addition, the forum was held at different times in other countries and cities, including Tokyo, Beijing, Moscow. <br><br>  Each year, IDF collected a large number of technicians who discussed Intel products and developments that were somehow related to the corporation.  Sometimes Intel presented some new items that it considered important.  Now, according to company representatives, the time has come to cancel IDF, since all the efforts of employees are aimed at developing new markets that are not related to hardware.  Therefore, the forum format itself is not suitable for the presentation of most new Intel products. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Representatives of the company say that, instead of IDF, other events are likely to be held, their range will be expanded, but the subject, on the contrary, is narrowed.  But what exactly it will be for the event, not reported.

      ‚ÄúProbably, when it comes to Intel, you imagine a company that manufactures processors for desktops, laptops and servers.  But we must not stop there.  Our team consists of inventors, researchers who move the world forward.  Over the past few years, the company has managed to become a major international provider of solutions for data centers and hundreds of millions of ‚Äúsmart‚Äù devices.  We are making new products on the edge of the possibilities of modern technology, providing assistance to companies and individuals in the movement to new heights, ‚Äù- says the statement of Intel. <br><br>  This year the IDF forum was to be held in San Francisco.  But on the event page now <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/intel-developer-forum-idf/san-francisco/2017/idf-2017-san-francisco.html">you can see</a> confirmation of the cancellation of this and all IDF forums in the future. <br><br>  Regarding information about Intel products, the company stated the following: ‚ÄúIntel has quite a lot of resources available on intel.com, including the Resource and Design Center with documentation, software and tools for designers, engineers and developers.  As usual, our customers, partners and developers can ask questions to Intel representatives. ‚Äù <br><br>  Unfortunately, the company's web resources can not always become a full-fledged replacement of direct communication with chip makers and other products from Intel with IDF.  But, apparently, nothing can be done - the forum has been canceled and the corporation is not going to reconsider its decision. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403299/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403299/</a></p>
