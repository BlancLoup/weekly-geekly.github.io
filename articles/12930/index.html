  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why last.fm?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <strong>For listeners:</strong> <strong><br></strong> <br>  * If you have unlimited and fairly high-speed Internet access, you can simply forget that you need to download, search or buy music from somewhere.  For every mood you can find the right music for free.  It is under any and yours.  You get a radio station that broadcasts music that is exactly your idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe beautiful.  Or the parameters that you decide to set today and now. <br>  * If your channel on the Internet does not yet allow you to listen to the radio at 128 kbps, the problem of finding music to your taste is much easier.  Many songs can be downloaded directly from last.fm, and many others you will find links there.  And links to shops, including, if we are talking about the music of those groups and musicians who are still confident that they should pay for low quality music too. <br>  * If you cannot even download every track that would be interesting to listen to, then last.fm will tell you which names and albums you should look for in your friends and in music stores.  And with very high probability that you will be offered to last.fm, you will like it. <br>  * Naturally, you can find not only the music itself.  But also people who are close to you in musical tastes.  And very often it turns out that this spiritual closeness is not limited to musical tastes.  Well, you should not forget about the possibility of finding a person in your city who is listening to that very rare single of your favorite band that you have already tired of looking for the last couple of years. <br><br>  <strong>For musicians:</strong> <br><br>  * You don‚Äôt have to wait until there is a label that deigns to release a CD of your band or until a disc already released at one end of the world gets to your fan at the other end of the world.  You can upload your music to last.fm and it will be available to the whole world in a day.  Of course, you can always just put mp3 on your site.  Or find netlable, releasing similar music, which even will be engaged in some kind of its promotion.  But the audience of any site of a group or net-label is much more limited than the one that is already available today as part of last.fm.  And last.fm is just starting to grow. <br>  * You do not want to give the music completely free, putting the mp3 in free access, but at the same time you like the idea that your music can be easily found according to the criteria of similarity to other music or styles?  And no one forced to give users the opportunity to download music.  You can only make listening to the track through the last.fm application possible, you can even limit free listening on the site itself to just 30 seconds, and even such a small piece can be enough for the listener to fall in love with your music. <br>  * And do not forget that last.fm music is just 128 kbps mp3.  This quality is usually enough to get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe music, but it is unlikely to really affect sales.  The person who buys the disc hopes for higher quality and much more.

      <strong>For music lovers and fans:</strong> <br>  Want to help the same as you find the right music?  Would you mind supporting your favorite musician?  Easy peasy: <br><br>  * Set yourself last.fm application and listen to your favorite music.  In any quantities, from one track once in a lifetime to always, everywhere and without ceasing. <br>  * Find the most beloved musician and tell him about last.fm, or rather persuade him (or her) to make their music accessible via last.fm, if only for radio listeners. <br>  * As soon as you can find the music on the site and somehow hear it, at least within those 30 seconds, go to the artist / album / track or song page and click tag this artist / album / track, or whatever you have written on your language.  Now add some tags related to this music.  From the name of the city where the musician was born, to the style in which, as you thought, it was precisely this composition that was written, or to the mood, time of day, weather and time of year when it is better to listen to such music.  Tomorrow, someone will definitely decide to listen to the morning music from Taganrog or just a modest glitch, and the tags you put to him will help him in the search. <br><br>  <strong>For labels:</strong> <br><br>  * Last.fm was created including as a tool for selling and popularizing music.  With sales through last.fm itself, everything is not so simple, as long as it is necessary mainly to refer to other stores, but I haven‚Äôt yet seen the best tool to bring music to the right ears.  Of course, if you release Britney Spears albums, then you need radio and TV.  But with any music designed not for each and every last.fm would be simply irreplaceable.  I do not specifically spread at this point, just start to understand and, I am sure, you will find 50 more ways to increase the number of potential and not only buyers of the music you produce, which I have not yet thought of. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/12930/">https://habr.com/ru/post/12930/</a></p>
