  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to reduce PPC (pay-per-click) by 30% in 20 minutes</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello again!  Today I want to talk about buying traffic to your portal.  I do not have fundamental knowledge in SEO, but I allowed myself to publish an article on this topic, because it seems to me that it could benefit people, especially directors and SEO-specialists of start-up projects.  And for a director of a start-up with a limited budget, this trick can be very useful, as it allows you to save money, while maintaining the results of the PPC campaign.  You can use it yourself, or pass this information to your SEO specialist (if any) so that he can successfully apply this method.  I got acquainted with him in the course of intensive work on my last start-up project (the idea, of course, is not mine, but I had to deal with key filtering, so I know how it works). <br><br>  This information has so far been considered a little secret, but do not misunderstand me.  There is nothing “super-duper-secret” in this ploy.  In fact, Google itself recommends using it.  But the fact is that nobody does it! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Well, let's start ... <br>  In the "trick" you need to use the so-called negative keywords (stop words).  Negative keywords are words that, after being typed in a search engine, your ad will NOT appear.  One of the most common words is “free.”  If you sell something that could theoretically be free, using “free” as a stop word, you can prevent your ads from displaying when users are looking for something free.  For example, if you sell any software, and NOT for free. <br>  The question is: how to make a perfect list of negative keywords?  There are two main actions: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      1. <b>Use the Google Keyword Tool.</b> <br>  Choose your keywords using this Google tool and highlight potential negative keywords.  Let's say you offer free reviews.  Here is a sample list of words that I would add to the negative keywords segment for a portal offering free reviews: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/871/2f4/bf3/8712f4bf38d1e7b86c7759bb55acfc77.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Obviously, I do not need the words: “newspaper”, “review”, “market review”, “price review” or “5800 review” (which I have no idea, despite the fact that more than 6,000 requests for it ). <br>  As you understand, this is only the first page of keyword variations.  You can find thousands of other negative keywords if you continue scrolling in search of variations of your main keyword. <br>  Perhaps you are thinking: “If someone wants to find reviews of local companies, and he comes across a“ price review, ”why would he click on the latter?  The answer is: most people click, and then think.  And it costs you money. <br><br>  2. <b>Use AdWords Reports at Google</b> <br>  From your AdWords profile, go to Reports&gt; Create Report.  Then select Query Performance Report: <br>  Choose date range and view keywords for your entire campaign. <br>  This report will show you the actual terms by which people search for you. <br>  Most advertisers use the broad match option, which means they trust Google to decide if the search query is relevant to one of their keywords. <br>  But, looking at the report that you created using Google AdWords, you will see ACTUAL search terms that trigger your ads, and transfer budget-damaging words to a list of negative keywords. <br>  If you do it for the first time, instead of 20 minutes it may take a couple of hours, but most likely it will be your most useful two hours. <br>  Waiting for comments <br>  Taisiya <br><br>  update by comments: <br>  I repeat once again, I do not pretend to some kind of professionalism and the proud name of an SEO specialist;  I wrote an article to share my knowledge in this regard, but what if this information is useful to someone ... <br>  Those who have written comments are right in that the SEO technique I described has nothing to do with it, since this is a PPC campaign, which, as it turned out, does not apply to SEO.  Well, this proves my words that I’m not a professional in SEO, and the article is intended more for marketing professionals, to which I consider myself ... <br>  ￼ </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78517/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78517/</a></p>
