The idea that is described in it seemed sound to me at half past one in spite of the fact that I did not conduct any serious research on payback and realizability.  There are also no pictures with a ready device under the cut, due to the lack of such in nature <br><br>  Probably, many of us faced the problem of the quality of information broadcast by the central TV channels.  Most normal people disregard the ‚Äúbox‚Äù because of the endless stream of low-quality propaganda.  However, for some reason unknown to me, older people for the most part do not filter this stream, and take everything seriously.

      In the end, one day you will learn from parents about burning gay hearts, urine treatment and the coming of the fascists to power in Ukraine.  Stay first and don‚Äôt change the channel. <br><br>  As practice shows, buying a smart TV with a hard drive full of thousands of favorite movies, TV shows and plots of Discovery does not solve the problem of watching the evening news.  Television is convenient in that it gives a certain variety, inaccessible to the playlist, and at the same time does not require any active actions.  And most importantly - it solves the problem of choice. <br><br>  So, our task is to gradually, without changing any user's habits, and using only technical means to create alternative sources of information for him, thereby correcting the one-sided presentation of information on TV. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The most logical solution in this situation seemed to me to broadcast the "necessary" news at a certain time instead of broadcasting a particular channel.  To comply with the law - all this must occur within the same household.  Let's leave for a while the question of the origin of media content, and focus on the technical aspects. <br><br>  Directly broadcast video can be run from any android tv box, of which thousands on ebay.  The next news release should be cached shortly before the start of the broadcast, and at a given time forcibly disconnect the TV from the broadcast network and broadcast its own TV signal. <br><br>  It all depends on how the TV receiver is connected to the broadcast network: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Conventional coaxial cable, analog</b> - the most commonly used option in the regions. </li><li>  <b>A standard coaxial cable, a digit through a set</b> - <b>top box</b> - setting a scart \ rgb \ hdmi connection into the gap. </li><li>  <b>Normal coaxial cable, the figure directly, or through the CI \ CI + card</b> - the most difficult option, but quite rare </li><li>  <b>An unencrypted digit over ethernet</b> is ideal, but even more rare than CI \ CI + </li></ul><br><br>  The greatest interest for us is the analog broadcasting.  Immediately managed to find a lot of converters VGA-&gt; AV, but still it is slightly wrong.  In addition, the ideal converter should have an external interface to control the broadcast frequency, but such glands could not be found. <br>  But just such a functionality was found in the old satellite receiver Openbox F300, which suggests that there is no technical difficulty in the implementation of this issue. <br><br>  With the number through the console is still easier.  Boxing is put in the ‚Äúgap‚Äù of the connection between the TV and the console.  There are two relatively complex tasks - the implementation of the connection "in the gap" and getting the number of the active channel from the console.  It is possible, in some cases, it will be easier to reverse the firmware of the device and make a software injection of the stream. <br><br>  Well, the digit on ethernet - from the complex technical issues only the synchronization of the stream format.  Since it changes quite rarely, the setting is actually one-time. <br><br>  In general, from the technical side, the implementation is not too complicated.  The cost of the finished device offhand should not exceed 130-150 dollars. <br><br>  Separately talk about the production of media content.  It is quite difficult for me to judge the cost of doing such work.  Perhaps there are people involved in the creation of independent TV channels.  As far as I understand, for them the optimal payment format is a subscription.  And if so - a solvent audience is needed.  Therefore, instead of long reasoning, there will be an ordinary poll. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/213757/">https://habr.com/ru/post/213757/</a></p>
