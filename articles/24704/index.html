  <section class="page js-page"><h1>14 principles of management E. Deming. Introduction</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the next few days, I intend to introduce you to the fourteen principles of Williams Edwards Deming's management. <a name="habracut"></a>  In the science of management there is an amazing tradition, founded by Henri Fayol, to formulate the principles of company management in fourteen points.  A. Fayol, a French mining engineer, was the first to formulate his 14 principles, which are considered the foundation of their science as management bore; same.  About how so different principles, voiced at intervals of decades, can express the same deep thought, I will explain in conclusion.  Now take a quick look at Deming's 14 principles. <br><br>  Here are the fourteen principles of E. Deming's management, which are applicable everywhere - in small and large organizations, in the service sector and in production: <br><br>  1. Achieve the consistency of the goal - continuous improvement of products and services. <br>  2. Adopt a new philosophy. <br>  3. End the addiction to quality control. <br>  4. Put an end to the practice of evaluating and selecting suppliers based on price only. <br>  5. Constantly and continuously improve the system of production and service. <br>  6. Enter on-the-job training. <br>  7. Establish leadership. <br>  8. Banish fear. <br>  9. Break down barriers between units. <br>  10. Discard slogans, appeals, and goal setting for workers related to productivity levels. <br>  11. a) Eliminate the quantitative norms and tasks for workers in the workshop.  Replace them with leadership.  b) Exclude management by objectives.  Stop managing by numbers and quantitative results.  Replace it with leadership. <br>  12. a) Break down barriers that deprive workers of their right to be proud of their skills.  b) Break down barriers that deprive managers and engineers of their right to be proud of their skills. <br>  13. Establish a broad program of learning and self-improvement. <br>  14. Make everyone in the company work together on fundamental changes.

      In fact, the overwhelming majority of companies in this country or elsewhere suffer from the same diseases, and in this sense they are not unique.  The pathos is that those 0.5% of companies that have made these, in effect, banal truths and appeals part of their system, i.e.  those companies that are cured of general infection become Nike, Toyota or P &amp; G. <br><br>  Our offices are filled with people who do not enjoy what they do.  When the economy gets richer, when the shortage of products disappears and overproduction comes in its place, a world of similar goods, then, oddly enough, money becomes less and less obvious incentive for work, for the involvement of workers in the business of the company.  Today, no matter whether it is good or bad, more and more young people appear, who, even before they get their first job, already have a premium mobile phone, a car and a full wardrobe.  You, as an employer, do not lure them with a two thousand dollar salary, if you - intentionally or not - practice management with the help of goals, which actually means management with the help of fear, practice annual (quarterly, monthly) certifications, somehow camouflaged, remove yourself all responsibility for the present and the future, and in general - I want to call things by their names - unable to manage.  This is the essence: the problem of most companies is the inability of top management to manage. <br><br>  A. Morita, one of the leaders of SONY, once said about the founder of the company Masaru Ibuka: <br><br>  Essentially, the story of SONY is the story of a group of people seeking to help Ibuka realize his dreams. <br><br>  If you are a business owner, wake up and think.  If your dream is money, be prepared to lose everything.  If you are used to playing dictator or Carabas Barabas, get ready to be alone.  Stop practicing what the army has taught you.  Forget about your strict father.  If your company is sick, admit that you are a loser who you have not yet understood, and listen to me. <br><br>  Tomorrow we will talk about consistency of purpose. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24704/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24704/</a></p>
