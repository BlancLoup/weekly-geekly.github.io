      I think many of you at least once received (or know / heard about schemes for obtaining) a free software license (shareware).  Someone sent bug reports, suggestions and wishes, really creative thoughts and received the mercy of the developers, someone participated in some campaigns (starting from improving the quality of software, ending with competitions for the best promotional verse).  Often from ‚Äújust interesting‚Äù, sometimes because the software is really good, needed, but at the moment there is no money to purchase it - why not work as a tester in the hope of a legal key? <br><br>  The idea came to me when I once again paid attention, as a familiar Novosibirsk citizen (hello, Novosibirsk!) Constantly comes into contact with software developers around the world, really contributes to the development of the product and receives the cherished key (or does not receive).  Each time he made contact (sometimes waiting for a full-fledged reunion of minds lasted six months, sometimes several days), he decided which side to go in (developers are not marketers, they do not always see bonuses), spud, got his way. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Smoothly to the point</b> <br><br>  So, we have two subjects interested in each other - the User, the Software Provider (meaning not only the developers, but also the circle of resellers, who also have their own interest).  The first is interested (need / would be useful / just needed) to get a free license (perhaps in some way limited, the main thing is enough for your needs).  The second one (even if we take large suppliers) gets a number of positive bonuses - promo, product improvement (large vendors have enough testers and ‚Äúcreatives‚Äù, of course) and many pleasant moments for small shareware products that seek to improve their level. <br><br>  If we consider the connection "Freeloader" - Supplier in the wild, then this is a lot of problems for the user, and therefore the minimum response for the advertiser.  The user can not always make his way through the support bringing interesting points, the user needs time to establish a contact, the user does not know in advance whether he will receive the key. <br><br>  There is a project to create an intermediary portal between these two groups.  Suppliers are registered in the system, specify the requirements for users who want to get a license, in turn, they receive feedback in the form in which they want.  Feel the idea?  Does it make sense to develop?  I like the fact that it‚Äôs not so much the feeling that all this can be monetized without any problems. <br><br>  <b>What do you suggest, monsieur?</b> <br><br>  A well-developed project (the layout in Habr√© only describes the idea), the registered domain GetFreeLicense.ru, hosting, monetization and product promotion (including active negotiations / sales with small and large software vendors).  Accordingly, 50% of [potential] revenues from the project are ready to give to habroops who will take up the project in the format of a portal.  Any discussions / suggestions are welcome. <br><br>  Ps.  I apologize for the lack of colorful illustrations that always attract.  I hope the topic will seem interesting and not "dry."  I am pleased to hear any reasoned criticism. <br><br>  Regards and best regards. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/52156/">https://habr.com/ru/post/52156/</a></p>
