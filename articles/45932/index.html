  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Summarizing the experience of the three stages</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Thanks to readers of previous articles for their interest.  Thanks to your motivation, I still dare to continue this topic.  So. <br><br>  In the first three editions, I wrote about how trips and survival campaigns took place.  At the end of the articles I cited the experience gained in these campaigns. <br>  Now, as promised, I am writing a general article in which I combine the experience of three survival trips.  What is listed here are those things and entities that people have come to (not me alone) in conditions of extreme minimalism. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>A knife is a very important thing</b> for survival.  If you have a knife - the probability of salvation increases many times.  Everything is done with a knife - it is cut, chopped, rummaged, hunted, eaten, sharpened, etc.  I have long researched the question of what a survival knife should be.  Checked knowledge in campaigns, in practice.  And he came to this conclusion: the knife should be inconsistent, medium in size, as simple and reliable as possible.  Forget about garbage with all sorts of personal belongings in the handle, these knives are scattered into pieces even with ordinary marching exploitation. <br><br>  <b>Food</b> for the normal functioning of the body needs much less than we used to eat.  Food wildlife can really give a lot, especially in summer and autumn.  In the city we eat really more than the body needs.  And in general, the last thing you need to think about food in an extreme situation.  If there is nothing, then the feeling of hunger disappears completely on the second or third day.  Without food, a person is able to act for 2-3 weeks.

      Explore <b>edible and inedible plants, berries, herbs</b> and other gifts of nature in the area where you have to survive.  As a rule, there is a lot of food in nature; you just need to know where to look for it. <br><br>  <b>Polyethylene is a very useful item</b> for survival.  Polyethylene protects you from precipitation and wind if you wrap yourself in it.  He lets in the heat of the fire and at the same time does not release the warm air.  It can be used to collect rainwater or dew.  Transparent polyethylene can be used to make a solar watermaker. <br><br>  <b>Several small bonfires</b> are better than one big one.  Such assertions are often found in the literature on survival, but they are largely ignored.  I responsibly affirm that this is very useful advice.  If you are alone, make at least 2 campfires. <br><br>  <b>Hammock.</b>  The hammock has several advantages: it can replace a karemat, and at the same time takes up much less space.  In a hammock, there is less chance of being caught by all sorts of crawling reptiles, such as snakes, spiders, rats, ants, skalpendra, langolera, etc.  Being suspended at a height of 3-4 meters, a hammock will save you already from many large predators.  You can sleep in a hammock and be heated with two small fires on the sides at a distance of about one and a half meters.  The firewood stacks right under the hammock, so that the maintenance of the fire does not force you to get out of it.  The entire lower surface of the hammock is warmed by the warmth of the fire, and it is very comfortable to sleep.  But you need to be sure that the firewood under you will not catch fire, otherwise you will not be up to the cold. <br><br>  <b>Duty.</b>  Without night duty, no one will be able to rest.  The fire will go out, and everyone will wake up from the cold.  It is recommended to break all night into 3-4 stages for 2-3 hours.  Time passes quickly.  The duty officer manages to dry all his belongings by the fire.  Watching the fire in the quiet of the night soothes great.  Keeping evenly a bonfire, the attendant ensures a peaceful, warm sleep for everyone else.  And all sleep better, knowing that you will not catch fire, because  someone is following this.  The duty officer also controls all kinds of dangers and, if necessary, can quickly wake everyone up. <br><br>  If you have a supply of food - take care of the inaccessibility of wild animals.  Hang on a rope or have the guard on duty.  Do not keep food with you if you are going to sleep - rats, mice, ants, dogs, etc.  will not stop the fact of your still presence. <br><br>  <b>Relaxation.</b>  Fatigue and absent-mindedness - this is very bad in conditions where important decisions have to be made.  In the conditions of real survival, this can be vital.  Therefore, rest and comfort is not a nobility, not a manifestation of weakness, but a necessary means of maintaining clarity of thought and the ability to make adequate decisions.  If there is an opportunity - relax and take care of comfort. <br><br>  <b>Flint.</b>  Great tool for breeding fire.  The essence is simple - with a knife at an angle of 45 degrees you make intensive movements along the rod of the flint, at the end of the trajectory you have, depending on the skill, from a heap of sparks to a real small short-term flame.  The only negative is some damage to the knife blade.  Instead of a knife, you can quite successfully use the reverse side of the blade or the sharp edge of a broken stone.  The method is very good, perhaps the most immediate and effective of all available.  Flint is not afraid of mechanical damage, takes up little space and is durable in service.  However, some types of flint from water are covered with a thin layer of oxide, this means that the long-term storage of flint should be sealed. <br><br>  The priority of life-important entities is: <br>  1 - Water.  Without water, you will not be able to act in 2-3 days and die in 5-7 days. <br>  2 - Shelter.  If conditions are harsh, then without shelter from the cold and wind, you will lose power very quickly. <br>  3 - Fire.  Keeping warm is just as important as finding shelter.  Also on the fire to boil water so as not to get poisoned and cook food.  Therefore, it is important to learn how to quickly make a fire. <br><br>  These items may be interchanged depending on the circumstances.  Everything else is optional and depends on the situation, but if you have these 3 entities, then you are almost saved. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/45932/">https://habr.com/ru/post/45932/</a></p>
