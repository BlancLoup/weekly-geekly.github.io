Someone lives to the end of his days and in bed remembers how happy he lived life, someone dies in world and not very global catastrophes, and someone dies from a gangster hand. <br><br>  Gangsters are different: both legitimate and no.  Let's admit it. <br>  Sometimes you, thinking that you will earn a lot of money on your startup, you get into debt ... But what if the startup did not bring money, and <s>ass</s> pay is close ?! <br>  And it is even worse: you get into debt, you believe people, and then, when it‚Äôs already late and it‚Äôs like, you realize that you were just framed and thrown out. <br><br>  I will lead this story on my own observations and experience.  Please do not ask where I am, how I am and how I plunged into the story.

      In the post there is absolutely no advertising and the links that I quote are made for clarification.  I myself have no relation to these sites. <br><br>  Interesting?  Then welcome under cat. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  When? </h4><br><br>  Very rhetorical question.  Most likely, you yourself will understand.  The main thing is to understand it a little earlier before digging a hole in the forest or lying in a hospital without a kidney and with broken legs and arms. <br><br>  <i>I understood my situation when I got to the documents and interpreted them for a couple of weeks.</i>  <i>In fact, it turned out that I did not receive the money (even in cash).</i>  <i>The startup did not belong to anything, but what was supposedly bought belonged to the investor or his firms.</i>  <i>I did not receive cash and any kind of salary.</i>  <i>And I spent about six months already.</i>  <i>Attempts to solve this peacefully came out in threats and even a little worse, in the form of managing my time, and also promises of death, lost health and freedom in the form of slavery.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>When I received confirmation of the latter, watching me bargain, I decided it was time.</i>  <i>I wish you not to observe this.</i> <br><br><h4>  Where? </h4><br><br>  Oh, this is quite an enchanting question.  If you have a large amount, experience and brains, then you can go to England or the States, Canada or Australia.  True, it will not work for a long time, but there are certain legalization schemes. <br>  Climbing on the Internet, you can easily find them. <br><br>  <i>I will give an example:</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>Czech.</b></i> <i><br></i>  <i>The country is not emigration.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>Ways of legalization:</b> work, business, study.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>Language:</b> Czech, English.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>IT job:</b> very much needed specialists.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>Business: the</b> foundation of the company is not big, but for the regions of Russia it is not a small amount.</i>  <i>Automatic receipt of a business visa.</i>  <i>Now tightened the rules for this type.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>Study:</b> education is free in Czech.</i>  <i>You can calmly go to study.</i>  <i>The main thing to pass the exam in Czech.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>Legalization path:</b> period of residence.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The approximate amount to help you move there and enroll (this amount was named to me): 1000 euros.</i> <br><br>  However, imagine that you have neither the time nor the money.  Well, if you have no money at all, then I can hardly help you. <br><br>  <i>I will say this: I had a month.</i>  <i>Work with a salary of 30 thousand rubles (well, and such a sum is in the hands), and the absolute absence of Zagran.</i>  <i>passports</i>  <i>How I left is the topic of the next question.</i> <br><br>  So, if you do not have a lot of money, huge connections and stand in about my situation, then it will probably be easier for you to go to a country with a visa-free regime and make a visa to another country right from there, as I did. <br><br>  There is already a somewhat controversial question where to go.  I found a pretty good list <a href="http://www.travel.ru/formalities/visa/visafree/">here</a> . <br><br>  I will say right away: it is best to choose not ‚Äúcool‚Äù countries, but something like Asia - it will be easier for you to live and provide for yourself, pay for an apartment, etc. <br><br>  <i>Quite an interesting example to note: I have a friend who lives in Thailand on the border with Cambodia for 8.5 thousand rubles a month, renting an apartment.</i>  <i>Does not shy, but lives.</i> <br><br>  Naturally, living in the resort towns is more expensive, but here‚Äôs an example: I lived in Asia in a resort town and for 30 thousand a month I rented a beautiful apartment for 1 km.  from the beach for 9.5 thousand and at the same time lived well, could afford to buy brandy, walk in the evenings.  True, I also worked ... <br><br>  How to decide?  Go to the forum of the country that you like, see how much the average amount of renting an apartment costs and multiply by 2.2 - this is the amount you need per month for a good life. <br><br>  Also read how people live and what to do in the country is impossible, what are the foundations, etc. <br><br>  <i>Where I lived drugs could lead to the loss of life, although the Korean, whom I met when I was traveling by bus from the airport, tried to sell me ecstasy for free, "because I am a good person."</i> <br><br><h4>  How? </h4><br><br>  In most cities of Russia there is such a thing as a branch of the Federal Migration Service of Russia, of which very few people know, and where you can do abroad.  very fast with minimal cost.  Yes, and old passports are made there. <br><br>  <i>I did overseas.</i>  <i>for 1000 rubles surcharge for 2 weeks.</i>  <i>In 1500, it was possible to do it in a week and a half, but I was "shocked."</i>  <i>Plus a thousand more - standard payment to the bank.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>A foreign country can make a new one in the Russian embassy in another country, if the last one is over.</i> <br><br>  Collect a minimum of things.  On the cheapest plane tickets in the baggage can not be dragged more than 20 kg., Otherwise you will have to pay extra for overload.  If you smoke, take 10 packs of cigarettes per person (no longer possible, otherwise a commercial batch): these are only cheap Russian cigarettes, and in many countries the cost of a pack is two cans of almost the most expensive beer. <br>  If the country is warm, then buy shorts and pants and more - this thing ends the fastest. <br><br>  Don't tell anyone where you eat.  Try not to say this even to close friends and, if possible, relatives. <br><br>  <i>Enough people knew about my county, but where I actually knew was only 3 people.</i>  <i>The rest had to lie that I had a new business trip.</i> <br><br>  Find the remote job that will support you.  In today's IT world, this is not a big problem. <br><br>  <i>I found remote work in two days for the same amount plus interest.</i> <br><br>  Try not to promise anyone else, otherwise they will start looking for you (I think, they will be looking for you) not only those people from whom you are hiding.  If there is an opportunity, let those people who have a chance to call will know about your problems, but this is not a ‚Äúsnotty little man,‚Äù but a stable and strong person. <br><br>  Change all your nicknames and passwords, set up mail collectors, erase everything you can from the Internet that can somehow connect you with other people.  Buy a temporary SIM card in order to use it before buying a local one.  Then throw it away with a pure soul. <br><br>  Save money up to the county.  Do not celebrate your county, do not meet with anyone before the county, it is desirable to ensure that no one escorts you at all. <br>  Buy the cheapest tickets, even if your flight will be crooked. <br><br>  <i>I flew 25 hours, when the standard flight path is 12 hours.</i>  <i>And if you count with all the roads, then in 35 hours of travel I slept only 2 hours on the plane.</i> <br><br>  Collect medications: in the majority, medications in another country in another language that you can hardly understand.  God forbid you make a mistake in buying this or that medicine.  Yes, and it is expensive to root there ... <br><br>  Take with you all the documents, bills, if any.  Do not leave real estate or movable: copy them to their relatives. <br><br>  And one more tip: take along your favorite non-perishable foods, such as tea and coffee.  Just a note. <br><br>  Agree on renting an apartment.  In most cases, the lease does not mean anything or will cause you additional problems.  Take off for an approximate duration of your stay.  For example, from a year - so many bureaucratic issues are being resolved.  Also note that you will have to pay for the first month and the guarantee amount - usually it is the same as the month of rent. <br><br><h4>  It's time to fly </h4><br><br>  Here you take off.  Do not tell anyone why (stupid, but there are such).  Do not be nervous - take it as a new round of your life.  In the passport control say that you eat on vacation.  Usually they no longer ask questions.  Try not to carry anything metal with you: I was hesitated to take off the belt, and my pants are holding onto me badly. <br><br>  Smokers: take a pack of cigarettes with you - I had enough for 35 hours. <br>  Communicate with people, ask for help if required.  If you are in another country, then speak English - you will understand, most likely. <br>  Take a minimum of money with you: 500 rubles was enough for me.  The rest is on Visa or MasterCard.  At the airport, you can withdraw without commission in local currency with conversion through the dollar.  Also, in Duty Free you can pay by card: two energy companies cost me 2 euros. <br>  Do not buy food at the airport - the planes are well fed (I ate in the third plane). <br>  If you need to fly through another country and you are asked whether you need a transfer or a window, then take the transfer: it‚Äôs better to spend two hours in the duty-free zone than going through customs control again.  Do not be rude, but defend your rights, although this is unlikely to happen.  Do not hesitate, but have a measure.  Do not expect that everything will do for you or you will find people like you: just do it. <br><br>  If you can‚Äôt reach your landlord for some reason (this was mine), then go to any person and ask for help.  You probably will help and give a call.  Pay back to the person (I went over with the "payment", as I learned later, giving 50 local rubles for the perfect three minutes call - you can talk a lot with this amount).  Get to know the local Russians (for example, on the same forum), but don‚Äôt say why you are here, and don‚Äôt offer monetary assistance - you‚Äôll probably be deceived and will be used (these are Russians, alas).  Find maps and local stores - for starters, this is enough for you. <br><br>  Contact Russian embassies of other countries.  Describe your stories, also contact representatives of the Immigration Lawyers Association.  Describe your stories without names (except yours, just do not include your last name).  They answer quickly. <br><br>  <i>One lawyer offered me free help and within a month he arranged for me to meet at the local embassy of another country.</i>  <i>I received additional help and explanations.</i>  <i>About 3 months my case was investigated and after that I was given a positive decision on the relocation to another country.</i> <br><br>  Do not miss the past: the first few weeks you will have memories and desires to return - do not give in. <br><br>  Live and enjoy life, do not forget to work. <br><br>  I wish you not to get into this situation.  Good luck. <br><br>  <b>UDP</b> : UFO moved the topic to "I resent." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125091/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125091/</a></p>
