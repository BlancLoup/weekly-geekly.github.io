  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Caller ID in a virtual PBX: there, here and back</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Everyone is well aware that a virtual PBX helps manage communication between employees and customers.  But at the same time there are a lot of nuances, for example: what phone number does the employee or client see when the call goes through a virtual PBX?  Today, we will not delve into the theorizing about the capabilities and charms of the cloud telecommunications platform, but focus on the real project that our team faced just last month. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d9/d05/8c3/8d9d058c32e64192835a400f739909b0.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As usual, the company wanted to get a convenient and profitable virtual PBX with the ability to connect employees, both on stationary and mobile phones, but the customer put forward a specific requirement: both customers and employees had to see the required number of the interlocutor when they called.  And if everything is simple with clients - the manager has to see the real number of the subscriber on his cell phone, then feedback was required much more difficult.

      In connection with the specifics of the activity, the company published announcements with different phone numbers for each individual area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Krasnodar Territory (although such a scheme can certainly be useful throughout Russia).  The idea was that the real estate agency assigned to each area its manager with a specific mobile phone number.  It turns out that not a faceless organization works with clients, but a specific kind manager who builds a personal relationship with each client.  However, in the interests of the management, all calls should go through the PBX - with the ability to record, redirect other amenities of modern telecommunications technology - and not on the personal cellular of each realtor. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Caller ID - there </h3><br>  The question of organizing the identification of the client number on the cellular phone of the realtor has already been resolved both in Hive and in many other virtual PBXs available on the market.  The principle is simple: when a call is received to one of the phone numbers published in advertisements, it is transmitted to the virtual PBX, and inside Hive is forwarded according to the established rules - to the internal number of the subscriber, which can be linked to the real federal number or connected via SIP, and also implemented as a virtual IP-SIM.  Competent implementation of caller ID allows you to show exactly the client‚Äôs contact on your mobile phone. <br><br>  By the way, in this case, the client chose our virtual SIMs, because with a large volume of calls it turned out to be more profitable to pay a monthly fee for each SIM-card and receive calls for free than to pay for connections minute by minute.  In addition, such a scheme potentially allows you to encrypt a phone number to reach the client only from a working SIM card, and when trying to call from a personal SIM, to make an offer to bypass the company, the realtor received the message ‚Äúthe number was incorrectly dialed‚Äù. <br><br>  An additional nuance in organizing direct AON is the possibility of using the numbers of other communication providers.  Given that, as an operator, it is easier to offer our numbering capacities, the Hive capabilities allow us to connect any numbering capacities via the SIP channel, for example, already rented from another player.  In this case, the Caller ID is transmitted to our virtual PBX and is transmitted within the network to subscribers - both with IP connection and with redirection. <br><br><h3>  Caller ID - back </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8cb/33c/015/8cb33c015b344453a0d6e76b12f5a854.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But in this case, the company was not enough for managers to get contacts for customer feedback.  The customer also wanted the client to also see the manager‚Äôs phone number when he called from the company (that is, through a virtual PBX).  Unlike the organizations in which you receive all calls from the same common corporate number and have to guess who called you, the company wanted to personalize the communication, so that the client, first, understood that Ivan Ivanovich called him, and the second could call back to a specific number and get directly to his manager, not even suspecting that the call goes through the PBX. <br><br>  As we have said, the real estate agency advertised and assigned certain numbers to each regional manager.  In order to determine exactly this number when calling the customer, we configured special individual caller ID parameters for each manager in Hive.  As a result, when calling from a specific IP-SIM, a virtual PBX Hive always issues a phone number assigned to the manager as the caller ID, just like the one used in the ads.  In principle, no one bothers us also to group incoming calls and always show them the same caller ID, even if Ivan Ivanovich got sick and Boris Borisovich calls - so that the client does not have confusion with numbers and there is a single contact with the company. <br><br><h3>  There and back - a universal approach </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/28a/0eb/299/28a0eb2994b041f4a7b482add6f1780e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Using the above two schemes already implemented <a href="http://hive.zeonpbx.ru/">in Hive</a> , you can take the best from two worlds at once - combining clear centralization of calls, controlling employees and optimizing expenses with personalized communication and using any number of personal numbers of employees, while retaining their company identity.  <a href="http://www.iptelefon.su/">We have already tried</a> this scheme in practice, and you can now order a trial access to Hive and evaluate the possibilities of flexible work with caller ID as applied to your business model.
