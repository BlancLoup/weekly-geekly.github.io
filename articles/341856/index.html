      The project is quite specific and I was shocked by the number of buyers for the beginning - I never thought that there are more than 5 thousand people living on Earth who are so passionate about SDR that they are willing to pay, and not $ 15 for a fee on RTL, but $ 300 for a fairly advanced developer kit .  Although, if you count, 1 set for 1.415 million inhabitants is sold, so there are not too many of these people. <br><br>  But then I looked at the list of buyers, with the help of simple calculations I obtained interesting data, which I would like to present to the attention of a respected audience. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The customer list contains the name of the city and country, so we can analyze the distribution and get the following results: <br><br>  Russia: population 147 million / 1.415 = 104 expected purchases, real purchases 96, of which <br>  Moscow: population 12.3 million / 1.415 = 9 expected purchases, real purchases 34. <br><br>  We obtain the SDR-isation coefficient for Russia 96/104 = 0.9 for Moscow 3.77 centralization 4.2. <br>  Other results are calculated according to the same methodology, we will only look at the results. <br><br>  In Ukraine, everything is bad 14/29 = 0.5 s 3/2 = 1.5 c = 3, which should especially please us (personally, I am not very happy, but probably I am a bad patriot). <br><br>  Try to predict the world leader for this indicator, and then see how you guessed it ... <br><br>  Some European states: <br><br>  Russia 96/104 = 0.9 with 34/9 = 3.8 c = 4.2 <br>  Germany 216/56 = 3.85 with 18 / 2.4 = 7.5 c = 1.9 <br>  France 102/45 = 2.3 with 16/2 = 8 c = 3.5 <br>  Great Britain 213/46 = 4.6 s 23/6 = 3.8 c = 0.8 <br>  Italy 35/42 = 0.8 <br>  Poland 40/27 = 1.5 c 7 / 1.2 = 6 c = 4.0 <br>  Netherlands 74/12 = 6 <br>  Sweden 61/7 = 8.7 <br>  Switzerland 59/6 = 9.8 - here he is the leader, I am sure that you did not guess. <br><br>  Let's go a little further: <br>  Japan 53/89 = 0.6 <br>  China 101/971 = 0.1 <br><br>  (It is a little surprising that such a small number of purchases for the PRC are most likely those who are going to copy this fee and then sell it on the radio market in Shenzhen at a price 3 times less than all the other fellow citizens who are willing to wait 2 months) <br><br>  Australia 123/17 = 7.2 <br>  Canada 103/12 = 4.1 with 12/3 = 4 c = 1. <br>  New Zealand 22/3 = 7 <br><br>  But now it is time for riddles - a search for the US or the USA does not give anything that makes you think.  And here is the answer - a search for Chicago gives Chicago, IL and then everything is simple - you need to set the name of the state.  I was not interested in watching the population of individual states, so a short summary of IL = 27, TX = 89, MA = 53, WA = 67, AL = 11, etc. <br><br>  And finally, the undoubted expected leader among the states <br><br>  CA 242/27 = 8.9 is not bad, but they do not reach Sweden. <br><br>  You can make your own conclusions about the degree of involvement of the Russian population (especially with the exception of the ‚Äúcapital of our homeland of the hero-city‚Äù) in the global SDR industry, I note that the total share of 96/5300 = 1.8% correlates well with the often found estimate of our contribution of 1.5% world economy. <br><br>  That turned out to be not very funny (I don‚Äôt know how for whom, but she definitely didn‚Äôt please me) statistics.  Of course, I immediately stated that a very narrow niche is being considered and the general state of affairs in electronics may differ from that considered, but the trend can be traced. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/341856/">https://habr.com/ru/post/341856/</a></p>
