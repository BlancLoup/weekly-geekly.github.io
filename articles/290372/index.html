The first thing that occurred to us.  This is to make a video that clearly shows the principle of the application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d15/9dd/869/d159dd869bb64a798bd53b0921c5df28.jpg" height="60%" width="60%" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It was during the Startup Weekend in Chisinau.  On the first day of the event, we created the MVP and began to prepare for the presentation.  Remembering that presentation now, I understand that it was just awful, and it was only because of the video filmed ‚Äúon my knees‚Äù that we took second place. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/nT3cnAWW0GA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhisxE23vE5C6yJHSM_coPpX6XcnIA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

      After some time, they took us to Tolstoy Startup Camp.  Despite the fact that by that time we were well advanced in terms of development, the problem with communicating the value still remained.  For the first two weeks of our stay at the camp, few people managed to explain what we are doing and what is the use of it.  The endless interim presentations, at the end of which we heard the same questions like ‚Äúhow does this differ from Skype and Viber?‚Äù Did not give confidence.  Unfortunately or fortunately, the previously shot video was not suitable for demonstration in Yandex, partly because it was made for Moldovan viewers (MD abbreviation on video), partly because.  that we wanted to do something more professional this time. <br><br>  If the first video was shot for two takes on a tablet fixed in the hands of a non-drinker, then this time we decided to get down to business more seriously: we borrowed the camera, the operator and all hands-free from the team of GloberLand (Masha Terkina, Vanya Bulatov and Anton Nikeev) they tore off the green curtain from the doorway, secured the camera on two chairs and began to shoot. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/FNg-zvnJXw4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjB9bdt4Zm4F-aI8IvDWa-ehinu2Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  This time everything was filmed in several versions, with different pictures and a sequence of actions.  We decided that this option is the most successful.  But it so happened that up to this point this video was not shown to the general public, it was not even voiced.  During the final presentation, we did without it.  As a result, we received a grant from Yandex and continued to work on the product. <br><br>  The first two videos were shot in one shot, without editing, and because of this, the videos were long and boring. <br><br>  The closer we get to the date of the commercial release (of course this date was postponed several times, not without it), the more fear was that we would not be able to convey to potential users the value that our product could bring. <br><br>  I wanted to create a video that would be both understandable and viral, and selling.  But, since it‚Äôs impossible to keep up with several hares at the same time, it was decided to make two videos: one with an emphasis on virality, the other more commercial.  I think it will be easy to guess who is who: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ugs3UhNNj60%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhBuFyuCbQuRtFdP-mNSnbIMjIppg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/1-d3S1twOoU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjm25M8loHC0qnxZplLR4MWN-JAnw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  But despite this, we continued to be asked questions regarding the difference from Skype / Viber and what were the benefits of using AVO in an environment where operators provide roaming packages.  In an attempt to answer these questions once and for all, we did 2 infographics: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d42/f88/4de/d42f884de6f34f47b59be8842beff605.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/06b/def/5f3/06bdef5f38284137a62f934aeeb32d45.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Now, every time someone asked such questions, we simply showed infographics.  And everything became clear. <br><br>  After the release, we ran into another problem.  As it turned out, the registration procedure and application settings are not so simple for the average person: you need to exit the application, find some kind of contact, ‚Äúcall‚Äù to strange numbers ... Because of this, the conversion rate in the registration was extremely low: a little more than 55%.  We realized that quickly changing the logic of the application at this stage will not work, so we decided to make a series of videos in which we would show users how to use the application.  So far, in this series only 2 videos: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/vLb1JFkUh7o%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgNKGQibY40_FFdEYPU_7KW5Esytw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Z48dpcjXws%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiHoGJFAXiPhUe1QqjmWuP0blOlfA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  A week later, after we posted the first video on the channel, conversion in registration began to grow.  Now it is about 73%.  I think if our partners in SMS delivery didn‚Äôt let us down, then it could be around 80%. <br><br>  We realize that pictures and videos of all problems cannot be solved, and we continue to work on fixing the bug and improving the product.  In one of the following updates we will have a new design and additional features.  I hope we will be able to solve the problem of setting complexity, or at least make it understandable. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.avoapp.com/">www.avoapp.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290372/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290372/</a></p>
