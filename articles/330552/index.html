      So, Art.  10, which is the first to be amended as follows: "In the Russian Federation, information is disseminated freely, subject to the requirements established by the legislation of the Russian Federation."  Colleagues can blame me for the fact that 10 * 2 is indicated, but it is in the first part - the whole essence of the project is expressed, isn't it? <br><br>  Further.  "The search engine operator is <b>obliged to</b> fulfill the requirements."  Again - new commitments, sorry for the deliberate tautology.  And what is the obligation to perform? <br><br>  Here it is - the heart of the dragon: "Measures aimed at countering the use in the Russian Federation of information and telecommunications networks, information systems and programs for electronic computers to gain access to information resources, including the sites (or) pages of sites on the network" Internet ", access to which on the territory of the Russian Federation is limited in accordance with this Federal Law." <br><br>  <b>Nothing like?</b>  <b>Of course - Federal Law number 115</b> "On countering legalization ...".  Do you know how many accounts, operations and even people are blocked by this law?  And how many of them are righteous? <br><br>  And what will the RCN itself do? <br><br>  Maintain a VPN accounting system, anonymizers and their ilk.  RKN generally likes <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/330458/">lists</a> . <br>  Monitor the Internet and look for resources that will be anathematized. <br>  Search for providers through which VPN and their ilk are created (Amazon, my heartfelt greetings) <br>  Identify the owners. <br>  Block VPN, etc.  ‚ÄúEvil things‚Äù (without judgment, mind you). <br><br>  At the same time, the <a href="http://lentach.media/articles/roskomnadzor-epichno-obdelalsia-1">RKN states</a> : ‚ÄúThe system solution of the problem consists in the regulatory consolidation of the right to Roskomnadzor to determine the method of blocking by the telecom operator‚Äù, but the draft again black for whites says: ‚Äúwe are obliged <b>to</b> restrict Internet users access to information and telecommunication networks‚Äù .  How so? <br><br>  <b>And then - in general, a holiday for lawyers</b> (and fans of HYIP): assessment categories, or rather this: "or take other <b>necessary and sufficient measures</b> to stop ensuring the use in the Russian Federation."  Of course, the development of these measures, according to established tradition, will begin much later? <br><br>  Then, of course, we are talking about sanctions: sanctions are generally loved by our state, <s>but for some reason, it is not very popular among citizens.</s> <br><br>  Here are some interesting nuances: <br><br>  When the provider has taken "measures to stop ensuring the use of" malicious services ", it can notify the RKN ... then just quote:" Such notification can also be sent electronically. "  What for?  Is paper more reliable? <br><br>  Speech in the project (for now the project!) Is not only about providers, but, more importantly, about search engines.  But it can already play into the hands of DuckDuckGo or even more exotic types of these services.  In particular, search engines are obliged to: ‚Äú <b>stop,</b> on the territory of the Russian Federation, <b>issuing,</b> at the request of users of a search engine, links to information resources, including the websites (or) pages of sites on the Internet, included in the specified list.‚Äù <br><br>  Corporate VPNs are not allowed (h. 17).  Only here ... "it all goes against common sense.  The bill talks about technologies that allow you to bypass the lock.  First of all, it is VPN and anonymizers.  How will they separate a VPN, which is used for commercial purposes, from a VPN, which is used to bypass blocking?  It is impossible to determine. "  Said not by me, by the way, but by the Internet ombudsman - Dmitry Marinichev. <br><br>  The explanatory note to this ‚Äúlaw‚Äù -project deserves special attention. <br><br>  I will make intentional excerpts, the full text - see ibid. <br><br>  "Restriction of access to information resources, sites, pages of sites on the Internet, a measure that is used to prevent ... the dissemination of information." <br><br>  Further: ‚ÄúThe practice of applying the measure that has developed since 2012 has revealed the lack of effectiveness of locks‚Äù.  But what did the RKN itself say about this?  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/269994/">"The use of site blocking bypass tools is not against the law."</a> <br><br>  The most interesting thing is that the authors of the ‚Äúlaw‚Äù realize that VPN, etc.  used quite legally. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/bf9/a22/721/bf9a227215d04b07be429b83ea64b37b.png"><br><br>  One last thing: the abbreviation appears everywhere - a computer.  In this regard - my personal appeal to the citizens-regulators: replace this outdated term, since you have taken up the regulation of the Internet, and then in it - just the whole grip of projects: no preparation, no development, nothing but prohibitions, of course. <br><br>  For now.  <a href="http://eais.rkn.gov.ru/docs/Recomendation.pdf">Bow</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/330552/">https://habr.com/ru/post/330552/</a></p>
