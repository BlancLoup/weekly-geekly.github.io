      <br>
      At the time of the start of development we had: <br><ul><li>  5 licenses of Windows server 2003, </li><li>  2 MS SQL Server 2008 licenses (per processor license), </li><li>  php file storage system with C # client library, </li><li>  three JS programmers, one .NET programmer, two Objective-C programmers. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  The decisions that we made at the very start </h4><br>  Since we have several clients planned and the site will be implemented as a web application, we will strictly separate the database (model) from the views. <br><br>  We will separate the model from the presentation using the API in the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST">REST</a> format ‚Äî a platform-independent technology that is easy to implement on all clients. <br><br>  The data transfer format is JSON.  There were heated debates with the iOS team, but through brute force they were forced to work with JSON - this is more convenient for the majority. <br><br>  It was clear that working with several third-party services would introduce an element of randomness into the work of the site and iOS apps - you can never be sure that something will come back to you and, if so, when.  We also wanted to have a uniform data transfer format for all third-party services.  At that moment, the idea was born of using Node.js as a lightweight MVC controller, which will interact asynchronously with the API of third-party services, simultaneously bringing the results into the desired form. <br><br>  Thus, we have developed the concept of MVC at the level of system components.  Web and mobile applications acted as presentations.  Node.js - the controller.  .Net and third-party services - model. <br>  The only thing is that vk.com had to be tied directly to the clients since their API imposes restrictions on the number of requests from a single IP address, binds sessions to IPs and generally promotes the implementation of methods for working with the vk.com API on the client in general. <br><br>  In turn, MVC was used as an internal pattern in all client applications and in .NET.  So much for the nested doll from MVC :) <br><br>  Then it turned out that using Node.js for proxying requests to our own backend on .Net is not very convenient - the node was clearly an extra link and we saved it from this work by sending requests from clients to the .Net backend ‚Äúdirectly‚Äù through nginx. <br>  Yes, all requests through the helmet nginks.  This saves us problems with cross-domain queries, closes backend servers from direct access.  Also nginx allows in case of something unforeseen to redirect requests to another assembly / server. <br><br><h4>  What is it written on? </h4><br>  To store avatars we used a time-tested system in php, which provided storage of 120 TB of data in fidel.ru.  Place under it, of course, reduced. <br><br>  The backend is written in ASP.NET MVC 3. In working on previous projects, the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/horosho/" class="user_link">horosho</a> bundle with .NET MVC 3 showed itself from the good side - the REST API is easy and beautiful.  Entity Framework 4.2 beta is used to access the database. <br><br>  Mobile (iOS) application is written by <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/newonder/" class="user_link">newonder by</a> native means.  The application has implemented many interesting elements: a navigation menu that opens by swiping;  brushing table cells;  data model migration system.  The application is already in the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/tracks-flow/id541091119%3Fmt%3D8">AppStore</a> . <br><br>  The client part of the site is implemented by <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/vmkcom/" class="user_link">vmkcom</a> using MVC using the backbone.js + underscore.js bundle.  Routing is based on pushState and uses the history API in those browsers where it is supported, in the rest - hashtags. <br>  The good old jQuery is responsible for working with the DOM. <br>  Of the interesting features: <br><ul><li>  we use HTML5 / Flash / SilverLight player mediaelement.js, which automatically detects support for a particular codec in the browser and launches the necessary plugin for playback, </li><li>  A socket.io bundle with Node.js is used to send push notifications about new events. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Iron </h4><br>  Now the tracksflow.com service is working in the <a href="http://dtln.ru/">DataLine</a> cloud of three virtual machines: <br>  linux system with nginx + php-fpm + node.js.  Features 2 GB of memory, 32Gb hdd, 1 CPU Xeon 2.67GHz core. <br>  Windows Server 2003 IIS 6 with .NET MVC backend.  Features 2 GB of memory, 60Gb hdd, 1 CPU Xeon 2.67GHz core. <br>  Windows Server 2003 SQL Server 2008. Features 4 GB of memory, 250Gb hdd, 2 CPU core Xeon 2.67GHz. <br><br>  Total for the whole service 4 cores, 340 GB Hdd, 8 GB of memory: tracksflow.com can be safely launched on a laptop :) <br><br><h4>  Loads </h4><br>  We do not claim a high-load project.  There was a load of 50 requests per second during the publication of the blog post before last - we stood at the limit.  The narrow place was a pair of join-s, performed by the Entity Framework on the web server side.  Now we have optimized the bottlenecks, we have tested - about 500 requests per second came out. <br><br>  In the near future, several more detailed articles about different service systems are planned.  Write in the comments, what is worth telling in the first place. <br><br>  And, by the way, we are looking for <a href="http://hantim.ru/jobs/9611-js-razrabotchik">super people</a> in our excellent office on Red October. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147137/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147137/</a></p>
