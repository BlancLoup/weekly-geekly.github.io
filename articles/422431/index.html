  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Japanese fairies show the work of a master-slave trigger in a new manga for digital electronics</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Now the <a href="https://dmkpress.com/catalog/manga/978-5-97060-661-2/">Russian translation of the 2013 Japanese manga about digital circuits</a> created by Amano Hideharu and Meguro Koji is published in the publishing house DMK-Press.  Despite the frivolous form of presentation, the essence of this book is very sensible.  For example, it starts from ancient microcircuits of a small degree of integration and quickly links them to the modern Verilog hardware description language and programmable logic integrated circuits (FPGAs).  Also, the manga clearly defines why we need combinational and sequential schemes, and gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãoptimization methods. <br><br>  Manga avoids the mistakes of many of its predecessors.  One of such mistakes was made by Charles Petzold in the book ‚ÄúCode‚Äù, which introduced sequential logic not on D-flip-flops controlled by a clock edge (edge-triggered D-flip-flop), but on D-flip-flops with level operation (snaps, level-sensitive D-latch), although then switched to the correct triggers.  Probably, the error was due to the fact that Charles Petzold, who became famous as the author of GUI programming books in Microsoft Windows, was not a practicing electronics developer, and for him the latches were ‚Äúsimpler‚Äù than triggers with the front.  The problem is that the latches are poorly compatible with static analysis of delays in logical synthesis, the main technology of designing digital circuits for the past 30 years.  On-chip systems inside iPhone-type gadgets in 99% of cases, D-flip-flops are switched along the front, and latches are used only in very special cases.  Giving newbies to build schemes with snaps means to mislead them. <br><br>  In this sense, manga is better than Petzold.  This is how elegantly manga explains the work of the two-stage D-flip-flop master slave, which is controlled by the clock edge.  This is done with the help of the fairies "Hee-hee-hee" and the fairies "Ha-ha-ha":

First, in the same 1988, the technology of designing microcircuits using logic synthesis appeared, from the code in hardware description languages ‚Äã‚Äã- Verilog and VHDL. <br><br>  2. At the same time in the 1980s, programmable logic integrated circuits (FPGAs) arose ‚Äî matrices of reconfigurable logic elements, with which you can build digital circuits simply by changing the contents of the configuration memory inside the FPGA. <br><br>  3. In the 1990s, the teaching of HDL, logical synthesis and FPGA was included in the programs of all the electronics departments of Western universities, although in Russia and Ukraine, due to post-perestroika chaos, this process was slower. <br><br>  4. In the 2000s, the speed of traditional processors ceased to grow, and marketers began to predict the fragmentation of the market for embedded processors (which happened - cloud, IoT), as well as the emergence of combinations of processors and specialized computers for various tasks (which happened - first, fast mobile graphics, then specialized chips for mining cryptocurrency, computer vision and accelerators of neural networks). <br><br>  5. Now, in 2010, the FPGA board prices have dropped to the level when they became available to schoolchildren.  At the same time, the industry requires a large number of new engineers to create huge chips with neural networks.  Even if you are going to work all your life in programming, to understand new systems, you need to know how equipment works: combinational and sequential circuits, finite automata, timing, pipelining, etc.  Then you can understand whether to process data with a conventional program or a hardware block. <br><br>  <font color="blue">So microcircuits of a small degree of integration allow ‚Äútouching‚Äù hardware primitives directly.</font>  <font color="blue">And immediately after explaining about the schemes of low degree of integration, the manga introduces both the hardware description languages ‚Äã‚Äãand the FPGA:</font> <font color="blue"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/483/647/346/4836473463cb6afe4ca26477dd95f0d7.png" width="500"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cfc/95e/226/cfc95e226213fcc952bcf11a3dd06c28.png"><br><br></font>  <font color="blue">After describing the logical elements of the manga shows how to build a useful combinatorial voting scheme:</font> <font color="blue"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ae4/702/7a3/ae47027a3c1c57ccc24c009582d88733.png" width="500"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/87a/e1f/db2/87ae1fdb28b01789dffa30e45822c150.png" width="500"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/878/643/c21/878643c21fff05401be307b7efb52f0f.png" width="500"><br><br></font>  <font color="blue">Then this scheme is optimized.</font>  <font color="blue">In my opinion, manga spends too much time combinatorial optimization.</font>  <font color="blue">But it is worth remembering that the Japanese wrote the manga, and they have a principle in culture  (takum) - polishing something (for example, a sword) until it becomes perfect.</font>  <font color="blue">Therefore, in the manga there is both an optimization based on common sense, and an optimization based on Carnot diagrams.</font>  <font color="blue">Logical synthesis of hardware description languages ‚Äã‚Äãmakes such optimizations automatically:</font> <font color="blue"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/86d/68b/b60/86d68bb6091abf8a8cb0bf21e8b054f6.png" width="500"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e4f/2cb/5a3/e4f2cb5a34edc6bd285954a181d1f39f.png" width="500"><br><br></font>  <font color="blue">There is a romantic scheme in the manga, I mean the scene:</font> <font color="blue"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5f6/8f9/559/5f68f955970b8234b6783e6094ac54f5.png" width="500"><br></font> <br><br>  The majority voting scheme can be easily assembled on small-scale integrated circuits.  At the same time, it is possible to argue that it is not very interesting to observe the combinatorial AND-OR-NOT-AND-OR-NOT elements on the breadboard, since the Boolean algebra is also explained in the usual programming lesson.  It may be objected that although 7-year-old children can understand AND-OR-NOT, but when they try to understand D-triggers, some schoolchildren run across the mental barrier.  In this case, a visual demonstration becomes more valuable. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the student cannot D-triggers inside the FPGA with his hands directly.  There are tens of thousands of them in FPGA.  At Arduino, such an object does not arise at all.  And on a chip with a small degree of integration, the D-trigger can be felt like this: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tkd3PAkBpd4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <font color="blue">But how to explain the sequential schemes and D-trigger manga.</font>  <font color="blue">Note that the Japanese translator used the word ‚Äúsequential‚Äù to translate ‚Äúsequential‚Äù, although the term ‚Äúsequential‚Äù is well established in the Russian literature on digital circuitry:</font> <font color="blue"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba5/f2a/949/ba5f2a94934e24d33efc6a812e5b6975.png" width="500"><br><br></font>  <font color="blue">Here it would be possible to write more specifically that sequential schemes, as opposed to combinational, allow repeating actions and expecting events.</font>  <font color="blue">In other words, they make the computer "smart."</font>  <font color="blue">Without them, using a computer, one could only calculate the values ‚Äã‚Äãof simple arithmetic expressions:</font> <font color="blue"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9c3/d55/df6/9c3d55df6d92655ac7ebc4589d1cd3e5.png" width="500"><br><br></font>  <font color="blue">It is a pity that the manga does not tell anything about the time delays in the combination circuits and the calculation of the maximum clock frequency.</font>  <font color="blue">It could be inserted here in this place:</font> <font color="blue"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/67c/a68/f4c/67ca68f4cad0c39df72ce1b232fe3cf1.png" width="500"><br><br></font>  <font color="blue">I hope that this manga in Russia will have successors who will make some cartoon with Ivan Tsarevich and Vasilisa the Beautiful, who would introduce propagation delays and a critical path, for example, based on information from the Harris &amp; Harris textbook.</font>  <font color="blue">Here are the appropriate slides from the additional materials for the textbook:</font> <font color="blue"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d1c/858/d88/d1c858d88ba983980ab589c987660b1e.png" width="500"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2d8/b35/f07/2d8b35f079bd7298c496b5f970914f3e.png" width="500"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c24/f96/952/c24f969523371214eeb8cd622ecd9c5c.png" width="500"><br><br></font>  <font color="blue">Here, the slide in a straight form says that now for almost all elements of the state, a D-trigger is used [except for cases that beginners do not encounter at all, for example, a latch to obtain a gated clock signal without impulse interference in circuits to save energy - level-sensitive D- latch for glitch-free gated clock used in low-power designs].</font> <font color="blue"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/01e/946/e0f/01e946e0fa010f51f01b7f26f4a7ebf7.png" width="500"><br><br></font>  <font color="blue">Recall that Petzold used D-latches for his introduction, which is wrong.</font>  <font color="blue">But not only Petzold makes mistakes in this place.</font>  <font color="blue">I once made a post in LiveJournal with such a picture of the counter below from the adder and D-flip-flop, where I after that one Russian programmer from the state of Colorado argued for two days that counters are easier to build on T-flip-flops.</font>  <font color="blue">I told him that he correctly remembered T-flip-flops from his 1970s childhood, but now in the 21st century, iPhone developers are building D-flip-flop counters, because the situation of a T-flip-flop counter, in which the data signal is used as a clock signal , badly fits with the analysis of timing in chips of billions of transistors (if you disagree with me, please split my opinion with links to the ASIC libraries from TSMC, Synopsys Design Compiler, etc.):</font> <font color="blue"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6f2/70b/d02/6f270bd027a707abd336c170d85da49a.gif"><br><br></font>  <font color="blue">Now here is a series of pictures familiar to us about the work of the two-step (master-slave) D-trigger with fairies:</font> <font color="blue"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb7/510/bb6/cb7510bb6a4a9c6d1577bdaa5c73709d.png" width="500"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/675/298/ba6/675298ba6ec5abd20565474e48f32355.png" width="500"><br><br></font>  <font color="blue">With an easy-to-understand timing diagram, the data is recorded only at the time of the positive edge of the D flip-flop, the rest of the time they are ignored:</font> <font color="blue"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c4f/e51/1a7/c4fe511a7c39780eade6d678ec8cd58e.png" width="500"><br><br></font>  <font color="blue">Now the manga turns to the example of using the D-trigger to build the simplest finite state machine - a device for throwing an electronic bone.</font>  <font color="blue">To be honest, I‚Äôm not really excited about this part of the book.</font>  <font color="blue">Let's say this, a degenerate finite automaton, in which states go in a circle, stopped by one bit - the stop button.</font>  <font color="blue">If there were several automata in the sample book, everything would be OK, but putting it as the only example is wrong.</font>  <font color="blue">It does not show the entire class of problems that can be solved with the help of finite automata.</font>  <font color="blue">Below I will show how I would add it.</font> <font color="blue"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a77/18c/53d/a7718c53d17d661f0a1b9e06cedd0f15.png" width="500"><br><br></font>  <font color="blue">State diagram 0-1-2-3-4-5:</font> <font color="blue"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/45e/d14/cdb/45ed14cdb1b0237b160ebee59625b290.png"><br><br></font>  <font color="blue">Binary states that are written in three D-flip-flops:</font> <font color="blue"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/34c/aee/833/34caee833f8762e5478b5b7b211bc05b.png"><br><br></font>  <font color="blue">Combinatorial scheme that gets a new state from the old:</font> <font color="blue"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f7d/7dd/f79/f7d7ddf79e2c6214b6736b608a20f4e2.png" width="500"><br><br></font>  <font color="blue">Finally, the manga shows how to design the same scheme not by drawing with the mouse on the screen, but by using the synthesis from the hardware description language Verilog.</font>  <font color="blue">Although this code looks similar to a code of a programming language like Pascal or Java, but this code has a completely different nature.</font>  <font color="blue">The purpose of the code on the chain is to turn into a circuit with wires and transistors.</font>  <font color="blue">And the code in a programming language is compiled into a chain of instructions, zeros and ones that are stored in memory [it is clear that both Verilog and Java can be interpreted + the code on Verilog can turn into zeros and units for the configuration of the FPGA + Java can be interpreted as Verilog and also become a scheme, but these are details that do not contribute to the initial understanding]:</font> <font color="blue"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f74/751/04c/f7475104c0c36e123a4e3f4a1ca70275.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ec7/282/6d5/ec72826d5e6105d6b2f6fdcf8a9ed7aa.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b49/527/f30/b49527f301e06f539bbecb69c8552e3f.png"><br><br></font>  <font color="blue">Now I kind of added an example about the finite automaton I.</font>  <font color="blue">I would make a more interactive example of a finite state machine, for example using the analogy with the so-called ‚ÄúChinese Room‚Äù.</font>  <font color="blue">Here is my description of the Chinese room, removed by the editor from my ten-year-old article in The New Times magazine (this magazine is not only about politics, it also has popular technology):</font> <font color="blue"><br></font> <blockquote>  In 1980, one of the critics of artificial intelligence, John Searle (John Searle) put forward an elegant argument, called the "Chinese room".  Suppose that in the future there is a version of the program "Eliza", speaking Chinese so well that the Chinese could not distinguish a computer from a person.  Now suppose that someone would rewrite this program into a thick book with mechanical instructions for a person - if you see hieroglyph A and saw hieroglyph B before, then pull out h character C from the box. Now we will put a certain person who does not know Chinese in a closed room with This book and will push him under the door signs with hieroglyphs containing questions in Chinese.  Following the mechanical instructions from the book, the person will find in the box and push back the other signs with hieroglyphs.  From the point of view of an external observer, the room will ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù and ‚Äúspeak‚Äù in Chinese.  But who is the carrier of this mind?  After all, the performer does not understand Chinese? <br><br>  John McCarthy and other veterans of artificial intelligence immediately declared that the mind and even the consciousness would manifest itself in a ‚Äúvirtual personality‚Äù or in a ‚Äúprocess‚Äù carried out in this room.  One of the elegant arguments against John Searle was put forward by the philosophers Paul and Patricia Churchland.  As we know from physics, Chirchlendy argued, light is an electromagnetic wave.  Suppose that a skeptic begins to move the magnet with his hand, does not see the light, and begins to assert that light is impossible.  In fact, in order to receive the light, it is necessary to wave the magnet at a speed of 450 billion strokes per second.  So the rational consciousness, asserted Cherchlendy, will arise in the "Chinese room" if the performer is sufficiently agile. <br><br>  Interestingly, Ukrainian science fiction writer Anatoly Dneprov described an analogue of the ‚ÄúChinese Room‚Äù back in the 1950s in the story ‚ÄúThe Game‚Äù. <br></blockquote>  So here.  For my own lectures and materials, I came up with an example in which the finite state machine (FSM) in response to a sequence of any number of hieroglyphs "bear" and "tree", with the final hieroglyph "science" - gives a sequence of hieroglyphs "Siberia".  This is the simplest "Chinese room": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/43b/03d/68f/43b03d68ff309f28f83365a237e8a0c1.png" width="500"><br><br>  Here is its state diagram: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3d3/701/494/3d370149474b462278f8f15b8498f33a.png" width="500"><br><br>  From this diagram, it is possible to construct a circuit and implement it on the FPGA board. <br><br>  The other day, I used excerpts from this manga by Amano Hideharu and Meguro Koji, when I lectured on Skype from California to 150 students from Kazan Innopolis.  Students begin to study computer architecture, and they need to break through the barrier of initial misunderstanding of digital logic.  For this, the manga is very good, especially if used in combination with textbooks such as Harris &amp; Harris ‚ÄúDigital Circuit Design and Computer Architecture‚Äù. <br><br>  Here is a video from this lecture: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UqJWZ7oN0sc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Slides for this and the next lecture can be downloaded here: <br><br>  <a href="http://bit.ly/2018-01-25-verilog-1-innopolis-yuri-panchul">http://bit.ly/2018-01-25-verilog-1-innopolis-yuri-panchul</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://bit.ly/2018-02-01-verilog-2-innopolis-yuri-panchul">http://bit.ly/2018-02-01-verilog-2-innopolis-yuri-panchul</a> <br><br>  Now, many readers of posts about FPGAs often have a question: ‚ÄúWhy is it necessary, because there are more works on Java?‚Äù <br><br>  You can answer this: according to the glassdoor site in San Jose, California, digital designers are more expensive than Java developers: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5fc/611/2f0/5fc6112f0b409e0642ea4d11c7d0fbbe.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8bf/ee1/0eb/8bfee10ebf1081fc0346285b75ef76d3.png"><br><br>  And if the reader says ‚ÄúWhat do I mean to San Jose?  I‚Äôm in Russia and I‚Äôm not threatened to go to San Jose ‚Äù, then you can bring a fresh example that the newlyweds from St. Petersburg took first place in the Intel InnovateFPGA competition in Europe, after which they took second place in the world finals in San Jose.  Here they are sitting in Intel's office in San Jose a few days ago.  For having made a project on FPGA.  Maybe for the project on Java Intel brought someone to San Jose with the award, but I personally do not know such examples. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/479/056/435/479056435f5a618aa3298b60af13a542.jpg"><br><br>  Vladislav Sharshin, Andrey Papushin, Yelena Kirichenko - <a href="http://www.innovatefpga.com/cgi-bin/innovate/teams.pl%3FId%3DEM076">www.innovatefpga.com/cgi-bin/innovate/teams.pl?Id=EM076</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a44/136/35e/a4413635eb359ee6375dccd425eeca86.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/547/80b/979/54780b979dafd7508595822a45786b82.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422431/">https://habr.com/ru/post/422431/</a></p>
