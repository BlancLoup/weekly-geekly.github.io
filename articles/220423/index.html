  <section class="page js-page"><h1>And how are you intellectuals?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/64a/e65/0d2/64ae650d2bedd7963ad1ed8822c453bc.jpg">  Peace, labor, May, to you, habrazhiteli.  May Day, as you know, Labor Day.  Therefore, today we will talk about work, that is, about work.  Of course, about working at Intel. <br>  Intel employees are unique people, and this is the truth!  I have not yet seen a single person who, when leaving a company for various life reasons and circumstances, did not emphasize in his farewell letter, thanks to all my colleagues and the company for giving it to him.  The company really has its own internal culture - a kind of INTEL-ligence.  Many different factors contribute to this.  The atmosphere in which employees work is very special.  For those who have never come across large foreign companies, everything seems unusual.  But even in comparison with other IT giants, there is something of their own here that you will not find anywhere else.  And this is great! <br>  Perhaps some things seem quite unusual, to say the least, but more fun with them.  We have compiled the TOP-10 of the most interesting, in my opinion, facts from the life of Intel employees.  I propose to get acquainted with them and assess the level of their own INTEL ligence, passing a small test at the end of the post.  I‚Äôll say right away that there is a <b>prize</b> for the winner <b>- a Dell Venue 8 tablet</b> with x86 CPU. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The items below are not rated, but in a completely random order. <br><br>  1. Training.  Learning is, as you know, light, and various training courses are constantly held for Intel employees.  This is an everyday thing habitual for us.  Attendance is optional, but there are also very mandatory, annual and quarterly trainings, such as countering bribery and corruption.  In addition, various "military exercises" are being held.  For example, an impressive box is left in the hallway, and the inspectors are waiting for the staff to respond.  In most companies, by the way, they would simply not have paid attention to this - it lies, which means that someone needs it. <br><br>  2. Well, since I started talking about the trainings, I singled out the training on Intel architecture.  As you understand, since the company is the world's largest manufacturer of processors, who else but its employees know about it in detail.  The training is mandatory for all employees and is held every two years in an online form, with testing organized at the end of the course.  It is interesting to observe how employees with a delay of only a few seconds (and the test time is limited) mark in the form the code names of the processors corresponding to the technological process, say, 22 nm.  It seems that if you wake them in the middle of the night, and ask: "22 nanometer process technology, quickly, speak!", In response you will instantly hear "Ivy Bridge, Haswell ... tick-tock taxis!".  That's how we live.

      3. Book everything and everyone!  Wherever you go, this place can and should be booked through an online resource.  Recreation room - forward, but only zabukat first.  Want to play football on the sports field - please, but do not get the keys if you have not taken care of in advance.  And over time, it is not at all annoying and it seems natural.  So I don‚Äôt want to go to the toilet because I didn‚Äôt book in advance.  Just kidding, toilets this rule does not apply.  Perhaps only on them. <br><br>  4. Since we remembered the toilet.  In the building, as in many other modern offices, there is a pass system based on badges and various access rights to this or that room.  So, in Intel, they are needed always and everywhere!  And then the toilet?  No, for him, thank God, he is not needed.  Apparently for now, but in the shower - yes.  It happened, by the way, because the cold water is heated by the heat generated from the data center.  Accordingly, the shower room is very close, in the restricted area.  Therefore, if you want to wash, so take care of this and request access to the shower from your manager.  Apparently, for this reason, you can go into the elevator, feel the whole bouquet of the wonderful smell of work. <br><br>  5. A little about sports.  The office has a sufficient number of young and active people seeking a healthy lifestyle.  The management encourages this and, moreover, forms some teams of engineers on an ‚ÄúOlympic‚Äù basis.  I will explain.  There is a development team in which the base is tennis players.  Therefore, candidates, if any, are sought with the appropriate rank in tennis.  This, other things being equal, will not be weak plus in your resume.  Thus, in the company there are both football players, and volleyball players, and other kinds of sports are not deprived.  As a result, in various sports tournaments, the Intel team regularly occupies the top lines, which contributes to image enhancement.  And I am ready to agree with that - it's nice to know that the company is strong in everything! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/231/416/68c/23141668cd7e9fb64150fb85398d95ca.gif"><br><br>  6. Security.  This moment is given great attention, and this, of course, is absolutely correct.  Trainings, access system, and much more are aimed at providing it.  In particular, regular checks of workplaces by security officers.  Here you have departed from a workplace for a minute, and have put the laptop in a box.  Come - and he's already there.  The guard doesn‚Äôt sleep and removes it, even from the box, if it was not locked.  I'm not talking about just leaving it on the table.  So "nikht klak-klats".  There is a hunt for non-locked cars.  Moreover, masking in the form of turning off the monitor does not help.  Protection includes it and makes sure that everything is securely password protected. <br><br>  7. The security issue includes a lot of things, including the parking area.  It has a speed limit of 10 km / h, and security officers literally ‚Äúlie in wait‚Äù, as valiant traffic police officers.  Exceeded - get a penalty of deprivation of the right of parking for a week, again - for a year.  Of course, they do not deprive them right away; you can appeal - well, just like in any democratic country.  In any case, the rule is the rule and you need to be careful!  It‚Äôs impossible to come to an agreement on the spot - real police are working here rather than militiamen. <br><br>  8. Meetings.  In any other domestic company they are called meetings.  Rallies are appointed for any reason and quite become the norm for every employee of Intel.  In conjunction with booking give the strongest effect.  All life comes down to a constant booking rallies.  Even for sports, a rally is being created so that everyone can see that you are busy at this time, and you will not be able to attend another rally, so do not book a rally over the rally. <br><br>  9. Civil liability.  He called it this way, although in Russia there are other terms that we will not give here.  If you see any injustice, you can always complain both to your boss and to a special committee.  A kind of Ministry of Interior, in a good sense of the word.  See that they hurt your colleague - write a letter, and sanctions will follow.  But it is, nevertheless, a very big rarity.  This civil liability operates more often in the other direction - the direction of encouragement.  Employees of the company do not like to stand aside if they see that the merits of their fellow workers go unnoticed.  And they ‚Äúinform‚Äù about his outstanding results, on the basis of which he is encouraged by various awards - awards. <br><br>  10. One of them is the opportunity to score a rally with ... a massage therapist.  After receiving a special stimulating award (Relaxation Award), the distinguished "hard worker" will have the opportunity to book a massage room.  In the office for a long time there is a massage room, but for denyuzhku.  Imagine how nice it is to come in the middle of the working day to the rally and give your back an hour of wonderful rest.  And all this for your beautifully done work.  By the way, it is worth noting that there is a massage chair, but it doesn‚Äôt compare with a real professional! <br><br>  Actually, these are the realities that Intel employees of one of the Russian offices face every day.  Well, if you read up to this point, understand that my post was a little late with the date of publication.  It was planned for April 1, and today - May Day.  By the way, punctuality is another quality of INTEL ligation.  So, of course, somewhere I exaggerated, something from the story is not true, but something even is. <br><br>  As stated at the beginning of the post, I suggest you take the test.  Write in the comments what is described as true in your understanding, and what is not.  It will be convenient if the answer is in the format of ‚Äúitem - true / partially true / false‚Äù, for example, ‚Äú1 - true, 2 - partially true‚Äù and so on.  Free answers with your comments are also possible - even more interesting. <br><br>  The most INT ligent of readers, who will be the closest to the truth (and is not an employee of Intel or its closest relative who are not allowed to participate), will receive a valuable prize - a tablet based on the Intel Atom CPU running Android - Dell Venue 8. <br><br>  <b>UPD.</b>  <b>The contest is over, thank you very much for your participation!</b>  <b>Almost all commentators in most of the answers (&gt; 50%) were right.</b>  <b>However, no one showed a 100% result.</b>  <b>But it turned out to be the closest to the truth and at the same time argued his answers to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/boristm/" class="user_link">boristm</a> , which is declared the winner.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>The correct answers to the questions of the contest are sent to a personal mail to all who took part in it.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/220423/">https://habr.com/ru/post/220423/</a></p>
