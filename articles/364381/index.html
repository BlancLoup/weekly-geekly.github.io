  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Personal Effectiveness System ‚ÄúAn Important Event of the Day‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Greetings to the community.  I would like to talk about the system of personal effectiveness "important event of the day." <br>  I learned about this system at one of the business trainings.  I don‚Äôt know the original technique (I couldn‚Äôt find it), so I‚Äôm describing it as I heard it and use it myself. <br><br>  Immediately go to the point. <br><br><h2>  Description </h2><br>  Every day you need to record the most important event that happened to you during the day.  An event can be from any sphere of life.  For example: tidied up the room, closed project X, sex, watched a movie, etc. 
      <br>

      Further, when the week comes to an end, it is necessary to choose the ‚Äúmost important event of the week‚Äù from the days that were during the week.  It is better not to generalize the week, namely, to choose from the days already recorded. <br><br>  For the month you need to choose the best of weeks.  And so on for the quarter and year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/94d/20f/31a/94d20f31a74847ac95a01862b1a7b414.png"><br><br>  The first time was not just to use the technique: I forgot to fix the data, I had to remember the events as much as the whole week.  But over time, the habit has reached automatism and it has become much easier. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  What for? </h2><br><h3>  Productivity analysis </h3><br>  One of the weeks was pretty routine at work.  Over the weekend, he dealt with various domestic problems.  This week the most "important" event was my "trip to the market."  I was upset when I discovered this.  Couldn't I have done something really important in a week?  It happened that in a month nothing particularly important happened.  Awareness of this fact motivates very well. <br><br><h3>  Analysis of the importance of events </h3><br>  Sometimes we do not notice what is really important in our life and what is not.  One of the good exercises is the choice of an important event.  I will give an example that impressed me the most. <br><br>  In early 2013, I planned a trip to another city for a developer conference.  I was already confident in advance that this event would be the most important for the week, month, possibly for the quarter.  But literally 1 day before the trip, I made the decision to leave postgraduate school, I will not delve into the reasons for such a decision, but for me it turned out to be quite bold, not typical of me.  And the very fact of making such a decision turned out to be more important than the whole trip. <br><br><h3>  Picture of the past </h3><br>  "Let go of your past," "you need to live in the present."  Periodically, I thought, is it worth using this technique?  After all, this is really "digging in the past." <br><br>  But as it turned out, it is interesting and pleasant to look at their events.  When 2013 came to an end, I saw what I was doing the whole year.  I already forgot many events and I was pleased to remember them.  Thus, I began to treat this technique as a special form of photography, to which it is sometimes pleasant to return, see and recall. <br><br><h2>  Instruments </h2><br>  I do not like paper, so the information was immediately recorded on an electronic device. <br>  The first year I used Evernote.  In general, it was convenient.  Large, many times nested list.  But when the year came to an end, it was necessary to constantly scroll the note down to complete the information, which was often annoying.  Of course, it was possible to keep the list in reverse order (to add an event to the beginning), but I thought about it too late, and I‚Äôm not sure that it would be more convenient to keep the nested list. <br><br>  The following year I used the mind map app.  It is a year in the center, quarters from it, months from them, etc.  This option was already much more beautiful than the previous one and somewhat more convenient.  In addition to the above described technique, I began to add colors to events (red is negligible, yellow is so-so ..., light green is excellent, dark green is VERY cool).  Thus, the map began to look even more pleasant. <br><br>  In both cases, the technique included a rather large amount of routine.  It was necessary to constantly record the dates, follow the beginning / end of the new period.  Therefore, I decided to make a small plugin for my <a href="http://slash-system.com/">mind map application</a> , which would automatically track for me the ‚Äúintegrity of input‚Äù, and I would only have to enter events and choose the best.  The plugin is still under development.  There is a small <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Djn0SJSTnUtk">demo</a> . <br><br>  Do you use a similar technique?  Share experiences in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364381/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364381/</a></p>
