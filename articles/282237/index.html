Documentation involves the collection of data, the archiving of events in text, iconographic, electronic or other forms of recording and presenting information.  However, documentation is only a compilation of information, giving only unstructured ideas about the figurative content of the play.  By putting this puzzle together, we, as it were, turn back time and reconstruct the theatrical event, which allows us to preserve it for the memory of future researchers. <br><br>  The reconstruction of the theatrical event has as its main task the preservation of theatrical heritage, therefore the historical performance was the subject of the project.  In the XIX century.  fixing options were limited.  There was no video, the photo fixing process was very different from the modern principle of the second click.  Thanks to the development of modern technologies, it became possible to recreate the appearance of a theatrical event by transferring the material information media to digital format, and then synthesizing them.  The main task that was set during the implementation of this project was to find the optimal way to organize existing sources for visualizing the action of the performance in its continuity using information and communication technologies (ICT). <br><br>  Information and communication technologies are used at various stages of the life cycle of theatrical production in solving the following tasks: <br>  1. creative: <br>  - product previsualization (creative, technical, image); <br><br>  2. production: <br>  - preparation, demonstration, management, local and network distribution of the product; <br>  - Documentation of theater and film sets; <br>  - documenting and archiving the product; <br><br>  3. educational (rehearsal and educational process): <br>  - simulator directors and artists; <br>  - historical scientific and educational reconstruction; <br>  - serious games; <br>  - holding online festivals, master classes, conferences, seminars; <br><br>  4. marketing: <br>  - integration into the site (portal) of a creative organization; <br>  - electronic, printed and souvenir products. <br><br>  During the work on this project the following tasks were solved: <br>  1. 3D reconstruction of an authentic three-dimensional model of the scene of the Alexandrinsky Theater, taking into account the peculiarities of historical reconstruction (during the nineteenth century); <br>  2. Virtual reconstruction of theatrical production, the first act of the production of ‚ÄúThe Seagull‚Äù on the stage of the Alexandrinsky Theater (October 17, 1896). <br><br>  <b>3D model of the main stage of the Alexandrinsky Theater</b> <br><br>  ITMO University and the Laboratory of Computer Graphics and Virtual Reality (St. Petersburg State University of Aerospace Instrumentation), together with the Alexandrinsky Theater and the Russian State Institute of Stage Arts created the reconstruction of the main stage of the Alexandrinsky Theater. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2df/4cf/d68/2df4cfd68e2e46e7b375bd9543e29076.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  To create an authentic virtual reconstruction, both rough sketches of the stage and the auditorium as well as technical documentation of the stage equipment at different periods of time, including the reconstruction of the theater in 2006, were used. <br><br>  During the work on the reconstruction of the detailed authentic model of the Alexandrinsky Theater, various methods and approaches used in the process of three-dimensional modeling were used.  For example, numerous and very detailed elements of the side boxes were created in a combined way: partly using three-dimensional modeling, partly using a set of textures and technologies Normal bump and Displacement.  Fabric curtains on the beds were created in a program that allows you to simulate the behavior of fabrics with high accuracy in accordance with physical laws and collisions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a7e/0c5/5b2/a7e0c55b2ab74fbab0df31207562679d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Virtual reconstruction of the theatrical production ‚ÄúThe Seagull‚Äù (Act I, October 17, 1896)</b> <br><br>  The staging of the legendary play by A.P. Chekhov ‚ÄúThe Seagull‚Äù on the stage of the imperial Alexandrinsky Theater on October 17, 1896, became a milestone indicating the change of theatrical systems.  It is from this milestone that the theater of the twentieth century, with its search for new theatrical forms, the new theatrical language, is counting. <br><br>  The process of virtual reconstruction of the first picture of the play ‚ÄúThe Seagull‚Äù on the stage of the Alexandrinsky Theater was achieved through the implementation of the following components: <br><br>  2.1 Creating an authentic 3D model of the scene of the Alexandrinsky Theater, based on the principles of historical reconstruction (recreating the historical appearance of the scene of the 19th century); <br>  2.2 Creating the necessary 3D elements of the scene (curtain, accessories, props and accessories) and adding these objects to the set design; <br>  2.3.  Design of static models of actors in stage costumes, involved in the first act of the production of "The Seagull" (in watercolor technique), which were used to search for a suitable artistic technique to achieve the set;  This approach provided the required degree of authenticity and accurate visual presentation of stage design. <br>  2.4.  Design of a dynamic scenery system and lighting system during the first act of staging. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b6/6dc/089/7b66dc08993f47fc9fb69dd28ad2cd81.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The specificity of the project was that to date there have not been preserved photos of the decoration design of the play.  There are only sketches and descriptions.  On the basis of these data, as well as the understanding that during this period the scenery was made on the principle of sets consisting of universal modules, a picture was drawn up of what constituted the stage decoration of the performance. <br>  For the multimedia historical reconstruction of the play ‚ÄúThe Seagull‚Äù, a number of three-dimensional models were created, including the very interior of the Alexandrinsky Theater, stage decorations, furniture and interior design. <br><br>  Work was carried out on the detailed texturing of the scenery, which was drawn by the artist on the basis of the preserved photographs of the period of the historical reconstruction of this performance. <br><br>  Since the hanging decorations, in reality, were depicted on gauze and had almost no thickness, it was decided to use the usual plane with a superimposed texture and a mask of transparency.  A total of twenty-three elements of hanging decorations were created.  In addition to hanging decorations, a number of three-dimensional models of furniture (table, chairs and a bench, etc.) and decoration elements (a gazebo platform, a ramp for red lanterns, etc.) were created to fill the scene. <br><br>  The figures of the actors, recreated in the technique of watercolor, were also depicted by the artist and placed in a three-dimensional scene using the same technology as the hanging scenery.  This is a fundamental decision, which was made in order to avoid object congestion, as well as for a more schematic and visually understandable location of the actors on the stage.  In total, sixty-five actors were placed (for each actor several provisions were created) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7d3/c45/83f/7d3c4583fff84fa78fb727acf97b5027.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Based on the archival documentation, under the guidance of professionals in theatrical activities, the stage lighting of the play (lighting pictures) was recreated in the reconstruction in accordance with the technical features of the time.  Were also modeled - the change of lighting in the process of the performance and special effects. <br>  During the work on the reconstruction of the first picture of the play ‚ÄúThe Seagull‚Äù it was necessary to demonstrate the position and movement of the actors in the reconstructed scenery of this historical performance.  It was decided to present the staging of the performance - as a sequence of consecutive images that demonstrate the location of the actors on the stage, as well as to visualize the dialogues pronounced by the actors. <br>  Example of stage setting: <br>  Medvedko and Masha stand near the table on the left side of the stage (closer to the center). <br>  Medvedko.  Why do you always go in black? <br>  Masha.  This is the mourning of my life.  I am not happy. <br>  In total, about seventy-three mise en scenes were created for the 1st picture of the play ‚ÄúThe Seagull‚Äù. <br><br>  In addition, a prototype of a multimedia library related to project documentation - <a href="http://seagull.ifmo.ru/">seagull.ifmo.ru was developed</a> , which gives any Internet user the opportunity to get acquainted with the results of research work and their practical application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bcd/4ec/205/bcd4ec2054dd476ca751ef70f356c6a8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br>  The multimedia reconstruction of a theatrical event is an attempt to recreate a unique image of a historical performance based on the surviving materials, by synthesizing the available information into a visual form. <br>  During the work on this project, the following principles of multimedia reconstruction of the theatrical event were identified and used: <br><br>  1. Modeling the stage area and the auditorium. <br>  2. Modeling stage design. <br>  3. Modeling stage characters. <br>  4. Modeling the staging of the performance. <br>  5. Modeling stage lighting. <br>  6. Modeling sound score. <br><br>  Authors: Nikolay Borisov, Alexander Nikitin, Alexander Chepurov, Artem Smolin, Vasily Trushin </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/282237/">https://habr.com/ru/post/282237/</a></p>
