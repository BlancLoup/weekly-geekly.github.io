  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About compassion for the pain of others</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today is the time to talk with you about such unique properties of a person as empathy, how to feel the pain of others and the ability to carry it through yourself.  Today, this particular feature of a person is everywhere superseded by cynicism and snobbery, complacency and callousness, and I see this as the main reason for the poor quality of information products created on the Russian market. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>Khanin looked up.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúYou've learned a lot from words, praise,‚Äù he said.</i>  <i>- But how do you not understand that such things are not offered?</i>  <i>After all, they poured all the blood of their hearts into this Tampaco.</i>  <i>This is for them as ... In short, people have a full identification with their product, and you say such things to them.</i>  <i>It's like a mother to say: your son is, of course, a freak, but we will let him face a little paint and it will be fine.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- But indeed the name is terrible.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- What do you want - that they were happy or you?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>IN.</i>  <i>Pelevin Generation P</i> </blockquote><br>  Why, when designing modern websites, is the ability to feel the reality of someone else's pain is a much more important skill than the ability to lay layers or move gray squares across the screen?  This is partly due to the national mentality, namely, with our centuries-old pride that all processes in our ordinary reality occur only "regardless of ...", "in the fight against ..." and "overcoming ..." everything else.

Arguments?  Here you are - the most ordinary planning vacation or apartment renovation is a light positive entertainment only for the meager layer of wealthy people who are many abroad and in Moscow-City, and very few in Russia.  For the average Russian, buying a tour to Turkey and wallpaper in the living room for the agonies of choice, for the abundance of scandals, for changing the initial decision and for finding discounts - more likely resembles the difficult and painful process of choosing the ‚Äúsmallest evil‚Äù possible. <br><br>  <b>How to use the feeling of someone else's pain in practice?</b> <br><br>  Creating a new web service is not at all worth thinking that a person is willing to joyfully accept the very first sentence he sees, which the search system will give him.  Nothing of the kind, an ordinary person is not locked up at all in an Internet prison, but has a huge amount of diverse sources of information, and therefore the key mistake of an inexperienced website designer is the idea that people who are looking for the first available fencing service come to the fence construction site he creates.  Not at all, here is a real case for you, recorded from the words of a real and living person, which contains a huge amount of internal pain and conflicts that exist in his life, regardless of the use of parallax on your website: <br><br>  <i>A) There is an acquaintance of Lech, who works in some kind of sharaga, where houses, bathhouses are built, and, well, fences are put together.</i>  <i>I would have called him, but, having known Lech for a long time, I understand what quality these fences would be if everything is the same as him.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>B) So, Petr Petrovich advises me to another company.</i>  <i>Well, yes, I know him - he always climbs with his advice, shows that he knows everything and constantly tries to teach everyone life.</i>  <i>To order now through the firm he has advised is to make this eccentric forever understand that his advice will be constantly needed, valuable and important in the future, so then he will not be dismissed from his chair at all.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>C) Another friend of his wife offers a firm, there they have such a ‚Äúcute sitop, all this vanilla and designer‚Äù.</i>  <i>Well, women, what to take from them, what all these glamorous designers, who bought themselves gay phones, can do (the author of the article is not homophobic, but you need to understand the system of values ‚Äã‚Äãof the audience), understand as a professional sheet, in welding the gate and so on?</i>  <i>Surely, behind this beautiful picture they just sit next to ‚Äúeffective managers‚Äù who vacuum all orders from Ineta, make a wrap of 200% and then throw off ready-made orders to the left brigade, which they found through the local newspaper.</i>  <i>Conclusion - do not even call.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>And what is the result?</i>  <i>Here there are a lot of options, but there is nothing to choose from: either hack work, now nyashnost, then template non-living phrases that competitors have accumulated from each other.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Yeah.</i>  <i>Here's a great site - no woman's honey, just a simple black table on a white background with a list of options and prices.</i>  <i>It is good that there is no rubbish like ‚ÄúOur Advantages‚Äù or there are forged reviews, but there is a photo where you can see the quality of the welding of the gate, and then the process of concreting the pillars is shown in the video (taken on the phone).</i>  <i>And at the bottom of the brigade's phone - great, but what else does a normal peasant need to call and decide everything on time?</i> <br><br>  Women have their own particular pain (I use this term because the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù is a broken nail), which the use of a smoothie does not help to comprehend.  Of course, let's take another real case and show how an understanding of women's pain could help us all start to make quality kindergarten sites.  Again, the top of the ‚Äúprofessional profanation‚Äù will think that when looking for a children's website through a search engine, a woman has never seen herself before, has not visited herself, and knows nothing about gardens at all, and that any picture with a smiling child (piglet) can instantly make it melt her maternal heart.  To consider strangers so primitive is snobbery, already growing into some kind of racism.  I quote: <br><br>  <i>1) So, here's a site with standard "welcomes you ...".</i>  <i>I don‚Äôt need to greet me, you write an exemplary menu of dishes, it‚Äôs important for me to know how, besides the sausages with pasta, my child with a problem stomach will eat.</i>  <i>By now by</i> <i><br></i>  <i>2) So, and also remember about the regular ARI.</i>  <i>Does the following site mention the availability of a bedroom airing schedule, as well as standards for temperature and humidity in the room?</i>  <i>Not.</i>  <i>Do people know about the standards of stay in the air for each age group?</i>  <i>It seems not, but people can draw giraffe beautifully.</i>  <i>Well, well done, what, let the giraffes call them ...</i> <i><br></i>  <i>3) Another site where in the photo some sort of unintelligible aunts stand among a bevy of kids.</i>  <i>What are these aunts, what kind of education, diplomas, certificates do they have, is it possible to see their profiles in social networks?</i>  <i>Well, of course, libertarian values ‚Äã‚Äãhave been adopted in my family, and how can I protect my child from rabid slogans that he will have to listen to for 8 hours a day?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>4) Here is another kindergarten, about which friends have long complained that there are monthly fees for curtains.</i>  <i>Look at the photos and see the cheapest curtains on the windows.</i>  <i>Conclusion - another gathering of thieves and scammers under the guise of a children's institution.</i>  <i>Give such a child?</i>  <i>Never.</i> <br><br>  Did your keywords work here, gentlemen promoters?  Did the logo with glasses and mustaches shoot, gentlemen, illustrators?  Until you miss all the maternal pain through your own heart - and never shoot.  Solve the real troubles of people who can not be understood by simply viewing the most popular queries on WordStat or studying the latest fashion on animation in Dribble.  How sad it was to admit it, but the changeable fashion for graphic techniques doesn‚Äôt affect the healing of the user's inner pain, which appeared to him long before he started visiting sites and turning on the PC at all. <br><br>  The entire customer journey map, designed by you, in which the user starts using a PC or mobile gadget to solve his problem earlier than 5-6 steps, has nothing to do with reality and is not able to understand and feel other people's pain, because they give it with formalism and heartlessness in the example below: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/e51/8cd/650/e518cd650235a3e6ca409e591ed751a2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, this is why, in the first few months from the moment of their appearance, services that promise a manager's call back within 30 seconds or less have fired so soon.  These modal windows responded to the real alien pain of an ordinary ordinary person: ‚ÄúWell, I will leave them my phone now, so what?  And when they call, who will call, will the office call 2 years ago and did they forget to delete the site? ‚ÄùFor many people, the guarantee of receiving feedback from a certain set of pages and pictures, in the first six months after the appearance, was akin to discovering America, less. <br><br>  So, the problem of empathy, having an open, vulnerable heart for an interface designer is important, of course, not only when choosing a brigade or kindergarten.  Thus, a person who has spent his whole life on a stable salary will never understand the full force of the inner pain of an ordinary businessman, every second holding in his head the simple idea that his every decision, any unjustified waste, can deal a fatal blow to his whole life and welfare his family.  The designer on a stable income - consistently will not hear the entire depth of others and problems alien to him personally. <br><br>  <b>Travel Russia</b> <br><br>  Or another funny example - the boom of development in Russia of domestic tourism.  This is when a person who flew in yesterday from Frankfurt via Los Angeles, suddenly found out that somewhere in Russia there is a kind of cool place called Arkaim and that tourists can also be carried there.  The collection of money from investors already begins, and the order of a unique design and beautiful presentations - after all, from the Moscow office this idea looks super-promising.  This is an excellent illustrative example of complete isolation from reality, when pictures of hotels for foreign tourists, social profiles of all friends and acquaintances, slaughtered selfies from Arkaima are already drawn in the heads of snobs of this kind who do not feel real human pain ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/882/f90/3e7/882f903e788e33dbcf3eb39205abc17b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In fact, my friends, Arkaim is not at all Nice, but the journey time from the nearest airport or from the railway junction to the tourist center - about 6 hours by car, and in one direction.  Imagine a foreigner with a family who wants to ride on a UAZ through the mud for the very 6 hours to inspect such a field in the wilderness, where there is no 4G for the active use of the instagram? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/492/fff/a55/492fffa5524114c587499d6735f5889a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  From the same opera and funny in their naivete ideas to carry tourists into the first hall, in which the famous boxing world champion Konstantin Tszyu worked.  In the presentation, it looks very tasty and cost-effective, but 8 hours on the train to inspect this building - isn't this what is called a complete loss of connection with reality? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/048/ff2/a3a/048ff2a3afaf56aaaa225fc4d6a43337.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So it turns out that it‚Äôs not necessary to develop internal travel from the web, from the construction of new airports (by the way, who knows: how many of them have appeared in new cities in the last 5 years?) Or high-speed highways.  So, the society itself, without any extra stimulation by banners, will have the demand for everything in new mobile applications for choosing quick and comfortable trips inside the beloved country. <br><br>  <b>About the most tragic</b> <br><br>  I have one friend, a wonderful specialist, an excellent promotion expert, but also a perfect example of a person who does not feel the pain of others at all, does not let the real world perception of strangers into his cold heart.  So, in his project to promote the funeral agency, he tries to use all the same banal methods: create more identical pages, stuff more keywords and autotext into them, drag more people from search engines to the website by hook or by crook.  Kostya was lucky - he himself never experienced a real pain from the loss of someone he truly loved, and therefore in his head is simply unable to meet all this reality: <br><br>  <i>Noise in the head.</i>  <i>A feeling of complete unreality of what is happening, weakness in the hands, communication with phrases breaking in the half-words, a two-hour silent attempt to see the answer to a simple question in the light outside the window: ‚Äúhow and why to live further?‚Äù</i> <br><br>  And in this state, according to Kostya (and many similar cynical hipsters), the very first thing that anyone should supposedly do is go to Google and drive into the search something like ‚Äúelite turnkey funeral‚Äù or ‚Äúvelvet Brush to the coffin - for the action, have time right now. " <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/0PBz4Z5KoKw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg7Q8chLbZcasdMyXS0BCL7MmTsTQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Once again, absolutely heartbroken people in your usability scenarios are not asking for life ‚ÄúLord, for what,‚Äù I wouldn‚Äôt have left if he stayed, and even ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to do now,‚Äù but only an advertising-soulless ‚Äúdiscount on the funeral service, 23 hours and 59 minutes left‚Äù. <br><br>  We have become hardened, we have been mired in complacency, we have ceased to understand all those for whom and for whose benefit we were obliged to work.  We no longer catch the vibes tearing the people around us into real flour.  That is why our sites look like cardboard, and mobile applications are not alive. <br><br>  It will take a moment to think about it, but how could the funeral agency get closer to real people, without all this officialism and formalism?  Everything is simple: to respond in a timely manner to existing tragic infopovody, for example, to collect signatures, clothes, toys for victims in other regions on absolutely free basis.  Or even start a Live Support Journal, through which every Internet user could randomly support completely unfamiliar people by writing a few warm words to those who have now really lost their reason for living and believing in happiness (with full moderation). <br><br>  And then, when a single reflex will be created for every person in the whole city, ‚ÄúWhen it‚Äôs bad for everyone and everybody, it‚Äôs this agency with employees who are not indifferent to our pain‚Äù that will help you, ‚Äùand then it‚Äôs this memory sewn into the subconscious that will work when a personal tragedy begins , and not stretching over the road.  We will be closer to people, without Google, without keywords, without a site in general, but with the emotion of jointly overcoming real pain. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>- You do not believe in what you do.</i>  <i>Do not participate in the soul.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt participate,‚Äù said Tatarsky.</i>  <i>- Still would.</i>  <i>What do you want?</i>  <i>So that I ‚ÄúTampaco‚Äù let me into my soul?</i>  <i>Yes, no such bl *** from Pushkin Square will not do.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúYou just don‚Äôt need to be in a pose,‚Äù Hanin frowned.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúNo, no,‚Äù said Tatarsky, calming down, ‚Äúyou misunderstood me.‚Äù</i>  <i>The pose is the same for everyone now, you just have to position yourself correctly, right?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Right.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- So why am I saying that no bl *** will do?</i>  <i>The point here is not disgust.</i>  <i>Just bl *** in all cases gets the money - the client liked it or not, but I must first ...
