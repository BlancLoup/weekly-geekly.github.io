  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Useful and strange: 8 amazing ideas from the world of the Internet of things (+1)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We all love cool and unusual gadgets.  But sometimes in their desire to come up with something special, their inventors go too far.  On the creators of Internet startups have long been accusations that they often come up with something absurd and completely unnecessary people.  The Internet of things market is on the verge of a boom, and it looks like its participants will face the same fate. <br><br>  <b>How do you, for example, have the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãgetting shocked for a missed workout or reading books that mimic the sensations of a hero?</b>  Although, of course, not all ideas that seem strange at first have no right to exist.  Who knows how this will end? <br><br>  We decided to collect in one post the most unusual, bold and often frankly strange developments from the world of the Internet of things.  If you have something to add - welcome to the comments.

    <h4>  1. BRACELET FOR MAZOCHIST </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1b2/26a/dd7/1b226add71998e1d64a12cceb6eb85f1.png"><br><br>  There are many ways to motivate a person.  And if most fitness bracelets use pleasant stimuli, then the <a href="http://pavlok.com/">Pavlok Habit Forming Device</a> focuses not on carrot, but on the whip.  Seriously, the device will beat the owner with a small discharge of current if he starts otlynivat from the sport tasks set before him. <a name="habracut"></a>  Manish Network, the developer of the gadget, <a href="">explains</a> : "It's not a painful shock, but to form good habits and train the brain to achieve the set sport tasks."  Are there many willing to form habits in this frankly frikovsky way? <br><br><h4>  2. BOTTLE UNDER CONTROL </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fd0/249/6ce/fd02496ce420a9f7540b0ea4310ccd93.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://thehug.info/">Hug</a> is another electronic bracelet, not for your hand, but for a bottle of water.  The idea will probably especially please the control freaks and followers of the quantify self movement who are looking for non-trivial opportunities to track their progress in sports.  The developers <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/19/the-caktus-hug-sensor-makes-sure-youre-drinking-enough-water/">promise</a> that while you are busy, the device attached to the bottle will track how much and how often you drink.  Further on the bluetooth all the information goes to your smartphone, and the accompanying application will count each sip and compare this information with your age, weight and even the average temperature in the gym. <br><br><h4>  3. HEAD BUTTON </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/395/d22/e83/395d22e8341de0c254277951e7be0052.jpg"><br><br>  The <a href="http://shop.reebok.com/us/content/checklight">Reebok CheckLight balaclava is</a> designed for boxing, football and other sports, where it often comes to the head.  There are zero defenses against it, but the built-in sensors monitor the frequency and force of blows to the head.  If the number of blows is approaching a critical one, a red light comes on, signaling to coaches and judges that it is time to take care of health and give the poor fellow a breather. <br><br><h4>  4. PRANAYAMA-TRACKER </h4><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/MmYzQIioMf8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhvloyMLJE_DEO3cPLcw5OEfyXYqg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  At Kickstar, they just raised $ <a href="http://www.lumafit.com/">104,791</a> dollars to develop a fitness tracker <a href="http://www.lumafit.com/">Lumafit</a> , which combines a personal trainer and an electronic teacher of yoga.  <a href="http://www.geektime.com/2014/03/11/lumafit-a-new-bluetooth-style-fitness-tracker/">The device</a> , which is an ear clip with a built-in three-axis accelerometer, recognizes the movements of the owner.  That is, to give a trip to the refrigerator for a beer for push-ups will not work.  Moreover, the device is able to control the technique of the exercises and give advice on what needs to be corrected.  Also, the gadget tracks the slightest changes in the pulse and respiratory rate.  In yoga, it is the breathing exercises of pranayama - this is the first step to deep meditation, so Lumafit is positioned as an aid for beginner yogis.  Through the accompanying Bootcamp application, the owner will be able to independently develop his own training programs and plan time for meditation.  Will electronic gurus be able to compete with certified Hindus? <br><br><h4>  5. BOOK WITH SPECIAL EFFECTS </h4><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/JOndy5fue78&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhlAPSdMwPNhmvRWBE-jFSxeaf7gg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Why not artificially enhance the emotions that a person experiences while reading?  This question was <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/2/5370844/sensory-fiction-mit-media-lab-immersive-storytelling-concept">asked by</a> students of the MIT media laboratory and began to develop a book with the presence of Sensory Fiction.  In fact, these are two devices that exchange data - the book itself and the electronic vest that the reader wears.  <s>By the position of the eyes, the device tracks which particular paragraph the person is reading.</s>  Depending on the content, svetoidy in the book can be poured in different colors, and the vest to vibrate, simulating the heartbeat of the hero, create pressure and change the temperature.  So far, there is only a prototype of this device and it only works with the story ‚ÄúThe Girl That Connected‚Äù by the American author James Tiptree Jr.  It is a hapless suicide, whose consciousness serves to control the body, artificially created by scientists. <br><br><h4>  6. ONLINE NON-MANUAL </h4><br>  Wearing a <a href="http://www.electricfoxy.com/ping/">Ping</a> sleeveless jacket, you can go on the social network without a computer and a smartphone - sensors and microchips are sewn into the fabric, so the clothes react to movements.  The sleeveless jacket <a href="http://www.wired.com/2010/04/the-ping-social-networking-garment/">notifies</a> of a new comment or a message of a light shaking shoulder.  Included with a sleeveless is an application that will help customize all movements for themselves.  Google Glass is resting? <br><br><h4>  7. DIGITAL PIGAMA </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f0/c7b/261/2f0c7b2613f8b50e036ffa56f5d91e7f.jpg"><br><br>  At first glance, the children's PJ <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/technology/2013/04/smart-pjs-app-compatible-pajamas-for-bedtime-stories/">Smart PJ</a> looks quite standard, the look can catch on just a pattern of multi-colored dots.  All right - these are unique codes, scanning which parents will be able to download a new fairy tale on the phone and read it to the child.  QR codes never took root.  Is there any chance of coded pajamas? <br><br><h4>  8. TABLET FOR SPY </h4><br>  To gain access to the secret zone, you swallow a pill, it dissolves in your stomach, and when interacting with gastric juice, an 18-bit code appears in your body, recognized at a distance by special devices.  This is not Pelevin's invention, but one of <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2013/06/05/googles-motorola-may-give-you-tattoo-or-vitamin-password/">Motorola</a> 's <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2013/06/05/googles-motorola-may-give-you-tattoo-or-vitamin-password/">new developments</a> (for the time being, though, it has not been available for sale).  In the company itself, they prefer to call this type of interaction with security systems ‚ÄúVitamin authentication‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  +1  DREAMER FOR SLEEP </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/383/49e/933/38349e9334250205e23757ffb16093f5.png"><br><br>  This thing probably has nothing to do with the world of Internet things.  But the strangeness parameter is very suitable for the selection - it is super strange.  Although designed to solve the seemingly trivial task.  Studies show that a short nap in the middle of the day increases working capacity by about 30 percent.  Design bureau Kawamura Ganjavian together with the studio Banana Things came up with the <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/raznoe/ostrich-pillow-podushka-straus/">Ostrich Pillow</a> pillow for those who want to be able to take a nap comfortably anywhere.  The pillow looks like a soft ‚Äúdiving‚Äù cap, in which you can stick your head and hands.  Nothing is seen and nothing is heard - this universal object protects and isolates the mind, feelings and body.  For those who are shy to sleep in a diving cap in public places, the designers later offered a more socially acceptable version of the <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/raznoe/ostrich-pillow-light/">Ostrich Pillow Light</a> .  Both options ( <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/raznoe/ostrich-pillow-podushka-straus/">main</a> and <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/raznoe/ostrich-pillow-light/">light</a> ) can be bought from us in the store MadRobots. <br><br> <a href="https://twitter.com/MadrobotsRu"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac1/fc6/d2a/ac1fc6d2a19948c59791b0da6ab659df.gif"></a> <a href="http://vk.com/madrobots"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/933/ac3/0b6/933ac30b6fd24ffd82218148c2fb0917.gif"></a> <a href="http://instagram.com/madrobotsru"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/464/a82/e04/464a82e045a34bae81406fd0b640cf08.gif"></a> <a href="http://facebook.com/madrobotsrussia"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b5/542/136/0b55421365064901acdf0ed58cc4a111.gif"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63d/405/78e/63d40578ecbf48f28c62f57705c73eb6.gif"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/226185/">https://habr.com/ru/post/226185/</a></p>
