There are FTP clients, SSH, server control panels with built-in managers and a host of other methods.  One of these methods is web file managers working in a browser. <br><br>  In essence, web file managers don't really need anyone.  You hardly remember when you used it like this (managers in the CMS do not count).  Another thing, if you face a specific task, where the use of such a tool is justified.  We have just such a case.

      Today, I‚Äôll tell you why we‚Äôve embedded a file manager in antivirus for sites, how we did it, and how red dots help users get a clear picture of the infection. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Why do we need a file manager </h2><br>  We needed a tool that would visually show users a picture (structure, if you will) of infecting files on sites, and at the same time allow them to work with files.  In the scanning / disinfection reports, infected files have already been shown and you can go to edit them in the built-in editor, but here we are talking about another tool.  We needed something that would make the service more versatile. <br><br>  We decided to build a file manager into the service.  If threats were detected on the site, the affected files and directories would be marked with red markers.  It is clear, understandable and convenient.  With this tool, users could see the file structure of their sites and navigate through it, see problems, edit individual files.  This is a way to save time when you have a lot of sites on different servers. <br><br><h2>  How the manager works </h2><br>  Since user sites are already connected to the service, we can retrieve a list of their files and directories, and edit them remotely.  Like other tools, we placed the file manager on a separate layer.  When choosing a site from the general list, the manager turns on for this particular site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2e1/ff3/87c/2e1ff387c499407b8d3c286a0045e38c.jpg"><br><br>  Infected directories and files are marked with a red marker on the left.  So immediately it becomes clear the problem place in the file structure of the site.  From here, you can also add and exclude a file from the exclusion list (so that it is not checked by the antivirus), go to editing the contents and file permissions in the built-in editor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a43/9e3/146/a439e31467a04d1697b180dcd32f6685.jpg"><br><br>  All data from the user's site is transmitted through a synchronization file located on the site.  The content of the requested folder is transmitted as an array in JSON format each time the user opens the corresponding folder in the manager.  This array contains all the necessary information about files and folders: name, size, date of change, owner, group and rights.  Marks that the file is infected or the folder contains infected files are set based on the report on the last scan of the site, if there is one.  This report contains complete information about all infected files, the threats found in them and so on.  Based on this information, we also highlight the infected section of the code in the file editor.  All reports on scans are stored on our server, so we can always see the full picture of the infection of the site and display it in the file manager. <br><br>  Of course, we adapted the manager interface to the needs of the service, because we did not need a full-fledged file manager.  Important were only those functions that may be useful in the treatment of sites. <br><br>  We also adapted the navigation through the file structure to the mobile style.  It was important for us to save space, and a simplified conclusion allowed us to do this and the interface remained clear. <br><br><h2>  How well did it all </h2><br>  As a result, we have created a universal tool.  On the one hand, it shows a picture of infection more clearly than a scan / treatment report.  On the other hand, it can be used outside the context of treatment sites. <br><br>  We were interested to see how users began to use the file manager, regardless of whether their site is infected or not.  The manager has become an independent tool. <br><br>  Now the time of working with the file manager is 30% of the time spent by people in their <a href="https://virusdie.ru/">Virusoid</a> panel - a good UX indicator in our opinion. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/262177/">https://habr.com/ru/post/262177/</a></p>
