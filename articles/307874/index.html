The platform allows to attract funding for the development of creative and technological projects.  If you believe the statistics provided on the project site, to date, 1,186 projects have been implemented with the help of Boomstarter, and funds have been raised totaling 281 million rubles.  and 142,195 potential sponsors registered.  The commission of the platform is 5%, another 5% goes to payment systems and another 13% is charged as personal income tax.  To be placed on the platform, the project must have a ready-made prototype, a stated goal and a limited time frame for fundraising.  If the project does not collect the required amount by the deadline, all money is returned to the sponsors.  The rules of Boomstarter do not allow projects related to the collection of funds for personal needs (training, treatment, payment of purchases, etc.), opening their own business and charity.  Detailed information about the rules of the site can be found in a <a href="https://boomstarter.ru/help/guidelines">special section of the</a> site.

The <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/payonline/blog/305580/">global range of fintech accelerators</a> <br>  Issue 5. <b>Russian and foreign platforms for attracting collective funding</b> <br><br>  Crowdfunding and crowdinvesting platform <a href="https://planeta.ru/">Planeta.ru</a> , like Boomstarter, appeared in 2012, but 2 months earlier.  In accordance with the statistics posted on the official website of the platform, to date, 478,564,124 rubles have been raised with the help of Planeta.ru.  and implemented more than 2,000 projects.  The size of the commission Planeta.ru corresponds to Boomstarter.  In addition, the platform offers its participants a form of raising funds, such as <a href="https://planeta.ru/faq/article/25!paragraph163">crowdinvesting</a> , allowing users who have invested in the project to receive financial rewards. <br><br>  Separately, it is worth noting that both Boomstarter and Planeta.ru hold special events designed to train project founders in effective crowdfunding. <br><br>  It should be noted, and the project <a href="http://wavesplatform.com/">Waves</a> , in contrast to the above-mentioned platforms, demonstrated the capabilities of the blockchain technology for crowdfunding and crowdinvesting.  The project team is positioning its platform as a hybrid solution between p2p-investing and crowdfunding, able to challenge classic crowdfunding platforms.  The main advantage for users of the platform is stable dividends and the possibility of exiting the project without loss.  Fundraisers can organize fundraising at the expense of fiat currencies, bitcoins and tokens.  By the way, tokens (or crypto shares) issued on Waves can be traded on a special decentralized exchange with the support of a reputation system. <br><br>  According to the <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/how-to-build-a-successful-%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585-startup-in-2016-part-2/">LTP</a> edition, accelerators are able to provide companies with some financial support.  Nevertheless, their programs have their own terms, after which start-ups must show very good results in order to receive further funding.  As a rule, in order to attract new funds at this stage, company founders have to choose between crowdfunding, arranging personal loans and, of course, using venture investors. <br><br>  We also suggest that you familiarize yourself with some foreign <a href="http://letstalkpayments.com/top-10-online-crowdfunding-platforms-for-startups/">crowdfunding platforms</a> , where newly-minted entrepreneurs can start their big journey: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/26c/d95/f49/26cd95f49ee2412397bf624d7ccd542c.png" alt="image"><br>  <a href="http://letstalkpayments.com/crowdfunding-platform-circleup-raises-30-million-series-c-funding/">CircleUp</a> is a leading crowdfunding platform where accredited investors get direct access to investing their own capital in fast-growing consumer products and private retailers that were previously inaccessible or little-known.
