But in order to move from ‚Äúbrilliant developments‚Äù to their practical implementation, it turns out that money is also needed.  And so, in the life of the "Edison" and "Kulibin" begin endless ordeals to search for these "miserable" amounts.  The carriers of ‚Äúpricelessness‚Äù go to various instances and institutions, knock about the thresholds of state or private departments in order to find a generous investor for their start-up, who ‚Äúwill certainly fall to such a promising offer‚Äù as it is presented personally to the ‚Äúfather of the revolutionary development‚Äù and lay out round numbers. <br><br>  However, as a rule, this huge mass of walkers everywhere is faced with a cold ‚Äúlack of understanding‚Äù among potential investors.  And only a few from this ocean are suffering and seeking to enjoy the happiness of being showered with the desired rain of money, albeit, sometimes on very subservient conditions, but, though, the idea does not die. <br><br>  Why is this happening?  Is this normal and how can this negative statistics be reversed in a different direction?  This will be the topic of our conversation after kata. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Let's start with the fact that, despite their ‚Äúcreative brains‚Äù, inventors, as practice shows, are poorly versed in things that can really give life to their offspring.  The fact is, probably, that, being completely absorbed in the search for some business angels, they do not think or realize that the reason for their failures may lie in themselves.  I myself went through all the circles of this hell, until good friends shared with me quite simple, but very effective principles that should be followed when interacting with potential investors.  I am sure that they can help all those who repeat my bad experience.  For myself, I called them the "Approaches of Hoxha Nasreddin." <br><br>  Many probably remember the adventures of the fairytale folklore hero of Eastern legends, Khoja Nasreddin.  One day, passing over a bridge over a reservoir, he saw dekhkans shouting to some drowning man who fell from a bridge into the water: ‚ÄúCome on, give your hand ...‚Äù But, sinking, though floundering, periodically going under the water, stretch his arms did not want to.  Then Hodja, having learned who exactly is drowning, went to the edge of the bridge, stretched out his hand with his hand clenched into a fist and shouted: ‚ÄúOn, take it!‚Äù And, miraculously, the sinking grasped Nasreddin‚Äôs hand and was thus saved.  It was the mullah, whose mentality was sharpened not at all to ‚Äúgive‚Äù, but exactly to just ‚Äútake‚Äù.  Here, the favorite of the Eastern people took advantage of Principle No. 1, which sounds like: ‚Äú <b>On, take it!</b>  " <br><br>  So, you know, the reflexes of your potential investors are very similar to the very reaction of the mullah, because the rich man‚Äôs mentality is not at all tuned to your enrichment and not to personally satisfy your ambitions, but he works exclusively to satisfy the mercantile needs of his master.  Unfortunately, Mother Teresa has already died and she has to be guided by reality.  Therefore, going to the investor, who for some reason is called a ‚Äúbusiness angel‚Äù, you should remember that the capitalist DOES NOT GIVE, but only buys ‚Äúcheaply‚Äù in order to sell it later ‚Äúfor dearly‚Äù.  Therefore, you need to adapt to his mentality and when meeting him you just need to say: ‚Äú <b>Take, I brought and give you this wealth!</b>  " <br><br>  Any other start, a different entry into a business relationship with a possible financier of your projects will cut you off the path of ascent to the desired Olympus, that is, the desired investment. <br><br>  This truly magical phrase serves as the key to the castle on the way to the heart of the investor.  But, unfortunately, the key, although necessary, but still far from sufficient, not the last. <br><br>  This approach of Nasreddin, as Princip No. 2, says: ‚Äú <b>Put yourself in the place of an investor</b> ‚Äù.  That is, start thinking like him, go into his skin. <br><br>  Your potential investor understands not a damn thing of the essence of what has come into your ingenious head.  But he is good at arithmetic and knows how to clearly knock on the buttons of a calculator, calculating a complex percentage of the nested "blood". <br><br>  It is absolutely important for the capitalist to clearly understand to himself how much, when and how he will return the investment and start receiving his profit.  This money bag is not at all interesting that you have found the original solution in some completely breathtakingly unique way that gives a strong aesthetic pleasure to other gourmets of ‚Äúcreative thought‚Äù. <br><br>  He just needs to understand whether this your ‚Äúlittle idea‚Äù will be in demand among buyers and what is its consumer market?  Will your product or service be able to find its niche in a crowded market, even by pushing other competitors who have long been present at this ‚Äúsunflower place‚Äù? <br><br>  For such a concrete assessment of your offspring, the investor has ‚Äúhis own market experts‚Äù who, even if they are a little funny in your presentation drawings and charts, very clearly (from your point of view) demonstrating and proving effective performance and quick profit from the innovation that you have presented. of the project, however, in 99.99% of cases they will still give a NEGATIVE verdict, since they, these experts, are sitting in a rather warm place with a decent salary and do not want to risk their position before the boss until  TCRs do not see already unwinding the firm, with with growing by leaps and bounds income, which in fact, you have not yet, and even if this was, you would not have come to ask for money from this miser. <br><br>  At the same time, it is necessary to know that the investor has one ‚Äúreinforced concrete criterion‚Äù, which he uses for market valuations.  Your future product or service should be EXCLUDED from the market by another already-promoted brand, clearly valued in sales parameters by day, month and year.  This can happen in only one case, when your products or services, with all other relatively equal evaluations, in all possible key qualitative and quantitative indicators can differ from those on the market of their closest competitive counterpart in one key component - they should be HALF.  Only then can your potential investor open a second lock and his hand will start moving to the place where his money lies, which he has already prepared to give you. <br><br>  However, on the way, he instinctively stops his movement, so another lock hangs there, and will click on other specialists, now ‚Äúrisk experts‚Äù.  These figures are the most dangerous for you.  They can bring back the hand of their chief, who, it seems, has finally leaned in your direction.  Therefore, you need to know about the third approach of Nasreddin, who declares: ‚Äú <b>Create a background of confidence</b> .‚Äù <br><br>  It must be remembered that, practically, any investor is constantly shaking about possible risks, because of which he may irretrievably lose his investment.  And this is his such state is not the best background in which the desired money is sought.  Therefore, according to the Nasreddin Principle No. 3, you should create with the potential financier COMPLETE CONFIDENCE that, at the very least, his money will by no means be lost.  How to do this, all your fantasy should manifest here, since the option you choose strongly depends directly on the essence of your innovation. <br><br>  But there is one trick that can be called universal.  Think over and offer an investor a phased implementation plan for your entire project.  Start with a small area, volume, node ..., with what requires minimal investment, and then, in two or three stages, scale the development of the project to its full market implementation. <br><br>  Good luck to you! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147892/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147892/</a></p>
