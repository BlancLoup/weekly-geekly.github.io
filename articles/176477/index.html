We were very pleased to find and translate <a href="http://unbounce.com/landing-pages/checklist/">an article</a> in which the author outlined all the requirements that such a page should meet.  But there is in this article and a big minus.  There are already 50 points, each can be noted in the checklist, but after that only the result is available in points, which you can only boast to your friends. <br><br>  We are against such methods of analyzing information.  Therefore, anyone can download the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/alconost.com/spreadsheet/ccc%3Fkey%3D0ApqIHJqErY4HdHo3RkxzaXpzbE43Q3dCNF9VYl9zTVE">Google table</a> prepared by us, answer the questions ‚ÄúYes‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo‚Äù, filter the answers and get the result and plan of action. <br><br>  Those who do not want to go to the guglot table, we ask under the cat.  There is a translation.

Maybe.  Probably.  Maybe not.  Most of the landing pages - <a href="http://unbounce.com/landing-page-examples/your-landing-page-sucks/">sucks</a> , and it is very easy to conduct an unsuccessful marketing campaign.  But not necessarily everything should happen that way. <br><br>  Recognizing that you need help is the first step to improving your page.  But how to do that?  After all, this is not the case when you can just go through the program of 12 steps.  Although, in general, there is such a <a href="http://unbounce.com/landing-pages/landing-page-rehab/">program</a> .  But in order to give meaning to this post, let's imagine that it does not exist. <br><br><h2>  Using checklist </h2><br>  To determine how good your landing page is, note for yourself everything that has already been done on the page and get the result (we hope it is solid).  So you will see how good or bad your page is, and of those items that will remain unchecked, you will be able to collect instructions on what you need to do to make the page even better. <br><br>  <i>Note: if the item is not applicable to you (for example, it mentions a video or a form that is not on your page), mark it.</i> <br><br><ol><li>  Does the title of your landing page match your advertising message? </li><li>  Is the focus of your landing page focused on one goal? </li><li>  Can a casual person understand this goal in 5-10 seconds?  (Check) </li><li>  Is it clear what kind of company you are and what you do?  (Logo and slogan) </li><li>  Do you have a simple supporting description that reinforces the title? </li><li>  Do you use bulleted lists to describe the benefits of your product / service? </li><li>  Is there a relevant and original title image or video that shows your product / service in action?  (Context of use) </li><li>  Is the page of your page as intelligible and clear as the 30-second elevator presentation (elevator pitch)?  (Read someone‚Äôs text from your page and see if they are understandable) </li><li>  Is your main heading formulated to answer the question: ‚ÄúWhat is this page about?‚Äù </li><li>  Have you eliminated all external links (such as global site navigation) to prevent the outflow of visitors? </li><li>  Does your landing page explain what your product / service is unique about?  (USP) </li><li>  Does the description focus more on benefits than on characteristics? </li><li>  Did you refrain from requesting optional information in the form?  Be absolutely honest because it is bad.  (If you do not have a form on the page, check this box) </li><li>  Do you explain the value or scale of your lead generating action (discount amount, number of e-book pages, monetary equivalent)? </li><li>  Do you provide usage examples and feedback from users of your product / service?  (Recommendations and other trust factors) </li><li>  Do you provide several ways to contact you (telephone, email, chat)? </li><li>  Do you give the user a clear understanding of what he will receive by clicking on your call to action (CTA)? </li><li>  Does your landing page have a professional design? </li><li>  Does the design of your landing page match the visual style of your promotional materials?  (Banners) </li><li>  Does this design match the style of your main website or brand?  (Applicable only if there is a call to action) </li><li>  Do you use lightboxes that give the visitor the opportunity to get additional information without leaving the page? </li><li>  Do you have a link to privacy policy and / or terms of use? </li><li>  Do you provide test samples of promotional items (for example, a preview of the first section of the book), if applicable to you? </li><li>  Do you demonstrate certification, partner logos or security proofs (like Verisign)? </li><li>  Is it possible to check your statements and given facts? </li><li>  Do you repeat your proposal in the form to make it clearer, why fill it in? </li><li>  Do you use visual pointers (gaze direction or graphical arrows) to draw attention to the call to action? </li><li>  Is the call-to-action element large enough to stand out on the page when looking at it from a distance of one and a half meters? </li><li>  Is this element a contrast? </li><li>  Is it in a prominent position at the top of the page? </li><li>  Do you place it next to the email address field?  mail in the form of a link to privacy policy? </li><li>  Do you use the confirmation page to give the new visitor instructions on how to proceed?  (Share this page, follow our updates, download another book for free, sign up for this webinar ...) </li><li>  If your offer is limited by time, do you understand this to encourage immediate action by visitors? </li><li>  Do you create a separate landing page for each source of calls (email, social networks, PPC) to see which one will give the highest conversion? </li><li>  If you use video, did you give up on autoplay, giving control of the playback to the visitor? </li><li>  Does your video end with a call to action? </li><li>  Have you reduced the number of calls to action on your page to one?  (If the page is long, then you can repeat it) </li><li>  If you call people to register for the webinar, do you show the number of people who have already registered as social evidence? </li><li>  Do not tick this box if you have a pop-up window on exit. </li><li>  Do you do A / B testing on your pages? </li><li>  Do you request feedback from your users to use in preparing the next test? </li><li>  If you have a multistage process (for example, registration), do you make it understandable for visitors?  (30 seconds, 3 steps, etc.) </li><li>  Have you optimized your landing page so that your search advertising quality score is rated above 7? </li><li>  Do you use separate landing pages for each promotion / campaign? </li><li>  Have you tested using a short page versus using a long page to determine how much information your visitors need for conversion? </li><li>  Does your landing page follow the principle of unity when each element of the page explains a single concept? </li><li>  Did you provide the maximum simplicity and clarity of the text on your landing page?  (Remove 50% of the source text, then cut it down to half what remains) </li><li>  Do not check this item if the button on your form says "Click here" or "Send". </li><li>  If you use a form, did you put it on a colored plate so that it clearly stands out as the most important part of the page? </li><li>  And finally: have you ever used unbounce?  (Could not help but ask). </li></ol><br>  We hope this translation will be useful to you, Habrazhiteli.
