But there will be figures collected at the end of last year.  Now we are making a new review with the team, but for now read what came out and understand that the world has gone crazy without your participation.  Long and immediately :) <br><br>  The next important point: the figures are in dollars, although they are often given in ETH, BTC.  But uniformly considered easier and more correct, is not it?  Now the cryptocurrency rate is very different, say, from the autumn of 2017, so everything is sometimes worse in some cases.

      <b>The task of the article is simple: to show the inadequacy of the ICO market today and to suggest ways for its normalization in the future.</b>  <b>Sometimes it succeeded.</b> <br><br>  So let's get started? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Cryptoconsulting.ru</b> <br><br>  On the main one there is minimalism and a simple definition: ‚Äúa comprehensive solution for effectively attracting investments in your project‚Äù. <br><br>  Services are simple to ugliness: <br><br><ol><li>  PR ICO: min - 12 800 / "the best offer" - 50 000 </li><li>  ICO plan - from 250 </li><li>  Token creation - from 1 160 </li><li>  Website for ICO - 3 200 </li></ol><br>  The team also offers additional services: technical support, the creation of video clips, etc. <br><br>  <b>Maxcap-ico.com</b> <br><br>  The numbers here are extremely simple and understandable (though not for everyone: especially not for those who have not deeply immersed in this market: what is considered to be ‚Äúsmall amounts‚Äù here - in fact, the sums are just large and sometimes even substantial): <br><ol><li>  PR Online - 150,000 </li><li>  Launch of advertising channels - 57 950 </li><li>  Work with funds - 33 000 </li><li>  Commerce Management - 5,000 </li><li>  Chat bot - 5 000 </li><li>  PR campaign - 45 000 </li><li>  PR Offline - 70,000 </li><li>  Video Production - 40 000 </li><li>  Setting up advertising channels - 17 000 </li><li>  Bounty Campaign - 5,000 </li><li>  Website development - 4 000 </li><li>  WP Writing - 7,000 </li><li>  Smart contract - 13 000 </li><li>  Content Marketing - 7,000 </li></ol><br>  Thus, the total budget is 458,950: almost half a million dollars is not bad, is it not? <br><br>  It bothers me, and quite a bit like this: Sosnovkino, Dao.casino, Erachain - projects that the service can ‚Äúboast‚Äù.  Confused here for whatever reason - <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/335728/">https://habrahabr.ru/post/335728/</a> .  I think the reasons are clear? <br><br>  <b>Bitpride-ico.ru</b> <br><br>  Immediately we will plunge into the prices, and then - into another aspect that few people pay attention to (unfortunately): <br><br><ol><li>  Pre-ICO - 5,800 </li><li>  Industry analytics and token structure creation - 1 500 </li><li>  Website creation in Russian and English languages ‚Äã‚Äã- 5 250 </li><li>  Translation of a site into another language - 600 </li><li>  WP in Russian and English languages ‚Äã‚Äã- 5 000 </li><li>  WP translation to other languages ‚Äã‚Äã- 1,500 </li><li>  Creating a clip - 2 500 </li><li>  Creating a smart contract - 2 500 </li><li>  Blogging in English - 1,700 </li><li>  Creating and maintaining project communities in social networks - 1 700 </li><li>  Publications in the media - 10 000 </li><li>  Advertising in telegram channels - 7 500 </li><li>  Placing on ICO trackers - 8 500 </li><li>  Targeted advertising on Facebook.com (setting) - 1 200 </li><li>  Facebook Budget - 5,000 </li><li>  Google Contextual Advertising - 1,200 </li><li>  Budget for Google - 5 000 </li><li>  The cost of setting up advertising Youtube - 3 400 </li><li>  Youtube Budget - 5,000 </li><li>  Hidden marketing in Telegram chat rooms - 6,700 </li><li>  Development and implementation of the Bounty - 3 500 </li><li>  Project Presentation to Funds - 3,500 </li></ol><br>  And now - speaking, for me at least, a screenshot: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fl/sm/vm/flsmvm5i0q0srocixu1ailegmvk.png"><br><br>  You can thresh a lot of water, rotate the air and shake even rocks, but the fact remains: PR ICO has become incredibly expensive ($ 30,000,000 of collected funds goes up to 1.5 for marketing) and will be even more expensive, but the final fees depend on professional help. , but not only and not even so many marketers: <br><br>  Firstly, to the great misfortune of lawyers: look at Filecoin and their thoughtful way of raising funds from profinvestors and everything will become clear (if not, wait for the material - it will be published soon); <br>  Secondly, if Bitcoin and Efir are expensive and give their interest without investing in ICO - the latter are simply not needed by anyone, therefore the end of 2017 - the beginning of 2018 was terrible for many projects; <br>  Thirdly, marketing for 2017 is so much bored by many that effective work with funds (and this will also be a separate article) gives far more than pseudo-crowdinvesting: especially if you take into account the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/346796/">‚Äúportrait of the average reliant‚Äù</a> . <br><br>  By the way, the guys from Bitpride take, among other things, 4% of the fees: not much, but sometimes lower (1-3% or 10% of the success-fee of the team).  The cost of traffic in this case will be from 35 000 dollars. <br><br>  <b>Icobroker.ru</b> <br><br>  Honestly, I saw them in directo and since then I did not understand.  Not accepted.  This is what the guys write on their site: the White paper prototype will cost 2,500, the PR campaign from 900, and they also create websites.  In addition, the following services are available: company registration for an international ICO;  International ICO budget - from 3%. <br><br>  Finding out information is not easy at all: this is in a market that is built on openness, therefore, without further comment. <br><br>  <b>Itolab.io</b> <br><br>  It uses the standard marketing technique - selling packages.  I will describe them in more detail: <br><br>  <b>‚Ññ1.</b>  <b>Integration package - 15 900</b> .  What is included? <br><br><ol><li>  Market research and analysis for a product </li><li>  Development of the business model of the project </li><li>  Development of the financial model of the project </li><li>  Integration of blockchain technology into the project </li><li>  Research and calculation of the project tokenomics </li><li>  Analysis of specific parameters for WP development </li><li>  Introduction of the FOMO-approach to the project </li><li>  Roadmap design and project implementation schedule </li><li>  Defining a legal token model </li><li>  WP Development </li><li>  WP Design </li><li>  WP English Translation </li></ol><br>  <b>‚Ññ2.</b>  <b>Technology Package base - 9 500</b> .  What is included? <br><br><ol><li>  Website creation </li><li>  Creating an investor cabinet </li><li>  Opening cryptocars </li><li>  Creating a project video </li><li>  Website translation into foreign languages </li></ol><br>  <b>Number 3.</b>  <b>Technology package Smart - 20 000</b> .  What is included? <br><br><ol><li>  Selection of blockchain platform and ecosystem </li><li>  Design and creation of an ecosystem on the blockchain platform </li><li>  Financial Logic Programming </li><li>  Smart Contract Development </li><li>  Issue tokens </li><li>  Security audit </li><li>  Adaptation of the existing project ecosystem with the system created on the blockchain platform </li></ol><br>  <b>All4ico.io</b> <br><br>  There are only three interaction models on this resource.  I will describe them: <br><br><ol><li>  Expensive with a minimum of risk - ALL4ICO services + ALL4ICO contractors (lawyers and marketing with experience in ICO).  Cost ... <b>ATTENTION!</b>  - 1,000,000 perpetually dead but famous Americans; </li><li>  With a cost lower, the risks are higher - ALL4ICO + services are part of ALL4ICO contractors (some of the work is either removed, accepting risks, or it is the customer‚Äôs contractors): option 2 is cheaper than option 1 depending on the number of selected contractors and accepted risks; </li><li>  the budget approach, the highest risks are the customers' contractors + ALL4ICO services and the ‚Äútotal‚Äù cost is 85,000. </li></ol><br>  From the nuances that deserve attention - two months of the event post ICO! <br><br>  <b>Pack.df.agency</b> <br><br>  An office with a solid, but at the same time - very (and very!) Controversial list of projects, including: Waves, Starta, Zrcoin (I have already spoken about the latter more than once). <br><br>  Here you can find the package offer - ‚ÄúICO PACK‚Äù for unfortunate 3 BTC, to which you should add 3% of the amount of fees, and another 3% of tokens.  The package itself includes: <br><br><ol><li>  Consulting </li><li>  Traffic </li><li>  Investor Cabinet and Token </li></ol><br>  The price in dollars is not ‚Äúclear‚Äù, but I think that it is not worth hoping for less than $ 30,000 and all the related fees. <br><br>  <b>Icosetup.ru</b> <br><br>  Now there are packages in rubles: 120,000, 450,000, 800,000 rubles.  In dollars, they looked like this: <br><br>  <b>‚Ññ1.</b>  <b>Start package - 2 000</b> <br><br><ol><li>  Plan development </li><li>  Writing whitepaper </li><li>  Site creation </li><li>  Waves platform token </li><li>  Placement in free listings </li><li>  contextual advertising </li></ol><br>  <b>‚Ññ2.</b>  <b>Package Standard (Start Plus) - 7 500:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  Placement in free listings </li><li>  Placed listings </li><li>  SMM </li><li>  contextual advertising </li><li>  E-mail newsletter </li><li>  Feedback for ICO </li><li>  Promotional video for ICO </li></ol><br>  <b>Number 3.</b>  <b>Premium Package (Standard and Plus) - 13 500:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  Bounty campaign </li><li>  Feedback for ICO </li><li>  Promotional video for ICO </li><li>  Media Publishing </li><li>  Funds conversion </li></ol><br>  <b>Bc-ico.com</b> <br><br>  In this case, the prices are not so detailed, but still - you can find something: <br><ol><li>  Project packaging - 2 000 </li><li>  Cryptocurrency creation - from 150 to 3500 </li><li>  Project promotion - 1,500 to 150,000 </li><li>  Turnkey ICO - from 50,000 </li></ol><br>  <b>Now - a few more projects in one line:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  <b>Ecommerce-payments.com</b> - ICO runs from 50,000, as well as a marketing campaign; </li><li>  <b>Icofor.me</b> - creating and configuring tokens, linking wallets from 800, consulting and reviewing a project - from 7,000;  conclusion to ICO - from 50,000; </li><li>  <b>Ico-go.ru</b> - Pre ICO holding - from 9,900; </li><li>  <b>Icobox.io</b> is a team that started to be healthy, and ended up with ‚Äú70 people for 80 projects‚Äù and costing 350,000. No comments </li></ol><br>  Total, "... more than 83% of ICO without professional help will never collect the stated amounts" - as one of the participants in today's research says, but whether everyone will collect with such help is a big question.  You need to consider if you want to go to the ICO with the following factors: <br><br><ul><li> The four main target groups (crypto activists, speculators, miners and "weak hands") are not investing as intensively as they used to: first, the cryptocurrency market is not trillions, and secondly, most of the turnover is inside the exchanges, which just not on the primary placement of tokens; </li><li>  In marketing, you buy traffic, among other things, but it is different from month to month: now, let's say (and yes - this will also be a separate article), Bounty has almost no normal conversion, whereas a year ago this part of the ICO campaign was very and very profitable; </li><li>  The main thing is that many people defy projects that I personally would be ashamed of, and some do not hesitate to show even those with whom they did not have a relationship (I will make an update as soon as the information is confirmed). </li></ul><br>  Therefore - <a href="https://vc.ru/27263-rynok-kriptovalyut-i-ico-v-cifrah">follow the market</a> , read the right books and, as they say on YouTube, subscribe to my <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/menaskop/">blog</a> <s>channel</s> and may the Force be with you! <br><br>  Before! <br><br>  <i>PS Thank you for compiling a team analyst - I. Malashkevich</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/347570/">https://habr.com/ru/post/347570/</a></p>
