  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The birth of an idea. How to invent a bicycle.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Everyone can come up with an idea.  We do this every day, without exception, sometimes just not noticing what happened.  But do such ideas have a future?  Let's take a closer look at specific examples. <br><br>  We woke up early in the morning in a terrible mood and, barely tearing my eyes, went to the kitchen to pour myself coffee.  Thoughts of a crisis, yesterday's binge drinking, a broken TV, and a stunned domain name are pulsating in your head, contrary to your corporation‚Äôs universal plan.  Familiar condition?  Submitted? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  You take out an empty mug, open a can of coffee, put your favorite "Neskafi" in its usual strict proportion.  Then you open the sugar bowl and do the same operation itself.  A boiled kettle makes you flinch and now you pour boiling water into a mug.  Morning begins as usual and suddenly "BAZ"!  You intuitively feel that all is not as good as it should be.  What happened?  If you give in to your thoughts, you have mixed up the proportions of sugar, water and coffee, as a result of which an unusable drink was gurgling in the mug.  Offensively?  The heat of your emotions reaches its limit.  You throw a mug at the wall, loudly remember ‚Äúthat same mother‚Äù and begin the brewing ritual from the beginning. <br><br>  <em>Of course, the example is sucked from the finger and has little to do with reality, but in this case, we just needed something abstract, without reference to ordinary events.</em>

      <br>
      We continue: <br><br>  A thought appears in your head: ‚ÄúTo click with your fingers and it all would be poured and brewed‚Äù ... And so she was born!  Idea!  You quit your breakfast, call the workplace to tell the boss about a very long and unpleasant ‚ÄúPups Winnipoups disease‚Äù that suddenly struck you for the next month and sit down at the blueprints.  The device must turn the world.  It will be in demand around the world, making life easier for you.  After an hour of thought and play with a ruler and compass, you get a more or less finished drawing that reflects the principle of operation of the main components of the device.  The design is striking in its simplicity and genius. <br><br>  You immediately rush into the pantry, grab the jigsaw and start to cut the prototype out of the lid from the old system unit in jerky jerks, passing along borrowing parts, breaking the electric kettle, grandmother's iron and the old sewing machine.  Voila!  You tenderly hold the device in your hands, stick it into the socket, fill the containers with the necessary ingredients and with Einstein's smile watch a delicious, mathematically adjusted drink flow into the cup.  Beauty!  In my mind, thoughts of world domination, an island in the Pacific Ocean, mulatto concubines and his own janitor, by the name of Gates, who came to you with an outstretched hand due to low IT revenues, begin to slip. <br><br>  Opening the box of champagne, you are immersed in alcoholic euphoria, launching firecrackers, balls and throwing small change out of the window leaves in favor of the poor.  The next day, in the mailbox, among a mountain of utility bills, you find a flyer that shows a coffee maker and you fall into permanent depression. <br><br>  <strong>And now, without extra water, let's sum up, based on our situation:</strong> <br><br><ol><li>  Even if it seems to you that the newborn idea is brilliant - believe me, this is not so.  The secret of the genius of the idea is a long and systematic breastfeeding, so that something can grow from a fluffy blind germ from 90x60x90.  The feeding analogy is not accidental.  Like a child, to determine the genius of an idea at such an early stage is simply impossible (with very few exceptions).  An idea is just a figment of your imagination - do not become its victim. <br>  _ </li><li>  Never proceed to the realization of your idea until you weigh all the ‚ÄúPros‚Äù and ‚ÄúCons‚Äù, and also do not go through the Internet and real-life for analogy.  Maybe what you came up with already exists?  If so, do not despair.  In fact, it is full of examples when things created according to similar ideas cohabit with each other, benefiting people and ‚Äúdumplings‚Äù to the creators.  In our case, it would be possible to produce coffee makers with a device that would turn on the heating of the clap.  Conveniently?  Is there a highlight?  And the demand will be, what do you think? <br>  _ </li><li>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe success of an idea should always be with you.  It seems crazy, but nevertheless it is.  The person who buys your product (will use it) should feel that he cannot do without it.  If, at the design stage, you begin to doubt that the thing may be useless, then the consumer will also have the same doubt.  If you are at least a day disappointed in what you have come up with - drop it, or put it in the back box. <br>  _ </li><li>  Try turning your idea around.  Sometimes this way you can come up with very interesting things.  For example, in our case, we can assume the existence of a device that does not make coffee according to strictly specified criteria, but on the contrary, it allocates sugar from unfinished coffee, which saves the product.  In this case, it sounds absurd, but sometimes really working and most importantly extraordinary ideas can appear. <br>  _ </li><li>  Calculate the cost of implementation.  Sometimes a great thing that all of humanity really needs + a pair of sullen Hippo is overpriced, as it requires a lot of production costs and consists of super-expensive components.  If this is true, try turning it into a chip.  For example, let our coffee maker is going to nude virgins near a frozen spring in the vicinity of an abandoned monastery.  There may be people who will pay for it, but the implementation of such a coffee maker will be unlike more difficult than usual. <br>  _ </li></ol><br><br>  <strong>We summarize:</strong> <br><br>  The birth of an idea is a natural process that occurs in our head due to a combination of various factors.  Being able to use this feature of the brain, people have learned everything that they can now.  If you learn to properly feed ideas, then even those that seem the most insane will bear fruit. <br><br>  Please do not judge strictly.
