  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Commonplace ergonomic elements of web services</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The time of validity of my bank card at VTB24 came to an end.  A month before the end, I received a letter with a notification about this fact and an offer to issue an application for reissue of the card via the Internet.  Great customer care, follow the link.  But then the circus begins. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ol><li>  There is no parsing of card numbers.  Maybe I'm wrong, but it seems that the number of digits in the card number is stable, so why not make at least a check on their number, so that the user immediately knows if he missed one digit? </li><li>  In the list of regions for which you can choose a bank office serving the card is Moscow, the Moscow Region and the Regions of the Russian Federation.  Okay, figs with him, they were too lazy to smash the cities, they will tolerate them, but why not sort the list of all the offices of the regions of the Russian Federation by cities?  Now it is sorted according to the abbreviation type office-name or office-city number, that is, I have to read a bunch of text to make sure that this is not my city.  When I made out a month ago, however, it was worse.  The offices of Yekaterinburg, Central and Akademichesky, Yekaterinburg were located at a noticeable distance, more lexicographical sorting.  But the work is underway, a month ago the sorting was lousy and there were no half of the offices of our city, now the sorting is better, but there is not a single office of our city (or I did not find it). </li><li>  To reissue a card, you must specify in which office it is serviced.  I have no idea in which office my card is served, I received it in one office, and changed it last time in another.  Moreover, it is impossible to drive an office with pens, and neither one nor the other is in the drop-down list.  In fact, everything is a little funnier, you can drive in with pens, there is a field, it is allowed to write.  But after you type and press ‚ÄúNext‚Äù, the address of the selected office will be automatically substituted. </li><li>  Separately, you must specify the office to which you need to deliver.  Why they can‚Äôt see at which office my card is served, and I can‚Äôt tell just where to deliver it is a mystery.  The second joke is that the input of this address is only handles, no drop-down list.  That is, open extra.  page, look at the name of the desired office, what is its address and copy it.  Although if this is a temporary solution, a normal list of all branches has not yet been formed - I am for.  I do not want to shove through half the city just because of the fact that someone (still) has not entered the desired item in the list. </li><li>  After entering all the data I was transferred to the page where it was written that the application was accepted, the operator will contact me to confirm it.  OK, waiting.  A few days later it comes, what would you think, a letter stating that my card expires and that I can issue an application on their website.  I make out.  A few days later - right, the letter.  Having missed several more letters yesterday, I reached the office with my legs with the aim of writing a statement.  And he found that both statements from me had passed, the card was released and, fortunately for me.  Just yesterday, she came, so I will be given her and all nishtyak. </li></ol><br><br>  No, I even believe that it takes time for every sorting and in a day or two I would be called and told that the map is ready and you can take it, there are no complaints.  I even understand the operations officer, who said that they were tormented to ring up and confirm, especially since I don‚Äôt really need this call anyway, they will call at the most inconvenient time.  But is it really difficult to send a letter that my data is really taken for processing?  Or at least stop sending letters that the card ends?  Riddle. <br><br>  At the same time six months ago, when I re-released this card for the first time, there were no problems.  After that, Lebedev‚Äôs studio took over the design of the bank‚Äôs website.  And the telebank there also became uncomfortable.  Hi, Tema. </div>
