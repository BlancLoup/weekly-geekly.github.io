  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Our IT education - is it possible to squeeze the most out of the minimum?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On the topic of domestic IT education on Habr√© many articles have already been written.  There were full critics of the article, convincing us of the low quality of education, also came across laudatory ones.  People shared their stories, compared our education with foreign ones, and offered approaches to improving the situation.  Among the participants of the discussion of articles clearly stood out those who believe that education at the university is not necessary, and those who believe that without him nowhere.  I want to share with you my vision of the need to study at a university, as well as highlight what for some reason remains behind the scenes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To be honest, before entering the institute I didn‚Äôt ask myself whether I should get a higher education at all.  It so happened that training in grade 11 was held at a specialized school at one of our well-known technical universities, where I also wanted to enroll.  So I didn‚Äôt have the problem of choosing an institute - I passed the documents to only one university and did not even try others. <br><br>  Yes, the very first semesters of education have shown that not everything is in order with education.  There were both backward laboratory stands and teachers who had little knowledge of the subject.  However, in the meantime, there were good examples - teachers who sincerely tried to teach us something.  This mainly concerned the fundamental and other serious sciences.  There were also those who tried to educate the individual of us. <br><br>  As a result, I had a dilemma: ‚ÄúWhat to do next?  How to make your education really effective?  I decided not to pay attention to ‚Äúdark spots‚Äù and at the beginning of each semester I attended several lectures on each subject and concluded that I needed it.  So the choice stopped on several subjects which were really interesting to me.  There was a little time for self-development.

      Almost always, when I was fond of any subject, I had friends and teachers who willingly met, they were not indifferent (a bow to them for that).  So they say correctly that if a student is ready, there will be a teacher (and friends). <br><br>  At the same time, I found a not very stressful job in my specialty.  This helped me to understand what work in a team is, but under mild conditions.  Then it was decided to go ahead and "complicate" their training.  Does the lab seem boring?  Make it more interesting.  Almost all the tasks we were supposed to perform on the computer.  Just at that moment, the .NET Framework appeared and without any special experience in programming (C ++, Pascal, later El-76 at the university level), I became interested and began to independently study, and at the same time do coursework and labs on .NETe (if possible) .  In the end, so I combined education and self-education. <br><br>  But this seemed to me a little.  Therefore, when I was offered a job in one widely known company in narrow circles, I did not refuse.  The first days at the new job seemed to me just fabulous.  The new colleagues accepted me very warmly, and I immediately felt like my own.  At work, I really liked the atmosphere, when local professionals can ask any question without unnecessary pripon.  Thanks to the then leadership for this.  It's damn nice to feel part of a team. <br><br>  Gradually, I began to turn increasingly often to the help of a very respected business analyst at work (but did not blame my work).  And he always willingly told me.  So gradually he became my mentor and I owe a lot to him.  As a result, in his working time, the management specifically allocated a budget of hours for me.  I felt that I was developing.  But then, to be honest, I was often freaked out when my documents were ‚Äúwrapped up‚Äù by the mentor 10 times.  But I had to go through this. <br><br>  At the same time, I did not give up studying at the institute and quite successfully continued it.  I got carried away with one subject, so I read books on it myself, and I made my coursework accordingly - ‚Äúin my own way‚Äù.  I believe that the basic knowledge of this subject helps me a lot.  Soon he graduated from college and said thanks to him. <br><br>  For successful development, that in the university, that independently, at first it is important to find a mentor.  You can not stew in its own juice.  Yes, mentors can harshly criticize and be boring, but this only hardens.  Self-education at home in front of books is nonsense.  We must try and communicate with our colleagues as much as possible.  This applies to any kind of education.  This is the only way to learn. <br><br>  I didn‚Äôt bring this story to show how well done and how well I did everything.  I am sure there are many guys who have a similar story.  My education can not be called ideal, but I tried to squeeze out of the available opportunities as much as I could.  So why not maximize all the learning opportunities ?!  Everyone chooses what he wants. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/20012/">https://habr.com/ru/post/20012/</a></p>
