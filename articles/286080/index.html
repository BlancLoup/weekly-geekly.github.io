It is necessary to submit an application for training in the selected university until a certain date, it has its own for each grant, and provide a package of documents. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f68/721/9d7/f687219d73894a8dbfe6f9d62964d4fc.png" alt="image"><br><br>  For admission to the magistracy in foreign universities, students need the following: <br><br>  1. Certificate <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/search.php%3Ftags%3DIELTS">IELTS</a> or <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/search.php%3Ftags%3DTOEFL">TOEFL</a> (to confirm the level of proficiency in English); <br><br>  2.

Confirmation or preliminary confirmation of enrollment in the selected university. <br><br>  Depending on the program, the list of requirements may vary slightly, for example, a resume of a supervisor or a research plan may be required. <br><br>  In most cases, documents are sent online.

All data are considered by the commission, and then either a refusal or an offer to come for further processing comes. <br><br>  To get a grant for training, you do not have to be the most talented or the smartest.  However, you must be distinguished by your academic and / or professional accomplishments.  If you have experience of participation in scientific or industry conferences, publications in periodicals, this will be a big plus to the summary.  It is desirable to have a profile experience.  Ideally, your teachers and supervisors at work will be able to give you excellent recommendations. <br><br>  If you have always dreamed of studying abroad, you know what specialty you like and want to develop further - Master's degree in foreign universities is the ideal solution.
