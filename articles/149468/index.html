      Many bugs fixed, many improvements and optimizations made. <br><br><br clear="all"><a name="habracut"></a>  The most basic innovation in this version is that you can respond from the extension, as well as perform any actions.  It turned out to be done through the iframe.  In Chrome, this works inside the extension, but in Opera, due to limitations in its architecture (content-scripts are not embedded in the pages created inside the extension), this technique does not work, so for Opera it is implemented through any open tab in the browser.  This is a prerequisite for answers in Opera, but since sites are usually viewed in the browser, this condition will almost always be fulfilled 100%.  From the Opera they promised that they would finalize this moment by the fall of this year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2c8/c3f/7c9/2c8c3f7c9626ff1b7bb5dc8a4e7ec87a.png"><br clear="all"><br>  Now in the extension you can see the tracker, as well as work with it.  Currently there are only two tabs in it - Posts and QA. <br><br>  Posts - this is still what is at the very Habr√©, a copy.  The advantages are that you can mark as read and delete all topics at once, and not page by page, as it is implemented in the Habr√©. <br><br>  But QA is a specific functionality of the extension, it allows you to monitor any question - all the clarifications, answers and comments will appear in the form of events, and the number of these new events in the form of green numbers with a plus is drawn in the tracker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6f6/b9c/6ed/6f6b9c6ed3d79b619eea6e9cc4434934.png"><br clear="all"><br>  If the tracker hovers the mouse over the links ‚Äúcomments‚Äù, ‚Äúclarifications‚Äù or counters of answers, then you can see all the correspondence in the question, and in each case, depending on what link the mouse hovers, unnecessary comments will be hidden and See, you need to click on the oval with the counter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/153/f64/fe5/153f64fe57b779a2685fd641bdc85029.png"><br clear="all"><br>  This is convenient in that only new elements will be visible, and those that have already been read will be hidden.  However, new comments are always marked with a darker background. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/670/27e/dac/67027edacc519bfa174751f977757b59.png"><br clear="all"><br>  From the tracker, you can mark as read all the events of this issue with one click - you need to click on the red ‚Äúnew‚Äù icon.  You can also stop following the question, and if you select the "delete all events" checkbox when unsubscribing, all events will also be deleted. <br><br>  If you have written a comment for any answer in the question, but have not been signed to the question, the extension will still notify you of subsequent comments in this answer (unless of course you manage to capture your comment on the air). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3d2/5e3/d5e/3d25e3d5ee250eedbb8dbd9683798a1b.png" align="right" hspace="10">  To subscribe (or unsubscribe) to a question, the extension inserts a checkout ‚Äúfollow through extension‚Äù to the page to the right of the panel.  This daw is both in the question itself and in any lists where there is a QA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/188/fca/6f5/188fca6f55f0a5d0367cd0f7f17a0fee.png"><br clear="all"><br>  The list of your comments and clarifications is located in a separate tab (there is no this list on Habr√©).  The extension carefully collects and stores all your comments and clarifications that it finds.  In the future, I will implement an instant reliable collection of this and any other added information - in Chrome there is an opportunity to intercept http-requests. <br><br>  Your questions, answers, as well as comments or clarifications written later than yours will also receive events - all answers, clarifications and comments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0bf/4f6/ea0/0bf4f6ea05b37bc013a9b86a1f38155f.png"><br clear="all"><br>  When trying to answer QA, you can choose three options for what to do specifically - clarify the question, answer the question or comment on the answer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/08e/fed/98c/08efed98caf427d4edf195be2537aa5c.png"><br clear="all"><br>  You can create a new correspondence with the user by clicking on the icon of the folder with a plus sign in the tab ‚Äúprivate correspondence‚Äù.  You must enter a folder name and text. <br><br>  Settings spread by tabs and types. <br>  Added settings: <br><ol><li>  <b>Restriction of loading and checking tracker, pages</b> .  Load only this number of tracker pages for analysis. </li><li>  <b>Frequency of rescan tracker, sec</b> .  How often will the entire list of your tracker be rescanned (all pages, not just the first one). </li><li>  <b>Tracker check frequency, sec</b> .  How often to check for new events in the tracker. </li><li>  <b>Scan frequency QA, sec</b> .  How often to check the live QA live on the appearance of updated QA, where you answered or commented.  It is advisable to set not very rarely, because your comments may be skipped. </li><li>  <b>Upload your old QA</b> .  If enabled, your old QA-questions will be loaded (for which the creation time is ahead of the extension installation time). </li><li>  <b>Limit the download and check your QA-questions pages</b> .  Load only this number of pages of your QA questions for analysis. </li><li>  <b>Frequency of rescanning of own QA-questions, sec</b> .  How often will the whole list of your QA-questions be rescanned for new answers in them?  It was done in order to still find comments for you, if they missed through checking the live broadcast - due to the closure of the browser, the lack of the Internet, etc. </li><li>  <b>Limit upload and check your QA-answers pages</b> .  Load only this number of pages of your QA responses for analysis. </li><li>  <b>Frequency of rescanning of own QA-responses, sec</b> .  How often will the entire list of your QA responses be rescanned for new comments?  It was done in order to still find comments for you, if they missed through checking the live broadcast - due to the closure of the browser, the lack of the Internet, etc. </li></ol><br><br>  For now.  Update through the standard browser feature or re-install the extension.  Then, if you need old information and you have unlimited fast traffic, you need to set the page limit everywhere in the settings everywhere and turn on all the checkboxes. <br><br>  In the near future I will be engaged in the section ‚ÄúEvents‚Äù, I will improve the tracker for posts (for example, I will also do as QA so that I can receive all new comments in the form of events), I will vote for comments and topics.  And I implement many other ideas in this extension. <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gcpdnedbfhbjeoeaahjfodohhdaonmpl">Chrome Extension</a> </li><li>  <a href="">Expansion for Opera ([oex])</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149468/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149468/</a></p>
