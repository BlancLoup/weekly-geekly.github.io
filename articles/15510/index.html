  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Marketing in the new "online-spoken world." Those companies that do not enter this world will simply disappear.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The current state of the Internet is characterized by an increase in ‚Äú <strong>powerful global conversation</strong> . <strong>‚Äù</strong>  Through the Internet, people learn and invent new ways to share relevant knowledge at blinding speed.  As a result, markets (where buyers choose and acquire) become ‚Äúsmarter and smarter.‚Äù  Before the marketers of the new time, a new <strong>challenge is set: to use this power faster and stronger than other companies.</strong> <br>  Markets are becoming very involved in this conversation.  The participants in this dialogue communicate in a special, but understandable language, a natural, open, honest, direct and even funny language, sometimes even shocking.  Whether it is an explanation or a complaint, a joke or a serious review - they cannot be fake in it.  Thus, the concept of <strong>‚Äúcolloquial marketing‚Äù</strong> emerged in the business sphere - marketing designed to help promote goods and services through the aforementioned global dialogue. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Its appearance is considered to be with the appearance in 1999 of <a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/">‚Äú <strong>The Cluetrain Manifesto‚Äù</strong></a> - a <strong>manifesto containing 95 theses, a kind of call to action for companies.</strong>  The ideas in the manifesto are aimed at studying the influence of the Internet on market relations of sellers and buyers, on the special formation of demand for goods and services in the Internet environment, the search for stable communication relationships both within consumer communities and in general between all market actors.  In other words, the manifesto‚Äôs ideas ‚Äúopen the eyes‚Äù to companies on the changes that are currently taking place in the markets.  They will be of interest to Internet marketers, top managers of companies, and <a href="http://slovari.yandex.ru/dict/glossary/article/252/252_116.HTM%3Ftext%3D%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D1%2585%2520%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9">researchers of marketing communications</a> . <br>  <strong>So, theses:</strong> <br><ol><li>  Markets are talk. </li><li>  Markets are made up of living people, and not from demographic sectors. </li><li>  People talk to each other not in machine voices, but in human voices, and their conversations sound like human beings. </li><li>  A human voice - voicing information, opinion, suggestion, objection, humorous comments - is usually natural, open, there is no falsehood. </li><li>  People tend to recognize each other by voice. </li><li>  The Internet provides people with new opportunities for conducting conversations that were simply inaccessible in the era of traditional media. </li><li>  Hyperlinks are detrimental to hierarchies. </li><li>  In markets that bind the Internet together, and in structures connected by networks, people talk with each other using powerful new tools. </li><li>  These network conversations give life to unprecedented forms of social organization and knowledge. </li><li>  The consequence of this is a qualitative improvement in the markets, their fuller awareness, higher organization.  Participation in the network market is fundamentally changing people. </li><li>  People in network markets understand that <strong>they receive the best information and support from each other</strong> , not from suppliers.  They do not perceive corporate rhetoric about ‚Äúcontinuous improvement in the quality of the product being produced‚Äù. </li><li>  <strong>There are no secrets left.</strong>  The network market knows about the product more than the manufacturing company knows about it.  News spreads instantly: both bad and good. </li><li>  Everything that happens in the markets is also true for employees.  The metaphysical construction, called the "Company", is the only barrier between the first and second. </li><li>  <strong>Corporate voices are not like voices heard in online conversations.</strong>  When corporations turn to the online community, they sound dry, boring, artificial. </li><li>  In a few years, the current homogeneous pseudo- <strong>voice of</strong> business - the <strong>‚Äúvoices‚Äù of business plans and advertising brochures</strong> - seem ridiculous and artificial, like the language of a French courtyard of the 18th century. </li><li>  Already, companies that speak the language of fair fielding are <strong>turning into emptiness</strong> . </li><li>  If companies imagine that <strong>online markets are no different from the markets</strong> for which they twist television advertising - they amuse themselves with illusions. </li><li>  Not realizing that their markets now turned into a close network of netizens, sharpening their experience, increasingly engaging in active communication, companies miss their best chance. </li><li>  Now companies can turn to their markets directly.  If they miss this opportunity, they will not have a second chance. </li><li>  Companies should take note of the fact that their <strong>markets often laugh</strong> .  They laugh at companies. </li><li>  Let the companies stop puffing up their cheeks and begin to <strong>take themselves a little less seriously</strong> .  They should have a sense of humor. </li><li>  Sense of humor - this is not the publication of jokes on the corporate website.  The sense of humor is rather composed of genuine life values, a bit of modesty, the ability to speak bluntly and the ability to see things from the right angle. </li><li>  Companies with claims to "positioning" for a start would be good to decide on the position.  Ideally, their position should be related to what the market itself is showing genuine interest in. </li><li>  Big boasting - <strong>‚ÄúWe aim to become the coolest supplier of the ABCGD!‚Äù</strong> - is not a position. </li><li>  Companies will have to leave their ivory towers.  <strong>They will have to speak directly with people with whom they want to establish relationships.</strong> </li><li>  <strong>‚ÄúPublic Relations‚Äù</strong> has nothing to do with the public.  Companies are usually afraid of their own markets. </li><li>  <strong>When they say ‚Äî detached, arrogant, and unfriendly</strong> ‚Äî they build a wall that separates them from the markets. </li><li>  Most <strong>marketing programs are dictated by fear</strong> , no matter how the market knows the truth about what is happening behind the scenes of the company. </li><li>  This was best expressed by Elvis: ‚ÄúIf there is suspicion, then you cannot go together!‚Äù </li><li>  <strong>‚ÄúBrand loyalty‚Äù</strong> , that is, consumer preferences for goods with a certain name ‚Äî this is the corporate way to keep afloat;  but collapse is inevitable - and it is getting closer.  <strong>The network unites conscious markets, giving them the freedom to revise their ideas with unimaginable speed.</strong> </li><li>  Network markets can change suppliers in the blink of an eye.  Network workers can change employers during the lunch break.  And your notorious staff reductions are to blame for this, it was they who taught us to ask: ‚ÄúBrand loyalty?  And what is it?" </li><li>  Conscious markets are able to find suppliers with whom they can speak the same language. </li><li>  <strong>The ability to speak like a human being will not be taught at seminars.</strong>  <strong>This skill is not acquired at closed conferences.</strong> </li><li>  To speak like people, companies need <strong>to share the concerns of the communities</strong> they are targeting. </li><li>  But the main condition is that they should belong to these communities. </li><li>  Companies need to ask themselves where <strong>their corporate culture ends</strong> . </li><li>  If it ends long before the community begins, such a company will not have a market. </li><li>  Human communities <strong>are based on discourse - human talk about human problems</strong> . </li><li>  <strong>The community of discourse</strong> is the market. </li><li>  <strong>Companies that are not part of the discourse community are destined to die.</strong> </li><li>  Companies put secrecy into a cult, and yet almost all of their secrets are <strong>open secret</strong> .  <strong>Most companies protect secrets not from competitors, but from their own market and their own employees.</strong> </li><li>  Not only in the network markets, but also in the companies themselves, <strong>people speak to each other directly</strong> - and not always about the rules and regulations, directives and reports. </li><li>  Such conversations are now conducted in intracorporate networks.  But only where there are good conditions for this. </li><li>  Usually, companies are introducing a local network in order to lower down the documents on company policy and other corporate instructions <strong>that ordinary workers are struggling to ignore</strong> . </li><li>  All local networks have a tendency to degenerate into death boredom.  The best of such networks are built ‚Äúby contradiction‚Äù, from the bottom up - for joint corporate discussion of problems.  Their existence is bearing fruit. </li><li>  A healthy intranet organizes workers - in every sense.  The effect of its functioning is much more weighty, coarse and visible than the programmatic requirements of any trade union. </li><li>  Such a situation scares blinkered companies, and yet their existence is directly dependent on how open their local network is, because it is precisely because of it that an unpleasant view of things arises and is transmitted.  They should overcome the constant temptation to "improve" or regulate the freedom of on-net communication. </li><li>  If in corporate internal networks there are no restrictions set by intimidation and literalism, communication in them vividly resembles free conversations of the network market. </li><li>  The charts and graphs of the old economy, whose plans were fully understood only by top management, ‚Äúdescended‚Äù down to the rank and file employees, only along hierarchical steps. </li><li>  Today, between these schemes and graphs, hypertext links are established instead of the old hierarchical ones.  <strong>Respect for really applicable knowledge takes precedence over respect for abstract authorities.</strong> </li><li> The command and administrative style of doing business is generated and fostered by ordinary bureaucracy, separation of powers, and an all-pervasive culture of paranoia. </li><li>  Paranoia is deadly to talk.  This is its essence.  But the <strong>lack of lively conversation is deadly for companies</strong> . </li><li>  There are only two conversations that are ongoing now and will always be conducted.  <strong>The first</strong> goes inside the company.  <strong>The second</strong> is on the market. </li><li>  As a rule, none of these conversations go smoothly.  However, in almost all cases, tracing the causes of failure will lead to unviable principles of command and control. </li><li>  Policies based on these principles are pernicious.  As tools, they do not hold water.  In an environment of workers who are united by a local network, command and administrative manners will be met with hostility and distrust. </li><li>  Two conversations tend to touch and cross.  They are conducted in the same language.  The same voices are heard in them. </li><li>  <strong>Smart companies will not stand aside, contemplating this process</strong> , but on the contrary, will push the changes, as long as they are irreversible. </li><li>  If we translate "the ability not to stand in the way of change" in the scores of the coefficient of mental abilities, then <strong>companies that have received the highest rating can be counted on their fingers.</strong> </li><li>  Millions of people online perceive companies (albeit unconsciously for the time being) as unnatural, speculative legal growths and fictions. </li><li>  Such a position is pure suicide.  Markets want to talk to companies. </li><li>  Sad as it may seem, the component of the company with which the market of network communities wants to speak is almost always hidden behind the smoke screen of aggressively annoying advertisements and behind fake words. </li><li>  Markets are reluctant to talk to ‚Äúvparivaniyu‚Äù and ‚Äúforaging‚Äù agents.  They want to break through the corporate firewall and directly <strong>engage in the internal conversation of the companies</strong> . </li><li>  Let's drop the masks, let's get personal: we are the markets.  We wish to speak with you. </li><li>  We want access to <strong>corporate information</strong> , to your plans and your strategy, to <strong>your best thoughts and selected knowledge</strong> .  We are not satisfied with full-color brochures and caressing eyes, pointless corporate websites. </li><li>  We are also the employees that make your companies exist.  We want to speak with the consumer directly, our real voice, and not cliches from someone else's script. </li><li>  Both the markets and the workers are all fed up with getting dosed information.  <strong>Is it worth using colorless annual reports for the first acquaintance with each other and not the first freshness of market research?</strong> </li><li>  And the markets and workers are all at a loss: why don't you listen to us?  Do you speak that language yourself? </li><li>  Pompous narcissistic jargon with which you treat the press and conference participants <strong>-</strong> how does it relate to us? </li><li>  Perhaps you are making the right impression on your investors.  But not on us. </li><li>  And if you do not impress us, then investors can relax.  Is it still incomprehensible to them?  Otherwise they would have shut up your fountain long ago. </li><li>  Your erased ideas about the "market" will overwhelm you.  We are not able to recognize ourselves in your projections.  Is it because we are already everywhere? </li><li>  We like the new market space.  After all, we ourselves create it. </li><li>  We invite you to yourself, but remember, this world is ours.  <strong>If you want to enter, take off your shoes at the doorstep.</strong>  If you have something to offer, kindly get off your camel! </li><li>  <strong>We are immune to advertising.</strong>  <strong>Forget about her.</strong> </li><li>  <strong>Want to talk to us - well, tell us something.</strong>  Try to interest us for a change. </li><li>  And we already have a couple of ideas for you: we need other tools, a newer, and we are not satisfied with the service: we need something for which we agree to pay.  Do you have a moment to discuss? </li><li>  Are you too busy ‚Äúworking like a bee‚Äù to reply to our email?  If so, sorry guys.  We may come back later.  May be. </li><li>  Do you want us to pay?  And we want you to listen to us! </li><li>  We want you to return from your illusory world, abandon monomania, worthy only of a neurasthenic, join our cheerful society. </li><li>  Do not worry, you can still make money.  <strong>On one condition: you should not think about money and only about money.</strong> </li><li>  Have you noticed that money itself is very one-sided and boring?  Perhaps we will look for some more topic? </li><li>  <strong>No one needs your product.</strong>  <strong>Why?</strong>  We would like to ask specifically who was engaged in it.  Your corporate strategy does not mumble, not calve.  We would have a word with your CEO.  What does it mean: "He is not in the place"? </li><li>  We want you to take us - millions of people - at least as seriously as you perceive advertising reporters from fashion glossy magazines. </li><li>  We know some employees of your company firsthand.  In network communication, they produce a decent impression.  <strong>Do you have other people where you hide them?</strong>  <strong>Why don't they appear, join the game?</strong> </li><li>  When we have questions, we turn to each other for answers.  <strong>We could ask your people - if you would not keep your staff in such fists.</strong> </li><li>  Many of us can join you <strong>- provided that we do not fall into your ‚Äútarget consumer groups‚Äù</strong> .  We want to talk online with friends, not count minutes.  Thanks to this medium, your name will be fixed much better <strong>than thanks to a website worth a million dollars</strong> .  <strong>And you say that appeal to the market is the task of marketers.</strong> </li><li>  Yes, we would like you to understand for yourself what is happening here.  That would be just great.  But do not imagine that we are holding our breath when you appear. </li><li>  <strong>We have a better lesson than to be tormented by doubts:</strong> they say, how have you been with time and have we not prevented your business?  For us, business is nothing more than a part of life.  For you, it seems, he is life.  Think about this: who needs it? </li><li>  <strong>In our hands, real power, and we are aware of this.</strong>  <strong>If you have vision problems, then the other team will succeed, those who have more correctness, who are pleasant to deal with.</strong> </li><li>  Even in its unfortunate manifestations, <strong>our new conversations are much more interesting than trade shows, more entertaining than TV humor, and certainly more truthful by several orders of magnitude than corporate sites that we have displeasure to contemplate</strong> . </li><li>  We are devoted to our friends, new allies and acquaintances ‚Äî in other words, to ourselves.  <strong>Those companies that do not enter this world will simply disappear.</strong> </li><li>  Companies spend millions on solving the problems of ‚Äúbrand positioning‚Äù, ‚Äúcapturing the target audience‚Äù, and ‚Äúeffectiveness of advertising budgets‚Äù.  Why the market does not hear how another bomb is ticking?  The stakes are much higher. </li><li>  We are inside and outside companies.  The boundaries separating our conversations are seen today as firm as the Berlin Wall, but in reality they are a minor hindrance.  We know that time boundaries are numbered.  <strong>And the work on the destruction of the walls is on both sides.</strong> </li><li>  Perhaps for people with a traditional corporate mentality, network conversations seem to be a jumble and confusing.  But we organize faster than they do.  Our tools are better, we have more new ideas and there are no restrictions that can hold us back. </li><li>  We wake up and make connections with each other.  We are seeing and seeing.  But we do not want to wait. </li></ol><br><br>  <strong>If you carefully read all the theses, you may say that there is nothing new in them.</strong>  But as they say - ‚Äúthe new is well forgotten old‚Äù.  Many of them make you think, and many may be the source of new marketing ideas and methods.  And some simply ‚Äúopen their eyes‚Äù to the important problems of companies. <br>  Research shows that advertising costs for social media and ‚Äúconversational marketing‚Äù (‚Äúconversational marketing‚Äù) by the end of 2012 will exceed traditional marketing expenses. <br>  Despite the new trends in the network mainstream, most modern companies continue to create <strong>monotonous offers of goods and services, traditional marketing booklets and brochures with familiar appeals</strong> , which are simply ‚Äústraining‚Äù people.  The same tone, the same lie. <br>  Therefore, <strong>proficiency in the language of a new global dialogue</strong> can already be interpreted not as some kind of ‚Äútrick‚Äù, but as a <strong>serious business process</strong> that allows you to ‚Äúlisten‚Äù to customers in a new way, but the <strong>ability to spread information about your products and services on the Internet in this dialect - as an effective marketing tool</strong> , the main rule of which is: people listen more and better - when you just talk to them in the "spoken" language, and of course, know how to listen and understand them. <br>  However, ‚Äúlearning‚Äù conversational marketing is not easy.  It will require a lot of time, effort, resources.  <strong>It is also difficult to measure, due to the lack of methods.</strong> <br>  <strong>But its benefits are obvious:</strong> <br><ol><li>  Your product (service) will be better focused on the consumer. </li><li>  Your company will not be perceived as just another corporation that only cares about profits. </li><li>  Improved brand positioning </li><li>  Good opportunity for fast and mass customer feedback </li><li>  And the most important (with effective and non-aggressive use) is the growth of their trust. </li></ol><br>  In preparing the article used translation from English.
