  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Change one word in the CTA-button and increase the conversion: myth or reality?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This question is asked by many.  Some argue that this is a myth, others - on the contrary.  In this article, on the basis of successful cases, you will learn in which cases A / B tests with very small changes in CTA-buttons can be very effective. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/244/2ad/07a/2442ad07ad264b29869050775eb2e7f2.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie-what-is-it/">A / B testing</a> is not an easy tool to increase conversion.  And for beginners it can be very difficult to create a good, thoughtful and reasonable experiment.  But you want to run a small A / B test, increase your conversion and put an extra $ 1,000 in your pocket in a week.  And in this case, testing of all elements in a row begins.  Of course, this is a mistake.

      It is logical that radical changes can greatly affect the conversion rate.  However, there is no absolutely direct connection between big changes and big successes.  Moreover, very minor changes can be very effective.  But only under one condition - the changes should relate to those elements that have the greatest impact on the conversion. <br><br>  For clarity, we consider 4 cases <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  1 case: change of one word on the call-to-action button - increase in clickability by 90% </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb6/1d0/88e/fb61d088e202460cbd32bc9da6ec765c.jpg"><br><br>  Michael Aagaard (an expert in the field of conversion optimization and copywriting) conducted this experiment on the Unbounce landing page.  As you can see in the picture, just one word was changed. <br><br>  The initial call-to-action text was ‚ÄúStart Your 30-Day Free Period.‚Äù  In the test version, only one word was changed - ‚ÄúStart my 30-day free period‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>As a result of this experiment, the CTA-button clickability has increased by 90%.</b> <br><br>  Thus, the change of only one pronoun in the call to action increased the number of transitions to the next stage of the sales funnel by 90%.  This is an excellent result for such a simple experiment that even a newcomer to A / B testing can run. <br><br>  Let's go further. <br><br><h4>  Case 2: adding a single word to the CTA-button - an increase in payments of 31.47% </h4><br>  This experiment was conducted at the final stage of the sales funnel - the payment page.  The Writework.com project is a paid educational portal for college and university students. <br><br>  <b>During the customer analysis, it was revealed that most of them are registered on the site when they urgently need material for student work</b> .  Thus, at this moment they try to find the necessary information as quickly as possible. <br><br>  <b>Therefore, it was hypothesized that the CTA-button with the text ‚ÄúCreate an account and start‚Äù will encourage students to register on the site</b> .  In fact, adding one word ‚ÄúStart‚Äù tells a potential client that all that is left for him to do is click on this button, and he can immediately begin his work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0fb/9ea/2e3/0fb9ea2e3b6f4015962c93d4fbc5ad1c.jpg"><br><br>  As seen in the picture, the initial version of the CTA button was ‚ÄúCreate an account‚Äù.  As a result of this experiment, the number of payments increased by 31.47%. <br><br>  Just one word added led to such a significant increase in conversion. <br><br>  Further 2 more convincing examples. <br><br><h4>  Case 3: CTA-button color change - 35.81% sales increase </h4><br>  This A / B test was conducted on the product pages of an online store that sells porcelain. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f76/064/f94/f76064f9442743459c33b0b388c054cd.jpg"><br><br>  As can be seen in the picture, initially the CTA-button ‚ÄúAdd to cart‚Äù was blue, while both the text and the background had similar colors.  What do you think was the problem? <br><br>  <b>It is absolutely logical that such a call to action button does not stand out at all against the background of other page elements.</b>  <b>Accordingly, it does not attract the attention of a potential client.</b> <br><br>  In the test version, the color was replaced by green.  Thanks to this minor change, online store sales increased by 35.81%. <br><br>  Now imagine what the increase in sales of a large online store by 35.81% means.  These are sums with five, six or seven zeros! <br><br>  One very simple conclusion follows from this case, about which we have already spoken a lot in the article <a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie/kakoy-tsvet-luchshe-vliyaet-na-konversiyu/">‚ÄúWhich color better affects the conversion rate</a> . <a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie/kakoy-tsvet-luchshe-vliyaet-na-konversiyu/">‚Äù</a>  All important elements, especially the call-to-action buttons, should clearly stand out against the rest of the site‚Äôs components.  They must attract attention and always be visible. <br><br><h4>  4 Case: Adding 3 words to the CTA-button - increase in clickability by 213.16% </h4><br>  This A / B experiment was conducted on the landing page of the company Fitness World - the largest network of gyms in Scandinavia.  The goal was set - an increase in the number of transitions to the payment page, where a potential client is invited to choose a gym and pay a subscription. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/29d/885/954/29d8859543754e27897b2970ee5baf97.jpg"><br><br>  The original version of the CTA-button had the text "Purchase a subscription."  In the test version, 3 words were added - ‚ÄúChoose a gym and pay a subscription.‚Äù  As a result of this experiment, the number of transitions to the next stage of the sales funnel increased by 213.16%. <br><br>  In this example, interesting is the fact that initially the call to action was quite literate.  <b>But, in the course of research of the target audience, it turned out that one of the most important factors in purchasing a subscription is the location of the gym.</b>  <b>That is why it was decided to make the call to action more specific and relevant to the needs of the target audience.</b> <br><br>  So, we looked at 4 excellent A / B testing cases, in which very minor changes were a great success.  What conclusion can be drawn from all this? <br><br>  Conclusion <br><br>  <b>Small changes matter.</b>  <b>Yes it is.</b>  <b>This is proven in practice.</b>  <b>But this does not mean that they always lead to an increase in conversion.</b>  <b>And this is a fact.</b> <br><br>  <b>Small changes in A / B tests only work if they concern critical elements.</b>  In our case, these were CTA-buttons - they are the most common object of A / B experiments. <br><br>  Why? <br><br>  The sales funnel always consists of several stages.  And the transition from one stage to another is almost always carried out by pressing the CTA-button.  Accordingly, the CTA-button has a direct impact on the decisions and actions of potential customers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b0/e9d/b36/3b0e9db36fa84f94902669c5dc722ca8.jpg"><br><br>  If you have an online store, then first the visitor enters your website by clicking on the advertisement, then adds the product to the basket, pressing the CTA-button, then proceeds to the payment process, to fill in the delivery information, etc.  And every time he has to interact with the call-to-action button.  And at each stage of the sales funnel, CTA buttons are microconversions, which ultimately lead to macroconversion (the main target action).  In the online store - it is payment for the goods. <br><br>  <b>In addition to the call-to-action buttons, small changes to filling out forms, headers, and USP (Unique Sales Offer) can also be effective.</b> <br><br>  Prepared by the blog <a href="http://boosta.ru/">Boosta.ru</a> and the project <a href="http://www.changeagain.me/ru/">Changeagain.me</a> <br><br>  <b>Read also our other popular articles:</b> <br><br>  1. <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/changeagain/blog/19126/">They will help you find all the ‚Äúkillers‚Äù of the conversion - 10 reports in Google Analytics</a> (5000+ views) <br>  2. <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/changeagain/blog/19542/">100 ideas for A / B testing.</a>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/changeagain/blog/19542/">Part One</a> (2000+ views) <br>  3. <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/changeagain/blog/19548/">100 ideas for A / B testing: Part Two</a> (1000+ views) <br>  4. <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/changeagain/blog/19686/">How to find an idea for an A / B test: heat maps and polls</a> (1000+ views) <br><br>  Translation and adaptation: <a href="http://contentverve.com/10-call-to-action-case-studies-examples-from-button-tests/">http://contentverve.com/10-call-to-action-case-studies-examples-from-button-tests/</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295232/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295232/</a></p>
