  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A side view of the openness of Android and iOS</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/26b/b89/a26/26bb89a2694a468eb8cf9e9b4521c5cd.jpg"><br><br>  Mobile operating systems from Google and Apple exist quite a lot of time.  Each of them has its own characteristics, concept, ‚Äúparty policy‚Äù.  Sometimes they intersect, and sometimes they switch places.  So, for example, things are open.  Yes, oddly enough, but it is about the openness of the platform speech. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As you can see, in the past year and a half - two, with the release of the latest versions of the OS, companies are starting to change their policy in terms of openness.  Apple gradually opens its iOS for third-party developers, and Google, on the contrary, tightens its screws, after a long anarchy.  About what I am saying - Apple gives the opportunity to install third-party keyboards, despite the long rejection of such, introduces additional settings, certain software features, in terms of - finally completed, the so-called - notification shutter, in which you now not only see the information about that some application allowed to show, as well as you can respond to these notifications, see other information (quotes, weather, etc.), in the new version of the OS they gave access to TouchID, although they said that only Apple would have such an opportunity supposedly because of  and security for users.  With the departure of Steve Jobs, the company began to sag under the pressure of the market, both in a variety of models of devices and in technical terms.  Here you have new screen sizes, here you have additional keyboards, notification center, something that didn‚Äôt exist before, and which the company didn‚Äôt find acceptable.  This is neither good nor bad, just competition works wonders. <br><br>  At Google, everything goes a little different way, taking up a large share of devices with its operating system, and understands that this kind of anarchy, about which I mentioned earlier, cannot be created for a long time.  And an uncontrollable, solvent society cannot live so long.  Therefore, they began to introduce some restrictions, which, for some reason, many began to ignore, not highlighting the list of changes, when the next version of Android comes out.  For example, the function of transferring applications to the memory card was removed (there is a small disclaimer - it is possible to return it, but this is all done using root and rewriting the rights to the application).  There is a constant monitoring of running applications that were not installed from Google Play.  Removed the ability to connect in Mass storage mode, replacing it with a cropped MTP, which does not provide full access to the content, and all this is done for your own good (remember the similar care that Apple had?).  Removed the setting of individual permissions for each application (App Ops), which was introduced in version 4.3.  It was possible for any application to remove the rights you need - sending sms, make calls, read contacts and much more.  For now, it all looks like a deep burying of all those functions that were useful and easy for users.  Do not be surprised if in some version of Android, Google says that now you can only install applications from Google Play.

      It is possible in the future, Apple and Google will come to some one idea in continuing the development of their systems, but will do it in different ways.  Therefore, pay less attention to the statements of companies about openness, location to consumers, this is done for their own benefit and that in the future they will not lose control over the system and users and will be able to get information from you to improve their services. <br><br>  <a href="https://dzvyagin.ru/vzglyad-so-storony-na-android-i-ios/">A source</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/361767/">https://habr.com/ru/post/361767/</a></p>
