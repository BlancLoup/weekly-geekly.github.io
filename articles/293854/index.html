When people make a complaint, they are offended by the company, disappointed, and since they rarely see a representative of the brand in front of them, they say differently than if they spoke to a person, which may seem impolite.  But the representative of the brand must remember that the client is upset, and see in his words not the form, but the content. <br><br>  Customer complaints are the cheapest way to improve a product.

      Large companies spend huge budgets for marketing research, studying consumer complaints in their own and neighboring industries.  Small and medium businesses are better off using what they‚Äôre reporting themselves and encouraging this process. <br><br>  It is important to take into account the statistics of complaints.  Leaves claims only 1 of 27 clients.  Those.  per 100 voiced claims account for about 2,700 dissatisfied customers.  But the aim is to reduce the number of complaints should not be, most often it just leads to the concealment of information by employees. <br>  Complaints work for or against your company for the following reasons: <br>  ‚Ä¢ people are more likely to believe friendly recommendations than inviting promises of advertising agents; <br>  ‚Ä¢ effective resolution of a complaint can be a powerful source of positive feedback; <br>  ‚Ä¢ The more irritated a client is, the more willing it is to report negative experiences to others. <br><br>  As you yourself noticed, people more easily share negative experiences than positive ones.  This is due to the fact that it is right to save a stranger from trouble.  There is only one exception - a positive experience after the complaint.  The reason is explained by the principle of reciprocity: a person wants to make something pleasant for those who solved his problem. <br><br>  What do people who complain want <br>  Most often - to receive due by the right of apology.  And having received more from the company, they remain its customers and leave a new, positive review.  The customers whose problem they solved are even more loyal than those who had no difficulties at all. <br><br>  What can be offered as compensation: <br>  sincerely excuse; <br>  price reduction or free service, if possible; <br>  free product or gift; <br>  discount voucher upon next request; <br>  a guarantee that the company has taken measures to change the situation, and what happened will not happen again. <br><br>  People don't always need a refund.  Only 10% of diner visitors want discounts or free food if the ordered dish is not prepared satisfactorily.  They prefer to have another dish brought to them or ‚Äúbrought to readiness‚Äù of the existing one.  In this case, monetary compensation or the provision of a free coupon for the next visit does not make sense. <br><br>  Customers want different things depending on the situation.  Complaints are recommended to be divided into two categories: <br>  1) circumstances that can and should be corrected; <br>  2) a situation that cannot be corrected, but customers want to express their feelings and be heard. <br><br>  Why are there few complaints? <br>  Often the complaint does not promise great benefits.  So, if we are talking about inexpensive goods or services, people prefer to draw conclusions and not come back more than to ‚Äúmake a scandal‚Äù.  Often, the company and its employees discourage the client from expressing dissatisfaction: people do not know where to write or call, and the attendants are hostile. <br><br>  Often the client‚Äôs dependency situation becomes the decisive factor: parents are afraid to complain about the teacher, who can then ‚Äúrecoup‚Äù their child;  patients do not complain about the attending physician, because  depend on it;  hotel guests will not complain until the last day, when spoiling their vacation will be even more difficult. <br><br>  Complaints Strategy <br><br>  1. Say thanks and explain why.  Firstly, it will switch a dissatisfied customer to a more productive course, and secondly, it will show that you really appreciate his opinion. <br><br>  2. Apologize and promise to take action immediately.  An apology is no coincidence after gratitude.  Otherwise, it may be perceived incorrectly.  The promise to take action is the final stage of the psychological game with the client.  It shows that you are ready to spend money and time to restore confidence. <br><br>  3. Find out the necessary information.  Do not say: "I need certain information, otherwise I will not be able to help you."  On the contrary, you ask for help from customers.  Ask only the most necessary questions.  You need to know in advance what information you need.  Make sure to collect all the necessary information, otherwise you will have to contact the client again. <br><br>  4. Quickly correct the error so that the client feels that it is important to you. <br><br>  5. Make sure the customer is satisfied.  Call him later, make sure he has no more questions.  Tell us how, thanks to his complaint, you solved the problem of other clients.  Feel like a partner. <br><br>  6. Punish the process, not the people.  Inform employees about the value of complaints, make them willing to tell you about them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293854/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293854/</a></p>
