  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Notebook Digital Hi-Note Ultra 2000</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> I decided to tell about my 15-year-old laptop with a 14.1 ‚Äùscreen, whose native batteries still hold 4 hours without recharging.  A laptop, even 15 years old, but gives odds to modern solutions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Brief characteristics of the laptop itself: <br>  Digital Hi-Note Ultra 2000, model GTX5266M.  1997 <br>  Pentium-I 266MHz processor, L1 cache 32kb, L2 cache 1Mb <br>  144MB RAM So-DIMM EDO <br>  14.1 ‚Äùscreen 1024x768, 64k colors, active matrix. <br>  Video card: 4mb, mpeg4 support <br>  Winchester: worth 3.1GB.  People quietly put 40GB. <br>  32-bit PCMCIA! <br>  OS: Initially, laptops came with Windows 95 / NT.  I immediately installed Windows-98 for myself, people run Windows XP normally (on models with 233/266 MHz). <br>  What immediately catches the eye is that it does not look like the old one, and nothing in it reveals that it was made back in 1997.  It looks like a completely modern laptop - even today.  Looks very stylish.  The keys on the keyboard are thin and easily pressed, like on modern laptops.  What is particularly surprising is the battery.  I have never seen a Digital Hi-Note Ultra 2000 anywhere with dead batteries.  Even on ebay at _vseh_ selling notebooks of this model of the battery - live, despite of age. <br>  In 2005-2006, I actively carried this laptop at the lecture, worked up to 12 hours on it (3 sets of batteries for 4 hours each - enough for 12 hours of battery life).  But one day, he stopped charging 2 batteries - he charged a little and removed his charge.  Later I found out that it was in the battery controller - the banks themselves were like new.  The batteries were further disassembled and used to repair the battery of the tablet 486 laptop - they kept the nominal capacity perfectly.  The laptop was sent to retire and all this time has not been used.  Periodically, he and his batteries had to spend the winter in the cold.  And now - 2012.  The first battery, with a dead controller, was only able to charge a little (for a couple of minutes the charging lamp lights up, then goes off and the charging does not go) - so it was enough for 17 minutes of operation.  He took out the first battery, put the second one instead, put it on charge ... It took 3 hours to charge.  Further, in the BIOS settings, I selected High Performance (maximum performance mode, you can also choose the opposite mode - battery saving mode).  I banned the screen and the hard drive from shutting down, started counting the time ... I did everything so that the battery was discharged as soon as possible, but nevertheless the laptop worked from it ... almost put one to three.  Minutes did not have to passport four hours.  In the energy saving mode, he would have worked longer ... Of course, the batteries were able to do before - 15 years passed unnoticed for them. <br><br>  Here it is, handsome, in the closed position.  The case to the touch has a thin rubber coating (or plastic such?).  In the corners of the case, it is clear that the cover of the case has already been rubbed down to black plastic. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/679/8de/888/6798de888f7fc962e06a44c4478d5d2e.jpg"><br><br>  Thin keys that are easily pressed, like on modern laptops.  At the bottom of the main screen there is a symbolic screen that reflects the status of the work, the activity of the hard drive, the pressed caps, etc.  Below to the right of the screen is a microphone. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2b9/3a6/95d/2b93a695d8d12fd9442605943e21a3c0.jpg">

      The keyboard is a passive heat sink for the processor (the processor contacts the keyboard through a heat transfer pink rubber pad).  On the left we see an easily removable basket with a hard drive.  The metal part on the right is a floppy drive interchangeable with the cd-room. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e41/362/1d5/e413621d5abfa933b843fcd01c0b49f8.jpg"><br><br>  Right side of the notebook, from left to right: right speaker;  a golden panel hiding the built-in PCMCIA LAN / Modem card (the board connects the card ports to the ports on the back end of the laptop), floppy drive (interchangeable with cd-rom, instead of which you can fasten a modern dvd / cd-rw on the slide), audio ports microphone / headphone, green power button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b7f/2af/3a2/b7f2af3a2f6c3f4004eb53b20c6860fc.jpg"><br><br>  On the left side of the notebook are two PCMCIA ports covered with curtains. <br><br>  At the rear end of the notebook, from left to right: power connector, PS / 2 keyboard / mouse, 100 Mbps network / modem (connected to the integrated PCMCIA card), com-port, parallel port, VGA, infrared port. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fd2/012/1b9/fd20121b9268bb1173bd497d519227b6.jpg"><br><br>  Native laptop battery made by Sony.  14.4 volts, 4050 mAh, keeps to this day 4 hours (made in japan, however!) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/00c/10f/7ba/00c10f7ba190463cedf3996072bd0d8b.jpg"><br><br>  Laptop docking station  To the touch same pleasant, with a thin rubberized layer.  Dimensions in width and height correspond to the size of the laptop.  The thickness of the docking station is half the thickness of the laptop, i.e.  about 1cm.  On the top panel of the docking station we see two speakers. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6da/b93/cdb/6dab93cdb0e6be4f8a3aeff8b182894a.jpg"><br><br>  Left panel of the docking station, from left to right: midi / game-port, 2xPCMCIA, USB, audio line out, line in, <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/766/ddd/682/766ddd682a3d3acae3e073fa26b943f0.jpg"><br><br>  The right panel of the docking station, from left to right: S-Video, composite video output (PAL / NTSC / OFF switch on the rear panel), floppy / cd-rom port, laptop release button <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c3f/0fe/a29/c3f0fea29875889b6682c38d45bdf085.jpg"><br><br>  From the bottom of the docking station we see a low-frequency speaker (a total of 5 speakers: 2 in a laptop, 2 in a docking station, and 1 subwoofer from the bottom of the docking station), and ... Exactly the same connector for connecting to a docking station as on a laptop!  Those.  Docking stations can be piled onto each other in unlimited amounts, like Lego bricks.  :) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/357/092/603/3570926034647dec556544be8e239532.jpg"><br><br>  Laptop charging <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0e5/5c7/cfa/0e55c7cfaa04a83c9114abebbb550df5.jpg"><br><br>  Boot Windows-98.  With the OS loaded, the Fn + key combination can be displayed over the current image icon of the battery charge level, in the upper left corner. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f0b/530/237/f0b5302376427da34d9eee8fc01e6a46.jpg"><br><br>  Logged in BIOS <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b9a/d1f/729/b9ad1f72963baab9f2411bacc42ff6cf.jpg"><br><br>  The laptop left very pleasant memories.  Last year, but even nowadays it looks modern and stylish, and has retained 100% performance - even the battery of the year has not been affected ... <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139767/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139767/</a></p>
