      2) I spoke not so much about censorship, but about other things, in particular technical ones. <br>  Who wants to read - welcome. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><hr><br>  <b>Habr is out of politics</b> , but it seems that ‚Äúthe mountain has come to Mahomet‚Äù. <br><br>  If you let everything go, the freedom of speech <a href="http://www.constitution.ru/10003000/10003000-4.htm">guaranteed by the Constitution of Russia</a> , sooner or later will <i>really</i> be under threat. <br>  As far as I understand, it is already being violated, blocking information <i>not prohibited by law</i> , albeit by mistake. <br><br>  What is the problem, brothers IT-shniki?  We have a <a href="http://www.constitution.ru/10003000/10003000-3.htm">democracy</a> - the power of the people - do not forget about it. <br><br>  No programmers are sitting in the Duma - just complaining ‚Äúdo it well, but I don‚Äôt know how‚Äù the deputies and the President are meaningless, they will not find the answer. <br>  So, the people should help - you need to find a solution, and <b>IT specialists</b> can do it. <br><br>  <b>Where, if not on the largest IT site of the Runet, you can solve the problem so that there is no reason to complain?</b> <br>  So that, as a result, it was possible to offer a solution to the people to the leadership of the country. <br><br>  A little analysis of the situation. <br><br>  Even before the <a href="http://www.rg.ru/2010/12/31/deti-inform-dok.html">law</a> ‚ÄúOn protecting children from information harmful to their health and development‚Äù (adopted back in 2010) came into force, <i>by a court decision,</i> it was possible to block the materials prohibited for distribution on the territory of the Russian Federation. <br>  Materials recognized as extremist <i>(</i> <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BC"><i>extremism</i></a> <i>- adherence to extreme views and measures and unwillingness to make an agreement)</i> are officially and openly listed in the relevant <a href="http://www.minjust.ru/nko/fedspisok/">list of the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation</a> . <br><br>  On September 1 of this year, a law came into force prohibiting the dissemination among children of information that could harm "the health and (or) physical, mental, spiritual, moral development" of children, including pornography. <br><br>  Notice, <b>among children</b> - and here I agree: unlike adults, children first just learn what they see.  Analyzing events and deciding whether it is right or not to do something, we all begin <b>on the basis of previous experience</b> - what we have already managed to find out at some point. <br>  Almost completely, a person forms his consciousness only to a mature age. <br><br>  If the <i>child</i> saw that ‚Äúthe girl became sad and she jumped out of the window‚Äù or how the children poke out her eyes with a dart (a very real example from the Japanese ‚Äúcartoon‚Äù), this will be a pattern of behavior that he will remember. <br>  If the child is told that he lives in a terrible country where nothing good is impossible, he will count it that way. <br><br>  Of course, this will not be the only source of information, and the child will eventually receive a more or less correct upbringing. <br>  But the <b>information we receive in childhood is remembered most of all.</b> <br>  On this basis, we make further decisions. <br>  And I hope your children do not watch today's crime series. <br><br>  No matter how trite it sounds, but parents should be the first to look after children. <br>  It is with them that the child is the closest, and if they do not teach him good things, he will ‚Äúteach life‚Äù, but that's what the big question is. <br><br>  I support restricting <i>children's</i> access to content that can teach them <i>non-human</i> behavior. <br>  Notice, the psychiatrist <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/153953/">also does not object</a> to such a law. <br><br>  The age limit is not new and has long been used in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_picture_rating_system">most countries</a> , including Russia. <br>  It is used with regulated access to information - watching movies in the cinema, buying games, etc. <br><br>  On the Internet, if desired, any information is available completely uncontrollably for any age: the general availability of any information is its feature. <br><br>  We have now very clumsily tried to counteract this. <br>  That is, within Russia, remove certain information from open access that does not require special knowledge (using Tor, I2P, VPN, etc.). <br><br>  Those who want to find such information - they will find it in any case. <br>  On Habr√© people are literate, and no one in this, I hope, does not doubt. <br><br>  Restrictions attempted to enter precisely for the mass user, to whom the limited information is not constantly needed. <br><br><h1>  And then the question arises - <i>how was</i> it done? </h1><br>  <b>Short chronology of events.</b> <br>  On September 18, they tried to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/151759/">block the video on YouTube</a> - instead, the provider banned YouTube entirely, then another provider did <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/151924/">the same</a> , and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/151981/">then</a> simply ordered to block communication services <a href="http://interfax.ru/news.asp%3Fid%3D266515">‚Äúuser access to Internet resources‚Äù</a> , which <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/152004/">was</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/152735/">done</a> - entirely on YouTube. <br>  Also tried to block and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/151924/">VKontakte</a> - again, all. <br><br>  Everyone laughed and said "PR movie." <br>  But these were only the ‚Äúfirst swallows‚Äù of the fact that something would go wrong. <br>  There was <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/152451/">another</a> ‚Äúbell‚Äù: ‚Äúinfogr.am‚Äù, <a href="http://slon.ru/future/nastupila_osen_internet_tsenzury-829637.xhtml">located on the same IP</a> with another, officially blocked resource, was unfairly under the distribution. <br>  And <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/155819/">one more thing</a> : because of one article, they tried to ban access to the whole of Wikipedia. <br>  It was funny, yes. <br><br>  And, finally, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/157007/">on November 1 of</a> this year, the <a href="http://zapret-info.gov.ru/">Unified Register</a> was launched, which allows "to identify sites on the Internet that contain information whose distribution in the Russian Federation is prohibited." <br><br>  And here ‚Äúthunder struck‚Äù: in a row blocked several well-known sites of the Runet ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/158237/">1</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/158345/">2</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/158367/">3</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/158515/">4</a> ). <br>  And finally, epically <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/159179/">banned</a> Google. <br><br>  Of course, blocking information that is <i>not under a ban has</i> caused logical outrage. <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/158133/">We realized</a> that not all providers are able to cut out separate content and block the site entirely - almost immediately. <br>  Began to seriously ask <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/158375/">questions</a> . <br><br>  And now let's see what solutions we started to offer: <br>  - learn to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/151934/">bypass the "Great Russian firewall"</a> ; <br>  - once again <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/157547/">bypass the firewall</a> ; <br>  - quickly make a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/158393/">mirror of the site</a> , "saving" it from blocking; <br>  - partially <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/158559/">go to I2P</a> ; <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/152941/">register the</a> site as a media. <br><br>  <b>The problem now is that content is limited.</b> <br>  In the meantime, they decided how to provide access to the <strike>useless</strike> blocked. <br><br>  Meanwhile, the show continues, and events are developing quite quickly: they are shutting down <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/159059/">DC ++ networks</a> , while in the Duma, in the meantime, they <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/151938/">prohibit anonymizers</a> , ban children from accessing <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/153577/">public Wi-Fi</a> and ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/159151/">allow</a> ‚Äù providers to use DPI (which, in fact, no one forbade ), but ‚Äúin the absence of technical capability,‚Äù <b>still block by IP</b> . <br><br>  Once again, we are talking about the protection of <i>children</i> . <br>  By the way, we are one of the first to raise this issue in relation to the Internet. <br>  Do you really want porn and murder scenes to be freely available at every turn? <br><br>  The technical implementation is not even lame yet, and in half of the cases it is simply absent. <br>  If it is possible to find a solution, it must be found, and I propose to try to do it. <br>  Or say that it is impossible in principle. <br><br>  PS Take the situation seriously. <br><br>  UPD: For those who believe that freedom of speech is being oppressed in Russia, I clarify: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/159385/">habrahabr.ru/post/159385/#comment_5469813</a> <br><br><h3>  It is harmful to conceal the truth. <br>  And trying to remove the <i>lie</i> , presenting these things good. </h3><br>  Harassment of freedom of speech in blocking normal, useful content. <br>  Think again. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288592/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288592/</a></p>
