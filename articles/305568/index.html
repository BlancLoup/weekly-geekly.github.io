Internet providers all problems are tied to a specific consumer.  There is not so much support for the company's services (IPTV, Internet), but the solution of the tasks that the user creates for himself (broken wires, idle Skype, for some reason, quickly running out of money, etc.).  The only exceptions are problems caused by malfunctioning of switching equipment, communication lines and other things. <br><br>  At the moment I am working in the technical support service of the company ‚ÄúRTL-Service‚Äù, which is developing local positioning systems with voice communications.  The approach of our company is markedly different from other places where I had to work - since there are fewer customers than the provider, all support is built for the specific version of the product to which customers are initially attached. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  We use an automated system for processing applications based on Redmine.  Or rather, some plugins: <br>  Redmine helpdesk plugin - <a href="http://www.redmine.org/plugins/redmine_helpdesk">www.redmine.org/plugins/redmine_helpdesk</a> <br>  Document Management System Features - <a href="http://www.redmine.org/plugins/dmsf">www.redmine.org/plugins/dmsf</a> (Required for storing logs, software versions and other attachments.) <br>  Any e-mail address instantly creates a trouble ticket in this system, and then goes to the appropriate department for a solution.  Ticket status is updated and can be viewed by all support department staff.  Managers can monitor all actions that are performed / carried out in real time.

Virtual machine does not start on client hardware. <br>  - Good evening!  Describe your hardware configuration. <br>  - "Description of the configuration of iron" <br>  - You need to put down the option to support virtualization in the BIOS.  Can I help you with anything else? <br>  - Thank you, it all started.  If you have questions, I will contact you. <br>  - All the best, I was glad to help. </div></div><br><br>  But there are also requests related to the operation of the local positioning system.  And some of them are also solved at the level of the technical support department. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">For example</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> <br>  - Good day! <br>  Communication with the dispatcher does not work after the transfer of the arm to another city.  What can be wrong? <br>  C Regards, mr.  Black, N. <br><br>  - Mr.  Black, with high probability we can say that the problem is that the gateway access point (STD) "does not know" the address of the server. <br>  If the address pool 10.73.50.0/24 serves the dhcp server on the Catalyst 3650 on a new object, then you need to add an additional option 48 (X Window System Font Server Option), which is used by default to transfer the server‚Äôs IP address, to its configuration. SHDD <br>  The approximate Catalyst 3650 config should look like this: <br> <code>ip dhcp pool main <br> network 10.73.50.0 255.255.255.0 <br> default-router &lt;ip___&gt; <br> dns-server &lt;ip__dns&gt; <br> domain-name rtlservice.com <br> option 48 ip 10.101.32.21 <br></code> <br>  To apply the dhcp settings, you need to reset the DTC for power. <br>  If everything is open on Check Point, it should work. <br>  Yours sincerely, RTL Service </div></div><br><br>  If the question concerns the violation of the functionality of the positioning system itself, it is almost always necessary to request from the client data from the server, logs, screenshots of errors.  All information is transferred to the testing department. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">An example of a request that is sent to the testing service</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><br>  Good day! <br>  When editing (adding a map, a new point) and clicking the "save" button in the client, an error "RTLSCP server is unavailable" occurs.  Reloading the page does not help.  The client comes to life after reconfiguring the application server and refreshing the page. <br>  In the browser console message: <br>  <i>"2015/1/21 15: 7: 6.411 [error: js / rtls.web.ext / api / Rtls.API.RtlsCP.js: 979: 36] RTLSCP: ERROR: server localhost: 9003 / rtlscp / is unavailable logs2indexeddb .js: 221</i> <i><br></i>  <i>GET localhost: 9003 / rtlscp / version / get / Rtls.API.RtlsCP.js: 1013 "</i> <br>  Software version: <br><br>  <i>ii rtls-appserver-demo-2.15 2.15.8587 all RTLS application server</i> <i><br></i>  <i>ii rtls-incputils-2.15 2.15.8499 all Collection of INCP command line utilities</i> <i><br></i>  <i>ii rtls-server-2.15 2.15.8587 all RTLS services for DEMO installation</i> <br><br>  Time 15:04 -15: 05. <br>  Logs in LOG.zip. <br>  Video in the "video.mp4" file <br>  This happened in the DEBUG mode. <br>  video.mp4 (1,772 MB) <br>  LOG.zip (4.243 MB) </div></div><br>  The testing department reproduces an error on the required software version, sends it to the developers for revision / correction.  The Software Department sends the revised software version to the testing department.  Its employees reproduce the error, confirm that it does not occur and transfer to the support.  We, in turn, send the corrected version to the client.  And we are waiting for feedback from him. <br><br>  All calls and decisions on them should be saved to increase the speed of customer support.  Also, the necessary knowledge base for existing employees and the rapid training of new ones.  For all this, we use KnowledgeBase - a system built on the Wiki engine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/179/95c/86f/17995c86fe66b53143dd9a5f12cfe8d4.jpg" alt="image" width="800"><br><br>  Summarizing all the above, I‚Äôll note that you can build a good system for the technical support department based on Redmine, since  all plugins are free and their functionality is more than enough.  And, in general, support is always extremely important for any company, since it is not only the ‚Äúface‚Äù of the organization, but also the first front line in servicing and interacting with the client.  Take care of technical support, train and train employees. <br><br>  The author: Ilya Kuznetsov </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/305568/">https://habr.com/ru/post/305568/</a></p>
