However, this is not the limit - it is further expected to get even lower temperatures, even in comparison with those reached in terrestrial laboratories. <br><br>  At such temperatures, the atoms begin to behave differently than in any other known and observed by us substance.  BEC is called the ‚Äúfifth state of matter,‚Äù thereby separating it from solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma;  since condensate atoms behave more like waves than particles.  The wave nature of matter can only be observed in ultra-small scale phenomena, but BEC makes them more noticeable - and therefore it is easier to analyze them.  Ultracold atoms are in a state with minimal energy and take the same wave state, becoming indistinguishable from each other;  the atomic cloud begins to behave entirely as a kind of single "superat". <br><br><h3>  Difficult thing </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/at/0-/7e/at0-7ewgqboax8ikspbxt5ol_3c.jpeg"><br>  <i>CAL consists of two standardized units that will be installed onboard the ISS.</i>  <i>The big block is jokingly called the "four-chamber refrigerator", and the small one - the "single-chamber";</i>  <i>big and contains all the stuffing that produces ultracold atoms.</i>  <i>Source: NASA / JPL-Caltech / Tyler Winn</i> <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis is a damn complicated tool,‚Äù explains JPL Shotwell, chief engineer at the Department of Physics and Astronomy JPL, who oversaw all the work on the installation since February 2017. and we created a device no larger than a portable refrigerator and can control it from the Earth.  We had to break down a lot of barriers and make a lot of effort to ensure that this puzzling thing ended up on the space station today. ‚Äù <br><br>  The first Bose-Einstein condensate was obtained in 1995, although the phenomenon itself was predicted by physicists Shatiendranath Bose and Albert Einstein 71 years before.  In 2001, Eric Cornell, Karl Wiemann and Wolfgang Ketterle shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for creating and studying the characteristics of WEC in the laboratory;  In the following year, five research groups, including those led by Cornell and Ketterle, will conduct experiments with cold atoms.  Since the mid-nineties, scientists around the world have made hundreds of such experiments;  most of them are on Earth, but a few in short space flights - aboard geophysical rockets.  Finally, science received a way to carry out everyday experiments with condensate for a long period of time aboard the ISS. <br><br>  BEC is produced in non-material ‚Äúatomic traps‚Äù created by magnetic fields or lasers.  In the earth's field when the trap is turned off, ultracold atoms disperse almost immediately with attraction, so they can be observed only for a fraction of a second.  However, in microgravity conditions, a suspension exists from five to ten seconds;  the total for the day, scientists recruited up to six hours of observations. <br><br>  As soon as the pressure drops inside the trap, the temperature naturally decreases;  the longer the cloud of atoms remains in the trap, the colder it becomes.  Those who worked with a can of paint, this phenomenon is familiar - the can is cooled just because of the pressure drop.  In microgravity, the condensate pressure drops to ultra small values, reducing in turn the temperature to values ‚Äã‚Äãunattainable by earthly tools.  Day after day, the installation works without any intervention from the station crew. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wr/ro/-m/wrro-mak4wqsqesnp5wmu3z4yxk.jpeg"><br>  <i>It is here that the Bose-Einstein condensate originates inside the CAL.</i>  <i>Source: NASA / JPL-Caltech / Tyler Winn</i> <br><br>  After obtaining BEC from rubidium, the research team is going to use the atoms of two different potassium isotopes.  In fact, commissioning work is now being carried out at CAL, so a long series of tests are needed to determine how well the device works well in microgravity conditions. <br><br>  ‚ÄúScientists from all over the world will not wait for permission to work on our facility,‚Äù says Kamal Odrihri, head of the CAL mission at JPL. than we will give this device into the hands of narrow specialists for serious work. ‚Äù  The stage of scientific research on the schedule starts in early September of this year and will last at least three years. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k6/n4/vu/k6n4vurerq7toiuipdbqsfltmge.jpeg"><br>  <i>CAL atomic physics specialists and JPL scientists David Avelyn, Ethan Elliott and Jason Williams (from left to right);</i>  <i>The photo was taken at the Earth Orbiting Missions Operation Center in JPL, from where CAL will be remotely controlled and configured.</i>  <i>The image on the screen in the background shows the installation directly onboard the ISS.</i>  <i>The work of Avelin, Elliott and Williams played a decisive role in getting the Bose-Einstein in the orbit of the world's first condensate.</i>  <i>Source: NASA / JPL-Caltech</i> <br><br>  The installation of cold atoms went into space on May 21, 2018 on the Cygnus orbital spacecraft from the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D1%2581">Wallops</a> Cosmodrome, Virginia.  CAL was developed and built at JPL, and funding for the project is shared between the International Space Station Program at the Lyndon Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Space Life and Physical Sciences Research and Applications Division (SLPSRA) of the Space Development Directorate and operational management of NASA missions, at NASA headquarters, Washington. <br><br>  <i>For more information, you can visit <a href="https://coldatomlab.jpl.nasa.gov/">the project website</a> .</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/418819/">https://habr.com/ru/post/418819/</a></p>
