  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Launch Visual Studio 2012 on Programmer Day!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://i.microsoft.com/visualstudio/11/images/visual_studio_logo.png"><br>  Today, on the programmer‚Äôs day, there will be a remarkable event - the release of a new product for developers - Visual Studio 2012.  In Microsoft Visual Studio 2012, there are many new development features for Windows 8, the Internet, SharePoint, mobile devices and cloud services, as well as application lifecycle management tools that help eliminate barriers between employees and reduce labor costs. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  What's new in Visual Studio 2012 </h4><br>  It's no secret that a new era has come for applications.  Devices that are always in touch and cloud services provide previously unavailable features.  Developers can connect to them from anywhere, creating first-class applications that will be instantly available to millions of users. <br><br>  That is why we consider Visual Studio 2012 one of its most significant releases.  This environment is specifically designed so that you can succeed in an environment where the most important thing is new ideas and the speed of their implementation.  The new version includes a very large number of changes.  You can learn more about them (in Russian) at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/library/bb386063.aspx">msdn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/library/bb386063.aspx</a> .  We also prepared for you short introductory videos that in 2-3 minutes will help you get acquainted with the capabilities of Visual Studio 2012. <br> <a href="http://www.techdays.ru/series/VS2012_Launch"><img src="http://img33.imageshack.us/img33/81/vsthumbsjpg.jpg" alt="image"><br></a>

    <h4>  New look </h4><br>  Since the launch of the environment you will notice that a lot has changed.  The interface has been completely rebuilt to simplify work and facilitate access to the daily used tools.  The toolbars have become simpler, the number of tabs has been reduced, and new ways have emerged to search the code.  All this will make it easier for you to navigate through the application and give you the opportunity to work as you prefer. <br><img src="http://img210.imageshack.us/img210/2439/image002jt.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Ready for Windows 8 </h4><br>  With the release of Windows 8, everything has changed significantly.  In Visual Studio 2012 there are new templates, designers, testing and debugging tools - all you need to create attractive applications in the shortest possible time.  At the same time, Blend for Visual Studio gives you a visual toolkit to take full advantage of the new Windows 8 interface. <br><img src="http://img801.imageshack.us/img801/5807/image003ok.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Advanced Web Development Tools </h4><br>  In terms of web development, Visual Studio 2012 also has everything you need - there are new templates, improved publishing tools and full support for new standards like HTML5 and CSS3, as well as the latest improvements in ASP.NET.  We also simplified debugging by creating a Page Inspector tool that allows you to interact with the page being created directly in the development environment.  Planning to enter the mobile market?  Using ASP.NET, you can use in your applications controls that are independently optimized for phones, tablets and other devices with small screens. <br><img src="http://img513.imageshack.us/img513/5288/image004ox.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Cloud support </h4><br>  Previously, everyone had to independently maintain their own servers.  Scaling up required significant investments in infrastructure.  Now you have access to an almost unlimited number of servers in the cloud and you can scale the memory and computational power at will.  As part of Visual Studio, you will find first-class tools for migrating applications to Windows Azure, including new templates and publishing options, support for distributed cache, and a reduced installation profile. <br><img src="http://img36.imageshack.us/img36/348/image005ct.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Business Application Support </h4><br>  You will also notice significant improvements in working with SharePoint, including new designers, templates and deployment options.  You can use the advanced application lifecycle management features for SharePoint, such as performance profiling, unit testing, and IntelliTrace.  Perhaps the most pleasant surprise will be LightSwitch, a tool that allows you to create working applications without intensive coding. <br><img src="http://img171.imageshack.us/img171/8691/image006qi.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Flexible processes and reliable application lifecycle management </h4><br>  As applications become more complex, you will need tools to help build teamwork.  That is why we have introduced a flexible approach to work.  Using Visual Studio and Team Foundation Server, you can implement flexible working methods according to your plan, without disrupting existing workflows.  You can also involve all employees in your work, as the environment allows you to track requests and feedback from all participants in the process. <br><img src="http://img222.imageshack.us/img222/2443/image007f.png" alt="image"><br>  You can also give us responsibility for managing the application lifecycle.  Using Team Foundation Service, you get all the functionality of ALM without having to maintain the appropriate infrastructure.  This allows even a small team to take advantage of version control, code analysis and flexible scheduling. <br><br><h4>  Time to study and create! </h4><br>  Of course, this is only a small part of news related to Visual Studio.  You can find by yourself at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/library/bb386063.aspx">msdn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/library/bb386063.aspx</a> many more improvements when working with code, managing the life cycle of applications and conducting development.
