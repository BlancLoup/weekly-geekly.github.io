The sound of FPC drums is not quite realistic (although not at all realistic), of course there is an opportunity to download additional sounds from the Internet, but the quality will not change much from this.  This is where we will need <b>EZdrummer</b> (this is not the only instrument of the drums, but we‚Äôll look at it here). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/0c/a3/0ca3535f71ff74f9bf377481bfa59f32.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Libraries were created at Avatar Studios in New York.</i>  <i>When recording, real well-tuned drum sets were used.</i>

      <b>EZdrummer is</b> designed to create "live" styles of drum parts, the concept of the program is to bring the instrument as close as possible to the live drummer's game.  In this plugin there are no newfangled sounds in the style of electronic music.  EZdrummer can satisfy the most demanding arranger and sound producer.  At its core, EZdrummer is the younger brother of the wonderful BFD program, which is very widespread in music circles.  The difference concerns a somewhat simplified interface, where there are no unnecessary details, and less voluminous libraries of sounds.  The quality of sound programs differ little, although EZDrummer has 16-bit libraries. <br><br>  The difference of this program from the usual sampling library is that EZdrummer is a complete integrated solution, it provides not only sounds, but also special style game patterns in the form of prepared MIDI tracks.  In addition, the user has a fairly large field of activity in terms of creating a studio sound picture, for example, adding the sound of the room in which the recording was made, adjust the levels of microphones that remove the sound from the drums. <br><br>  <b>EZdrummer libraries:</b> <br><ul><li>  <b>Pop / Rock (default)</b> - a standard set of drums, often used and the most common. </li><li>  <b>Drumkit From Hell</b> is a library for heavy music lovers.  The famous guitar player Mattias Eklund took an active part in creating the library.  The library is recorded in Sweden.  It contains specific style-specific MIDI files. </li><li>  <b>Vintage Rock Brushes / Sticks</b> - this sound library was created in order to get a rich "vintage" sound of old Ludwig drums, which were once played by the Beatles. </li><li>  <b>Latin Percussion</b> - the use of this library covers a wide range of musical styles from jazz to modern electronic music. </li></ul>  <b>Creating lots</b> <br><br>  Making drums lots is tedious.  MIDI ‚Äúpadding‚Äù is very different (for the worse) from the sound of a live installation recorded in a studio.  When creating a party, you need to have the tools (sounds), to know well the specifics of the person‚Äôs game, to build the strength and emotion of the strike. <br><br>  EZdrummer provides unique features that greatly facilitate the programming of drums, which makes it possible to get results even for beginners.  EZdrummer solves many problems and reduces all the work in listening and selecting the necessary files. <br><br>  In the EZdrummer window that opens: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/9b/8d/9b8d8954ee17a063ed76ca7df6dee2b8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Clicking on the button <b>Open Grooves</b> you get to the menu where you can select the desired riff.  To facilitate the search there is a button preview.  After selecting the desired riff, you just need to drag it into the sequencer window onto the EZdrummer track. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/54/26/542642a3253307efeba42313dd0486a0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Further, if necessary, in the Piano roll you can edit the part. <br><br>  <b>Mixing setup</b> <br><br>  After the party is created, the creation of a sound color begins.  When you click on the <b>Open Mixer</b> button, you get to the mixer window, where you can fine-tune the sound of each installation tool, install a reverser, etc. <br><br>  <a href="http://prostopleer.com/tracks/4526724fJ5g">Drum Show (Drumkit From Hell Library Riffs)</a> <br><br><h4>  Bas-guitar </h4><br>  Bass guitar can be written on <b>Slayer 2</b> , but with the initial settings of this instrument is a bit bad.  To bring the sound to a more or less similar to the bass guitar, you need to do a few not tricky settings. <br><br>  First, pick up the volume of the instrument, by default it is very loud and overloads the channel, then in the <b>Slayer 2</b> settings select the <b>Bass Ebass 3</b> or <b>Bass Ebass 4 library</b> and install the <b>cab</b> in the <b>combo</b> (as shown in the figure).  You can also conjure with the frequencies bass (bass), middle (middle), treble (high). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/86/28/8628321a3ac54889c3c401ecbe3103b0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You can use the Soundgoodizer effect to expand the sound (more deep and deep) of the Bass.  To add an effect, set Bass to a separate channel in the mixer, and select the Soundgoodizer effect in this channel (as shown in the figure below). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/5b/40/5b40540096b8f207aec69e68ae1c75d9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>You can also use the following tools to record Bass:</b> <br><ul><li>  Bornemark Broomstick Bass </li><li>  Steinberg virtual bassist </li><li>  Yellow Tools Majestic </li><li>  EWQL Hardcore Bass </li><li>  Direct Bass Free (+ NI Kontact) </li><li>  Scarbee J-Slap'n Fingered (+ Halion) </li><li>  Sacrbee Black Bass (+ NI Kontact) </li></ul>  <b>Several demonstrations:</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://prostopleer.com/tracks/44755155c9u">Demo 1</a> <br>  <a href="http://prostopleer.com/tracks/4475484kMgl">Demo 2</a> <br><br>  Successes to you in realization of your creativity. <br><br>  <i>Continued: Violins, cellos, pianos ...
