      Understanding the principles of arithmetic, elementary, general and linear algebra, mathematical and non-standard analysis, set theory, general topology, projective and affine geometry is desirable, but not necessary. <br><br>  During the experiments, no infinity suffered. <br><br><h2>  Prologue </h2><br>  Going beyond the box is a natural process of finding new knowledge.  But not every search brings new knowledge and therefore benefits. <br><br><h2>  1. Actually, everyone has already divided everything up to us! </h2><br><h3>  1.1 Affine expansion of the number line </h3><br>  To begin with, from what begin, probably, all adventurers when dividing by zero.  Recall the function graph <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c58/894/1d6/c588941d69554bb2b1790119229d6c4f.png" height="28">  . <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e7/f22/079/8e7f220795e54151be6c8666dc37d3c5.png"></div><br>  To the left and to the right of zero, the function goes in different directions of ‚Äúnon-existence‚Äù.  In the very zero, ‚Äúpool‚Äù and nothing is visible. <br><br>  Instead of rushing into the "pool" with your head, let's see what flows in and out of there.  To do this, we use the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB_%25D1%2584%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">limit</a> - the main tool for <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7">mathematical analysis</a> .  The main ‚Äútrick‚Äù is that the limit allows you to go to a given point as close as possible, but not ‚Äústep on it‚Äù.  Such a "fence" before the "pool." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d79/f7e/770/d79f7e770f4a45a78c7ac91240673641.png"><br>  <a href="http://acomics.ru/~limitman/10">Original</a> <br><br>  Well, the "fence" set.  Not so scary anymore.  We have two paths to the pool.  Let's go to the left - a steep descent, to the right - a steep climb.  How many do not go to the "fence", it does not become closer.  To cross the lower and upper "non-existence" does not go.  There are suspicions, maybe we go in a circle?  Although no, the numbers change, it means not in a circle.  We rummage in the trunk with the tools of mathematical analysis yet.  In addition to the limits with the "fence" in the kit, there is a positive and negative <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C">infinity</a> .

At the end of each path is a small "fence."  By a strange coincidence, the same "fence" was both at the bottom and at the top of "being."

For infinitely large <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C">potential infinity</a> (two or one - it does not matter), is divided into many <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C">actual infinities</a> .  On the one hand, we complicate (we lose the possibility of absorption / neglect).  On the other hand, we acquire the possibility of comparing infinitely small and infinitely large quantities.  This means that we can consider infinity as numbers. <br><br>  For function <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c58/894/1d6/c588941d69554bb2b1790119229d6c4f.png" height="28">  the current infinities to the left and right of zero are equal (by module, that is, not taking the sign into account), since: <br><ul><li>  on both sides of the path (the number of elements that need to go) from zero to infinity is the same; </li><li>  the approximation algorithm (the formula in the form of a fraction) is the same; </li><li>  the minus sign in the algorithm does not affect the speed or acceleration of approaching infinity. </li></ul><br>  It should be noted that the specified criteria are arbitrary and are not given to the formal definitions of non-standard analysis. <br><br>  For further discussion, the concept of actual infinity is no longer required.  We return to the familiar world where we will operate on the concept of infinity, implying potential infinity. <br></blockquote><br>  Well, the limits are the same.  Now, it seems, everything is ready to bridge the gap between them. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a56/1c6/dad/a561c6dad50e4a45a94287c9b04a5501.png" height="150"></div><br>  In the mathematical model using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_line">projective extension of the number line</a> , the division by zero is defined. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/87d/275/245/87d275245a7d45f9b5c9fee60bdb7b4f.png"></div><br>  It seems that our problem is solved.  However, we will not be in a hurry, let's see what the consequences are.  In addition to the division, the following operations are defined in the system (recall that the infinity is unsigned). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e1/ef0/de9/8e1ef0de9b2e4903a27252a7a69c36ce.png"></div><br>  Almost all of them with additional conditions, it is alarming.  But let's not hurry, better look at the list of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_(mathematics)">undefined</a> operations: <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dda/41a/dbe/dda41adbe78444b8b61e3bb0d9afa561.png"></div><br>  Let's see how the distribution law will behave.  Substitute in it certain values ‚Äã‚Äãand perform the required operations. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f8f/104/5c7/f8f1045c739d454b93885e66d997574b.png" height="120"></div><br>  As a result, some of the identities cease to behave as we are used to.  However, they did not disappear without a trace.  The distribution law only works from right to left (i.e., in the case where the right-hand side of equality is defined).  This is one of the clearest examples of negative consequences.  Other identities are preserved in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_line">more or less stable</a> form. <br><br>  Summing up: <br><ol><li>  The usual behavior of identities has changed.  To operate them, you need to not forget about the new additional conditions. </li><li>  The usual behavior of zero is distorted.  We are accustomed to reasoning, if we take something zero times, then there will be zero.  However, in this algebraic system, the product of zero at infinity is not defined.  Accordingly, an algebraic expression with variables in which such an entry occurs, for example. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5be/395/449/5be395449c164b67999115c354a48a98.png" height="18">  , can not be simplified unilaterally. </li><li>  The possibility of the usual comparison disappears.  A more-or-less comparison is defined only on part of the space.  For example, the comparison of real numbers with infinity is not defined. </li><li>  The resulting algebraic structure is not a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5_(%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0)">field</a> in terms of general algebra.  Distributive law is violated (shown above).  Also, there is no inverse element for infinity (the product of this element and infinity should give a unit).  The latter can be considered as a consequence of the uncertainty of dividing infinity into infinity.  But still it should be understood that this is a gross simplification.  The strict definition of the inverse element is not related to the division operation. </li></ol><br>  The bottom line.  Old approaches have stopped working.  The complexity of the system, in the form of a heap ‚Äúif‚Äù, ‚Äúfor all but‚Äù, etc., has increased.  We had only two uncertainties 1/0 and 0/0 (we did not consider power operations), it became five.  Disclosing one uncertainty gave rise to even more uncertainties. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a36/062/50a/a3606250a1a74d618a8485c21b27f210.png" height="140"></div><br><h2>  1.2 Wheel </h2><br>  On the introduction of unsigned infinity, everything did not stop.  In order to get out of the uncertainties need a second wind. <br><br>  So, we have a set of real numbers and two uncertainties 1/0 and 0/0.  To eliminate the first, we performed a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_line">projective extension of the number line</a> (that is, we entered unsigned infinity).  Let's try to deal with the second uncertainty of the form 0/0.  Let's do the same.  Let's add the set of numbers with a new element representing the second uncertainty. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/949/e6d/b56/949e6db56b2646c2bef618d40de7f304.png"></div><br>  The definition of a division operation is based on multiplication.  It does not suit us.  Let's unbind operations from each other, but keep the usual behavior for real numbers.  We define a unary division operation, denoted by the sign "/". <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d6e/e5e/615/d6ee5e61590042929d6108ebc86beebf.png"></div><br>  We will define operations. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e6f/cb3/c86/e6fcb3c86ec24a01a4221642015e0474.png"></div><br>  This structure is called the ‚ÄúWheel‚Äù.  The term was taken because of the similarity with the topological picture of the projective extension of the numerical line and the point 0/0. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/650/496/b52/650496b526d5492d93d72aba00b12cf4.png" height="256"></div><br>  It seems everything looks good, but the devil is in the details: <br><ul><li>  Multiplying ‚àû or ‚ä• by zero does not give zero.  This leads to <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd6/2b0/5e1/cd62b05e1ef0495ba0a6181e1b3a9945.png" height="18">  in general. </li><li>  For ‚àû and ‚ä•, there are no inverse elements for both binary operations.  It means that <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b1/15a/2c9/2b115a2c9c6c46229f9570dfe83794ca.png" height="18">  by multiplication in the general case.  As a consequence, it is not possible to introduce a binary division operation covering the entire space. </li><li>  Symmetrical addition situation, <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/601/fb9/de8/601fb9de81eb4e8bbcfa2491d5bb7ba3.png" height="18">  in general. </li></ul><br>  In order to stabilize all the features, in addition to the expansion of the set of elements, a bonus is attached in the form of not one, but two identities describing distribution law. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bdd/7b4/35d/bdd7b435ddcc4788b0896b021ea6d753.png"></div><br>  <b>Mathematical language:</b> <br><blockquote>  From the point of view of <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25B1%25D1%2589%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0">general algebra,</a> we operated with a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5_(%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0)">field</a> .  And in the field, as is known, only two operations are defined (addition and multiplication).  The concept of division is derived through the inverse, and if even deeper, the unit elements.  The changes make our algebraic system into a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4">monoid</a> both by the addition operation (with zero as a neutral element) and by the multiplication operation (with a unit as a neutral element). <br><br>  In the works of the discoverers, the symbols ‚àû and ‚ä• are not always used.  Instead, you can see the entry as / 0 and 0/0. </blockquote><br>  The world is no longer so beautiful, is it?  Still, do not hurry.  Check whether the new identities of the distribution law can cope with our extended set <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/03f/d8c/362/03fd8c362a654af78b16287247893754.png" height="30">  . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b7/145/dec/7b7145dec0ad4b979b225add0250c090.png" height="120"></div><br>  This time the result is much better. <br><br>  Summing up: <br><ol><li>  All operations are well defined and there is no possibility of "falling overboard." </li><li>  Elementary algebra is a special case of the wheel.  If we drop the add-ins ‚àû and ‚ä• (that is, we can again assert that <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/825/3a9/595/8253a959562b40b2aa0935cbd76f8e18.png" height="18">  and <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/331/58e/1d7/33158e1d75204653be81240451c0771c.png" height="18">  ), then all formulas will degenerate into familiar ones. </li><li>  Feels like everything that was ‚Äúundefined‚Äù (Undefined) during projective extension was indicated by the symbol <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0de/847/336/0de847336615436e9365a603bdfae812.png" height="22">  .  This object also absorbs everything that it encounters as well as ‚Äúundefined‚Äù.  All the gaps where uncertainties appeared during the projective expansion were plugged with this object. </li></ol><br>  The bottom line.  Algebra works fine.  However, the notion of ‚Äúundefined‚Äù was taken as a basis, which was considered to be something existing and operate with it.  One day someone will say that everything is bad and you need to break this ‚Äúundefined‚Äù into several more ‚Äúundefined‚Äù, but smaller. General algebra will say: ‚ÄúNo problem, Bro!‚Äù. <br>  Approximately the additional (j and k) imaginary units in <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">quaternions</a> are postulated like this. <br><br>  It is worth noting that there are other algebraic systems with division.  For example, "meadows" (common meadows).  They are slightly simpler, since they do not expand the space by introducing new elements.  The goal is achieved as in the wheels, the transformation of the operations of addition and multiplication, as well as the rejection of binary division. <br><br>  The ability to "move the unknown" for mathematics is the norm.  But all these wrappers do not give an answer to the main question, what is there inside? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/805/916/807/80591680717045ae9491ca92df0dc35a.png" height="150"></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Useful literature</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Setzer, Anton (Drafts): Wheels, 1997 ( <a href="http://www.cs.swan.ac.uk/~csetzer/articles/wheel.pdf">pdf</a> ) </li><li>  Carlstr√∂m, Jesper: Wheels - on division by zero, 2001 ( <a href="http://www2.math.su.se/reports/2001/11/2001-11.pdf">pdf</a> ) </li><li>  PJ Potts: Exact Real Arithmetic using M√∂bius Transformations, 1998 ( <a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ae/papers/potts-phd.pdf">pdf</a> ) </li><li>  Jan A.
