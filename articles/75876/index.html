(C) <br>  The results of the labor market research system administrators are ready.  The admins themselves painstakingly filled out questionnaires with questions about work.  salary and specialization.  Based on the data obtained, such a study was born. <br>  Relevance - November 2009. <br>  Under the cut - the current state of the labor market system administrators, the average wages in the cities, the unemployment rate among IT professionals, as well as secret information about what you need to learn to earn more :) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Labor Market System Administrators in 2009 </h4><br><br>  In November 2009, Aydeko, the developer of the Ideco ICS Internet gateway, conducted a study of the employment market for system administrators in Russia and the CIS countries with an emphasis on qualitative changes over the past year.  More than 8,000 system administrators, IT professionals and IT department managers took part in the survey.  The purpose of the study is to track current market trends, identify factors affecting successful employment, stable work and wage growth, as well as consider the situation in the regions and in major cities of the country. <br><br>  Research data was obtained as a result of an anonymous survey of system administrators and IT professionals.  Participants completed a detailed questionnaire with questions about the current situation and changes related to the crisis.

      The research results most fully reflect the current situation in the labor market.  The real data obtained as a result of a personal first-hand survey reflects a true picture of the employment of system administrators.  This distinguishes the study from brief job reviews and resumes that provide data only on the wishes of employers and employees. <br><br>  Despite the negative forecasts, more than 80% of respondents said that they have been working in their places of work for more than a year.  Only 5% of specialists are currently not employed and are in search, this figure is even less than the official unemployment rate in 2009. <br><br>  Only 7% of specialists are faced with the need to change jobs due to the crisis.  At the same time, 3/4 of them not only found a new place, but also have been working for more than 6 months. <br><br>  More than half of respondents say that recently the amount of work has increased.  At the same time, wages grew only at every fifth specialist, on average by 10-15%. <br><br><h5>  Average salary and geography </h5><br><br>  The average salary ranges from 22-23 thousand rubles in small cities, 26-27 thousand rubles in million-plus cities and up to 37 thousand and 48 thousand in St. Petersburg and Moscow, respectively. <br><br>  System administrators who have the skills to work with Unix (Linux) servers are paid 20-30% more than the administrators of Windows servers, regardless of where they live.  At the same time, knowledge of both platforms is not always valued more than knowledge of one of them. <br><br><img src="http://www.ideco-software.ru/jobs2009/img/1.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>average salary</i> <br><br>  The average wage in Russia as a whole is 10-15% higher than the average wage of IT specialists in Ukraine.  This difference is most noticeable for IT managers. <br><h5>  Crisis changes in various cities </h5><br><br>  Almost half of the respondents noted that their wages had not changed.  There are positive trends - about a third of specialists began to receive more than a year ago. <br><br>  Russian system administrators and other IT specialists note changes in the level of remuneration.  About 47% say their wages are stable, while the rest have experienced wage changes.  In the table below you will find the size of changes in the level of wages (in% of the total number of respondents). <br><br><img src="http://www.ideco-software.ru/jobs2009/img/10.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Crisis changes in various cities</i> <br><br>  Changes in the level of wages are not always associated with the impact of the crisis.  The volume of work, the scale of networks and the needs of employers are changing.  More than half of the respondents noted that the amount of work has increased significantly, and only 16% can note a decrease in the number of tasks. <br><br>  Change in workload over the past year: <br><br><img src="http://www.ideco-software.ru/jobs2009/img/8small.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Change in workload over the past year</i> <br><br><h5>  Salary changes depending on specialization </h5><br><br>  Most system administrators have not changed their salary for the last year. <br><br>  Only 30% of respondents say that their incomes have fallen.  At the same time, the reduction in salaries has affected, mainly, windows-network administrators and those who own the server setup on Windows and Unix platforms (Linux).  Among the administrators of Unix (Linux) networks, the level of remuneration, basically, either did not change or grew. <br><br><img src="http://www.ideco-software.ru/jobs2009/img/5.gif" alt="image"><br>  <i>Salary changes depending on specialization</i> <br><br><h5>  Working position stability </h5><br><br>  A stable position in the workplace depends on the level of education and work experience. <br><br>  Among all specialists with higher education, the unemployment rate is lower than among other groups.  At the same time, experience of 6 months or more is considered essential. <br><br>  IT specialists with incomplete higher, secondary special and secondary education and work experience of less than 6 months turned out to be the most vulnerable in a crisis.  They account for almost half of all those who are currently looking for work. <br><br>  Additional education has virtually no effect on the demand for a specialist in the labor market.  And those who rely on their own experience, and those who are engaged in self-learning and obtaining certificates, can count on the same level of remuneration and stability. <br><br>  The most common reason for changing jobs for system administrators is personal desire related to growth opportunities in other companies.  The crisis as the reason for changing jobs is called, basically, those who at the moment did not get a new place.  Basically, these are specialists with little (up to six months) experience in the field of IT. <br><br><img src="http://www.ideco-software.ru/jobs2009/img/9.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Reasons for changing jobs</i> <br><br><h5>  findings </h5><br><br>  The labor market of system administrators and IT professionals in Russia is stable.  Many experts work on the last job a year or more.  The number of unemployed system administrators is about 5% - less than the official unemployment rate in the country.  Basically, these are specialists during the transition from one company to another. <br><br>  Most of the specialists leave employers on their own initiative.  Most of the free specialists find their jobs on conditions not worse than those of the previous employer. <br><br>  The stability of the working position is influenced by both education and work experience.  The more experience, the less chance of being dismissed due to the impact of the crisis. <br><br>  Additional education and the desire for new knowledge practically does not affect the level of remuneration.  Both certified and self-trained system administrators can count on successful employment. <br><br>  An experienced system administrator with the administration skills of Unix (Linux) servers can expect a good level of remuneration and stable work regardless of where they live.  The average salary of such specialists is 10‚Äì20% higher than that of simple system administrators. <br><br>  The full text of the study, as well as additional data in pdf format, can be found on our website: <a href="http://www.ideco-software.ru/jobs2009/">http://www.ideco-software.ru/jobs2009/</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75876/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75876/</a></p>
