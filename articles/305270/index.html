  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Welcome</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We are a young development team from St. Petersburg (although people from different cities and even countries cooperate with us), and we are glad to welcome you in our first publication.  We are called " <a href="https://www.timevizor.com/ru">TimeVizor</a> " and promote the software application and service with the same name (English TimeVizor). <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Why TimeVizor?  We want to create an elegant time monitoring solution that a freelancer (or full-time employee) spends at work, tied to it the functions of calculating wages, analyzing the efficiency of time worked and much more that is usually required by customers and performers.  Both functions are highly demanded by both, since they allow you to work transparently, honestly, in a controlled and efficient manner. <br><br>  Members of our team have extensive experience with similar applications and in the market of Internet freelancing as a whole, we are well aware of the disadvantages (as well as advantages) of existing solutions, and we can confidently say that we have something to offer the market.  The product is almost ready and passes only the final polishing.

      TimeVizor is not a surveillance program for employees.  This is primarily a tool for building relationships with remote employees and freelancers who work on a flexible schedule and often do not have a fixed working day and equally fixed pay.  This is a tool for honest calculation of time worked and, accordingly, its payment.  Additional functions allow the customer and the contractor to communicate with each other and analyze the effectiveness of the work.  Such solutions are used on the largest freelance stock exchanges, and millions of freelancers compete with each other to record as many hours worked as possible, which, moreover, are reflected in their profiles.  However, such solutions have several disadvantages. <br><br><h3>  What problems we want to solve </h3><br>  First of all, we want to offer an effective tool for startups and freelancers, not tied to freelance sites and not burdening both parties with unclear expenses.  A startup is a risky thing at first, and extra expenses can simply cancel all plans. <br><br>  Here is a simple example.  An Internet entrepreneur has an interesting idea and a certain capital for its implementation.  He is looking for people who will help him achieve this goal.  He goes to the well-known and popular freelance website, where he is recruiting specialists.  These may be remote employees, but not necessarily them.  At first, our startup is completely satisfied: the work is on, the idea develops, people get what they earn. <br><br>  But he discovers that the popular freelance service is not as wonderful as it seemed at first - he needs to unbind a considerable percentage.  Although the site as a whole is not bad, such expenses are simply unacceptable in conditions of austerity.  What to do?  Many Internet entrepreneurs and even large companies faced this.  When the task of accounting for working time in an organization arises, they often resort to the services of exchanges that supply the appropriate tracker software. <br><br>  However, such programs may charge substantial fees, expressed in a simple percentage of the money received by employees.  The more people you paid, the more you need to pay for the program, although its work has not changed.  If a technically very simple program takes a lot of money for its work, which can reach thousands of dollars a month, it is impossible not to think: is it worth it?  TimeVizor effectively removes these problems, because it is not tied to any exchange and allows you to work independently.  All tariffs are expressed at a fixed rate, not as a percentage. <br><br>  Another problem with some well-known solutions is the low accuracy of time measurement (for example, 10 minutes each) or the desire to round off time in one direction or another.  In this situation, it is especially difficult for companies to take into account work time.  TimeVizor considers time honestly and accurate to the minute. <br><br>  Some similar decisions on the market are more focused on the personal organization of labor of the worker and have little connection with the employer.  TimeVizor also allows you to organize working time, but at the same time provides the employer with powerful controls.  One way or another, control is necessary if implemented correctly.  TimeVizor client works in the background, does not distract from work at all and costs almost no system resources. <br><br><h3>  Some functions and features of TimeVizor </h3><br><ul><li>  Calculation of hours worked up to a minute without rounding. </li><li>  Take screenshots of your desktop at a specified interval (optional). </li><li>  Shooting photo frames from a webcam at a specified interval (optional). </li><li>  Add arbitrary lengths of time manually. </li><li>  Extremely low load on computer resources. </li><li>  Background work that does not distract the user. </li><li>  Access to all statistics of work online through any browser (both for the freelancer and for the customer). </li><li>  Send weekly job reports to email. </li><li>  Fixed payment without reference to the volume of work performed. </li><li>  High-quality technical support. </li><li>  Free trial period of two weeks. </li></ul><br>  And that's not all, because in our immediate plans: <br><br><ul><li>  Accounting for work in specific applications and specific websites. </li><li>  Construction of a comparative analysis of employee performance. </li><li>  Instant messaging through TimeVizor between group members. </li><li>  Instant e-mail notifications about critical actions of employees (for example, entering social networks). </li><li>  Proxy server support, including NTLM. </li><li>  And etc. </li></ul><br>  Inside our team, we ourselves actively use TimeVizor and we can confidently say that he is already helping to organize the work of a large number of people at a completely new level.  You can download our program from <a href="https://www.timevizor.com/ru">timevizor.com</a> , try it out and write to us about your impressions.  Over time, we plan to create a real office productivity combine with unprecedented functionality among competitors. <br><br>  We want to fill this blog with informative stories about the use of TimeVizor, about the problems we solve, as well as just interesting thoughts from the field of freelancing, time management and management in general.  We hope you will be interested with us! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/305270/">https://habr.com/ru/post/305270/</a></p>
