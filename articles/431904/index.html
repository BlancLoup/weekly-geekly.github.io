This is not about know-how, but about standard solutions that work effectively. <br><br>  So, the story takes place in the company of the chemical industry, where about 8 thousand people work in several geographically distributed objects.  Each such facility has its own personnel department.  All workers from time to time need to get help and in a constant mode - payment sheets.  Previously, they came to personnel officers who spent on preparing and sorting all the documentation (some of the documents are sent to the workshops, some - to the mines) quite a lot of working time.  Moreover, 85% of requests - is the issuance of documents that do not require signing.  That is why the customer asked us to automate typical processes for issuing payment sheets.  The remaining requests, for example, for issuing certificates, still require manual processing: stamps and signatures. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  How does the process of issuing documents and certificates usually work? </h3><br>  In most cases, in any large enterprise there are several personnel workers who are responsible for preparing and issuing certificates, documents, application forms, and updating information about employees.  In fact, the entire process of personnel workflow passes through them.  Then the documents are sent to the heads of the departments, after them - to the heads of departments and brigades, and only after that the papers get to the ordinary employees.  The process can take 3-4 days.  In addition to the labor costs of personnel officers, employees who need to get a pay sheet or, for example, a 2-NDFL certificate, have to spend time on the way to the personnel department twice: to order a certificate and then receive it.

    <h3>  How this process works now </h3><br>  We have placed informational kiosks at customer sites.  In appearance, they are very reminiscent of those that each of us remembers at the machines for paying bills for mobile communication.  Thanks to the kiosks, it turned out to minimize the problem of the physical treatment of employees to personnel officers.  Now, if the document does not require signing and printing, you can get it in a couple of minutes right in the hallway of the shop where employees work without equipped workplaces. <br><br><h3>  What does a kiosk consist of? </h3><br>  The basis of the kiosk is a computer and a printer, as well as a protective 19 ‚Äùtouchscreen, HID card reader, EM-Marine, audio playback speakers and an uninterruptible power supply.  The reader allows employees to log in to the system using a username and password.  Printing of documents is available in A5 or A4 format, two-sided. <br><br><h3>  How does all this work? </h3><br>  Each employee, leaning against the reader of the kiosk pass, can print out any memo and instruction sheet, checklist, time sheet, information on holidays and see the balance of treatment-and-prophylactic nutrition.  At the same time, employee authorization is required every time: the kiosk does not store the user's session.  Now there are 14 application forms in the system, plus we added a help order form: an employee fills out the required fields with the help of hardware prompts, and then receives a certificate that you only need to sign in the personnel department.  This greatly speeds up the process.  The software on the kiosks accesses the personnel system data through the created application server or proxy server, collects the information and generates the necessary document. <br><br>  A short time after the start of the project, we also added registration for employees in the SMS service.  In it you can see the five most frequent requests and payroll. <br>  At one of the facilities we added registration to the DMS Dentistry.  The process is organized as follows: the curator recruits a group of employees who need the help of a dentist, then goes to the clinic and writes down all those who wish.  We have simplified the process of collecting applications using the kiosk.  It turned out a kind of electronic queue: the employee fills out an application through a kiosk, gets a serial number, understands how many people are in front of him.  A curator receives a list of employees who must be recorded at the reception.  In addition, at the request of the customer, we installed a ticker in the kiosks, which broadcast relevant information for employees, a list of social programs, corporate date and so on. <br><br>  With regard to monitoring the performance of the kiosks: in a constant mode, the kiosk and the printer in it are monitored in order to track down critical readings.  For example, toner or paper runs out, paper jams, interruptions in communications.  If any of these situations occurs, an automatic notification will be sent to the support desk.  While the problem is solved, pussies go offline with disabilities. <br><br><h3>  Some more technical details </h3><br>  As I said, the kiosk is a computer and a printer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nk/42/4v/nk424vkaisukattx1jro4snvhvq.png"><br><br>  We developed the software for it ourselves.  It is responsible for the authorization of employees, integrates with the mail, so that requests for certificates (which require signing) are automatically sent by e-mail to the personnel department.  In addition, there is monitoring of terminals and printers, monitoring the availability of the backend, settings and remote access. <br><br>  As for service: at each customer site there is a support service that receives notifications in case of breakdowns or standard force majeure when the paper runs out, for example.  And tech support software takes place remotely with us. <br><br>  We also tested the kiosk in our office on an engineering sample.  Here, for example, set up a set of references necessary for a specific customer: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-l/d3/me/-ld3me0mpvinlj0ebm45iujmyoa.png"><br><br>  Some interface: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/44/9l/sk/449lsk9_5uxxcvqtfzut7lk4id8.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/om/tl/df/omtldfalym8i8b0bvxi9fy0crra.png"><br><br>  By the way, besides references, you can also get information about the experience: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sy/ir/mm/syirmma5yntlpq054jfwneppdhk.png"><br><br>  Running a little forward: now we are implementing the second version of the project.  It's all the same, only in the mobile application. <br><br>  The interface is generally the same: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ot/8b/9y/ot8b9ykvmxluhykqlqhyefw9o2c.png"><br><br>  By the way, we can deliver new installations as a managed service (that is, for a monthly fee, and not standardly - for a project).  It all depends on the needs of the customer. <br><br>  If you have any questions, I will be happy to answer: dakulov@croc.ru </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/431904/">https://habr.com/ru/post/431904/</a></p>
