  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to create effective mobile solutions for enterprises</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  More recently, communication issues were resolved on paper, telephone conversations and personal meetings.  With the advent of personal computers, then local area networks, and then the Internet, the necessary questions seemed to be resolved: we see emails, reports, tables, pictures, presentations, and interfaces of various software on the screens of our monitors. <br><br>  But there is a very important point - we can not be tied around the clock to the workplace and these monitors.  We are dynamic.  Business should follow us and in no case should not lag behind.  We should not waste precious hours or days for making tactical decisions, no matter where we are: on the street, underground, in the sky or on the water. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Daily life will never be the same.  The queues at the banks will disappear, the exhibition organizers will refuse paper information materials, and a full trip to the store will replace a couple of pressed keys on the smartphone.  The working process will change radically - managers will quickly receive tasks, get acquainted with them and perform them on the screen of their devices.  Friends, (pause) welcome to the era of mobility.

      Mobile technologies and the mobile Internet have come into our lives, deeply penetrating its context.  Mobile devices are always at hand, they almost always have an Internet connection, and the abundance of various applications allows us to use them almost for all occasions: at home and at work. <br><br>  Practically in any sphere of the industry (both in small business and in large corporations) there is a question of automating business processes, which allow to significantly reduce overhead costs while increasing production capacity.  Accessible and convenient communication channels, management and operational analysis of business processes, as well as timely impact on them is the key to effective work of companies. <br><br>  In this regard, Business requires new features and tools for: <br><ul><li>  remote control; </li><li>  continuous communication; </li><li>  process control; </li><li>  rapid response. </li></ul><br>  The use of mobile technologies in the corporate sphere allows us to bring the corporate context into the context of the life of employees, predetermining an increase in the efficiency of business processes.  Improving business efficiency depends not only on the intracorporate use of mobile solutions, the provision of a mobile interface for external clients in the form of various personal accounts plays a major role, allowing the user to provide fast and convenient management of the services provided by the company.  Thus, it is a mobile platform with constantly evolving technologies and capabilities that can solve all of the identified business requirements. <br><br>  Technology does not stand still, everything changes.  The market for various technological solutions does not have time to adapt to this pace of development.  Many traditional standalone designs die already at the stage of their implementation.  Such decisions entail high rates of TTM (time-to-market), high cost of ownership, lack of application management by the corporation, lack of analytics. <br><br>  Adaptive solutions are needed with the possibility of fast and convenient centralized customization of the logic and functionality of the working interface in a mobile device.  It is necessary to combine all existing services and business processes of the corporation into a single clear interface, providing the possibility of data aggregation.  In the traditional development of mobile solutions, there are some difficulties, for example, ensuring the operation of the mobile office on virtually any mobile platforms and devices.  When developing applications, it is necessary to take into account all these platforms, their versions, devices of various manufacturers, their models and types, and different screen resolutions.  Thus, each operating system requires its own development team, both for developing and supporting mobile solutions. <br><br>  Using the principles of building a service-oriented architecture in the creation of mobile services and applications solves the tasks, without the disadvantages of the traditional development of standalone solutions.  This approach allows you to build a high-quality and flexible business process management system on mobile platforms.  The SOA (server-oriented architecture) paradigm allows you to integrate all existing independent services (such as ERP, CRM, SCM, BPM billing, bookkeeping) as a set of services that perform their specific functions into a single interface. <br><br>  This approach provides the following benefits: <br><br>  <u>Technological:</u> <br><ul><li>  fast and flexible scaling and development of services, including through external resources; </li><li>  platform independence. </li></ul><br><br>  <u>Operating:</u> <br><ul><li>  reducing the requirements for expertise (the company should not hire experts in areas that are often not relevant to the company's activities); </li><li>  geographical and temporary independence of business: it can be conducted from anywhere and anytime - the service is available everywhere and always. </li></ul><br><br>  <u>Financial:</u> <br><ul><li>  Low cost of ownership solution. </li></ul><br><br>  How to effectively meet the needs of its customers by providing versions of mobile applications for all devices and operating systems?  Well, there are three choices: <br><ul><li>  lay out and spread a tidy sum for the development of mobile software for all devices and operating systems, as well as their support and updates; </li><li>  save, but give oneself to slavery (in the literal sense) one or two operating systems; </li><li>  or take the SOA paradigm, the choice is yours. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/145156/">https://habr.com/ru/post/145156/</a></p>
