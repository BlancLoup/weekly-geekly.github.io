  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How smart can you make your home?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today we want to tell you the stories of several people who have improved their home, how much it cost them and how much it has raised the value of a house on the market. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b87/7ac/877/b877ac877d694c4d8b46aedc4922f678.jpg"><br><br>  And we begin with the professional designer Carlos Espinosa (Carlos Espinosa), who lives in Boulder (Colorado).  His home can be considered ‚Äúsmart‚Äù as much as is possible in our time - the light controlled from his phone, the security system, leakage sensors, sending alerts and a fully integrated stereo system. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Carlos himself says that what has changed his life the most is the on / off light system inside the house.  The light automatically lights up as soon as it turns the corner and turns off behind it.  All this is coordinated from his phone (which is very strange, because if he had forgotten the phone in the room, he would have walked in complete darkness, but we think there are motion sensors there too).  The front door is also unlocked when he approaches it.

      Installing his system took a total of about a year and about a few hundred dollars in equipment.  Espinoza spent about $ 300 on ten Philips Hue light bulbs and a SmartThing hub that integrates with his phone to turn them on and off (light bulbs).  His August Smart Lock is about $ 200 more.  Over time, he built Sonos (music system), with speakers controlled from the application, now this system costs $ 199 for the initial kit. <br><br>  He also pays for his security system supplied by the television provider Comcast once a month, how much, unfortunately, we do not know. <br><br>  Against this background, the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù Samsung refrigerator with three cameras for $ 5,000, presented at CES in January, for 5000USD will seem like a very expensive acquisition. <br><br>  Matt MacAdoo, sales consultant at Keller Williams (real estate company in Texas), part-time professional installer, asks for $ 95 an hour to install smart equipment to automate your home.  Work usually takes from a day to a week. <br><br>  Mat sold his smart home for $ 285,000 when an identical home costs $ 265,000.  therefore, he knows firsthand the value of installing smart systems. <br><br>  His house had wireless thermostats, external surveillance cameras at every corner of the building, a programmable lock, wires running in the walls to connect a TV, and even a centralized ‚Äúvacuum cleaner‚Äù system built into the walls - ‚ÄúJust turn it on, and the dust will go through the pipes in the walls "Says Mat. <br><br>  Danny Hetzberg (Danny Hetzberg) is an agent for the sale of real estate in a company located in Miami, California.  He says that for an extra $ 2,000, the buyer can ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù his house with any smart devices of his choice - thermostats, lighting and a home security system. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMaybe four or five years ago, in order to install these systems, you would need to hire a professional installer, spend about $ 30,000 and‚Äú open the walls ‚Äù.  Now everything has become so simple that you can do it yourself, ‚ÄùDanny says. <br><br>  According to Danny, about half the houses he sells have a Nest system. <br><br>  Jason Johnson, head of August, says that the peak of comfort in his house will come when he can ask his Amazon.com Echo system to turn off the lights in his living room while lying upstairs in bed. <br><br>  Jokingly, Johnson loves to close all his locks (and there are as many as five in their house) through his iPhone.  ‚ÄúThey all close at one time and it sounds like they lock up a prison for the night,‚Äù says John. <br><br>  Nowadays, ‚Äúsmart‚Äù home systems have become available for the ordinary user (well, not with the current dollar rate for the Russian market, of course) and their installation sometimes takes less than 10 minutes. <br><br> <a href="http://www.iridiummobile.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/214/22c/54b/21422c54b5394869b047fdf5324b87b4.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367983/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367983/</a></p>
