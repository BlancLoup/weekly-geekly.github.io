  <section class="page js-page"><h1>On the problem of promoting research and research</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Based on the article <a href="http://dmitrygusev.habrahabr.ru/blog/103133/">"Reduction of the solution of the NP-complete problem" 3-feasibility "to an algorithm with polynomial complexity</a> . <a href="http://dmitrygusev.habrahabr.ru/blog/103133/">"</a> <br><br>  The bottom line is that a professor at a Russian university can‚Äôt get his article published in a reputable foreign journal.  And as always, there are those who act on the principle of ‚Äúthe fool himself‚Äù, and instead of helping the council try to write something angry in response.  Since my comment in the topic few will see because of the unpopularity of the article, so I take it upon myself to dare to publish the answer in a separate post. <br><br>  The author of the article, of course, could describe in more detail the essence of the work, tell about the author, provide links to his other works, monographs, etc.  But the problem he talks about exists and nobody talks about it.  I had similar situations, so I‚Äôll share a little bit of experience and my own thoughts. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  1. Difference in scientific schools </h4><br>  The first and, perhaps, the most important problem is the conceptual differences in the Soviet and European scientific schools.  I recently had a conversation with the head of a research center at a German university.  The essence of the meeting was that the area of ‚Äã‚Äãmy scientific activity and their center were very similar.  There was a correspondence, which resulted in a personal meeting.  At the meeting, I made a presentation of my developments, provided research papers, which, in general, aroused interest.  But after an hour and a half conversation, the phrase was said: ‚ÄúIt's all good, but, unfortunately, in order to work with us, you need to be aware of our rules and established concepts, which, alas, your Ukrainian and Russian colleagues do not possess.  It's all about the schools.  It cannot be said that the Soviet scientific school is better or worse than the European one, it‚Äôs just <i>different</i> .  This does not allow us to work effectively with the ex-USSR. ‚Äù  This is how it is.

    <h4>  2. The difference in approaches </h4><br>  Let's look at the rules for writing scientific articles.  We have a scientific novelty of a new method, model, approach, method, scheme.  Note that there are no algorithms and their implementations in the list.  This means that we cannot implement a good system, after which we can patent it or write a scientific article based on it.  In the English-speaking scientific environment, most of the scientific publications on my topic are algorithms, implementations, and, sometimes, approaches.  And it works.  But not with us. <br><br><h4>  3. Lack of group work </h4><br>  How many people work with us to solve a problem?  Right one  And every year the same tasks solve everything, or, maximally, the same task, but they start everything from scratch.  We do not have the concept of integrated development at the level of PhD or doctoral work.  Only single development.  Sorry, but can you go it alone with Microsoft Research, MIT, Cambridge or Oxford? <br><br><h4>  4. Lack of communication skills </h4><br>  Many of the researchers are actively communicating with foreign colleagues, not to mention traveling abroad and sharing experience?  Many of the researchers never spoke outside the university, and if they did, it was all happening at the tick-drawing level.  When a person begins to read foreign works, his first feeling is the shock of understanding his meagerness. <br><br><h4>  5. Material resources and research </h4><br>  It is not accepted to carry out concept approval.  Something done, an article in some local magazine slapped - profit!  Why build clusters, write implementations, build graphs?  This occupation is not for us - they will not give money for it, but you will lose time.  And no one has heard from us about test data sets on which you can (need) test your results.  The problem is that we were not taught to do this, but in the west this is a de facto standard. <br><br><h4>  6. English </h4><br>  The entire scientific world, the main language is English.  It is in the scientific world, and in our spherical-scientific world the official language is abusive.  Get someone to write an article in English.  No, I said exactly to write, not to translate!  I agree, many people cannot write in Ukrainian (Russian) either, but this is no easier. <br><br><h4>  7. Attitude </h4><br>  Throughout the scientific world there is a leader (associate professor or professor) and several graduate students who are full members of the research team.  And only we have a graduate student - this is a man who still does not go anywhere from a submarine and will do everything in the cathedral kitchen, in addition to what he has to do - to write science. <br><br>  From a conversation between two professors: ‚ÄúYour graduate student will soon have a defense, why is he still walking straight?‚Äù  Yeah, after that, everyone ran upright and went to write scientific articles in foreign journals. <br><br>  And finally, why do you have all the candidate and doctor's papers in the archive for 20 years?  <i>To, God forbid, the production did not fall ...</i> <br><br>  I led all this to the fact that the problems of a single person are of no concern to anyone.  But the problem is not with a specific article or a specific person.  Perhaps the mentioned article contains shortcomings and some gaps, I suggest collectively helping a person with advice, references, experience.  I ask the community once again to pay attention to this article and help people get closer to their goal. <br><br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/103150/">https://habr.com/ru/post/103150/</a></p>
