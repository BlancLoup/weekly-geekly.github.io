    <h4>  Overall impression </h4><br>  1) They are doing something, but behind some kind of screen is incomprehensible.  what's going on there, what a hundred programmers are doing in a starlab - as a user, it is not clear to me (+1) <br><br>  2) I decided to try it, the first two days were impressed, and then it started what is usually a lot in a public toilet ... (-5) <br><br>  3) I have never seen even 1 Mbps with ten declared.  When signal quality is rated as ‚Äúgood‚Äù speed with 0.2 Mbps (-10) <br><br>  4) The overall impression from the iota to the acquisition was excellent.  How I started to use it - everything fell ... (-5) <br><br>  5) On the whole, it‚Äôs good, but it doesn‚Äôt work that the speed began to fall, the signal (+5) often broke off <br><br>  6) As an alternative network, Yota is quite good, as it is better not to use the main one (+1) <br><br>  7) This is super!  Internet from the air!  Despite the fact that at work, the management chopped off the half-fat of all the ‚Äúdelicious‚Äù things, this is the way out!  (+5) <br><br>  8) Excellent signal quality (albeit with an external antenna) in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãArt.  Builder on Yaroslavl sh.  24 db  5 mb / 1 mb.  For us, this is super !!!  (+10) <br><br>  9) very quickly install the BS (compared with opsosami)!  (+10) <br><br>  10) When opening it was all adequate, after commissioning is worse, since October the quality leaves much to be desired (-10) <br><br>  11) Initially, everything was fine, but in the last month there are problems with speed and subscriber service (it‚Äôs impossible to get through to the operator at all) (-10) <br><br>  12) And I became a tester-champion in Krasnoyadar and do not care for bad grades from MOSCOW !!!))) (+10) <br><br>  13) disgusting: the support service is frankly stupid and does nothing (and doesn‚Äôt react to tickets either, yes :), the network works like shit, that is, during the day it does not work at all (Moscow, m. Kurskaya), marketing rubs comments in zhezheshechke.  Preved, Savok.  Not -10 just because it works at least somehow.  (-five) <br><br>  14) It is completely unsuitable for corporate use - there is no stability either in speed or in signal level, nor by DNS queries (-1) <br><br>  15) The quality of services and service - disgusting.  I use it only because there is no alternative in the place of residence (Lyubertsy).  After the purchase (early June) everything flew, but the last 2 months is a complete nightmare.  Now I am writing a comment, and the connection is periodically broken.  If you can use another Internet, do not try to help these scammers with money.  (-ten) <br><br>  16) In the presence of a wired provider - it is better to use a wired one.  If you need a mobile Internet - it is better to use mobile operators.  (-five) <br><br>  17) overall impression, honestly spoils the lack of a constructive and respectful dialogue with the subscriber ... And then everything else ... no need to promise something if this is not in sight and will not be soon !!!  (-five) <br><br>  18) disappointed tomorrow I will go to take the Wi-Fi center (-5) <br><br>  19) The speed is comparable with GPRS (-10) <br><br>  20) It's good that they came to Sochi with their speeds and prices.  (+10) <br><br>  21) So far, there are no drivers for Mac Snow Leopard - it's just PPC.  (-ten) <br><br>  22) Muscovites zazhralis, for the regions super !!!  (+10) <br><br><h4>  Coverage Area </h4><br>  23) Coverage area is bad.  In the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãProfsoyuznaya street in Moscow and Krzhizhanovskogo street 337 kilobits / sec.  (-five) <br><br>  24) The zone is expanding rapidly, although it leaves much to be desired.  (+1) <br><br>  25) Between Mayakovskaya and Barrikadnaya is rather weak!  (+1) <br><br>  26) I use the Internet at several points in the city, everywhere there is a sure reception (+5) <br><br>  27) The pace of development of new territories is impressive (+5) <br><br>  28) Very weak coverage in densely built areas, Petrograd, Vaska ... (-10) <br><br>  29) in Moscow and St. Petersburg only a couple of times ran into the absence of a network or, more precisely, the network was, but it was so weak that it didn‚Äôt fry ... by essno according to the map ... the map is lying only in Moscow on the Ring Road where there is no signal or almost no 30% ring (+1) <br><br>  30) I catch almost everywhere in Moscow.  The building is heavier at the window better (+10) <br><br><h4>  Signal quality </h4><br>  31) I do not even know what to say here.  catches!  (+5) <br><br>  32) Signal quality is basically Poor, rarely - medium (Moscow, NAD, Vuchetich str. 14) (-5) <br><br>  33) -10 Today I dreamed that Yota has 4 strips ... I was happy.  And now in the coverage area in a multi-storey building, on the penultimate floor, my laptop is on the stack of books by the window.  One strip ... (-10) <br><br>  34) acceptable quality, where you need to catch (+10) <br><br>  35) Awful.  If they write a large coverage area and speed, then the signal must be confident.  Any time of the day!!!  (-ten) <br><br>  36) on Filevsky signal is very weak.  (-one) <br><br>  37) Increased coverage.  But compared to the test period, the signal quality has dropped dramatically.  (-five) <br><br>  38) +30 CINR - very good (+10) <br><br><h4>  Work speed </h4><br>  39) Above 2 megabits lately does not rise (-10) <br><br>  40) 1 mbps is a day and nice (Moscow) (+1) <br><br>  41) Wireless dialup + 2MB for 1-2 hours per day (-10) <br><br>  42) for surfing on the Internet - the rules, but online video is no longer possible to watch (+5) <br><br>  43) download by zero during working hours in the center of Moscow (-5) <br><br>  44) Compared with skylink, yota is a hundred times better!  (+5) <br><br>  45) A small reverse speed, which makes it impossible to organize high-quality IP telephony (-5) <br><br>  46) Over the last month in the center of Moscow fell by 5 times (-10) <br><br>  47) now 899 kbps.  If you work at 6000 kbps at least once, and such moments happened - for example, right after a 24-hour crash, then you spit on that speed.  WORK IS IMPOSSIBLE!  (-one) <br><br>  48) I see the base station from the window, but after August 21, the speed dropped several times.  pages loaded with difficulty.  (-ten) <br><br>  49) By edge on htc max 4g, the speed is sometimes higher (-10) <br><br>  50) With a SUPER signal, the speed is 10 kbps!  (-ten) <br><br>  51) Only after 4 nights barely 5 megabits (-5) <br><br>  52) bsid 00: 00: 15: 02: 13: c1 - April, May, June, July - speed 5-10 mb, August 1-4, September October no more than 1024 kbps and the farther away the worse the signal is no super speed :( (-ten) <br><br>  53) When testing everything was at 10 +. After activation, the speed of the low pages hang, load from 2 minutes with the signal quality "excellent".  (-ten) <br><br>  54) there is a signal, but nothing comes over it and it does not go away; the page can load for several minutes and not from the first attempt.  Something like a dial-up ... But in the south, in Brateevo, it works very fast for its signal ... Maybe I was lucky and they know little about YOTA.  (-five) <br><br>  55) Until September, everything was fine!  Now the Internet almost does not work and this is at the signal level at the OTL (VDNH, Cosmonauts 9)!  YOTA, put additional equipment and TP, otherwise customers will leave (-10) <br><br>  56) The speed of 178/99 kbit Khachaturian street Otradnoe 06.10.2009.  20-30 (-10) <br><br>  57) This, for example, page opened at a peak speed of 359 bits per second, a funny high-speed Internet (-10) <br><br>  58) 1.5 mbps is funny at full scale.  If the network is overloaded, then we need to think in advance and design with reserve, and not as always with us - first we build, and then traffic jams - and those who stand in them are to blame, but not those who built ... (-10) <br><br>  59) Files are downloaded relatively quickly, and the site can open for 1-2 minutes and then the second time.  (-one) <br><br>  60) The speed of work disappointed!  At night, great speed!  But in the afternoon, at the same signal level, you generally forget where you were, opening the page for 10 minutes!  This is very bad!  (-five) <br><br>  61) In some places, the speed stably keeps around zero with good signal quality.  In other places - it is decent.  (-five) <br><br><h4>  Technical support </h4><br>  62) Technical support is silent, or (mostly female) ‚Äúunexpectedly‚Äù throw up.  For all requests how to fix a problem with low speed there is a standard set of measures, no matter how much you say that it has been done more than once.  You hear nothing new.  The problem as it was, and remains.  (-ten) <br><br>  63) Not enough, they work quickly ... I used to wait about an hour for someone to pick up the phone ... (-1) <br><br>  64) It is impossible to call technical support, there is no direct connection with them, before getting into technical support, you must first try to solve the problem through the contact center and only after they cannot help you there, you will be switched to technical support and you will have to wait for the connection (listen to music ) from 30 minutes to 1.5 hours.  And in the contact center there are illiterate girls with standard ways to solve all problems: ‚Äúunplug the modem (or router) and reconnect‚Äù, ‚Äúrestart the computer‚Äù, ‚Äúwalk around the room with the router in search of a better signal‚Äù and similar nonsense.  (-ten) <br><br>  65) You have to wait for a response of 50 minutes, the support is not competent, all questions have one offer to reboot / reflash the device. Open requests after a month, close the problem without resolving the problem without notifying the client.  (-ten) <br><br>  66) Awesome uncles and aunts who do not even want to talk, especially in the days of interruptions.  (-ten) <br><br>  67) Everything is as it should be.  Helped really and quickly.  (+5) <br><br>  68) The response time to the application - a week or completely ignoring emails.  (-ten) <br><br>  69) after updating yota access, the pages stopped loading when the local network was connected (I repeat, after updating the software, everything was fine before that).  when asked if I could download a previous version of the program somewhere, they answered: no, you cannot, it has nothing to do with updating (?!), it can just work, and it can NOT work with other active connections.  the question, and where it is written, answered: in the instructions for the modem.  believed on the word, looked at both !!!  instructions - not a word about it (-10) <br><br>  70) and here are great!  addressed 2 times, both times helped quickly and clearly, although 2 times the question was very difficult ... non-standard for them ... (+5) <br><br><h4>  Tariff Policy </h4><br>  71) Well, I would like to certainly lower the rates, but the tariffs are good, they would still allow switching devices within one tariff (+5) <br><br>  72) unlimited, do not depend on the place, etc. for a fixed fee per month - it's great!  But the implementation is not very good ... (+10) <br><br>  73) Unlimited mobile for the price of wire.  Good.  (+10) <br><br>  74) iota day - for those who shake a lot but 1 day.  give something like ‚Äúiota byte‚Äù - for those who are often on the network, but surf by detslu, and do not fan from p2p (-1) <br><br>  75) After skylink it's just a freebie !!!  (+10) <br><br>  76) did not correspond to what was 10mb fluctuation was from 3mb-5mb once it was 10mb test from 17.07 to 10.10.09 and I couldn‚Äôt pay 900 rubles due to the speed mismatch (-1) <br><br>  77) It's good that no-limit, but not enough tariffs without a subscriber.  (+5) <br><br>  78) In the absence of wires, 900 rubles for unlimited Internet is a great alternative to other operators.  (+5) <br><br><h4>  Customer focus </h4><br>  79) Many of your potential customers (students, small firms) are not even aware of what Yota is.  There is no advertising in the subway cars, and the posters on the street are not very informative and just mislead people!  (-five) <br><br>  80) More likely on investors.  Beat off the headstock.  (-ten) <br><br>  81) I recently wrote a comment about the speed of work on the metro station Red Gate, which by September had fallen to 200kbit / 2kbit.  Last night I somehow got through to the technical support operator, said that the base station was overloaded and promised to supply additional equipment.  The next morning I turned on the computer and ofigel: the signal quality was 31 / -53 dB, measured the speed - 9 Mbit / 1.5 Mbit.  It turns out there are such miracles.  (+10) <br><br>  82) do not cope with their obyazonnasti.  the number of connected grows exponentially, and the number of towers is not ... hence all the problems (-5) <br><br>  83) Trying to help.  Polite  (+10) <br><br>  84) they really want to zabobastat market, advertising themselves everywhere, putting money into advertising, lose old customers because of the quality of the services provided, in particular speed.  (-one) <br><br>  85) Lose sooo many customers with such service!  (-one) <br><br>  86) To be honest, until you had to face it.  (+5) <br><br><h4>  Line of devices </h4><br>  87) Egg - Vesch, but explain why this device is only sold in two stores a month?  some kind of quarantine.  (-one) <br><br>  88) For his (+5) <br><br>  89) While I found a working modem, I messed up on two non-working ones!  Why did the batch of defective devices lay in a coherent and Euroset? .. (-5) <br><br>  90) Need a device with a connector for an external antenna.  (-five) <br><br>  91) I use SWC-E100.  There are no complaints, however, I can‚Äôt buy the declared PCMCIA adapter for Express-card ANYWHERE !!!  (-five) <br><br>  92) Thank you for the Egg!  Although it seems this hedgehog!  ) (+5) <br><br>  93) Not a single device with an official connector for an external antenna.  Stupid confidence or express restriction?  (-five) <br><br>  94) I would like a device with a removable antenna (+1) <br><br><h4>  Execution of obligations </h4><br>  95) You said 4G speed, tell me where yota works at maximum, my max speed was 5 when removing the laptop from the window (-10) <br><br>  96) Not suitable for corporate use 24/7.  After replacing the firmware with 3.106j and increasing the priority of the request at the base station, the speed of 1000-1500 kbps was somehow maintained until the accident.  After the accident, the speed dropped again 200-800 kbps.  Today, from 11 to 14 Yota practically did not work - the complete absence of requests for hosting Yota.  (-one) <br><br>  97) solve the problem with speeds, and there will be a better provider.  but with speeds everything is very sad. (((+1) <br><br>  98) I didn‚Äôt like the company to rewrite the agreement with which I agreed earlier when registering, but agreed afterwards!  clause 3.3 I think that the company really wants to provide everyone with a very good Internet, but the equipment is a technique!  There are flaws and lapses ... But personally, I believe in this company and wish it further successful development!  (+1) <br><br>  99) They can only promise, but things are still there (-10) <br><br>  100) Absolutely not fulfilling their obligations to transfer this speed is 20-30 times slower than stated.  (-ten) <br><br>  Latest comments are available via <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/YotaFeedbacks">RSS</a> . <br><br>  <b>October Custom Picture: Perplexity.</b> <br><br>  People are confused, falsely focusing on the statements "10 Mbit" and "high-speed Internet."  Regularly receiving in practice a modem access speed with a full signal, the user logically (in Russian) believes that he was ‚Äúfooled‚Äù. <br>  Constantly being on the one hand in a serious field of media pressure, and on the other in almost vacuum from standard answers from technical support, the user only becomes convinced of his suspicions. <br>  Pediatric growth disease will play a trick on Yota if you do not immediately start modifying the feedback formats.  People voting with a ruble are worthy to know about the technical work at the BS, about the overloaded areas and about the timeframe for normalizing the situation before any actions start.  Not 10, but 1-2 Mbit of stable work - would remove most of the claims and the general wave of user voltage. <br>  By the way, about some qualitative changes in October, representatives spoke in one of the radio interview ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/yota/blog/70357/">link to the announcement on Habr√©</a> ).  In October, this did not happen, look at November. <br><br>  Respectfully, <br>  I.V. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/74010/">https://habr.com/ru/post/74010/</a></p>
