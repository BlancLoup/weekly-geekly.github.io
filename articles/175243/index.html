Anyone who has tried Solo, at least once in a rage beat on the keyboard with his fist, and almost no one came to the end.  And who tried to stick the inscriptions on the keys, soon took the stickers back, because without skill and without signatures it is impossible to print, but somehow it is necessary to live on. <br><br>  What if I tell you that there is an absurdly simple, one-point way to learn to blindly print without these foolish restrictions? <br><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h2>  Training </h2><br>  Print and place a diagram next to the keyboard showing which finger to press which key.

    <br><h2>  The way </h2><br>  <b>Prevent yourself from pressing the keys with the wrong fingers</b> . <br><br>  Everything! <br><br>  You <b>do not need to</b> bring yourself to a nervous breakdown, again and again trying to print a hundred times without mistakes on the speed of a letter combination like ‚Äúololo lloloo‚Äù and phrases like ‚ÄúVladimir Vladimirovich Shakhidzhanyan is my mentor and teacher‚Äù. <br><br>  You <b>do not need</b> to specifically learn. <br><br>  You <b>can</b> look at the keyboard as you like. <br><br>  You <b>do not need to</b> spend time on exercise. <br><br>  Just start typing in this way everything that you have to type in your daily life and work - and after a while you will type blindly. <br><br><br><h2>  How and why does it work </h2><br>  All you need to learn blind typing is to learn to press the keys with the corresponding fingers.  When this skill is not yet fixed, you have a desire to poke your index fingers - so faster and more familiar.  As long as you allow yourself this, the skill to press with the right fingers will never be fixed. <br><br>  If you do not make exceptions and press each key with a strictly corresponding finger, the skill will be fixed by itself for a relatively short time.  This consolidation occurs at the level of motility, so memorization of the scheme is not required and most likely will not bring much benefit. <br><br>  Initially, the print speed will drop significantly.  There will be a painful desire to poke his index finger and, possibly, irritation.  Fight them and do not make exceptions. <br><br>  Depending on how much you print on a daily basis, it will take you from several days to several weeks to reach the previous printing speed, and then it will gradually increase. <br><br>  You will not immediately stop glancing at the keyboard, but this is not the main thing.  The main thing is that the skill will be fixed and the speed of recruitment will increase.  And the need to look at the keyboard over time will be less and less, until it disappears completely. <br><br><br><h2>  Choice of the scheme of correspondence between fingers and keys </h2><br>  All schemes on the Internet offer the following correspondence: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b5e/ca0/4d4/b5eca04d4b9f034c1e76d9cefe1ad306.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the same time, oddly enough, it is proposed to place the hands normally: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e02/529/e18/e02529e18b669d5693abf984ab63e765.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Obviously, such a scheme (and the asymmetrical keyboard itself with a shift of rows of keys) was invented by a person with a fracture of the left wrist. <br><br>  When I started typing, I quickly realized that putting my left little finger under the nameless one was unnatural and generally humiliating, so I chose the correspondence between the fingers and the keys as it was convenient for me: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1eb/98f/bb2/1eb98fbb281e9c740ec40ccd9f0a5b5c.png" alt="image"><br><br><br><h2>  Tips </h2><br>  Every time you start typing, feel with your index fingers for the risks on the F / A and J / O keys.  These risks are designed to help you put your fingers on the keyboard correctly, without looking at it. <br><br>  Position the keyboard so that the hands are on it symmetrically relative to your body, and not shifted to the left.  The center of the main part of the keyboard is between the G / P and H / P keys. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/34f/28f/f35/34f28ff35b9fdff782613bd302ec3eee.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Success story </h2><br><br>  It took me several months to print so that I could only look at the screen.  This, of course, is about the months of everyday life, not months of hard training. <br><br>  A few years later, <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/clusterm/" class="user_link">clusterm</a> gave me a <a href="http://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-ultimate-silent/">Das Keyboard Ultimate</a> keyboard for my birthday with the Cherry MX mechanics and no signatures on the keys.  This publication is written on it. <br><br>  PS The lack of signatures on the keys is, of course, bluff.  It makes an indelible impression on colleagues, but does not bring good, only inconvenience.  Is that now no one asks to use my computer.  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/175243/">https://habr.com/ru/post/175243/</a></p>
