    <h3>  How it was </h3><br>  The school was organized by the <a href="https://vk.com/gdgkazan">Google Developers Group Kazan</a> community and the <a href="http://www.e-legion.ru/">e-Legion</a> company with broad support <a href="http://kpfu.ru/itis">from ITIS KFU High School</a> . <br><br>  Unlike most of these schools, which are aimed primarily at beginners, our school has already been designed for developers with a certain experience.  But even we did not expect such popularity and response from all cities of Russia and even from other countries.  Therefore, the selection competition turned out to be very tough, and many worthy candidates could not get to school just because we could not train many people at once. <br><br>  After the completion of the selection, we realized that the average level of participants was much higher than expected, so we had to revise the school program.  This helped us create a complete and fairly detailed course on modern approaches in the architecture of client-server Android applications, which we hope will be useful to many developers. <br><br>  In total, 8 classes took place within the school, each started with a lecture of 60-80 minutes, after which the students performed practical tasks on the topic studied.  A number of small additional lectures at the request of students was also organized. <br><br>  A week before the end of the school, students broke up into teams of 3 people each and began to prepare final projects - applications.  In addition to directly writing the code, the projects included the preparation of the TOR, the splitting of tasks, code review and other business processes with which the students got acquainted during the course.  Even in conditions of limited time and abundance of tasks, the students coped perfectly well! <br><br>  We congratulate all the graduates of the school who were able to pass this difficult, but no doubt an interesting way to the end! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/420/89c/eff/42089ceff3634c5c9ee769296e198da7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Thanks </h3><br>  We thank all the developers who responded and submitted applications for participation in the School.  Thank you for your informational support and gifts to graduates of Google.  We also thank the High School ITIS KFU for help in organizing the educational process. <br><br><h3>  Materials </h3><br>  As promised, all materials are publicly available and are in a <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0B0Z-lYDZWlawR2VSbXF4UUltQ0U">folder</a> on Google Drive. <br><br>  All lectures can be downloaded as a single file in the above folder or separately from folders with the theme of each lesson.  All examples that contain practical tasks can be downloaded as archives for each lesson, or found on <a href="https://github.com/ArturVasilov/AndroidSchool">Github</a> . <br><br>  All course materials were developed by <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/arturka/">Artur Vasilov</a> .  They can be freely used / copied / translated into other languages ‚Äã‚Äãfor educational purposes and reports.  The use of any materials from the course in order to obtain commercial benefits is not allowed.  In addition, all documents are open for comment, so you always have the opportunity to recommend corrections or suggest improvements! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/310990/">https://habr.com/ru/post/310990/</a></p>
