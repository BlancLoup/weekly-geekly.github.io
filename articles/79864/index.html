Even the livestreet in the latest version has become uncommon.  And why is my engine worse?  Well, of course it has a lot in common with Habr, but it has its own.  Although, since the system of extensions appeared, everything has been singled out into separate extensions, but oh well.  I hasten to present you my blog-like social networking engine (c) <a href="http://envos.org/">Envos.Blogs</a> <br><br><img src="http://envos.org/images/photos/2745.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  But unlike other neklonov, I was not going to do something like Habr, and not Habr inspired me.  I was inspired by my friend, for a bottle of beer after a football workout.  He offered to write a site for our football team, so that people would come in and read announcements about new matches and training sessions, and could register.  I wrote, but nothing came of it.  People did not want to press the "come" button.  Then I wrote a photo gallery to upload photos from workouts.  Then he wrote blogs, that it would be possible to spread more reports.  Guestbook added for communication.  And so it fascinated me that I did not notice how the engine ala habr turned out. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So everything is fair, I did not copy Habr, I just wrote, but it turned out that.  By the way, this explains why not, for example statistics, why the rating system is weak, why the user profile is so terrible.  Would copy Habr, everything would be.  But I do not need all this for my tasks.  So later I will do karma and votes and even estimates for comments.

      After a while, of course, there appeared thoughts about how to raise money in this matter.  Well, damn, the work is done rather big, a bunch of code is written, the product is, after all, turned out.  In general, I tried to make a couple of projects on the engine, but apparently I didn‚Äôt get any SEO from me, I didn‚Äôt have much attendance, and since I do not have much free time, I still work, but what goes for my wife and the development of the engine, something I decided to unleash.  Left on the engine a couple of projects, but they are for the soul, I do not intend to earn them. <br><br>  So, the engine is based on its own MVC Framevork called Envos.  I am writing it for 5 years already, with large and small breaks.  Just do not scold me for the invention of the next bike.  When I started, there were no other normal products, and even Yii deserves attention now.  But he appeared quite recently (nevertheless, I already managed to draw some ideas from there), okay, this is not about Envos.  So, the engine is fully MVC, there is even ActiveRecord, validation, caching and other things.  There is scaffolding, and a bit of tests based on SimpleTest.  As always there is no main thing - documentation.  I say, time is short. <br><br>  In general, recently the engine develops very quickly.  Recently, a system of extensions has been developed, and, it seems to me, quite convenient and simple.  There are even dependencies; this is when one extension uses the capabilities of another, and this other does not exist, or it is not of the same version, or it is simply turned off, everything will work correctly (more precisely, it will not work correctly).  Or here's the theme system, with inheritance.  You can create a new design, with a bunch of templates, and many extension themes, with a minimum of wrappers and css, where only some templates will be overloaded, and the rest will be taken from the parent. <br><br>  There is also an installer that allows you to put the engine even full lamer.  There is an entrance on OpenID, there is a photo gallery, a guest book.  And there is something that no one has!  This, attention, football predictions module!  That is, it is a module that allows you to conduct contests of forecasters, for example, at the games of the championship of Russia on football.  You start tours, add matches to them, and users try to guess how the match will end. <br><br>  Still there is a module "Discussions".  The bottom line is that you can create a topic that you want to discuss, and invite people there.  The topic can be made open, closed and ridonly.  Accordingly, in the first case, everyone can read and write, in the second, only guests can read and write, and in the third case, everyone can read, and only guests can write.  But you can ask for an invitation from the author of the discussion, using a special button. <br><br>  There is in the engine and CNC, implemented by the type of what is in ZendFramework.  True, I don‚Äôt know why, but the code is less.  Although it works like not bad. <br><br>  The engine is able to check for the presence of a new version by itself, and be updated (this is no longer itself, you have to press a button).  In general, the update system is tricky.  She has a dual purpose.  Well, firstly it is a check for new versions and an update directly.  But that is not all.  I need the same script to keep statistics on engine installations.  At the same time, I take the RSS feed once a day.  Just in case, all of a sudden you have something interesting to write there;) But do not worry, you can turn off the check and then no data about you will be transmitted anywhere. <br><br>  And one more delicacy.  The engine can be installed 1 time in one directory, and then send different domains to it.  And for different domains will be your own website, with its own settings, and even the theme.  Only users will be shared.  Often, hosting has a limit on the number of sites.  You can not have domains sent to different directories more than what they should be.  With Envos.Blogs, the problem is solved easily. <br><br>  What is not?  A lot of things not.  Something just is not needed, something is in the form of a workable, but not in the way it was originally intended.  For example, "Discussions" are not tree-like.  It is also not possible to single out branches into separate discussions (there are no branches), or to arrange a vote on the admission of new participants, or the expulsion of those invited.  But all this was originally intended, and not inspired by Google Wave, as you might think.  But on the other hand, there is a lot of room for creativity for those who suddenly decide to help me, because almost every module can be improved.  Yes, and not looking at Habr.  Envos.Blogs same neklon.  Is not it?  :) <br><br>  Now about the plans.  Well, the nearest plans can be viewed <a href="http://code.google.com/p/envos-blogs/issues/list">in the Google.Code</a> project.  How quickly these plans will come true, I can not say, but, as I have already said, the project has been living, has been living for a year and a half, and so far there is enthusiasm.  And if on Habr√© my project will welcome, then it will only add incentive.  This type of hint;) <br><br>  Well, I hope this is not my last post about Envos.Blogs.  In the near future I will tell you how best to install the engine, how to update it, how to write modules to it.  Even if you do not need Envos.Blogs, it is likely that you will be interested in how it is made, maybe something useful will be for you, and probably something for me. <br><br>  Well, <b>Happy New Year to you!</b> <br><br>  <b>PS</b> And one more thing.  The engine should work on Windows, but I am not responsible for full performance.  For example, the installer will definitely not work, and the engine will be updated.  For photo galleries, you will need ImageMagik.  Envos has an abstraction mechanism from the OS, but it is not used everywhere.  Over time, platform-specific things will correspond, but I still don‚Äôt answer for Windu, I have no time to test it on it.  And for what, just to give the opportunity to play the engine locally?  Use Linux, in general :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79864/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79864/</a></p>
