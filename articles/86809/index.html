And in December, I thought about buying an additional netbook for the purposes of possible business trips and journeys. <br>  Initially, the choice fell on the Acer Aspire One Pro AOP531h-06k, the maximum performance model of the nebtuk of those that could be found on sale at the time (N270 1600 Mhz / 10.1 "/1024x600/2048Mb/250.0Gb) + up to 7 hours of work. <br><br>  In January, a trip to the capital was planned and it was decided at the same time to take a netbook there (with our city, the difference in price for this model was declared at a rate of 2-2.5 rubles).

      But immediately after the New Year holidays, a joyful newsletter came from a ‚Äúfriend-friend‚Äù who deals with laptops in Moscow, telling of the appearance of the first NVIDIA ION-based netbook in the warehouse - Asus EEE PC 1201N (Atom 330 1600 Mhz / 12.1 "/ 1366x768 / 2048Mb / 250.0Gb / no DVD / Wi-Fi / Bluetooth / Win 7 Starter). <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The declared price was 18,600, the colors are all existing - blue, black, silver and red. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/05b/b27/d40/05bb27d4012ceaddbcbac53750e72de1.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://s45.radikal.ru/i110/1003/3b/b7077d948f0e.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c82/0f7/de3/c820f7de368877dda9b694d7ab4a0eba.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://s58.radikal.ru/i162/1003/fe/8bfc3e75ff60.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Quickly looking at the descriptions of this device on the network, I realized that this is exactly what I need.  Having bought Acer, I could not completely abandon the existing Hewlett (TurionX2 TL-56 / 2048Mb / 160Gb / GeForce8400M) due to the lack of netbook performance.  The prospect of having 2 laptops with constant synchronization (and there is also a desktop) did not impress me.  In the case of buying a new Asus, Hewlett could safely sell. <br><br>  On the same day I contacted the man who had sent the news and put a reserve on the silver version. <br><br>  On the evening of the 17th, I was already working on it and was incredibly pleased with this purchase. <br><br>  Now, after almost two months, you can sell out on a small review. <br><br><h4>  so </h4><br><br><img src="http://s50.radikal.ru/i130/1003/a0/ae7b492ef320.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The standard package is a box, a laptop itself, a 6-cell battery, compact charging, a CD with software for Win 7, a guarantee. <br><br><img src="http://s004.radikal.ru/i205/1003/79/a02120beb510.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Cover without frills, with a modest Asus logo <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1ea/15e/aea/1ea15eaea2e1e2bb26da39bfbb99a8a4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The surface is completely glossy with the exception of the bottom, which in principle does not please (again, the rags are permanent), but already familiar, Hewlett was the same. <br><br><img src="http://s52.radikal.ru/i138/1003/51/8acc2511c7b0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The keyboard is almost full-sized, only naturally without a digital unit - the difference in width of the digital row from the desktop A4 to half the button.  Typing is extremely convenient (for other netbooks had to adapt. <br><br><img src="http://i076.radikal.ru/1003/31/d7ab99fa6964.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the photo it seems that the keyboard is convex - it does not seem like it is.  Suspicions of an unlatched fastening near F5, but have not yet understood - do not strain (the height difference is less than a millimeter) <br><br>  Between the buttons - a closed space, large debris will not fall. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2d1/3f4/0f1/2d13f40f12fa9a42e0cf107a83646a49.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The touchpad is simply in the form of a region of convex points, there is no difference in the surfaces, multitouch is present (gradually getting used to this innovation). <br><br><img src="http://i060.radikal.ru/1003/be/3f420ba3282d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the sides it looks like this - <br><br>  Left-hand side <br><img src="http://s004.radikal.ru/i206/1003/7b/871a3e54d81f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  front part <br><img src="http://i047.radikal.ru/1003/2f/c14fb52cd214.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Right side <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cda/9ef/e02/cda9efe02e7d8c0aca63ea72924b4e6c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Connectors as seen from the photo - charging, VGA, HDMI, 3USB, Ethernet, Headphones, Microphone, SD / MMC-Card <br><br>  On the connectors during operation revealed several shortcomings - <br>  USB ports with protruding iron frames - it is not always possible to get a USB flash drive or a cord into the blind - the plug clings to these frames. <br><br>  The power connector is very thin - it sometimes pops out of the socket if you hook on the cord or ‚Äúnot so‚Äù turn the netbook. <br>  Plus, there are also problems with getting into the blind - I often get into the cooling slots (it comes in by size, well, at least there is not enough) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8ff/8e3/8e0/8ff8e38e0689dff2c76b4fe5b3917e85.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Below is a little interesting.  There is a memory under the cover (2 bars of a manufacturer of little-known to me), it is impossible to get to the rest without parsing. <br><br><img src="http://i025.radikal.ru/1003/d0/2e35444256fa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The battery as already mentioned on 6 cells, but not very strong <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/289/437/92a/28943792ac48c85ae3829d994d18ae1f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The 180 screen does not open, but the hindrance is not the battery, but the design of the hinges. <br><br>  It is assembled as a whole soundly, there are no backlash squeaks except for a small misunderstanding with one keyboard latch, but these are trifles. <br><br><h4>  Work and performance </h4><br><br>  Full stated characteristics such - <br>  Atom 330 processor 1600 MHz (2 cores + hipertaring, the system sees 4 CPUs <br>  533 MHz system bus frequency <br>  Memory 2048 MB DDR2 <br>  250 GB hard drive <br>  Weight 1.46 kg <br>  Display 12.1 inches, 1366x768, widescreen <br>  LED backlight screen <br>  Type of graphics controller built-in <br>  NVIDIA ION Graphics Chipset <br>  Battery work time up to 5 h, Li-Ion <br><br>  The pre-installed Win 7 Starter OS - lived exactly a couple of hours.  It was replaced by a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù version immediately after it was unable to pick up an external screw (it constantly clicked like with a lack of power, although it was connected via a double cable). <br><br>  First I put 64-bit - it went up and everything worked except for incomprehensible problems with Wi-Fi.  Firewood is, the device is working, but does not see the points.  For half a day, the problem could not be solved in various ways and therefore I replaced it with 32 bits, after which the questions disappeared - the system works without complaints even now. <br><br>  The performance of the apparatus for my tasks is excellent enough. <br>  Casper, 2 bales, Skype, onenot, groove, Denver, a lot of windows of the opera, explorer, dreamview, photoshop, outluk, fubar, norton and other trifles are constantly running.  I do not feel any differences in comfort from a hulet. <br><br>  A huge plus is the ability to watch a 1080 video that the hylet with its GF8400M did not pull at all. <br><br>  Wi-Fi is normal (saw 12 points where others are from 8 to 14), Bluetooth works (phone and mouse hang at the same time).  I have not tried to output the signal to HDMI, I connect either monitors or projectors on VGA. <br><br>  Without a load, it does not make much noise at all and does not heat up - it is a little warm under the left hand. <br><br>  On the disk in the kit, as I said, there is a set of drivers for Win 7 plus a collection of software for it.  From the software, only the utility for changing the performance / power consumption modes and for backups via the Internet was remembered.  When registering for free, 500Gb of space is allocated on Asus servers under the file storage. <br><br>  System Performance Evaluation - <br>  Processor - 3.2 <br>  Memory - 4.5 <br>  Graphics - 4.2 <br>  Graphics for games - 5.3 <br>  Primary hard drive - 5.8 <br><br>  3dmark06 showed 1511 points (I don‚Äôt know how much it‚Äôs a lot or a little, I‚Äôve just tested it for nothing). <br><br>  In games I did not test - I'm absolutely not a player. <br><br>  12.1 "1366x768 screen for work is fine enough, it looks like a Word <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/044/d23/f6b/044d23f6b387dd1bc94fba4a3b13fc21.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  opera <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8a6/faf/b25/8a6fafb259b090c9cf1c4fceb1a03ab1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  and dream <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3b7/e77/fd1/3b7e77fd1b61337aba1feab82589030b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br><br>  In total, I moved from a full <s>valuable</s> spring two-year-old laptop to a brand new netbook. <br><br>  I didn‚Äôt lose the performance, and in some places I even won (video, hard drive).  The old laptop after buying a netbook included only 3 times, the first time to merge all the files, the second time to clean before selling and the third when showed the new owner. <br><br>  Visibly won in compactness - 12.1 "against 15.1", very much in weight 1.4kg vs. 2.8kg, strongly in work duration - 4.5 hours versus 2 hours. <br><br>  The only thing I lost was that the hyulet in the kit had an IR remote for the player and presentations, sometimes it was very helpful, but this is treated by buying a normally presenter. <br><br>  This upgrade cost me 3,600 rubles, the hulet was sold on the third day after submitting the ad for 15,000, which I consider to be a very profitable acquisition. <br><br>  Judging by the Yandex market, there is now a huge demand for these models, which greatly exceeds the capacity of the stores, in our city it has never appeared in any store (friends caught fire after what I saw). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86809/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86809/</a></p>
