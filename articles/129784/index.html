  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Electronic medical records - is it necessary?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After reading <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/e_gov/129429/">this</a> post, there was a desire to share the experience of developing and implementing a program to automate a polyclinic.  The program was developed on the basis of Polyclinic No. 7 of the city of Cherepovets and, accordingly, satisfies the wishes of the doctors as much as possible.  However, every different accounting of everything she also produces, up to the last pill. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At once I will make a reservation that the product is not an independent program, but only a configuration on the 1C platform.  But, nevertheless, it performs its functions. <br><br><h5>  What got from this clinic </h5><br>  Firstly, the efficiency of obtaining virtually any statistical information, including who, when, from whom and why.  As a result, even the most unexpected monitoring of various levels of subordination does not stump. <br>  Secondly, the relevance of paper cards has disappeared, since all information is stored in the database and any cards can be printed from the first visit to the last. <br><br><h5>  What did the doctors get from it? </h5><br>  Almost complete lack of a pile of papers, no magazines and reports that need to be filled constantly.  Everything is formed from the base. <br>  Again, the efficiency of obtaining information.  All the departments of the polyclinic are connected to the program, including the laboratory, vaccination and procedural, and as soon as the patient submits the analysis, the result immediately appears in his electronic map. <br>  But the most important thing is the input of information.  All data entered into the reception of the patient is formalized, and are selected from various lists.  Data about the patient is entered once when it is first treated, and then only corrected if necessary.  Moreover, since the clinic basically provides services under the OMS program, patient data is entered automatically from the database of the insured by the number of the policy.  Accordingly, typos and errors during data entry are practically non-existent. <br>  All paper documents, such as recipes, certificates, etc., are printed from the program and doctors do not need to enter this pile of incomprehensible digits in the forms. <br>  And if you remember the new form of a disability sheet ... I can not say that our doctors did not even notice it, but the transition to new forms for them was not so painful as for other clinics.

    <h5>  What patients got from this </h5><br>  Has the rate of patient care increased?  Yes and no.  Those who are in a hurry forever, of course, are served much faster, but there is also time to talk with grandmother.  And precisely by reducing the time to fill in various forms. <br>  The amount of paperwork was minimized.  Ideally, if a patient is examined in our clinic, to all specialists, to the laboratory and to all examinations, he walks only with his own medical insurance policy.  All information necessary for the doctor is in the database. <br>  We went a little further along the path of convenience for patients.  An information kiosk is connected to the program, which allows you not only to get the results of your examinations, but also to sign up for a doctor and call the doctor at home.  However, our patients can make a call to the doctor at home, even from the clinic site. <br>  Separately, you need to say about the appointment.  Getting to the doctor in any clinic is always a problem.  There is practically no such problem in our clinic.  A specialist can write to any doctor at any time.  All entries fall into the common database.  In the reception, more than 3 people are already considered a queue.  I do not argue, there are situations when it is difficult to make an appointment with a doctor, for example, during the holidays.  But in this case, the patient is simply put in an electronic queue and quietly at home waiting for the call.  The program itself will provide him a ticket.  The maximum waiting time is no more than 2 weeks. <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  Everything looks just great.  But there is one "BUT".  All inspection organizations, starting with insurance companies and ending with the FSS, trust only a piece of paper.  The result is that with one hand they are trying to introduce e-government, and with the other they are killing everyone. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129784/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129784/</a></p>
