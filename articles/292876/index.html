      At its very core, mobile programmatic advertising includes the automation of buying and selling digital advertising inside advertising exchanges and inventory.  Nevertheless, there are many variations of this basic concept, allowing market participants to have a high level of customization, depending on their approach to mobile programmatic advertising. <br><br>  First, you need to understand how important this technology is for web advertising.  The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) shows that <a href="http://www.iab.net/programmaticwhitepaper">85% of advertisers and 72% of publishers</a> are actively using programmatic advertising, and these numbers will continue to grow.  eMarketer claims that in <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article/US-Programmatic-Ad-Spend-Tops-10-Billion-This-Year-Double-by-2016/1011312">2014, mobile programmatic advertising</a> was ripening, there was an explosive growth of this marketing technology.  It is expected that the mobile programmatic will be the driving force behind the entire increase in costs for the automatic purchase of advertising.  <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-programmatic-ad-report-2014-7%3FIR%3DT">According to forecasts</a> , by 2018 the cost of mobile and video programmatic will amount to 3.9 billion dollars.  USA. <br><br>  There are various forms of mobile programmatic aimed at different markets.  These different markets use different technologies and practices that depend primarily on the type of advertising that you buy or sell. <br><br>  <b>Real-time Bidding (RTB)</b> is the most popular and widely used form of mobile programmatic, and it has already established itself in the industry. <br><br>  Advertisers work through advertising exchanges and <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/byyd/blog/17496/">DSP.</a>  This gives them the opportunity to choose a site for placing their advertising among the huge advertising equipment provided by publishers.  This inventory has the form of impressions available to the advertiser, the purchase of which he carries out according to the auction scheme in real time. <br><br>  The RTB format is an open platform where advertisers have the opportunity to buy only the shows they need, at the price that suits them.  Most of these impressions are based on reliable data on the type of target audience, including demographic information, preferences, type of mobile device, and other key factors. <br><br>  RTB does not establish a uniform format of the exchange environment, there are also other exchange intermediaries.  Open exchange platforms are available for all Advertisers, but there are also private, closed RTBs that offer various types of exclusive advertising inventory. <br><br>  Another popular option is Direct <b>Direct Programmatic</b> , also known as Guaranteed Program Programmatic, which sells advertising at a fixed rate.  This is a more exclusive market than the typical RTB.  Direct programmatic allows Publishers to sell their advertising platforms to a wide range of customers, including advertisers and agencies, at a fixed rate.  It may include the option of work by invitation, in which the Publisher selects certain buyers of advertising impressions who are entitled to purchase the most valuable and sought-after advertising sites.  This type of mobile programmatic allows publishers and advertisers to comply with the terms of the transaction, based on a unique ID, which serves as a guarantor of what specific inventory advertising will be displayed on. <br><br>  <b>Key features and benefits of Mobile Programmatic</b> <br><br>  Mobile programmatic provides an opportunity to optimize your digital advertising and improve targeting.  Advertisers can set the purchase price, what kind of audience they want to reach, and in what area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Web they want their ads to be shown - all this provides ample opportunities for customization. <br><br>  The key advantage of mobile programmatic advertising is the <b>data</b> , and the ability to use this data to reduce the cost per thousand impressions (CPM), and increase clickability (CTR).  Often, mobile programmatic buyers have access to the choice of advertising platform, categorized by different types, including information about the mobile device, installed applications, operating system versions, and the size of the available advertising format (such as 320 * 50, 300 * 250, etc.) ).  Advertising can then be divided by mobile device models, screen sizes and Internet connection speed, as well as other factors.  In addition, there are various options to embed an advertisement through JavaScript or MRAID SDK. <br><br>  And most importantly, mobile programmatic allows advertisers to better understand users through behavioral patterns, such as: <br><br><ul><li>  geolocation data </li><li>  data on user habits, for example, which stores, restaurants, tourist destinations they prefer </li><li>  tracking of activity in mobile applications and use of the phone by the user </li><li>  user activity in different social networks, and display ads based on this data </li><li>  The use of mobile identifiers that allow you to better configure retargeting makes it possible for advertisers to build a long-term brand development strategy and improve their impression </li></ul><br><br>  Mobile programmatic, ultimately, allows you to use your creative potential at full power.  With this technology, you know that your advertising will reach the target audience through precise targeting.  This allows you to focus all your efforts on creativity, and not on finding a specific group of people who will be interested in your products.  For example, a video format is an excellent tool that can ‚Äúcapture‚Äù an audience.  Although it is expensive, the data obtained with the help of a mobile programmatic allow such more expensive advertising to reach a wide, but at the same time specific, audience, helping to improve the performance indicators of your advertising campaign. <br><br>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/byyd/blog/17850/"><b>To be continued‚Ä¶</b></a> <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292876/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292876/</a></p>
