  <section class="page js-page"><h1>10 names</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today it is not enough to come to the market with innovative technology.  ‚ÄúAs you call a ship, so it will float‚Äù is a phrase known to all from childhood.  Perhaps this is why large companies are so careful in choosing a name for their products, because you have to take into account a huge number of factors: sound, writing, adequacy of perception by the global audience, copyright issues, in the end.  Today I will talk about how 10 world-famous trademarks got their names and what some of them mean.  Something will be intriguing, surprising, and something - quite predictable, please do not judge strictly. <br><br><h4>  Red Hat Linux: a name with a rich undertone </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/772/6eb/940/7726eb94063e5a97f8a09c69e657ab30.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  Co-founder Bob Young (Bob Young, in the image) <a href="http://www.redhat.com/magazine/002dec04/features/name/">gave several explanations for the</a> appearance of the ‚Äúred hat‚Äù: 1. Red Hat got its name in honor of the red color, in the history of the West, which is a symbol of liberation and the struggle for power.  2. The second co-founder, Marc Ewing, wore his grandfather's red lacrosse hat in college and was known for his approach to solving technical problems and his experience in handling equipment.  Everyone who had any questions and problems, went to the guy "in the red hat."  3. Ewing called his first software projects Red Hat 1, Red Hat 2, and so on.  Therefore, when the Linux project appeared, it was simply called Red Hat Linux.  Things went well :) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Mac OS X and Big Cats </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ae0/90e/0ab/ae090e0ab38f9c4e00ae4f9cb493b09a.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  The well-known operating system, one of the most popular products of Apple, received the letter "X", obviously, as the Latin "10".  The reason is clear - it was the tenth release of the OS.  Unfortunately for many Apple fans, most people still read the figure as ‚ÄúX‚Äù, which has become popular in our time (X-men, X-time, etc.).  Much more interesting is the chronology of the ‚Äúbig cats‚Äù in the release titles - the first was a cheetah (cheetah, 10.0), then a puma, a jaguar, a panther, a tiger, and finally a ‚Äúlittle leopard‚Äù - the current version.  The Snow Leopard (10.6) has already been announced and there are rumors that a lynx (lynx) and a cougar (cougar) are next in line. <br><br><h4>  Wikipedia - we write what we hear </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/304/338/526/304338526d544ae959dc0c4a18c20566.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  According <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia">to Wikipedia itself</a> , she received the name as a result of language contamination (in a simple way it is called "compound words") from the words "Wiki", technologies for creating collaborative (UGC) websites, and "encyclopedia" - thick books, of which while studying, everyone shamelessly copied notes.  Today, instead of encyclopedias, children and adults shamelessly plagiarize Wikipedia itself.

    <h4>  Android - with a hidden, but not fantastic, meaning </h4><br>  The name of the consortium initiated by Google - Open Handset Alliance gives a direct reference to the "open strategy" and "free software."  However, few people know that the Android trademark was acquired by Google back in 2005, and all the work until 2008 was carried out under a veil of secrecy.  <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/aug2005/tc20050817_0949_tc024.htm">All that was known was</a> that this company was engaged in ‚Äúdeveloping software for mobile phones,‚Äù while Google made it not just a recognizable trademark, but also a great name for all Android phones on board.  "- What do you have?  -Android.  ‚ÄúOh, I see,‚Äù - I myself have often witnessed such a dialogue. <br><br><h4>  ThinkPad - simplicity wins </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/810/db9/37c/810db937cc290c46f3e89304ef9e49be.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  The famous line of IBM laptops was introduced in 1992 already far.  Despite the fact that the first concept, ready to be announced to the general public, was already ready, there were serious disputes within the company about what to call the laptop.  <a href="http://thinkpads.com/Genesis3.htm">IBM was striving for simplicity</a> and, by universal advice, the name ThinkPad was chosen by the majority.  However, the highest corporate ranks did not appreciate the name, because each IBM product should have been marked with numbers.  In addition, there was an adequate question: how will the ThinkPad translate into other languages?  But thanks to the perseverance of the IBM employee who designed the first ThinkPad, the laptop was named that way.  Prior to the sale of this part of Lenovo's business in 2005, but even after that, the tradition of the ThinkPad has been preserved. <br><br><h4>  Windows 7 - magic number in action </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/31e/282/2ee/31e2822ee1a6361121c73ef70e75d4bf.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  While Microsoft‚Äôs next operating system is rumored to have another unobvious name, Windows 7 seems to be winning its love among regular users.  But it is worth looking back a bit and remember the previous versions of this popular OS: Vista?  This name will soon become synonymous with not the most pleasant adjectives.  Windows 95?  One could ask a reasonable question - is there no imagination in Redmond?  Windows xp  Hardly anything better.  Mike Nash <a href="http://windowsteamblog.com/blogs/windowsvista/archive/2008/10/13/introducing-windows-7.aspx">announced Windows 7 with the</a> following words: "This is the seventh release of Windows, and therefore Windows 7 has a clear meaning."  Obviously?  Full  In addition, now there is a reason to rely on the power of the magical seven, perhaps it will bring Microsoft more than one million "good luck". <br><br><h4>  Twitter - digital chirping </h4><br><img src="http://beerandnosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/twitter_fail_whale_01.png" alt="image" align="left">  When Twitter co-founder, Biz Stone saw the application that Jack Dorsey created in 2006, they <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi%3Ff%3D/c/a/2007/03/19/BUG31OM9RN18.DTL">both thought about how</a> birds interact with each other: ‚ÄúShort blasts of information - we all heard the chirping of birds.  They make gorgeous twitter in short passages, and when there are a lot of them, this noise cannot be stopped and, most importantly, there is not a single person who would be totally against the noise and noise of bird singing. ‚Äù  Then the word ‚Äútwttr‚Äù came to Stone‚Äôs head, and after that the rest of the team came up with the vowels.  Now it is difficult to underestimate the fact that Twitter was made with the world of technology and information, but initially it was just a trivial chirping. <br><br><h4>  Firefox: everything is simple - we like it </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0ba/b2d/0cd/0bab2d0cd68b72e1e5e8965bffd79436.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  Choosing a name for the product, which remains in memory for a long time and, importantly, is still available, a large company of employees gathered in Mozilla.  The original version was the name ‚ÄúFirebird‚Äù (which refers us not only to the ‚Äúfiery bird‚Äù, but also the insanely popular car in the USA), but due to another open source project with the same name, this option had to be dismissed.  Firefox, the red panda, came to mind a little later.  Why?  ‚ÄúIt's easy to remember.  That sounds good.  This is unique.  <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/firefox-name-faq.html">We like it</a> . ‚Äù  And what's the best?  This is a completely unique name - no one has ever used this name before Mozilla. <br><br><h4>  BlackBerry - sweet addiction </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ccb/122/9a7/ccb1229a7992f2f0993b2b0dd6a79667.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  Canadian company Research In Motion turned to the well-known office of Lexicon Branding with a request for assistance in creating and selecting a name for a wireless e-mail reader in 2001.  It was in Lexicon <a href="http://www.canada.com/topics/technology/story.html%3Fid%3D85473082-02e8-4296-80a8-d8bdd4901496">that they advised not to dwell</a> on the ‚Äúe-mail‚Äù, as judging by research, this word raises blood pressure (corporate nerves) in many people.  In return, the guys thought about a word that awakens joy, good mood and a sense of peace.  When someone suggested that the small buttons on the device looked like seeds of berries, Lexicon Branding began to put words from the names of berries such as watermelon, strawberry, and many others.  Having abandoned the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing an existing name, the device was simply called ‚Äúblack berry‚Äù, so far, all BlackBerry devices by default are of exactly that color. <br><br><h4>  iPod - detachable compartment </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7c8/f5c/ff1/7c8f5cff18886fbecb97024cd8de2a31.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  During the development of the MP3 player at Apple, Steve Jobs talked a lot about the company's strategy: ‚ÄúMac is a hub for all other gadgets.‚Äù  Winnie Chico (Vinnie Chieco), freelance copywriter, who was hired to help with the name for the new device, was <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/commentary/cultofmac/2006/10/71956">repelled by this thought</a> in the process of brainstorming.  It was then that an analogy with the space station occurred to him - you can leave it in a detachable spacecraft, but you will have to return for refueling.  It was then, in 2001, that he made the final decision: pod.  Well, at Apple, by that time, they had the habit of adding an ‚Äúi‚Äù to everything.  What happened next now even the children know. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/63002/">https://habr.com/ru/post/63002/</a></p>
