Everything is good, but not compact - you won't drag such a brick with you.  In the meantime, the need to carry a bunch of files with me did not go away - all of a sudden for myself, I switched to a portable hard disk, because  place on the flash drive was just not enough.  In <a href="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/contest/item/828/">some kind of</a> competition, he won a 500GB <b>Seagate FreeAgent Go</b> , in which there is almost no free space left, which is why he found peace on a backup shelf. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0da/1ec/6bc/0da1ec6bc6e737c7a18675cabef0338f.jpg" alt="image">

      It was replaced by a new hard drive, which you can carry with you and not be afraid that it will be scratched - this is <b><a href="http://www.verbatim.ru/ru_19/product_surefire-portable-hard-drive-320gb_17741.html">Verbatim SureFire</a></b> .  Why did I choose him?  There are several reasons for this: the previous devices of the company (a USB flash drive and the disk mentioned above) have worked well;  bribed the practical properties of the device;  it is quite rare - at least it was interesting how it is better or worse than other disks that I don‚Äôt even want to write about (almost everyone has the same agent). <br><br><h2>  Inbox </h2><br>  A small box, inside which everything is in order: <br><br>  - 320GB Verbatim SureFire hard drive. <br>  - Two USB cables (for connection and for power); <br>  - Cable FireWire 800-400; <br>  - Cable FireWire 800-800; <br>  - User's manual; <br>  - Protective case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f65/6bc/e38/f656bce381047e6d0a6b22148da1f5ce.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  All connectors are located at one end of the drive - miniUSB (2.0), FireWire 800, and a USB power connector.  The latter is needed in case a single USB port for powering the drive is small (USB power cable is included), which is rare, but it occurs.  So the pluses of the IEEE 1394 bus include full power supply of the device - the specification says about 1.5A and voltage from 8 to 40 volts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9b1/e2a/dbf/9b1e2adbfb429c808c2b45ae46417e42.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Unlike the ‚Äúsoft‚Äù coating of FreeAgent (which is almost scratched with a fingernail), the SureFire case is more practical - it is made mostly of brushed aluminum (no prints remain) and only small inserts (also dull) of plastic are on the ends.  And the case, it seems, is part of the heat exchange system of the device - I cannot explain any other strong heating of luminescence (with active work).  Above is a dim LED, and below - 4 rubber feet, which are almost completely extinguish the already insignificant parasitic vibrations.  The dimensions of the device are the most typical - 81x128x15 (mm) with a weight of 186 grams. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/11a/ec2/086/11aec2086f7b3e0f3fbb88db21af9daf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2e9/98e/4f2/2e998e4f256784d05c12ef9f85515c34.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Inside the armor sharpened 2.5 "hard disk, the working capacity of which - 298GB.  The cache is 8MB, the model is unknown (I did not understand it, and the system is simply Ext Ext Hard Disk), but judging by the firmware version, Samsung. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ed/128/9f7/1ed1289f7663ce44d3d785cd99a73f47.jpg" alt="."><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4b0/2f6/563/4b02f65632540e724614b9d2c867836f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  High-speed measurements in the program <b>HD Tune Pro</b> . <br><br><h2>  USB 2.0 </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/89d/d53/c53/89dd53c5336f1f83cb55065fb54ed524.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9a3/bb0/dc2/9a3bb0dc24e0321d424a22620800b15d.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Firewire 400 </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c0c/99f/59b/c0c99f59be8510eba5b3391e5a94609b.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ff1/2cc/49c/ff12cc49c5aef7de0410fd577cd18752.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Despite theoretically 480 Mbit / s in USB2.0 versus 400 Mbit / s in FireWire 400, the latter wins in practice, and with a good margin - in daily use it will be only a plus.  Unfortunately, I couldn‚Äôt do the most interesting thing because of the absence of a FireWire 800 (1394b) connector on my computer.  I suspect that in this case the speed would be even higher - in the region of 50 Mb / s. <br><br>  During idle, the disk temperature was about 40 degrees, with active work - all 50. Within the limits of acceptable, but, of course, high. <br><br>  By the way, this is the first 2.5 ‚Äùdisk (which I met), which supports <b>AAM</b> (Automatic Acoustic Management) technology, about which I once wrote a small <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/71436/">note</a> .  Trifle, but nice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/105/c09/387/105c093877ebb7fa990fffed473e2b9f.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8ff/3b9/7ab/8ff3b97abda231716be2b789146ec6a1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Protective cover from the kit - a separate spoon of honey.  It does not need to constantly open and close - the hard drive is simply inserted inside.  But to scratch the device "in the peel" will be much more difficult.  The only thing that is not provided in the design is a clip or slot for fastening on a belt.  On the other hand, wearing a hard drive on a belt ... but what if someone wears in his pockets. <br><br>  When you first run on the disk, you can find 29 instruction files in different languages ‚Äã‚Äã(including Russian). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e31/abb/2e5/e31abb2e5e8c300c6d2476b420bea3a8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Another bonus is that initially HFS + plays the role of the file system on the disk, which makes the disk suitable for use in MacOS, including Time Machine. <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  By the way, various companies are promoting the IEEE 1394 standard under their own trademarks: <br><br>  Apple - <b>FireWire</b> <br>  Sony - <b>i.LINK</b> <br>  Yamaha - <b>mLAN</b> <br>  TI - <b>Lynx</b> <br>  Creative - <b>SB1394</b> <br></td></tr></tbody></table><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9f4/39b/5e9/9f439b5e996bc2469435a841d5d28b46.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Case included; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Rubber feet against vibration; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Ability to work on USB and FireWire; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Durable metal (matte) case; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Initially compatible with Time Machine;  AAM support; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  There is no software on the disc *; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  It is heated enough when working; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  The price is slightly higher than other drives. <br><br>  * Apparently there is no software on the disk because the disk is more oriented towards users of Apple-systems, i.e.  where Time Machine is installed initially.  But ... after all, the disc works great in Windows-systems ...) <br><br>  In nature, there are three versions of the drive - 250, 320 and 500 GB.  They cost 3200, 4000 and 5200 rubles, respectively. <br><br><h2>  The end </h2><br>  Undoubtedly, the leader in prevalence for such devices is the USB interface.  Everyone is good and comfortable, but not as fast as we would like - however, the new version (3.0) is already slowly hitting the stores.  In the meantime, the time for new technologies has not finally come, you can use the good old FireWire. <br><br><img src="http://wimaxtoday.ru/boomburum/IMGP9464.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The drive from Verbatim left only positive impressions - such a device will suit any user, but, as I said, it is somewhat more expensive.  Therefore, it makes sense to overpay only in three cases - if there is a FireWire-support / need or if you need a practical package.  Actually, it is these two things that distinguish the SureFire from the hordes of other devices of this class ... otherwise, this is just another hard disk, even if it is really good.  The month has passed - the flight is normal. <br><br>  Do not forget that all people are divided into those who make backups and those who MORE do not. <br>  During the test, no byte was hurt. <br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/91551/">https://habr.com/ru/post/91551/</a></p>
