The main difference, which we took from the very beginning, was of course free, then there was the first (again, free) ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù application, and now quite a lot of functionality that has overtaken some paid systems. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Monitoring on your site. </h4><br><br>  Now everyone who is somehow connected with the monitoring of objects (either sellers of equipment, or individuals, or organizers of ‚Äúpatrols‚Äù and other active sports) can provide monitoring services from their website.  To do this, you need to insert a PHP script, create a login form for your style, and most importantly, choose the color gamut of the visual range itself, so that it fits the overall look of the site as much as possible.  Only about 20 color variations. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/ed31f74f/2e3f5192/c1a87893/9654d523.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Changing work with objects. </h4><br>  We have expanded the functionality of working with objects on the map.  Now it is a separate unit that can be assigned icons (a set of icons, we will soon make a custom load), assign phone numbers, different descriptions, use either a geocoder or use pens to determine the location.  When you hover on it - info pops up about the object.  A filter for ignoring fuel drains is also present - winter is coming soon and the diesel will be jumping at night, putting a daw on can be removed by paranoia that someone is draining fuel.  It is also the last step to public transport on the web (stops will be marked this way).

The task came from field workers - binding to a specific field of a tractor or a group of tractors - shows both the implementation and the time of work on a specific field.  Agriculture is a very numerical customer, as it turned out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/013c1d21/6bd5beca/5ef7f7df/87053971.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Change work with devices. </h4><br><br>  At the very beginning, the service was conceived exclusively for GPS vehicle monitoring, and the usual directional arrow was quite enough.  By order of active users - now on the map objects can be displayed either in a standard form (an arrow with a direction of movement), or in the form of painted cars, little people and other joy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/9590e0d3/e9788a93/12f634d3/14874ff1.jpg"><br>  Another important innovation is the beginning of support for flow sensors of fuel consumption produced by VZO, and Technoton (for counting direct fuel injection and return flow, which goes back to the tank).  While the function is being tested, it is already available for binding to the car and receiving graphic data for analysis. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/b500127d/610b5361/efb546e7/6741837a.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Made a password recovery button. </h4><br>  The right thing, all hands did not reach - now everything works.  Mailer regularly sends letters with password reset lines.  No comments. <br><br><h4>  Cdma android </h4><br>  Because  none of us have ever used CDMA phones, it was a great surprise for us that they had IMEI phones with letters and numbers and, accordingly, fought off our service like broken packages.  Now all the rules - also available in the service a number of devices that have the same formats IMEI codes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/131/46c/0b2/13146c0b2cc2b9e03b43887f7a93afc0.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Opera - supported </h4><br>  Somehow we received a letter with the following content: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/e9c7e676/bc94b2d6/3e9ce27c/ae3998a7.jpg"><br><br>  We heeded the advice in this letter - and made support for the Opera.  More "a single gap !!!!". <br><br><h4>  And‚Ä¶ </h4><br>  Corrected everything that users indicated after the article, slightly changed the design of both the tracker and the site itself (again, thanks a lot to those who gave practical advice). <br>  What's next? <br>  We continue to work on the project, adding new features and testing the old ones, the project is alive and developing extremely quickly.  Special thanks to those who from the very beginning are with us and will be grateful and grateful for constructive criticism and suggestions for optimizing and developing the resource.  Create your monitoring with us! <br><br>  <b>Ps</b> .
