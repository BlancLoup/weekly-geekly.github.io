Since everything that could be written about the program and the main novelties is already written ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/jugru/blog/450890/">hello</a> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/phillennium/" class="user_link">phillennium</a> ), then what remains for the humble visitor?  Just tell <i>all that is hidden, expose the dark corners</i> and understand what is happening in sunny California these three days a year. <br><br>  It so happened that I was at the previous conference and even wrote <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/wrike/blog/358392/">an article</a> about it.  Therefore, on the one hand, the task becomes more complicated, because no one wants to read the same thing two times, and on the other, it becomes more complicated.  I would not like to turn the text into a report in the spirit of: ‚Äúincrease in visitors: + 20%, milk yield fell by 3%, the mood of the personnel is good‚Äù, so let's agree: you will have an artistic description of personal experience and some objective information. <br><br>  <sub><b>Attention,</b> <i>this is not a detailed analysis of the program, but a kind of virtual tour of the conference.</i></sub>  <sub><i>Nobody likes deceived expectations, right?</i></sub>  <sub><i>All reports are on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleDevelopers">YouTube</a></i></sub>

This is still not the easiest task.  But not impossible.  Just need just a little more.  A little more money on the plane and accommodation, a little more time to wait for the tickets, a little more luck.  Here I am not an adviser to you.  Suppose that anyway, there are plane tickets, there is a place to live (and not even under the bridge), the coveted QR code waits for its day in the mail. <br>  But what I personally didn‚Äôt take with me or didn‚Äôt take is enough - this is patience. <br><br>  If someone tells me that in America there is a problem with unemployment, I will laugh in his face.  Yes, millions are starving, homeless people on the streets of San Francisco are begging (with an iPhone in their pockets), but at the airport‚Äôs passport control we will deliver only two employees.  After all, the queue - this is what you want after a 12-hour flight.  Well, seriously, I, of course, had a grudge, but to stand for another two hours due to the fact that it is impossible to add more officers - this is somehow too much.  Although it may, in this way, cut off the terrorists - they simply die of boredom, without stepping on American soil. <br><br>  In short, I advise everyone to fly through <b>San Jose</b> or <b>Oakland</b> .  All this is considered to be the Bay Area, the second, but on the other side of the bay, but from it you can also get to your next stop.  And this is most likely: <br><br><h3>  Housing </h3><br>  As the classic said: "The housing problem has spoiled people."  Progressive countries have deteriorated earlier, so you will have to sweat in the selection of a decent place to live.  Here are some tips: <br><br><ul><li>  take housing near the conference for the first days, and then move to San Francisco (if you have never been there).  To live in the city and go to Mountain View for three days in a row will mean a rise at 6 am and a coma on an electric train for you.  Only Google employees with a salary of 200k per year can afford this. </li><li>  hotels will rip you off </li><li>  make friends and rent a big house.  It's cheaper, and ... you will have friends </li></ul><br>  So, there is housing, a couple of words about: <br><br><h3>  Transport </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6o/v-/rw/6ov-rw5h1lzvjszoqgpotkoeuny.png"><br>  <sub>The site is located within walking distance of Google‚Äôs offices in Mountain View.</sub>  <sub>But from San Francisco to go far enough - 12 hours</sub> <br><br>  As it turned out, (surprisingly) Silicon Valley is rather big.  Starting from the Federation Council and up to San Jose, here and there huge complexes, offices, closets and cellars of various companies and start-ups are scattered.  It would seem that here all the power of the world, all the money here, wireless monorails Ilona Mask, walking speed robots Jim Bezos, clockwork monkeys and other wonders of thought.  But, in fact, you can get from point A to point B in just a few ways: <br><br><h4>  Uber Pool and Lyft Live </h4><br>  UberX and Uber African American, which has come down to us, is nothing compared to the diversity that exists in the taxi market in the Valley.  Here and Comfort (only new large cars), and SUV (6 seats) and beyond.  They say that once Uber offered even helicopters.  But the most popular rates are Pool and ExpressPool (and similar to Lyft).  What it is?  If you ever ride a bus, this is it.  Only the usual Pool still will pick you up, but before the Express you have to stomp on foot.  But there, and there you will not go right where you want, you will have fellow travelers.  However, it is worth it: saving up to two times, and the savings, then earned. <br>  <b>Travel time:</b> unpredictable.  In the morning, 8,000 people are going to the conference, and thousands more Google employees work around the corner, and this surprisingly creates traffic jams.  And these fellow travelers ... <br><br><blockquote>  Awkward situations that you will not experience in Russia, but which are constantly encountered in the United States: <br><br><ul><li>  you open the door to Uber (with a tint), and some dude is looking at you in shock </li><li>  in one toilet throughout the vast territory of the United States you will not find a brush, and you <i>need</i> </li><li>  crazy homeless in the whole street undertakes to kill some Suzy, and then apologizes to you that he prevented you from passing </li></ul><br></blockquote><br><h4>  Caltrain </h4><br>  In our: train.  Two-story colossus, which drags monstrous diesel locomotive, devouring the annual supply of oil of a small European state.  Rides on schedule, which is good.  It goes extremely slowly, which is bad.  The most normal way to travel in terms of time / money. <br>  <b>Time</b> : if you live near the station, then go to the conference rate, at least you can predict the time on the way.  From the station to the site go google shuttles. <br><br><h4>  Bart </h4><br>  Or subway.  Or aboveground.  Or "hey in the car some bums and smells bad."  Do not drive around the Valley, the last stop at all Warm Springs, you do not need to go there. <br>  <b>Time:</b> if you need to move somewhere within the Federation Council - then the rules, if you are squeamish - it's better not to sit on the seats. <br><br><h4>  Rented car </h4><br>  Expensive, rich.  But Americans are a car nation.  Without cars here is difficult.  The problem with this particular conference was that it was announced as a ‚Äúno-parking event‚Äù.  The reasons, of course, were in an effort to save the planet and give the future to our children ( <i>go on foot, your strong legs will feed the children later</i> ).  However, it did not save from traffic jams, and the parking as a result was just a little further away from the conference venue and was not particularly advertised. <br><br><blockquote>  By the way, according to rumors, because of the desire to ‚Äúgreen the garden‚Äù at the conference, there was nowhere so much beloved swag.  Neither you have stickers, nor T-shirts or other non-biodegradable waste of humanity.  Instead of any nasty things on the racks you could get badges.  Metal with paint, apparently, does not harm the planet <br></blockquote><br>  Regarding the car rental, I can recommend such an application (not advertising, the post is not paid for, used by myself), as Turo.  The point is that people in America buy cars they don‚Äôt need.  A loan must be paid.  Therefore, they rent them out, on the "ride".  From the differences from conventional steel - it seems to be cheaper, but what‚Äôs definitely not there is filling in a million pieces of paper, standing in a queue and so on.  I just regretted, found the car, arrived, took the keys.  So for the first time in my life I rolled on such a thing: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/r1/jz/yg/r1jzygqe5gpmm4dcnsaf5vi5_i4.png"><br>  <sub>This is the best thing that made humanity</sub> <br><br>  Tesla is really the coolest thing I've tried in my life!  Unfortunately, in Russia it‚Äôs not so <a href="https://twitter.com/MaxKamm/status/1083652429147762689">easy to</a> use its benefits. <br><br>  Well, enough about all this nonsense.  To the point!  What was at the conference and what has changed from the previous one? <br><br><h2>  Day 0 </h2><br>  The best thing you can do the day before the official opening of the conference is to eat and drink free then.  No, of course, this can be done perfectly and without going anywhere, but have you seen the current dollar rate?  Usually, large companies, like Intel or Netflix, hold something like a pre-party, where anyone can come (after registering) and hang out a little.  The main thing is to register in advance.  Usually you can google on request "Google i / o zero day party" or something like that.  This year I was at an Intel party: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_t/_6/5z/_t_65zfxmklijmizwbghmiq1ifk.png"><br>  <sub>Intel Party</sub> <br><br>  It is clear that companies do it for a reason.  For example, Intel put up a certain number of stands with employees, having talked with them, it was possible to get a ‚Äútoken‚Äù.  And typing 25 of these tokens could get a bag with souvenirs.  I can not recommend, some spent an hour and a half to collect the tokens, and then it turned out that it was not worth it, and the souvenirs are not that enticing.  Better have fun, meet new people, have a beer.  However, here everyone decides who beer tops, and who souvenir roots. <br>  <b>Attention</b> : at all events where alcohol is given, it is imperative that you are over 21 years old.  Somewhere you are given a special bracelet, somewhere they are not allowed at all without an ID. <br><br>  But here, you returned home, safe and sound, slept well and are ready for: <br><br><h2>  Day 1 </h2><br><br>  The main feast, the feast of the spirit, the reason why everyone comes to God knows where it comes from is, of course, the opening report from Sundar Pichai, which this year was ... ordinary.  Not Sundar, of course, but a report.  Well, well, a <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/jugru/blog/450890/">lot of things were</a> announced, but there was no wow effect.  To each his own, zazhralis-with, mde. <br>  True, I can not help but note that Flutter has become much more at the conference, which personally pleases me most. <br><br>  <i>Below is a little about FLutter, if you are not interested - you can skip, but I will not forgive you</i> <br><br><h3>  Flutter </h3><br>  In general, it's nice to see that the Dart language (which we have been using in Wrike <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/wrike/blog/330832/">for many years</a> ) has finally found a decent frame.  Like a raw diamond, it shone in the darkness, for now ... well, enough, otherwise it will cause unnecessary holivars, followed by better in our cozy <a href="https://t.me/rudart">chat room</a> .  But Flutter was really quite a lot.  Reports, Study Jam, sessions and your pavilion is growth.  They also announced Flutter for web, however, having lost such a sweet name ‚ÄúHumminbird‚Äù on the way.  Well, home devices such as the Home Mini are now writing the interface to Flutter.  What from this will be - we will live, we will see.  I'm bringing a handful of badges and a birdie for the community <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/az/lx/x9/azlxx9ooxnf2amuv9swfpewat60.png"><br>  <sub>Bird plump, climbed only legs.</sub>  <sub>Catch me at some event for the badge, or come visit Wrike</sub> <br><br><h2>  About reports </h2><br>  All activities, as in the past year, focused on four formats: <br><br><h4>  Reports as reports </h4><br>  Classic with slides, video recording and more.  Everything is on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleDevelopers/playlists%3Fview%3D50%26sort%3Ddd%26shelf_id%3D81">YouTube</a> , so, in principle, they are not something that is directly required to visit.  Touch the legends and find out everything before others - perhaps.  However, I advise everyone to book in advance through the I / O website or through the official app.  Otherwise, the legends can be seen only on the mobile screen, standing in line at the entrance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f3/2e/et/f32eetcuad_-uauvqt5rfby_yby.png"><br>  <sub>Main stage</sub> <br><br><blockquote>  The harsh reality has made the Russian-language conferences also harsh: both participants and speakers.  And even coffee breaks are usually harsh (try to get through).  Russians don't smile, as locals say.  Have you ever seen a pack of wolves in a hungry winter?  I am not, but it seems to me that if someone from the stage tried to tell us something like ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù, they would bite. <br>  However, on Google I / O, oh-oh-a very large part of the reports was oh-oh-very light.  "Look, guys, this is a browser."  Of course, such is the specificity of what to do.  However, if you are not a novice in the industry, a veteran of web development chewed by life, or a shell-shocked Android player in battles, then it is likely that you will be bored. <br></blockquote><br><h4>  Tents </h4><br>  As in the fairy tale about Aladdin - <i>Behind this door will be a large room full of gold, precious stones, weapons and clothing.</i>  <i>Take for yourself what you want, and bring me only the old brass Pixel 3a</i> . <br>  At the conference there were several zones made like circus tents and filled with a variety of entertainment.  <s>Magicians, jugglers, bearded women.</s> Stands for AR, artificial intelligence, Chrome and more.  The beauty of it was that the same people who did these things stood on the stands.  I mostly hung around in the Web and Flutter zones, but it came off in full there.  Touched <i>Addy Osmany</i> , breathed in the back of <i>Jake Archibald</i> and even said: <i>‚ÄúHi, man‚Äù to</i> <i>Paul Irish</i> (he did not notice me). <br>  Aside from the jokes, it was a great opportunity to talk to all of the main people in the development of Google.  Already at least it was worth it to go. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kn/l9/n8/knl9n8ssuqcrhuwxjl8eihkhe74.png"><br>  <sub>Android tent</sub> <br><br><h4>  Office hours and App review </h4><br>  Imagine that you are writing a term paper on physics, come to defend yourself, and Einstein is sitting there and says: <i>‚ÄúOh, you have a typo here on the third page, my friend.</i>  <i>Neud</i> .  Well, or something like that.  In the designated hours, you could bring your applications (web, mobile, etc.) and show them to Google engineers so that they could be corrupted.  The thing is not for everyone, but the opportunity itself is interesting. <br><br><h4>  Other </h4><br>  It was also possible to touch Android Auto, but there was such a line that I decided not to even get involved.  Moreover, the iPhone is <abbr title="not">cooler</abbr> .  Several interactive zones and zones for Lightning Talks were scattered throughout the territory.  True, because of the Californian sun, they were not popular.  And, of course, the Community Lounge, where various groups constantly gathered, from <abbr title="Women Tech Makers">WTM</abbr> to <abbr title="Google Developer Group">GDG of</abbr> all stripes.  There was a meeting of Russian-speaking communities, where sullen Russian-speaking developers said that there were no stickers and gifts this year. <br>  In general, there was something to do, but you could also pass the time while standing in line for lunch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jc/ie/m7/jciem7wp2u9vgeikrcj_mdv0fy4.png"><br>  <sub>A small part of the Russian-speaking community on Google I / O</sub> <br><br><h4>  About food </h4><br>  Who likes cold sandwiches?  Who is ready to eat them three days in a row?  I have good news for you!  I wrote about food at <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/wrike/blog/358392/">that time</a> , and nothing much has changed here.  No, I'm not complaining, to feed 8,000 people so that no one is crushed in the crowd, and everyone is more or less full - the task is not easy.  So it's a sin to complain, especially since there were quite a few snacks, including those cucumbers in the bag! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wt/bl/tf/wtbltffmkrx89rfw-jvnamnl2xq.png"><br>  <sub>Various snacks: chips of all kinds, dried pineapples, nut bars, cookies and figs (like fruit) biscuits</sub> <br><br>  The dinners were a bit strange, for example the first day was a sweet chicken!  waffle!  horn!  On the second day they gave something more interesting, but I do not remember drinking a beer. <br>  In short, you won't be hungry, and thanks for that.  However, it was better for lovers of something special to take food with them.  Walking to Mountain View for lunch is still entertainment. <br>  Probably, it seems that I am writing only about food and reports.  But the second day was ... <br><br><h2>  Day 2 </h2><br>  And some more cultural differences: remember, I was talking about a pack of hungry wolves?  Just imagine that wolves are still with a hangover and have not slept enough.  That would be something like this, if you gave the first report of the second day at 8:30 in the morning.  Also, unfortunately, an interesting report.  And then nothing, someone did not come, someone was swollen, but, in general, everything was hearty. <br>  I will not describe the second day in its entirety, it is not fundamentally different from the first, except ... <br><br><h4>  Concert </h4><br>  Suppose you have money.  Suppose you have a playground, equipment, light, sound.  And you have eight thousand people.  How to make them so exhaled, and said: "Wow!"?  That's right, <s>give them all Pixel 3a</s> .  But this year somehow didn‚Äôt grow together with the phones, so on the evening of the second day the main stage appeared: <i>‚Äúan alternative musical group from Oklahoma City, USA, the most important representatives of the non-psychedelic scene,‚Äù</i> <i>The Flaming Lips</i> .  If this name doesn‚Äôt tell you anything, me too.  However, an American friend assured me that they are legends and icons!  Well, let's take the word, but the show they gave a very ... specific.  Lasers from the hands, the American anthem, the glowing horse, veterans of psychedelics can be seen immediately. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qy/bs/qy/qybsqyc3gdkk9hzfykntx66lwuk.png"><br>  <sub>Game!</sub> <br><br>  Under the howls of guitars and <i>‚ÄúSorry, no beer after 10pm,‚Äù</i> we rolled to ... <br><br><h3>  Day 3 </h3><br>  The third day, like potatoes to a burger: it seems you no longer want to eat up, but it's a pity to throw it away.  A couple of good reports, communication, but the day, rather, is designed for something with someone to finish, finish something and inspect.  Nothing special. <br><br><blockquote>  About networking: there are so many people at the conference that even if you are familiar with a hundred or two, you can walk in circles and not meet anyone.  This is a big ambush, well, only if you are not so <s>annoying</s> sociable person who can go up to the stranger and start chatting with him.  So, if you chatting hunt, but scary - choose lunch.  People are defenseless for awkward jokes when they have food in their mouths. </blockquote><br><h4>  Little about gifts </h4><br>  As I already wrote, some visitors were annoyed by the lack of gifts or any prizes this year.  All three days in the chat were timid remarks: ‚ÄúWell, maybe tomorrow,‚Äù but as the ‚Äútomorrow,‚Äù the hopes melted.  Someone thinks that with a ticket price of 1000 bucks you can give something, someone objects that: ‚ÄúGoogle doesn't owe you anything‚Äù, however, the statistics are as follows: <br>  In 2014 - the clock, 2015 - Nexus 9, 2016 - ¬Ø \ _ („ÉÑ) _ / ¬Ø, 2017 - Google Home, 2018 - Home mini, 2019 - ¬Ø \ _ („ÉÑ) _ / ¬Ø.  <i>Alas, my friends</i> .  Maybe next year Google will go to the second round and will give phones.  By the way, the press still <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/ArtemR/status/1125961664568774661">issued</a> Pixel 3a. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ts/vu/qh/tsvuqhobbazt1disecutikxr9vw.png"><br>  <sub>In addition to icons, there was nothing to get hold of at the conference.</sub> <br><br>  Here the conference came to an end and the most important question: <br><br><h2>  What has changed? </h2><br>  Feels like a bit.  But what to expect from the conference of such magnitude?  What will be cardinal changes every year?  It seems to me that it was good, it remained good, there was not so much bad.  Swipe exactly became more, more reports, more demo.  Well, yes, Pixel was not presented, so this is not the case.  My opinion: the conference is shifting towards marketing, the display of new products and shows.  Nevertheless, technical things are smoothly transferred to <i>Android Dev Summit</i> or <i>Chrome Dev Summit</i> . <br><br><h3>  Is it worth it to go and is it worth it to go a second time? </h3><br>  On the first question I answered <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/wrike/blog/358392/">that year</a> , but whether to go again is a good question.  The following story is noteworthy here: <br><blockquote>  On the way back after the first day of the conference, I took the shuttle to the point relatively close to me.  Then we had about 20 people on the bus.  Conversation, we learned that 20 people sitting in the bus, come from 20 different countries!  No one has repeated.  The conversation began about the conference, and ended up with a young man from a small African country telling how he teaches children to program. </blockquote><br>  It seems to me that the first time you go for the emotions from the conference, but the second time you go after people.  For the opportunity to communicate with smart, interesting people from around the world, from different parts of the world who live, program, create, with whom you can find a common language in just half an hour while you are traveling together on a bus. <br><br>  Thanks for attention! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ev/mn/oa/evmnoaj7lflyyhxkvxad5kggdu8.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>PS</b> <i>Hello to all GDE, GDG, whom I met, as well as new acquaintances and old friends.</i>  <i>And by the way, if you read it, then the main secret of I / O - I / O is cool people around you who will make the world and you better.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/451828/">https://habr.com/ru/post/451828/</a></p>
