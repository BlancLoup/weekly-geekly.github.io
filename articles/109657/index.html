There is much in common between them: the same size and resolution of the display, a similar shape, almost identical parameters of iron.  Is this device really legendary? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Marketers did a pretty good job of making hungry gadget men like the HTC Legend.  Unlike Hero, the display is made using Amoled technology, the processor is several units more powerful, the RAM has increased, instead of the trackball, there is now a minimalist optical joystick, the device has become thinner and more stylish.  But these changes are unlikely to surprise anyone.  The main change was the body of the Legend.  It is made of a single piece of aluminum, while the Hero could only boast of a composite plastic feed and a metal rim.

      The design and quality of performance of the Legend is captivating even today, after a rather long period of time after the sales start.  Legend began its journey on the shelves in stores with the company's flagship HTC Desire.  And, despite the obvious advantages of the latter, in favor of the Legends inclined price and quality. <br><br>  The device came to us recently, but, judging by the revival of readers after the announcement, the model remains relevant.  Why not?  What else is on the market with comparable quality solid body?  HTC Legend does not have a receiver yet, at the present price this device can be a good purchase for fans of the genre!  By this we will make a brief overview of this model. <br><br><h2>  The location of elements and their description </h2><br>  I have combined the location and description of the elements to avoid the topic being divided. <br><br><img title="legend" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a92/e53/907/a92e53907d36ff31765ee145b430a724.jpg" width="590" height="331"><br><br>  On the front side of the Legend, a 3.2 " <strong>screen</strong> with a resolution of 320x480. Despite the not very large diagonal, with this resolution, the pixels are still visible. Of course, this is a comparison question. When I used the HTC Hero, it seemed to me that the screen was perfect, but now I have a device with a resolution of 480x854, which fit on 3.7 ".  There are no pixels visible.  Although, if you take the iPhone 4 with an even greater resolution on an even smaller diagonal, then my screen will seem grainy.  Everything is relative! <br><br>  Capacitive screen.  The glass is good, but it is better not to wear a Legend key; a scratch is clearly visible on our sample. <br><br><img title="legend" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/32a/1cf/116/32a1cf116e56df22a8653b102064cf1c.jpg" width="590" height="331"><br><br>  Also on the front side are 4 mechanical control keys (2 combined) and an optical joystick.  The latter seems to me a good solution.  Not that I don't like the trackball, but it bulges and gets dirty.  Although a bit more informative. <br><br>  The speaker is covered with a metal grid. <br><br><img title="legend" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ba/336/f3d/0ba336f3dd850386cb25f130c53748e3.jpg" width="590" height="357"><br><br>  On the left side is a volume rocker.  It is made beautifully.  And this is important, because it is a controlling element in many applications (readers, browsers).  On some devices, the rocker is inconvenient or subject to breakage.  In Legend, the key is comfortable and strong. <br><br>  Top screen lock button and a standard 3.5 mm headphone jack.  The connector is also successful, it is not loosened by the aluminum contour. <br><br><img title="legend" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c16/5d7/d03/c165d7d03ae41927d1f082ddcdae3880.jpg" width="590" height="346"><br><br>  There is nothing on the right.  And at the bottom is the Micro USB input, microphone and eyelet for the strap. <br><br><img title="legend" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5e6/fdc/434/5e6fdc4342c8493da53723bb8d311278.jpg" width="536" height="331"><br><br>  The back side is located on a speaker, camera with flash and battery cover, SIM card and memory card.  <strong>The camera is 5 MP</strong> , the pictures are quite acceptable quality.  Especially considering all the undirectedness of the model in the photo and video.  Yes, the camera is not the fastest and most convenient to use, but the pictures are good. <br><br><img title="legend" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fc0/150/1d9/fc01501d9035ee3c54ec0a5087a304c9.jpg" width="590" height="331"><br><br>  But the cover of the lower compartment upset.  This is the only removable element in the phone, and it creaks, backlash, opens easily.  When you remove the lid, you do not immediately get the <strong>battery</strong> , you need to open another lid.  But after that the battery will fall out by itself.  And this is also not good, it should get with the help of the lever.  And so, the smartphone will turn off in any case.  Access to all the cards is good.  The battery has a capacity of 1300 MAh and contributes to a longer autonomy, compared with the flagships of the company. <br><br><img title="legend" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b76/15f/741/b7615f7417ffcd74d5504084be5a6b84.jpg" width="590" height="331"><br><br><h2>  Iron power </h2><br>  They are not impressed at the moment of the announcement, they are not impressive even now.  Should they?  - Not.  This is not a flagship, the Legend is not positioned as a multimedia processor or as a photo / video monster.  It's just a reliable and high-quality smartphone on Android.  If you do not demand excellent performance from it in some games, the device will cope with all the tasks.  It contains: <br>  <strong>Processor / Chipset</strong> <br>  Qualcomm MSM 7227, 600 MHz <br>  <strong>Memory</strong> <br>  flash: 512 MB <br>  RAM: 384 MB <br>  <strong>Built-in GPS receiver</strong> <br><br>  These are the main parameters.  By the way, the screen resolution only contributes to speed.  The same Angry Birds go flawlessly on the HTC Legend. <br><br><h2>  BY </h2><br>  Legend is being sold with Android 2.1 version.  Just at the time of this writing, the company's official twitter announced the update of Legends to 2.2 already tomorrow.  In general, HTC delights its customers much more than other manufacturers, at least in the matter of software updates. <br><br>  As is customary, the Sense shell was transmitted through the pedigree apparatus.  Is it comfortable?  Is it good?  It is unlikely that anyone will argue that this is a matter of tastes and preferences.  It is usable, it is not raw.  These are my impressions, but I prefer naked Android. <br><br><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><br>  I have repeatedly said that the best of all are packing their offspring Apple and HTC.  Legend is no exception, the packaging is of good quality, deserves a separate place in the room.  A device from such a box is more pleasant to use than any other way! <br><br><img title="legend" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a4c/7ac/c53/a4c7acc53f5fdadbfa6b317ac2a7033d.jpg" width="590" height="480"><br><br>  Inside you will find: <br><ul><li>  HTC Legend - 1 pc; </li><li>  Battery - 1 pc; </li><li>  Charger - 1 pc; </li><li>  YUSB-lace - 1 pc (start to invest one more, so that you can be at home and at work); </li><li>  Very average headphones - you could not invest; </li><li>  Micro USB 2GB memory card - 1 pc. </li></ul><br>  No wonder.  Everything is. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f03/5bd/ef6/f035bdef6cf45576d362841706f35057.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Should I buy? </h2><br>  This is up to you.  In this price range are: <br><ul><li>  LG Optimus One; </li><li>  HTC Gratia; </li><li>  Motorola Milestone. </li></ul><br>  Optimus is a great smartphone.  I would say the choice between him and the Legend is a matter of taste and conviction.  In favor of HTC plays the case and Sense. <br><br>  Grace is almost a clone.  Nearly. <br><br>  The milestone is a bit more expensive, but in many ways it wins.  However, if you do not need a mechanical keyboard and a huge screen - Legend is for you. <br><br>  If you look at common features - HTC Legend is a good model.  Memorable, comfortable, with its own character.  This smartphone can not be called one of the gray mass, it is different.  But not without flaws.  I really don't understand why the plastic cover is so creaky.  And against the background of a piece of aluminum, this is especially noticeable.  I hope not in all instances. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109657/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109657/</a></p>
