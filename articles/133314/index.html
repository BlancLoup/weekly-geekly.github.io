I think if I do this project, and I know about every last tsiferki and bolt, then I can present and tell at any time as I can.  After all, my project is cool, and investors are just looking for cool projects.  And there wasn‚Äôt much time to learn how to communicate with investors, I‚Äôm doing a project. <a name="habracut"></a>

      My familiar businessman turned out to be a very significant figure at this fair, and from the bottom of his heart he tried to help me and suggest how to behave and what to say.  He listened to me carefully and immediately began to adjust the flow.  Where do I start, what I tell you how to submit information. <br>  Something broke in my head for this hour. <br><br>  What about my project?  Is that not important?  How are those innovations and those real results that have spent a lot of money, effort and time? <br><br>  I looked at how investors communicate with project representatives at the stands.  For all, the essence of the type immediately becomes clear.  No matter how innovative the idea is, they think that you can immediately stick into any idea. <br>  Here you have one of the standards of investors: <br><br>  <i>The idea should be stated in a few words so that everything is clear to everyone.</i> <br><br>  Not new?  Yes, it is not new, but if it is impossible to state the idea in a few words.  If it is so deep that it is impossible to encode all this depth of discovery in a five-minute presentation. <br>  Here it is possible to deduce the regularity; the more complex the invention, the more difficult it is to describe it in existing terms.  But on the other hand, complex inventions and give birth to ambitious projects.  Those.  Investors should be as interested as possible in projects based on complex inventions. <br>  Thus, investors, in theory, should carefully delve into the essence of innovation, listen to what the inventor himself says, as he can.  And look for projects that you cannot tell in two words.  Such tactics can make the investor more successful. <br>  Duck we have nothing like that. <br>  Not projects are cool, but people who have loot.  Projects like millions.  Investors are looking at this flock of sheep and they think who they will eat this time, choosing the one who bleats the most beautiful. <br><br>  I have a desire to turn everything 180 degrees. <br>  Let capital begin to dance to the tune of intelligence. <br>  Money in the development of the project is necessary and it is necessary to attract them from the outside.  But if you really have a great invention at the heart of the project, then you have to act differently.  Do not hang out at all kinds of start-ups and do not try by all means to meet the standards of venture investment. <br><br>  <b>The main standard that covers everything is a truly existing innovation.</b> <br><br>  That investor who has enough mind to earn perspectives of the strong invention will earn.  Indeed, at first we need very little money, and then steep funds, when it becomes clear to everyone, they buy these projects for great money, and then the industry sharks invest billions in order to possess these technologies. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt know how to turn this situation around for people who have made serious discoveries and spent years on their development, systematization and implementation in practice. <br><br>  I propose to discuss in the comments how to create such a situation in order to arrange an auction for investors to sell strong and expensive projects, instead of start-up fairs. <br>  How can you, without spending a lot of energy trying to meet the often stupid standards, tell the world that you have a strong project and have a great future?  How to make investors spend time developing a deep understanding of the project in the future?  How should the owners of the intellect behave themselves in order for capital to dance to their tune? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133314/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133314/</a></p>
