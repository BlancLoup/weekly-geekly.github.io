Events will be held September 26-27, that is, next Thursday at the RIA Novosti site, it will be possible to personally meet and learn all the subtleties of the new OS and other new Microsoft chips ... <br>  BUT, in order for the event to be successful (which means interesting and informative for the audience), you need to apply very many forces at the preparation stage.  About how this happens, in more detail, under the cut. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/09d/9fb/88c/09d9fb88c6deea0e2e34223d00c45ef0.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h1>  Labs, labs, labs </h1><br><br>  Perhaps, besides the reports of the speakers (well, besides the delicious food), the most interesting (if not the most useful) for the participants are always live demonstrations and laboratory work.  If the former clearly demonstrate the deployed solution and its scope, the latter allows you to personally get experience in setting up and working with the product or technology. <br>  So, these things just fell into my area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility at these events.  Let's start by describing the demo booths and what we want to see on them. <br><br><h1>  Demo stand will always stand </h1><br><br>  We will be consistent, and we will begin with the story about the demonstration of the first day, September 26, MMS. <br>  To demonstrate the joint collegial efforts of representatives of Microsoft and our colleagues from HP (who, by the way, provided us with VERY interesting pieces of hardware - for which many thanks to me personally from me - it is always very cool and interesting to dig deeper with high-quality, powerful and rare equipment) the decision that it will be interesting to demonstrate the deployed quotient, no, not even a hybrid, cloud based on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/evaluate.aspx">Windows Server 2012</a> , <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx%3Fid%3D34607">System Center 2012 SP1 Beta</a> and <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/ru-ru/">Windows Azure</a> .  Also on this platform is planned to deploy labs for the second day of the event - September 27. <br><br>  For the demonstration, I was given a c3000 basket, 4 blades BL460 G8 with 64GB of RAM and 2 samples each, a pair of 300 GB 15K SAS disks per blade.  Also in the basket there is storage P4000 with 2 TB of disk space.  Just the most it is for demonstration of System Center 2012 in conjunction with the new Windows Server 2012. Here it is, my beauty (basket) of my dreams (home))).  The display of hard disks is very interesting - if you have a disk configuration in RAID 0, then the LED light on the eject button lights up, warning you not to remove the disk, if you do not find RAID 1, you will not find the difference from the usual button.  It is a pity there is no mechanical lock ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9cf/829/8f0/9cf8298f0770aa04c7642c088b79bf40.jpg"><br><br>  The basket also has an internal network of 10GB / s, which makes it very efficient to exchange data between the blades - believe me, it is a real pleasure to see 150GB of VMs with Windows Server 2012 demo labs fly over the blade at a speed of 500 Mb / s (not forget about optimizing the size of the jumbo frame data packets).  And if you remember that Windows Server 2012 can make HA-based configurations on SMB 3.0 ball - then there is a lot of tasty things waiting for us ... But we will not deprive you of the pleasure of personally seeing this and trying it. <br><br><h1>  Cloud private or just Fast Track </h1><br><br>  In any case, virtual computers with WS2012 labs are deployed on hosts and everything works just fire! <br>  It remains a matter of small to deploy a private cloud on the basis of System Center 2012, which is what I‚Äôll be doing in the next couple of days. <br>  In order not to reinvent the wheel, Microsoft, together with its iron partners, developed the initiative <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/private-cloud/fast-track.aspx">Private Cloud Fast Track</a> . <br>  At its core, this is a hardware and software selection of hardware and iron software for integration with Windows Server and System Center, which has been validated by vendors.  That is, in other words, this is a bundle with a platform for a private cloud that scales to your needs. <br>  We will not dwell on this, especially since in the future we expect a number of articles and video materials with more detailed description and discussion of such platforms from different vendors, not just HP.  In the meantime, I work, in fact, with Private Cloud Fast Track from HP, and Yevgeny Marchenko, a fiery specialist in HP server hardware, helps me with this from HP.  The photo is with us a little lower (you can see how much power I sucked out of Eugene - here I am IT vampire). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9a4/365/211/9a4365211db4d3e87263bb035b90b8bc.jpg"><br><br>  So the most interesting thing is that the integration of the cloud with the HP features is still only ahead - and I will tell you about it another time. <br><br><h1>  Where is super iron !? </h1><br><br>  Still, the iron should be interesting - and there is nothing super-special in the c3000 basket with G8-blades, just a good box under the cloud, but that‚Äôs the DL980 case with 8 percent and (here the heart was fidgeting at the outcome) 2TB of RAM !!!  I don‚Äôt know how you are, but I don‚Äôt work every day with such dense stuffing, well, MSA 2000 is somewhere around with 6 TB of ROM-NRMD in addition. <br>  My joy has no limits - I LOVE HARDWARE !!!! (see below). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/219/6f8/972/2196f89721e7153b79ba6c67e38c3ae9.jpg"><br><br>  Well, a more vivid picture of the face of this monster, I hope in the future (near) I will be able to make a more detailed review of this piece of hardware from the point of view of a hardware cloud platform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8c6/3df/7c1/8c63df7c1d7ecc32c2430d3cab482fb8.jpg"><br><br>  So on what to carry out good labs we have everything, we will now prepare (yum-yum). <br><br><h1>  IT Camps and IT Camps </h1><br><br>  For those who for some reason did not have time to register for the main event - we have great news, and not even one! <br>  First, you can watch the broadcast. <br>  Secondly, after the IT Camps in Moscow - we will have the whole Road Show in different cities of the country - do not miss the moment. <br>  And thirdly ... Exclusive Pre-IT Camps will be held tomorrow and Friday, September 20 and 21, respectively. <br>  The format of these events will be closer to the format of meetings with the community - that is, less formal, and the duration is only 4 hours, the audience is small, 20-30 people - so it will be possible in a more comfortable atmosphere to talk about the new Windows Server 2012. <br>  And here are the dates of events and links to registration. <br><br><h2>  September 20 </h2><br><br>  Moscow - George Hajiyev <br>  ‚Ä¢ Start time: 10:00 <br>  ‚Ä¢ Area: TC "Mikrotest" <br>  ‚Ä¢ Address: 1st Derbenevsky Pereulok 5, bld. 2, Derbenevskaya Plaza, entrance 3, floor 6 <br>  ‚Ä¢ Registration: <a href="https://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/InviteOnly.aspx%3FEventID%3D52-E5-D2-0F-0D-8B-88-40-8B-5E-67-49-2F-B5-DC-DA%26Culture%3Dru-RU%26community%3D0">msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/InviteOnly.aspx?EventID=52-E5-D2-0F-0D-8B-88-40-8B-5E-67-49-2F-B5-DC-DA&amp;Culture=ru -RU &amp; community = 0</a> <br><br>  St. Petersburg - Alexander Shapoval <br>  ‚Ä¢ Start time: 10:00 <br>  ‚Ä¢ Platform: Microsoft Office <br>  ‚Ä¢ Address: Aptekarskaya Embankment, 20 letters.
