The nearest digital characteristics of the existing products are relatively absent: each separately up and down, forming a list with relevance weights. <br>  2. Substitution of text variables and search in the list (from item 1) using the Levenshtein distance algorithm with the formation of YOUR list of relevance weights. <br>  3. Combining these two lists with the summation of weights and the subsequent sorting by weight values: the highest weight will be the most similar commodity exchange. <br>  PS: if you have in the database: ‚Äúyellow‚Äù, ‚Äúyellow‚Äù, ‚Äúsand‚Äù, ‚Äúsand‚Äù, ‚Äúlight yellow‚Äù, ‚Äúlight sand‚Äù - then you must use the synonymizer written by hand for use before step 2 . </blockquote><blockquote>  - The easiest option <br>  Offer products from the same category.  Simply, Fat, Functionally. <br><br>  - More difficult <br>  From the same category, but taking into account the price. <br><br>  - More difficult <br>  Write a function that searches for goods according to fundamental characteristics, for example, if it is a clothing store, then such a characteristic is clothing size.  Well, look respectively in the same category. <br><br>  - a perversion <br>  For each product to assign similar manually.  I saw in the CMS as such an implementation. <br><br>  There are many ways, only you can choose what you want. </blockquote><blockquote>  In addition to the above - you can tie the tagging, and produce products with matching tags (more than one match, sort in order of decreasing the number of matches).

The 152 CC lawsuit creates more problems for the plaintiff than for the defendant, since he himself spins to collect evidence that he is ‚Äúnot a camel‚Äù (if he did not like being called a camel). <br>  In the worst case for you, if the defendant wins a lawsuit on 152 GK, then you still indulge in deleting that text (what it requires from you without a trial), in that place write a couple of lines of refutation and nothing more. <br>  128.1 of the Civil Code is not applicable to you, as it considers the ‚Äúdissemination of knowingly false information‚Äù that does not apply to your case, since you had no idea about the truth of this information, and no one provided you with strong evidence of falsity (the word of one person against the word of another - not proof). <br>  For their part, all these threats are the usual ‚Äútake on the bluff‚Äù.  However, I recommend that all correspondence with them be conducted under the guidance of a lawyer, because ‚Äúthe word is not a sparrow‚Äù and everything you said can be used against you. </blockquote><blockquote>  First you need to understand: <br>  1. The content of the review itself ‚Äî without it, it is difficult to forecast the judicial perspective. <br>  2. there are such cases in court; the respondent is involved both in the resource itself and in the user (if it can be identified).  if they wrote about the company, then for them the court is not such a problem. <br>  3. you need to understand in what form they demanded it (there is already a formal complaint) and what time it is. <br>  But!  it is likely that they have notarized the content <br>  4. for the outcome of the case (if the court will) it is important what is written in the rules of your resource (is there a moderation).  You are not obliged to conduct those examinations - you can give them the opportunity to comment or delete them (but here you need to evaluate the review itself) </blockquote><blockquote>  So ... In order. <br>  1. What is the forum? <br>  2. On what basis are you and the forum connected? <br>  3. Who posted there "materials"? <br>  4. What is the "materials"? <br><br>  If to abstract, the main question: <br>  And what do you want? <br><br>  It is important that it is written there about this company. <br>  If there is no information that, for example, Chamomile LLC sponsors igil or that a man died from their vodka, then everything is OK. <br><br>  In principle, the above is already correctly answered. <br>  Libel is just what I wrote.  Zavomomolozhnye crime charges.  Did you blame them?  If not, then this is not your problem. <br>  Honor and dignity is like in the field of crimes against the person, and the office here is not clear.  Probably, re-read the Internet diagonally.  Suppose they are described and meant "business reputation".  Then the hellish burden of proof falls on them. <br><br>  What to do?  Well, the first - you can stupidly score. <br>  The second is to go for a dialogue and offer to post their comments.  Or promises to work on the bugs.  I do not know how anyone, but I really respect such statements. <br>  The third is to remove and forget. <br><br>  Court will not, of course.  This is ‚Äúpont‚Äù.

Everything else ‚Äî request / response formats, the degree of compliance with the REST architecture ‚Äî is determined by a specific service, and therefore I wanted some kind of ‚Äúlightweight‚Äù term that would speak of such interaction contracts that run on top of HTTP and correspond to the REST architecture.

The Olympics consisted of two rounds, the first - testing 50 questions for 1 point, and the second - programming, 5 questions for 10 points. <br><br>  So, to get to the second round, it was necessary to score at least 25 points in the first round. <br><br>  The problem of testing was that among the questions there were about 20 in the history of computer science, and sometimes there were questions that were truly ‚Äúingenious‚Äù, such as a rocket did not take off in a certain year due to an error in the program code of the fuel control module, as their grandmother called module developer?  Such nonsense did not want to fit in my head ... <br><br>  The remaining 30 questions were on number systems, mostly examples of the type FCD (16) * 3456 (8) =? (2) <br><br>  For everything about testing, it was given either an hour, or one and a half.  And the way out for me was to bring the calculations in different number systems to automatism. <br><br>  The problem came from no one was waiting for: <br>  1) There were not enough questions to properly train (a pair of crumpled, filthy and annoying paper from year to year does not count) <br>  2) There were no people willing to check what I‚Äôve been deciding there ... And it‚Äôs often fraught to check myself ... <br><br>  In general, I had no choice but to write a program on Pascal, and to draw.  After two or three weeks of practice, I started clicking examples with numbers up to a thousand almost in my mind.  Of course, in the second round I passed each time, completely scoring a bolt on memorizing stupid questions on the history of computer science ... <br><br>  PS: I have a good attitude to the history of computer science in general, but I have a bad attitude to stupid questions like the one I quoted above. </blockquote><br> <a href="https://toster.ru/tag/%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%2520%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D1%258B/interest_questions"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/108/841/8d1/1088418d1ad04367ac9aa5f7dd10d2b7.png" align="right"></a> <h4>  Section <a href="https://toster.ru/tag/%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%2520%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D1%258B/interest_questions">"Organization of work"</a> </h4><br>  Interest Ask: <br><br>  - <a href="https://toster.ru/q/284010">‚ÄúSeveral parallel projects on freelance?‚Äù</a> <br>  <i>If everything is planned out and is measured, then there are no problems, but ...</i> <i><br></i>  <i>1. How do you cope with force majeure when, relatively speaking, both customers ask for "tomorrow"?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>2. How do you estimate the density of the graph for one project (roughly speaking, 2 or 4 can be taken parallel)?</i> <blockquote>  I think bullshit is all.  Itself more than once seriously undermined the state of health and health due to super intensive parallelization.  Need to work on one project at a time.  And slowly. </blockquote><blockquote>  1. A person does not know how to parallel. <br>  2. A person experiences a thrill and it seems to him that in parallel he works faster.  But this is an illusion. <br>  3. Customers do not like such freelancers. <br>  4. More precisely unpredictable freelancers who disappear unexpectedly (because they were stuck in a parallel project). </blockquote><blockquote>  As much as possible, what is enough for me, these are two full-time projects in parallel.  The maximum in this mode I can work a couple of months.  But then you have to take a pause and don‚Äôt not work at least a month to recover.  Fulltime (40h / week) + parttime (20h / week) once half a year.  Heavy.  Small projects (less than 20h / week) in large quantities are also hard to do, since a large loss of time is due to the constant change of context.  So the little things still more than 3 projects are difficult to do in parallel. <br><br>  If both customers want tomorrow, they have to give both tomorrow.  Usually, time trouble does not occur on level ground and can be foreseen.  Accordingly, it is better not to bring up time trouble on any of the projects. <br><br>  Puma Thailand is right, it makes sense to maintain contact with someone you can connect to help if you risk and take more work than you can do alone. </blockquote><blockquote>  I am a designer.  Engaged in two projects always.  Sometimes three, but this is if one of them is ready for being late for a day or two.  I see nothing wrong with that.  There is only one project left - I can work with him for a week. <br>  Now I work 4 hours and 4 I invest in my profession as I can - I draw the UI Kit, I answer your question) </blockquote><br>  Ask and learn <a href="https://toster.ru/">on the Toaster</a> ! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298358/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298358/</a></p>
