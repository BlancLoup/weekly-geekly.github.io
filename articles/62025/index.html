      1) Classic analog cable TV - the necessary conditions: optics to each house (who do not have it now), at least 1 free fiber.  An optical receiver is placed on the house; from the optical receiver to the subscriber, wiring is performed with a coaxial cable.  If the house is large, then it may be necessary to install trunk amplifiers on a coaxial cable. <br>  Pros: <br>  - the subscriber does not need to buy a set-top box to watch TV channels. <br>  - relatively low cost of implementation. <br>  Minuses: <br>  - signal quality is high, but still not digital <br>  - the need to allocate at least 1 fiber in the highways to each house. <br>  - signal loss in long coaxial cables = it is necessary to install amplifiers in large multi-access houses <br>  - there is no possibility to control the subscriber‚Äôs balance and switch it off in time <br>  - scant opportunities in terms of further expansion. <br>  To disconnect subscribers, debtors have to send installers with pliers which disconnects the subscriber from him on the landing (not the fact that the subscriber does not turn on himself in an hour). <br><br>  2) IP TV - the necessary conditions: the presence of a valid network on normal managed L2 switches supporting IGMP, IGMP Snooping (a cheap option is Dlink DES 3526, a good option is Cisco Catalyst 2950), gigabit backbones between houses. <br>  Pros: <br>  - built on top of your existing network, in fact it all comes down to installing the head station, setting up switches, and selling set top box prefixes to subscribers. <br>  - subscribers turn on and off centrally, you can organize several tariff plans, closed channels and so on. <br>  - the possibility of organizing additional Video-On-Demand services (video on demand, virtual cinema, etc.) <br>  Minuses: <br>  - the subscriber must purchase the set top box prefix. <br>  - The network should be built on normal switches <br><br><h5>  <b>Head station</b> </h5><br><br>  Again, there are several options for receiving a signal for your cable network: <br>  1) Installing your head station - <br>  Take the signal from the satellites and from the air, drive it into the network.  There is little free quality content on satellites, so if you want good channels, get ready to pay broadcasters (more on this later).  Depending on how your network is built (IP TV or classic KTV), the configuration of the head station changes, the cost of the solution also varies greatly and also depends on how many channels you intend to broadcast over your network. <br>  2) Reception of a signal from the friendly KTV operator. <br>  A simple and cheap option to take a signal from a friendly operator and retransmit it yourself. <br><br><h5>  Practical - the legal part. </h5><br><br>  To legally provide cable television services to the public and legal entities, you will need at least: <br>  1) The license for communication services for the purposes of cable broadcasting - issue price 15300r state duty + preparation of documents by a consulting organization - from 15000r and higher.  To obtain a license, you will need to conclude an agreement with the broadcaster (at least one) and attach a notarized copy of the broadcaster's license to your license application. <br>  If you provide IP TV services, it means that you already have licenses for data transmission and telematics. <br>  The deadline for obtaining a license is 90 days or more. <br>  2) After obtaining a license, you need to enter into agreements with all channels that you will broadcast.  You broadcast 100 channels, show 100 contracts.  There are not so many channels that donate their content for free, so get ready to pay.  The cost, as a rule, is either calculated on the basis of the number of your subscribers, or fixed. <br>  3) After you have collected all the contracts and if the number of subscribers in your network does not exceed 2500 subscribers go to Roskomnadzor and get an Operation Permit.  If the number of subscribers is more, you will need to do a KTV network project, and conduct its expertise. <br><br>  Only after obtaining a permit to operate, you can legally provide services! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/62025/">https://habr.com/ru/post/62025/</a></p>
