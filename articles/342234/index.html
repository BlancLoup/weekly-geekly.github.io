First of all, such improvement is necessary in order to increase the productivity and quality of the product being created, the time required for development is reduced, and the customer is satisfied with the result.  Thus, we can safely say that testing plays an important role in the development of a quality product. <br><br>  Not so long ago, <a href="https://www.sogeti.com/explore/reports/world-quality-report-2017-2018/">World Quality Report 2017‚Äì2018</a> ( <a href="https://www.sogeti.com/explore/reports/world-quality-report-2017-2018/">World Quality Control</a> Standard) was released, thanks to the joint work of several large companies (Capgemini, Sogeti and Micro Focus), in which a number of interesting trends in software development and testing were noted.  The authors of this report believe that the main directions in the development of software development are the constant improvement of test automation and the universal use of flexible and DevOps methodologies (a methodology that combines the work of programmers and system administrators).  Thus, this report states that companies need to implement intelligent automation and smart analytics in order to speed up key decision-making processes and product validation.  Thanks to such innovations, companies will be able to more effectively cope with the testing of intelligent devices of the new generation and highly integrated products, changes in which are made constantly.  The report also speaks of the need to create intelligent testing platforms, characterized by a high level of adaptability.  Thanks to such platforms it will be possible to provide effective support for the full life cycle of the application. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In software testing, automation tools certainly play a key role.  This article briefly describes the most popular tools and frameworks for automating software testing, the use of which will help companies keep up with trends in software testing.  We include both commercial tools and open source tools in this list.

    <h3>  Selenium </h3><br>  Selenium is considered to be the most popular open source framework designed to automate the testing of web applications.  Developed somewhere in the distant two thousandths and developing over the next decade, Selenium is a framework for automating the process of testing web applications.  During this time, he managed to win the hearts of many testers, especially those who have at their disposal advanced programming skills and scripting experience.  Selenium can be seen as the ancestor of some modern open source test automation tools, such as Katalon Studio, Watir, Protractor and Robot Framework. <br><br>  The Selenium framework is supported by several operating systems (Windows, Mac, Linux), as well as many browsers (Chrome, Firefox, IE, and Headless browsers).  Scripts for this frame can be written on most of the currently popular Japanese language: Java, Groovy, Python, C #, PHP, Ruby and Perl. <br>  However, it is worth noting that this framework has both advantages and disadvantages.  The advantages include flexibility, as well as the ability to write complex and effective scripts for testing developed applications.  On the other hand, in order to start working with Selenium, a tester must have uncommon knowledge in programming and be ready to devote a certain amount of his time and energy to writing special frames and libraries that ensure the performance of certain functions in the testing process. <br><br>  Website: <a href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/">http://www.seleniumhq.org/</a> <br>  License: free <br><br><h3>  Katalon Studio </h3><br>  Katalon Studio is an effective tool for automating the process of testing web applications, mobile applications and web services.  Katalon Studio is a descendant of such frameworks as Selenium and Appium.  He learned from the latter many of the advantages associated with integrated software testing automation. <br><br>  To start working with this tool, you can either have a basic knowledge of software testing or be a real guru of your business.  People far from programming can easily run their test automation project (for example, by running Object Spy to write test scripts), and for programmers and experienced testers, Katalon Studio will be useful in terms of time savings when writing new libraries and supporting existing scripts. <br><br>  Katalon Studio can be integrated into CI / CD, it works great in conjunction with popular tools during software testing: qTest, JIRA, Jenkins and Git.  It provides a nice feature - <a href="https://docs.katalon.com/x/WxVO">Katalon Analytics</a> , thanks to which users get a complete picture of the testing process.  For this purpose, special reports are provided that are displayed to users in the form of metrics, diagrams and graphs. <br><br>  Website: <a href="https://www.katalon.com/">https://www.katalon.com/</a> <br>  License: free <br><br><h3>  Uft </h3><br>  Unified Functional Testing (with English integrated functional software testing solution) or UFT is a popular commercial tool for functional testing.  It provides a complete set of functions for testing APIs, web services, and also for testing the graphical interface of desktop, mobile, and web applications on all existing platforms.  For this tool, an advanced feature recognition of objects based on images, reusable test components and documentation for automatic testing. <br><br>  UFT uses Visual Basic Scripting Edition, which can be useful for recording information about tests performed, as well as for managing objects.  UFT is integrated with Mercury Business Process Testing and Mercury Quality Center.  The tool supports CI through integration with CI tools such as Jenkins. <br><br>  Website: <a href="https://software.microfocus.com/fr-ca/software/uft">https://software.microfocus.com/fr-ca/software/uft</a> <br>  License: paid <br><br><h3>  Watir </h3><br>  Watir is an open source tool for automating web application testing using Ruby libraries.  Watir provides cross-browser testing in most existing browsers: Firefox, Opera, headless browsers and IE.  It also supports data-driven testing and is integrated with BBD tools such as RSpec, Cucumber, and Test / Unit. <br><br>  Website: <a href="http://watir.com/">http://watir.com/</a> <br>  License: free <br><br><h3>  IBM Rational Functional Tester </h3><br>  IBM RFT is a platform for data-driven software testing and software regression.  It supports the ability to test a wide range of applications written in various programming languages, such as: .Net, Java, SAP, Flex, and Ajax.  RFT uses Visual Basic .Net and Java as scripting languages.  RFT has a unique feature - Storyboard testing.  Thanks to it, all user actions related to automated testing are recorded and visualized as sequential images - screenshots of applications at various stages of their testing. <br><br>  Another interesting feature of the RFT platform is its ability to integrate with the lifecycle management systems of IBM Jazz applications (for example, IBM Rational Team Concert and Rational Quality Manager). <br><br>  Website: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/">https://www.ibm.com/</a> <br>  License: paid <br><br><h3>  Testcomplete </h3><br>  TestComplete, created by SmartBear, is an effective tool for testing desktop, mobile and web applications.  TestComplete supports various scripting languages ‚Äã‚Äãsuch as: JavaScript, VBScript, Python, and C ++ Script.  As with the previously discussed Katalon Studio, with the help of TestComplete, testers can perform testing using keywords and data-driven testing.  The tool also provides a convenient recording and playback of the testing process. <br><br>  TestComplete has a GUI object recognition function similar to UTF, which automatically detects and updates user interface objects, which helps to avoid the hassle of maintaining test scripts when AUT is changed.  This tool also integrates with Jenkins during the CI process. <br><br>  Website: <a href="https://smartbear.com/">https://smartbear.com/</a> <br>  License: paid <br><br><h3>  TestPlant eggPlant </h3><br>  TestPlant eggPlant is an automated functional testing tool based on image analysis that allows testers to efficiently perform an AUT.  As for testing methods, the TestPlant eggPlant is completely different from traditional testing tools: it simulates the process as if the user was testing applications, and not the tester, for whom such a process consists of writing test scripts.  This feature allows testers who do not have extensive knowledge in programming to use this test automation tool intuitively.  TestPlant eggPlant is supported by various platforms, it also provides the ability to manage the laboratory and CI integration. <br><br>  Website: <a href="https://www.testplant.com/">https://www.testplant.com/</a> <br>  License: paid <br><br><h3>  Tricentis Tosca </h3><br>  Tricentis Tosca is a model-oriented test automation tool that provides a fairly wide range of functions for continuous testing, including testing and subsequent data extraction, analysis and integration to support flexible programming methodologies and DevOps methodologies. <br><br>  Tricentis Tosca helps users optimize the use of resources required for retesting.  As with other similar tools, using Tricentis Tosca, you can test web applications, mobile applications and APIs.  This tool also provides for integration management, risk analysis and distributed execution. <br><br>  Website: <a href="https://www.tricentis.com/">https://www.tricentis.com/</a> <br>  License: paid <br><br><h3>  Ranorex </h3><br>  Ranorex is a paid universal tool for automating the testing of web, mobile and desktop applications.  The tool is characterized by advanced features for GUI recognition, the use of reusable test scenarios and the ability to record / play back software testing stages.  Another useful feature of this tool is the ability to create test scripts without having to write code.  For those testers who are at the very beginning, such a feature will be an excellent help: testers will not need to have in-depth knowledge of programming in order to conduct automatic testing of their projects. <br>  The tool supports the integration of Selenium for testing web applications.  Testers can group specific test results for different platforms and in different browsers using the Selenium grid.  Discounts for business customers are also available for Ranorex. <br><br>  Website: <a href="https://www.ranorex.com/">https://www.ranorex.com/</a> <br>  License: paid <br><br><h3>  Robot framework </h3><br>  Robot Framework is an open source automated testing framework that implements a keyword-based testing approach for acceptance testing and development through acceptance testing (ATDD).  Robot Framework provides the ability to solve various test automation tasks.  However, its capabilities can be expanded through the introduction of additional libraries using Python and Java.  For example, Selenium WebDriver is a popular external library used in the Robot Framework. <br><br>  Testing engineers can use the Robot Framework as a framework to automatically test not only web applications, but applications for Android and iOS.  The Robot Framework will seem easy to learn for testers who are already familiar with keyword-based testing. <br><br>  Website: <a href="http://www.robotframework.org/">http://www.robotframework.org/</a> <br>  License: free <br><br><hr><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xh/_q/3p/xh_q3pacs7l2bva94a4agdtzdao.png"><br>  <i>Top 5 best test automation tools in 2018</i> <i><br></i> <br>  Thus, each of the tools described above has its own unique set of capabilities necessary for solving ever-changing tasks in the field of automatic software testing.  Thanks to such tools, it is possible to carry out continuous testing and integration, as well as effectively manage the testing process and receive a report on the work done.  These tools meet all requirements for testing mobile and web applications.  However, it is worth noting that intelligent testing and smart analytics for adaptive and heterogeneous environments is something that has yet to be implemented in modern test automation tools. <br><br>  Similar articles: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.qasymphony.com/blog/100-plus-best-software-testing-tools/">100+ Best Software Testing Tools</a> <a href="https://www.qasymphony.com/blog/100-plus-best-software-testing-tools/"><br></a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.sogeti.com/explore/reports/world-quality-report-2017-2018/">World standard for quality control in 2017-2018</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/testing/2016/12/20/the-forrester-wave-modern-application-functional-test-automation-tools-q4-2016/">The Forrester Wave: Modern Automation for Functional Testing Q4 Applications in 2016</a> </li></ul><br><br>  - <a href="https://reddit-marketing.pro/"># 1 promotion service on reddit</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/342234/">https://habr.com/ru/post/342234/</a></p>
