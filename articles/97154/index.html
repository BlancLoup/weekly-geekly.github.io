Not bad, but not new?  And if you add here, for example, the opportunity to ask the cook about your dish or ask him to cook exactly the way you like it? <br><br> <a href="http://reallook.tv/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f47/730/191/f47730191d745acf7a67d1385f129319.png" width="577" height="187" alt="11.17 KB"></a> <br><br>  Launched just the other day, a <a href="http://reallook.tv/">reallook.tv</a> startup from Ars Futurus, created specifically for this purpose, is an interactive Internet TV that allows you to act not only as a spectator, but also as a participant, or even a moderator of the processes occurring on the screen.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  The service is designed as a promotional product primarily - for companies interested in a new format of interaction with the audience.  Reallook.tv offers partners the organization of online broadcasts of their activity with the ability to remotely control the ‚Äúpicture‚Äù of users.  The emphasis is precisely on the professional approach - there are professional TV reporters in the project team who can ensure the appropriate quality of the product.  The user can satisfy his curiosity and learn a lot of new things by choosing the ones that interest him online. <br><br>  In the future, the project will be monetized, including through paid SMS, but so far all the opportunities for users are provided free of charge and without restrictions. <br><br>  Options for the use of this service are limited only by the imagination of customers, perhaps.  But more about this - further. <br><br><h4>  Site </h4><br>  On the <a href="http://reallook.tv/">main page</a> now posted a list of existing broadcasts, announcements of the future and links to the best videos from the already recorded.  For obvious reasons - the project is only gaining momentum - the list of announcements is still longer than the list of working online. <br><br>  From the interesting - broadcast <a href="http://hram.reallook.tv/">from the temple at the First City Hospital</a> .  To religion, to put it mildly, I am indifferent - but the idea itself is excellent.  If you don‚Äôt really surprise anyone with <a href="http://city-fm.reallook.tv/">broadcasts</a> <a href="http://rpfm.reallook.tv/">from the radio studio</a> - on the sites of the radio stations themselves this is ubiquitous, then the broadcast of services opens, theoretically, a huge niche: to pray, to fast, to watch reallook.tv, something like that. <br><br>  By the way, about announcements - habra people can find here <a href="http://habrafootball.reallook.tv/">something especially interesting</a> for themselves;) <br><br>  On <a href="http://reallook.tv/project_info/">the project</a> page <a href="http://reallook.tv/project_info/">, the</a> description is preceded by a quote from Morpheus: ‚ÄúWelcome to the real world.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/19c/43e/34e/19c43e34e95e492243ff27029f3edf3e.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="59.21 KB"><br><br>  Interestingly, how would Morpheus himself take this? <br><br><h4>  Features </h4><br>  Of the additional features - now obligatory for any self-respecting project links to posting on Twitter, Facebook and rss-broadcast.  This is the end of the site‚Äôs capabilities, as far as the broadcasting capabilities are concerned - interactive interaction is still possible only in the broadcasting from the pet store <a href="http://beethoven.reallook.tv/">Beethoven</a> and <a href="http://rpfm.reallook.tv/">Radio Premium</a> .  In the near future, as the creators <a href="http://reallook.tv/faq/">promise</a> , ‚Äúit will be possible to control the video camera (tilt / turn, zoom), backlight, computer‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  How can it work </h4><br>  Potential audience interest in such a project is huge.  But in order to successfully convert it into views, you need interest from those who are shown.  In addition to the ability to simply put a camera and turn the video 24 hours a day on the Internet, reallook.tv provides an opportunity to expand and enrich the broadcast in every way - firstly, through technical means - installing multiple cameras with different tasks (for example, for micro photography), ability to manage them online. <br><br>  Secondly, it is possible to make the broadcast more lively due to the participation of the correspondent in it - with a mobile webcam, it can make whole rounds, which in many cases is more interesting than a statically fixed camera. <br><br>  Thirdly, special programs can be prepared for broadcasting - for example, interviews or live presentations.  One of the authors of the project is TV journalist Olesya Shahbazova, head of the production center ‚ÄúTeleprofessional‚Äù.  Her team of professionals can turn any, most ordinary and routine process into a show.  The use of these opportunities depends only on the openness and courage of the customer, his willingness to use this format for one hundred percent. <br><br><h4>  Application Methods </h4><br>  In one of the episodes of the first season of The Big Bang Theory, the characters established control of electronics in their home via the Internet and shared access - anyone could turn on or turn off the lights, the refrigerator, or even control toy cars.  If they used realluk, they could also broadcast this thing live online. <br><br>  In general, the topic of the possibilities of using such a service is perhaps the most interesting task for an inquiring mind.  Some things are lying on the surface and have already been done, and some formats are just still waiting to be discovered.  Let's say a startup in 24 hours - why not broadcast the development online in real time?  And if you add the opportunity to those who did not get into the project team, remotely participate in the discussion or decision-making? <br><br>  You can invent and offer other options - I think it will be interesting. <br><br><h4>  It's my life </h4><br>  One of the first solutions that come to mind to use this service is the organization of a reality show.  <a href="http://reallook.tv/mylife/">My life</a> is a project showing real people in a real situation.  The show will last 55 days, and all-Internet glory will be waiting for the participants - this is all that is known about it.  Follow the announcements! <br><br>  As in any project with ambitions, there were no invited stars - in this case, taking into account the format of the project, we are talking about the broadcast from the beauty salon Sergei Zverev - so far only announced.  Admit,% username%, will you wait for this? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7f7/8eb/160/7f78eb160bff0ca5966b3d77bedd53fb.png" width="740" height="330" alt="395.81 KB"><br><br><h4>  Instead of conclusion </h4><br>  So far, <a href="http://reallook.tv/">reallook.tv</a> is another startup that has a good idea and interesting perspectives.  What is his future - time will tell.  But to check out some of his capabilities in the Habr business already this Sunday: the team of ‚ÄúRealluka‚Äù kindly agreed to help us with the broadcast of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/tag/%25D1%2585%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2584%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB/">second game in habrafutbol</a> for those who can not come to see or participate.  But it is better to come.  We are still living at a time when presence is better than its effect.  Let's see what will happen next.  Reallook will show. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97154/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97154/</a></p>
