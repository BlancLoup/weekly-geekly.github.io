    <h5>  Go </h5><br><br>  I am here now pretending to be a philistine and will throw everything in a heap. <br>  I will not separate the axis and the iron itself, etc. <br>  I bought one whole thing and will judge it accordingly. <br><br>  Well, now I immediately turn to the list of troubles. <br>  Well, this is not even negligence, just small paragraphs. <br><br>  I am spoiled by iPhones, every day more and more plunged into apathy having met this something called android in real life. <br><br>  And that's why. <br><br>  You buy a phone that is once again being positioned as a killer of the iPhone and in general the flagship smartphone Sony Ericsson at the price of a good, all iPhone is already annoying, turn it on, but it does not turn on. <br><br>  We need to keep longer, much longer. <br>  Are you already accustomed to the iPhone and its smooth inertia interface? <br>  Forget about it, get used to the blunt, blurry, sometimes harsh and chaotic reaction to any of your very standard actions. <br>  They wanted to scroll the list, but it opens the menu item from this list, and no, this is not your mistake, it is a constant phenomenon. <br>  Go ahead, and look for something for what actually. <br>  And for the sake of being able to call, write sms, surf on an Internet, read mail, and listen to music. <br>  Calls, writes, but if you are accustomed to a convenient player, forget about it, you will be offered something that it is impossible to use. <br>  We take the headphones from the kit ... <br>  We throw them in the trash. <br><br>  And it's not that they are bad, no, they are good, but the maximum volume of the phone does not allow them to be used even in normal conditions, not to mention the metro, they save 116dB more sensitive headphones, it becomes acceptable. <br><br>  Put the phone in your pocket iiii ... <br>  Break off once again. <br><br>  We want to make it louder or quieter, we want to switch the track (we forget about the button on the headset :-), but we need to unlock the phone. <br>  A little later, through a long search, a player was found that solved both problems, but my gods, do not dare to remember the iPhone player, it will hurt you, it will hurt a lot. <br><br>  OK! <br>  Incoming call. <br>  I take the phone, I don `t know why, but I try to turn it on, and the power button resets the call ... <br>  UPD: In the comments they say that it should be so. <br>  It is strange that I did not notice this on the iPhone. <br><br>  We want to read the book. <br>  I could not find a normal reader. <br>  About the fact that the phone is locked while you are reading, I will keep silent. <br><br>  Okay. <br>  Launching the browser ... <br>  After a week we find a way to drive the site address into the query string. <br>  The browser is of course not a safari, far from a safari. <br><br>  Further, a battery, such a battery, even two such batteries! <br>  Yes, in komplenkta I had two of them, plus an external charger for a second, but the charger broke for an unknown reason. <br><br>  Do you know that the iPhone did not need to train the battery? <br>  He was ready for work, but not here. <br>  Then he will be blown away on the first evening and he will have to be rocked (trained) for a couple of days. <br>  Hence the howling on the forums about the fact that he is dead, no, he is not dead, he competes quite with the iPhone and even bypasses it. <br>  It is necessary to train him! <br>  Oh how! <br><br><h5>  Multipultitachi forget ... </h5><br><br>  Forget it! <br><br>  Why? <br>  Because patents !!! <br><br>  Sony Ericsson seems to promise everyone happiness, but somehow it already hurts, it hurts a lot and for a very long time, and very messy. <br>  It will be a multitouch, it will not be, it will support, it will not support, then the grandmother from the store will say that they will, but then, and so on. <br>  Well my God, what a kindergarten!? <br><br>  Android 1.6 there, I do not believe that with 2.1 - 2.2 something will change a lot. <br>  And if it changes, it is only supposedly in the fall and about the multitouch they really do not promise anything. <br>  Oh nafig them with their fall ... <br><br>  Adroid market. <br>  A bunch of children's crafts. <br>  No, well, really, just a cesspool! <br>  Well, see for yourself. <br><br>  It is a shame and scary to show it and put it on the phone. <br>  The first thought to remake all these went ugly icons and interfaces so that it would not be ashamed in front of people. <br>  In short, sheer disappointment. <br><br>  Well, of course there are <s>excuses</s> and pluses. <br><ol><li>  I didn't want an iPhone anymore, I didn't get an iPhone. </li><li>  I wanted high-quality sound, I got it. </li><li>  Fotik is beyond praise, just no words, I'm amazed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cc3/d78/3a8/cc3d783a8326d0dc8cdeb94ad34e0ff6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  There is a smile recognition with the appropriate setting <b>Smile level</b> where the choice is offered, wide, normal and light. <br><br>  He is also able to recognize faces (I do not understand why, but this is cool :-)! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0ad/24e/2aa/0ad24e2aa062ed2cdcb87f81f3f5785c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br></li><li>  Pouring files through the computer, no question, easy, simple and fast. </li><li>  There is a special program for makos, it synchronizes music and other buns with aytyuns. </li><li>  It‚Äôs just an awesome integration of gugloservices, all out of the box right away, quickly and easily. </li><li>  All contacts are immediately synchronized, mail, calendar, and so on. </li><li>  No problems with registration or registration, turn on and everything works. </li><li>  Choose the Russian language and oh gods, it's all, in general everything is Russified, even the map in the Civil Code (by the way, is it for nothing, how can I show this to a taxi driver?) </li><li>  The display, well, just gorgeous! <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/56e/09c/33f/56e09c33fc0442acf7c0c9e389291741.jpg" alt="image"></li><li>  I chose this way, put a white iphone and ixperia, the iphone looked pathetic. </li><li>  Very nice, lacquered (white) plastic case. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5a1/e80/b33/5a1e80b331350f19733cc90bacaa8ffb.jpg" alt="image"></li><li>  Quietly ofigel having logged into the server from him through the remoteout, without brakes and glitches, my jaw dropped from this. </li><li>  Pleasant trivia in the form of a memory card and a replaceable battery. </li><li>  Great build! </li></ol><br><br>  You asked to make your photos, that's what happened: <br><br><img src="http://www.atten.me/i/xperia10_1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://www.atten.me/i/xperia10_4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://www.atten.me/i/xperia10_3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Photos from him <br><img src="http://www.atten.me/i/dsc_0021.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://www.atten.me/i/dsc_0046.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://www.atten.me/i/dsc_0011.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br><br>  Sony Ericsson needs to rush to Android 2.1 <br>  And now it's just silly to take it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93070/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93070/</a></p>
