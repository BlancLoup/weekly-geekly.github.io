  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Customer support operator, manager, programmer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Good day, dear readers!  This post is a story of a small, but in my opinion the most remarkable, part of my life.  Actually the article - the path from the unemployed to the programmer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It happened in early autumn several years earlier.  I decided to become more mature and find a job.  I was reluctant to look for myself, and I decided to interview all my acquaintances before.  And acquaintances of their acquaintances.  Further recursively.  After a few weeks of surveys, a friend of a friend of my acquaintance told me that his son works on the client support of a large bank;  having told me everything that I knew myself, including the number of his son, I began to type and ask him.  Hearing huge wage numbers and calculating when I would buy the long-awaited Mercedes Benz, I skipped off for an interview.  At the interview, a cute girl with an unmemorable guy was asked to fill out an adequacy questionnaire containing questions like ‚Äúcapital of Japan‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat day 28 days‚Äù, ‚Äú2 + 2 * 2‚Äù, etc.  Scrolling through the results of the questionnaire and nodding satisfactorily, they invited for a personal conversation.  After telling about myself and answering their simple questions, I was promised a call ‚Äútomorrow‚Äù and I boldly rode home, considering still unearned money.  But the call did not follow in a day, or after 2, or even after a month.  Well, okay, not really wanted. <br><br>  One fine day, at the winter session of the 4th course of the technological university, in a few days before the new year, the bell rang and a female voice explained to me that I had an interview at the bank for a customer support operator.  And they called me so late because I got into the personnel reserve.  A long night of reflection and here it is, the first day of training at the long-awaited work.  The conditions were as follows - a week of training, followed by a month of internship for a nominal fee and after passing all the exams you can take on a contract agreement.  They promised to pay even more than the son of a friend on the phone, although they promised great difficulties at the training stage.  Oh, are you a student?  We have the opportunity to work 5 days a week from 17.00 to 1.00.  Super. <br><br>  The internship week ended December 31.  Having seen the passing score in the decisive test, I realized that I had passed it.  It was given quite hard, because  in the banking business I don‚Äôt have a snout on my ear, and it was necessary not only to understand all this, but also to be ready to explain to the customers!  And the card and the account is not the same thing?  CVV, sorry about what?  International payment system when withdrawing money from an ATM?  How complicated it all is!  Even registering email, blogging and google documents - I don‚Äôt care how much I learned in some 5 days.

      There was January vacation and quarantine in February, so there was enough time to go through an internship month and by the beginning of the second half of the fourth year to go to fully paid work from 5 to 1. New Year's Eve flew unnoticed, as well as the confusion of all New Year holidays and in early January I was brought into the chat of customer support, introduced to my future supervisor and left to delve into all the details of customer service.  A bunch of software systems, each with its own nuances of work, parallel exams and examinations, all this was first difficult, but you can get used to everything, so I used to.  In February, having passed the control exam, they allowed me to my first dialogues with real customers, forgive me for the nonsense that I carried them in the first weeks of my work!  Time flowed out quickly and surprisingly bearable, the schedule was simple - the first tapes were at 8-10 am, studying, by the way, this is not an empty sound, I really learned by writing several tapes in a row notes about all the basics of automation of production processes.  Study ended at 2-3 o'clock in the afternoon and depending on the given subjects I went either to the library, getting ready for control points, or went to the place where I could sleep.  At 5 pm, the most crucial part of the day began - the work shift.  8 hours of listening to the whole truth about the causes of overdue loans and explaining what deposit programs are, why the money did not go there, and of course why I‚Äôm together with ‚Äúmy bank‚Äù such idiots and everything is wrong with us, at 2 am I was at home .  And so cyclically.  It was difficult for the first 2 months, then the diploma began and it was possible to go to school less often, and I began to feel better clients, I went to a normal salary and confidence in work.  But something was still wrong.  I felt that it was not for this that I studied assembler in the 3rd year and sold the solutions of differential equations to my fellow students.  Suddenly, it seemed to me at one moment that I was doing a stupid job that everyone can do and there is nothing special in that I understand how the international payment system works with banks acquirers. <br><br>  Having accidentally found out about the open vacancy of a senior shift in monitoring electronic transactions, I gladly left the annoying chat room, after 8 months of work in it, and went for a month of internship to the department dealing with the fight against electronic fraud.  I was trained by a girl named T, whom I married a year later.  She told me all the details of monitoring electronic banking operations, taught using the software systems of the bank to detect fraud and naturally prevent it.  Finally, it was what we needed!  Difficult analytical work, investigation of traces of fraud by IP addresses, monitoring of skimming, pharming, breathtaking!  Work was 2 through 2 at night, while I had a team, at the head of which I was put.  After 5 months, when I reached, as it seemed to me, quite good progress in monitoring, I stopped tense up at work, all monitoring was limited to checking elementary rules, filling in reports and other routine, which was already pretty hard.  And how it all began! <br><br>  Suddenly, out of the blue, having defended a diploma in the last 5th year, I received an offer from management to upgrade to Internet banking security manager, transfer to a day and work like a white man.  Responsibilities included the management of operators, fraud analysis and the invention of new rules for monitoring payments in the Internet bank.  The analysis was rather trivial - at that time monitoring of the Internet bank was only in its infancy, so it was enough to identify the common features and develop an algorithm from the sample of payments ‚Äî so that there would be no more.  As it turned out in the course of work, I had to not only develop monitoring algorithms, but also communicate with programmers and persuade them to implement them.  After 2 months of fascinating and painstaking work, by chance, I was fired.  It was a strong blow, because  I have never been out of work for 1.5 years, besides, the happy student years were behind me and at the moment I was living with a senior monitoring officer named T. <br><br>  Once at home, I opened Google and went to the Internet for a few days to look for work in my specialty, because I was an engineer for automating production processes!  Having phoned a good dozen of vacancies in my specialty, I realized that life is a pain and for a salary of $ 150 as it is not fun to transfer after what was in the bank.  In the end, desperate, I went back to my long-time fetish - when, programming in assembly language, I dreamed of becoming a programmer!  But I did not get into the Internet in search of vacancies for an assembler programmer, since  already knew that this was a bad job.  We had to find a more popular programming language.  Google returned ‚ÄúJava‚Äù to the query ‚Äúthe most popular programming language‚Äù, I didn‚Äôt argue with it or ask again and eagerly set about studying.  What is difficult there?  I'm already an assembler to some extent already learned? <br><br>  So let's start, the first cast to a better life was the downloaded 2 books, some of Bruce Ekkel and Horstman.  Having spent on them for a week, I realized how much I was wrong ... Objects?  Polymorphism?  What is it all about?  Where to start?  Why go?  Having failed completely in reading, I had an insight that if you watch the video, everything will be clearer, because at the university, at the lectures, everything was clear!  I chose the first site from Google - javabegin.ru, on it a certain Timur Batyrshinnov put 7 familiarization lessons on java, which I looked at and repeated with great pleasure and a little understanding.  After them, 2 books went in parallel - Herbert Shildt ‚ÄúThe Complete Java Manual‚Äù and Vyazovik N. A. ‚ÄúJava Programming‚Äù.  After the video, the situation cleared up and the books went much clearer.  After several chapters, I again reviewed these same videos and revealed new details in them.  In all of this training there was one major drawback - it was absolutely incomprehensible to what degree it was necessary to learn so that there was enough knowledge to get a job.  This continued throughout August, and in early September, I learned that my companion was pregnant and it would be good to call her in marriage. <br><br>  Neither lingering for a second, walking along grandmothers, grandfathers and other caring relatives, having collected the necessary amount and having won back the wedding, I woke up and realized that I still had neither work nor sufficient skills to get a good job, I decided to catch pneumonia and lie down month in the hospital.  The month was quite productive - I continued intensive training in the hospital.  A bunch of ‚Äúvideo + reading + again video + performing simple tasks‚Äù on a certain topic gave a much greater understanding than individually.  Having understood the basics of syntax, abstract classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and finally setting up a SQL server, I checked out and went to my previous job hoping for understanding and forgiveness.  To the surprise of my position, no one was found, and the new leader was not against my reinstatement. <br><br>  Having recovered from my previous position and having promised decent automation of existing algorithms for monitoring electronic operations of the Internet bank, I began to analyze, but not the analysis I had previously done - I discovered, drew a scheme, came up with an algorithm that covers the current scheme - here I had to get a few millionth a sample of payments, to find among them fraudulent statistics, to identify the general scheme and come up with an algorithm.  In general, it became clear that select * was not enough and I had to learn the syntax of SQL queries.  After several months, having understood how subqueries work, left join and dropping the test database several times, I completely abandoned the study of programming and felt firmly standing on my feet - I was not just a fraud manager, I also understood SQL well! <br><br>  One day everything changed.  The bank employs a variety of systems that check the loyalty of employees to the bank, and one of them is polygraph testing.  Having gone there I received a sentence - recommended for dismissal.  All dreams and a feeling of complete stability and confidence in the future collapsed in a flash.  The pregnant wife, who was already on maternity leave, added bitterness every day in a one-room, poor apartment for which I spent a good half of my salary.  A reappraisal of all values ‚Äã‚Äãand knowledge took place in a couple of evenings and I again took up programming.  Knowing that I would soon be dismissed, the process went much more intensively. <br><br>  After n weeks after the failed testing, having passed a serious conversation with the Highest Chief, I was left with 100 honest words until the next testing, which was to happen suddenly and incomprehensibly when.  Having learned this news, I wanted to relax, but the inner feeling of slippery soil under my feet was no longer deceived. <br><br>  Several months passed, remembering the well-forgotten old and learning a lot of new things, I still could not understand what an enterprise is and where methods and classes should be put.  There was a feeling that I understood well, but it was absolutely incomprehensible how to use and where to develop further.  Accidentally stumbling across the network for a vacancy ‚Äúfree Java training on a competitive basis,‚Äù I realized that this is a chance that falls once in a lifetime.  Some company L claimed that if you pass 3 test tasks, 5 months of free training, pass an exam, the best students will get a job.  It was impossible to delay - the first test task - online tasks on Java were on the shoulder and took an hour of strength.  Soon I was contacted and invited to take a written exam.  At the exam, there was no google ctrl + space after each point, they gave empty sheets of paper, 5 tasks and 2 to think about.  With the tasks there were difficulties, what pseudocode is, I did not know then and pile on everything I knew, including JFrame and other heresy.  I was lucky with two puzzles to think about, the solution of which played a key role in my opinion.  A week biting through my nails, I still waited for the call and the invitation for a third, personal interview.  Jumping into the office jump, answering a number of general questions and reading a piece of documentation in English, they promised to call back in 3 days.  The call followed only after 3 weeks, when I had already forgotten to think about training and had been offended by them for a long time. <br><br>  The call was not very pleased, as the courses were 3 times a week, starting at 2 in the afternoon.  Great, but what about work?  The office rat was supposed to sit on the spot from 8 to 18. Again, the Higher Supervisors, to whom I cried in the shirt, helped out, how much I want to be a programmer and that I really need it.  Gave good, but with the condition that I will produce all the same 8.30 hours.  Having carried out simple arithmetic, I realized that 3 times a week I need to come to work at 6 am, then go to four-hour courses, and then still do my homework.  The volume of homework was supposed to be 4-8 hours; she had to be asked after each lesson.  Not afraid, not a bit, I froze in anticipation of the start of courses. <br><br>  The long-awaited courses began, the first rise at 4.30 am, work, the first lecture on Java from a real professional!  It was a gloomy Monday evening and homework had to be done until Wednesday, that is, until the next class.  It took about 12 hours to complete, six hours every day in the evenings.  Having slept for 3 days in a row for 4 hours, I realized that I had to change something, otherwise I could just die. <br><br>  The decisions were as follows: if you want to squeeze the maximum out of your body, then you need to keep your entire body in shape.  Having thought about it thoroughly, having mixed several techniques of advanced gurus (or just charlatans), I came to the following program.  Getting up at 4-5 in the morning, no breakfast, just a few bee perga granules.  In the morning, when the body is asleep, shoving the stomach with food, the body spends too much energy on the launch of the stomach itself and all the digestive systems.  Perga also contains all the necessary vitamins for the whole day and practically does not require the body to digest - that is, it is easily digested.  In order to wake up properly - a contrast shower is obligatory, it helps to wake the body and gives energy for several hours.  Next, a glass of boiled water every hour - so that the blood is always thin and the heart was easier to pump it.  The easier it is to pump, the better the brain feeds and the clearer the thought.  You need to eat lunch tightly - just all the digestive systems function to the fullest, so that the body spends the minimum amount of energy for digestion.  After work, there was a real brainstorm for the brain on courses, after that - a good dinner at 7-8 pm and up to 10-11 study.  By 10-11 o'clock, usually the brains are clouded decently and it becomes almost impossible to learn, because it is not well thought out.  There were always 2 options - either to go to sleep, that it was impossible to do, otherwise you will not have time to do homework, or go for an evening jog - 2-3 km of light jogging and thoughts immediately cleared up.  After - 2-3 hours of study and sleep at 1-2 nights.  At this rate, you can stand 5 days a week, but on the weekends you should definitely relax and preferably at least forget about programming for a day.  On Friday, alcohol helped well, on Saturday - the gym.  It was necessary to sleep everything that was not sleeping on weekdays.  If this is not done, the next week could simply not endure.  By ‚Äúdo not stand it,‚Äù I mean either significantly lose productivity, or score for study.  2 weeks I was drawn into a new rhythm, and after that I felt that I could even sleep less, but did not check. <br><br>  4 months of study flew like plywood over Moscow.  Having lost 10 kg of weight, pumped up the press from running and having built up a very strong theoretical base that turned out to be one of the first students in the rating, I went to my first interview at company L. I passed the technical interview successfully, all the questions about OOP were easy to answer, and bubble sorting was not difficult.  But I successfully failed the second - in English.  Not being very upset, I found out that we were in the bank, you can also go to the programming department, especially since I already knew some programmers as a manager. <br><br>  Passing an oral interview, I got my first job.  Behind was a good theoretical base in Java and absolute ignorance of how to apply it in a real project. <br>  From the first day on the project, everything went very well - it was possible to come to work at 10-11 am, and free fruits and afternoon tea provided a quick recovery of the forces spent in six months.  Every day, every week I got a tremendous amount of experience that was so lacking during the training period - how the application is assembled, how it interacts with the database, where it starts from, how it deploys, etc.   ,   .  !   !  , ,      .      .    ?     !
