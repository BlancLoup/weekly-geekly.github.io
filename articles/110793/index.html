Sitting work is capable of weakly killing health - overweight leads to obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases ... And this problem is of a planetary scale - more than 30% of the world's population suffers from an overweight, which is 1.7 billion people.  With this you need to do something, and preferably efficiently and quickly. <br>  Answers to questions are in the plane of sports and nutrition - but in these areas themselves there are more questions than answers. <br><br>  Therefore, we decided to create <a href="http://gipis.ru/">Gipis</a> - a service that will solve these problems. <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/denbl/view/316264/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f07/79e/6fb/f0779e6fba01ada8242fc1e0fbd0d106.png" width="500" height="308" title="Gipis logo" alt=" Gipis"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The era of fast food has created all the prerequisites for the birth of a new direction, which can be described as ‚Äúfastfit‚Äù.  We need new solutions that allow us to effectively and quickly resolve emerging issues for those who want to improve their healthy lifestyle, just as fast food eateries solve hunger issues. <br>  After all, if people did not have the opportunity at any moment to satisfy the desire ‚Äúto eat‚Äù, then it is possible that the attitude to food and the results of nutrition would be completely different, and many would not have to carry a couple of dozen extra pounds on themselves.

      Yesterday‚Äôs and today's fitness helps to solve a lot of problems with overweight and improvement of shaky health, it‚Äôs hard to think of a more effective tool for putting your body in order, but it also has disadvantages.  And the largest of them are low throughput and insufficient adaptation to any conditions dictated by consumers. <br>  Modern network fitness clubs are restaurants in analogy with the catering system, and the surviving basement rocking chairs are points for selling shawarma, where it is sometimes tasty, but hygiene standards are lame, and the quality of service is not up to par. <br><br>  And if the person who wanted to take control of his own body wants to practice at home?  Or in the fresh air?  If a horizontal bar with parallel bars is nicer than several tons of iron?  And if he wants his hands not to touch heavy iron objects, but to hold on to the wheel of a bicycle or ski poles?  Or in order to prevent conscience from giving up classes, he bought a pair of brand new running shoes and wants to lose weight in a nearby stadium?  What can the modern fitness industry offer him?  How can he get advice from a personal trainer and nutritionist, without wasting his time on the exhausting search for a good specialist and the alignment of the mode of life with his free hours? <br><br>  <b>It‚Äôs not for me to teach you where to look for the answers to these questions.</b>  <b>Of course, on the Internet.</b> <br><br>  Today the best trainers in the world are available for contact - their programs and recommendations, personal blogs and consulting allow you to interact with them wherever you are, there would be enough funds and desires.  However, the main limit for these people is their own time, which is not unlimited, which means they will not be able to help everyone. <br><br>  Next are various blogs, forums, electronic literature and other sources of information.  Of course, on the issue of accessibility of information, everything became much better than it was 10 years ago, when you could buy only a bodybuilding encyclopedia from Schwarzenegger of a bearded release year or find Soviet recommendations on training cyclists on book camber. <br>  However, the situation looks like this - dying from thirst in the desert, hardly extracting drops of water, suddenly covered with a Niagara Falls - here thirst recedes into the background, it would not have drowned. <br><br>  <b>In the end, the consumer needs solutions, not information.</b> <br><br>  There are certain achievements regarding solutions.  Offline there are technical tools that allow you to monitor workout parameters - heart rate monitors.  In addition to the actual heart rate, they allow you to calculate the calories spent for training, which provides certain guidelines for training.  However, this is only a partial solution - without a good training program, this information shows only the ‚Äúaverage temperature in the hospital‚Äù, no more - there are many ways to work out effectively, but there are more ineffective options than an order of magnitude.  It also includes various pedometers, GPS trackers, etc. <br><br>  There are many interesting things online, especially in the English-speaking space.  A number of projects allow you to make workouts in various areas of fitness, and enjoy considerable popularity.  Surely everyone has heard of <a href="http://nikerunning.nike.com/nikeplus/">Nike +</a> , which is already used by more than 4 million people, or <a href="http://runkeeper.com/">Runkeeper</a> with 3 million users. <br>  However, with all the technical bells and whistles, do these projects satisfy all the requirements that consumers make?  No, do not satisfy. <br>  Even if you do not discuss such things as lack of resources that unite all areas of fitness (many combine different sports, such as gym and jogging), giving the opportunity to associate a training program and nutrition, etc., there is an important point that is not implemented in these projects - working feedback. <br><br>  When you work with a personal trainer, he constantly receives information about your changes - the dynamics of athletic performance, body weight, increase in muscle mass, etc.  etc., and gives feedback - adjusts the training program in accordance with the impact, which can be obtained. <br><br>  In the projects mentioned above, it happens like training programs on video cassettes originally from the 80s (it doesn‚Äôt matter that they migrated to other carriers today) - the training program you are trying to perform is suggested.  If everything goes well, you will get the expected results, if you get worse, you will not.  But if this was how a personal trainer worked, you probably would have fired him! <br><br>  <b>In general, criticism criticism - where is the constructive?</b> <br><br>  And the constructive part is that we are doing Gipis - a project that solves all the problems listed - will allow you to train in different sports, link the program with an exact nutrition plan, and most importantly - fully personalize the training, as it gives feedback on current results , altering the training and nutrition program to suit your current progress. <br><br>  Personal trainer and personal nutritionist online - this is an ambitious task we set ourselves. <br><br>  Of course, this task is not easy and requires serious methodological decisions - it is necessary to teach the program to analyze the results of training and nutrition and reduce it all to clear and personal recommendations.  But there are all prerequisites for creating such a project. <br><br>  More than a year ago, on the basis of traditional recommendations for a balanced balanced diet, I wrote the Three Fists diet (a <a href="http://olegtern.livejournal.com/78135.html">link to an article on diet</a> ), which allows you to "algorithmize non-algorithmic" - nutrition. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/29c/137/b67/29c137b674ca15a30c6978f8adbe7d75.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At this stage, the power supply system offers a plan that can be carried out without much difficulty, but what is important, this power is easily parameterized, which means that it can be analyzed and adjusted results.  The food system has already been tested by hundreds of users - about a hundred of my clients who have been trained in a healthy lifestyle, and several times more readers of the blog, as evidenced by reviews. <br><br>  At the moment, a beta version of a fitness designer has been prepared and given away to my clients, which allows them to design a strength training program using a prepared matrix diagram.  This is, in essence, a prototype training program for creating a ‚Äúcyber trainer‚Äù. <br><br>  One head is good - and the team is always better.  Some time ago I was able to get acquainted with such a team - without saying a word, we were simultaneously working on the implementation of one idea.  If my horse is a question of physiology and a healthy lifestyle, then the guys are an excellent technical team that is able to implement bold ideas, no matter how loud it sounds.  In a parallel course, they work out how GPS tracking can be used to gather information necessary for the analysis of training sessions, negotiate with the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences on the use of their developments in cardio training, create a technical implementation of the project. <br><br>  Two weeks ago, we presented the project at the 5th <a href="http://greenfield-project.ru/news/2010/12/otchet-s-prednovogodnego-startup-crash-test/">StartUp Crash Test</a> , which was jointly carried out by GreenfieldProject and Yandex, and received some very useful <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/bobuk/" class="user_link">bobuk</a> comments on the need to seriously work out the legal component of the project.  Otherwise, claims from disgruntled clients, injured due to the proposed training, can not be avoided. <br><br>  Photo report can be <a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php%3Faid%3D40209%26id%3D100000344775791%26page%3D6">viewed on Facebook</a> - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/pancake/" class="user_link">pancake</a> in a yellow T-shirt tells about the project. <br><br>  At the moment, a beta version of the site is being developed, which will be launched in the coming months.  However, after the New Year, the service will be launched into closed testing, an invite to which can be obtained on the website <a href="http://gipis.ru/">gipis.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110793/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110793/</a></p>
