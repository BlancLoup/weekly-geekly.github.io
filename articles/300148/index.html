This time we will spend the day with Yulia Tikhonova, the leading account manager for SEO (Search Engine Optimization) <a href="http://www.bdbd.ru/">BDBD</a> ( <a href="http://kokocgroup.ru/">Kokoc Group</a> ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/2f1/056/7ea/2f10567ea8dc53c90b9e72657b3bec25.png" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>My morning starts at 6:00</b> <br>  For the past few months I have been experimenting: within an hour I put my thoughts on paper and thus summarize the line for the past day, make plans for a new one.  It is believed that this helps to understand deep-seated goals and to live more consciously.  Let's see what happens.

      After that - 30 minutes of yoga, breakfast and fees for work.  Since I live in the suburbs, the journey takes 1.5 hours, and at 10:15 I am on the spot.  In our team (two accounts and two optimizers) tradition: the last one who comes into the office treats cookies.  This time my optimizer was late, they postponed tea drinking at 17:00. <br><br>  <b>The working day began with checking mail</b> <br>  Today is Monday.  In priority - analysis of the online store plumbing.  Last week, a client compared the traffic of the site that we are promoting with data from another resource of his own, and he doubted the growth.  In order to dispel his suspicions, you need to analyze the attendance for the year and the forecast.  On Friday, the optimizer prepared the core of requests, it remains to determine their frequency and collect statistics on site positions. <br><br>  While a colleague is preparing data for analysis, I took up an online store selling carpets.  We have been working with this client for a long time, periodically he asks to make minor changes to the site, but last week he wanted to improve the catalog filter, add the ability to send and publish reviews.  These are complex works and are not related to SEO, so I collected information on changes and transferred the client to the product manager. <br><br>  Just at this point, the optimizer prepared statistics from Yandex.Metrica on an online plumbing shop.  Over the year, site traffic from search engines increased by 66%: in February 2015 there were 11,000 transitions, and in February 2016 - 18,000. The number of new users increased by 62%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/9c0/95c/687/9c095c687012f8fc776e23293c197b88.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Based on the updated data, I advised the client to conduct a usability audit, I think, this will allow to reduce the bounce rate.  After analyzing the websites of top competitors, I found another opportunity for promotion and invited the client to meet to discuss it. <br><br>  <b>It's time for regular final reports.</b> <br>  The other day we completed the first stage of optimization of an online store of workwear.  Comparative analysis of traffic showed stability - despite the changes.  This is a good result for the first month: the adjustments did not have time to be indexed by search engines, then we predict an increase in traffic.  Sent the client a report on the results.  The plans for the coming month include the collection of semantics, basic queries in the Yandex tips, the development of the structure of categories and product pages. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/68b/62f/ec9/68b62fec951ac2c34eaca68c996af004.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The next customer is engaged in scraping parquet.  Two weeks ago, the position of his site on one of the high-frequency queries decreased, and we understood the reasons.  Analyzed the search results, we found a problem in the texts on the pages promoted, made changes.  Now let's wait for indexing by search engines.  I set myself a task for the future: to revise the core of key requests - in the hints of Yandex there are new phrases that may attract additional traffic. <br><br>  Now - the site for the sale of chemical equipment and reagents.  There are good statistics here: resource traffic increased by 69% over the year (in March, due to holidays, there was a slight decrease by 1.92%), the number of transactions increased by 40%, and customer revenue by 18%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/5b1/7cb/027/5b17cb027b668d6b75fadf7da6d848e5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  So, next month we will continue to work on the plan: fill the site and client groups in social networks with information materials, market and company news.  She assigned tasks to copywriters to prepare texts and at the same time checked posts in ‚ÄúVKontakte‚Äù and on Facebook. <br><br>  I decided that it was useful to resume targeted advertising campaigns - and asked the social network manager to prepare a forecast.  Let's see what he thinks about this. <br><br>  <b>Time to have lunch!</b> <br>  Despite the fact that I almost always do it in the office canteen, I try to go outside and take a walk later - sometimes it is useful to change the situation. <br><br>  After lunch, I returned to the morning client: I phoned the owner of an online plumbing shop.  It turned out that the traffic of the site with which he compared our resource was twice as high as a year ago, now we ‚Äúcaught up‚Äù with it - a good indicator. <br><br>  And then the state of emergency: the optimizer found that the owner of the online filter store had updated the site without notifying us about it.  As a result, the resource lost its position in search results due to the large amount of new non-optimized pages, some of them were not available.  While I was communicating with the previous client, the optimizer began to deal with errors and set up redirects.  I had to call the owner of the site and ask to warn us about such changes. <br><br>  I wanted to warm up.  I went to the horizontal bar to stretch out and straighten my back.  Returned to the workplace already to the next client - a site for the sale of packaging equipment.  We have been cooperating for several years and we consider it right to transfer the project to service by traffic, especially since another resource of the same client is successfully moving along the proposed scheme.  In order to assess the prospects, I built a forecast based on my own experience, which was confirmed by the Yandex.Metrica statistics based on the site in the same subject. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/f36/523/0f4/f365230f4f9bbe97c511c8656e5ead43.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As a result, it turned out that when finalizing the resource traffic can grow another two times.  The client accepted the arguments and, in a reply letter, sent his consent to transfer our relations to a new level. <br><br>  There was a free moment, and I decided to set up goals in the meters in Yandex.Metrica and Google AdWords on the client‚Äôs website of medical subjects: I checked the correctness of existing ones and added new ones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/b05/920/a73/b05920a737314776e9443b2850ba7cf1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It's time to take a break for cookies <br>  Those which were brought late optimizer. <br><br>  But I did not have time to finish the tea, as the client phoned in a panic - his site is not working!  - and asked to figure it out.  We found out that the problem is on the hosting side, and thanks to the backups that our programmers save, they restored the latest version of the resource and it all worked. <br><br>  At the end of the day, a meeting was scheduled with colleagues on the ‚Äúburning issue‚Äù: the client's site, which provides financial services, periodically ‚Äúdrops out‚Äù from the top of one of the high-frequency queries.  They found the solution for half an hour, notified the client, and will start implementation tomorrow, because the working day has long been over. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://rusbase.com/opinion/account-day/">RusBase</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300148/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300148/</a></p>
