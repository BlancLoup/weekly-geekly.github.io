What is behind your desire to become the head of the department, increase website traffic, create your business from scratch, or learn to cut with a jigsaw?  Knowing the true answer to this question, you can more effectively manage yourself or other people. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/449/a71/39f/449a7139fcfb477084e21f93d40e28c8.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We set different goals in life, both personal and professional.  Looking at <a href="https://smartprogress.do/"><b>SmartProgress</b></a> for the first time, I was amazed at what unusual desires people might have.  But each person has the power that drives his actions - a specific motivation. <br><br><h5>  <b>‚ÄúOh, psychology.</b>  <b>What is this thing - motivation? "</b> </h5><br>  Here is a simple example: the hunger that you feel is the need, the desire to satisfy the hunger is the motive, and the big meatball is the goal.  Let's transfer it to any sphere of our life. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/200/a36/551/200a36551d34446c9a4cdc3b48b30953.jpg"><br>  At the heart of each motive is any human need: for security, belonging to a group, love, respect, learning new, aesthetic need and the need for self-actualization (thanks, Maslow!). <br><br>  I will not bore you with different classifications, I will list the main types:

      ‚Ä¢ <b>‚ÄúI'm cool!‚Äù</b> (Self-affirmation motive or prestigious motivation).  It is based on the need of a person to take his place in society, associated with self-love, the desire for respect, a positive assessment of his personality, ambition and self-esteem. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>‚ÄúI am a pro!‚Äù</b> (Self-development motive).  In this case, interest in activities is fueled by the desire to learn something new, to develop, to set higher levels.  Such workers are extremely valuable for each organization. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>‚ÄúI am successful!‚Äù</b> (Motive for success).  It is similar to the motive of self-development, only a person who constantly improves the level of skill, does it for the sake of the result, for the sake of the goal, to say to himself ‚ÄúI could, I reached!‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>‚ÄúI am a hero!‚Äù</b> (Identification motive).  This is an imitation of an authoritative personality, from Spider-Man to Bill Gates.  The desire for resemblance with the hero encourages a person to develop in a certain direction. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>‚ÄúI am the boss!‚Äù</b> (Power motivation).  The desire to influence people can be a driving force when moving up the career ladder.  Why do you want to take the post of deputy head of the company: because you want to influence people or assert yourself? <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>‚ÄúI am happy!‚Äù</b> (Procedural and informative motives).  Occur when a person performs an activity because he likes the process and content.  For example, you can play football as guided by prestigious motivation (money, power, self-affirmation, fashion), and simply enjoying the process. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>‚ÄúI am a loser!‚Äù</b> (Motive for avoiding failures).  Often, a person whose activities are driven by this motive refuses most of the bold projects.  And the ability seems to allow you to have a desire, but the fear of being incompetent, getting a negative assessment from society or colleagues makes you remain in the shadows.  Procrastination belongs to the same motive. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>‚ÄúI and the company!‚Äù</b> (Motive of affiliation).  It implies a desire for relationships with other people.  For the sake of communication, people open new projects and in every possible way strive for new acquaintances and contacts.  This communication itself is exciting and allows you to experience pleasure. <br><br>  Any motive can relate to both external and internal motivational sphere.  The first depends on the circumstances surrounding the person, the second concerns the activity itself, the person at this time is experiencing an inner impulse to action. <br>  In addition, the motivation is negative and positive.  An example of negative motivation is the presence of penalties, isolation from the team.  The positive ones include climbing the career ladder, increasing credibility, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/056/b33/1af/056b331af6c6421e8fb4582b12dcee8b.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Methods of motivation</b> <br>  To move things, it is sometimes necessary to additionally motivate themselves in various ways. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Mark achievements visually.  Here comes into force such a psychological concept as a "situation of success."  Being in a situation of success, when everything works out, deadlines are respected, non-standard solutions are invented, you are inspired and you perform difficult tasks much easier.  And I also experienced this myself.  When in my plan for the month completed projects are crossed out, the natural sports excitement wakes up. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Take yourself to the weak.  For example, ‚ÄúCan I, on the first attempt, convince a client of the need for this design?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúCan I really not be able to make this report?  Yes, I will give it 100% by the end of the week. ‚Äù  Just do not overdo it.  Last month I went overboard, now I occasionally want to lay vegetables on the couch. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Declare routine war.  If you are faced with a tedious and uninteresting task, contribute a share of creativity.  I like the joke from the Internet "To make soup was not so boring, try to depict a villainous laugh, adding each ingredient."  Well, I use this method if my work is too much for me.  Only hush, sir, it's a secret!  Yes, childish, yes, funny, but it works! <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Set individual tasks.  This technique is perfect for people with motives of self-development.  Do not feed them with bread - give yourself plans to raise and set more goals.  I love to have so much fun: I‚Äôm setting myself the task of changing the writing style for a particular article, then I‚Äôll set the minimum of books I‚Äôve read this month. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Imagine an unpleasant business in a different light, for example, working on a difficult task for the entire department, imagine yourself as Dr. House or Sherlock Holmes.  By the way, there is a wonderful book by Edward de Bono ‚ÄúSix Hats of Thinking‚Äù.  Read, I recommend. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Find like-minded people.  It‚Äôs not for nothing that the heroes from the cartoon sang ‚ÄúTogether, it‚Äôs fun to walk across the expanses ...‚Äù, because going towards the goal is not in proud solitude, but in a noisy and perky company, as in <a href="https://smartprogress.do/"><b>SmartProgresse is</b></a> much more pleasant.  Well, more effective, what is already there. <br><br> <a href="https://smartprogress.do/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/009/879/e41/009879e418414194ae9363c8bf5298ee.jpg"></a> <br><br><h5>  <b>"Well, the theory is over, and what do we do with this knowledge?"</b> </h5> <br>  The answer to the question ‚ÄúWhy?  What am I doing this for? ‚ÄùIs able to help manage your motivation.  Knowing the reasons for a particular behavior ‚Äî one‚Äôs own, the Big Boss, the employees of the company you manage, or the clients you work with, you can change the goals or the paths to them. <br><br>  What is the use of knowledge of motivation: <br><br>  1. Improving your life.  Knowing when you are working more productively, what actions you need to take and what to avoid, you can create for yourself the life you dream of. <br>  2. Formulation of the goal.  Answer for yourself the main question: ‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù.  And the answer should be as specific as possible.  Becoming famous and famous is not an end in itself.  Glory and universal worship should give you something else: the ability to manage people, the ability to realize yourself, to assert yourself. <br>  3. Productivity of actions.  Knowing that you are driven by the fear of avoiding failures, try to start work from the area in which you are simply an expert.  Such a tricky move will instill confidence, help to relax, to charge with positive energy.  And there and to the difficult cases at hand! <br>  4. Ability to manage other people.  The study of the motivational sphere of workers and the use of this knowledge in the work helps to increase productivity, motivate employees to work at full capacity, to interest the team with the goals. <br><br>  No matter who you are: a director, a subordinate, a freelancer, a startup manager or a parent - learning about motivation will be useful.  Realizing the reasons for your behavior and choosing the appropriate methods of motivation will make it easier for you to manage your life. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296360/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296360/</a></p>
