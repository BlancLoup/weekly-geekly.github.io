  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mail.Ru launches search bot</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the logs of many sites, an index bot called "Mail.Ru/1.0 libwww / 5.4.0" recently appeared.  Mikhail Monashev was the first to notice the appearance of a new bot, which he <a href="http://michael.mindmix.ru/32-469-poiskovik-ot-mail-ru.zhtml">wrote the day before yesterday on his blog</a> .  In this regard, Mikhail recalls the recent CIB conference, where Mail.Ru representatives talked about their search on wap sites.  ‚ÄúMany who listened to their report understood that it‚Äôs close to searching on the Internet from a WAP search,‚Äù writes Mikhail.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember exactly who, said that in the summer Mail.Ru will roll out its search engine.‚Äù  The forecast for the summer was not justified ... And now, probably, many have seen in their logs the ‚ÄúMail.Ru/1.0 libwww / 5.4.0‚Äù bot.  Of course, it is not as active as other search bots, but it is still quite noticeable to assert that Mail.Ru is quietly indexing the web.  And not only Russian-speaking ‚Äù. <br><br>  Of course, Habr immediately turned to <a href="http://www.mail.ru/">Mail.Ru</a> for comments, but marketing director Anna Artamonova said that they are not yet ready to answer such questions.  However, this answer can also be called to some extent informative, because Anna Artamonova does not deny the fact that Mail.Ru is testing its own search engine. <br><br>  Independent experts are inclined to believe that such a move would be quite logical on the part of this company, because Mail.Ru is the only representative of the ‚ÄúBig Three Runet‚Äù who do not have their own search engine.

      ‚ÄúThey had long been planning to create their own search engine,‚Äù says Igor Ashmanov, CEO of <a href="http://www.ashmanov.com/">Ashmanov &amp; Partners</a> .  - Dmitry Grishin (CEO of Mail.Ru, - <i>author's note</i> ) two years ago said that they would do their search, consistently going from special search engines for their services.  The meaning in your own search engine is quite transparent - not to pay ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù or someone else, to unleash your search at the expense of your huge audience, to make money on it, like everyone else.  Compared with search startups, Mail.Ru has a position that is qualitatively better, it‚Äôs easier to spin. ‚Äù <br><br>  According to Igor, Mail.Ru has not yet made its search just because of the principle of opportunity costs.  According to his observations, the communication services in Mail.Ru show much higher growth relative to content and search.  ‚ÄúThat is, the elasticity of investments there is higher, it was much more profitable to invest in a communicator and mail.  And resources are always limited, ‚Äùhe notes. <br><br>  Answering a question about a possible Mail.Ru partner involved in the development of a search engine, Igor Ashmanov responded that, in his opinion, Mail.Ru is independently developing the engine: ‚ÄúThey have long been assembling a team two years ago hired Misha Kostin, one of the authors‚Äù Aport and its head in recent years, made their search engine by mail, Russified <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> , etc.  That is, they have been trying different approaches to their search for a long time. ‚Äù <br><br>  Victor Lavrenko, head of the <a href="http://nigma.ru/">Nigma.Ru</a> search site <a href="http://nigma.ru/">development team</a> and former <br>  Mail.Ru shareholder believes that "creating a search engine from scratch takes about two hours - along with the time to search for the corresponding free software, which is already full.  ‚ÄúCreating a search engine that is much better than the others, and‚Äú significantly ‚Äù- not from a technical point of view, but from such that it is understandable to ordinary users, can take an infinitely long time.  Some do not even understand that you need to go your own way, and not to put free software, and therefore their search is absolutely not popular.  But I hope that Mail.Ru understands this and will do something really new, ‚Äùadds Victor. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4416/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4416/</a></p>
