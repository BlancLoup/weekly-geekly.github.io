Those.  Higt solutions for large corporations are, let's say, more like this, for the future.  Because, all these transactions are closed for quite long (terms-Fabbers comment), there are a lot of nuances, a lot of negotiations, etc.  It really takes a lot of time.  this is what our investors and we ourselves believe in.  At the same time, we have, let's say, a lighter product, a more functional product - open systems for 3D printers - 3D PrinterOS is an open platform.  there you can integrate any printer, any hack, an application and, in principle, now we don‚Äôt take any money for it.  And in the future, it will also be like an android, in fact, everyone, a specific app, will choose whether he wants to take money for it or not.  And we always, our ideology is such that we will always leave a free option for our end user.  For example, if there are some sophisticated slicers that will cost money, then there will always be ‚Äúnear-slot‚Äù slicers in the system for which you will not have to pay.  those.  for smaller 3D printing manufacturers and for smaller CAD application manufacturers, of course this platform exists.  And on it we sharpen, test various applications, then, the next step, we include them in Secrured 3D - a more complex product, a more encrypted product.

      <b>F: - Thank you very much!</b>  <b>And, just wondering, with which major players in the 3D printing market do you work?</b> <br><br>  AV: - I can not, unfortunately, call names.  But, I think that very soon everyone will know about it. <br><br>  <b>F: - Introduced us a little!</b>  <b>Tell me, how do you see the future of your project and its role in 3D printing?</b> <br><br>  AV: - Let's say a plan for the next 3-4 years is to integrate every printer that exists in the world and to integrate most of the applications that are useful for the end user.  We also make our designs for sending 3D models both in the mathematical part and in the physical part.  those.  we will be releasing a sufficient number of interesting applications for end users, which are currently not covered by other manufacturers. <br><br>  <b>F: - In fact, a lot of interesting information, so we will torment you with more questions, Anton.</b>  <b>Tell me, what other ideas, in your company, to create your own hardwar?</b> <br><br>  AV: - Our strategy is such that we do not want and will not compete with the current players in the market, we are not a competitor to manufacturers of 3D printers, not competitors for manufacturers of soft, for CAD and for 3D printing.  We do not interfere in any way with other players, we rather complement, we unite together.  Those.  the parallel can be drawn with the Windows platform, the operating system, i.e.  50 years ago, computers, machines, stood apart, each computer used its own soft, its own standards, its own formats, and, in fact, no one thought that if he wrote his application and it would work on all computers. <br>  and let's say Microsoft and Bill Gates, they created a platform that can work <br>  on different computers.  And the person who wrote the application can spread it across all these things.  We strive for a similar ideology.  And one of our current investors is Paul Alan, co-founder of Microsoft, he fully supports this. And in principle, our goal is to be this single platform for 3D printers, CAD applications, etc. <br><br>  <b>F: - Ie your duels only in the world of software related to 3D printing?</b> <br><br>  AV: - Yes, we have thought that if third-party developers want to get involved in our operating system, through an open interface, with some sort of iron solution, for example, determine the color of the plastic, the quality of the plastic, and even in a 3D printer, if we are talking about FDM printers.  Or, say, if the plastic is over, it (the printer-com. Fabbers) will stop and wait until the person replaces the plastic.  Such things will be integrated, but again, they are produced by third-party manufacturers and we just give the interface and connect it to our operating system. <br><br>  <b>F: - Look, so much work has been done, have you really not thought about creating your own 3D printer or 3D scanner.</b> <br><br>  AV: - Let's say half a year, or even a year ago, we discussed this a lot and with the leading manufacturers of 3D printers, with whom we started building this platform, the system, and learned from them what was really missing.  In fact, we don‚Äôt see especially big money in hardware, iron - it becomes cheaper every day, everyone tries to create a cheaper printer, at the same time it is better.  In principle, this is not our field, we are more focused on software, on which, we believe, you can make much more money. <br><br>  <b>F .: - Going back to our previous dialogue, i.e.</b>  <b>small software developers, with some of their beginnings can join you?</b> <br><br>  AV: - Yes, of course!  And this is one of the main ideas that you do not need to develop applications from scratch.  Because many: both libraries and connectors already have them as a base in the operating system.  We already receive a printer image from a webcam, we already do such things, for example, if a person wants to determine if plastic has run out purely from a video image, can cheat the stream that goes and make an application that will send SMS or write emails or just show the system red (color approx. Fabbers) that this printer has run out of plastic or it prints in the air. <br><br>  <b>F .: - Thank you!</b>  <b>In fact, we have heard a lot of interesting answers today.</b>  <b>And if it is possible the last and, maybe, not absolutely modest question.</b>  <b>Who are your investors?</b>  <b>Is there any monetary basis for your further development?</b> <br><br>  AV: - At the moment, we have received an investment from the Paul Alan venture capital fund co-founder Microsoft, I don‚Äôt want to name a specific amount.  At the moment, we will soon close "Series A", for which there is already a line of investors who want to invest their money. <br><br>  <b>F .: - Anton, thank you for the interesting interview!</b>  <b>We all saw that Secured 3D is a completely breathing, living, growing company that does not discourage the ability to work with small manufacturers of 3D printers, and with newcomers to developers.</b>  <b>Thank you very much, I hope to see you soon.</b>  <b>Until!</b> <br><br>  AV: - Thank you!  Until! </div></div><br><br>  This was the final part of the interview with Anton Vedeshin.
