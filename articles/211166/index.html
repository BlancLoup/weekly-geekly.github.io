Prices are reduced for blob storage <strong>by 20%</strong> for all regions, which makes the price for storing information in Windows Azure equal to Amazon and even cheaper for a number of regions.  Transaction prices received a more significant reduction in prices - <strong>by 50%</strong> . <br><br>  For example, in Windows Azure, reliable geo-distributed storage of virtual machine disks costs $ 0.095 / GB per month.  To guarantee the same level of reliability in Amazon, customers will have to pay for Standard Volumes ($ 0.05 / GB per month) and EBS Snapshot to S3 ($ 0.095 / GB per month), which is 34% more than the Windows Azure price tag. <br><br>  In addition to lower prices, according to the independent report Nasuni 2013 Cloud Storage Report, Windows Azure storage services are ahead of Amazon in terms of performance, scale and stability.  Another independent study, <a title="A Comparative Analysis of 5 Large Cloud IaaS Providers" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/146167581/Cloud-Computing-Performance-a-Comparative-Analysis-of-5-Large-Cloud-IaaS-Providers">A Comparative Analysis of 5 Large Cloud IaaS Providers,</a> shows that Windows Azure is three times ahead of Amazon in terms of price / performance. <br><br><h3>  New instances of virtual machines with support for InfiniBand </h3><br>  For the Windows Azure platform, there are new instances of virtual machines specifically designed for high performance and HPC scenarios.  A distinctive feature of the new <strong>A8</strong> instances <strong>(8 cores, 56 GB RAM) and A9 (16 cores, 112 GB RAM)</strong> is the presence of an additional <strong>InfiniBand</strong> network with a data transfer rate of <strong>40Gbit / s</strong> and Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) technology. <br><br>  This feature, as well as faster processors, faster data exchange will increase the efficiency of parallel MPI applications for solving industrial problems of modeling, simulation, analysis, video processing and building HPC clusters. <br><br>  Currently, new instances are only available for Windows Azure PaaS functionality, web, and worker roles.  New copies can be placed in the US North Central and Europe West regions (the list of regions will be expanded over time). <br><br>  Below are the prices for new copies: <br><br><ul><li>  A8 - <strong>$ 2.45</strong> (~ $ 1,823 / month) </li><li>  A9 - <strong>$ 4.90</strong> (~ $ 3,646 / month) </li></ul><br>  Details can be found <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/details/cloud-services/">on the</a> official portal <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/details/cloud-services/">page</a> . <br><br><h3>  Public availability of the <strong>Hyper-V Recovery Manager service</strong> </h3><br>  The <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/services/recovery-manager/">Windows Azure Hyper-V Recovery Manager</a> (HRM) local infrastructure protection and recovery service has become available for commercial use.  The new service allows you to organize fault tolerance and disaster recovery (Disaster Recovery) for private clouds, offering for this the necessary functionality and additional configuration options, automatic protection, continuous monitoring of vital signs and managed recovery. <br><br><img alt="image" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/434/72a/137/43472a137c7b11ef2f585d7e97e90cf0.png"><br><br>  The new service uses Hyper-V Replica technology introduced in Windows Server 2012 to organize the protection and recovery of Hyper-V virtual machines from one local infrastructure point to another.  At the same time, only the necessary meta-information about virtual machines is transferred to the cloud via encrypted channels, and all data exchange takes place between points of your infrastructure. <br><br>  Since the release of the public preview version in October 2013, the following innovations and improvements have been made to the service: <br><br><ul><li>  improved support for failover; </li><li>  Kerberos authentication support; </li><li>  Support for upgrading from VMM 2012 SP1 to VMM 2012 R2; </li><li>  improved service scaling. </li></ul><br>  You can explore the new features with this <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/manage/services/recovery-services/configure-a-hyper-v-recovery-vault/">walkthrough</a> .

Details of its use from their applications are described in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/201840/">this article</a> . <br><br> <a href=""><img title="image" alt="image" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c0c/07d/360/c0c07d3600b583b043dd6803eebb5e97.png"></a> <br><br>  In the next platform update, Windows Azure Scheduler service was integrated into the administration panel.  Now, creating tasks for a CRON service can be done from a convenient panel in steps. <br><br> <a href=""><img title="image" alt="image" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/53d/068/347/53d068347db71d131405dac797f82623.png"></a> <a href=""><img title="image" alt="image" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/25b/470/58f/25b47058f98a8397eeaae82562bc99a2.png"></a> <a href=""><img title="image" alt="image" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ed/14e/4ee/8ed14e4ee1304034a3c66d172b4e308b.png"></a> <a href=""><img title="image" alt="image" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/488/804/729/4888047294e493652bdbdd4b5251009b.png"></a> <br><br>  The task execution status is displayed on the service page of the administration panel in a convenient way, which allows you to monitor the progress of tasks. <br><br>  Additional Information: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/%3FLinkID%3D328061">Documentation</a> </li><li>  .NET API <a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Management.Scheduler/">NuGet Package</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/azurescheduler">MSDN forum</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/details/scheduler/">Pricing</a> (note the free mode). </li></ul><br><h3>  New Windows Azure Storage </h3><br>  The cloud storage service Windows Azure Storage has received a number of new products and library updates. <br><br>  <strong>Read access to repository copy</strong> .  As you know, the fault tolerance of Windows Azure storage is guaranteed by storing three copies of user data within one data center, plus three more copies of data in another data center if geo-distributed storage is enabled. <br><br>  However, access to these copies of data in the second data center was closed and the backup copies were not available to the user in the usual situation.  With the recent update of the platform, the read access to such a copy of Read-Access Geo Redundant Storage (RA-GRS) has become available to users. <br><br> <a href=""><img title="image" alt="image" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6df/555/6e3/6df5556e38c591ed12998fe48b281100.png"></a> <br><br>  This innovation allows you to get immediate access to your data in the event of a temporary failure in the primary location of the data.  And also allows you to test and track the replication of your data.  To access the data, you can use the corresponding URL in the format <em>myaccountname</em> - <i>secondary</i> . &lt;Service&gt; .core.windows.net. <br><br>  For more information you can refer to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2013/12/04/introducing-read-access-geo-replicated-storage-ra-grs-for-windows-azure-storage.aspx">this article</a> . <br><br>  <strong>New version of Windows Azure Storage Emulator.</strong>  For Windows Azure application developers, a new version of the storage emulator is available with support for <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2013/11/27/windows-azure-storage-release-introducing-cors-json-minute-metrics-and-more.aspx">new</a> storage <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2013/11/27/windows-azure-storage-release-introducing-cors-json-minute-metrics-and-more.aspx">features</a> introduced earlier - CORS, JSON, and others. <br><br>  You can download the new version of the emulator at the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx%3Fid%3D41670">following link</a> .

This update introduced the following new features. <br><br>  <strong>Per-minute monitoring</strong> .  The mechanism of statistics Windows Azure has received a significant update and now offers users to monitor the work of services with a minute interval. <br><br> <a href=""><img title="image" alt="image" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e39/e96/dfe/e39e96dfe911d383be389458d0d73105.png"></a> <br><br>  <strong>Premium SQL Database Metrics.</strong>  The premium edition of the Windows Azure SQL Database cloud database allows the user to have a guaranteed level of performance for their database, thanks to isolation from other users' databases.  In the update of the monitoring services, the CPU metrics and I / O activity for the Premium edition databases were added. <br><br>  In addition, new metrics were added to the update to track storage metrics for both SQL Database Premium and Standard editions. <br><br>  <strong>Containers for storing statistics Web Sites</strong> .  Previously, to configure the web site statistics collection mechanism, you had to select an existing storage blob container. <br><br> <a href=""><img title="image" alt="image" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f20/dd0/49d/f20dd049d320f2dab8cf1897e3323258.png"></a> <br><br>  The update has the opportunity to create a new one and set a separate container for information about the logs and statistics of your sites. <br><br>  <strong>History of Mobile Services operations</strong> .  Thanks to the transaction logging mechanism, administrators and users of a Windows Azure account can track transactions that were performed on objects within that account. <br><br> <a href=""><img title="image" alt="image" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b2/b29/bc1/7b2b29bc109e85a25df20573e86245dd.png"></a> <br><br>  The update has added more than 20 new operations related to working with Windows Azure Mobile Services, which are now noted in the history of operations for further auditing. <br><br>  Notifications about the status of services.  The notification feature (Windows Azure Alerts) allows administrators and users of a Windows Azure account to receive email notifications when certain cloud services running within a subscription are exceeded.  This allows you to be informed in advance about the increase or fall of the load, exceeding the power limits and so on. <br><br> <a href=""><img title="image" alt="image" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f8d/86e/d54/f8d86ed5402c7dd1fa567d38a8ed55d6.png"></a> <br><br>  The update has added support for notifications about the status of the Windows Azure SQL Database service, as well as a significantly expanded set of metrics for notifications about the operation of Windows Azure Web Sites. <br><br> <a href=""><img title="image" alt="image" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3fe/91b/6ae/3fe91b6aeebc0214cef4433345b75530.png"></a> <br><br>  For example, the CPU Time and Data Out metrics will allow you to learn in advance about the exhaustion of the quota of free copies of Windows Azure Web Sites sites. <br><br>  The update also provides support for notifications about the operation of the SQL Database. <br><br> <a href=""><img title="image" alt="image" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ac/1c8/9f6/1ac1c89f6653f665b10d773f4d1c1b2f.png"></a> <br><br>  For the standard database level, you can get information about current storage usage.
