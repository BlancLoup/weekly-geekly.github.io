The court overturned the decision on blocking. <br><br>  Recall that from January 13, seven sites related to Bitcoin were <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/244151/">blocked by</a> Roskomnadzor by the decision of the Nevyansk City Court.  In turn, the court accepted him after the appeal of the Nevyansk city prosecutor with a statement in defense of an indefinite number of persons.  Who cares, here's a more detailed <a href="http://bits.media/news/blokirovka-roskomnadzorom-bitcoin-saytov/">timeline of</a> events. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of these seven sites, btcsec.com and bitcoinconf.ru decided in a judicial proceeding to seek the repeal of this decision.  The situation was also complicated by the fact that all the deadlines for filing appeals had already passed.  It took several months to restore the deadlines and two court sessions.  Materials on this case and the contents of the appeal btcsec.com posted <a href="http://bits.media/sud-po-blokirovkam-bitcoin-saytov-chast-1/">here</a> . <br><br>  In short, the deadlines were restored due to the fact that the interested parties were not involved in the case, and no copies of the court decision were sent to them.

      At the first meeting, the prosecutor's office filed a motion to discontinue the proceedings on our appeal on the grounds that the prosecutor's office did not require blocking access to resources, but only required to recognize the information as non-distributable.  The representative of btcsec.com stated that the blocking of the site is a direct consequence of the recognition of the information posted on the site, which is not subject to distribution, respectively, and btcsec.com is an interested person and can challenge the court's decision.  As a result of the discussion, the court refused the representative of the prosecutor's office to discontinue the complaint and decided to consider the case according to the rules of the court of first instance. <br><br>  At the second meeting, the prosecutor's office filed a motion to waive its demands on the resources that appealed the decision.  At the same time, the remaining resources, according to the prosecutor's office, should have remained blocked.  Representatives of the resources btcsec.com and bitcoinconf.ru voiced the arguments of the appeal and insisted on the cancellation of the decision in full.  As a result of the consideration of the case, the judicial board decided to cancel the decision of the Nevyansk city court.  Thus, the blocking of resources on cryptocurrency in January 2015 was recognized as illegal. <br><br>  In addition to the exclusion of all sites on the case from the Roskomnadzor blocking list, this also means the cancellation of the decision that information about cryptocurrencies, and in particular Bitcoin, is information whose distribution in the territory of the Russian Federation is prohibited. <br><br>  And finally, it is worth noting that thanks to this lawsuit, it was possible to achieve not only the unblocking of sites directly involved in the process, but also the international developer site bitcoin.org and Bitcoin-wikipedia bitcoin.it, which will soon become available again to users from Russia. <br><br>  The administration of the site Bitcoin Security would like to thank: <br><ul><li>  Legal company " <a href="http://www.atplaw.ru/">Tolkachev and Partners</a> " and personally Artem Tolkachev for representing interests in court. </li><li>  Smile Expo companies for the decision not to stand aside and in a court of law to seek the repeal of an illegal decision. </li><li>  Bitcoin Community for all-round support, this is our common victory! </li><li>  Information resources and the media that covered the course of this lawsuit. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/258085/">https://habr.com/ru/post/258085/</a></p>
