In addition, according to the authors of the project, companies with state participation should have the opportunity to purchase equipment from the countries of the Eurasian Economic Union. <a name="habracut"></a>

      In this case, the customer will be obliged to justify the need to purchase foreign equipment. <br><br>  A representative of Rostec, Leonid Khozin, told Kommersant that the corporation is familiar with this project and believes that the proposed restrictions are ‚Äúan effective measure of support for domestic producers.‚Äù <br><br>  However, the Ministry of Communications has its own opinion on the issues of supporting domestic manufacturers.  At the end of December, Megamind <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/22980/">wrote</a> that the agency proposed a mechanism of 15 percent preferences in procurement (competitions, auctions, quotations requests) of state-owned companies, state corporations and natural monopolies. <br><br>  The exemption, according to the <a href="http://regulation.gov.ru/projects">draft</a> Ministry of Communications, should apply to the purchase of 22 items of products.  Among them are electronic computers and communication equipment, monitors and projectors, automatic data processing devices, application and system software (software), IT services, as well as computer manufacturing services. <br><br>  If the state-owned company holds an auction, then in case the supplier wins with foreign goods or services (from the list specified in the draft document), the state customer will enter into an agreement with him.  However, the amount will be 15% less than the final proposal of the supplier.  As conceived by the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media, this mechanism will be used if Russian equipment is similar to foreign equipment and more expensive by no more than 15%. <br><br>  The representative of the Ministry of Economics, Elena Lashkina, <a href="http://kommersant.ru/doc/2913632">told</a> Kommersant that the project developed by the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media is in the ministry and ‚Äúrequires additional study,‚Äù the project has not been received from the Ministry of Industry and Trade yet. <br><br>  Svetlana Apollonova, a member of the coordination council for the innovative development of the radio-electronic industry of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, claims that the measure proposed by the Ministry of Communications will not have any effect: <br><blockquote>  Foreign vendors can very easily play either on temporary price cuts ‚Äúbelow the plinth‚Äù or on long-term installment payments.  From state-owned companies, voluntary switching to Russian equipment should not be expected either. </blockquote><br>  Disagreements between the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Industry and Trade on the import substitution of equipment began in May last year.  Then the Minister of Communications Nikolay Nikiforov sent a letter to Minister of Industry and Trade Denis Manturov criticizing the large-scale import substitution plan in the electronic industry, containing more than 500 different types of electronics and IT equipment, signed by the Ministry of Industry and Trade. <br><br>  Nikolay Nikiforov proposed to exclude from the import substitution plan several dozen types of telecom equipment: switches, routers, base stations and some other varieties. <br><br>  According to instructions issued by President Vladimir Putin at the end of January, the Ministry of Industry and Trade, the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Economy should submit joint proposals for import substitution of equipment no later than June 1, 2016. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298628/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298628/</a></p>
