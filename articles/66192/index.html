We have no more or less employees - as many as 12 people :) <br><br><h2>  What was ‚Äúbefore‚Äù? </h2><br>  4 iMacs, 3 Mac Pros and a few PiSyukovs, on which there was an unlicensed Windows on everyone!  (which I never understood, so why take poppies if I put the Windows on them? Hang up?).  There were also two servers available - one on the server (gateway), the other for Windows 2003 (domain).

    <h2>  What do we need to work? </h2><br>  Because  we have an advertising and web development studio, then, accordingly, the main software that is needed (or rather just expensive) is software for designers (the cheapest package from ad costs about 60K rubles, and there are not all the programs needed for work ). <br><br>  Switch to open source software?  So in the same place, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not convenient to work!‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat if the file doesn‚Äôt open at the customer?‚Äù Or ‚Äúthe customer‚Äôs file will not open at us?‚Äù  After these questions, it became clear that you need to buy licenses for an ad.  And since  we have three designers, and we need three packages, respectively.  And besides, ‚Äúnot the most simple‚Äù, and this is added to an extra penny, which in the conditions of the current crisis is not a very small amount :( <br><br><h2>  What operating system to choose? </h2><br>  Because  we need to run Adobe on at least 3 computers, then the choice is not great - Windows or MacOS.  Because  we have half of the companies in the company - poppies, then the choice has become obvious - the operating system, and even licensed, we already have!  It works perfectly and even a bunch of good programs :) <br><br>  But for the rest of the staff to buy "Windows" also did not want to ... And so it was decided to put MacOS on all the poppies, and put Linux on PiSyuki.  Of the distributions adapted to Russian law and less friendly, Mandriva PowerPack was chosen for workstations (the corresponding licenses ‚Äúwith a reserve‚Äù in the amount of 10 pieces were purchased from LinuxCenter). <br><br><h2>  And what will be on the servers? </h2><br>  There was a question - is a domain needed (here it means Active Directory)? <br><br>  I was looking for an answer to this question for a long time.  And in the end, I realized - not needed.  Of all the charms of AD, our company used only centralized authorization and differentiation of access rights to samba resources on the server. <br><br>  And a significant stone in this garden was the fact that the network was supposed to use only Linux and Mac machines, which with all their desire could not take advantage of all the amenities of Active Directory, although everything works fine with it (as needed). <br><br><h2>  What happened? </h2><br>  And the following happened: <br><ul><li>  on Mac machines, MacOS + was installed on Adobe design packages; </li><li>  Linux Mandriva PowerPacks with purchased ‚Äúpieces of paper‚Äù were installed on the rest of PiSyuki; </li><li>  Linux Debian Lenny was installed on the servers (again with purchased ‚Äúpieces of paper‚Äù) - one of them is used as an Internet gateway (formerly FreeBSD), and the other is used as a file dump and centralized authorization (OpenLDAP was installed and configured on NT-samba) . </li></ul><br>  For office, OpenOffice is used on all computers (for MacOS the NeoOffice assembly is used), for writing NetBeans or Eclipse PDT code (by the way, they work on Macs and Linux). <br><br>  Of the costs were only the following: <br><ul><li>  3 Adobe packages (two "Standart" and one "" packages). </li><li>  Licenses for client Linux machines and two for servers. </li><li>  One license for Windows (you need to somehow look at the sites in IE, and still the sites look different in the same browsers, but under different OS) + set up remote access on it. </li></ul><br><h3>  Pros of the transition </h3><br><ul><li>  Least cost </li><li>  Getting new experience </li></ul><br><h3>  Cons transition </h3><br><ul><li>  There are no full-fledged games (we often played Conter Strike after the working day - for poppies it seems like it is, but it is somehow godlessly buggy). </li><li>  Users have long gotten used (and still get used) to new interfaces. </li></ul><br>  PS The simplest thing was to translate managers (they only need an office and a calculator :), and the most difficult designers are still looking askance at me as the initiator of the ‚Äúaction‚Äù :) <br><br>  <b>Update</b> <br>  At the request of comments, publish approximate tsiferki: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.linuxcenter.ru/shop/licence/lic_debian_5_0/">License for 1 computer Debian 5.0</a> (2 items) - 1900 rubles; </li><li>  <a href="http://www.linuxcenter.ru/shop/licence/mandriva_pp_20091_spring_10pc/">Mandriva Linux Powerpack 2009.1 Spring license for 10 computers</a> - 5,250 rubles </li><li>  Adobe Standart Collection (3 items) - I don‚Äôt remember exactly, but one package got up like 58 thousand.  Total 174 000 rubles; </li><li>  Additionally, there were purchased additional packages from adoba in the amount of about 45,000 rubles. </li></ul><br>  The remaining packages are either insignificant or free counterparts. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66192/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66192/</a></p>
