I want to make a small contribution to the fight against the multi-headed spam hydra. <br><br>  I, like many probably, often receive SMS messages with ‚Äúunloved‚Äù advertising of taxis, loans, fitness centers and other pleasures of life.  And today I came across the service smsnenado.ru <sup>[2]</sup> , which offers to unsubscribe from SMS mailings. <br><blockquote>  <b>% username%, I have nothing to do with this service, I warn you immediately</b> </blockquote><br>  When I saw the repost news about this project - I was skeptical, but curiosity overpowered, and I went to explore. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  On the main page we are offered this option of struggle - <br><ul><li>  Fill out the form and confirm the phone number </li><li>  The service will send a request to the operator to disable distribution </li><li>  When this happens, the server will send a notification email. </li></ul><br>  I incredulously hm and climb in the Terms of Service at the bottom of the form.  And there I saw this: <br>  Conditions are a public offer.  It claims free and non-repayable services for disconnecting me from the SMS mailing.  It is declared that the data obtained "under no circumstances will not be used for the implementation of SMS distribution." <br>  Well, in general, not bad, I thought, and decided to leave a request. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/65c/5c9/94d/65c5c994df99d8ddc2e1fdb34e4fc0b9.png">

      Entered the data - an SMS was sent to the phone with a request to confirm the number by entering the code on the website, so as not to disturb the Operators in vain.  Here a little doubt appeared, but, having checked his account, he confirmed.  <b>So far, the money is in place.</b> <br><br>  Soon the email dropped a message <br><blockquote>  Thank you for using our service.  Your application has been accepted for processing. <br><br>  We will send your complaint to the advertiser requesting to unsubscribe you from the SMS mailing.  If the distributor does not stop sending messages, we will prepare instructions for you and a ready text for submitting a complaint to the prosecutor‚Äôs office.  The complaint is filed through the Internet reception, the procedure takes about 10 minutes.  Your further participation will not be required - the supervisor will deal with the illegal SMS distribution. <br></blockquote><br><br>  Having also investigated the site of the service, I found out that the company that created the service (ZAO VENDOSOFT) is itself a software developer for SMS-sending and creating this service is trying to deal with negligent competitors who break the law. <br><br>  In general, on the project site everyone is popularly told, there is a section with FAQ and feedback.  Well, after reading the section ‚ÄúHelping the project‚Äù, I decided to support the good initiative and write an article on Habr, telling you% about another method of struggle. <br><br>  Hope was useful. <br><br>  <b>UPD: the director VendoSoft found me in vk</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/727/44e/882/72744e88207f43009bd8567e33a58800.png"><br><br>  At his request, post replies to comments: <br><br><blockquote>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/171377/">HangGlider, March 3, 2013 at 00: 25 #</a> <br>  |  we will prepare for you the instruction and the finished text for filing a complaint with the prosecutor's office <br>  illegal advertising by SMS is engaged in FAS.  There are a bunch of instructions on how to do this. <br><blockquote>  <b>Answer:</b> Yes, in accordance with the law, advertising distributed via SMS is administered by the FAS.  But there are a couple of moments: <br>  1) There is no single policy on SMS messages in the FAS, in each region the FAS acts differently - it can be fined somewhere (examples are on smsnenado.ru), somewhere it can be put off on the brakes.  In general, ms <br>  on the part of the recipient of sms mailings, the appeal to the FAS does not guarantee that it will ever be unsubscribed;  On the other hand, appeals to the FAS are not beneficial for SMS senders - they can be fined for this.  Therefore, our service is useful for both SMS senders and SMS recipients. </blockquote></blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/171377/">IllAIR, March 3, 2013 at 01: 04 #</a> <br>  Can anyone tell more about the reverse side of the service?  That is, how they understand that Kredit + (number) belongs to such and such company.  On the basis of what they represent your interests? <br><blockquote>  <b>Answer:</b> First, some of the mailings pass through us.  Secondly, we have agreements with other companies that also send SMS.  Yes, we still can‚Äôt find some of the senders, because  We have not established relations with all SMS senders, and we inform people if it was not possible to unsubscribe them from the list. </blockquote></blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/171377/">L3n1n, March 3, 2013 at 01: 26 #</a> <br>  In most cases, the service will help to disable only the advertising sms of the operators themselves.  But also suggests "why should they?"  You can do this yourself by calling the operator.  The result is the same, and you will not leave your number to third parties. <br><blockquote>  <b>Answer:</b> By SMS operators, we do not mean cellular operators, but companies that send SMS.  These companies have contracts with mobile operators, and OPPOS, in accordance with the Law on Communications, cannot but miss their mailings.  We contact SMS distributors and give them information about the person who wants to unsubscribe. </blockquote></blockquote><br><br><ol><li>  Related articles: <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/157993/">What to do if you are tired of advertising SMS</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/pravo/blog/145768/">What to do if you are tired of SMS advertising?</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/139692/">SMS spam or "You can send!"</a> <br></li><li>  The service itself - <a href="http://www.smsnenado.ru/">SMS is not necessary!</a> <br></li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/171377/">https://habr.com/ru/post/171377/</a></p>
