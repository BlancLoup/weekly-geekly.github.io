  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tanium may become the most expensive cybersecurity startup</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="https://www.tanium.com/">Tanium has</a> become one of the most expensive startups on the security market.  In the final round, he raised $ 120 million from <a href="https://tpg.com/">TPG</a> funds, <a href="http://www.ivp.com/">Institutional Venture Partners</a> and <a href="http://www.troweprice.com/">T Rowe Price</a> , as well as <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreessen_Horowitz">Andreessen Horowitz</a> .  In March, according to the results of the previous round, the company's valuation was $ 1.7 billion.  Now it has more than doubled to $ 3.5 billion. <br><br>  History knows two more similar cases in which cybersecurity companies have managed to attract such a large amount in one round.  In 2009, the Czech antivirus software developer <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVG_Technologies">AVG Technologies</a> received $ 200 million, and last year the American company <a href="https://www.lookout.com/ru">Lookout</a> managed to raise $ 150 million. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Tanium is engaged in protecting corporate networks from cyber attacks.  Investors consider this direction very promising.  According to <a href="http://www.privco.com/">PrivCo</a> , this year, total investments in these kinds of startups exceeded $ 1 billion for the first time in one quarter.

      After high-profile stories of breaking into the network of the insurance company <a href="http://www.3dnews.ru/909090">Anthem</a> and the dating service <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/18778/">Ashley Madison,</a> many firms increased the cost of enhancing protection against hacking.  At the end of 2014, global information security costs were expected to reach $ 71.1 billion, Gartner analysts estimated.  This is 7.9% more than in 2013. <br><br>  However, one of the founders and technical director of Tanium, Orion Hindavi, is not sure that the defense companies themselves are safe.  According to him, investors are still investing large sums in the industry, but now they have ceased to overspend and evaluate not a modern technology, but a market outlook. <br><br>  ‚ÄúA year ago, anyone who offered a beautiful idea could receive funding, regardless of whether he had the opportunity to realize this idea.  Today, many people, especially in the upper segments of the venture community, understand that their funding was redundant and it was often spent only on sales development and marketing, ‚ÄùHindawi argues. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI supported Tanium, because I know that Hindavi is among the elite of the most talented specialists in the field of infrastructure software, there are no more than half a dozen such in the world.  The company offers a communication platform on which to build powerful secure applications.  Its potential can change the approach of American companies to cybersecurity and data management, ‚Äù <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2015/09/04/607478-bezopasnost-tsene">lead</a> Vedomosti's statement by TPG partner of Brian Taylor. <br><br>  The volume of Tanium orders in the second quarter grew by more than 250% compared to the same period in 2014, and the number of projects worth more than $ 1 million from the company more than doubled in the first half of the year.  The current round of financing was quadrupled, and the amount of investment, according to Hindawi, could be increased by another $ 30 million.  Now the company accounts for more than $ 250 million. <br><br>  Developing at such a pace, Tanium has every chance of becoming the most expensive cybersecurity startup. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294220/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294220/</a></p>
