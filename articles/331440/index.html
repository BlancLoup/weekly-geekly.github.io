  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Medici effect or is it possible to cross a peach and melon or Windows and iOs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In Florence, the XV century, the Medici family gathered the most educated and talented people of their time.  Sculptors and poets, artists and scientists, warriors and philosophers learned from each other, destroying the boundaries between disciplines and cultures, creating true masterpieces at their junction.  The phenomenon of the creative combination of the incompatible Frans Johansson called the "Medici effect."  The point is to create something new at the intersection of different ideas, breaking down associative barriers and revealing connections that seem unexpected at first glance. <br><br>  The ‚ÄúMedici Effect‚Äù is described in detail in the book by Johannson.  Those who are too lazy to read the book, I recommend to watch <a href="https://www.investory.pro/ru/video/medichi">this minute video</a> .  The whole essence of the ‚ÄúEffect‚Äù there is quite intelligible and, most importantly, succinctly, communicated. <br><br>  Today we live in an era in which there are more objects for crossing and crossing by orders of magnitude than in the days of the Medici.  On the face of the apparent acceleration of the dynamics of reproduction of interbreeding entities, and the rate of such reproduction increases with each passing day.  From here and today's rampant start-ups.  More recently, the phone was crossed with a camera, and now we are talking about crossing the "photo phone" with a blender, which, in turn, has already been crossed with a microwave. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The areas of intersection breed as an infinite geometric progression.

After all, you can cross anything with anything.  It would seem that this is a klondike for an inventor.  Make lists of successful entities and crush them: Uber and church, car and helicopter, phone and sex, and so on.  The method of such a search for ideas, by the way, Johansson describes in great detail in his book.  But there is no important detail.  And what can not be crossed?  More precisely, <b>that crossing is meaningless or harmful for the creator and the society in which he is located?</b>  Let's argue. <br><br>  Here are a few groups of this "no". <br><br><h4>  1. "Shove nevpihuemoe" </h4><br>  The other day, I participated in the session on Enterprise Architecture issues of our not-so-young company.  Attempts to randomly cross different approaches in pursuit of quick results lead to this result in the Enterprise Architecture. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://hsto.org/web/b57/959/fa3/b57959fa387a4e99a9166e9605e05479.png" alt="image"></div><br>  I think it is not necessary to explain what this approach threatens in practice. <br><br>  Another example of harmful crossings is ideally illustrated by the example of the well-known multifunctional knives. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/57/6a/b0/576ab096915840cf6edabdceda5d8637.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  The conclusion from these examples is as follows: you cannot cross functions whose combination will make it impossible to use the final product.  In the case of entangled enterprise architecture, everything can collapse at one moment if any of the links between any even the most insignificant elements are broken.  In the case of a knife, everything is banal simply - it does not fit in your hand, which means there‚Äôs no point in it. <br><br><h4>  2. Nonsense </h4><br>  It makes no sense to cross identical entities.  Forgive me the sexual minorities, but from crossing a peasant with a peasant nothing will come out.  This simply does not make sense.  Similarly, in other areas.  There is no sense in the intersection of Windows and iOs, Mailchimp and MailGun, Ubera and Gett.  They have the same consumer characteristics.  We will not get anything fundamentally new from such intercourse.  At best, something is exactly the same. <br><br><h4>  3. Danger </h4><br>  Let's talk about the dangerous kind of intersections.  The simplest example of this phenomenon is the crossing of sandals and socks. <br><br><img src="https://hsto.org/web/366/1c3/40f/3661c340ffa6480a935688e6639dff42.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Such an approach is dangerous for the lover of such ‚Äúcomfort‚Äù in clothes.  He simply will not be accepted in society.  And let the trendsetters of modern fashion disagree with me. <br><br>  In the discussion under the video mentioned at the beginning of the article, several distinguished gentlemen gave two excellent examples from the fields of chemistry and physics. <blockquote>  ‚ÄúYou cannot mix concentrated (or hot) solutions of acids and alkalis.  This is an important safety rule, a violation of which threatens a chemist, or just a Krivoruk experimenter, will face serious troubles. ‚Äù </blockquote>  (c) Alex Sol.  As well as <blockquote>  ‚ÄúYou cannot cross the atomic nuclei of some particles with other nuclei or elementary particles.  The consequence of the interaction may be the division of the nucleus and the emission of new elementary particles.  The kinetic energy of the newly formed particles can be much higher than the initial " </blockquote>  (c) Andrey Alekseev. <br><br>  What does this mean for a developer?  Everything as with elementary particles and nuclear weapons, which at first enthusiastically created, and now write volumes of documents regulating general disarmament.  The American NSA and the CIA are developing advanced software for spying on the entire world for general security and world peace, but in practice, minimal code leakage leads to the creation of viruses like the recently sensational Wannary.  As one wise man said, you cannot combine good with evil.  Conclusion, before creating something new by crossing the old one - see if it will kill you.  It should only be borne in mind that such concerns should not inhibit technical progress and automation, replacing the routine human work. <br><br>  So, if: <br><br><ol><li>  Injecting nevpihaemogo in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãintersection will not break the final consumer characteristics and the product can be used, </li><li>  We are not trying to "marry" the same entity </li><li>  We soberly realize that the fruit of the crossing will not explode and will not destroy everyone around; </li></ol><br>  Forward!  We make lists of possible "parents" and move the world forward.  It is possible that the taxi application, which will simultaneously measure your blood pressure and make you an MRI while you are standing on the sidelines, will become another unicorn project. <br><br><h4>  Sources: </h4><br><ul><li>  Frans Johansson.
