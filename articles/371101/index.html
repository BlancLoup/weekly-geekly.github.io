  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Interior Ministry refused to purchase domestic computers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d03/70b/692/d0370b692fe34f078f983f9d1257e931.jpg"><br><br>  Last year, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia announced its intention to take the theoretical part of the driver‚Äôs license examinations for domestic computers running on Baikal-T1 processors.  In the autumn, a tender was announced for the purchase of almost 10,000 such systems (9,348) for 357 million rubles.  Only one company took part in the tender - T-Platform.  A subsidiary of this company, "Baikal Electronics", and engaged in the development of the processor of the same name.  The delivery contractor undertook to make until July 1, 2017.  But, as it turned out, no computer was delivered on time, Vedomosti reports. <br><br>  Shipment of computers on the Baikal platform began only on July 31 of this year.  The winner of the tender then supplied the ministry with 1837 computers for a total of 71 million rubles.  The rest of the PC Ministry of Internal Affairs refused to accept.  After that, the T-platforms decided to file a lawsuit against the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Moscow Arbitration Court.  The requirement for the department - to take the remaining 7511 computers and pay 286 million rubles. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As was to be expected, on December 5, the court rejected the claim, stating that the delivery time was not respected.  In turn, the "T-platforms" are convinced that the reason for the failure to meet the deadlines is the delay in the advance by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  Also, the ministry did not provide the information that the company needed to fulfill the contract.  Similar arguments were considered in the FAS, but here the lack of an advance is not considered a good reason for non-execution of the state contract.

      "T-platforms" offered to settle the case, paying all the fines and penalties for late.  But this option did not fit because a special clause was specified in the contract, which prohibits the acceptance of goods after the expiration of the document. <br><br>  In a normal situation, the state order is ready to work with the contractor even if the delivery was overdue.  With commercial contracts, the situation is different, because if a business plan fails or if it is a lost profit, customers begin to look for another partner. <br><br>  In rare situations, the government customer can take delivery late, but only if it is a small fraction, the balance of supply, not exceeding 10% of the total.  This was told by the manager of one of the major suppliers of IT equipment.  At the same time, he also stated that in the case of a large contract it is better to work with partners, rather than try to solve all the problems on our own. <br><br>  With the previous opinion that with the state customer in case of delay, further dialogue is almost impossible, says another representative of the IT sector, who is familiar with the situation.  The fact is that there is a law on public procurement.  The enforcement of this law is strictly monitored by law enforcement agencies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/965/2e7/412/9652e7412117ed9d4baae56b4de14847.jpg"><br><br>  Some experts familiar with the situation believe that the tough stance of the Ministry of Internal Affairs may be explained by the arrest of the chief designer of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Andrei Nechaev.  He was arrested in October of this year.  "Kommersant" previously stated that Nechaev was attracted "as a suspect in a criminal case of abuse of office, which resulted in serious consequences."  It is worth noting that it was Nechaev who advocated the transfer of the Ministry of Internal Affairs to domestic equipment, and ‚Äúhis position played a role at the time when the Ministry of Internal Affairs formed interest in the computer at Baikaly. <br><br>  "T-platforms", fulfilling the order, made about 10 thousand devices.  The surplus is now in the company's warehouse.  She herself estimates her costs at 15 million rubles, but computers are gradually being supplied to other customers. <br><br>  The processor "Baikal-T1" dual-core.  It was <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/icover/blog/271664/">created by</a> specialists of Baikal Electronics, and is the world's first hardware implementation of the MIPS Warrior P5600 core.  The platform hardware supports virtualization, which is embedded in the processor, which creates the opportunity to use the ‚ÄúSecurity by Separation‚Äù approach.  This, in turn, allows you to organize parallel work of several guest OS at once on a virtual machine.  Well, hardware support for virtualization on the processor makes it possible to increase the degree of protection for systems created on the basis of the platform. <br><br>  Processor shipments started from the beginning of the second quarter of 2016.  Large shipments began in the third quarter of 2016.  Then the developers talked about the possibility of the developer individual configuration of the processor module in accordance with the specific requirements of the customer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371101/">https://habr.com/ru/post/371101/</a></p>
