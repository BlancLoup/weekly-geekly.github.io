  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Security cameras will cover 100% of the urban area</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The peaceful inhabitants are completely unprepared for the fact that their every step is secretly recorded by video cameras, and the police can monitor them in real time.  For example, the Bloomberg agency publishes a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news%3Fpid%3D20601109">story</a> that happened in the town of Middlesbrough (England). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Students at one of the local colleges on Saturday evening celebrated the traditional freshman day.  A crowd of youth dumped into the street.  The festivities were in full swing when one of the drunk teenagers took a pedestal and threw it along the road.  Suddenly, from somewhere above, a strict bass thundered: ‚ÄúHey you, in a black jacket!  Yes you!  Put the cabinet in place! ‚Äù  The whole company froze in confusion, and the embarrassed student followed instructions from above. <br><br>  ‚ÄúA person is shocked when he hears a video camera start talking, but when he sees everyone around him looking at him, he feels remorse and obeys,‚Äù Mike Clark, a spokesman for the Middlesbrough City Council, who commented the decision to install the speakers on the security cameras in the city.  If a citizen dropped a bottle on the asphalt or rides his bicycle too fast, he is immediately pulled down, humiliated and forced to correct his behavior. <br><br>  "Big brother is watching you".  Almost 70 years have passed since George Orwell wrote his cult novel "1984", and now the all-seeing dictatorship is finally beginning to be translated into reality.  Nowadays, the privacy of citizens is carefully monitored as never before.  This trend is particularly pronounced in the UK and the USA.

      For example, on the streets of British cities, there are about 4.2 million spy cameras, that is, one camera for 14 residents of the country.  Every citizen after entering the street comes into the view of cameras on average <b>300 times a day</b> .  The day is not far off when the cameras will cover 100% of the urban area and will record every step of each person. <br><br>  Over the past ten years, the British government has spent half a billion pounds (a billion dollars) on spy cameras.  The image from them goes to the monitors at the police station.  The officer can zoom the image dozens of times by pressing the key and focus on the face of a person standing hundreds of meters from the lens. <br><br>  The widespread installation of video surveillance systems began in the United States after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Even in the smallest towns, for example, in the godforsaken town of Igleville, Tennessee, a local newspaper <a href="http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article%3FAID%3D/20061224/OPINION01/612240350/1008">reports</a> the latest technology spy video system. <br><br>  The police are looking forward to the day when the engineers finally create an effective face recognition technology.  According to their forecasts, this should happen no later than 2016. At about the same time, unmanned aircraft (drones) with video cameras that will patrol the streets of cities and track the movements of citizens should be widely distributed. <br><br>  There are other signs that remind of Big Brother.  For example, in many countries, the police are starting to create global databases with DNA samples of all citizens: for example, in the UK, 3.8 million people have already been collected.  There is a total collection of genetic material in all babies, without exception, and very soon new biometric passports with fingerprints, a scan of the retina and a photo of the face should be put into operation.  After that, the introduction of ID radio chips under the skin will begin, so that the police can quickly and reliably identify citizens using a conventional hand scanner. <br><br>  Weak attempts by human rights defenders and opponents of identification technologies from organizations like <a href="http://www.no2id.net/">NO2ID are</a> not popular in a society intimidated by terrorist attacks.  The inhabitants, apparently, are ready to limit themselves in freedoms, if this is done in order to protect them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4889/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4889/</a></p>
