  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What to wish before the death penalty</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img title="Medieval execution" src="/posts/images/kazn.jpg" alt=" ">  Today I suddenly introduced the situation.  Middle Ages, absolute monarchy, fanatical attitude to religion, persecution of heretics and, of course, an angry, stupid crowd driven by the Pope.  I am sitting in a cell, accused of a terrible crime, well, for example, when he was attached to an icon, he accidentally slapped her with saliva and tomorrow I would be executed for it. <br><br>  This post will be asked three questions.  I conducted a social survey, everyone who was online, I asked these three questions, the results simply exceeded all expectations.  What I expected and what I received was completely different things.  So, in this post you are waiting for the results of this survey, believe it is just a bomb. <br><h1>  What to wish before the death penalty? </h1><br>  Well, I divided the results into categories, the best answers, all the remaining answers, and answers like ‚Äúwhat did you smoke?‚Äù <br><h2>  The best answers to this question. </h2><br><ul><li>  Eat strawberries with cream.  Trite but I would like to do this last. </li><li>  In principle, a piece of cake Napoleon </li><li>  get drunk in the ass </li><li>  half an hour to lie on the ground in the field ... </li><li>  um ... lifelong material support for my family </li><li>  Give the right to choose your own death. </li><li>  a cup of coffee, a cup should be exactly 1.45854557459584589458949549584594 liters and coffee should be an espresso triple brewed without a machine </li></ul><br>  All the other answers were commonplace, such as saying goodbye to relatives and without any special deviations from it.  What is really needed to ask before the execution.  Let's take the situation seriously, asking to cancel or postpone the execution is stupid, the monarch has the right to everything, and in that case he will simply spit on you and watch you wriggle at the stake.  You would not be given an easy death either, the crowd wants bread and circuses, and the executions in the Middle Ages were oh so spectacular. <br><br>  Option to talk with relatives.  Why is this option called the majority, you can take me for a cynic and an egoist, but I think that this is absolutely crazy option.  Imagine how terrible it is to communicate with your relatives, when you know that neither you nor they will see you tomorrow, it‚Äôs just terrible to torment yourself and your relatives, why?  In short, the stupid option is unique.  By the way, among the best options there is an option to lie in the ground, in the field.  Of course, this is a very spiritual desire, but I could not stand this half hour, they would kill me by waiting.  This is also where another useful side of this option opens, contrary to the opinion of all Russian classics and philosophers, in my opinion the break of the heart from expectation and from longing is much better than the lead virgin.

      Eating all sorts of goodies is also a pretty good idea, especially if you have them in front of the crowd with a good, healthy animal appetite, and there is also a great opportunity to choke to avoid ripping off your skin alive and not deliver the crowd of ignorant commoners. <br><br>  Lifetime family support is a good option for a nobleman to be remembered.  The common man‚Äôs desire may not be fulfilled, but here there are more chances that your family will continue to exist afterwards. <br><br>  Getting drunk in the ass is also a great idea, especially if you prefer to die from a lead maiden rather than a heart failure. <br><br>  Well, so far, in fact, everything on this issue.  I was very surprised by the results by the fact that I expected to hear one answer in 50% of cases, but did not hear it even once.  You can understand it as you like, but before being executed, I would like to first wish a tall blonde with a third size breast, then a tall brunette with a second size breast and a medium height brown-haired woman with a first-size breast.  So here <img src="/smiles/smile.gif" alt=":)"><br><h1>  What to say to the crowd before the death penalty </h1><br><img title="Medieval execution" src="/posts/images/kazn1.jpg" alt=" "><br><br>  Really incredibly difficult question, what do they all say?  Here you are standing on the scaffold, you are executed in five minutes, and everyone is waiting for you to say something, and you need to say something memorable special to remember everything, but as a rule, nothing comes to mind at such moments. <br><h2>  The answers I really liked. </h2><br><ul><li>  I love you, pathetic bags of meat </li><li>  I would ask a harmonica and a minute to sbatsat, and I would send the crowd to e *** pits doggy, nefig on death to watch </li><li>  Well.  I would say ... Mmm.  There were many sins in life.  And the sin for which I will hang, was the most erroneous, but the only true, because he stops the chain of sins that I could commit. </li><li>  It was a delicious cake, it is a pity that you did not get A cho, to die duck with laughter, better than sobbing blowing snot </li><li>  <strong>be kinder)</strong> </li><li>  Love </li><li>  <strong>PHP HANDSING THE WORLD !! 11</strong> </li></ul><br><h2>  Other answers. </h2><br><ul><li>  Yeah you all to hell </li><li>  Spectators always need bread and circuses. </li><li>  me poher, let them think: o </li><li>  You all shit </li><li>  Politely silent </li></ul><br>  Well, there were many answers in this style, like you are all shit and so on.  Personally, I do not know what I would say, probably would have stood in a daze or would have fought hysterically.  In general, <strong>PHP SOUTH WORDS !! 11</strong> , this is an option that I liked the most. <br><h1>  How many times have sent. </h1><br>  Yes, in principle, not so much +) <br><ul><li>  b ** crazy?  I still need to add cs&gt; _ &lt; </li><li>  what e ***** I chtoli? </li><li>  Eat less meat, less nonsense will climb in the head. </li></ul><br><h1>  Conclusion </h1><br>  That was such an extravagant post.  Write in the comments, whatever you think about this topic +) I wish you all good health and less such garbage in your head. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/70176/">https://habr.com/ru/post/70176/</a></p>
