  <section class="page js-page"><h1>69 signs that you are not fucking the project, and he you</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  1. Your company began to hire consultants to blame everyone <br>  2. Your server for load testing fell with the error "Everything, b $%, I can no longer!" <br>  3. Your version control system is a set of ‚Äúrevision 1‚Äù, ‚Äúrevision 2‚Äù,: ‚Äúrevision 465‚Äù folders, etc. on a network drive <br>  4. Your TK consists of three pages written 2 hours before the lunch break. <br>  5. You began to look for a new job, because you do not want to support the code that you are writing now. <br>  6. The first phrase in any meeting ‚ÄúThere is good news, there is bad.  Where do we start? ‚Äù <br>  7. Your project progress is now measured by the number of fixed bugs, not the number of implemented features. <br>  8. You made friends with a cleaner <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  9. Your best developer of educational documents has only a certificate of attending a two-month training course for system administrators at the Specialist Center at the Moscow State Technical University.  N. E. Bauman. <br>  10. You are unfamiliar with the abbreviations DRY, LOL, or KISS;  but understand perfectly what WTF or FUBAR means <br>  11. Your supervisor can be replaced by a set of rules for automatic email forwarding. <br>  12. Your development process is ISO 9001/2000 certified (and that's it) <br>  13. Your management believes that Metric is a protein drink. <br>  14. In the bugtracking system, any bug has the priority of ‚ÄúCritical‚Äù <br>  15. And any new feature - the priority of "Trivial" <br>  16. Project costs always magically coincide with the project budget. <br>  17. Developers use the words ‚Äúself-documenting code‚Äù when explaining why there are no comments in their source code. <br>  18. Your favorite design pattern is ‚ÄúObject-Who-Makes-All‚Äù (God Object) <br>  19. You believe that compilation is one form of testing. <br>  20. Developers use vi as IDE <br>  21. You do not have a personal computer at work (and you are not engaged in pair programming). <br>  22. The unspoken rule: do not arrange meetings until 10 am (because we were all here until 2 am) <br>  23. Your team believes that XML is a short-term passion. <br>  24. You are planning to smoothly switch from VB6 to VB.NET. <br>  25. Your boss thinks MS Project is the best project management tool in the world. <br>  26. Your wife sees you only through a webcam. <br>  27. In your unit tests there are no asserts. <br>  28. You are hoarsely arguing about whether you need to put "{" on a new line, and discussions about the use of design patterns like MVC are quick and easy. <br>  29. The phrase ‚Äúeverything works for me‚Äù is heard more than once a day. <br>  30. Your boss insists that you compile detailed progress reports, but never use them to make decisions. <br>  31. Debugging goes on the combat server <br>  32. To impart new vitality to the project, the company arranges team building, where everyone gets drunk. <br>  33. In the morning, the release manager is aware that the developers have informed him of the actual deadline for the project, but is afraid to recall it. <br>  34. The total budget of your project is confused with a weekly bill for coffee. <br>  35. Your boss spends a lunch break in his car (crying) <br>  36. Sellers "Crumb-potatoes", working the night shift, begin to recognize you in the face <br>  37. Developers use a version control system only as a means of backing up sources <br>  38. Developers do not test.  At all. <br>  39. The client constantly accepts the schedule of growth of expenses for the schedule of profit growth <br>  40. The code name of the project was changed to "Kamikaze" <br>  41. Recently, you have a feeling of irrational fear, if you have to answer ‚Äúyes‚Äù to the question ‚Äúdo you do?‚Äù <br>  42. As a reward for processing, the authorities ordered a coffee machine in the office. <br>  43. The budget of your project in the balance sheet moved to the article "Overhead" <br>  44. You secretly outsource a part of a project to read LJ at work. <br>  45. The alpha version of the project has not yet been released, but a change control commission has already been established. <br>  46. ‚Äã‚ÄãYou are considering breaking your fingers so that you can be sent to the hospital. <br>  47. ‚ÄúDeadline‚Äù was renamed to ‚ÄúMilestone‚Äù (like the previous ‚Äúdeadline‚Äù) <br>  48. ‚ÄúOpen door policy‚Äù of your project manager is valid from 19:01 to 9:59 <br>  49. The authorities declare: ‚ÄúYes, what to buy, we will write it ourselves!‚Äù <br>  50. In the evenings you buy pizza, shawarma and adrenaline rush to the office <br>  51. Your boss got caught during a seance (asked for advice on leadership) <br>  52. You give the wrong advice to colleagues to look better at the reporting meeting. <br>  53. Code review starts a week before the product is released. <br>  54. Plans for testing are defined as "If there is time" <br>  55. The client does not want to talk about project requirements without receiving a work plan. <br>  56. The authorities do not see humor in comics about Dilbert (http://www.dilbert.com/) <br>  57. You start to think about whether 12-hour work at McDonald's is more promising from a career point of view. <br>  58. All performance problems are solved by purchasing more powerful iron. <br>  59. The project decided to release in the form of a permanent beta version. <br>  60. The tow truck took your car from the parking lot in front of the office, because it was considered abandoned. <br>  61. During the meetings on the collection of requirements, the project manager leads a pencil on paper, drawing complex geometric patterns. <br>  62. You are doing pair programming alone. <br>  63. The last book on programming that you read is the Bible Visual InterDev 6 <br>  64. You know perfectly well how many compilers should be in order for the 'Out of Memory' error to occur in your IDE <br>  65. In this list, the IDE is mentioned twice, and you do not know how it stands for <br>  66. Non-working unit tests are deleted because they are obviously outdated. <br>  67. In the QA department you were called ‚ÄúMr. Buffer Overflow‚Äù <br>  68. 90% of the time you are all set at 90% <br>  69. ‚ÄúOh, yes, I completely forgot. Mmm .., uh ... you will also need to come on Sunday morning.  Thank." <br><br>  Taken <a href="http://nimdator.livejournal.com/173190.html">here</a> </div>
