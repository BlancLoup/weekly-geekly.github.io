The solution is ideal for use in high-load systems such as social media and cloud services, analytics, and mathematical calculations. <br><br>  Rapid adaptation to these services and their delivery models leads to an increase in demand for data centers, and customers are looking for new technologies that meet these requirements in order to increase efficiency and reduce costs.  At the same time, the main selection criteria are high performance and lowest possible energy consumption.  The NeXtScale platform is the latest addition to the <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/ru/x/">IBM x86</a> portfolio of server solutions, created specifically for running applications that require supercomputer power.  The new platform is based on a flexible, open and easy-to-use architecture that supports the operations of calculating, storing large amounts of data and installing graphic accelerators. <br><br>  NeXtScale System can accommodate up to 84 x86 servers and 2016 processor cores in a standard 19-inch EIA format rack.  The platform involves the use of standard components, including I / O boards and top-of-rack switches, which provides configuration flexibility and quick system adaptation.  IBM also offers a powerful software stack for NeXtScale, which includes the IBM General Parallel File System, GPFS Storage Server, xCAT and IBM Platform Computing, thus providing customers with key tools for planning, managing and optimizing the system.

      The platform allows you to create a single architecture based on open standards, which has high rates of performance and efficiency.  Such a system is able to quickly integrate with customers' data centers, existing practices and other x86 solutions.  NeXtScale will help customers more effectively manage their operations and investment budgets, while providing maximum computing power and substantial space savings.  Thanks to the standard form factor and the use of standard components, IBM partners can offer a platform for high-performance computing to a wider audience of users. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe NeXtScale platform delivers high performance for the most demanding workloads in high-performance and cloud computing or managed hosting services,‚Äù said Kevin Rozynek, NASA Head of Direct Systems Support (IBM Business Partner).  "In addition, the new system provides customers with more opportunities in terms of the flexibility of configuration and configuration of components - in fact, it can do anything." <br><br>  NeXtScale is the perfect solution: <br><ul><li>  For large data centers that require efficiency, high computing density and scalability; </li><li>  For public, private and hybrid cloud infrastructures; </li><li>  For business intelligence applications, for example, customer relationship management, operational optimization, financial risk management, and business modeling; </li><li>  For social networking applications, such as online gaming and streaming video; </li><li>  For high resolution imaging in areas such as medicine or oil and gas production; </li><li>  For ‚Äúsectoral‚Äù use - in cases where a compact solution helps speed up results prediction, engineering calculations, and optimize design and modeling processes. </li></ul><br>  IBM also introduced the x3650 M4 HD server, an advanced version of the x3650 system, which uses a hardware RAID controller with bandwidth support up to 12 GB and also provides a 60% higher data storage density, making the server ideal for working with large amounts of data and mission-critical workloads.  IBM NeXtScale and System x3650 M4 HD are the latest additions to the System x 2-socket server portfolio, which includes rack solutions, as well as Flex System, iDataPlex and BladeCenter servers.  All of these server solutions will use new Intel Xeon E5-2600 v2 processors, which will provide up to 45% more performance *. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/640/2e1/f68/6402e1f6809c0e3c48f91261b58594b8.jpg"><br>  ‚ÄúWith a combination of exceptional flexibility, high performance and efficiency, a standard form factor and a powerful software stack, NeXtScale is a universal solution for the data center of our customers.  This platform is fairly simple in preparation for use, implementation, and deployment, ‚Äùsaid Adalio Sanchez, CEO of IBM System x.  ‚ÄúThe announcement of NeXtScale and other new products and updates reflects our commitment to continuously developing our x86 portfolio of high-performance solutions for our customers.‚Äù <br><br>  NeXtScale supports the industry's fastest x86 processors, as well as high-speed memory modules with a frequency of 1866 MHz.  The platform can be integrated into a data center or used in server rooms, and is compatible with power systems operating at low voltage of 100-127 V. NeXtScale can also be used in data centers with elevated operating temperatures (up to 40 ¬∞ C) - thus, lower requirements for cooling system can reduce operating costs.  The concept of Native Expansion provides users with the ability to add additional features to the NeXtScale platform, such as data storage, graphics accelerators or co-processors, both at the checkout stage and during the operation of the platform.  Also, NeXtScale users have access to basic kits that help configure many industry standard high-performance computing solutions and cloud solutions such as Ansys, MPI-BLAST, and OpenStack. <br><br>  The NeXtScale platform offers IBM business partners a flexible, customized system that is available for ordering in the format of standard solution building parts, which allows partners to add key components and services to create additional capabilities.  This high-performance solution enables business partners to expand their customer base and helps them grow in the fast-growing x86 server market. <br><br>  Featuring special system flexibility, the NeXtScale platform is available for ordering in a single-node configuration, in an empty or configured chassis format, and also as part of a complete IBM Intelligent Cluster solution that has been tested and ready for use.  Choosing the Intelligent Cluster system, the customer receives a solution with all the necessary switching modules and software that has passed the load testing.  This configuration allows you to reduce the time normally spent by the customer on setting up the system by 75% **, while significantly reducing the level of household waste from packaging materials. <br><br>  More information about NeXtScale and other new solutions can be found <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/x/">here</a> . <br>  Photos of NeXtScale and other new products can be obtained by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ibmsysxblade/sets/72157635367684730/">following the link</a> . <br><br>  NeXtScale Platform Video: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/yIkf3KT5_E4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgU1RmUGQqyq-Zl4DfAa8fmOCxMkg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Video with the description of the server x3650 M4 HD: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/BxnqnB7FgFU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhje25jBl3zpxnFT5qHehWW0SkxESQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  * (E5 v2 New Generation Java * Performance) Basic configuration and results of server java benchmarks: Intel Server Board S2600CP platform with two Intel Xeon E5-2690 processors (2.9 GHz, 8 cores, 20 MB L3 cache, 8.0 GT / s, 135 V, C2-stepping), 128 GB of memory (16x8 GB DDR3-1600), RHEL 6.2.32, Oracle Hotspot 1.7.0_21-b05.
