      I do not like standard resumes.  But objectively I understand that you most likely do not know anything about me, and this gap needs to be filled.  Therefore, I will write an unusual summary.  Summary article. <br><br>  Pour tea or some coffee, we have a longrid here. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Roles </h4><br>  For many years of work in IT, I realized that it‚Äôs more interesting not to list the companies in which a person worked, but the roles that he performed.  And what success in these roles he has achieved. <br><br>  I was on the following roles and functions: <br>  1. 1C programmer; <br>  2. js programmer; <br>  3. team leader; <br>  4. project manager; <br>  5. CIO; <br>  6. business programmer; <br>  7. writer of texts; <br>  8. product manager; <br>  9. strategist; <br>  10. partner in business. <br><br>  I'll tell you more about each of the roles. <br><br><h4>  1C programmer </h4><br>  This is a role that I did not part with from the first day of my work activity.  Whatever I do, I always programmed on 1C.  Just a little bit. <br><br>  I love 1C and program on it.  I sincerely believe that 1C programmers are the most underrated type of people.  But this does not prevent me from loving, for example, javascript.  I‚Äôve been out of the age of holivars long ago, and I understand that there is a solution for each task. <br><br>  So, do not be distracted ... I am a very good 1C programmer.  Not to be confused with coders, architects and other evil spirits.  Programmers 1C is almost gone in the world, and it's time to put us in the Red Book for a long time. <br><br>  A 1C programmer is a person who understands a business task without a technical task, functional requirements and other bureaucracy.  As my mother-in-law accountant said about such "I have not yet finished speaking, but he is already there sausage."  Business users of such programmers adore, if they are given to work directly, without the mediation of an effective manager. <br><br>  What I just did, being a 1C programmer.  Implemented SCP at large factories when working in franchisee 1C.  Created my configurations.  I modified a typical UPP for 1C (if you have it installed, then my code is there).  I wrote a bunch of subsystems - planning, procurement management, sales, CRM, strategic indicators, task management, cost management, cost exploration, MDM, working with third-party web services, etc.  Simply put, almost everything that is in this 1C is. <br><br>  There are several generally accepted hits by which you can evaluate my decisions.  For example, the cost structure, which sold thousands of copies.  Nothing more decently in terms of cost overruns has ever appeared.  Or take data verification - the best tool for ensuring data quality.  Or the same task - a fundamental new approach to automation control.  Or read the description of the subsystems of the bottle. <br><br>  In general, it is easier to list what I did not do there.  I worked a little with retail.  I don't know all the ticket offices there.  The theme, though HYIP, but somehow not programmer, or something ... <br><br>  I have a copyright approach to automation, called customization on the fly.  There is an article of the same name on this topic - read it if you want.  The essence is simple: I create universal tools that allow you to quickly solve a certain class of problems.  For example, checking data when writing reference books / documents.  Programming each check is added in half an hour, and through the tool in a couple of minutes.  Tools such I created pieces 30-40.  The above mentioned tasks and data verification also apply to them. <br><br><h4>  Js programmer </h4><br>  The role is relatively new for me, but it is worth mentioning - all of a sudden it matters to you. <br><br>  I understood the programming language myself and fell in love quickly enough.  Especially after 1C, it breaks the brain straight - where has it been seen that the function is a property?  Yes, in 1C with such capabilities, we would have turned the mountains! <br><br>  But I can‚Äôt call myself a direct js programmer because  I did not have time to understand the related technologies that are not easy after 1C.  For example, I do not know how webpacks work.  That is, I will write the code, but I don‚Äôt know where to put it. <br><br>  The point, of course, is fixable, just little experience. <br><br><h4>  Timlider </h4><br>  One of my favorite roles.  In this position I have achieved particular success. <br><br>  The main thing: I learned to build effective work.  Sounds, of course, as a standard phrase from a standard resume.  But I have the numbers: efficiency increased 4 times.  Right like this - the programmers under my leadership do 4 times more work for an identical period of time. <br><br>  It's not about me, but about the technique.  I have mixed Scrum, Theory of Constraints, boundary management, statistical process control, space planning, methods of the Roman Catholic Church, Genghis Khan, Belbin, controlling and a whole bunch of other things, including my own. <br><br>  From each technique took the best.  And only what works, i.e.  really increases efficiency.  Everything is messed up. <br><br>  Since then, I can not pass without tears by those who "we work on Scrum", or "we stopped at DevOps", or "best practices - Kanban."  Not if you like to work at low revs, but to have in your hands a beautiful flag and a certificate - for God's sake. <br><br>  In real life, none of us lives by any one method.  They sleep on one, eat on the other, communicate with the children on the third, and ride the fourth one on the bike.  And in the sum the happy life turns out.  And it suits everyone.  Why at work to arrange this circus?  Is that the food respected consultants. <br><br>  I have long doubted my method, because no one was willing to implement it at home.  And recently, someone took.  And got similar results.  Even the money rooted.  So there is no doubt anymore. <br><br>  The technique is quite formalized - I even wrote half books about it, somehow, on occasion, I‚Äôll finish it.  There is no process and requirements - just a set of tools suitable for specific situations. <br><br>  So, if you want to see me as your team leader, know what I will do - increase the efficiency of the team.  That she gave the result faster. <br><br>  Well, yes, I can work with people.  I talk to them, I can find a common goal, which includes private and personal.  I understand the differences in psychology, and I will not force the contractor to generate ideas, and the generator of ideas to write reports. <br><br>  The main achievement, probably, is the opinion of the guys from the team: we want to work with you.  Even if you do not like the company in which it happens. <br><br>  Of course, they are ready to work with it.  With all my heart and with all the diligence.  Experiment, try new approaches, develop, learn technology, delve into the business of dirt.  They understand why. <br><br><h4>  Project manager </h4><br>  I do not really like this role, because  I enter into a rage and very fond of.  Especially when the goal is clear. <br>  For example, there was such a project - to put a warehouse in order.  Accounting was a curve, up to half of the warehouse turned out to be in deviations according to the results of the inventory.  The goal is simple - reduce deviations to 5%.  I got so carried away that it reduced to 0.1%. <br><br>  The project was complex - such are much more interesting.  I programmed there, rewrote processes, invented a system of motivation and fines, and settled political schemes. <br>  But if in general, then project management by flexible methods is close to me.  Again, not "we manage projects for Scrum", but a sensible mix of methods that produce results. <br><br>  Somewhere I am tough, especially in terms of data quality control, if required by the project.  I work with the list of tasks extremely clearly and formally, but people like to arrange a parade of hotelok, splashing out negatives and chewing snot.  Tasks are ranked as clearly as possible, according to several criteria - for example, by value for the next release. <br><br>  He even invented his own method, on the basis of flexible ones, called ‚ÄúRuns‚Äù.  I haven‚Äôt spoken anywhere yet, because she hasn‚Äôt got any form yet.  Allows you to conduct several projects at the same time, reducing what fashionable guys call time to market. <br><br>  In short, in project management, I focus on the business result, and not on smearing the snot on the budget.  Extremely fast, but without loss of quality.  And releases more often. <br><br>  Well, 100,500 times convinced of the correctness of the Pareto principle.  No matter how hard you try, no matter how much you veil, but still the result is ensured by 20% of the work, and 80% - unnecessary garbage. <br><br><h4>  CIO </h4><br>  One of my favorite roles.  I have been in it for several years. <br><br>  When you read a summary of IT directors, you fall asleep on the third line.  They list some technologies, software products, entirely in English, which they successfully implemented.  And who the hell will write when it helped the business. <br><br>  And when you ask directly about the benefits to the business, they look like they are crazy.  Our goal, they say, is IT infrastructure support.  But, guys, let me ... IT infrastructure support is the goal of system administrators.  They are excellent, very intelligent guys who know their business perfectly.  It was from their resume that you wrote off all your clever words in English. <br><br>  The main goal of the CIO is business development with all available means.  Actually, like any other director. <br><br>  Support - it goes without saying, how to brush your teeth in the mornings and evenings.  To be proud that the entire IT infrastructure is working, of course, is possible, but only if it was lying on its side before you. <br>  I am a bad CIO.  So would say any other director who worked alongside me.  Only the owner considered me a good CIO. <br><br>  Because I did not give anyone peace.  It is not enough for me to know which process should be automated.  I need to know the process.  And find out why he is so clumsy.  And even improve it.  Yes, I do not need to know - I myself will come and say that the process is bad.  Especially if it spoils the life of other processes. <br><br>  I will offer a comprehensive solution for change - and the process, and motivation, and purpose, and management system, and, like the cherry on the cake, automation.  Of course, if a person wants to develop his department. <br><br>  And then, after all, a lot of managers, for whom the main thing is to sit on the spot.  The development of such contraindicated, the main thing - to save their power. <br><br>  If the chief accountant asks me for the support of his employees by programmers, I automate routine operations, establish data quality control and track metrics by data entry time, in order to fire a couple of accountants at the end. <br><br>  If the purchasing director asks me to add a check mark to the order, I introduce a system for calculating needs with personalization of support tasks, and now at each particular second it is known who performs their duties normally and who just came to sit.  As a result, by the way, it turned out that a young, new employee works best of all, and two old mothers of suppliers provide a kick. <br><br>  The more an IT director looks at tasks, the better.  So I decided for myself.  True, he ceases to be a CIO, and turns into not understand who.  Something like a development director.  Or a business programmer. <br><br><h4>  Business programmer </h4><br>  I myself coined this term.  The meaning is this: this is a person who changes business as a system. <br>  I became a business programmer when I was a CIO.  And I remain a business programmer to this day.  Maybe you will be so. <br><br>  There is a programmer in the world.  It changes the information system.  Every day makes some changes to it.  Sometimes - on someone's task.  Sometimes - at their own discretion. <br><br>  For example, he sees that in a certain place the system slows down, fails, does not allow processes to go at a normal speed.  It includes debugging, measuring performance, finds the cause of the brakes and eliminates it.  Normal such work, which, as a rule, no one notices. <br><br>  So, you can do the same with ordinary business processes.  Here, for example, is the sales process.  It starts with the customer's call, ends with the receipt of money on the current account, if we have postpay. <br><br>  A business programmer is looking at this process, and he understands - yeah, trouble!  Three months from a call to money.  Nightmare. <br><br>  And it works just like a programmer.  Looks at the whole chain from the beginning to the end, with measurements, a photo of the working day and data analysis.  Yeah, I found - serial products, but they are not always in stock, the customer has to wait.  It is necessary to form and maintain a buffer, according to the Theory of Constraints. <br><br>  Decided and did.  Automated, made changes to the supply process - to buy not only at the request of customers, but also to replenish the buffer - and voila, the customer calls, and in an hour his order is already assembled. <br><br>  Or another case - IT service.  Too long from the appearance of the customer's request to the payment.  A business programmer is looking, and he sees that there is not enough banal regular management.  A person accepting applications for work looks at them once every two days.  We put it on the counter, add a metric, or any SLA - and everything, as pretty for an hour takes. <br>  We look further - the task is in the priority, but the programmer does not.  We understand why.  If the system is just a curve, and allows it to sort the list by itself, we change it, because freedom of choice is destructive.  If a programmer thinks too much about himself, then we define a metric for him - following the order.  And we bring in the motivation system - do it in the order you like, but with a discount. <br><br>  Principle you understand.  Not easy to analyze as a business analyst.  Do not just perform the tasks as a programmer.  Do not work with one part of the business system, such as automation, motivation, processes, etc., and with all at once.  Act on the lever that will quickly lead to the result, and not on the one that is closer, clearer or more accessible. <br>  So, I am a business programmer.  True, on one condition - if they allow it to me.  And if they do not allow, I try to achieve this.  Well, there, as it goes. <br><br>  Yes, I turned business programming into a science.  I wrote and continue to write about methods, practices and cases.  You never know, suddenly someone else wants to go on this path. <br><br><h4>  Text writer </h4><br>  On this role, I was quite by accident.  Just at some point, about two years ago, I decided to write a couple of articles, and then I went. <br><br>  At first I just wrote what was going on and how, without any purpose.  But gradually, over time, I understood the power of this tool - the texts. <br><br>  For most people, writing a text is a dreadful, unpleasant, difficult task.  Code write - please.  Release release - easy.  And to write the text about this code, release or product - no, thank you. <br><br>  As a result, the product is created alone, and the text - others.  Inevitably there is a deaf phone and, as they say on the Internet, "marketer detekted". <br><br>  A bunch of useful products that disappear into obscurity, because the text about the curve is written about them, if at all.  A lot of smart people creating masterpieces are wasted because they cannot express their thoughts in the form of letters. <br><br>  And the most unpleasant - millions of faceless company sites, with the same texts like ‚Äúpeople are our main asset‚Äù, dead news sections and horrible pages about corporate life at kindergarten level (‚Äúoh, look, we collect garbage!‚Äù ‚ÄúHurray, we brought a new transformer!‚Äù Or ‚ÄúLook, we went to the conference!‚Äù). <br><br>  So, I mastered writing texts well.  I can write technical articles, instructions and descriptions of programs and services.  I can write entertaining articles promoting these very products and services.  I can write something like hudlita.  I can write moralizing.  I can write news.  In short, I can write almost everything. <br><br>  It is clear that I am far from professionals, any copywriters or bloggers.  But there is a difference - I am an IT person, and I continue to be one.  For me, writing texts is an auxiliary tool.  He promotes products, company, methods, well, me sometimes.  I write, roughly speaking, in between times, when a minute is given.  Well, when it is useful for the cause. <br>  I included writing texts in the resume simply because other friends, as a rule, ignore this skill.  Although he, like, useful. <br><br>  There are formal achievements.  I write on two platforms - InfoStart and Habr.  At Infostart I am in the first place in the rating, on Habr√© I swim, I get to the second (there the rating decreases with time).  So, just in case I mentioned, all of a sudden it matters to you. <br><br><h4>  Product manager </h4><br>  The role for me is relatively new, but progress is good.  I lead the creation of products for less than a year. <br><br>  The first product was, in fact, the site (link is in the profile).  My business partner made the technique, I filled the site with content.  There is something to read, there are services - task management and life management. <br><br>  Task management was my second product.  As I mentioned in the ‚ÄúTimlider‚Äù section, I have a task management technique that significantly increases work efficiency.  A part of this technique is completely realized by technical means, which is reflected in the product.  True, I did not have time to launch it to the masses. <br><br>  Life management has become the third product.  This is a cool service that allows you to manage your balance in life by registering activities.  There was only one article about him, but we quickly got about a thousand users.  Then one sensible programmer made a mobile application with the same logic and, like a good person, gave a link to my article.  I may still develop this product - there are a lot of plans for it.  Personally, he greatly changed my life. <br><br>  Then there was a 1C product called Flowcon.  This thing straight money began to bring, and I did it myself.  For 4 months, we sold 16 subscriptions, there were several releases, and the prospects were the most bright.  And all this - without advertising, sales managers, demonstrations, etc.  Only texts. <br><br>  There was, or rather, there is another product, but I can‚Äôt talk about it, because NDA.  But it is so cool that it still throws a shiver - could I really think of such a thing? <br><br>  Yes, there is still body-math.com.  Do not follow the link, there is nothing there.  I invented and checked on myself how you can lose weight without dieting, fitness, pills and dietary restrictions.  Pure engineering approach, machine learning and common sense.  I will finish this project. <br><br>  I repeat, all this - in less than a year, by two people.  With that, we also earned money, with ordinary projects and services. <br><br>  I will not call myself a decent product manager - there is little experience.  But he is. <br><br><h4>  Strategist </h4><br>  It sounds beautiful, in fact - nothing special.  I just had to manage the strategic change of the company as a whole twice in my life.  Both times, the rope, alas, suddenly broke off. <br><br>  There are two pillars in strategic development: the goal and the principles. <br><br>  First, it is necessary to articulate as clearly and clearly as possible the purpose of the changes - what the company should become. <br><br>  In the first case, it was an increase in sales.  I don't remember exactly - 2 or 3 times. <br>  In the second - the sale of products and services with self-service (to be sold and worked without our participation, because we are few). <br><br>  When the goal is chosen, it is necessary to formulate the principles of movement towards it.  At this point, usually it would be desirable to write not principles, but concrete measures and projects ‚Äî it is better not to do so.  Because very quickly, an understanding of the connection between actions and goals will be lost. <br><br>  Principles serve as a link between goal and action.  For example, to increase sales there were such principles: an increase in the passage (in TOC) and the number of supply chains.  For the sale of services, the principle is even simpler: to devote all free time to the development and release of services. <br><br>  Then come up with events, projects, tasks, etc.  But, since there is a principle, it is always possible to evaluate the expediency of an event. <br><br>  Offer to develop a new product?  Well, corresponds to the principle of increasing the number of supply chains.  But at this particular moment contradicts the principle of increasing the passage, because  there and so not overflowed.  So get in line. <br><br>  The client turned, wants a project implementation?  Alas, friend, not destiny - you will delay the achievement of the strategic goal for at least a year. <br><br>  The chief accountant wants to introduce some kind of reconciliation act management service?  Does not correspond to any of the principles, alas.  Moreover, the passage also reduces because  people directly involved in sales will be distracted by some sort of nonsense. <br><br>  The first strategy was implemented successfully, but not for long.  A new director came and said that he himself would lead the strategy. <br><br>  The second strategy was implemented for a long time and not very successfully, because  at the very beginning there was a mistake - not everyone agreed with the goal.  Therefore, the strategy periodically stalled, but still crawled.  If the goal is wrong, then you can not waste time. <br><br>  A smaller strategy had to implement hundreds.  Just like you.  Every product, project, task, person, etc.  there is a strategy, just nobody calls it that way.  And this text has both a strategic goal and principles.  I will not tell just what. <br><br><h4>  Business partner </h4><br>  And, finally, the most recent experience.  For two years I was a two-person business partner. <br><br>  The most interesting thing for me in this experience is the possibility and the need to deal with everything in a row.  This was not on any of the previous roles.  Especially considering the fact that there were two of us, without subordinates. <br><br>  Actually, it is necessary to work - to program, implement something from clients, solve their problems, provide support, answer questions, etc. <br><br>  It is necessary to do something with sales - to write texts, create communities, correspond, talk, demonstrate, etc. <br><br>  We need to somehow control the cash flows so that we don‚Äôt stay without pants. <br><br>  It is necessary, with grief in half, to implement the company's development strategy. <br><br>  It is necessary to increase the efficiency of everything that comes handy - programming, working with texts, solving customer problems, etc. <br><br>  We must constantly think about the future.  No, not so ... We must constantly worry about the future, because there is no one else. <br><br>  But the main thing - you need to be aware of the responsibility.  This is probably the key difference from hired work.  Do not work - no money.  You work - there is money.  Although it happens that you work, but there is no money. <br><br>  Actually, everything that I did in the role of a business partner is written above - products, services and the strategy that gave rise to them.  In general, the experience was damn useful, but remained unfinished - it was not possible to achieve the strategic goal, which makes me extremely sad. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  I did not mention a couple of IT roles that I implemented.  For example, I was once a system administrator.  But, firstly, it was a long time ago, and secondly, I no longer claim this role. <br><br>  But the main thrill, of course, is not in specific roles, but in their mutual penetration.  The more positions I took, the better I understand and carry out each of them. <br><br>  Only having been a CIO, I understood the mistakes of myself a programmer.  Only after working as a business partner, I realized how poorly I understood business as a CIO.  Having created my first products, I understood how to do projects.  Having written hundreds of articles, I realized why programmers do not dare to call a client for hours.  Only after successful teambuilding, I managed to become the leader of changes in the company.  Only due to business programming I know that in any company of our country there is something to do. <br><br>  And in what role I need you, decide for yourself.  I am interested in each.  And I still bring in the particles of the rest, if so will be more effective. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/450058/">https://habr.com/ru/post/450058/</a></p>
