      If you think we are already living in the world of the future. <br>  Nowadays, new ideas can be implemented at the very moment when they came to your head. <br>  If you are single, you can meet a girl online and be on a date in a couple of hours. <br>  If you do not have food in the refrigerator, you can find a quick part-time job using any of the freelancing sites.  If you want to send everything to hell, you can now take a ticket to India. <br>  If you have a business idea, then within an hour you can make a website on any constructor you like, start advertising, and get happy buyers the next day. <br><br>  Nowadays, 25-year-old millionaires who have traveled over half the world and are running their business empires are sipping martinis on a Vietnamese beach.  But there are few of them, because making money out of thin air is a special unique talent.  However, their lifestyle creates a trend that forces thousands of people to start their business right off the bat in the hope that it will multiply and multiply in a couple of months and conquer the universe.  This leads to the formation of a strange community, which consists of a heap of serious bearded uncles who are constantly trying to get something in credit under the promise of a happy future. <br><br>  Investors, we promise a multiple increase in investment in exchange for quick money.  To customers, pieces of code that in the future will become a great startup in exchange for $ 30 per hour.  We promise girls a happy, comfortable life in the future in exchange for moral support in the present. <br>  And Indian yogis promise us deliverance from worldly problems in exchange for the fact that we will spend honestly earned $ 30 per hour in the stores of their country. <br><br>  To say that now no one does not produce anything stupid, because it is not.  However, the number of words sold is far ahead of the number of goods shipped. <br>  This is because modern it technologies have given us wonderful tools for exchanging words, but still there are not enough tools that could just as quickly turn words into actions. <br>  As an example, in order to create an online storefront you need to dig deeper for a couple of days with an opencard.  To start advertising you need to spend a week on a good context (with the ability of course) <br><br>  But to make a really working store take significantly more time and effort.  Agree with suppliers, find and rent a warehouse that would be ideally suited to the requirement of storing goods, hire a storekeeper if you don‚Äôt want to do this yourself, conclude agreements with couriers (if you don‚Äôt want to carry goods by your own car).  You will need to quickly learn many things, because without proper knowledge in economics you will periodically start flying away to a particular minus in a bad season, without proper knowledge in logistics you will start to get confused in picking items during peak seasons.  Time for all this takes a hell of a prorva and for frequent it is not at all like what you imagined at the very beginning. <br><br>  This dissonance between seeming simplicity and not at all seeming difficulties leads to the closure of most businesses in ecommerce, unwarranted expectations, merged money, problems in families and tragic start-ups. <br><br>  It was in order to combat unjustified expectations that it was decided to create a full-operator <a href="http://landing.yamboks.ru/">Yambox, the</a> main goal of which is to make the online store's logistics to fly at the same speed as the start-up thought. <br><br>  Now you can spend a day on something that would dig deeper from the opencard a week on what to set up advertising (of course if you know how) and attention !!!  one day for everything else. <br>  We do not pretend to originality and do not want to say that we are just so smart, of course in the post-Soviet space there is also a handful of complete operators.  I just brazenly declare that we are the coolest. <br><br><h5>  <b>What are we doing?</b> </h5><br>  As you probably already understood, we help the owners of online stores to live a happy and carefree life without thinking about such boring things as: <br><ul><li>  Acceptance and processing of orders </li><li>  Warehouse storage, equipment, packaging </li><li>  Work with courier services and AfID </li><li>  Acceptance and processing of payments </li></ul><br>  If you cooperate with us, all you have to do is to force the client to click on the ‚Äúbuy‚Äù button on the website and fill out the order form, everything else, if you want, will not be noticeable for you. <br>  In fact, in order to make it look imperceptibly, we did a break through the work. <br><br><h5>  <b>Little about logistics</b> </h5><br>  First of all, like any logistics operator, the basis of our business is warehouse logistics. <br>  Therefore, the first thing we did was get confused by the device and the automation of the warehouse.  Our warehouse is located in the city of Vidnoe and its location has 2 main advantages: <br><br><ol><li>  It is close to Moscow, which reduces the cost of transportation for Suppliers. </li><li>  Rental prices in the city of Vidnoe are much lower, therefore, having a large warehouse complex, we have no problems with its payback and, as a result, we can maintain the lowest prices on the market objectively.  For example, the whole complex of logistics, including the acceptance of goods, storage, packaging and packaging, costs our customers an average of 78 rubles per shipment (unless of course they are engaged in the sale of Indian elephants in bulk). </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e7/1a0/267/6e71a02670cb493a8b8bdfcbdab88d78.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  All this allows our customers to save a lot.  Take for example the most common type of online store with an average of 100 orders per month and for example it sells women's dresses, the cost of our services for such a client will be <b>7,800</b> rubles per month.  To understand what the benefits are, just count the cost of renting the smallest warehouse in the Moscow region and add to this the salary of one Dzhamshut and do not forget about the depreciation of warehouse equipment. <br><br>  By the way, we don‚Äôt really strongly dump our warehouse complex that processes 100 units of goods per minute, so the operational processes are much cheaper for us. <br><br><h5>  100 pieces of goods 0_o How do we not confuse all this? </h5><br>  Well, first of all global bar coding.  We glue the barcode literally to everything that comes to our warehouse, (sometimes we get carried away and we blot it on customers, we pack them and send them to Vladivostok with Russian Post).  But seriously, over the course of our work we have developed a sophisticated wms which controls everything that can be controlled. <br><br>  After the goods arrive at the warehouse, all its parameters are entered into the system: weight, volume, configuration and packaging properties, various notes from the client.  The system then selects the correct cell for each product.  The correct cell is the right-sized cell located so that the picker would need to make as little movement as possible to complete your order. <br><br>  When an order arrives to us for processing, (by the way, this is done fully automatically when wms is integrated with your store), the system builds a route picker on which he will move collecting the order. <br>  When picking orders for large volumes of shipments, the human factor is extremely dangerous, so we made it so that the picker could not take any goods from the shelf until he scanned his bar code and if he suddenly made a mistake, the system simply will not let him put the goods on the cart. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/691/a4b/58b/691a4b58b3294eac90ef73dcf61cc36d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The second time, the complete set of all goods is checked in the packing area, when the packer takes the order for processing, he also has to scan the barcode of each item, so he checks the correct set and receives instructions on packaging.  After he collects the goods in the box, he again glues the appropriate barcode on the packaged goods, which contains all the information about the delivery service, the client‚Äôs address and the amount to be paid.  After that, the order goes to the dispatch area, where it is checked once again for the correct packaging and only after that it is sent to the delivery service. <br><br>  And we have a terribly harsh personnel policy. <br>  The time of all processes is clearly calculated, and if one of the employees begins to blunt, then we simply dismiss this employee.  Our storekeepers are walking bio-robots who are afraid to run to the toilet without the permission of our large automated brother.  This is not something that would be cool from the point of view of humanism, but as they say, ‚ÄúIt is more expensive‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5f8/7f7/bae/5f87f7bae1024ba49d0aee25d7451305.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Biorobot Alexander at work. <br><br><h4>  <b>Delivery</b> </h4><br>  We all know that the main delivery operator in the post-Soviet space is the Post of Russia and it was undoubtedly created by the devil, it‚Äôs hard to do anything about it, but we managed to do something. <br>  We managed to make sure that the post office of Russia is located right in our warehouse.  If you visit our complete center then having passed through the goods acceptance area and looking back to the left you can see these harsh hard-working people fenced off from the world of mere mortals with an iron wire wall. <br><br>  This neighborhood can guarantee our customers that their goods will be accepted for delivery by Russian Post immediately after it has been packed in a box.  In addition, our programmers are always aware of the currently relevant interaction protocols, which have the sneakiness to change frequently. <br><br>  Of course, except for everyone‚Äôs beloved Russian Post, we also work with a variety of delivery services, each of which has its own characteristics and its own tariffs.  This is a whole world full of wonders and horrors, the description of all the features of the work with delivery in the format of this article is meaningless, so I will say only one thing, our gene, Natalia Sukhova, leads endless bloody wars for lowering tariffs and reducing delivery times.  Here is this heroic woman who made delivery for our customers on average 20% cheaper than if they worked with couriers directly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a20/487/487/a204874878af44f0892f6f5cda15cf51.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, it is worth noting that we do not earn on delivery, all tariff wars are conducted only so that our customers are happy. <br><br>  We can talk about warehouse logistics for a long time.  However, I am afraid to tire you, so let's talk a little about how we work with clients.  It is worth saying one important word - we work quickly.  That is, from the time you left the application on the site, it takes one day to receive your goods at the warehouse (unless of course you need to think a week).  This is achieved by the simplicity and clarity of the contract, the lack of hidden payments and smart sales managers who are trained in warehouse processes and can not hesitate to describe what will happen to your product from entering the warehouse to handing to the end customer. <br><br>  And finally, the most important thing.  We really want to work with you!  If this is mutual, then immediately go to the <a href="http://landing.yamboks.ru/">site</a> and leave a request. <br><br><hr><br> <a href="http://landing.yamboks.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d6/bc3/397/4d6bc3397f084a76859f03d0ac303610.png" alt="image"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302986/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302986/</a></p>
