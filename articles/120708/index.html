Recall the order of introduction of new functions from the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/Dura_Lex/116478/">previous publication</a> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/5f/77/5f774868f4dbe293dd3df2bdf24a27ea.png">  Run interactive reports; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/5f/77/5f774868f4dbe293dd3df2bdf24a27ea.png">  Registration implementation; <br>  Adding a general taxation system; <br>  Adding information for legal entities; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/5f/77/5f774868f4dbe293dd3df2bdf24a27ea.png">  <b>Implementation of electronic reporting;</b> <br>  The implementation of the payment of contributions and taxes. <br><br>  Leaving filling the base with new types of taxation and economic activity for later, we decided to implement one of the most convenient features of the site as soon as possible: delivery of electronic reporting online.

      So, we are pleased to announce that Taxer will allow conveniently, without leaving the site, send the next quarterly report to the tax. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h1>  Preface (passable) </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/43/1a/431acc38383a1c71bb988b0853762d5c.png" align="right">  The opportunity to submit reports in electronic form exists not the first year and has already managed to undergo several evolutionary stages.  At the very beginning, entrepreneurs could report using the free program OPZ, developed in the depths of the tax itself.  Later, the submission of reports in electronic form obliged all large and medium tax payers, and someone naturally decided that further such a potentially large market niche could not remain untapped.  In 2009, the state submitted a special operator: everyone who wanted to appear less in the tax department had to send reports to the gateway of this monopoly.  The services of the special operator were paid and imposed.  For a long time it could not continue, and in 2010 the opportunity to send reports directly to the tax office returned.  However, everything turned out according to the unofficial way of carrying out unpopular reforms: tighten the screws, then loosen a little, making everyone think that everything is not so bad.  Simultaneously with the return of direct reporting, so-called accredited key certification centers (ADSC) were introduced.  These commercial structures began to play the role of coordinators of issued and revoked keys / certificates of electronic digital signature (EDS), which is superimposed on sent to the tax reports.  By a strange coincidence, the tax accreditation itself did not pass, and therefore could no longer issue its own free keys.  Entrepreneurs again faced the fact that you have to pay for convenience.  This concludes with a brief excursion into the past, and modern history begins. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/17/ce/17ceeae91c21a28061fb4eb5207e55e2.gif"><br><br>  The modern electronic reporting market is <a href="http://www.sta.gov.ua/control/uk/publish/article%3Fart_id%3D115103%26cat_id%3D115063">divided between ADSSC</a> , each of which promotes its own software for signing and sending documents to the tax and pension fund.  The most popular of them - USC dumping prices on the keys, forcing to use BestZvit - a paid program of its friendly company of the same name.  The rest sell keys are more expensive, but they apply free software to send reports to government agencies.  The range of this software catches on gloom even knowledgeable accountants in melancholy.  Any entrepreneur who has tried to submit reports electronically will confirm all of the shortcomings listed below (the rest can be seen by scrolling through <a href="http://www.bestzvit.com.ua/img/instr.doc">these instructions</a> ): <br><ul><li>  the need to use different programs for generating and sending reports; </li><li>  the need to wade through the monstrous interface; </li><li>  the need for constant software updates to maintain it in accordance with current legislation; </li><li>  Finally, the need to use software in general. </li></ul>  In addition, all existing software is written exclusively under Windows with all the ensuing limitations. <br><br><h1>  Main part </h1><br>  Taxer is determined to make online reporting easy, fast and easy.  Unfortunately, it will not be possible to get rid of the procedure for obtaining EDS keys in accordance with current legislation.  However, all preparatory actions in the form of a visit to a representative of the ADC and tax representative should not take more than a couple of hours and are needed only once. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/a9/4a/a94a6841cd55c31d6933adbf9a4e705b.jpg" align="left">  Our plan: <br><ol><li>  Dial bold beta testers who either already have the keys or are ready to receive them in the near future; </li><li>  To give these users the opportunity to create, sign and send the next quarterly report using our service in the first days of submission (July 1st); </li><li>  Get reviews; </li><li>  From July 3rd to 5th, open a service for everyone; </li><li>  ... </li><li>  Continue Implement Basic Functions From the Togo list at the beginning. </li></ol>  Thus, after a very fast and, we hope, effective testing stage, the first SaaS solution for convenient online reporting will finally appear in Ukrnet. <br><br>  Of course, all our first brave users will not be forgotten, but, on the contrary, will be fully gifted in the future.  We are waiting for all Ukrainian entrepreneurs on <a href="http://taxer.com.ua/volunteer">this special page</a> . <br><br>  As a postscript, we promise to describe the technical side of signing / encrypting / sending reports in the next article. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120708/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120708/</a></p>
