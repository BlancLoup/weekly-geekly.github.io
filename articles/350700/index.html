      We are getting closer to the fourth industrial revolution - an era when new material development, breakthroughs in the field of genetic engineering and digital transformation are increasingly blurring the lines between the physical, biological and digital worlds. <br><br>  When dying off of various industries, people who do not have the skills required to change their jobs are at great risk.  And most importantly, women, judging by the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/press/2016/01/women-in-the-firing-line-of-fourth-industrial-revolution/">study of the</a> World Economic Forum, this problem affects much more.  The thing is that the fair sex is much less than men, in the most promising sectors of the next five years: science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cb/du/3e/cbdu3eubvo0nq4bjct_bxtqfcku.jpeg"><br><br>  According to the <a href="https://blog.linkedin.com/2017/january/20/linkedin-data-reveals-the-most-promising-jobs-of-2017">list of the</a> most promising jobs in 2017, published by LinkedIn, the top 20 professions require STEM industry skills.  And despite the general expansion of human capabilities, there is a permanent gender gap in the world.  According to <a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/priority-areas/gender-and-science/">UNESCO</a> estimates, only 3 out of 10 researchers in the field of science, technology and innovation are women, and according to <a href="https://careers.linkedin.com/diversity-and-inclusion">LinkedIn</a> , women only occupy 2 out of 10 technical jobs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jq/62/lk/jq62lkq-kwlij6im4grbwvrt0lg.jpeg"><br><br>  What can deter girls from appearing in a field that offers skills and knowledge in these industries?  Here are four common misconceptions: <br><br><h4>  Myth number 1: STEM-education has weight only when reaching the highest levels </h4><br>  In fact, STEM is an interdisciplinary approach to teaching students in four special disciplines.  Instead of teaching them individual topics, <a href="http://www.livescience.com/43296-what-is-stem-education.html">STEM combines directions into a single learning model</a> based on real-life situations. <br><br>  STEM is increasingly seen as a set of fundamental skills for study and work, because it opens the doors for young women to higher educational institutions and for good jobs.  Learning STEM disciplines can pave the way for a wide <a href="https://www.ice.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Document/2016/stem-list.pdf">range of areas</a> , including computer science, artificial intelligence (AI), solar technology and robotics technology.  At a more fundamental level, STEM subjects provide critical thinking skills and an integrated approach to solving problems that will be needed in all workplaces of the future. <br><br><h4>  Myth # 2: STEM skills are only useful for STEM work. </h4><br>  In a technology-driven world, the vast majority of jobs require STEM skills in one form or another.  Companies and organizations are improving their business model.  Part of this improvement is to attract talented employees - men and women with skills such as mental alertness that will help the business succeed. <br><br>  Girls who choose a career in STEM, developed critical thinking skills will help to adapt to the economy of the future. <br><br><h4>  Myth number 3: STEM-industries are boring and not related to creativity. </h4><br>  In a <a href="http://newsroom.mastercard.com/asia-pacific/press-releases/parents-are-crucial-influencers-for-girls-pursuing-stem-careers/">survey of Mastercard</a> , which participants were about 1,500 girls from the countries of the Asia-Pacific region aged 12 to 19, 84% indicated that they would like to have creative work, but only 43% called the STEM industry creative. <br><br>  In fact, creativity is an integral part of a successful career in STEM.  <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/stories/people/dona-sarkar.html">Dona Sarkar</a> is a great example.  She is the newly appointed leader of the <a href="https://insider.windows.com/">Windows Insider</a> program, Microsoft's global program, in which millions of users are participating.  They give feedback on earlier versions of Windows.  Dona has come a long way, starting from the position of Software Engineer in the Windows Team more than ten years ago. <br><br>  For her, creating solutions that improve people's lives plays a central role in her work.  She believes that operating systems provide the means to create anything.  She is also the one who worked on the Microsoft HoloLens team, as well as the first stand-alone holographic computer. <br><br>  In addition, she is the author of four books, a blogger and a fashion designer.  Regardless of whether it kodit or draws, creativity is an integral part of everything that it does. <br><br><h4>  Myth # 4: Men are more likely to succeed in STEM areas than women <br></h4><br>  Unfortunately, gender stereotypes exist and take root even in the modern world.  But, having access to technology and education, girls may not agree with this. <br><br>  For nearly 200 years, <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/apac/2016/03/08/10-women-behind-key-technology-breakthroughs">these 10 inspiring women</a> , including Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper, have changed the world in which we live.  They created innovative technologies, without which many of us do not represent today's life, proving that women can achieve great success in the STEM industries. <br><br>  There is no better time than International Women's Day to talk about the incredible girls who have affected the whole world.  We hope to inspire women to courage and creativity, which will go beyond the usual framework and create something more. <br><br><h2>  Well, two inspiring videos at the end! </h2><br><h4>  Great inventions </h4><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y8DBwchocvs&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjK3_K86LVuFMsEuPlFqK1_Q8rQ-g"></iframe><br><br><h4>  Motivation to act </h4><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/y5soEtBwH0Y&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhipr63CV3p_PL-6zUS-G-nc2wqnw"></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/350700/">https://habr.com/ru/post/350700/</a></p>
