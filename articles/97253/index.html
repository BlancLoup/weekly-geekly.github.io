I received them all the time, even the refusal of advertising did not affect their appearance in my phone.  Then there was a quiz, then some other newsletters, but they didn‚Äôt get to me, because after a persistent request, the operator turned off advertising (many advertising mailings are for some reason called informational messages, I‚Äôm angry with this verbal balancing act. Call things your own names. Beeline is no exception, all companies do the same thing, talking about the big three). <br><br>  And then something unusual happened, Beeline decided to pay subscribers for advertising messages.  Not God knows how much, 20 kopecks for one message.  To poverty.  Otherwise, do not say.  In Russia, there have already been attempts to introduce pay-per-view advertising, in particular, the acclaimed SuperFon offered such a service.  They paid not as an example more generously than Beeline offers today.  20 kopecks is not too much, it is practically nothing.  On average, a subscriber will be able to receive about 5 messages of advertising content per month.  <b>Total earn one ruble per month</b> . <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Austrian company Out There Media is a platform provider and counterpart to Beeline in this project.  The project is pilot and will be carried out until January 2011.  The operator will try it on the teeth.  But they want to earn.  Over a thousand contacts from the advertiser will take 400 rubles.

      I remember the bending Beeline WiFi in Moscow, which was not needed by anyone.  But as soon as it was made free, and the user only needed to watch a commercial before the beginning of the session, this project rushed to heaven.  Understandable service, clear exchange.  In the 20 kopecks case there is no payment and no service.  This is a divorce and deception.  For my taste. <br><br>  Offer the exchange operator, one advertising message in exchange for a free SMS, and the questions would disappear.  It is fair and beneficial to all parties.  But earning a ruble a month is a bit excessive.  How much is there an SMS on the Beeline network for the user?  Probably thirty five kopecks.  Not so little in comparison with the proposed compensation for advertising. <br><br>  It is significant how many people do not want to receive advertising.  Of the 50 million subscribers for advertising agreed about 200 thousand.  The numbers speak for themselves.  People need a clear offer, and not just another marketing divorce in the style, I'll give you a pretty penny, and on you will build your business.  They don‚Äôt want people to build a business and get rich.  People are willing to participate in understandable services that benefit all parties.  Is it really such a difficult experience to understand? <br><br>  You would have watched an advertisement in an SMS, if its quantity did not exceed a certain number of messages, the advertisement was targeted for you, and the payment was free SMS, but yours.  Out of curiosity, I would even sign up for such a service.  And you? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97253/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97253/</a></p>
