      The main program and the heart of our conference are technical reports.  This year we will have 21 reports from the best specialists in their field from all over the world: the USA, Canada, England, Germany, France, Finland, Spain, Israel, Taiwan, Romania, Moldova and, of course, Russia. <br><br>  The conference program is scheduled many interesting events: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ 3 key reports <br>  ‚Ä¢ 21 technical reports in 4 sections: <br><br><ul><li>  That's really scary </li><li>  Technical hardcore </li><li>  The future of web </li><li>  Mobile internals </li></ul><br>  ‚Ä¢ 7 workshops from 2 to 5 hours long <br>  ‚Ä¢ More than 7 reports on the fast track (the exact number will be known at the conference) <br>  ‚Ä¢ 2 competence centers with demonstrations of attacks on SAP and mobile applications <br>  ‚Ä¢ Round table <br>  ‚Ä¢ 0-day show <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h5>  Key reports </h5><br><h6>  Keynote to the main program of the first day </h6><br>  <a href="http://2012.zeronights.ru/speakers">The Grugq</a> will tell you where the attackers and hacktivists are punctured and how they can be calculated.  Grugq is an eminent IS researcher with over 10 years of professional experience.  He worked extensively with forensic analysis, binary reverse engineering, rootkits, VoIP, telecommunications and financial security.  Also known as reseller exploits. <br><br><h6>  Keynote to the main program of the second day </h6><br>  <a href="http://2012.zeronights.ru/speakers">Felix 'FX' Lindner</a> is a cult figure in the world of information security, the leader of Phenoelit.  He has performed at Black Hat, CanSecWest, PacSec, DEFCON, Chaos Communication Congress, MEITSEC and many other events.  His research topics are related to Cisco IOS, HP, SAP and RIM BlackBerry printers.  The topic of the report is still kept secret. <br><br><h6>  Keynote to mobile security section </h6><br>  Alexander Polyakov and Dmitry Evdokimov from Digital Security will deliver introductory words on the security of mobile applications, thus opening the mobile security section.  You will learn the latest trends in this area and some history, and also hear more about the reports that will be presented at the section.  But do not rush to think that it will be a boring keynote.  As part of the welcome speech will be presented the results of a new project dedicated to the security of mobile applications. <br><br>  Reports are divided into 4 categories, which cover the most interesting areas of security: <br><br><h5>  That's really scary </h5><br>  In this category, collected reports that show you the real threats that can be implemented in the presence of various vulnerabilities in various systems and technologies.  This is the security of everything that is closely connected with our life and goes beyond the framework of computer systems or relates to systems that are critical for business: the security of aircraft, transportation systems, cars, payment applications, bank cards, EMV, NFC, security systems and critical corporate applications transmitting financial information. <br><br><ul><li>  Alberto Garcia Illera will tell about <a href="http://2012.zeronights.ru/program">hacking the transport system of the</a> whole city. </li><li>  Andrei Costin, ‚Äú <a href="http://2012.zeronights.ru/program">On the security aspects of ADS-B and other‚Äú flying ‚Äùtechnology</a> ‚Äù: Andrey will tell you about the safety of flight control systems.  After this report, you will think about the next time you take a plane ticket :) </li><li>  Nikita Abdullin ‚Äú <a href="http://2012.zeronights.ru/program">Security of modern payment technologies: EMV, NFC, etc.?</a>  ‚Äù: Nikita will tell you all the subtleties of banking systems, having a unique experience in their development and maintenance. </li><li>  Alexander Polyakov will tell about interesting attacks on corporate systems. </li><li>  Babak Javadi, ‚Äú <a href="http://2012.zeronights.ru/program">Armed Failure - Hacking Wireless Alarm Systems</a> ‚Äù: The guru of lockpointing and physical security, one of the founders of TOOL, will tell you about hacking wireless security systems. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Technical hardcore </h5><br>  This category is a paradise for reversers and those who love something harder.  We have prepared for you an excellent portion of reverse from those who know a lot about it. <br><br><ul><li>  Dmytro Oleksiuk, ‚Äú <a href="http://2012.zeronights.ru/program">Applied anti-forensics: rootkits, kernel vulnerabilities and then some</a> ‚Äù: Cr4sh will tell you how to reinstall a rootkit that you cannot detect using familiar methods.  Believe me, this man knows what he is talking about!  This is not another bla-bla about interception functions. </li><li>  Mateusz 'j00ru' Jurczyk, ‚Äú <a href="http://2012.zeronights.ru/program">Windows Kernel Reference Count Vulnerabilities - Case Study</a> ‚Äù: who does not know who J00ru is, are simply obliged to re-read his last draft.

On the report of Ivan from Dr.  Web you can learn more about this. </li><li>  Nikita Tarakanov with the yet secret title of the report will tell us about his last 0 deyah, and be sure it will be cool!  The author promised live demonstrations. </li><li>  Atte Kettunen, Miaubiz, ‚Äú <a href="http://2012.zeronights.ru/program">Fuzzing at scale and in style</a> ‚Äù: the researchers will tell you how and what to do with browser fuzzing.

We even specifically invited a researcher from France. <br><br><ul><li>  Shay Chen, ‚Äú <a href="http://2012.zeronights.ru/program">The Diviner</a> ‚Äù: it is now possible to get the source code of a web application when scanning with a black box.  Of course, not all and not always, but the tool that will be presented copes with it more than adequately, and this technology can make a breakthrough in the field of BlackBox, although it has several disadvantages.  We advise you to pay attention to this report.  Shay is the technical director of a startup Hacktics, which was recently purchased by Ernst and Young. </li><li>  Michail Fyrstov, ‚Äú <a href="http://2012.zeronights.ru/program">Impact on mongoDB</a> ‚Äù: the popularity of NoSQL databases and, as a result, attacks against them are gaining momentum.
