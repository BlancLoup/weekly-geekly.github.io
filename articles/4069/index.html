  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Print ads disappointed Google for now.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Even <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> has errors and miscalculations.  The main thing - do not be shy to recognize them.  Representatives of the company recently quite frankly admitted that attempts to expand the Google advertising network to print media were not as successful as expected. <br><br>  At a meeting with investors, Jonathan Rosenberg (Jonathan Rosenberg), senior vice president of product management, admitted that <a href="https://adwords.google.com/publicationads">Google Publication Ads</a> program did not meet expectations.  ‚ÄúOff-line print ads did not start as fast as we would like,‚Äù <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/investor/content/jun2006/pi20060601_474265.htm">said</a> Rosenberg.  He said that he would have to work a lot with the publishers of magazines in order to work out a suitable advertising format. <br><br>  Indeed, it is not easy to choose a suitable format, since the system is quite extraordinary.  Initially it was supposed that it would work like this.  Each member of the Google Publication Ads program can choose a newspaper or magazine where he wants to place an advertisement, taking into account the demographics of the target audience, circulation of the publication or by keywords.  Then, using the online interface, you can determine the appearance of the banner: insert a logo, ad text and - most importantly - a tracked URL, the referrals to which will be counted, as well as a special phone number, the number of calls to which will also be counted.  In fact, it turns out an offline analogue of interactive online advertising.  More precisely, the expansion of AdSense to offline media.  As with the AdSense system, even the smallest advertisers, who have never before advertised in newspapers and magazines, can participate here.

      Preliminary testing of the program took place in September-October 2005 in PC Magazine and Maximum PC magazines and was considered successful.  After that, Google expanded the program to include newspapers, but the results of the experiment were very controversial. <br><br>  This is not the first attempt by Google to expand its "advertising empire" beyond the limits of online.  The company is also looking for ways to enter the radio advertising market - in January, dMarc Broadcasting, which specializes in radio advertising management, was acquired for this purpose.  Well, and television itself should come to the Internet, since recently Google has supported video ads on its Google AdSense network. <br><br>  However, so far Google has failed to establish itself in the traditional advertising market.  Experts attribute this to the fact that the Google brand is something that is associated with the Internet.  Therefore, advertisers are not yet inclined to trust the company's offline experiments, although they are very curious. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4069/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4069/</a></p>
