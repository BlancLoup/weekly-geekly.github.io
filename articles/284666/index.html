    <h4>  Original case </h4><br>  An agreement has been reached on receiving investments in the amount of X USD. <br><br>  A company is created in which the founders are the project team and the investor (who invests the sum of X and receives a share of Y). <br>  <b>UPD.</b>  It was decided that the project will not be incorporated in Ukraine.  (to whom the other is relevant - the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/my_business/136099/">situation with incorporation in Ukraine is considered in the comments</a> ). <br><br>  In other words, the team (residents of Ukraine) does not invest real money in the company (this is important ... the reasons are lower). <br><br>  During the negotiations (at their different stages), the opinion is voiced that in order to create a company abroad, the team needs to obtain individual licenses from the NBU (National Bank of Ukraine), otherwise you may get into trouble with certain penalties. <br><br>  Without any ulterior motive, the team accepts this as an axiom ... but later decides, nevertheless, to stop being <a href="http://monkey-habits.com/book.php">‚Äúblack monkeys‚Äù</a> and dig deeper. <br><br><h4>  In fact </h4><br>  A detailed study of the issue showed that in the framework of the original case without licensing, nothing fatal will occur, in general, will not. <br><br>  <i>Primary sources say:</i> <br><br>  Obtaining individual licenses of the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) is necessary for Ukrainian legal entities and individuals for: <br><br><ul><li>  Opening and using an account in a foreign bank (outside Ukraine).  The procedure for obtaining licenses is established by Decree No. 485 of the Board of the National Bank of Ukraine of October 14, 2004 ‚ÄúOn Approval of the Regulations on the Procedure for Issuing the National Bank of Ukraine for Placement of Currency Values ‚Äã‚Äãon Accounts Outside of Ukraine by Residents (Legal and Individuals)‚Äù registered with the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine 5 November 2004, No. 1413/10012 </li><li>  Transfer of foreign currency outside Ukraine with the purpose of making investments abroad.  The instruction on the procedure for issuing such licenses was approved by the Resolution of the Board of the National Bank of Ukraine on March 16, 1999 N 122, registered with the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine on April 26, 1999, N 259/3552. </li><li>  The transfer of foreign currency outside Ukraine for payment by individuals - residents of services under contracts (insurance policies, certificates, certificates) of life insurance concluded with non-residents, and the conduct of individual foreign exchange transactions by Ukrainian residents.  The regulation on the procedure for issuing individual such licenses was approved by the Resolution of the Board of the National Bank of Ukraine of June 17, 2004 N 266, registered with the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine on July 16, 2004 for N 897/9496. </li></ul><br><br>  It turns out that a startup team that has received an investment and is incorporating in the West may not worry about this topic (even if the investor is domestic; it is licensed, in fact, the withdrawal of foreign currency). <br><br><h4>  Now about taxes </h4><br>  A separate topic is the taxation of the startup team, as residents of Ukraine. <br><br>  It is important to remember the difference between the taxation of incomes of individuals (salaries, for example) and the taxation of profits of a company established by a person (in practice, many people confuse these things ... their own pocket, practically). <br><br>  The general principle of paying taxes is that if you pay somewhere once, you don‚Äôt need to pay another time. <br>  But here you need to be careful. <br>  The ‚Äúhome‚Äù country must uphold these international legal norms. <br>  Ukraine supports.  This makes me happy. <br><br> <code> ()     ‚Äì      ,     ,             .  . 19   ¬´  ¬ª           .            ,          . <br> <br>          .            ?          .    ,       /       . ,     ,    ‚Äî  ( ).
