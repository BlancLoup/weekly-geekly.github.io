  <section class="page js-page"><h1>7 reasons to read a report at the conference</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://blogs.byte-force.com/xor/images/add-logo.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In September, the city of Yaroslavl will host a conference of professional developers <a href="http://it-conf.ru/ru/content/267.htm%3Futm_source%3Dhabrhabr%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Demail1%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Dadd" rel="nofollow">Application Developer Days</a> .  The announcement of the event from the organizers was already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/conf/95290/" rel="nofollow">on Habr√©</a> , I recommend to get acquainted with it in more detail.  Immediately, I wanted to try to explain to readers why conferences are needed at all, why attend them, travel or fly over 1000 kilometers, waste time, and even more so prepare reports. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Reason 1, knowledge </h3><br>  No matter how trite it sounds, but at conferences there is a large flow of information.  If you are a professional, and even more so a professional developer, then you must be interested in new movements in the development environment.  Since the movements there are stormy, the best opportunity may be a bunch of developers like you who will share their knowledge and experience with you.  ADD 2010 is unique in that it does not close on one topic, platform, or development tool.  On ADD, you can learn first-hand about something new for yourself, about the parallel worlds of the development world, about other technologies, ways to solve problems. <br><br><h3>  Reason 2, advertising </h3><br>  As a representative of your company, you can use the conference as an opportunity to inform the world about your products, interesting solutions.  Since conferences bring together diverse people, which are geographically very different from each other, your report becomes a good way to trumpet yourself to the whole country.  A technical demonstration for a group of developers may work better than any advertising to which these developers may be indifferent.

    <h3>  Reason 3, freebie. </h3><br>  The speaker attends the conference for free.  This can be a significant argument, especially if you get to the event from a distance.  In general, conferences are not organized because of the desire to cash in, but simply because such an organization costs money.  You, as a speaker, are yourself part of the organization and do not pay for its visit. <br><br><h3>  Reason 4, experience </h3><br>  Preparing and reading a report is an extremely interesting life experience.  You not only develop communication skills, but also get new skills: a speaker, an interesting speaker.  This can be important for you if in your work with professional growth you have to spend more and more time discussing projects, presentations and other reports.  Speaking from time to time at conferences, you gain experience that will definitely come in handy in your life and work. <br><br><h3>  Reason 5, dating </h3><br>  The conference is a big gathering of people who somehow communicate throughout the duration of the event.  Usually, at conferences there are people who are difficult to meet elsewhere - well-known developers, company representatives, executives.  We can assume that the party at conferences is a great way to make friends, both pleasant and useful.  Being a conference speaker, there are a lot more opportunities for making acquaintances: communication with the organizing committee, with other speakers, my own mini party - all this contributes to this. <br><br><h3>  Reason 6, fame </h3><br>  At the last ReMIX conference from the speaker of a working HR, it was thought that developers are hard to find.  It is not clear where they live.  Therefore, it is proposed that HR and developers meet at conferences and find each other.  The best way to express yourself, of course, will be a report.  Good stuff, interesting topic, successful report - and we can say that your fame has risen a little bit higher, someone noticed you, and another line appeared in your resume.  Maybe not the most important, but who knows, the fifth reason may contribute to getting a good job. <br><br><h3>  Reason 7, just for fun </h3><br>  Trips to events usually give a huge charge of positive energy.  Charge the brains, give new ideas, aspirations.  Inspired by new thoughts.  Charging in this way a couple of times a year, you can work to the maximum power, constantly generating ideas.  Speakers from conferences get more emotion, from being a speaker is even more interesting. <br><br><h3>  Total </h3><br>  I hope that you are a little interested.  If you have not been to developer conferences, then September and <a href="http://it-conf.ru/ru/content/267.htm%3Futm_source%3Dhabrhabr%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Demail1%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Dadd" rel="nofollow">Application Developer Days</a> in Yaroslavl is an excellent opportunity to get acquainted with them.  And to become a speaker at ADD is the easiest way to get there.  See you in Yaroslavl!  :-) <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95472/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95472/</a></p>
