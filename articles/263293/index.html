    <h4>  DarkMarket </h4><br>  The guy is sitting on a hard polished wooden chair and angrily looking at the camera.  Against the background of a shabby plaster wall, he is in his shorts and holds a sign in his hands.  It is written in large letters: <br><br>  ‚ÄúMY PRESENT NAME IS MERT ORTACH. <br>  I AM A RAT, PIG, I AM A REPORTER (STUKACH) <br>  I HAVE CHO0 MISSED. ‚Äù <br><br>  The appearance of this photo on the DarkMarket forum in May of 2008 forced Mularsky to hastily return to the NCFTA communications room.  The command center would be helpful to know that one of the admins of Master Splintr kidnapped and tortured an informant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f08/ee5/73a/f08ee573a3d44214abdefeaebe5c64ba.jpg"><br><br>  <i>If anyone has recommendations on how to translate something better, the original chapter is given at the end of the post.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd5/e0a/8c1/cd5e0a8c1cba4529955d56aee17ab0eb.jpg"><br><br>  <b>NCFTA</b> is a non-profit organization sponsored by a number of firms, Internet companies and the US federal government, whose goal is to collect information on crimes in the economic sphere and in high technology. <br><br>  Also in the building of this agency is the headquarters of a special unit of the FBI, which is called the Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãInitiative and Resource Fusion Unit, whose staff and carried out the operation with DarkMarket. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a44/2c5/136/a442c51364011f606892814fd89dddd6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Mularsky, he's the master Splintr, an FBI undercover agent.</i> <br><br>  <b>Chapter Continuation</b> <br><br>  Cha0 was an engineer in Istanbul, he sold high-quality skimmers and PIN keyboards for ATMs to scammers around the world.  A reader installed in an ATM recorded information from a magnetic tape from all credit cards, and a fake keyboard wrote down a secret PIN-code. <br><br>  His flash ad on DarkMarket was a classic - it started with a cartoon man who sneaks in through a house full of money.  <i>"Is that you"?</i>  <i>- written below - "Yes, if you bought the reader and PIN-keyboard from Cha0."</i> <br><br>  Instructions for new buyers were accompanied by a smiling caricature and Cha0 itself. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúHi, my name is Cha0.</i>  <i>I am a developer of skimmers and PIN keyboards.</i>  <i>I work 24 hours a day and produce the best skimming devices.</i>  <i>You can make huge money in this business with me and my group.</i>  <i>We make devices for beginners.</i>  <i>It's very simple! ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Animated ha0 then offers a couple of useful tips: <br><ul><li>  Do not install the equipment in the morning, as passersby at this time are more alert; </li><li>  Do not choose a place through which more than 250 people pass per day; </li><li>  Be wary of cities with a population of less than 15,000 - people know too well what ATMs look like and can notice equipment. </li></ul><br>  Master Splintr knew that ha0 was a burnt felon and could use force to protect his multimillion-dollar business, despite the cartoon-like approach to marketing.  And it turned out to be true. <br><br>  Mert "Kier" Ortac was part of the ha0 gang called Crime Enforcers, until he ran to the Turkish TV station to tap on Cha0.  After a number of interviews, he disappeared.  When he appeared, some time later, he told about his abduction and beating of Cha0 and his assistants. <br><br>  Now Cha0 confirmed this story by posting a photo on DarkMarket as a warning to the others.  The photo justified the FBI‚Äôs long-standing suspicions about the rising level of violence in the computer underground.  With the amount of money invested in the underground, it became clear that carders would resort to violence in order to protect or increase their source of income. <br><br>  Max was imprisoned in Ohio, and DarkMarket was growing up unhindered.  Mularski focused on the most influential people and Cha0 was among them.  The Turkish Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãInvestigator spent three months with Mularski side by side at the NCFTA to figure out the manufacturer of the skimmers. <br><br>  Mularsky presented two computers to Cha0, thus making the first step in the investigation.  Cha0 redirected the package to his lackeys, who were supervised by the Turkish National Police.  This led to Katagay Evyapan (Cagatay Evyapan), an electronic engineer with a lot of criminal experience, whose biography coincided with the biography of Cha0, which he secretly shared with Mularski. <br><br>  The police visited several International Shipping Companies and interrogated them about Cha0 orders.  One of them recognized the delivery of equipment from Istanbul to Europe, and one of the participants of the organization as the sender.  This gave all the evidence the police needed. <br><br>  On September 5, five police officers in bullet-proof vests broke into the house of Cha0 on the outskirts of Istanbul. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/984YFdqhoKo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjSTOd6Nm2SEEH9Gh7FhI65wXXekg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Bursting into the house, they laid Cha0 and his minion on the ground threatening with a weapon. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6db/e2b/e04/6dbe2be045054f19ac88f2560b6d82dc.jpg"><br><br>  Inside the house, they found a full-fledged electrical laboratory and production line with all the components neatly laid out in buckets and boxes.  About a dozen computers worked on the tables.  Cha0 had almost the same card-breaking equipment, like the Chris Aragon factory.  The same huge boxes, in which lay thousands of readers and PIN-keyboards, waiting to be sent.  Cha0 entries indicated that four of them had already reached the United States. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c03/a92/2c1/c03a922c1bd14ab5a4fb7d622634ee53.jpg"><br><br>  The cops brought <b>Evyapana</b> in handcuffs - a tall, muscular man with short cropped hair and a black T-shirt depicting death with a scythe.  The face of organized crime on the Internet. <br><br>  In Turkey, six members of the Cha0 gang were arrested along with him. <br><br>  Cha0 was the last on the list of Mularski.  Another trump card was taken from DarkMarket.  <b>Markus Kellerer - Matrix001</b> , was arrested in Germany in May 2007, and he spent 4 months in a high-security prison. <br><br>  <b>Reniqant "JiLsi" Sabramaniam</b> - a resident of England born in Sri Lanka, was arrested in July 2007 after the detectives, together with the anti-organized crime agency, sat in an Internet cafe, which he used as an office, and compared his appearances in cafe with his posts on DarkMarket and chat rooms with master splintrom. <br><br>  <b>John "devilman" McHugh</b> , was arrested at the same time;  the police found a credit card counterfeiting factory in his house. <br><br>  With the help of Mularski, the police also arrested <b>Yerkan "Seagate" Findikoglu</b> , a black market participant who organized a massive money- <b>making</b> operation in the "King Arthur" style, responsible for $ 2 million stolen from banks.  They managed to return one million after his arrest.  Twenty-seven members of the Seagate organization were also arrested in Turkey, and the FBI arrested six of its distributors in the United States. <br><br>  Now that Cha0 and Seagate were behind bars, Mularski‚Äôs work was completed.  DarkMarket for two years "brought" Mularsk 56 arrests in 4 countries.  On Tuesday, September 16, 2008, he published a post announcing the closure of DarkMarket.  As a tribute to the history and culture of carding, the FBI agent borrowed the legendary message of King Arthur about closing the Planet of Carding several years ago: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúGood afternoon, dear and dear forum participants,‚Äù he began, ‚Äúit‚Äôs time to let you know the bad news ‚Äî the forum will be closed.</i>  <i>Yes, really closed.</i>  <i>Over the past year we have lost a huge number of admins on the forums: Aisman in the carders market, JiLsi and Matrix001 have disappeared, and now Cha0 on the DM.</i>  <i>It becomes clear that this forum, which has lived for almost 3 years, has begun to attract too much attention from the world intelligence services.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I prefer to leave as King Arthur, and not as Eisman.</i>  <i>Isman decided to simply change his nickname to Apex, and continued to manage CM.</i>  <i>King Arthur just closed the Carder Planet and disappeared into the night.</i>  <i>History has shown that Asman made a huge mistake.</i>  <i>I will not repeat it. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Full post in English</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Good day, respected and dear forum members. <br><br>  The forum should be closed.  Yes, I really mean close ... ... <br><br>  First of all, it‚Äôs obvious that you‚Äôre not happy.  Over the past year:  JiLsi and Matrix001 disappeared, ChaO on DM.  It is apparent that this is a forum for people who want to travel.  It‚Äôs a very unfortunate situation, because we‚Äôve established it.  Such is life ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ when you are on top‚Ä¶ people try to bring you down. <br><br>  Although we‚Äôre eliminated from the rippers, we‚Äôre still eliminated.  They continue to gather evidence on us.  They read our posts.  There are no special requests.  It would be a lot of fun, not to mention a fruitless purity.  For we have been attempting this for the last year.  Obviously, the effort is futile.  It is time to start fresh. <br><br>  To quote and paraphrase King Arthur of Carder Planet;  How clever can we be?  But you can find our VPN even though the most darkest corners of the world.  All of us can make mistakes.  Iceman, ChaO and Maksik are prime examples.  We can forget to switch on the VPN, get frustrated with inconsistent proxies, or accidentally give out Identifying informaiton.  It is not a secret that FBI employees go to the ISPs and get logs and history logs.  It is just the matter of time and will.  Hey, I‚Äôm not sure where to go.  There can be no sub-nets of the C class. <br><br>  I like it Arthur than Iceman.  Whereas the Iceman has been, and continues to run. CM Carol Planet and faded into the night.  History has been shown that I will not make the same. <br><br>  Because of this, I've discussed the situation with the Admins.  Should we keep it close longer?  It has not been an easy decision for me, because I have spent it a lot.  I've thought about selling the forum.  However DM has been my soul.  How do you sell your soul?  I have it.  It is what it is.  All good things come to an end. <br><br>  It will close. <br><br>  I send out my regards all members <br><br>  Fucktards ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ fuck you all ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ <br><br>  MS. <br></div></div><br>  Mularsky planned to support the legend of the Master Splintra.  It was a great legend that could be useful for future investigations.  But it didn't happen.  A week after the closure of DarkMarket, a reporter for the Sudwestrundfunk, a south-west German public radio, received court documents on the Matrix001 case, which buried the legend of Mularski.  The American press very quickly picked up the story.  Now 2,500 DarkMarket members knew that they were doing business on a dummy site and that Aisman was right all that time. <br><br>  Three days after the failure of the legend, Mularsky found an ICQ message addressed to Master Splintru.  It was from TheUnknown, one of the suspects, who managed to escape from the police. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúYou're *** a piece of ***.</i>  <i>***.</i>  <i>Thought you would catch me?</i>  <i>Haha</i>  <i>Fucking newbie.</i>  <i>You didn't even come close to me. ‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  <i>(‚ÄúU fucking piece of shit. Motherfucker. Thought you can catch me. Hahaha. Fucking newb. U are nowhere near me.‚Äù)</i> <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúIf you want to surrender, let me know.‚Äù</i> Mularski replied.  - <i>‚ÄúIt will be easier than looking around all my life.‚Äù</i> <br><br>  TheUnknown gave up a week later. <br><br>  Mularski sighed with relief as he learned that he had been uncovered.  Two years in a row, the laptop was his constant companion - even on vacation he was online, talking to scammers.  Sometimes it gave him pleasure to build relationships with suspects, to tease and mock them.  Master Splintr could say such things to criminals that no respected FBI agent could say. <br><br>  Mularski sought to return his usual life back, it took time.  Even a month after closing DarkMarket, he still struggled with anxiety.  Mularski had another goal.  Stop being a master Splintrom. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">original</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  DarkMarket <br>  The man is sitting on a polished wooden chair and staring balefully into the camera. <br>  Paint peels from a cracked plaster wall behind him.  He's been stripped down to his underwear, <br>  holding a handwritten sign over his exposed paunch.  I AM KIER, it reads, in large block <br>  letters.  MY REAL NAME IS MERT ORTAC.‚Ä¶ I AM RAT.  I AM PIG.  I AM FUCKED BY CHA0. <br>  DarkMarket in May 2008 sent Mularski hurrying back into <br>  the NCFTA communications room.  Headquarters would like to know that one of Master <br>  Splyntr's admins had just been kidnapped and tortured an informant. <br>  ATM skimmers and PIN pads to <br>  fraudsters around the world.  Covertly affixed to a cash machine, the skimmer would record the <br>  PIN card overlay stored during magstripe <br>  the user's secret code. <br>  Cha0 cut a jaunty presence in the underground.  His Flash-animated banner ad on <br>  DarkMarket was a classic, opening a cartoon man wading through a house full of cash.  ‚ÄúIs <br>  that you? ‚Äùthe text asks.  ‚ÄúYes.  If you bought a skimmer and PIN pad from Cha0. ‚ÄùA similarly <br>  This is a video tutorial <br>  ‚ÄúHi, my name is Cha0.  I'm a developer of skimming devices.  I work for you twenty-four hours a <br>  day and make the best devices for skimming.  You'll be able to make money in this business. <br>  with me and my group.  We make these devices for newbies ‚Äî it's that easy to use! ‚ÄùThe <br>  animated Cha0 goes on offer offer advice advice: Don't install your skimmer in the morning, <br>  because passersby are more vigilant at that time.  Don't choose a location where 250 people or <br>  more pass a day.  Avoid cities with a population less than 15,000 ‚Äî residents know too well <br>  ATM is a Cha0's product. <br>  Not always accepted his whimsical marketing, Cha0 <br>  Do you want to get a multimillion-dollar case? <br>  business.  Now he'd proven it.  Mert ‚ÄúKier‚Äù Ortac had been part of Cha0's organization, the <br>  Crime Enforcers, <br>  After a couple of interviews, he vanished.  When he resurfaced a short time later, he told a <br>  harrowing story about being abducted and beaten by Cha0 and his henchmen. <br>  The Cha0 has been confirmed by posting the kidnap photo to DarkMarket as a warning <br>  to others. <br>  FBI's long-held suspicions <br>  getting violent.  With millions of dollars, it had <br>  it seemed to be inevitable. <br>  crime to <br>  M ar Dark <br>  and Mularski was the most heaviest hitters ‚Äî Cha0 among them.  A turkish cybercrime <br>  detective had spent three months at the NCFTA and was working with <br>  Mularski to run down the skimmer maker. <br>  Mularski Cha0 had sent two lightweight PCs <br>  door in the investigation.  Cha0 had directed by flunkies in his organization, who <br>  were promptly put under surveillance by the Turkish National Police.  That led to cagatay <br>  Evyapan, an electrical record with a prior criminal record ‚Äî details that jibed with the <br>  biography Cha0 had shared privately with Mularski. <br>  The police approached them about <br>  Cha0's operations.  One of them shipments from Istanbul to <br>  Europe, as the shipper. <br>  What they needed.  On September 5, five police in bulletproof <br>  vests raided Cha0's apartment on the outskirts of Istanbul.  They rushed into his house and <br>  pushed Cha0 and an associate to the ground at gunpoint. <br>  Inside his apartment <br>  neatly organized in trays and bins.  Nearly a dozen computers were running on the desks.  Cha0 <br>  Chris Aragon's factory, as well <br>  as one of the giant pink boxes and two thousand PIN pads, <br>  all awaiting international shipment.  Cha0's records showed that you had already <br>  gotten into the United States. <br>  Evyapan out in handcuffs, a tall, beefy man with close-cropped hair and a <br>  black T-shirt emblazoned with the Grim Reaper.  The face of organized crime in the Internet <br>  age. <br>  Cha0 was undercover authorization;  the other key <br>  DarkMarket players had already been taken down.  Markus Kellerer, Matrix001, was arrested in <br>  Germany in May 2007 and spent four months in a high-security prison.  Renukanth ‚ÄúJiLsi‚Äù <br>  Subramaniam, a Sri Lankan ‚Äì born British citizen, was raided in London in June 2007 after <br>  detectives with internet cafe hed <br>  Bean with JiLsi's posts on DarkMarket <br>  and his chats with Master Splyntr.  JiLsi's associate, sixty-seven-year-old John ‚ÄúDevilman‚Äù <br>  McHugh, was picked up at the same time;  found a credit card counterfeiting factory in <br>  the senior citizen's home. <br>  In Turkey, six members of Cha0's organization were charged along with Cha0.  With <br>  Mideski's help, the police also swooped in on Erkan ‚ÄúSeagate‚Äù Findikoglu, a DarkMarket <br>  Arthur ‚Äì style cash out <br>  million dollars in million <br>  cash at his arrest.  Twenty-seven members of Seagate's organization were charged in Turkey, <br>  and the FBI has rounded up six of his cashers in the United States. <br>  With Cha0 and Seagate in Jail <br>  had now resulted in fifty-six arrests in four countries.  On Tuesday, September 16, 2008, he <br>  drafted a post formally announcing the closure of the site.  As an homage to the carding <br>  FBI agent borrowed from King Arthur's legendary message closing <br>  Carder Planet years before.  ‚ÄúGood day, respected and dear forum members,‚Äù he began. <br>  It is a forum should be closed.  Yes, I really mean <br>  closed. <br>  The admins of the forums: Iceman on <br>  Carders Market;  JiLsi and Matrix001 disappeared, and now, Cha0 on DM.  It is apparent <br>  this is a forum that has been attracting too much <br>  attention from a lot of the world services.‚Ä¶ <br>  I like it Arthur than Iceman.  Whereas iceman decided <br>  CM, King <br>  Arthur closed CarderPlanet and faded into the night.  History has shown that Iceman <br>  made a fatal mistake.  I will not make the same. <br>  Mularski planned to keep his master. Splyntr identity dormant but alive: He'd have a wellestablished <br>  he needed it in his pocket <br>  future investigations.  But it was not to be.  About a week after DarkMarket went dark, a <br>  Southwest Germany public radio reporter for Sudwestrundfunk <br>  Mularski's double life.  The US press picked up <br>  the story.  Now 2,500 members of DarkMarket knew they'd been doing business on a sting site <br>  Iceman had right all along. <br>  Three days after the story <br>  Master Splyntr waiting on his computer.  It was from TheUnknown, a UK target who'd gone on <br>  the run after he was raided by the British police.  ‚ÄúU fucking piece of shit.  Motherfucker. <br>  Thought you can catch me.  Hahaha  Fucking newb.  U are nowhere near me. ‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúIf you want to make arrangements, let me know,‚Äù Mularski wrote back.  ‚ÄúIt <br>  will be easier than looking for your life. ‚Äù <br>  TheUnknown turned himself in a week later. <br>  Have his secret identity revealed;  for two years his laptop <br>  had his constant companion ‚Äî even on vacation, he'd been online talking to carders.  He'd <br>  it was a building online friendship <br>  others.  Master Splyntr couldn‚Äôt have any respect to the FBI agent never could. <br>  Eager as Mularski has been his life back, it would take time.  Nearly a month after <br>  He was still fighting a vague restlessness.  Mularski had one more <br>  challenge to master.  He'd have to master Splyntr. <br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/263293/">https://habr.com/ru/post/263293/</a></p>
