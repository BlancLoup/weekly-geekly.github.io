    <h3>  Stands </h3><br>  This year, stands of companies that not only develop information security solutions were presented, but also integrator companies that implement and develop their solutions to provide comprehensive security protection. <br><br>  Note the stands we liked.  Let's start with the company Positive Technologies, which introduced the beta version of the free vulnerability scanner PT BlackBox Scanner, to identify vulnerabilities in web applications. <br><br>  To check your application with a scanner, you will need to confirm your ownership of the site, and the cloud scanner will search for weak points.  It is possible to scan using the agent without confirming the ownership of the site. <br><br>  You can test your web resource on the scanner site - <a href="https://bbs.ptsecurity.com/">bbs.ptsecurity.com</a> . <br><br>  We expect the appearance of QRadar SIEM Community Edition for use in small businesses with EPS restrictions and with the ability to upgrade the number of processed events. <br><br><h3>  Short line </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/eef/9c2/3b1/eef9c23b144b4ae7911880b4cbfd2c65.png"><br>  <i>Microsoft for the booth with Windows and Xbox.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/75a/762/2f2/75a7622f201642d0a40f885106d63ce7.png"><br>  <i>Rostelecom, thanks for the delicious coffee and fresh juice!</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e22/92e/533/e2292e5335e54e5cafa63d765e2a86f6.png"><br>  <i>Infotecs provided an opportunity to take a test and test ViPNet Alcotronic!</i>  <i>/&gt; @ roman_rrrrr</i> <br><br>  Axoft for the ‚Äúhackers in da box‚Äù attraction.  Beyond Security - for the registration form with the input of the name, e-mail and password for a 40 ‚Äù+ touch screen monitor with an on-screen keyboard. <br><br><h3>  Competitive areas </h3><br>  We should also mention contests for forum participants. <br><br>  <b>Big jackpot</b> - ATM and self-service kiosks, these are the objects that are located on the way of our journey to work, study and our friends.  The cassettes, packed with neatly cut paper, are often the victims of both smart and <a href="http://ufa-daily.ru/stories/5368">not very smart</a> crooks.  Visitors can try themselves in the role of a DBO systems researcher and open a bag of gold in the Hardware Village; two self-service kiosks and one ATM are used as test subjects. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/13b/29d/1cf/13b29d1cf60543498127b0dee589ee59.png"><br>  <i <a="" href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/bystroff/" class="user_link">bystroff</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/6c0/aa2/33c/6c0aa233c7d2400e8c745cd30a67c633.png"><br>  <i>Kiosk Remote Service # 1</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/620/a94/fe8/620a94fe80e248998af17798b005e476.png"><br>  <i>Remote Service Kiosk # 2</i> <br><br>  <b>2600</b> - And I twist the steering wheel and press on the gas ... your task is to make a call from a Soviet-style payphone to a specific number and not to spend and return the token. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1ea/d4a/4ee/1ead4a4eedd1489f80e82cd070e11565.png"><br>  <i>@dmitryzakharenko</i> <br><br>  <b>Pouring</b> - the traditional closing of the competition program on PHDays for participants who have reached alcohol maturity.  The selected participants will have to test the strength of a web application under the protection of WAF (Web Application Firewall) and demonstrate the ability to think soberly in any situation. <br><br>  When the ‚Äúprotection system‚Äù is triggered, the participants are invited to drink 50 ml of a strong and very hot drink every 5 minutes, and then, continue the fight until the main game flag is captured.  If the main flag could not be picked up, the winner is determined by the number of flags collected during ‚Äúgame time‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>CAMBreaker</b> - the Internet of things is <b>taking</b> a wide and confident step, and hacking into devices of this class can bring a lot of valuable information to an attacker.  To participate, it is recommended to capture a gentleman's kit, which will help find a web vulnerability or help reverse the firmware. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/683/86f/e77/68386fe77c904361bfc1032de4e6c10f.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f88/01d/dcb/f8801ddcb3ae4477b83eb8226a9dd35d.png"><br>  <i>IoT by Google</i> <br><br>  <b>Automotive Village: CarPWN</b> - forum participants can test the safety of the Tesla Model S vehicle. Finding the right wires and blocks, properly connecting to the vehicle‚Äôs on-board network and conducting a MiTM attack, it‚Äôs all possible to try during two days of the forum with an open stand Tesla! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f57/92f/e31/f5792fe31aa94d50a81e18ab98434ce8.png"><br><br>  <b>WAF bypass</b> is a traditional PHDays contest where you need to bypass the firewall (ITU) from PT Application Firewall (PT AF).  The winner is determined based on the number of points earned, which are awarded for receiving flags.  This year, the direction is taken to crawl a new component of PT AF to protect databases. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/341/357/05d/34135705d37a43deb381dc7016d7f744.png"><br><br>  <b>MITM Mobile</b> - Interception of SMS, telephone conversations and USSD, deployment and work with false base stations - all this can be seen on the stand and try to master the techniques for hacking your own operator.  The GSM standard can be cracked not only by special services with expensive equipment, but also by a technically savvy participant with a $ 25 piece of hardware. <br><br>  <b>HackBattle</b> - solving complex and unexpected tasks in real time on the main stage, where you need to demonstrate the skills and abilities to work in high load mode with a demonstration of speed and ingenuity in solving the provided questions.  To participate in the competition was required to pass the first stage, the qualifying test.
