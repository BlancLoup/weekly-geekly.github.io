  <section class="page js-page"><h1>KTRU (Catalog of goods, works, services) or the death of IT public procurement</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Long ago in the field of public procurement was a big scandal.  The smart chief physicians purchased not just medicines for the active substance and dosage, but medicines from a specific manufacturer, inserting into the technical task for state procurement all sorts of cunning requirements for the medicine. <br><br>  According to the results of the scandal, an analysis was carried out and it was decided that government orders were mired in corruption, expose unreasonable requirements for goods, and even call the requirements themselves on the sly, so that an honest supplier gets more confused.  (For example, the volume of a substance can be called the content of a substance in a package, the mass of a substance at a density, etc.).  And the government decided to issue a resolution 08.02.2017 N 145, which introduced the concept of the <a href="http://zakupki.gov.ru/epz/ktru/quicksearch/search.html">Catalog of goods, works, services (KTRU)</a> in which for each typical purchased item there are requirements for the goods that can be specified in the TOR, and strictly in accordance with the name in the KTRU. <a name="habracut"></a>  And additional requirements can be put forward to the product only with a clear rationale (for <a href="https://solutions.fas.gov.ru/to/magadanskoe-ufas-rossii/04-30-79-2018">example, the FAS decision, according to which the requirements of GOST are recognized as illegal, since there is no such thing in the KTRU and the customer willfully</a> ). <br><br>  And everything would have been nothing, but since September 15 of this year, the KTRU on the servers, system units, laptops, and a lot of everything else IT began to operate. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      And here it turns out that the server has only three characteristics of the object in the KTRU: <br>  "Number of processors", "RAM", "Volume of installed drives".  AND EVERYTHING!  No kernels, no interfaces for you, and even a ‚Äúnumber of drives‚Äù and all sorts of raids are self-willed from the customer and unnecessary requirements.  And so the type of drives, suddenly someone wants the SSD, and generally evil. <br><br>  And here it suddenly turned out that if I brought my TK to the 80th nuclear server to the requirements of the KTRU, then instead of it you can easily put not the newest Iphone and I will have to accept it.  Well, what of it?  The memory of the iphone is sea, the type of memory cannot be rationed.  The processors are in my TZ 4. The cores are not standardized, the type of processors is not standardized.  Well, the iphone has a crypto processor in a sim card, a central processor, a screen controller (but justify, the customer, that the controller is not a processor!) And also the charging controller is also quite a processor.  The only thing you have to hang an external flash drive, so that the drive was in volume. <br><br>  And how to justify the need for other parameters, given that even the requirements of GOST are not justification - I personally do not understand. <br><br>  With the rest of the computer hardware is still sad.  Notebooks, for example, cannot have processor requirements at all.  Only the amount of memory, screws and diagonal.  EVERYTHING. <br><br>  In general, we wanted the best, but it turned out as always.  If someone knows what to do with it - write. <br><br>  PS: I know that the regions are different.  Someone still boldly writes ‚ÄúI will buy a Cisco 2960X‚Äù, something in the justification of the new requirement in the TOR will write ‚Äúfor compatibility with the existing equipment‚Äù or ‚Äúfor ensuring fault tolerance‚Äù.  And someone will be asked "What kind of regulatory legal act on you is obliged to ensure the resiliency of the equipment and its compatibility with the existing one" and there will be nothing to answer. <br><br>  UPD: Clauses 5 and 6 of Resolution 145, often mentioned in the comments.  Yes you can add your requirements with justification.  The problem is that there are no criteria for the sufficiency of the justification and a sufficient regulatory framework.  All justifications are reduced to two options: "I want it so" and "I can not otherwise."  But how the regulatory authorities will see these rationales is a mystery. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/425369/">https://habr.com/ru/post/425369/</a></p>
