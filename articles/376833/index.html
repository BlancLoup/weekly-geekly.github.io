Perhaps we are in vain ahead of events, but decided to tell a little more about the project to the domestic audience before its announcement on the platform.  The first information about our project was published on <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/darta_systems/blog/249531/">Habrahabr</a> .  A little later, we decided to move here to be closer to the closer hubs on our topic.

      If you raise funds on a kickstarter, most likely your marketing budget is limited (of course, this does not apply to large companies that are laid out to get the first feedback on the product or test the demand).  And therefore a second chance to make a good video may not be presented - the money must be spent properly and only once. <br><br>  We take the liberty to tell you some useful tips that will increase the chances of achieving the desired.  These are rough touches.  They will be of little use to the pros.  But if someone gave them to amateurs like us at one time, a huge amount of nerves and time would be saved.  By the way, this is what the movie turned out for us: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/52MZrGxZLqM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgrmirfbrrS-1PON7UOYapbjSFLsA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  And here are the tips: <br><br><h5>  Tip # 1 </h5><br>  You will need money.  I risk running into a barrage of criticism, but I would advise you to reserve from 250 thousand rubles for a movie.  It's minimum. <br><br><h5>  Council number 2 </h5><br>  Define for yourself videos of projects similar to yours that will appeal to the whole team.  Get together and talk out loud, which is why you specifically liked each of the commercials.  The more rational arguments in favor of a movie are found, the better.  At this step a certain collective video-mind will be formed, which will allow to form a common point of taste reference. <br><br><h5>  Tip number 3 </h5><br>  Decide what you want to highlight in your video.  What rational and emotional component you want to lay in your video, what specific features of the product you want to convey and how to show.  What problem of the user want to solve the product?  At this stage, the collective mind must in theory grow stronger.  And the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe movie begin to overgrow with the first details. <br><br><h5>  Tip # 4 </h5><br>  Write a script before you start talking to movie studios.  Preferably, one that does not require special effects (such as "in the next frame a racing car crashes into a reinforced concrete wall at full speed").  Remember that for everything about everything there is no more than 3 minutes, to make a video of longer duration does not make sense.  It is ideal to immediately bind the action to the time axis. <br><br><h5>  Tip number 5 </h5><br>  Find someone who draws decently and make a storyboard like this one.  If you come to the studio with a storyboard - save a lot of time explaining the final result.  And greatly increase the chances that exactly what you need will be shot.  Some studios will do the storyboard for you, but it will cost extra money.  If you absolutely cannot draw at all - do not regret and pay money for others to do this (I think this is about the sum of 10 ... 20 thousand rubles).  You will not regret. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b1f/4fa/385/b1f4fa385d2c4dea84b3fd760cf7aa7a.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Tip number 6 </h5><br>  After the appearance of the storyboard, do not be lazy and make a slideshow of it (we did it in iMovie, incredibly fast and convenient).  You can visually see the sequence of scenes and put the voice-over and soundtrack right on the slideshow and decide on the final text.  It is best to see the result of the whole team and make all possible edits at once.  Remember, the more information you give the studio - the more accurately you will be given an estimate of the cost.  And the less time and money will be spent on shooting and post-production in the end. <br><br><h5>  Tip number 7 </h5><br>  Find a studio whose works you like.  Maybe not all, but most of you.  You can arrange a minitender by sending a script to the studios, a storyboard (and a slideshow if done), to request conditions on the price.  Specify whether the operator whose work you got involved will work with you.  It is important that it was him.  Handwriting operator is of great importance.  If you need to show the product in statics - settle for models (it's cheaper).  If you need to beat the situation, ask the studio to offer actors. <br><br><h5>  Tip number 8 </h5><br>  Take part in the installation.  No one except you knows exactly how best to submit your product.  Footage is usually a lot.  You can dig into it and select frames that best match your perception of the product.  By the way, if you want, the finished scenes can be swapped. <br><br><h5>  Tip number 9 </h5><br>  Be sure to do the voice acting with a professional speaker.  It is inexpensive - 10 ... 15 thousand per hour.  If you give the final text on the record, it is quite possible to keep within an hour. <br><br><h5>  Tip number 10 </h5><br>  Be sure to color-correct the assembled roller.  This is another 15 ... 20 thousand rubles.  But it costs a lot more, believe me. <br><br>  Well, that's all.  Written on the basis of a compilation of personal experience in the same breath and with maximum integrity.  We like our video, it corresponds to our perception of the product.  But if you take our advice seriously, you will get even better! <br><br>  Thank you for your attention and good luck. <br><br>  Sincerely, Darta Systems Team. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/376833/">https://habr.com/ru/post/376833/</a></p>
