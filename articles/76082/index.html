The files were on the server, where RAID was raised in a way, but due to the terminal nature of the server, the danger of virus infection, and similar factors, resiliency decreased, and the possibility of information collapse significantly increased. <br>  Now, about Synology DS409.  NAS requirements were similar to:

      ‚Ä¢ Supports RAID 0.1 <br>  ‚Ä¢ Authorization of users through Microsoft Active Directory <br>  ‚Ä¢ Linux as an OS <br>  ‚Ä¢ Ability to connect 4 hard drives (for a healthy RAID array) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Ability to connect SAS drives <br>  ‚Ä¢ Built-in FTP, gigabit interface, and other small sweets <br><br>  As you can see, the device came almost completely.  The only thing is that there is no possibility to connect SAS hard drives, which I wanted to put there.  But, fortunately (or unfortunately), due to budget constraints, this factor has ceased to be critical, so 4 Western Digital WD10EADS 1000Gb were acquired. <br>  The interface, as you can see, is rather pleasant, all transitions, as expected, are implemented via AJAX. <br><br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091123/lOfVpD0fWW.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Now about what is worth talking about. <br><br>  Root directory management takes place through the same web snout.  Rights, respectively, can be distributed only to root folders. <br><br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091123/s93NbiMgvX.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  NAS can both be turned on and off on a schedule (for example, only during working hours). <br>  The following applications are preinstalled on the NAS: iTunes, Web Station, Audio Station, Photo Station, Download Station, Surveillance Station (for IP video cameras). <br><br>  Reservation is carried out as regular means, as scheduled, and a lump sum at will. <br><br>  It is possible to connect external USB drives, printers. <br><br>  And the most important thing for me: the ability to authorize users through the Microsoft Active Directory Service. <br><br>  All the principles of our corporate network are built on integration with AD, and this device allows you to appropriately distribute the rights to directories (for example, right now the rights are distributed to division balls + shared file manager + hidden system folders with software etc.) <br><br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091123/vE67m4B9D1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  True, at least on <a href="http://www.synology.su/">the manufacturer's website the</a> built-in support for ADS was declared, at the time of purchase (August 2009) it was absent in the standard firmware, I had to roll in fresh.  But it took about 5 minutes, so that there were no problems. <br>  Setting user rights is pretty simple.  We select the type of users, we select the users themselves, we select the necessary rights (read / read / no access). <br><br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091123/HU3qq6XouU.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The device has already been running for 4 months in a constant mode; no failures were noticed even once.  The only problems that have arisen are with ADS.  Once the device simply stopped letting anyone in it.  It turned out that the NAS for some reason lost the domain.  I went to the administration panel, rewrote the domain name, entered the administrator's data - and it all worked.  All rights, fortunately, remained in place. <br><br>  The device works almost silently (for example, the nearby hanging D-Link switch makes noise 5 times louder). <br><br>  The cost of this model is ~ 17000 RUR.  I got about 30,000 RUR with disks. <br><br>  In general, I believe that this NAS is worthy of respect and I highly recommend its use. <br><br>  PS <a href="http://www.synology.su/products/22">Here</a> you can read the official information about the device. <br><br>  PPS By the way, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/57772/">here I</a> found a review of a similar device (Synology DS209 +).  You can see a more complete overview of the capabilities of the administration panel (although the versions are different, but very similar). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76082/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76082/</a></p>
