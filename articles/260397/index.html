  <section class="page js-page"><h1>SQA Days-17: with the best memories - to the next conference</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On May 29-30, SQA Days was held in Minsk - the International Conference on Software Quality.  She was already the seventeenth in a row and gathered more than 600 visitors from different countries.  The organizers, the Testing Laboratory, did not disappoint the regular guests of the conference, nor those who visited it for the first time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9aa/914/596/9aa914596a0540aea7446beb2dcf13e1.png"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In just two days, 67 speakers from the USA, Great Britain, Czech Republic, Russia, Ukraine and Belarus spoke at the conference.  They shared their experience gained on a large number of diverse projects, including banking software and enterprise systems, social networks and video services, mobile applications and websites, and even a platform for making decisions of national importance.

      For the first time, two large international testing authorities, Rex Black (USA) and Paul Gerrard (United Kingdom) spoke at SQA Days.  Each of the conference participants received a small black ‚ÄúPocket Book Tester‚Äù by Paul Gerrard as a gift, and in the breaks between the reports, all the speakers, including the most famous, were happy to answer all those who wished. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ed1/9f5/d9a/ed19f5d9a8f44a55b0949e162ec56aa7.png"><br><br>  <i>Paul Gerrard on the sidelines</i> <br><br>  One of the main trends of the conference was a systematic understanding of what quality assurance is.  ‚ÄúWe need no testing, we need QA‚Äù - this was mentioned by the Czech guest Vojtech Barth, and Alexey Alekseev, who spoke about the DevOps processes, and many others.  The current perspective of the testing process includes the technical infrastructure, the architecture of software solutions, and much more.  An unusual example of a task that will soon become routine for quality assurance specialists has become the ‚ÄúInternet of Things‚Äù, or rather, the ‚ÄúInternet of everything‚Äù (Paul of Gerrard) in his key report. <br><br>  Another important trend is the desire for development, the introduction of relevant and effective tools, and the transition to a new level is not always easy.  Examples are the transfer of knowledge in large international projects, the training of a new generation of testers, the implementation of Agile and its benefits, and, of course, test automation, in favor of which several well-reasoned reports were made.  To many listeners, Natalya Rukol‚Äôs emotional and motivating talk about how our mistakes turn us into even stronger professionals has sunk into the soul. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e1d/9ae/fbb/e1d9aefbb2304e4381a3c23c7b68ce5a.png"><br><br>  <i>Natalia Rukol: do not be afraid to step on the rake!</i> <br><br>  The conference ended with the awarding of the best presentations according to the audience (as is customary at SQA Days, the most experienced speakers and regular guests of the conference did not participate in the competition).  The first place was won by the report of Alexandra Volkova "10 principles of automation, which I will not betray", second place was taken by Alexey Ljanguzov ("Talk about test data"), and the third place was taken by Alexander Martinovich with the report "How methods of natural sciences can help in testing."  All of them received commemorative prizes from the organizers, and then among all the attendees of the conference a small lottery was held, also with valuable prizes. <br><br>  Two days, three streams of reports, a wide variety of topics ‚Äî such intensive work is impossible without a good rest.  At a party in honor of SQA Days, the well-known group ‚ÄúTrubetskoy‚Äù performed for the guests of the conference, and all those who came to Minsk from afar had a great opportunity to stroll around the city in beautiful, truly summer weather. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c78/945/b55/c78945b55a454c00abe785f258d52b08.png"><br><br>  <i>Group ‚ÄúTrubetskoy‚Äù at a party in honor of SQA Days</i> <br><br>  The next SQA Days conference will be held on November 27-28, 2015 in Moscow. <br><br>  Photos from the conference can be found here: <br>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/%3Fset%3Da.469075223257297.1073741839.247977782033710">www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.469075223257297.1073741839.247977782033710</a> <br>  <a href="https://vk.com/album-27699095_217084295">vk.com/album-27699095_217084295</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://vimeo.com/129751808">Review</a> video: <a href="https://vimeo.com/129751808">vimeo.com/129751808</a> <br>  All presentations are already available at the following link: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/VLDCORP/presentations">www.slideshare.net/VLDCORP/presentations</a> <br>  Video recordings of the reports will soon be available here: <a href="https://vimeo.com/orlikov">vimeo.com/orlikov</a> <br><br>  Learn more about the conference on the official website: <a href="http://www.sqadays.com/">www.sqadays.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/260397/">https://habr.com/ru/post/260397/</a></p>
