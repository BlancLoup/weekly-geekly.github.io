The vulnerability, which is used by attackers, was discovered in April, and the company itself <a href="https://blog.mikrotik.com/security/winbox-vulnerability.html">has long released a</a> patch to fix the problem. <br><br>  But thousands of routers are still vulnerable now, because nobody updates their firmware - many companies and ordinary private users simply do not pay attention to this aspect.  As for the total number of routers, about 7.5 thousand devices were compromised (what the experts found).  In general, the network still operates about 370,000 routers, the vulnerability in the software that has not yet been fixed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Malefactors collect data of users of the cracked devices, redirecting the received information on the servers.  By the way, about 239,000 routers have been turned into SOCKS 4 proxies, which are easily accessible.

      As for the company MikroTik, it provides wireless equipment and software for it, supplying systems for both business and individuals.  Latvian company devices are actively used by large network service providers.  Most of the devices from this manufacturer are physically located in Brazil and Russia.  A lot of them in the United States. <br><br>  By the way, the Chinese are not the first who drew attention to the problem with Mirotik routers - earlier representatives of Trustwave drew attention to the malware attack on these devices.  Vulnerability in network device software became known after a Vault7 leak.  Initially, the attackers injected Coinhive JavaScrip onto an error page, embedded in the router, then all web requests were redirected to this page.  But the developers of the first malware for routers made a mistake, and blocked access to external pages for requests that are already being executed using a hacked device. <br><br>  The second attack <a href="https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:Winbox">discovered</a> by the Netlab 360 team turned the hacked network devices into a malicious proxy network using the SOCKS4 protocol for a non-standard TCP port (4153).  And access in this case is open only for devices from a very limited range of IP addresses, 95.154.216.128/25.  Almost all traffic was sent to 95.154.216.167, the address that is associated with the hosting service, which is located in the UK. <br><br>  So far it is not clear what exactly the hacked rotors are used for.  Perhaps in order to search for other vulnerable devices. <br><br>  As for the new problem with MikroTik, in this case a sniffer based on the TZSP protocol is used.  It is able to send packets to remote systems using Wireshark or its analogs.  The 7500 compromised routers mentioned above forwarded network traffic, mainly FTP and e-mail.  Also, a small amount of data related to remote control of network devices was noted, but for a narrow IP sample.  Most data packets are sent to an IP provider from Belize. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e91/5ea/78b/e915ea78b44fec3717cb16578f199dac.png"><br><br>  This is not the only attack of this kind.  Last month, <a href="https://habr.com/post/420221/">it became aware</a> of a group of intruders that exploited a vulnerability in another manufacturer‚Äôs router, Dlink.  In this case, cybercriminals could remotely change the settings of the router's DNS service in order to redirect the user of the device to a resource that was created by the hackers themselves. <br><br>  Router models such as DLink DSL-2740R, DSL-2640B, DSL-2780B, DSL-2730B and DSL-526B are subject to vulnerabilities.  It has already been mentioned above that very few people follow the software update of routers, except for organizations where it is critically important (and not always), so that compromised routers can work for a very long time without detecting a problem.  The August attack on Dlink was aimed at the clients of the two largest Brazilian banks - Banco de Brasil and Unibanco. <br><br>  The attackers forged the websites of banks and redirected users to copies.  As a result, unsuspecting victims entered the access data and thereby transmitted this information to cybercriminals. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422719/">https://habr.com/ru/post/422719/</a></p>
