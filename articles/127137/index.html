Applicants needed to answer a series of questions about internet marketing.  More than three hundred volunteers took part in the competition! <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/248/593/102/24859310286d539cd86027ab4dc7aaee.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  1.

      Gave the widest and most complete answer to the first question.  Highlighting the task that each of the channels will solve added it all with pluses and minuses for each specific task. <br><br><h4>  2. Andrei Burmus </h4><br><br>  Andrei answered the second question most completely: he described all the necessary metrics that play a direct role in the generation of profits. <br><br><h4>  3. Alexey Borttsov </h4><br><br>  Alexey distinguished himself in both the first and second questions, predicting the influence of the channel and the metrics he used in solving the problem. <br><br>  I would like to separately note that there are no first, second or any other places, the best participants are equally interested in the questions.  And now our comments on the questions and some answers. <br><br>  <b>Question 1.</b> <br><br>  <i>Suppose that you consider attracting users from several sources for booking on the site.</i>  <i>You can choose any two of them (where the cost of each channel is the same) one month after the start.</i>  <i>Which two do you choose?</i>  <i>Explain why?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Variants of answers:</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>but.</i>  <i>100,000 visits with PR</i> <i><br></i>  <i>(articles for journalists);</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>b.</i>  <i>100,000 visits with contextual</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Yandex advertising;</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>at.</i>  <i>100,000 visits with contextual</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Google ads;</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>100,000 ad visits</i> <i><br></i>  <i>In contact with.</i> <br><br>  a.  An excellent channel at the start, if you have a hundred thousand press transitions, and especially from popular sources relating to your industry or with a wide range of topics.  You get a huge level of press attention with a lasting effect.  Also, this channel lays, one might say, the first brick of your brand. <br><br>  b.  Yandex in Russia is much more widely represented than Google, easy to scale, flexibly configured, in general a very good tool for both direct sales and for maintaining one-time actions. <br><br>  c.  In order to embrace the greatest amount of search traffic, you should not lose sight of Google - it has a second market share.  Google, in particular, is useful due to its media network.  But if your business is aimed primarily at the Russian market, then it is better not to use it as a main tool. <br><br>  d.  Vkontakte is quite an interesting channel, due to its huge and long-excised traffic.  Many speak about a young audience, yes, it is present and often it is a minus.  BUT, if you look at it from the other side, it lends itself to the ‚Äúright‚Äù saturation of the subscriber base, if in your case this is important.  It is worth comprehending the statistics that less than 1% of purchases come from social networks.  In particular, it refers to the inherently expensive goods / services.  If you are advertising a site with unusual gifts, Vkontakte can help with this, and if a car or equipment is above 10,000 rubles, it is unlikely. <br><br>  Of the three hundred candidates, there were some rather ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù questions, striking in their logic, closely related to the ‚Äúvalidity‚Äù of what was said. <br><br>  For example: <br><br><blockquote>  Here I give preference to Google, as a service that in Russia is used mainly by a younger and, therefore, more advanced audience than in comparison with Yandex. </blockquote><br><br>  How is this supported by numbers and is this ‚Äúyoung advanced audience‚Äù necessary? <br><br><blockquote>  r and in, vkontakte has a huge number of users, where every 3 according to statistics goes on advertising.  "In" I bet on Google, the ability to attract English-speaking users.  Thanks to Chrome, the number of users is constantly increasing.  The level of service that attracts users. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br>  For what purposes do we need every third person who clicks thoughtlessly on an advertisement?  Google Chrome?  - How does this directly affect sales? <br><br>  And just a great answer: <br><br><blockquote>  I would choose items "a" and "in."  I have never paid attention to advertising in Yandex and Vkontakte. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Question 2.</b> <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúIf you could collect any information about users who came to the site from the above channels in order to improve your product, what would it be and why?‚Äù</i> <br><br>  One answer: <br><br><blockquote>  1. Is the user a girlfriend?  (It‚Äôs a girl, not a girl, woman, or grandmother) <br>  2. If item 1 is executed: <br>  2.1 Breast size <br>  2.2 External non-repelling condition " </blockquote><br><br>  The information necessary after any advertising campaign should be comparable to the business goals. ‚ÄúBreast size‚Äù will not give an answer whether it is worth continuing to work with this channel in the future or what buying potential of this site.  If only very indirectly :) <br><br>  Decisions are made on the basis of data: conversion, subscriber cost or final conversion, as well as a number of indicators affecting CPC, CTR. <br><br>  Thanks to everyone who participated!  Correctly set your goals, collect data that you really need. <br><br>  Respectfully, <br>  Team Ostrovok.ru </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127137/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127137/</a></p>
