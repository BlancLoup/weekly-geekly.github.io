  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Kommersant" learns the "secret of the company"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="http://www.sf-online.ru/">The Sekret</a> Firmy Publishing House went to the media holdings of Alisher Usmanov, who already has one ID, <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/">Kommersan</a> .  Sources <a href="http://rian.ru/">of RIA Novosti</a> , who announced the completion of the transaction, estimate the amount of the transaction at $ 45-50 million. <br><br>  Most of this money, according to insiders, is <a href="http://www.gazeta.ru/">Gazeta.Ru</a> .  It was reported that the buyer was ready to pay $ 30 million for it. <a href="http://www.vzglyad.ru/economy/2006/11/24/58479.html">“Vzglyad”</a> reports that the deal on the purchase of the publication is “already closed”, but there is no official confirmation of this — Alisher Usmanov has not yet commented on the event.  Representatives of Gazeta.Ru themselves said a few days ago that neither external nor internal signs of selling are visible. <br><br>  Analysts believe that the likely $ 30 million for Gazeta.ru, is too large a sum.  They recall that in 2005 “The Secret of the Firm” itself, buying this online media, paid $ 7-10 million. “Just six months ago, auditors estimated the resource at $ 18 million,” Vzglyad quotes its sources.  And <a href="http://finam.ru/">Finam</a> investment holding estimates Gazeta.Ru as a business at $ 14 million. “However, with the approaching elections, as well as the growing attention that Kremlin political technologists pay to the Internet, the value of the asset may be higher,” Finana expert Elina said Karaev.  - In this case, this is not a business, but a political resource.  The current establishment has enough money, it can afford to overpay. ”

      “Gazeta.Ru is a strong informational Internet resource, one of the most promoted and influential,” explains Elina Karaeva’s investor interest in the deal.  - Now the situation is such that the interest of offline media holdings to Runet has grown noticeably, they are seeking to incorporate online media into their structure.  Creating your own resources is expensive, easier to buy. ” <br><br>  She added that it is not quite clear yet why Usmanov needs the whole “Secret of the Firm”, because the Kommersant Publishing House already has a strong business magazine, and other projects of the “Secret of the Firm” are only leaving the startup stage.  “If the question of a deal is really worth it, then we cannot exclude such a situation: the owners want to sell the entire ID entirely, refusing to sell projects separately,” the expert said.  Recall, in addition to Gazety.Ru and business journal of the same name with the title ID, “The Secret of the Firm” publishes the “You Have the Right” and “Everything Is Clear” weeklies.  The company’s assets included the newspaper <a href="http://www.b-online.ru/">Business</a> , but in October the unprofitable publication was sold to Rodionov’s publishing house - according to unofficial data, for $ 6 million. <br><br>  The amount of $ 45-50 million for the whole of the publishing house "The Secret of the Firm" "Finam" finds quite adequate.  Other experts believe that this is “a very high price.”  “For such a price, the co-owners of Sekret Firmy need to agree to negotiate,” said Konstantin Isakov, general director of the consulting company Mediamark.  In his opinion, the high valuation of the business of the Sekret Firmy is explained by the shortage of standing publishing houses in Russia.  "To talk about a fair price in this case is meaningless," he said.  “There are multipliers on the market.” <br><br>  Together with the commercial party of the transaction, its potential impact directly on the work of the two IDs is discussed.  So, <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article.shtml%3F2006/11/27/116512">Vedomosti</a> reports that this is also a corporate merger.  “Kommersant” keeps silent about this, but Demian Kudryavtsev, the general director of the publishing house, acknowledged that the company is planning to expand by buying new media assets.  “Kommersant Publishing House has a large development program, supported by a shareholder,” he said.  “First of all, we would like to increase our presence in the niche where we ourselves are strong.” <br><br>  Experts note that the product of both IDs is very high quality, and, in addition, it is possible that the powerful advertising machine Kommersant will improve the financial performance of the "Secret of the Company."  RIA Novosti reports that, maybe, both IDs will remain to a certain extent independent structures, but they will have one management company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4729/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4729/</a></p>
