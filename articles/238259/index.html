  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Electric cars in Europe: IBM Cloud as an IT platform for the Green eMotion project</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/de0/1bd/555/de01bd555e094e3388697d9d37b35925.jpg"><br><br>  Now many companies are going to release (or have already released) their own version of the electric car on the market.  Among the first, of course, Tesla Motors, the company, thanks to which electric vehicles became not only practical, but also stylish.  Then come BMW, Renault, Toyota, Nissan and all the other automakers.  The number of electric vehicles is constantly growing: according to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, about 1 million electric vehicles will be traveling in this country alone by 2020. <br><br>  Of course, there will be even more electric cars in the whole of Europe, and for their normal operation, electric gas stations and an IT platform for partners' communication, cooperation and provision of services related to electric vehicles are needed.

      To create such a platform in 2012 was founded the <a href="http://www.greenemotion-project.eu/">Green eMotion</a> project, which is successfully developing.  The basis of the project is the IBM Cloud service. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/978/9cd/77d/9789cd77d6014c49ac51025bf0c29d50.png">  In total, Green eMotion has 43 partners, including industry representatives, universities, research organizations, energy companies, and government agencies.  Thanks to the work of all partners, a developed infrastructure of gas stations for electric vehicles appeared and develops in Europe, as well as related services. <br><br>  The Green eMotion team has developed a cloud-based information and communication platform to ensure the operation of the entire infrastructure for electric vehicles.  Green eMotion includes: <br><ul><li>  Service providers; </li><li>  Electric vehicle manufacturers; </li><li>  Electro-gas station operators; </li><li>  Authorities; </li><li>  Power companies; </li><li>  Electric car drivers. </li></ul><br><br>  IBM is responsible for the IT infrastructure of the Green eMotion project.  Due to this, in a short time it was possible to develop various specifications of standards, protocols and the core of developing service standards, to unify the description of service work for electric vehicles.  Using the created platform, you can buy, sell and manage Green eMotion market services. <br><br><h3>  IBM SmartCloud Role </h3><br><br>  The entire Green eMotion IT infrastructure is based on <a href="http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/us/en/">IBM SmartCloud</a> , which makes the project platform flexible enough, scalable and customizable. <br><br>  Any project partner has the ability to work with the IBM SmartCloud cloud, as well as scale its resources without the need for manual configuration - everything is done automatically, in the Green eMotion / IBM SmartCloud platform environment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/27a/ee4/93b/27aee493b22347aeb7150b056d310e3e.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Advantages of the Green eMotion platform </h3><br><br>  The Green eMotion platform provides the following features for various project participants: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Drivers of electric vehicles: charging the battery of their electric vehicles anywhere in Europe, regardless of the company - owner of the charging station.  Locating the nearest station with information about available points for connection, form of payment or cost of service. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Energy companies: a single communication channel, work standards, which reduces operating costs, including the need to create your own financial environment or service support.  Increased charging infrastructure efficiency, less bureaucratic downtime. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Electro-gas station operators: compatible standards for charging stations and payment systems, the ability to obtain information from project analytical services, less bureaucracy. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Service providers: scalable cloud environment for communication with various services and service platforms, compatible standards for services and payment systems, development of new and improved existing solutions, less bureaucracy. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Government agencies: continuous monitoring of CO2 emissions, a gradual decrease in air pollution, an increase in the number of electric vehicles on the roads, less bureaucracy. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/14_8hZA_sp8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgrT-nyXq2qGFQ3uK0Hij8JhWKtbA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/238259/">https://habr.com/ru/post/238259/</a></p>
