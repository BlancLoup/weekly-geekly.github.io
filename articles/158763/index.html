  <section class="page js-page"><h1>ImageCMS 4.0b Release - New Interface and Functional Flexibility</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e7f/4c3/381/e7f4c3381f90980d4d20e960405618ad.jpg">  For the last six weeks, our team has completely devoted to translating the wishes of ImageCMS users.  All these wishes boil down to the fact that managing an online store becomes a concise, flexible and functional process.  The 4.0b ImageCMS and ImageCMS Shop release is our implementation of these solutions. <br>  This version is key to the development of the system, since one correct vector has been chosen for the subsequent development of new features, modules and templates, and the setting of a flexible update system. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The adaptability of the design of the administrative part has become for us one of the main projections of development - today we cannot ignore this issue in the context of usability of the interface.  The ability to work with the administrative part of the site or shop based on mobile devices is becoming increasingly popular for the modern person. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3fb/b0e/cc1/3fbb0ecc1c65a6cd12a29dd63835c432.png"><br>  Another direction actively worked out by our team in this release is SEO goals.  Correct, structured HTML code helps to optimize the process of promoting your website and online store. <br><br><h2>  Let's go over the key features of the new version of the system. </h2><br><h3>  1. Bootstrap &amp; Jquery </h3><br>  To build the administrative part of the interfaces used Bootstrap - a <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/components.html">framework from Twitter</a> .  This tool allows you to quickly and conveniently create templates for modules of the ImageCMS system.  In addition, the process of adding and customizing existing solutions is as easy as creating your own solutions.  The framework supports the features of HTML5, CSS3. <br>  In previous releases, up to version 4.0b, we used mootools and mochaui to build the UI.  This greatly limited us in terms of flexibility and scaling.  Changing the underlying principles of the mochaui user interface library was quite a laborious task. <br>  Bootstrap is a powerful designer tool that will help you quickly respond to your wishes and comments on further improving the interface. <br>  Along with Bootstrap, there is also support for the Jquery library.  We write less - do more!  Create your own modules, make adjustments to the existing interface using Twitter Bootstrap and Jquery. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b9c/d88/2ee/b9cd882eeddafefe2db89b3a5119b8e7.png"><br><br><h3>  2. Changes in the interface </h3><br><ul><li>  added more autocomplete fields and convenient filters to all sites, the search in which could be difficult due to the large amount of content. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3e3/2d8/2ac/3e32d82acb13b225633819d67a20f47d.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c2a/579/c83/c2a579c83c80ed8fd06ae7f46996d4f8.png"></li><li>  worked through the product list view - now there is a quick access to the filter (in the previous version it was not available at all).  Make the necessary changes even faster, set statuses and adjust prices directly from the list.  Manipulations are also available for many products - just tick and apply an action from the top menu. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c93/d18/c05/c93d18c05e1a2a603eda44cfa564ce7d.png"></li><li>  for convenience, the top menu is now fixed on top of the working area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe browser, even after scrolling the page. </li></ul>

        </script>
      <br>
    <h3>  3. Orders </h3><br>  We have added tools that make the process of order management even easier.  Apply filters by date, status, customer, product and order amount.  Also use information tools such as a quick review of the contents of the order, and make changes to orders already completed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/948/774/dc2/948774dc271173cf9e16fd919ef3cf0d.png"><br><br><h3>  4. CSV-import of goods </h3><br>  The new product database approach for ImageCMS Shop is via CSV.  Now we suggest using one of three slots for storing files. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/495/02c/7c3/49502c7c3e92c60437d659c91ce4f4be.png"><br>  Files are checked and stored in the backups folder.  The time of instantiation is indicated next to each of them - you can return to each file at any time if necessary. <br>  Based on the selected slot, a string of fields is formed for unloading to the storefront.  From the indicated slot, the first line is read, on the basis of which it is now possible to visually establish correspondences.  Simply select from the list of available values ‚Äã‚Äãand start the import. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0fa/45b/0af/0fa45b0afef1fe6fb3e239b438aac08f.png"><br><br><h3>  5. Hot keys </h3><br>  We have already taken the first step - the ctrl + S function is now at your disposal.  We will work actively on the hotkey map in the near foreseeable future. <br><br><h3>  6. Module ‚ÄúGallery‚Äù </h3><br>  This module has transferred several aesthetic adjustments: <br><ul><li>  updated and improved the interface; </li><li>  developed multi-image upload (HTML5); </li><li>  launched the drug &amp; drop function. </li></ul><br>  We also worked to make managing the contents of the module as convenient as possible - now you can sort categories, albums and photos. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/25d/ce1/c04/25dce1c04ed6c99f70237e3fe2a2fa75.jpg"><br><br><h3>  7. Module ‚ÄúComments‚Äù </h3><br>  Improvements to this module also mainly concern convenience and optimization of work with comments: <br><ul><li>  developed a more functional interface; </li><li>  launched the ability to work with comments directly from the list page; </li><li>  added a function for changing the status of a comment; </li><li>  provided comments microdata support. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/280/643/6b3/2806436b3cf66f32b5ce06678e2e5e21.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to innovations, we also worked on existing bugs.  In the new version, we have destroyed the following ‚Äúproblem areas‚Äù: <br><ul><li>  filters.  Rewrote the part responsible for working with the database - now requests come much faster, the number of competitive requests has also decreased; </li><li>  list of comparisons.  Altered the logic of functioning - the ‚ÄúOnly differences‚Äù button works; </li><li>  brand view page.  Added sorting by rating, quantity on the product page of this brand - on the left all categories are displayed where the requested brand is found; </li><li>  browse categories.  They solved the problems of choosing the option, filtering by price, displaying the old price, adding labels (‚ÄúAction‚Äù, ‚ÄúHit‚Äù, ‚ÄúNovelty‚Äù). </li></ul><br>  In addition, fixed bugs associated with the ordering. <br><br>  We offer to personally verify the result of our work - take a test drive release on the <a href="http://www.imagecms.net/demos-page">demo version</a> and make your own decision regarding ImageCMS 4.0b.  Feedback and suggestions are welcome in the comments and on <a href="http://www.imagecms.net/blog/news/reliz-imagecms-40b-novyi-interfeis-i-gibkost-funktsionala">our blog</a> ! <br><br>  <b>PS</b> We are already working hard on the next release of the system, which will include new features and add-ons that are not included in the starting ImageCMS 4.0b. <br>  Recall, ImageCMS is a powerful free open-source tool for creating corporate websites, ImageCMS Shop is a flexible system for managing online stores. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/158763/">https://habr.com/ru/post/158763/</a></p>
