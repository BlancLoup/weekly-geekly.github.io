    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  ASUS has great plans to conquer the world.  They decided to rely on this difficult matter for the most loyal audience - gamers.  The company brought a number of products targeted at this audience to the CeBIT exhibition: Republic of Gamers (ROG) series notebooks, high-performance motherboards, video cards, and 3D monitors. <br><br>  <b>ROG G Gaming Laptops</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ed5/b27/51c/ed5b2751cc278a59e94ce920ce930b6c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The flagship is the ASUS G74Sx laptop based on the Huron River mobile platform with the new Intel Sandy Bridge processors.  The platform provides 1080p video transmission to an external source without wires, native support for Bluetooth, SATA 6.0 Gbps.  At the same time, the Huron River platform is energy efficient compared to the previous generation. <br><br>  The device is equipped with a yet unannounced GeForce GTX 560M video card, which supports NVIDIA 3D Vision technology with a frequency of 120 Hz, 17-inch matrix with a resolution of 1980 √ó 1024 and support for three-dimensional image without the use of glasses, a backlit keyboard, a Core i5 or i7 processor, up to 16 GB RAM, integrated webcam, and HDMI 1.4. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f7e/ffe/4f1/f7effe4f186402f47b8cb6be9dc30161.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The other model presented, the ROG G53, differs from the previous one by a 15-screen display and a lower screen resolution (1366 x 768).  Combining a stepped lens technology with AUO's eye movement tracking system, the G53 laptop has no ‚Äúdead zones‚Äù, producing a stereoscopic image that maintains depth when viewed from any angle.  In addition, the simultaneous output of two-dimensional and three-dimensional images is supported, therefore the text on the screen of this display will always be clear and easily distinguishable. <br><br>  <b>Extremely fast motherboard ROG Rampage III Black Edition</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/639/708/e12/639708e121103bdd17037651c76f5644.jpg" alt="image">  ] <br><br>  This motherboard will appeal to all overclockers.  It follows in the footsteps of the Rampage III Extreme model, which set new records in overclocking computers, the ROG Rampage III Black Edition motherboard complements the capabilities of its predecessor with a whole range of hardware and software improvements, as well as a stylish design. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/575/287/59b/57528759b1b4cc81e1b5dc63a16722b4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>3D Monitor VG278H</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8a3/aa1/1fc/8a3aa11fcb61a13fe79cc281a846ac3b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Posh 27-inch monitor VG278H with LED backlight.  It connects to a video card with support for stereoscopic image technology via HDMI 1.4 interface and is equipped with a built-in infrared transmitter, allowing you to get a real three-dimensional image without any wires. <br><br>  And of course, everyone has recently been interested in ASUS tablet computers. <br><br>  <b>ASUS Eee Slate EP 121</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f6f/bd5/249/f6fbd5249420c02ecdc2563016892c43.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So, its characteristics: 4 GB of memory, Intel Core i5 processor, 32 or 64 GB SSD, 12-inch screen.  But the most important thing is the price!  On Amazon, the device is available in two versions: 32 GB $ 969, 64 GB $ 1099.  In my opinion, very good for such capacities. <br><br>  The tablet comes with the operating system Windows 7 (Home Premium), which simultaneously adds both pluses and minuses.  In Windows 7, working with multitouch technology is implemented in all versions except ‚ÄúInitial‚Äù and ‚ÄúBasic‚Äù.  The system is successfully adapted, and the tablet will not yield to the ease of use of systems based on Android or iOS.  There is a certain problem of software, "sharpened" under the capabilities of the touch screen.  Specially developed applications, as for iOS and Android, are not there at all, but the situation will start to change as soon as tablets on Windows 7 begin to conquer the market. <br><br>  However, comparing ASUS Eee Slate with other tablet models is not entirely correct.  Rather, it is a full-fledged netbook (or even a laptop, judging by the TTX), made in the tablet form factor.  According to the official website of ASUS, "the device is supplied with a lightweight and comfortable keyboard with a wireless interface."  The user gets a full-fledged tablet with all the features of Windows, on which, for the first time, it becomes really convenient not only to have fun, but also to work. <br><br>  The description of the tablet has already been added to the ASUS website, so I advise you to <a href="http://ru.asus.com/product.aspx%3FP_ID%3DQhWKR7Fmv4jDLbBY">read it there</a> . <br><br>  <b>WAVI Xtion</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6ec/e29/274/6ece292741e2f6d3b76c1d563bb3dbef.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Another new product that ASUS introduced at CeBIT is a motion recognition device.  The functionality of the system is similar to Microsoft Kinect for Xbox 360, but now it acts on a PC.  A practical implementation is a peripheral device that allows you to control a computer with simple gestures and movements. <br><br>  WAVI is a wireless media stream transmitter in HD quality.  Xtion - a sensor that tracks movement.  The device operates as follows: while you are, for example, in front of a large TV, WAVI transmits media data from a computer to the screen.  The device uses the WHDI wireless video transmission standard, which has a range of 25 meters. <br><br>  WAVI Xtion is equipped with HDMI, has 2 USB ports, can transmit eight-channel audio and video stream with a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels.  Xtion works if the player is from the device at a distance of 80 cm to 3.5 m. <br><br>  And one more novelty from ASUS.  At first glance it seems that this is a good joke, but before April 1 it is still far away, so there is every reason to believe our eyes. <br><br>  <b>Eco-Friendly Computer</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fd9/86c/b6e/fd986cb6e84c42da7bdbd964b19dcd0f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This product is difficult to assess unequivocally, but it will definitely appeal to all fans of modding.  ASUS plans to supply Mini ATX motherboards in cardboard boxes from which it will be possible to make a system unit.  The box includes all the necessary holes and connectors.  Now you can great save on the computer case!  Surprise your friends and girlfriends, indicate your attitude towards saving the environment, and just show a good sense of humor. <br><br>  In the sample presented at the exhibition, in addition to the motherboard, fit a 64 GB solid-state drive and an optical drive.  Apparently, the Intel Atom chip with integrated graphics was used as a processor. <br><br>  By the way, I was told that ASUS is not the first mover in this business.  It turns out that Habr√© already had a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/the_future_is_here/89542/">post about cardboard systemists</a> . <br><br>  These are the new products that await us in the near future from ASUS.  I personally will look forward to the tablet and cardboard system unit. <br><br>  <b>PS Taking this opportunity, we congratulate all women on the holiday!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/115087/">https://habr.com/ru/post/115087/</a></p>
