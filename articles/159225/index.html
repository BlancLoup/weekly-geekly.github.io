  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Start OpenSource Project</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I think each of you at least once faced with the question of choosing a project management system for your own needs or the needs of a group of developers.  And they probably had to try several different systems before settling on a more or less suitable one, and sometimes some would sit down to write their bike instead.  So, I also encountered this problem and not even more than once.  It always happened that I was the initiator and organizer of the teams to develop several medium projects.  And I was responsible for the organization of the working environment, including the SUP.  But I could not find for myself a completely suitable solution. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  All the moss of trial and error in this direction is enough for a separate article, but the goal of this topic is completely different.  Therefore, I will only briefly describe some of what I have tried and what exactly I did not like, so that you could better imagine what I am talking about. <br><br>  1. Redmine.  The system is excellent in functionality, it works fast, has many modules, has a nice interface, is free.  Unconditional leader.  Did not like: the complexity of installation, migration and updates.  I am only a php-programmer and I have mediocre administration skills that will fit the LAMP or MySQL settings.  But the Ruby application for me was complicated.  In debian, apt-get install solves many problems, but the distributions are old.  Install from the source - I would not want to.  In general, many problems had to be solved and lost a lot of time before redmine was installed and put into operation. <br>  2. Trac.  Not a bad system.  There is everything you need for a small team working on one or more projects.  But the same problem with installation and hyphenation.  Of course rtfm, google and some mother helped solve all the problems, but again wasting time and installing additional packages on the server. <br>  3. Mantis.  This is a bug tracker as everyone knows, but it can be used simply as a task manager.  I didn‚Äôt like it: disgusting appearance, my eyes get tired, porridge inside (I wanted to finish a little under myself, since it was written in php), in order to change the skin, you need to rewrite almost the entire product, there is no wiki. <br>  4. JIRA.  I can not say anything bad, except that the system is paid and, again, this is primarily a bug tracker. <br>  5. TeamLab.  In the SaaS version it works very slowly, sometimes it falls off without warning.  Still, more sharpened by CRM.  In the case of deploying "at home" you need an expensive windows hosting. <br>  Next came Megaplan and Bitrix, about which nobody needs to say anything and everyone knows everything, and many more systems that I didn‚Äôt even try. <br><br>  As a result, all the systems that I tried were basically the same problems: either the complexity of installation and transfer, or insufficient functionality, or payment, or just the SaaS version.

      <br>
      What I see the system for myself: <br>  1. php + mysql (or other database supported by PDO). <br>  2. Installation is reduced to a simple launch of Install.php in the archive previously unpacked on the hosting. <br>  3. transfer can be stupidly copied, ideally a built-in utility that first makes an archive of files and databases, and then expands it to a new location (in one CMS, whose name is not called out loud, there is such a very convenient system). <br>  4. ease of development and implementation of skins. <br>  5. high speed <br>  6. tasks, projects, categories of tasks, project versions, wiki, timeline, etc. from the main required set. <br>  7. api for writing extensions. <br>  8. is free. <br><br>  Thus, we get a system that can easily and quickly be deployed almost anywhere almost by any php programmer and will provide the functionality necessary for work.  So that at the beginning of work on the next project, to think only about the project, and not on organizational issues.  Unfortunately, there is no such system at the moment. <br><br>  And I was about to sit down to write my bicycle, but then I thought: this will really be another bike, which will most likely remain within my walls and will not bring benefit to anyone else and will not solve all the problems I encountered. I, and probably will die before reaching the finish line stupidly due to lack of time.  Besides, during development I‚Äôm surely I‚Äôll unwittingly make corrections for my needs and from the heap of ideas only the most necessary ones will be implemented. <br>  So I decided to start a lot more from the open source project.  I must say that at the moment this is just an idea and nothing more.  Before starting to do something, I sent several invitations to participate to my friends and acquaintances, and now I turn to the habrasoobshchestvu with two questions: <br>  1. Does anyone else need such a project besides me? <br>  2. Are there any ones among those who would like to participate? <br><br>  If it turns out that such a project is really needed and there are several people willing to participate, then from me the organization of work (repositories, hosting, domain, etc.) and also full participation in the development. <br><br>  ZY  The writer of articles from me is unimportant, unfortunately, he set out as best he could. <br><br>  UPD: If you are willing, then organize a brainstorming project details. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/159225/">https://habr.com/ru/post/159225/</a></p>
