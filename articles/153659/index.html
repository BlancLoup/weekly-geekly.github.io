  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Lazy hGetContents. Bug or feature? (Haskell)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I have been worried about one topic for a long time.  So I decided to speak out and hear what people think about it.  It's about the <i>hGetContents</i> function.  If you have ever worked with files, then you know that this function returns the contents of a file (stream).  Here is a typical example of using this feature. <br><pre><code class="haskell hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span></span> System.IO main = do file &lt;- openFile "1.txt" ReadMode content &lt;- hGetContents file print content hClose file <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">-- :     </span></span></code> </pre> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Everything is very trite - open the file, read the contents, display on the screen, close the file.  The feature of <i>hGetContents</i> (or, more precisely, the Haskell-th feature) is that it is lazy.  Namely, the data from the file are not immediately counted as a whole, but will be read as necessary.  For example, such a program <br><pre> <code class="haskell hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span></span> System.IO main = do file &lt;- openFile "1.txt" ReadMode content &lt;- hGetContents file print $ take 3 content hClose file <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">-- :   3     </span></span></code> </pre><br>  counts from the file only the first 3 characters. <br>  What can I say, great feature!  It is very convenient to operate on the <i>content</i> variable (the contents of the file), but at the same time know that Haskell will take from it only what is needed and nothing superfluous. <br>  Now consider the following example. <br><pre> <code class="haskell hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span></span> System.IO main = do file &lt;- openFile "1.txt" ReadMode content &lt;- hGetContents file hClose file print content <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">-- :   </span></span></code> </pre><br>  Here we just rearranged the last two lines.  The result will be the displayed blank line.  Why did this happen?  The reason is that we are trying to access the contents of the file after the file is already closed.  When <i>hGetContents was</i> called <i>, the</i> data was not read anywhere, just in the <i>content</i> variable some reference to this file was kept.  And then, when we needed the content <i>content</i> , it turned out that the file was already closed. <br>  Well, so what, you think, just need to use the <i>content</i> variable before closing the file. <br><br>  The problem here is that we cannot ‚Äúforce‚Äù Haskell to calculate the <i>content</i> variable before the file is closed (if someone knows a way, write).  For example, we need to write a function that opens a file, reads the contents, parses some structure, closes the file, and returns the resulting structure as a result. <br><pre> <code class="haskell hljs"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta">{-# OPTIONS_GHC -XScopedTypeVariables #-}</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span></span> System.IO parseFile :: (<span class="hljs-type"><span class="hljs-type">Read</span></span> <span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-title">a</span></span>) =&gt; String -&gt; IO a parseFile fileName = do file &lt;- openFile fileName ReadMode content &lt;- hGetContents file rezult &lt;- return $ read content hClose file return rezult main = do a :: Int &lt;- parseFile "1.txt" print a <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">--: </span></span></code> </pre>  It seems to be an elementary example, but it DOES NOT WORK.  For the same reason.  The fact that we transferred the contents of the file to some <i>read</i> function did not change anything, because it was also deposited ‚Äúfor later‚Äù.  And no matter what we do with <i>content</i> , this will not force Haskell to read the contents from the file (unless we, of course, display it on the screen). <br>  You can, of course, place the whole program between <i>openFile</i> and <i>hClose</i> , but what if you need to read the contents of the file, correct it and write to the same file? <br><br>  I thought about this example for a long time and the feeling that ‚Äúsomething is wrong here‚Äù did not leave me alone.  Doesn‚Äôt this violate the purity of Haskell.  I wrote a program that is correct in essence, but it gives an incorrect result.  What should I think about at what point he will turn to this variable and what is he doing there at all under the hood?  This is not Haskell, this is, sorry for the expression, some C ++. <br>  As a result, I came to the conclusion that this "feature" is not a feature, but a bug.  If I did not convince you, here are a few reasons: <br><ul><li>  1. In lambda calculus, there are various strategies for reducing the lambda term: <i>full beta reduction</i> , <i>normal order of calculations</i> , <i>call by name</i> (haskell uses the optimized option <i>call by need</i> ), <i>call by value</i> (energetic calculations).  There is a theorem that states that any lambda term, regardless of the computation strategy, is reduced to the same normal form, if it exists at all.  Those.  for any order of computation (lazy or energetic) the same result should be obtained.  True, there are examples of lambda-terms, the calculation of which is looping with an energetic strategy, but not looping if it is lazy (for example, working with infinite lists).  But if both calculations are completed, they should give the same result! <br>  (By the way, the opposite example, when the lazy option is fixated, but energetic - no, does not exist. In this sense, the lazy strategy is the most ‚Äúneat‚Äù) <br>  If we look at our last example and imagine that Haskell is calculating it vigorously, then our program should work correctly and output the contents of the file.  Those.  in an energetic mode, one result, and in a lazy one - another.  You can argue that a program is not a lambda term and is not a pure function.  In a sense, this is true.  But let's remember why the monads were invented.  Is it not in order to present the program as some pure function that takes the state of the outside world at the input and gives out a new state to the output? <br></li><li>  2. Still, why does this happen?  In Haskell, all functions are clean.  The result of the calculation depends only on the arguments passed.  This means that we can postpone the calculation ‚Äúfor later‚Äù, and the result will not change.  In the case when we call <i>hGetContents</i> , the result of the function depends not only on the argument, but also on the state of the system at the moment.  Do we have the right to postpone ‚Äúfor later‚Äù a calculation that depends on the state of the system?  Ideally, the program should work like this: open the file, close the file, call <i>print to</i> return to the past (when the file was still open), read its contents, return to the future, display it on the screen. <br></li></ul>

      Why am I doing all this?  You just do not get me wrong.  I love Haskell very much.  For its purity, laziness, functionality and much more, which is not expressed in words.  I just suddenly found out that he was not as ‚Äúclean‚Äù as I had previously thought.  There remains some kind of mixed feeling that it seems to be a good feature, but somehow it became ‚Äúgryazny‚Äù from it. <br>  Maybe I just have paranoia.  I would like to hear your opinion, bug or feature? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153659/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153659/</a></p>
