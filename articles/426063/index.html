HPE continues to develop MSA arrays so that you get more speed, data availability and mobility.  I suggest taking a closer look at the innovations that will allow you to get much more from MSA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-m/lh/ka/-mlhkaibb4scyqzpde5b-qaqdvs.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>A proven entry level array with a true business class ecosystem and new features.</b>

      It's no secret that the HPE MSA storage system is not a new player in the market.  For nearly two decades, we have been improving and improving this product line.  Last year, a new generation of MSA 1050, 2050 and 2052 was introduced with doubled performance at the same price as the previous generation.  Today, with more than half a million units deployed, HPE MSA is the industry-leading FC SAN Array. <br><br>  <b>So what's new in MSA?</b> <br><br>  HPE Storage File Controller offers best-in-class services for block and file access to data.  Take any HPE MSA 1050, 2050, or 2052 device and add the HPE Storage File Controller to create a single, effective file and block storage solution for working with structured and unstructured data.  Thanks to advanced data services and flexible configurations, you can now optimize your SAN investment with HPE Storage File Controller by utilizing the unused capacity of your MSA array for shared Windows files.  HPE Storage File Controller can be deployed in traditional or cluster configurations for high data availability.  The HPE Storage File Controller perfectly complements file environments based primarily on Microsoft, especially in cases where file servers are outdated. <br><br>  <b>HPE and Zerto: hypervisor-based replication</b> <br><br>  HPE, together with the cloud solution provider Zerto, has joined forces to provide you with an unrivaled service that provides an almost synchronous, continuous availability solution that has mobility environments and the flexibility of multi-cloud technologies. <br><br>  As part of data availability, we are talking about replicating MSA or other arrays to MSA to create a disaster-tolerant solution ‚Äî with very low RTO and RPO.  This gives you the opportunity to use a cheaper array as a corporate repository used for disaster recovery, which, in turn, reduces overall costs.  You can use HPE MSA and Zerto solutions to increase the productivity and mobility of the application work environment between two HPE MSA arrays and / or other HPE storage systems.  Applications and workloads running on MSA can also be replicated to your primary data center or replicated to the cloud without risk.  For more information on this solution, download HPE MSA and Zerto Hybrid Cloud-based Replication Technical Documentation. <br><br>  <b>MSA 1050 Platform: Performance Boot with New Firmware Update to Version v270</b> <br><br>  Thanks to the new update, the youngest model 1050 gets more than 30% performance gains on a random write and read operation.  This is great news if you use SSD on your system.  The new update is already available for both new and existing systems MSA 1050. <br><br>  <b>Simplify interaction with hybrid and flash arrays.</b> <br><br>  We included the IOPS schedule in the MSA Management Console, giving users a visual idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe impact that the storage level on the SSD has on input-output processes for applications hosted in an array.  Because different applications create hot spots in the array at different times, MSA‚Äôs automatic performance enhancement engine transfers the hottest blocks or data to the fastest carrier levels (usually SSD) in real time.  The new IOPS graph provides users with an insight into this dynamic, which makes this tool very useful when you are working to maximize the benefits of investing in flash media. <br><br>  <b>LDAP Support: Simplify User Authentication</b> <br><br>  We have enabled LDAP support in MSA 1050/2050/2052 models with the release of V270 firmware.  Once user groups are configured on all MSA in your organization, users can be authenticated to any MSA through Active Directory.  This allows you to centralize authentication rules and simplify access for users who have multiple accounts for multiple MSA systems. <br><br>  <b>Encrypted Drives: Deploying SSD / HDD Hybrid Solutions</b> <br><br>  MSA 2050 now supports encryption with self-encrypting spindle drives and local key management capabilities within the array.  Not so long ago, support was added for two 800GB and 1.6TB solid-state drives.  Accordingly, when you need to implement a solution that requires encryption, you can easily build it on HPE MSA. <br><br>  <b>A brief example of how the introduction of HPE MSA with new features allowed to solve the problem of the client.</b> <br><br>  In any industry, it is critical to have efficient and reliable data storage ‚Äî especially with the increasing popularity of virtualization, which requires centralized shared storage. <br><br>  One of our clients, Longview Public School in Washington State, demonstrates how the HPE MSA flash memory meets the ever-present need for reliability, capacity and performance.  A couple of years ago, they bought one HPE MSA SAN Storage array with a total capacity of 28.8 TB to support their three-host Hyper-V cluster.  Dan Jones, a technology specialist at Longview Public Schools, told the story of MSA deployment: <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe value HPE for its reliability.  We had a debate on whether to choose MSA or install HPE 3PAR StoreServ Storage right away.  As a result, we realized that for our needs, the MSA system turned out to be the right solution with the right capacity and at the right price. ‚Äù <br><br>  Jones notes that an array with standard spindle disks was first installed.  Later, when it was decided to add a second shelf to fit the number of disks larger than 24, in order to start virtualization of the Microsoft Exchange server, it was decided to choose a more efficient solution. <br><br>  Were purchased 4 SSD drives with a capacity of 1.6 TB and software to automatically increase performance in order to correctly allocate workloads depending on portebnosti.  Thin provisioning on MSA (Thin Provisioning) allocates physical resources only as the application consumes to increase the efficiency of the used disk space, while SSD cache improves performance when randomly reading, allowing you to use SSD as an extension of the MSA controller cache. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/426063/">https://habr.com/ru/post/426063/</a></p>
