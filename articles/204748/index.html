      Under the cat you will find a story about our unique labeling products <b>with a full technical analysis of</b> specifications, as well as an overview of the areas and methods of application! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Why do we need marking of underground communications?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Cities are connected by a network of underground utilities necessary for their livelihoods and hidden from prying eyes by dozens of meters of asphalt, concrete and soil.  This is a huge "city under the city", consisting of branched gas lines, heat and communication networks, cable collectors, technological tunnels and mines, sewage networks and wastewater, and much more.  It is no secret that today the state of these communications leaves much to be desired, and they periodically fail and require serious repair ... and they can only be reached by digging up a street or a roadway ... <br><br>  Moreover, the larger and older the city, the higher the density and complexity of various networks and the risk of accidental damage during construction and repair work.  And this is fraught with serious consequences - the de-energization of entire areas (in case of damage to power cables) and fires (in the event of damage to gas pipelines). <br><br>  How to prevent these effects using electromagnetic induction and RFID technology? </div></div><br><br>  We have significantly modified many solutions, significantly increasing the accuracy of the location and visibility of the displayed data, and tell you how we did it. <br><br><h4>  What are the problems with standard tracing methods? </h4><br><ul><li>  Cartographic method: executive drawings are often inaccurate, outdated, or compiled with large errors;  specific points of the engineering network (couplings, turns, changes in depth) are difficult to determine accurately on the ground. </li><li>  External identification marks: short-lived, damaged by vandals. </li><li>  Conventional GPS-navigators: low accuracy in dense urban areas;  data is entered manually and stored separately, unsystematically. </li></ul><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Offtop: looking for a network without point marking.</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">Familiar?</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d8/88e/b88/0d888eb88d3f3f7dae3119244aa91512.jpg"><br>  <i>Source - google.com</i> </div></div><br><br><h4>  The essence of our electronic labeling technology </h4><br>  The technology of electronic marking consists in probing the surface with a special device that generates signals in order to determine the location of a marker embedded in the ground next to the engineering network during its construction / during repair and restoration work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/29c/33e/af8/29c33eaf8340da063aa65aa79741677c.jpg"><br>  <i>The Scotchmark marker</i> is a resonating oscillating circuit placed in a protective plastic casing.

Due to this, a high accuracy of measurements of the device is achieved, as well as the ability to work in the Directional Peak mode, which allows the operator to determine by visual indication on the display of the device (signal level in dB + directional arrows) which side and how far from communication it is at the moment .).  A total of 4 search modes are available: a directed peak, a zero directed, a special peak and an inductive peak, as well as a visualization mode on the display of a metal communication route. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e47/87f/0fd/e4787f0fda5a5f39b487271cba72d4c7.jpg"><br>  <i>The buttons at the device are responsive, and most importantly - the dirt and water does not fall under them!</i> <br><br>  Dynatel locators have the following functionality: <br><ol><li>  Cable / pipe path determination </li><li>  Determining the depth of the cable / pipe or inductive probe type, launched into the pipe for diagnostics and tracing </li><li>  Detection, reading and programming of electronic markers </li><li>  Measurement of signal current in a cable or pipe </li><li>  Identification of cable or cable pairs </li><li>  Damage search function (using A-frame) </li><li>  A complete set of accessories (damage search frames, solenoids of various sizes, all necessary types of cables, various types of recharging devices) </li></ol><br><br>  Our tracing equipment has one of the widest sets of active frequencies (577 Hz, 8 kHz, 33 kHz, 133 kHz + 1 kHz and 82 kHz for the newest Dynatel 2500 series) + 4 user-adjustable frequencies from 0 to 999 Hz and the widest range of frequencies for searching in passive mode (50/100 Hz + 5th and 9th harmonics, cable TV frequency 31.5 kHz, radio frequency 15-30 kHz). <br><br>  This allows accurate and reliable localization of underground utilities in the most difficult conditions of the so-called ‚Äúdirty air‚Äù by selecting the most optimal route search frequency (in particular, in the city, when many metal utilities and various routes pass through the vicinity, power cables, pipes for heat, water and gas supply). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3b3/ec5/0d6/3b3ec50d684228471ebc95d43a6d3068.jpg"><br><br>  Generators that come with modern equipment Dynatel 2200M and 2500 series, allow continuous tracing of the pipeline to a distance of up to several tens of km (for the situation of direct galvanic connection of the generator to the terminal board of the instrumentation system of the cathodic protection or directly to the pipeline through service access points application of a 12 watt generator).  And also allow you to measure the depth of communication (no more than 9 m).  A number of Dynatel models (index 73) have the ability to search for damage to cables and wires of cathodic protection (contact of the metal core of the cable with the ground is necessary). <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Under cover</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d42/206/b92/d42206b92f7f691484a36a73fec43ef1.jpg"></div></div><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d7a/1e7/9fe/d7a1e79fec82fc41007989d8483e2296.jpg"><br><br>  For use on polyethylene pipelines and fiber-optic communication lines, route finders are most optimal with the ability to search for electronic markers and read / write data in intelligent electronic markers (track marker detectors) or simple marker detectors. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">View entirely:</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b91/ffb/fe5/b91ffbfe51dff96cffff1941060d20ba.jpg"></div></div><br><br><h4>  Technical characteristics of our Dynatel locators: </h4><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Dynatel base locators 2200-E</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b61/15f/dd2/b6115fdd291a09d52fbcb3137a47ad81.jpg"></div></div><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Dynatel tracer finder 2200M standard series</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/561/b78/935/561b78935139009275947911bd14cea7.jpg"></div></div><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Complete generator Dynatel 2273M</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/26f/fcb/f80/26ffcbf80428cf76dca3d90113206b21.jpg"></div></div><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Dynatel Premium Series 2500E Locators</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a39/3f3/710/a393f3710f895fe1d728dba3b72a086f.jpg"></div></div><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Marker Dynatel 1420E-iD</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cf5/e15/df9/cf5e15df9563ed30fa0341758e605813.jpg"></div></div><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Marker-lentoyskatel Dynatel 7420</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b1d/7cd/bbb/b1d7cdbbbc9e70839af0af79c9c3fdc4.jpg"></div></div><br><br><h4>  Comparison of equipment characteristics </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fb4/d92/74e/fb4d9274e7e49a2934f2474d122a1776.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Dynatel's technology for tracing and damage: </h4><br><br>  <b>Search cable / pipe route by direct connection</b> <br><br>  One generator terminal is connected to the instrumentation / carpet terminals / directly to the cable / pipe (for example, to the gate valve), the other to ground at the near end (the grounding pin comes with the generator) <br><br>  The generator transmits a signal of a certain frequency, which passes through the metallic conductor of a cable or pipe and, due to grounding, returns back, forming a closed electrical circuit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ce/d15/f74/6ced15f7463834dd419cde87f15d02ef.jpg"><br><br>  A receiver tuned to the same frequency picks up the signal and displays its level (as well as the approximate path trajectory for the Dynatel 2500E series trackers). <br><br>  <b>Grounding options at the far end with an active tracker:</b> <br><br>  Grounding can be arranged on its own in the case of access to the cable / pipe (for example, through valves). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e6f/92c/9e2/e6f92c9e22cb7d799e0fb3674c9b7432.jpg"><br><br>  Track search is also possible if there is no ground at the far end.  In this case, the signal will diverge in communication in both directions, and the electrical circuit will be closed due to capacitive leakage to the ground.  The power of such a signal will be <br>  less. <br><br>  <b>Search trails using a solenoid and inductive method</b> <br><br>  Using a solenoid (induction clamp) Dyna-Coupler allows you to precisely strand the cable / pipe when it is impossible to directly connect to it.  However, the tracing distance will be less - about 1.5 km. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a90/294/e42/a90294e42215fc1cbd76bc773e16663a.jpg"><br>  The inductive method allows tracing without the need for access to communication / instrumentation.  The generator is installed on the ground above the intended point of passage of the route and directs a signal through the ground.  The disadvantage of this method is lower trace accuracy due to the susceptibility of the signal to interference <br><br>  <b>Search of a route by a passive method and search for damage of an ECP</b> <br><br>  The essence of the method consists in registering the acting signals in communication with the help of a receiver (without the use of a generator).  For example, for gas pipelines, this signal is an ECP (100 Hz) signal.  In general, Dynatel equipment allows passive path search by the following signals: <br><ul><li>  Industrial frequency 50 Hz + its harmonics, incl.  100 Hz ‚Ä¢ LF radio signals (10 - 30 kHz) </li><li>  Telecommunication signals (577 Hz, 512 Hz, 560 Hz) </li><li>  Cable TV Signal (31.5 kHz) </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e08/94a/1f9/e0894a1f91e8f05a5e73a75ff63eb509.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Cable insulation damage search</b> <br><br>  The exact localization of the damage site is carried out with the help of an A-frame, sequentially installed in the ground.  The device compares the signal from the A-frame with the reference (‚àÜ‚â§12 dB) and displays on the display indications in the form of arrows indicating the direction to the damage site. <br>  In the place of damage, the display will constantly change. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cfa/71b/31f/cfa71b31f106ef10ece196451d6d2acd.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Special operating modes: route visualization (for 2500 series models)</b> <br><br>  Benefits: <br><ul><li>  A graphical display of the pipeline / cable trajectory facilitates the work with the device and speeds up the search. </li><li>  Simplification of road search in places full of communications, while maintaining high accuracy. </li><li>  Activation mode with one keystroke. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/23f/659/848/23f65984809672d5fbf0961e3e961624.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Special modes of operation: simultaneous search for tracks and electronic markers</b> <br><br>  Dynatel trace marker devices simultaneously measure the signal from the track and from the electronic marker, and also make it possible to measure the depth of the track at a specific point, as well as the electronic marker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ef2/41e/186/ef241e1861aaa6d7c66a557eca79a694.jpg"><br><br><h4>  So where should this solution be applied? </h4><br>  The 3M tracing system is aimed, first of all, at improving the safety of operation of cable power lines for underground installation, i.e.  to reduce the risk of accidents and injuries, as well as minimize the consequences of accidents, which could not be avoided. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a14/074/ad8/a14074ad8c917600cf9c8010e3f6307b.jpg"><br>  <i>Objects of underground communications, recommended for labeling.</i> <br><br>  Thus, it is possible to distinguish the following functional benefits that this solution provides: <br><br>  1. Reducing the probability of damage to the cable line during excavation work due to the absolute identification of the cable route with the help of intelligent markers and marking tape. <br><br>  2. Reducing the time for tracing due to the high accuracy of the bindings using intelligent markers (especially relevant outside areas of dense urban development), the absence of interference from neighboring communications (especially important in busy urban areas) and obtaining additional information from the memory of intelligent markers.  An even greater reduction in time is achieved through integration with GPS / GLONASS 3M system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ce5/6aa/2b3/ce56aa2b39fdfca0df9288a5ec2db2d0.jpg"><br>  <i>Complex solution 3M AISU IPC: Megafon VOLS, integration with GIS.</i> <br><br><h4>  Features of our integrated e-labeling solution: </h4><br><ul><li>  Intelligent point marking of special places on the route of engineering networks; </li><li>  continuous marking of the route of cable lines with the help of a signal tape with electronic markers; </li><li>  binding of reference points of the route to geolocation coordinates with the possibility of mixing information from the memory of intelligent markers into a single corporate database (3M AISU IPC system). </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2d7/d8c/4e3/2d7d8c4e3e7a47df470a4c3f2aac7bc0.jpg"><br>  <i>Very convenient and intuitive control.</i> <br><br>  These technologies allow not only spot detection (as is the case with ‚Äúsimple‚Äù or passive markers), but also the absolute identification of non-metallic underground distribution networks.  The concept of "absolute identification" includes 4 main elements: <br><ul><li>  High-precision localization (¬± 10-20 cm), independent of industrial noise, soil properties, and so on. </li><li>  The possibility of obtaining reliable information about underground utilities and special places on it (turns, intersections with other communications, welding sites, service access points) without the need to drill through the function of reading / writing data into the memory of intelligent markers; </li><li>  Continuous tracing of a polyethylene pipe on straight sections, and also in turns using a signal tape with markers; </li><li>  Absolute binding of the points of the engineering network to the intelligent markers, with the possibility of additional binding to satellite coordinates. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  And how many markers do you need? </h4><br>  Calculation of the number of intelligent markers per 1 km of the KLEP. <br><br>  In general, the number of markers per 1 km is calculated by the formula: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ba/758/294/3ba75829421e15b48fa1d2d18ad932b7.jpg"><br><br>  <i>where L (constr_length) is the building cable length (usually 500 m),</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Q (chains) - the number of chains of the underground network,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Q (phases) - the number of phases</i> <i><br></i>  <i>L (between_mark) - the distance between adjacent markers on straight sections,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>k (spec_places) - coefficient reflecting the total number of labeling objects, taking into account the spec.</i>  <i>places (turns, intersections, changes in depth)</i> <br>  K (spec_places) is on average 1.5 <br>  L (between_mark) for high-class utility networks is 50 m, for the middle class - 100 m (recommended values) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a51/94c/dbe/a5194cdbe8cd654f829ddae0b24f41fe.jpg"><br><br><h4>  How cost effective to use? </h4><br><ul><li>  Reduction of time for conducting underground communications with the use of intelligent markers - 45% data of the VCS branch of JSC ‚ÄúMOESK‚Äù based on the normative calculation of the complexity of the route of the network of JSC ‚ÄúTSOTenergo‚Äù </li><li>  According to our own estimate, the probability of damage to the network due to the anthropogenic factor (31% of the total number of accidents on CL according to the data of NTC FGC UES) is reduced by 50% </li><li>  Losses of the electric grid company due to insufficient safety of the KLEP operation can be calculated by the formula: <br>  <b>Œ± * (Œ≤ * VC + FC)</b> <br>  <i>Œ± - probability of an accident</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Œ≤ - time of work</i> <i><br></i>  <i>VC - variable costs (lost profits due to disconnection of the network circuit + pay)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>FC - fixed costs incl.</i>  <i>cost of construction and installation works and materials, fines from supervisory authorities, and reputational risks</i> </li><li>  The economic effect of the introduction - reducing the fixed operating costs by 15.5% and variable costs by 53.5%. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Calculation of the number of intelligent markers per 1 km of the underground network.</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/256/03d/d6c/25603dd6cb3d4ab1ed97f01cd844b33a.jpg"><br><br>  <b>The cost of construction of 1 km KL, mln rub.</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a1f/6b0/e7b/a1f6b0e7b568a19698f18cc780d078e0.jpg"><br>  <i>According to the aggregate indicators of the cost of construction of cable power lines of FGC UES standard STO 56947007-29.240.014-2008, converted to current prices by the PPI coefficient in construction 2000-2012 (~ 4.2)</i> <br><br>  <b>The share of the cost of the use of smart markers in the total cost of building KLEP.</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/684/925/41a/68492541ac354eea94f7103d5a32c5e3.jpg"><br><br><h5>  How does all this work in a complex? </h5><br>  All components of this solution work interconnectedly: the PDA connects directly to the track detector or marker, and when the device reads data from smart markers, it can map the GPS / GLONASS coordinates and automatically put these points on the electronic map.  At the same time, the intelligent markers ‚Äúhard‚Äù bind to the marked object or point of the route, ensuring absolute identification and localization with very high accuracy.  Upon returning to the office, the employee uploads the recorded data from the PDA to the corporate information system (for example, the geographic information system ‚Äî GIS or the electronic passport database), which allows one-time access to any number of competent employees. <br><br>  Any employee, receiving a task and going to an object, has the opportunity to upload information from a single electronic information database on the route to the PDA, and upon completion of work - download a report to the server and update the information in the database in accordance with the results of the work done. <br>  Nevertheless, it is important to note that, as a rule, the currently existing corporate GIS are loosely connected or not at all related to the results of work obtained ‚Äúin the field‚Äù using (trace) marker search equipment.  The entry of data about the route and its objects (the depth of the route, data about the marking objects) in the GIS is done manually.  In this sense, such GIS cannot be called fully automated, since  data transfer to GIS is carried out manually.  Manual input is performed subjectively and with large amounts of recorded data takes a lot of time and is fraught with errors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c1e/78d/da8/c1e78dda8375880c16e6b2a01ce8671d.jpg"><br>  <i>Our Russian colleagues are on trial.</i> <br><br>  It is possible to dock the Automated Intelligent Accounting System for marked underground communications with GIS organizations operating in one of the standard formats (csv, shp, kml, xml, ecw, sid).  Practical solution of the problem of docking with the company's existing GIS will allow creating a single fully functional accounting system for the organization‚Äôs gas distribution networks. <br>  If there is no operating GIS in the company, the implementation of 3M AISU MPK allows you to get a ready-made "boxed" version of the gas distribution grid system on a turnkey basis, working with the above described functionality. <br><br><h4>  Additionally: </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a58/d52/800/a58d528001c87da779401d938da2ae13.jpg"><br>  <i>Our field specialist, <b>Gregory Tuzov,</b> in field conditions, shows for the technical specialists of the companies Megafon OJSC and MTS OJSC the work of the tracker with markers and GPS equipment within the 3M AISU IPC system.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>You can ask any technical questions in the comments, <b>he, with pleasure, will answer all!</b></i> <br><br><h5>  Where else can you find out information? </h5><br>  On our <a href="http://solutions.3mrussia.ru/wps/portal/3M/ru_RU/EU-ElectronicsElectrical/Home/ProdInfo/PipelineCableLocators/">old site of Locate &amp; Marking</a> , and the next article will be a new, modern! <br><br><h4>  Where can I buy? </h4><br>  Our <a href="http://www.3mpartners.ru/ru_RU/%25D0%259E%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D1%258A%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2584%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D1%258B/offline.html">distributors</a> in the largest cities of Russia <br><br><h4>  Do you have anything else to read? </h4><br>  Of course! <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/3mrussia/blog/200840/">Novec 1230 dry water to protect server and not only</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/3mrussia/blog/203828/">How to safely read Habr at work using our information security screens</a> <br><br>  <i>If we made any mistakes, write to the LAN, we will fix everything promptly.</i>  <i>Do not forget, we will correct the error, and your post will remain hanging.</i> <br><br>  Thank you for your attention, we hope this article has been helpful to you! <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">legal information</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  3M and Dynatel are registered trademarks. </div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/204748/">https://habr.com/ru/post/204748/</a></p>
