  <section class="page js-page"><h1>One and a half years of life under the sign of IT. As manager manager</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Three years of working in a telecommunications company as an analyst brought me closer to a computer than ever.  Co strict "you" we switched to "you."  Every day it was necessary to expand the tools with the help of which it was necessary to create more and more sophisticated and subtle analytical reports.  A mobile operator is a company whose basis is subscribers and their calls, and, therefore, money.  Analytical studies demanded an increasingly serious campaign, ready-made reports and samples prepared by the IT-service, no longer satisfy the interests and cover requests.  The beginning of VBA, SPSS, MS Access came to the rescue with uncomplicated independently mastered SQL queries.  By the end of the third year of work, communication with IT completely ceased to frighten, on the contrary, it began to attract - they spoke and did clearly and accurately, without splitting the lyrics, magic actions were performed on their monitors, which became clearer and closer in the process of communication. <br><br>  For the first time in four years since graduation, I wanted to study. <a name="habracut"></a>  The choice fell on paid annual courses of the integrated software development program at the Institute of Information Technology, created and thriving under the wing of a very large local IT company.  Friends, acquaintances, colleagues twisted their fingers at the temple, seeing my preparation for learning - for admission it was necessary to pass an English test at least at the level of everyday conversation.  My French didn‚Äôt fit into this condition and had to sit down at the training manual on the beginnings of communication, opened in the open spaces of the network.  For the exam, colleagues saw off all the world ‚Äî no one had illusions and everyone secretly hoped that I would think again and not hang a yearly yoke on my neck. <br><br>  However, English was successfully handed over with only one mistake, an application for postponing work time was written and studies started 3-5 times a week from 18 to 21. The first subject was C language. I must say that some students refused to study immediately after the first lecture .  I will not deny that, among people with programming skills who have come to pump their skills, several newcomers from scratch feel extremely uncomfortable.  A woman teacher, an excellent person, a programmer and an educator, worked wonders: she talked about C, showed wonderful presentations, and right there in Visual Studio threw on charming lists of numbers and the ASCII code conversion program.  After the first lecture, Visual Studio was soon installed on the laptop at home and, with trembling hands, wrote the first ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù. <br>  I will never forget these mystical lines of code:

The work did not leave much time for classes and successes were modest, but the desire did not go anywhere and all the New Year holidays from January 1 to 10 were spent on solving problems and reading books on the C language, which was successfully commissioned in mid-January.  But, as it turned out, it was obviously too early to feel like a god. <br><br>  The architecture of PCs and networks, the Assembler, the basics of design were deeper and deeper, revealing new knowledge and plunging into a world unlike the world of economist and analyst.  And then Unix began ... Frightening and incomprehensible during the first two lessons, he became a true friend and helper for almost the whole year: a pseudo-terminal, a command line, a little Bash became familiar and familiar interfaces.  Now the computer has ceased to be a machine - it has become a friend.  At that moment, it was still impossible to know how tightly I would make friends with the command line.  Then there was Java (alas, they gave it rather weakly for objective, however reasons), UML and patterns, English, C ++, Python and Shell.  Then it was time for sharing in the library of Straustrup and Shildt, subsequently thoroughly greasy.  If C ++ scared, pushed and forced to wake up at night, then the tasks in Python and Shell caused an extraordinary pleasure and dragged them to solve. <br><br>  By the time of comprehension of Python and C ++, I had to leave the job of an analyst - the world has changed, the company has changed.  The search for work, kind people and a case led me to the very organization where my training center was, for the position of testing engineer.  It was then that it became clear why there was a study of the previous 7 months.  Neither the black-and-white terminal, nor the virtual machines, nor the Python scripts, nor vim, nor the OSI protocol stack frightened me ‚Äî the work was difficult, but very understandable.  Half a year behind the keyboard, the testers flew like one day, the skills were pumped, and the training came to an end.  The diploma was written hard, under Unix and C ++ - with the help of a friend programmer, Habr, books and hundreds of programmer forums.  The program for sending SMS from a USB modem was created and successfully protected in English.  A proud certificate now decorates my apartment. <br><br>  The end of the story is sad.  Leaving the position of engineer for several reasons, not related to the work itself, I managed to find a new, interesting and very attractive job for me in advertising, marketing and commerce, but again in an IT company producing interesting products. <br><br>  Of course, it is impossible to become a programmer in a year, especially when this profession is not to your liking.  But 2011-2012 was the moment for me when it came to understanding important things.  Here, on Habr√©, there are a lot of managers, businessmen and other "non-technical" specialists close to the IT field.  And I want to tell them about the findings: <br><ul><li>  Do not be afraid to learn.  Never.  And never too late.  Any kind of training, especially with elements of self-study, is a colossal growth, moral and intellectual, and for someone, also career. </li><li>  No need to look at IT specialists / system administrators / programmers as crazy geeks.  These people create what you sell or what you manage, they ensure the performance of networks and devices, develop ideas and push progress.  It is they. </li><li>  For the year you can not become a programmer, but you can learn to think differently.  The software / hardware you work with will no longer be frighteningly magical things for you in a primitive way and you will no longer feel that ‚Äúglitches‚Äù and ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù arise because the program lives by itself. </li><li>  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãand manage easier when you know the item.  When you look at software / hardware from the point of view of an IT specialist, you yourself are surprised to find such competitive advantages that will make you gray, sorry for taftology, your competitors.  You just understand what you are working with.  This is cool, believe me. </li><li>  Do not think that you will learn everything online.  Yes, there are such nuggets, but you should not be arrogant - live communication with the teacher, ready to endlessly approach you and edit your curve code with your own hands, do not replace with anything.  This is an experience. </li><li>  Sooner or later, you will still write a tiny script that facilitates your work.  Or maybe create something new and open your business? </li><li>  Learn English if you haven't done it yet. </li></ul><br><br>  Allow your life to change in something and it will respond to you with pleasant surprises and prospects.  Do not regret time and money, do not regret yourself - time will pass and you will see that it was not wasted.  But otherwise - fatal exception error. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/168017/">https://habr.com/ru/post/168017/</a></p>
