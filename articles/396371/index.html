  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Selection of the "most" wireless headphones: from Dash to Moto</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The trend to create fully wireless headphones appeared after the loud success of Dash headphones, which two years later begin to ship massively around the world, including to Russia.  Nevertheless, many have already succeeded in creating headphones without wires, and the loudest samples are in our selection. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb0/a6e/706/eb0a6e7069bb45ba99d62dcfd7ec2e4f.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Bragi dash</b> <br><br>  The headphones not only turned out to be ‚ÄúWow‚Äù in 2014, but also pushed others, including major manufacturers, to the idea that the headphones can be completely wireless.  The Kickstarter campaign ended in triumph.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/039/3df/eac/0393dfeac9dd4086b23da89ba01457ff.png"><br><br>  Dash - tracker headphones, which can be used during workouts, even swimming, as they are waterproof, which was lacking in many other sports headsets.  They work as a player and paired with a smartphone, analyze the pulse, fix the distance (here is <a href="https://www.groovc.com/posts/bragi-dash-review">a good overview</a> from a person who systematically runs). <br><br>  The battery life is enough for training: from 2 to 3 hours depending on the mode of use.  Built-in memory is enough for up to 1,000 songs.  It is important that for security there is an opportunity to hear the surrounding noises, an external microphone captures sounds and amplifies them, feeding in parallel with the music or ‚Äúinterfering‚Äù in a telephone conversation. <br><br>  The device is available in two colors: black and white. <br><br>  In Russia, they <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/the-dash-besprovodnye-umnye-naushniki.html%3Futm_source%3Dgkt%26utm_medium%3Dbragi%26utm_campaign%3Ddash">will be in August</a> , their cost is about 23,000 rubles. <br><br>  <b>Samsung IconX</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/57b/1ee/3b7/57b1ee3b74b54ac3a2d0530032b71ff3.jpg"><br><br>  In fact - <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/278460/">permeable analogue of Dash</a> .  Quickly dropping fast, Samsung launched sales in Russia, and the ‚Äúears‚Äù are <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/samsung-gear-iconx.html%3Futm_source%3Dgkt%26utm_medium%3Dbragi%26utm_campaign%3DiconX">twice as cheap as the</a> ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù.  They sync directly with any smartphone or work in the SHealth system with Android only.  Calculate the distance and note the pulse, have the ability to capture external sounds and sound continuously from 1, 5 to 3 hours.  Perhaps the only difference from the previous instance is the inability to use them in the pool. <br><br>  <b>Earin</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/356/fd0/2f9/356fd02f99a640ad99e453da8ffb3cae.jpg"><br><br>  This is not a tracker headphones, but their main competitive offer - size.  Earin's very small and light, almost imperceptible in their ears, also work without wires, without even having headset functions.  The case in which they are delivered is able to charge them twice, after which they will continuously work up to 3 hours in the ‚Äústereo‚Äù mode, and up to 11 in the ‚Äúmono‚Äù mode. <a href="https://www.earin.com/">The cost of the device is $ 249</a> .  Synchronization with devices that support Bluetooth from 3.0. <br><br>  <b>Nextear</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a6b/f9a/51a/a6bf9a51aae54d9dbf7ad2592e812b1a.jpg"><br><br>  Another sports headphones without tracker functions, which are already 85% ready to be sent.  Pre-orders can be left on the official website, and, if you believe the advertisement, every 10 signers will receive their kit for free! <br><br>  The model competes in size and weight with Earin: each earphone weighs 2, 5 grams, and the case of the device acts not only as a "trust bank".  At the expense of the box, the memory of the device can be expanded up to 200 GB, in which case it will act as a player or volume flash drive.  True, such a case is available in the <a href="http://nextear.net.au/product/nextear-unit/">expensive version</a> , in <a href="http://nextear.net.au/product/nextear-lt/">a cheaper one</a> - the case acts as an ordinary docking station.  Playing time is up to 70 hours! <br><br>  <b>Truebuds</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/234/36b/d86/23436bd86827426b9ba07caf759fdf12.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pearbuds/pearbuds-the-worlds-smallest-stereo-cordless-earbu/description">The project with Kickstarter</a> : ordinary headphones without wires, which promise active noise cancellation, 18 hours of work and 6 hours of continuous music playback.  Pre-order cost $ 99, the retail price should be $ 100 higher. <br><br>  <b>Here</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/81f/30b/057/81f30b057826492489ce252e21ef5873.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://hereplus.me/">Another copy</a> with its box-charging and some unique features, which is still at the development stage: the shipment may begin at the end of the year.  The built-in microphone allows you to communicate or control using voice commands of your smartphone, and the noise cancellation system should be able to distinguish sounds in order to ‚Äúcrush‚Äù the hum of a motor or office conversations.  Sports opportunities do not have. <br><br>  <b>Onkyo</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/741/817/674/7418176742fe433ca03b716d25fde7ae.jpg"><br><br>  The Onkyo brand has its own model of a wireless headset.  No overspecifications have been found: 3 hours of music will continuously lose, an additional charge will be made from the case, which will give another 15 hours of playback.  All features on the <a href="http://www.onkyo-headphones.com/en/headphones/in-ear/w800bt.html">official site</a> . <br><br>  <b>Moto</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/403/d19/d6a/403d19d6a431476884fbf2d375ff30c1.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-VerveOnes-Completely-Wireless-Earbuds/dp/B01F5FYXO8">For $ 249,</a> you can get fully wireless and waterproof headphones from Moto, which declare 12 hours of playback.  There are two built-in microphones, the ability to control the smartphone using voice commands, and also, what is important for models of this kind is the ability to see the last synchronization location on the map. <br><br>  <b>Syllable D900</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c55/64f/a1b/c5564fa1ba7c4441ba18ed885f98247f.jpg"><br><br>  Once we mentioned Amazon, we‚Äôll also write about Aliexpress: up to 6000, you can buy <a href="http://ru.aliexpress.com/item/Syllable-D900-headphone-Wireless-Bluetooth-4-0-earphones-sports-headset-with-charging-stand-for-android-ios/32473267686.html">headphones</a> from the Chinese manufacturer Syllable: they inherit the external features of this type of headset, they have their own case bank and are controlled by sensors. <br><br>  <b>Gogo</b> <br><br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/267550/">Another Chinese equivalent of Dash</a> , which arose almost in parallel with the latest advertising campaign.  Fitness functions, distance tracking and the heart rate monitor were also announced, but in fact everything is not working very well, and by now (past since the review) one earphone has completely "died". <br><br>  <b>Elbee</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6b3/a8e/eca/6b3a8eeca04d459888827ba88a59adc9.jpg"><br><br>  Died and Elbee.  Now <a href="http://www.getelbee.com/">the official site of the</a> wireless headset thanks and goodbyes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396371/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396371/</a></p>
