  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Windows XP in Windows 7 or a few questions about XP Mode</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Microsoft said on Thursday that the final version of the Windows XP virtual environment will be available on October 22, the day Windows 7 is published. Known as XP Mode (hereinafter referred to as ‚ÄúXP Mode‚Äù), this new Microsoft virtualization software makes it easy to migrate to Windows 7 for businesses and users who can migrate all of their Windows XP programs.  On Habre, XP Mode has already been considered in a number of articles; however, after reviewing them, I tried to summarize some of the questions and, in general, supplement the above with the latest available information. <br><br><img src="http://lovesoft.ru/uploads/posts/2009-05/1241710701_7534.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Last year, active discussions of enterprise-oriented virtualization solutions from Microsoft began, such as Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack (MDOP), App-V (Application Virtualization) and MED-V (Microsoft Enterprise Desktop Virtualization).  It is the latter that are the basis for Microsoft‚Äôs attempt to kill two birds with one stone - to satisfy users and administrators simultaneously.  After all, one of the important obstacles to the rejection of the ‚Äúaging‚Äù XP is the unwillingness of users and administrators to stop using their old favorite, tested and studied programs. <br><br><h4>  What is "XP Mode"? </h4><br>  ‚ÄúXP Mode‚Äù launches Windows XP with 3rd service pack as a virtual environment in Windows 7, which allows you to work with your XP-oriented programs on a machine with the main axis - Windows 7. Between similar ones for an inexperienced Internet reader, XP Mode "And MED-V Lite there are significant differences (see note F).  ‚ÄúXP Mode‚Äù is more loyal in terms of performance and does not require any special licensing agreement available only to large companies.

      It should be noted, Deb Shinder notes, that despite the literal translation of the name ‚ÄúXP Mode‚Äù is not some special ‚Äúmode‚Äù in which you can run Windows 7, and this is not something built into your main operating system.  This is a completely separate application - Windows Virtual PC, which runs a special virtual machine.  The main difference from third-party virtual machines is that in this case Windows XP is already created, installed and licensed in it. <br><br><h4>  Why is "XP Mode" shipped separately from Windows 7? </h4><br>  As far as I know, the main reason is a trick taken by Microsoft to avoid conflicts with antitrust laws. <br><br><h4>  What is Windows Virtual PC? </h4><br>  Windows Virtual PC is the main software engine that makes virtualization like XP Mode possible.  Virtual PC is strictly required to run XP Mode.  Integrating XP Mode in Windows Virtual PC displays your favorite applications running in virtual Windows XP on the Windows 7 desktop as if they were installed and running on the main Windows 7 machine. In other words, you won't even need to see Your XP virtual desktop (only if you just want to ‚Äúlook‚Äù at it). <br><br>  In general, this is all very similar to Terminal Services in Windows Server 2008, where the user instead of a single remote desktop sees separate windows running on the server applications.  The difference in our case is only that such a server is a virtual OS in which ‚Äúterminal‚Äù applications are installed, and a ‚Äúterminal client‚Äù is running on the parent OS, whose tasks also include, if necessary, ‚Äúraising‚Äù a virtual OS on demand, if not working yet <br><br>  It is worth noting that Windows Virtual PC is not limited to installing and running a virtual machine only in "XP Mode".  You can also install other guest operating systems (for example, Vista, Windows 7, etc.) and run corresponding applications under them. <br><br><h4>  What about security? </h4><br>  It is important to know that despite various rumors and private opinions, this question is quite simple - using ‚ÄúXP mode‚Äù you actually use a completely separate logical computer that does not inherit the security settings of your main Windows 7 machine, its software, or its updates that are responsible for security, etc. In other words, you need to double monitor your computer - separately for Windows 7, and completely separately - for your guest system, with all the ensuing consequences. <br><br>  It is also important to remember that using ‚ÄúXP Mode‚Äù - you use a full-fledged separate machine that should be managed like a regular non-virtual machine with Windows XP installed on it. <br><br>  To ensure safety, do the following: <br><ol><li>  Make sure that the appropriate antivirus software is installed on the XP on the VM.  Local software on the host machine does not protect XP. </li><li>  Make sure that all necessary updates are received on the VM via automatic update or WSUS. </li><li>  Make sure that all applications installed on the VM receive updates from the manufacturer if necessary. </li><li>  Disable unnecessary services on the XP operating system running on the VM. </li></ol><br>  In other words, you need to follow the safety instructions from the Windows XP Security Compliance Management Toolkit, <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc163061.aspx">here</a> . <br><br><h4>  For whom is XP Mode intended? </h4><br>  Microsoft decided to implement ‚ÄúXP Mode‚Äù in order to convince conservative small enterprises and mid-level companies to abandon Windows XP in favor of Windows 7. Some firms continue to use Windows XP, as they use their usual software that may conflict with the latest Windows versions are not compatible with it at all.  Concern about the emergence of conflicts with the old software - is one of the most important reasons, due to which a number of companies decided not to migrate to Windows Vista.  Offering "XP Mode", Microsoft hopes to finally put an end to Windows XP and lure the client base from this "aging OS." <br><br><h4>  What do I need to run XP Mode? </h4><br>  You can run Windows Virtual PC on any version of Windows 7, but XP Mode only works on versions: Windows 7 Enterprise, Professional, and Ultimate. <br><br>  You also need to make sure your processor supports virtualization.  PC World magazine has an incomplete list of processors that do not support ‚ÄúXP mode‚Äù virtualization, and Microsoft has utilities for Intel and AMD processors that can determine if your computer‚Äôs configuration is ‚ÄúXP mode‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  Where can I get "XP Mode" and how much does it cost? </h4><br>  You can download Release Candidates - ‚ÄúXP Mode‚Äù and Windows Virtual PC right now from the official Microsoft website.  Full versions will be available for download only from October 22.  XP Mode and Virtual PC are available for free download. <br><br><h4>  Notes: </h4><br>  A / XP Mode is nothing more than a ‚Äútwirled‚Äù copy of Windows XP SP3. <br><br>  B / IMPORTANT: Upgrading from Windows XP Mode Beta to Candidate Version Windows XP Mode is not supported.  Uninstall Windows XP Mode Beta and Windows Virtual PC Beta before installing Candidate Version. <br><br>  C / To run the Windows XP Mode environment on a computer, you need to use Windows Virtual PC.  Windows Virtual PC requires a processor that supports hardware virtualization;  AMD-V ‚Ñ¢ or Intel¬Æ VT technology must be enabled in the BIOS (note that it is often necessary to physically power off the computer to turn on hardware virtualization after configuring BIOS settings). <br><br>  D / Final RTM version will be available on October 22. <br><br>  E / Installation Procedure: <br><ol><li>  Install Virtual PC, x86 or x64 version </li><li>  Install Windows XP Mode. </li></ol><br>  Microsoft Enterprise Desktop Virtualization (MED-V) and Microsoft Application Virtualization (APP-V) are used to manage virtual machine infrastructure.  MED-V is part of the Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack (MDOP).  MED-V provides the ability to centrally create, install and update virtual images on a computer network across an entire organization.  MED-V is a structured control over the virtual machines of an entire enterprise.  Microsoft Application Virtualization (APP-V) is used to virtualize large-scale applications when an application is not installed on a client computer. <br><br>  G / This is my first article, not a translation.
