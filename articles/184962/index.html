  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Travel book tester</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b4d/fb0/2b5/b4dfb02b5e2b105f9e8c13ce16146843.jpg" alt="image"><br>  One of the problems of learning on the Internet is the fragmentation of the desired material.  The network is rich in sources of knowledge, but for a person starting his journey, it is sometimes difficult to decide what to read and what not.  Provided that he has already found the material he needs, it is even more difficult to decide which materials are dogmatic and which are just for reference. <br>  However, like 100 years ago, books can come to the rescue.  Unfortunately for many readers, most of them are written in English and for quite some time.  Let's see what you can read in Russian: <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1) Roman Savin ‚ÄúTesting Dot Com, or the Handbook on abuse of bugs in Internet start-ups‚Äù - An excellent book for the first step, trying to understand what testing is and who are testers.  He himself began with this book, but after that there were a lot of questions left;  it is more of an introductory material than serious literature.  Was published in 2007. <br><br>  2) Sam Kaner, Jack Folk, Eng Kek Nguyen Software Testing.  Fundamental concepts of business application management ‚Äù- Scientific and academic approach to software testing.  It‚Äôs boring, a lot of letters, and rarely anyone masters this book to half, but the theory in the book is capable of preparing a fundamental basis of knowledge, no matter how loud it sounds.  The book was published in 1993.

      <br>
      3) Robert Culbertson, Chris Brown, Gary Cobb ‚ÄúRapid Testing‚Äù - A serious language about a serious approach to testing.  The book is written with an academic approach and it can hardly be called easy reading.  But with the proper approach, it can be gleaned enough serious judgments about the testing process, a clear statement of how to organize this process, taking into account the observed changes.  The book was published in 2002. <br><br>  4) Boris Beizer ‚ÄúTesting the black box.  Technologies for functional testing of software and systems ‚ÄùWe quote the description: The book is recognized as a classic work in the field of behavioral testing of various systems. It deeply addresses the main issues of software testing that allow you to find the maximum errors with a minimum of time costs. The main testing methods covering all Spectra aspects of the development of software systems.  Methodicality and breadth of presentation make this book an indispensable tool in checking the correct functioning of software solutions. The book is intended for software testers and programmers seeking to improve the quality of their work. A very serious book is hidden behind these words, the study of which should also be approached very, very seriously.  The book was published in 2004. <br><br>  And the yard is already quite a hot summer of 2013, and the most "fresh" book was written 6 years ago!  Moreover, testing as an engineering practice develops in the same leaps and bounds as the entire industry.  Even 5 years ago, the theory was fine, but any employer needed a person with practical experience, which these books with all their academic character, unfortunately, cannot give. <br>  In connection with all of the above, I decided to change the situation.  The market is growing every day, new companies are opening up, start-ups are taking off, and the problem of competent personnel is becoming even more acute. <br><br>  Now for the young Padawan, who has chosen the light path of testing, it will become a bit easier to pass.  Over the past year in my free time I have been collecting and preparing materials for a book that can answer not only the question ‚Äúwhat is testing?‚Äù, But also explain how to test using modern practice design tests and relevant tools.  The purpose of my book is to prepare a person with a desire to study at a competitive junior level specialist. <br><br>  Now the book is 90% ready and will be distributed in a free way, a set of free software for testing will be attached to the material.  At the moment, final editing is underway, unfortunately it is a long and laborious process.  Estimated release date of the book is the end of summer 2013. <br><br>  What awaits the young Padawans inside (or a short table of contents): <br><br>  Introduction to the book <br><br>  1. Who is this book for? <br>  2. What is our goal? <br>  3. How is the book built? <br><br>  What is IT <br><br>  1. What is IT? <br>  2. Types of companies <br>  3.
