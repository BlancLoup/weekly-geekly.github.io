Their task is to fix the accident as soon as possible and restore the service.  Today we will take one of the trips with them. <br><br>  We really wanted to have an accident, but accidents (fortunately) are not every day.  On such days brigades are engaged in planning and maintenance work, but there will also be something to see. <br>  Attention, under the cut traffic.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/649fecaf/76350afe/4e9afead/19a47af2.jpg"><br><br>  It all starts with the project, the changes fit into the overall network topology.  The head issues the task to the brigade - today it is the forwarding of the CPSU (aerial cable junction) between the houses to increase the number of fibers between the segments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3b462675/fe41f2b2/7c7a41a7/f294aa24.jpg"><br><br>  The brigade is preparing to climb to the roof. <br>  Half the time takes access effort.  Go to SLM for the keys: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/71b111ff/efe45c58/5459c3b3/d6c6ca81.jpg"><br><br>  A hospitable corridor leads us to a cozy room: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/9db72344/1e1e6c57/fe018c82/75aee3b8.jpg"><br><br>  An employee presents an identity, signs for the receipt of keys.  Employees are registered in advance, getting the keys is not so easy.  They are on duty in the SLM around the clock, but they only give out keys during the day and not on weekends - they protect the residents' peace of mind.  Often this is the main reason that accidents that occurred on Friday can only be fixed on Monday.  From the outside, it looks like ‚Äúthe Internet broke down and was repaired only after three days,‚Äù but the operator‚Äôs fault is not there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/06468de4/b089ccdf/818765f4/68622e96.jpg"><br><br>  The lady of the SLM staff has a security desk, she reports that one of the keys we need is at the plumber, who is now in the basement of another house.  We go to catch the plumber: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/c51b2739/3a231b57/96b2fd5d/f23c4d03.jpg"><br><br>  - Petro-oh-oh-vich !!! <br>  We rise to the roof <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/361dc308/4e1e6bbe/3f411da4/7078a0b0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f9c6c876/78031b5c/b5797457/75901f47.jpg"><br><br>  This is probably the nicest side of the job.  Fresh air, beautiful view.  It would not get down. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/fe62f69e/41d999ae/ed996224/e40c0a43.jpg"><br><br>  On the average Moscow house - 3-4 cables from different operators.  We are for healthy competition. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/afc62a8d/a24caef3/9a574ac8/3c95d245.jpg"><br><br>  A colleague unwinds the cable and puts it on the roof.  For suspension between houses, a cable with a suspension cable, the so-called "eight" is used: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/200c3003/8152ed78/5cf88243/caa8caf8.gif"><br><br>  The strength element is a steel cable (1) on which a twist of modules hangs around a central strength element (usually a plastic rod - 2) in which optical fibers (3) float in a hydrophobic gel.  Hydrophobic gel prevents longitudinal distribution of moisture, if it falls inside the polybutylene terephthalate module.  The fibers are placed in the module in such a way that their length is 1-3% longer than the length of the module.  This is necessary to compensate for thermal expansion, so that at any load tensile forces are not transmitted to brittle fibers.  The sheath (7) is usually made of polyethylene, in which carbon black is added for light stabilization, since polyethylene decomposes under the action of ultraviolet (therefore, all cables for external installation are usually black) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/1d829d97/1f8fef2a/d09269e5/ead42330.jpg"><br><br>  Contrary to popular rumors, the cable between the houses is not forwarded with the help of silent crossbows and folding hang-gliders, but with such a device, called a walk-through or, in common monkey.  On rubberized rollers set in motion by a small electric motor that is powered by a battery, the monkey overcomes a rise of up to 30 degrees by catching on an already stretched cable.  If there is no cable, a rope comes down from two buildings, and its ends are tied on the ground, and then lifted to the roof. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f98fe29a/b4a7cab4/960cb6d9/04bb5615.jpg"><br><br>  Our monkey bears the proud name "KARABASik" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/cfb2bf6e/c0750bea/e4c9259c/5578572d.jpg"><br><br>  The monkey has gone!  And behind it and the cable ... <br>  The cable stretched between the houses pulls the cable over the studs fastened to the supporting wall and is tensioned with a lanyard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b7890b3f/fbec2381/12e71211/800a942c.jpg"><br><br>  Leaving the compensation ring to align tensile loads. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/cdb3d7fc/d2e61160/d747e5c5/48acdea6.gif"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a844254e/b6fd25ad/69bc3fa2/524ba383.jpg"><br><br>  The cable is inserted inside to break the fibers in our equipment.  The cable is laid in the corrugation, the input is sealed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f4e6e8aa/3d830cb3/71e5ba47/5dd2c9c9.jpg"><br>  Mandatory element - labeling, the cable has a number and a responsible one.  If the cable interferes with someone or something happens to it, we will come and repair it (about this in one of the following materials) <br><br>  PS This Thursday is scheduled <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/events/165/">excursion "One day with</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/events/165/"><br></a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/events/165/">installer "</a> , where you can see all the work of our unit <br>  and ask all your questions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130403/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130403/</a></p>
