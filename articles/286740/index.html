A panacea for business or a publicity stunt?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day. <br><h5>  Today I want to share my experience on the issue of <b>lead generation.</b> </h5><br>  For those who only saw this term: <br>  <b>Lead generation</b> is <i>the process of collecting leads, that is, getting the desired actions from the user.</i>  <i>This may be a purchase, left application, a completed application form, installation of the application, etc.</i>  <i>All that is valuable to you.</i> <br><br>  People are lazy creatures, and they do not like to waste their strength.  And for some reason they think that doing business can be easily and simply lying on the stove and not doing anything.  So customers come to us and ask to sell their product or service - this is normal, if not for a couple of ‚Äúbuts‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1) They sell a product or service that almost nobody needs (very specific). <br>  2) They try to save on everything that they can save on (in terms of business optimization, there is nothing bad, but there are things that cannot be saved, and this savings will cost them a lot of money later). <br>  3) They want a magic pill (for someone to solve all their problems).

      And these same people come and say: " <i>we want leads for 50 rubles each and that everyone buys everything, but then I will pay for it, you first sell me</i> ." <br><br>  Now let's see <b>how lead generation works?</b>  <b>What does lead cost depend on?</b> <br><br>  Let's look at an example: you organize English courses, you need customers and you want to attract them from the Internet. <br><br>  <b>Step 1:</b> Make a Landing Page.  You made yourself a Landing Page yourself or ordered a professional.  What's next? <br><br>  <b>Step 2:</b> Organize targeted traffic to the site.  Where to get traffic from? <br><br>  The easiest way is contextual advertising.  Great, but how to set it up?  You can spend a lot of time to learn how to configure it, step on all the rakes.  You can contact the "professionals."  But here, because of the desire to save money, you can stumble upon a person who does, somehow, and he will not bear any responsibility for the effectiveness of your spending. <br><br>  What other options are there: traffic from social networks.  There are a lot of "craftsmen" who are ready to put you a lot of visitors, promote a group, etc.  but as a rule they charge decent price tags!  (For reference, in order to ensure good traffic due to advertising in promoted groups, you need to allocate about 80-200 tr. (One advertising post in a good public will cost about 3-5 tr. So that it starts selling you need at least 10 posts, and to ensure good traffic you need to use 3-5 such public) <br><br>  Suppose you are lucky, you are all set up correctly and get targeted traffic to the site. <br>  You start receiving bids.  It is important to pay attention to how much it costs you one application.  practically no one considers this.  And in vain.  And here we are approaching the cost of the lead.  The cost of a lead is formed statistically, and it changes constantly.  This is a statistic, pay attention to it. <br><br>  The cost of the lead is formed as follows: <br><br>  <b>(cost of one transition to the site) * (number of transitions for the selected period) / (number of applications for the selected period)</b> <br><br>  From the formula it is clear that the lower the cost of a single transition and the more we get applications, the better! <br><br>  To improve these two parameters you need: <br><br>  1) Optimize advertising traffic so that it is better and cheaper. <br>  2) Optimize the site so that more people buy. <br><br>  This is where the dog is buried.  To optimize the site, rather time-consuming, long and costly process.  You need to collect a lot of statistics, analyze it, make changes to the site, and again collect statistics, analyze make changes, etc. <br><br>  It remains to fight for the low cost of the transition.  Here, too, is not so simple - as a rule, the warmer the traffic, the higher its cost.  So much to save, too, will not succeed.  With contextual advertising, it is realistic to receive leads of 400-700 rubles in some areas, however, in highly competitive prices can reach up to 2000-3000 rubles and more. <br><br>  Not so long ago, people began to want to pay not just for clicks and impressions, but for targeted actions of their potential or ready-made clients.  So the era of lead generation has come.  Now people have an alternative to contact a special agency and in fact ‚Äúbuy customers‚Äù!  It would seem that he is happy!  And it was not there. <br><br>  <b>Firstly,</b> not every lead generation agency will take you to its customers, and this is due to a number of factors: First, they may not like your product!  Seriously, if your product isn‚Äôt buying, webmasters who supply the lion‚Äôs share of the leads will not be able to make money on it and it will be more interesting for them to find another offer.  The second is a narrow specialization.  Again, if you cannot earn money, you are not interesting to anyone! <br><br>  <b>Secondly,</b> if you are not able to buy back large volumes of leads, it is not interesting to work with you, since the time and effort spent on preparation is much higher than earnings. <br><br>  <b>Thirdly, the</b> price of the lead in each case will be yours!  If you sell an expensive, highly specialized product, cook money, the price will be high. <br><br>  In conclusion, lead generation is not a panacea.  This is a great tool, but it is not suitable for everyone and you do not need to place high hopes on it.  If he believes that lead generation is your way out, finding the right agency is not so difficult, by typing in queries into the search engine (ordering lead generation, turnkey clients or something similar, you can quickly find those who will help you). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7da/2cd/351/7da2cd3511c54b959ea2e3d79a30a173.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Good luck, next time I will write in more detail how this works.  I'll tell you about the intricacies of the examples. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286740/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286740/</a></p>
