  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Step By Step: Making MPO (parcel) in the FCS (customs)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h1>  0. Purchase </h1><br>  Buy goods in the online store with delivery by mail.  Come to the post office to receive the parcel and ... if you receive it, then you can not read further. <br>  If instead of delivering the package to you, an employee of the Russian Post happily reports that she is detained by customs. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  1. Failure </h1><br>  At the post office you will receive a notification and a copy of the customs declaration attached to the parcel.  The notification will contain the address of the customs service where it is necessary to appear, but it is better to check the phone number of the customs office through 2gis or any available service and specify the time and place for the reception of citizens on your issue (we have a different address in the city in the main customs building). <br> <a title="Customs notice" href=""><img alt="Customs notice" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3f9/e27/183/3f9e27183bc87a92d7cd11e4a7d26cce.png"></a> <br><br><h1>  2. Preparation of documents </h1><br>  The parcel fell into the tenacious paws of the customs service of Russia and for its return to you you will have to collect some (not too large) number of documents: <br><ul><li>  Invoices (invoice) of online stores for the purchase of goods. </li><li>  Bank statement (important: dates and amounts must match the account). </li><li>  Copies of passports for themselves and all direct relatives (parents-children, brothers-sisters, husbands-wives and ... everything!), As well as copies of documents confirming your relationship (birth certificate, marriage registration). </li><li>  If customs officers are not able to identify the goods in the parcel in accordance with the customs declaration, then you may need printouts from the site of the store with a photo of the goods. </li><li>  If among your goods there are those that come with a restriction on import, then you need a certificate of registration of <a href="http://rospotrebnadzor.ru/e-government">Rospotrebnadzor</a> , proving that the import of this type of product is allowed into the territory of Russia. </li></ul><br>  Documents for relatives will be useful if you have in the package a lot of the same type of goods. <br><br><h1>  3. First visit </h1><br>  Come to customs, submit your passport through the window, a notice and a copy of the declaration.  In response, you will be given two forms: <br><ul><li>  Application for customs control. </li><li>  Explanation (write here what quantity and which of your direct relatives is in the package). </li></ul><br>  Fill out forms, also write an application for opening the parcel (they will take pictures and compare them with the declaration, and a dog handler with a dog will also be present). <br> <a title="Statement" href=""><img alt="Statement" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9b3/a31/b7c/9b3a31b7ce4487ca2e6ac1df7c728249.png"></a>

N-th visit (about money) </h1><br>  From the first call, not everything can grow together, but after reading this note, you are more or less prepared.  Yes, as I wrote in clause 2, employees may have doubts about the goods with import restrictions and ... an examination of the goods with a period of 1 month or more may be scheduled.  - it is better to refuse to receive the parcel with return to the sender, if this is possible in your case and more convenient for you, otherwise you will have to pass the goods for examination, as described in this <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/eCommerce/136870/">comment</a> . <br>  So, if all your documents are satisfied with customs officers and the main problem was that you imported several goods of the same type, then you will not have to pay money. <br>  If you exceed the amount of ‚Ç¨ 1,000 (important: if the declaration is in another currency, the cost is calculated at the exchange rate on the date of the application), then you will need to pay a fee of 30% over this amount. <br>  If your MPO is recognized as a commercial cargo, then you pay a duty of 30% of the amount of departure, but the most annoying thing is that commercial cargo is processed through a customs broker (at a bargain price). <br>  When paying, very carefully check the filling in of all the fields and details of the payment order, so my bank operator did not fill out field 107 (customs authority code) and the money was stuck in the FCS in Moscow, and did not come to the city customs.  I had to send a fax to Moscow with a request to correct the details in the system, call the bank so that they also sent a fax, and later also called by phone to Moscow. <br><br><h1>  5. Last visit </h1><br>  So, your money reached customs.  You need to come to the payment department.  And you will again need a certain amount of documents and their copies (!): <br><ul><li>  Passport. </li><li>  Certificate of tax registration (TIN). </li><li>  Payment receipt or payment order. </li></ul><br>  In the payments department you will be given the appropriate mark on the payment order. <br><img title="Mark on the payment" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3e5/01d/b54/3e501db545842dfafdc1f228a3466008.png"><br><br>  Customs officers are satisfied - you have fulfilled all their requirements.  They will issue all the necessary documents.  You will be given a Customs receipt and notice.  The notice stamped on the issuance of the parcel in the mail.  I wanted so much to get my things soon, that I didn‚Äôt go to scan the resolution and forgot to take pictures with my phone, so there‚Äôs no photo. <br><br><h1>  6. Presentation </h1><br>  You go to the post office and ... once again open the parcel and compare the attachments with the declaration, and only then safely take it. <br><br><h1>  7. How it was with me </h1><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  date </td><td>  Event </td></tr><tr><td>  01/16/2012 </td><td>  Called from the mail about the arrival of the parcel.
