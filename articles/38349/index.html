  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Word processors</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This is my first article on Habr√©, and please do not scold if somewhere I turn out to be biased or naive ... <br><h4>  Introduction </h4><br>  The first sketches of this article appeared when MSOffice 2007 was released - having seen that instead of expanding the functionality, the MS undertook to decorate the program.  Looking at this ... I decided to completely get rid of MSOffice and switch to an alternative package.  I first got OpenOffice, and so far, though not in everything, it suits me much more than MS.  However, I decided to reflect on the ideal word processor. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, let's find out what type of work a word processor is commonly used to write: <br><ol><li>  <b>Articles</b> , abstracts, reports up to the book.  This kind of work is written: students, journalists, writers.  They are characterized by a large amount of text and a small weight of design. </li><li>  <b>Web pages</b> - design is important here, which is filled with content later. </li><li>  <b>Documents</b> usually do not have a very large amount of text (in general ...) and must strictly comply with the standards. </li></ol><br>  On the basis of such a division, we will try to describe the methods of work for each gender. <br><h4>  Article. </h4><br>  As I have already noted, writing an article is distinguished by a large amount of text necessary for work.  Working with text in this case is usually divided into 3 stages: <b>typing</b> , <b>editing</b> and <b>layout</b> . <br><ul><li>  The first and biggest stage in writing an article is typing. <br>  At the exit we get a draft article.  At this stage it is advisable to take care of the structure of the text.  This will help save time during the editing stage and not miss the details that may be forgotten after this stage.  When typing, only the keyboard is usually used.  Appeal to the mouse at this stage should be minimized.  Frequent calls to the mouse slow down the work and can cause irritation.  Therefore, you need to have a convenient keyboard shortcut system in the word processor.  It is necessary to hang on the shortcut keys and work with the structure of the document, with files and bookmarks.  Of course, hints on combinations are necessary, but they must be unobtrusive and always in place.  A well-thought-out autochange system, the ability to insert pre-prepared graphics without using a mouse, extensive use of bookmarks will also be a good helper here. </li><li>  When <b>editing, the</b> mouse and keyboard are usually used with almost the same intensity, and by the end of the editing process the mouse is used more often.  At this stage, a good clipboard manager is important (by the way, there is no normal BO manager in Win or Lin, and the one that exists in MSOffice only works when MSOffice is running, and besides it slows down a lot), as well as notes in the text.  Need a good navigation system for the previously left marks.  It is better to put all the main actions performed at this stage on the toolbars and on the context menus. </li><li>  With the final <b>layout</b> more important is not so much convenience as functionality.  Both the keyboard and the clipboard are used infrequently.  All basic operations are performed using the mouse.  Here, the visibility and unambiguity of the result is important (the latter is clearly lacking in MSOffice: it often takes a very long time to put the picture in the right place, because it constantly jumps in different directions from the cursor.).  Many tools for this stage can be hidden in the application menu and in the context menus, as well as in separate windows. </li></ul><br><h4>  Webpage. </h4><br>  The process of creating this kind of text differs in a different order of actions: first, there is a layout, in which the structure of the future work is laid out, and only then the form is filled with content.  This is due to the fact that the form in this case is all the more important.  Often it is better to make a form in another program, and to use a word processor to create marked up text, which another program then absorbs. <br><h4>  Document. </h4><br>  When creating documents, as already noted, the compliance of the form with the standards is of great importance.  Therefore, the creation of the document usually begins with the opening of the template, which is then filled with the necessary content.  Thus, the third stage is excluded in most cases before the creation of the document.  And the first and second are already inseparable.  In this case, the functionality of the word processor may be minimal.  Therefore, IMHO in the office in the workplace of some secretary or petty <br>  the head will be enough and lightweight version of the word processor. </div>
