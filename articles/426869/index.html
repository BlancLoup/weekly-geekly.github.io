  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to effectively conduct videoconferencing with foreign customers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When working with foreign customers and partners, there is a need to discuss something via video link.  For this you can use the good old Skype or any other program for video communication.  How to successfully negotiate with a foreign partner on a video link and which vocabulary is useful?  We understand together. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_3/0w/un/_30wunjrc6n8cpm5vmbkxk2ku4q.jpeg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Why is video calling more convenient than mail? </h3><br>  First, one of the large-scale foreign studies showed that the participants in the negotiations conducted by email were less satisfied with their quality, as well as the result, than the employees who communicated in the face-to-face mode.  Video conferencing also provides an excellent opportunity for negotiation if participants are located in different countries. <br><br>  Secondly, it is proved that we are more concentrated if we interact with someone who is in close proximity to us than when we do not see the interlocutor.  Due to the possibility of video calls, we not only communicate with potential partners with voice, but also provide eye contact, which enhances the effect of presence.  Also, the possibility of demonstrating the screen to the interlocutor in real time and sending materials during the conversation make the event even more close to a real business meeting.

    <h3>  We work on the result </h3><br>  So, how to conduct such negotiations as efficiently as possible? <br><br>  <b>1) Mind the body language</b> <br><br>  Gestures and facial expressions of the interlocutor can tell us a lot about him - give him excitement or emotion, and, accordingly, help us to understand in which direction to go further.  Due to the possibility of video communication, during negotiations we can track in time the reactions of those with whom we are talking. <br><br>  <b>2) Prepare your surroundings</b> <br><br>  If you are negotiating outside your office, think about the background in advance.  Also, do not choose too noisy and crowded place. <br><br>  <b>3) Be an active listener</b> <br><br>  The technique of active listening is distributed in video calls.  Do not forget to respond to the remarks of your interlocutor, show that you are interested in his words.  Russian, in principle, offers quite a few options as methods of active listening (most likely, the most popular, which will be remembered by many, will be the notorious "Yeah" or "yes"), but English offers much more possibilities in this regard: <br><br><ul><li>  Hm ... </li><li>  Yes ... </li><li>  Really? </li><li>  I see ... </li><li>  Let me make it. </li><li>  I get the impression that ... </li><li>  In your experience ... </li><li>  I have noticed that ... </li><li>  It sounds like ... </li></ul><br><h3>  Negotiate correctly </h3><br>  And, of course, no negotiations can do without specialized vocabulary.  We give examples of words that may be useful to you: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Bottom line</b> - the most important factor (we are ready to offer you all our corporate discounts) </li><li>  <b>Agenda</b> - agenda, program (So let's discuss the most significant points of today's agenda) </li><li>  <b>Counter proposal</b> - this proposal has exceeded all expectations. The counter offer received exceeded all their expectations. </li><li>  <b>Deadlock</b> - deadlock (We had to break a bit - we had to take a short break, because our negotiations were deadlocked) </li></ul><br><h3>  How to start </h3><br>  When starting negotiations, you can use phrases that will help you draw the attention of other participants to the most important aspects that you are to discuss: <br><br><ul><li>  <i>So let's start by looking at the issues</i> that we have on the agenda. </li><li>  <i>Before we begin, should we discuss the most important points of today's agenda?</i>  - Before we begin, can we get acquainted with the most important agenda items? </li></ul><br><h3>  How to continue </h3><br>  Supporting the discussion is very important - and it is important to do it right.  To do this, you can use the following expressions: <br><br><ul><li>  <i>Do you have any suggestions for ...?</i>  - Do you have any suggestions about ...? </li><li>  <i>May I ask you to suggest the course of action for ...?</i>  - Can I clarify what course of action you are offering for ...? </li><li>  <i>What are your views on ...?</i>  - What is your position on the issue ...? </li><li>  <i>First of all ... Secondly ... Last but not the least ...</i> - My decision is based on three factors ... First of all ... Secondly ... And last, but last but not least, an important .. . </li><li>  <i>One of the key reasons for this is ...</i> - One of the key reasons for this decision is ... </li></ul><br><h3>  How to politely disagree </h3><br>  Of course, you will not agree on everything with your opponent.  The main thing is to be able to express your opinion clearly and firmly, but at the same time extremely politely, without expressing disrespect for the point of view of the interlocutor.  For example: <br><br><ul><li>  <i>I agree with your suggestion</i> - I accept your offer </li><li>  <i>I am afraid I can't agree with you but ...</i> - I'm <i>afraid I can't agree with you</i> , but ... </li><li>  <i>We could offer you ... if you can agree on ...</i> - If you agree to ... we could offer you .... </li><li>  <i>Offering you ... now is the best we can</i> offer you at the moment is ... </li><li>  <i>We could be able to work on ..., if you could ...</i> - If you could ..., we could see what can be done on the question ... </li></ul><br><h3>  How to finish on a high note </h3><br>  To finish the negotiations correctly is also important.  Examples of good final phrases that will help you to summarize a business meeting: <br><br><ul><li>  <i>Let's sum up the most important points of our discussion?</i>  - Let's summarize the points discussed </li><li>  <i>To conclude, I would like to say ...</i> - In conclusion, I would like to say ... </li><li>  <i>So let's have a look at what we decided to do</i> . </li></ul><br>  If you want to upgrade your English, come to us. <br><br>  Readers of the blog give a <a href="https://puzzle-english.com/%3Fcoupon_id%3D0f7c0264%26tid%3Dhabr">coupon</a> for 700 rubles for the purchase of "Tasks". </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/426869/">https://habr.com/ru/post/426869/</a></p>
