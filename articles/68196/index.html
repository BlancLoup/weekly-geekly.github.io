  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview of goods and services that can be paid through the "Personal Account QIWI"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, the system‚Äôs partners are more than 1,000 companies, whose services and goods can be paid for.  And this is not counting Robokassa, in which another 1000 counterparties are registered.  Only for the last month, payment in <a href="http://mylk.qiwi.ru/index.do">‚ÄúQIWI LC‚Äù</a> was paid in more than 250 stores. <br>  Most recently launched an affiliate program with <a href="http://visa.1pb.ru/">"Virtual Visa Card"</a> .  This is a way to pay in online stores without using a physical bank card. <br>  Instead of real VISA, virtual parameters are entered. <br><br>  For convenience, all partners of the payment system "LC QIWI" and their services are combined into categories.  Now this list looks like this: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  cellular <br>  Antivirus <br>  Internet, IP-telephony <br>  Pay TV <br>  Payment systems <br>  Commerce <br>  Housing and communal services <br>  Entertainment <br>  Other <br>  Credits <br>  Flights <br>  Other <br><br>  Yes, yes, with the help of "LC QIWI" you can quietly pay for utilities.

      The catalog called ‚Äú <b>Entertainment</b> ‚Äù was not so diverse.  I will list all the services for which you can pay in this way: <br>  Mamba, Vkontakte, LovePlanet, Fidel, SinglCity, Monamour, Smeshariki, Muzclub and Virtonomika.  This is not counting the numerous games, which took their subsection and the list is much longer.  Here and Perfect World and 11x11 - what is there just not, even some kind of hochka.ru.  Surprisingly - on the site of the latter indicated that this is a directory of <u>free</u> games. <br><br>  But the most interesting is stored in the " <b>Other</b> " tab. <br>  In this category, you can find a lot of useful, and often unexpected.  Here is the payment for hosting, software and navigation.  There are few programs represented, but there is a MOVAVI and MS Office'07 video converter. <br><br>  Here you can pay for the flower delivery service Send Flowers (part of the international network AMF).  We are not saints, and everyone at least once in their lives remembered the birthday of their mother, mother-in-law or girlfriend at the very last moment.  And in such a situation, a beautiful and expensive bouquet (3000-10000 rubles), which can be bought for two clicks, is very helpful. <br><br>  To the bouquet, you can attach something from the universal goods Oriflame or Faberlic and pay for the purchase of the "LC QIWI".  True, you need to be their consultant to be able to buy directly on the site.  But register is easy. <br><br>  And if you have a little gift on a gift, you can find a small order on free-lance.ru, execute it anonymously, and get the money directly to your account in the QIWI dashboard.  And the money will come without withdrawing interest, if the customer also uses "LC QIWI". <br><br>  Here you can pay for the services of the "United service of paid advertisements", which is used by a number of periodicals. <br><br>  The most exotic, in my opinion, products that I discovered here are the following. <br><br>  In case you decide to earn some money as an autoengineer, place an ad on Spokoyno.ru. <br><br>  I was a little afraid of what lies behind the name ‚ÄúGrade 5.ru‚Äù, thinking, have our teachers really mastered the newest technical tools and now take money for evaluations like this?  It turned out that this is a paid service for parents, allowing almost in real time to monitor the performance of their child. <br><br>  Sebedom is a name that evokes the feeling that things in the real estate market are so bad that you can now buy a home by paying for the purchase with an electronic payment.  Despite the promising sound, this is just a site with ads for buying / selling real estate. <br><br>  A similar case is Roszem, the site of Russian lands, which is not at all historical or geographical, although it contains information of this kind.  Do you want to buy a piece of fertile land to grow organic tomatoes or do you dream to get rid of the field where mother-in-law demands planting potatoes every year?  It is there.  For the announcement of the sale will have to pay. <br>  I was intrigued by the name CobraConnex.  It turned out that this is a satellite anti-theft complex, with a subscription fee for use. <br><br>  I was pleased with the name of the Internet advertising agency - ‚ÄúShmugl‚Äù, which takes money for placing ads, and positions its site as a search engine without garbage.  In my opinion, too pretentious statement. <br><br>  Interested in the site WishOn.ru, where you can enroll in photography courses, in particular, in the style of Nu.  The truth does not specify whether a model will be provided for training :-) It is necessary to pay for courses no later than 5 days before the start, and it is very convenient to do so through ‚ÄúLC QIWI‚Äù. <br><br>  By the way, any online store or paid service can connect to ‚ÄúQIWI LC‚Äù in just a few days.  This will allow you to take a prepayment and avoid collisions with unscrupulous customers.  You can do it <a href="http://ishop.qiwi.ru/">here</a> . <br><br>  <b>What other partners would you like to see in QIWI LC?</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/68196/">https://habr.com/ru/post/68196/</a></p>
