On average, one in ten employees lost their jobs through no fault of their own.  In 2013, the unemployment rate in Russia was 5.8%, in Ukraine - exactly 8%, and in Germany - 5.3%.

    <h5>  <b>Freelancers in the EU</b> </h5><br><br>  Since the beginning of the global economic downturn in the European Union, there has been a rapid development of a new working class - independent specialists or freelancers.  Since 2004, the number of such workers has increased by 45% from 6.2 million to 8.9 million in 2013.  They averaged 25% of the EU workforce. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c4/5e8/5d3/2c45e85d3dfc407e8bce575ce2793490.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br><h5>  <b>Freelancers in the USA</b> </h5><br><br>  In the past 2015, in the USA, workers at outsourcing accounted for about 34% of the labor force in the country.  The total number of freelancers in America also increased by 700 thousand people.  since 2014. <br><br>  According to the <i>Freelance Union</i> survey, 60% of freelancers started their activities as independent or temporary employees at will.  In addition, they claim that they began to earn more after leaving a permanent job.  Half of the free specialists love their work so much that they would not refuse freelancing for any money. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e0/c86/799/0e0c86799d7f4f209bb7dd8233dbb40a.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br><h5>  <b>Freelancers in Russia</b> </h5><br><br>  By the beginning of 2015, there were about 2 million freelancers in Russia.  According to the National Research University Higher School of Economics, 79% of Russian freelancers consider the greatest advantage of remote work to be the ability to freely manage their own time and draw up their own work schedule.  Not the size of earnings played a key role in choosing the type of activity.  But there are drawbacks.  Almost half (44%) of independent specialists consider the main flaw in remote work to be a high probability of fraud.  Unscrupulous customers may not pay for the work, receiving ready-made materials from a freelancer. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/55c/341/f2a/55c341f2a0cf4d94a49bda09f0bda79f.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  In Russia, of the total number of freelancers, designers are the most - about 38%.  In second place are our favorite translators and copywriters (33%).  3rd and 4th place is shared by developers and programmers - 29% and 20%, respectively. <br><br><h5>  <b>Freelancers in Ukraine</b> </h5><br><br>  In 2014, Ukrainian freelancers earned more than $ 60 million, and in the following - about a quarter more (about $ 75 million).  Despite the fact that since January 2016 in Ukraine they have reduced the rate of ERUs by almost 2 times from 41% to 22%, small and medium business owners traditionally and quite logically try to minimize their costs.  One of the conditions for reducing the rate of the Ministry of Economy indicated precisely the increase in salaries to full-time employees.  To, so to speak, ‚Äúkill 2 birds with one stone‚Äù (use a reduced rate and pay a lower salary), Ukrainian companies increasingly resort to the services of remote employees.  In the past 2015, 20% of companies in the country hired freelancers for temporary work.  The benefits of such cooperation are obvious: companies save 1.7 billion hryvnia per year due to the lack of the need to purchase equipment for an employee, rent space for a workplace, as well as reduce tax payments. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4cc/831/99c/4cc83199c46e46848ea17727549c86e5.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  A joint study of the analytical company <i>GFK Ukraine</i> and <i>Bitrix24</i> showed that the smaller the business, the more actively it cooperates with independent experts.  This proves the trend of rapid growth of startups compared to large companies that are already long on the market.  Startups are more mobile and willingly introduce new technologies and popular trends into their work.  In addition, more and more startups use so-called <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE">lean-principles</a> in the development of their business. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/66e/cfa/33c/66ecfa33cf184dccbdff06e01ce4fa3d.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Every year the freelance movement is gaining more and more turns.  The number of freelancers is also growing and it is predicted that by 2025 it will be 3 billion people worldwide.  There are a lot of reasons why people work at outsourcing - quite a lot. <br><br><h5>  <b>The reasons for the increase in the number of freelancers</b> </h5><br><br><ul><li>  Rising unemployment and job cuts </li><li>  Ability to work anywhere in the world and for any company </li><li>  Income depends on the employee, not on the employer </li><li>  Free schedule </li><li>  Save time and money on the way to work and back home </li><li>  Free choice of activity </li><li>  Reducing the influence of the ‚Äúhuman factor‚Äù </li></ul><br><br>  Sometimes there are even terms denoting the specialization of freelancers, such as a devlancer (freelancer-developer) or lingvolansser - a freelancer of the language sphere ( <a href="https://2polyglot.com/ru">translators, copywriters, tutors of foreign languages, guides and translators</a> ).  According to <i>Payonneer</i> , only 44% of independent specialists find work on freelance exchanges. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/94c/570/960/94c5709608ed4569b660272e8af9e76f.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  The <i><a href="http://www.segodnya.ua/">Segodnya</a> newspaper</i> reports that according to its data, 35% of Ukrainian companies will have virtual workplaces already by 2017.  We hope that by that time there will be no problems with the <a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/polyglot/blog/24818/">design of the activities of freelancers</a> . <br><br><h5>  <b>Why do companies hire freelancers</b> </h5><br><br><ul><li>  90% of top managers believe that outsource is economically beneficial </li><li>  A remote employee every year saves the company an average of 17,000 hryvnia by reducing costs. </li><li>  No need for constant monitoring </li><li>  Increase productivity </li><li>  More flexible work schedule </li><li>  The possibility of hiring workers from different countries and cities </li></ul><br><br>  It is significant that it is Ukrainian independent developers that occupy the largest share of the freelancing market in Eastern Europe.  According to <i>TopsDev</i> , half of all tasks for programmers in this region come from US customers. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/282/f7a/abb/282f7aabbe4241de801f5f82d6959495.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  The growth of the freelance services market undoubtedly bears great benefit for small and medium business owners.  Perhaps in the near future we will see an even greater increase in the loyalty of employers to independent specialists and will witness the trend of providing a social package for freelancers.  Increasing competition among freelancers inevitably leads to an improvement in the development of their professional skills, as well as to a reduction in the cost of services.  And this can not fail to please potential employers. <br><br>  On the other hand, with the development of technology and globalization, the demand for knowledge in the field of digital technologies and knowledge of several foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãis growing.  So in the near future, hired employees with demanded skills of job cuts in companies are not afraid. <br><br>  Materials prepared by site <a href="https://2polyglot.com/">2polyglot.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299884/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299884/</a></p>
