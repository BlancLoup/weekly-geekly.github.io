  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Stephen Hawking's latest theory will prove the existence of parallel universes.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dk/-c/b0/dk-cb0-lmi12tds8ln2q9jo7bym.jpeg"><br><br><p>  Before his death, the great scientist in a group with colleagues for several years developed his ‚Äúfinal‚Äù theory.  Now it is being reviewed in one of the scientific journals, and will be published after verification.  This theory should show what characteristics our world should have if it is part of the multiverse.  Hawking's colleagues say that this work would have earned him a Nobel Prize, which he never received during his lifetime. <a name="habracut"></a></p><br><p>  The theory is called A Smooth Exit from Eternal Inflation ("Smooth way out of eternal inflation").  Scientists who helped Stephen Hawking while working, say that this may be his most important scientific legacy, more important than his work on the study of black holes.  In his theory, he sets the necessary mathematics, allowing the space shuttle to find the traces of several Big Bangs.  Previously, most physicists and cosmologists believed that it was technically impossible to confirm the existence of the multiverse from our universe. </p><br><p>  The scientist finished work shortly before his death.  The new publication will also solve the problem posed by Hawking in his 1983 "boundless" theory.  She explained how the universe began to exist as a result of the Big Bang.  According to the theory, the Universe has expanded from a microscopic point to a prototype in a fraction of a second in the prototype of where we live now - thanks to a process known as ‚Äúinflation‚Äù.  But the same theory predicted the possibility of an infinite number of Big Bangs, where everyone would create their own Universe.  The result was an infinite multiverse that posed a mathematical paradox.  It is not only impossible to measure, it does not make sense to measure it. </p><br><p>  Scientists have defended themselves from this endless multiverse using the anthropic principle.  Like, our Universe is what it is, because we live in it.  Each value of world constants happened randomly.  In other worlds with other laws of nature, we would not exist.  Such an approach confuses many physicists - ‚Äúif all constants are random, is there any point in trying to find logic in the characteristics of our Universe‚Äù? </p><br><p>  New theory of Hawking will remove anthropic arguments, they can be used only for a limited number of parameters (for example, to explain why inflation is accelerating slowly).  Also, in all likelihood, the number of universes in the multiverse is not infinite, as previously assumed, but limited.  This means that their parameters can be measured and calculated. </p><br><p>  Carlos Frank, a professor of cosmology at the University of Durham, explains that the main achievement of the theory is that it is relatively easy to confirm (at least by the standards of modern physics).  There is no need to build the Large Hadron Collider.  A moving spacecraft with a detector that reads background radiation is enough ‚Äî an imprint of the first seconds after the Big Bang ‚Äî in search of traces of the multiverse. </p><br><p>  Professor Thomas Hertog of Leuven University in Belgium, who worked on the new theory with Hawking, says that he met with a scientist only two weeks ago to discuss the latest details: </p><br><blockquote>  He was often nominated for Nobel, and had to get it.  Now he can never again. <br></blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/go/1p/ru/go1pruwn1zfi8w4jogrmnch1tq8.jpeg"><br><br><p>  So far, Hawking's theory has not yet been tested and published in scientific journals, but you can read it in free access <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.07702v2.pdf">here</a> .  Free, online PDF, really you need to be about Steven Hawking to understand something. </p></div>
