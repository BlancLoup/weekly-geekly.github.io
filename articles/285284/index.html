  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The art of public speaking or analyzing the speech of Steve Jobs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Have you always admired Steve Jobs' ability to introduce new Apple products?  Watching Steve Ballmer’s report in Moscow with interest?  Were surprised by the fact that Fidel Castro presented a speech of 27 hours?  And, most importantly, you want to learn how to make the same amazing presentations and make equally ardent speeches? <br><br>  Six months ago, studying the biography of Steve Jobs, I read and looked at the famous <a href="http://olololololololololo.habrahabr.ru/blog/23512/">"Three Stories"</a> , told to graduates of Stanforth University.  Undoubtedly, this is one of the most famous, interesting and instructive speeches Jobs.  Having rummaged in a network, I have found <a href="http://sixminutes.dlugan.com/2007/11/27/video-critique-steve-jobs-stanford-2005/">good analysis of the speech</a> .  Here is a rough translation of this analysis (find inaccuracies and errors - unsubscribe in the comments). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Analysis of the speech of Steve Jobs "Stay hungry, stay reckless" </h4><br>  Steve Jobs wrote and presented the talk speech “Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish” to the graduates of Stanford University on June 12, 2005.  The style and content of the speech were very different from his presentations of Apple products, but no less worthy of consideration. <br><br>  Important elements of this remarkable speech include: openness, a simple classical structure, the Rule of Three, rich speech patterns and a recurring theme of birth / death / rebirth.

      My suggestion is to: <br>  1. Watch the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DUF8uR6Z6KLc">video</a> ; <br>  2. Read the analysis below; <br>  3. If you wish, read the full transcript of the speech <a href="http://olololololololololo.habrahabr.ru/blog/23512/">(rus)</a> <a href="http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html">(eng)</a> in order to better understand it; <br>  4. Share your opinion on this presentation.  What did you like?  What would you do better? <br><br><h5>  Openness  Praise the audience, humility. </h5><br>  Jobs begins his speech with a compliment to the audience: <i>"It is a great honor for me to be with you today at the presentation of diplomas from one of the best universities in the world</i> . <i>"</i>  Further, he shows humility by acknowledging that he did not finish college.  In just a few sentences, he creates a positive attitude of the audience towards himself and heightens his susceptibility to his message. <br><br><h5>  Conversational style </h5><br>  Compare <i>"Stephen Wozniak and I Founded Apple</i> " with <i>"Woz and I Founded Apple"</i> <br>  1. The first part is formal and creates an idea about the two entrepreneurs who founded Apple; <br>  2. The second part is informal and creates an idea of ​​two close friends.  Jobs chose a conversational style and this is a wise choice.  His audience consists of graduates, whose completion of studies often means different further life paths of close friends. <br><br><h5>  Simple structure and suggestions. </h5><br>  Jobs has a simple and traditional structure: an introduction, then three stories and a conclusion.  He leads the audience for 14 and a half minutes, using simple sentences: <br>  <i>“Today I want to tell you three stories”</i> <i><br></i>  <i>“The first story is about connecting points”</i> <i><br></i>  <i>“My second story is about love and loss”</i> <i><br></i>  <i>“My third story is about death”</i> <br><br><h5>  Pauses and coordination in time </h5><br>  Jobs uses spectacular pauses after and, especially, after key points, allowing the audience to comprehend them. <br>  For example, he completes his first story, clearly referring to Robert Frost <i>’s</i> poem “The Road Not Taken” <i>“even when it’s not so good.”</i> This is followed by six seconds of silence.  These words are full of humor, but I felt that the comedic component was missing.  Perhaps this was his deliberate goal of imitating an academic speaker?  Despite this, time alignment was missing in some climaxes. <br><br>  For example, consider his phrase <i>"I did not even know what the pancreas is</i> . <i>"</i>  (10:07) There is only a small hint of emphasis, and no hint of a pause, before or after.  I would like more.  This is a special, tense moment in speech, and the audience will try to ease it with laughter. <br>  And a minute and a half later, he performs an even more beautiful trick, squirting a dose of humor into the essence of such a serious point: <i>“Nobody wants to die.</i>  <i>Even people who want to go to heaven do not want to die</i> . <i>”</i>  (11:40) <br>  Coordination of time is shown here very well. <br><br><h5>  Rule of Three </h5><br>  Jobs builds his speech around three main points, and he applies the rule of three in many sentences and paragraphs. <br>  <i>“I learned [1] <b>about</b> serif and sans serif, [2] <b>about the</b> different indents between the combinations of letters, [3] <b>about</b> what makes excellent typography beautiful” (3:39)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>“She was [1] beautiful, [2] historic, [3] artistically refined ...” (3:47)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>“Founded NeXT, another company called Pixar and fell in love with an amazing woman” ... (7:16)</i> <br>  - Jobs follows the principle of three sentences, thus emphasizing how important each part of them is. <br>  <i>“A foreign opinion, <b>all this</b> pride, <b>all this</b> fear of embarrassment or failure”</i> <i><br></i>  <i>“ <b>It means</b> trying to tell your children what you would say in the next 10 years.</i>  <i><b>It means to</b> make sure that everything is safely arranged, so that your family will be as easy as possible.</i>  <i><b>It means</b> saying goodbye. ”(10:28)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>“ <b>Do</b> not waste it (time) on the life of someone else's life.</i>  <i><b>Do not</b> fall into the trap of dogma, which says to live with the thoughts of others.</i>  <i><b>Do not</b> let the noise of others' opinions interrupt your inner voice "(12:18)</i> <br><br>  Some of the examples (in bold) are examples of anaphora intake - the repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of a sentence or sentence. <br><br><h5>  Abundance of speech turns </h5><br>  Jobs uses a large number of speech turns in his speech: <br><br>  <b>Antitheses</b> - the figure of speech, used as a juxtaposition of contrasting words, often in a parallel structure.  Jobs uses some very powerful examples. <br>  <i>“If I had not expelled, I would have never signed up” (4:34)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>“You can’t connect the dots by looking forward;</i>  <i>you can connect them only looking to the past ”(4:40)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>“Death is probably the best invention of Life” (11:55)</i> <br><br>  <b>Syntactic parallelism</b> (and other examples of anaphor) <br>  <i>“My foster mother is not a college graduate, and my father has never been a graduate of a school” (10:38)</i> <br><br>  <b>Anadiplosis</b> (repeating a phrase from the end of one sentence and from the beginning of another) <br>  <i>“The only way to be completely content is to do what you think is a great thing.</i>  <i>And the only way to do great things is to love what you do. ”</i> <br>  This example is good, but it is a bit lost from the repetition of the “only way” <br><br>  Assonance (repetition of vowel sounds) - “I always need to change something.” (And as soon as the answer was “No,” for several days in a row, I understood that something needs to be changed). <br><br><h5>  Reiteration </h5><br>  In addition to the numerous examples highlighted earlier, Jobs ends his speech by repeating “Stay hungry.  Stay reckless ”three times.  Repetition adds strength to a key argument, especially in conclusion. <br><br><h5>  Repeating themes of the speech "Birth, death, rebirth" </h5><br>  In the literal sense, Jobs' story about his birth is the first story, about the proximity of death - the third story.  However, this speech contains numerous other metaphorical references to the concept of the “Circle of Life”: <br><br><ul><li>  In addition to his physical birth, Jobs tells how the couple initially decided that they want a girl (symbolic death, because his life is “cut short” due to “sex change”).  Then he talks about the successful experience of "rebirth" with his parents. </li><li>  His college life had a short life.  The “death” of his official educational process gave birth to his informal educational process. </li><li>  His relationship with Apple is "in (20 years old) was born, grew up, and then died."  "Later, when Apple was acquired by NeXT, his career at Apple is reborn." </li><li>  He uses the word "Revival" to describe the current state of Apple. </li><li>  He is diagnosed with cancer (one "death sentence"), but then suffers a successful operation (rebirth). </li><li>  Stuart Brand, creator of the Whole Earth Catalog, "made several releases," and "in the end, they published the final issue </li></ul><br><br>  Spilling such stories, Jobs repeatedly links them to the audience.  This is especially clear in the conclusion, when it concerns this metaphor for the audience for the last time: <i>“And now, when you graduate from the institute and start anew ...”</i> <br><br><h5>  Your thoughts? </h5><br>  Did you like this speech?  What do you want from public speaking?  How could this presentation be improved? <br><br>  <a href="http://sixminutes.dlugan.com/2007/11/27/video-critique-steve-jobs-stanford-2005/">Original in English</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285284/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285284/</a></p>
