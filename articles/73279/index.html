  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Education for future IT professionals in Russia: VMK MSU</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many have heard about the success of students of St. Petersburg State University ITMO at world-class competitions.  These successes have made this university very popular among future potential IT specialists.  Therefore, now it is quite difficult to get there, and, of course, it is unrealistic to a special group of olympiads, which is logical.  However, one should not forget about another well-known state university in the country - MSU.  If ITMO St. Petersburg State University took the first place in programming in the world in 2008, then Moscow State University received a silver medal, taking the fifth place, which is also quite good.  The Faculty of the VMC (Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics) is the second most popular IT faculty in the country. ( <a href="">Photo of the building</a> ) So that's exactly what it will be about.  Let's look at how IT specialists prepare in one of the main universities of the country <b>in the first year</b> from the inside.  Please do not count for faculty advertising. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Introduction </h3><br><blockquote>  Programmers are not born - they become </blockquote>  I think that few people will begin to challenge this thesis.  In principle, programming is a relatively new "art", so the amount of information needed to work in this area is not so great, in contrast to mathematics, physics, or chemistry.  Hence, self-taught programmers who can do their job just as well as a person with a higher education.  However, due to the relevance of this area, almost all technical universities have IT faculties.  MSU is one of the pioneers of this trend.  The faculty of the VIC was established in 1970, and therefore the teaching system can be considered established.  All that is written here is 100% copyright, since I myself am a student of this department.  If you have not highlighted any aspects of interest to you, then I will be happy to answer your questions in the comments. <br><br><h3>  Receipt </h3><br>  As I already said, it is not so difficult to enter here, as in specials.  ITMO group, but still not easy.  Especially this year, the new exam system.  It was necessary to pass the following exams in the Unified State Examination form: mathematics, Russian, physics, computer science.  The passing score this year is 323 out of 400. So the average passing is: 81. It seems to me that this is quite acceptable.  By the way, in ITMO, the passing score for applied mathematics is also 81, which means that students have approximately the same level of knowledge in these universities.  Certainly, the equality of the Russian language and other subjects was the most difficult element of admission, since quite often a student who is well-versed in technical sciences is not very well educated humanitarian.  No, not because the technician cannot study the humanities, but because he devotes much less time to them due to the lack of interest in them. <br><br><h3>  Hostel </h3><br>  The eternal problem of many universities.  There was already a two-year experience of living in a dormitory (SSC of NSU) behind my back, so I did not have to get used for a long time.  Conditions are quite normal.  There is only one problem: the toilet is quite far from our room, but these are small things.  You can estimate the situation of the room yourself by visiting this link: <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/sstikhonov/oFBZjI%3Ffeat%3Ddirectlink">Photo of the hostel (PicasaWeb)</a> .  Specially cleaned nothing to show you the average situation. <br>  Entertainment in the hostel is enough.  On each floor, except the first and second, there are tables for table tennis.  On the second floor there are sofas with a plasma TV, where football and hockey matches are played, as well as a celebration of the session handed over :) And also among the first-year students, the Killer game is widely popular: the game organizers distribute to each participant a card with the name of the one they need to ‚Äúkill "(To be alone with him and take his card from him);  The killed person gives his card to the person who ‚Äúkilled him‚Äù and the name on this card becomes the next target, and so on, until two remain.  The game has to acquaintances and funny moments when one person expels all but one, to be alone with him and kill him.  You can try to play this game in your office :)

    <h3>  Program </h3><br>  We have a total of 18-19 pairs per week: 4 lectures and 4 seminars in mathematics, 2 lectures and 2 seminars on the theory of algorithms and algorithmic languages, a lecture and a history workshop, two pairs of physical education, a pair of life style and two pairs of English. <br>  More about each item: <br>  <b>Theory of Algorithms and YP</b> : Everything begins with a Turing Machine and Markov Algorithms, after which a smooth transition to algorithmic programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãoccurs.  In many universities first-year students begin to immediately read "C", and we - Pascal.  I do not know for sure whether this is good or bad, but they say it is good. <br>  <b>English language:</b> at the end of each month we need to prepare a mini essay in English on any topic related to mathematics or IT.  For example, in September I prepared and told a lecture about Qt Development Frameworks, someone told about Farm Theorem, someone about quantum computers, etc.  It is prohibited to use Wikipedia and sites such as TechCrunch, etc.  But the hardest is home reading.  For a month, you need to read 80 pages of an English book and prepare for a test of these 80 pages.  Perhaps it is not difficult if there would be time for it, but it is almost there.  This whole system is mainly aimed at improving vocabulary and colloquial speech.  We will deal with grammar later. <br>  <b>Mathematics</b> : In the first semester, mathematics is a mathematical analysis and linear algebra with analytical geometry.  They say that mathematical analysis is the most difficult thing in the first year and I, perhaps, agree, but it is much more interesting than linear algebra.  In the second semester, discrete mathematics will be added. <br>  <b>History</b> : This is where a lot depends on the teacher.  I was lucky: I have a teacher who believes that we, the technicians, need only a superficial knowledge of history, so it‚Äôs not difficult to get a credit with us: you need to prepare a summary of any of the topics suggested.  For example, I chose: "The development of Soviet science."  Someone chooses "The development of writing in the Principality of Poland", someone "Ice Battle", someone "Causes of the collapse of the USSR", etc.  After someone reads or retells the abstract, you need to ask questions about it and for each question - pluses are put, the number of which affects the receipt of credits automatically. <br>  <b>OBZH</b> : The most boring subject, but here we were lucky with the teacher.  On the topic, he speaks very rarely (only the most important thing).  Most often he tells us about how to achieve success in this life (starting from how to do exercises, ending with the need to get a second degree), advises many useful scientific or psychological books, magazines and newspapers that develop thinking and versatility.  Not a word is gold, therefore it is a pleasure to be on such an object. <br><br><h3>  Olympics </h3><br>  In general, in the first year we are not strongly recommended to participate in various competitions, as they distract from study.  And in the first year, if I missed something, then a lump of misunderstanding of the following material rolls up very quickly.  Nevertheless, the most desperate still participate, but, of course, only for their own pleasure, since there is not enough time to prepare.  The most popular competitions and contests: Imagen Cup, ACM, Campus. <br><br><h3>  Teaching Staff </h3><br>  The key point of why it is so pleasant (although difficult) to study at the VMK is the teaching staff.  Every word of the teacher is gold.  Almost all of them try to instill in us a love for mathematics, as for science, and they do it.  Although, of course, there are exceptions.  There are some lecturers who do not want to be like everyone else and give lectures in their own way without paying attention to the seminars and the semester program.  It is very difficult with such lecturers, although many do simply: do not attend their lectures. <br>  Each teacher has his own system of crediting automatic.  Someone needs to solve all the problems on the control, so that in the standings there was nothing to solve.  Someone needs 100% attendance + work in class.  Someone needs to write all the notes to get the machine.  The unified system is only for Mathematical analysis and Linear algebra: the test will be almost anyway :) Well, if you are, of course, not a genius who solved ALL tasks on + on all controls. <br><br><h3>  Help students </h3><br>  There are several programs in our faculty that can make life easier for those in need.  Here are the main ones: <br><ul><li>  <b>Payment of tickets home.</b>  Thanks to our trade union committee that she does it.  True, you can use it only once a semester. </li><li>  <b>Free issuance of persons.</b>  <b>Microsoft products.</b>  If anyone has heard, then the issuance of these products is carried out under the MSDN Academic Alliance program.  All you have to do is take the application to their laboratory and send you an e-mail account to the system where you can download all Microsoft products with license keys. </li><li>  <b>Scholarship</b> .  The first semester all students pay 2200 per month.  The scholarship in the following semesters depends on academic performance.  Excellent students are paid 2,700. For goodies are 2,200. For all the rest 1,100. Not enough, of course, but it is still nice to find thousands on your card by the end of the year. 18. </li><li> <b>Financial assistance</b> .  If a family is large or something like that, then by writing a statement, you can pay additional funds a month.  I do not know in what size, unfortunately, because I do not fall into this category. </li></ul><br><h3>  Equipment </h3><br>  Equipped faculty relatively well.  There are several main machine rooms with 120 computers.  And you can also find some audiences where computers are on the desks, but for what they are there I do not know yet, because we have not used them yet - they are for senior students. <br>  But the presence of two supercomputers is particularly gratifying: <a href="">IBM Blue Gene</a> and our Russian Chebyshev.  By the way, the performance of "Chebyshev" above Blue Gene is already several times (60 terraflops).  A new room is currently under construction for these mainframes. <br><br><h3>  Sport </h3><br>  Each freshman must choose a section where he wants to go: volleyball, basketball, handball, sambo, boxing, athletics, skiing, special groups (with health restrictions) and OFP (General physical training).  Most students go to volleyball, basketball and sambo with boxing.  But since the number of students involved in these sections is limited, after the selection, most of them are still transferred to the general physical design. <br>  Some students who do not mind free time can participate in university cups.  And these cups are pretty serious.  For example, there is the OPK Moscow State University Cup (United Trade Union Committee of Moscow State University) in football, where about 100 teams in 6 divisions play.  You can also participate in faculty cups. <br><br>  <b>Well, it seems that all aspects that came to my mind.</b>  <b>That‚Äôs how the future scientists, mathematicians and programmers are brought up in us.</b>  <b>I will be glad to answer any of your questions;)</b> <br><br>  I would be very grateful to people who write something similar about their IT-faculty - I would like to compare.  Thank. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/73279/">https://habr.com/ru/post/73279/</a></p>
