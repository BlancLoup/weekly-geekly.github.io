He wrote down all his impressions in the form of a <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/columns/0,72546-0.html">diary</a> .  It is easy to see that abstinence begins to acutely manifest itself in the second or third absence of the Internet, as with the complete rejection of nicotine or alcohol after a long period of taking these drugs. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Day one</b> .  I have an amazing day.  For more than 24 hours, no one is trying to sell me Viagra, and none of the African monarchs is asking for financial assistance.  On the train, I overheard a discussion about government spending on the education system, and Hitler was never even mentioned.  I think I can get used to it. <br><br>  <b>Day two</b> .  Today was going pretty well, until around noon I did not understand that I did not know <a href="http://www.cfhf.net/lyrics/facts.htm">all the words</a> for the song from the film ‚ÄúLife circumstances‚Äù.  For a few seconds, I looked around for a laptop until I remembered my plan.  I had to mumble something like my own composition for half a day.  It didn‚Äôt accommodate my attendants and passersby. <br><br>  <b>Third day</b> .  I woke up with a feeling of some ... itching.  He was angry and offended by the fact that he had to get out of bed and go to the window to watch the weather.  Someone somewhere, maybe, was played by the <a href="http://divx.org.ua/about/1517.html">Lady-hawk</a> figures from the Lego designer, but I will never know about it.

      <b>Fourth day</b> .  Last night I dreamed of childhood.  There was a special place where the data was stored ... that is, books.  And there were people who did not refuse to answer questions, for example, which dinosaur is stronger than all the other dinosaurs.  And all this without a modem or wireless card.  Library, for sure!  I called the local public library. <br>  ‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù I begged, ‚Äútell me, has anyone already made a robot who knows how to play scrabble?‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúJust a second,‚Äù answered the other end.  - Now we google it. <br>  ‚ÄúOh, okay,‚Äù I hung up. <br><br>  <b>Fifth day</b> .  I was so hungry for information that I even read a paper printout of the USA Today newspaper that someone had left in the room.  It is like salt water for the thirsty.  Who painted the first caricature of a man on an uninhabited island?  Was "Outcast" nominated for any "Oscar"?  How much is a fake Oscar statuette?  Are they not prohibited by law?  In which countries are laws based on the Napoleonic code?  Does ‚Äúleon‚Äù in the word ‚ÄúNapoleon‚Äù mean something related to lions?  How did people look for arguments in a dispute when there was no internet?  It‚Äôs scary to imagine how many marriages fell apart simply because the spouses couldn‚Äôt agree on how to call the Angolans: Angolians or Angolans.  Data!  I need the data! <br><br>  <b>The sixth day</b> .  ‚ÄúAll your base‚Äù.  My base?  I'm at your base, killing your dancing boy.  Badger Badger Badger Badger TUNAK TUNAK!  Software pirates against ninja-marauders.  P2P!  B2B!  USB!  Web 2.0, right?  IRC.  I am C. I am C ++.  I am a network.  I am the Internet!  Yes!  I understood!  I am the Internet!  Magic was in me all the time!  I have to let her go.  I have to share the internet with the world.  Where is the port?  WHERE PORT? <br><br>  <b>Seventh day</b> .  They said that the maid in the room found me knocking my head into a telephone jack with the sound of a ‚Äúgarbage minder trying to sing‚Äù, which I suspect was my attempt to imitate modem noise.  I was sent to the hospital, given a soothing pill and iBook, and I immediately climbed on YouTube to look for a ‚ÄúGodzilla suit.‚Äù  The doctors said that after a couple of weeks I would return to normal and prescribed a uniform diet from RSS feeds, but warned me not to repeat the offline experiment again.  I immediately ordered Treo for backup.  Online, of course. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30884/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30884/</a></p>
