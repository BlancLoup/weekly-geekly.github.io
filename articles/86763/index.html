We will acquaint habrochiteli with the most interesting events from the iron world for the week.  Now you don‚Äôt have to look for interesting news yourself, we will do it for you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7d3/a94/d63/7d3a94d6336cc0e3a0f3712e747c54a4.png" alt="mage"><br><br>  This issue is devoted to the exhibition, held in Hannover from 2 to 6 March.  It carries the proud name of CEBIT 2010. It is this exhibition that all iron producers are looking forward to in order to show their new developments.  It is there that public samples for the first time become available to the public.  A member of our team, Dmitry Rodionov, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/neoforce/" class="user_link">NeoForce</a> visited the exhibition, and we are ready to share with you news from the stands of Asus, MSI, Enermax, Scythe, and also we will present you a new NZXT building - TEMPEST EVO.

      <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/occlub/blog/85874/">Release 1</a> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/733/c51/d20/733c51d20446ae3ed5945b5e50bbd819.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <a href="">Zoom</a> <br><br>  The beginning of the exhibition was laid back in 1947, but since 1986 the exhibition has received its true face.  The largest exhibition, which has no equal, attracts thousands of journalists and just IT-lovers from around the world to Germany in the spring.  And every year, all companies are preparing a "bomb" - a product that should blow up the public with delight.  Want to know what 2010 has prepared for us, then go ahead. <br><br>  <b>MSI stand:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e6c/dfa/ac4/e6cdfaac4b5969320e14c187dbcf1d9d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <a href="">Zoom</a> <br><br>  MSI R5870 Lightning is a product that both overclockers and gamers are waiting with undisguised interest.  Still, this is the fastest single-chip card in the world.  Let's see what's so cool about her.  The line under the auspices of Lightning is an improved prototype of the reference video cards, but with its own design board.  The high frequencies of the core and memory, set by default - this is not the main surprise of the video card.  Its main purpose is to conquer world records.  It's not for nothing, MSI engineers reworked the power supply card, putting as many as fifteen power phases on the board - 13 per core and 2 for memory.  And the power of the card is not supplied through two six-pin connectors, but through two eight-pin connectors.  What should ideally add another 150 watts of consumption.  In order for all this to fit on one board, engineers had to increase its width by 10 mm, which protrude above the Twin Frozr II cooling system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/30c/1c3/d37/30c1c3d372ca58e7db5237b707cebda0.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <a href="">Zoom</a> <br><br>  MSI Big Bang X Power is a new motherboard based on Intel X58 chipset.  Not only amazing video cards are made by MSI, their Big Bang lineup is a very strong competitor for the recognized regulars of the upper price segment.  The main features of the board include a reinforced power supply circuit, 6 PCI-Express 16x expansion slots, two eight-pin power connectors for the processor (a mandatory trend awaiting the announcement of Intel Gulftown), as well as a new system for fastening RAM with a latch on one side only.  But we still will not see the most anticipated from the MSI motherboards - the Lucid HYDRA 200 chip, which can ensure the operation of two video cards from different manufacturers in the same system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/29d/609/465/29d609465f6a3a05240af785363970b5.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <a href="">Zoom</a> <br><br>  MSI 870A-GD60-Hydra is the first MSI motherboard for AMD processors using Lucid HYDRA chip.  The feature of the AMD 870 chipset is such that it can provide only one line of PCI-Express 16x, which means that systems on the SLI and CrossFire tandems are impossible.  The problem is solved with the help of the Hydra chip, which provides two PCI-Express 16x lanes, and also has the ability to work the tandem with different video cards. <br><br>  <b>Stand Enermax:</b> <br><br><img src="http://img715.imageshack.us/img715/3096/38a4b6c21138.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <a href="">Zoom</a> <br><br>  Enermax presented at its booth new fashion trends in the field of power supplies, fans and enclosures.  The work of designers on Enermax products has never caused even a little doubt in their skill.  The company's designers also approached their booth at CeBIT 2010 with original ideas.  Booth visitors were greeted by a red-eyed robot laid out of Enermax Apollish Vegas fans. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/937/c98/5fe/937c985fe18db87c5b20644ebcce4595.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <a href="">Zoom</a> <br><br>  The power supply unit Enermax 800 W Modu87 + differs from competitors by high efficiency - 87%, not for nothing that this line of blocks is certified 80 Gold Plus.  In addition to high performance, the unit has an excellent appearance; it is even a pity to tuck such a unit into the case.  Well, as you know, the silence of the block is the key to success.  The built-in fan at idle rotates only 330 revolutions per minute. <br><br>  <b>Asus stand:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b36/a05/b70/b36a05b7086bab5a7f9ca3b975d4c95e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <a href="">Zoom</a> <br><br>  Asus introduced the new Asus Crosshair IV Formula game board.  The novelty is based on AMD's new chipset from the 890FX chipset.  The company's red-and-black colors of the board and the cooling system immediately make it clear about the focus of this board in the Republic of Gamers solutions segment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/20f/a53/fcd/20fa53fcdd9281bcd6e8f8e3df51972a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <a href="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/20f/a53/fcd/20fa53fcdd9281bcd6e8f8e3df51972a.jpg/">Zoom</a> <br><br>  Oddly enough, Asus presented at its booth the full power of its motherboards with the help of overclockers.  The German team Award Fabrik in the face of the famous overclockers stummerwinter and NoName showed the maximum capacity that can be squeezed out of Asus motherboards using liquid nitrogen.  (To be honest, the choice of Asus as a stand for overclockers surprised me because the Russian office flatly refuses to work with overclockers, directing all forces to promote notebooks. It became interesting in Taiwan they know about this state of affairs in Russia) <br><br>  <b>Scythe booth:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/30a/9a2/ea1/30a9a2ea158b9f108aa2eb00f0002bf8.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <a href="">Zoom</a> <br><br>  Scythe Susano is the name of the new brainchild of Scythe.  The cooler, whose dimensions go beyond the usual, was created for a hi-end system. It is capable of cooling even the hottest CPU.  The combination of six copper heat pipes, made in the original form of the radiator, is cooled with the help of four 120 mm fans.  Someone still doubts that he will not cope with the cooling?  But here its dimensions, for sure, will cause doubts among users.  After all, such a hulk does not fit into every body.  But even the body we will advise you. <br><br>  <b>NZXT Tempest Evo</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/112/488/1c3/1124881c38bf5604e041887f06f188ee.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <a href="">Zoom</a> <br><br>  Russian distributors for sale appeared NZXT Tempest Evo - the successor of the ‚ÄúKing of air currents‚Äù.  His father - it was already something: a housing that was really blown through the entire volume with a mad number of fans (according to the manufacturer, quiet and efficient).  But there was something to modify.  And here she is, brought to mind the model!  Finished really good.  We were most attracted by the internal painting, the appearance of a window in the mounting plate for removing the cooler without dismantling the motherboard, a modified back panel with perforated slots plugs and as many as four holes for the thick hoses of SVO and tricky branded fans with nine saber blades!  Maniacs performance - the body for you! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/689/0b5/544/6890b5544589ef4681ef340ed876cbfc.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <a href="">Zoom</a> <br><br>  By the way, the previous hit NZXT, about which we wrote earlier ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/81973/">Shock to the body: how much logic is there in modern computer cases?</a> ), Was noticed <a href="http://www.arigus.ru/publications/news/1662.html%3FSID%3D64fc04e9b8292506d8656ffc508e6f8a">here</a> . <br>  Most likely, NZXT Tempest Evo will be the first to appear here. <br><br><img src="http://img412.imageshack.us/img412/5659/487t.jpg" alt="image">  <a href="">Zoom</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86763/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86763/</a></p>
