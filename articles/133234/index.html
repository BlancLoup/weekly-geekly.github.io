      In our country, at that, both in its real spaces and in virtual ones, the preparation for the elections began in full swing in September-October.  The start of the election campaigns, debates and scandals, violations of electoral legislation, loud revelations and <a href="http://www.securelist.com/ru/analysis/208050724/Spam_v_oktyabre_2011_goda">political spam mailings</a> took place just in the first half of autumn. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  To the last point of the program, we, of course, were ready and expected that spam with political slogans was about to start falling into our networks.  This was expected, because in the run-up to the elections, we each time fixed mailings campaigning for one of the parties or candidates.  Usually, it is difficult to understand on such mailings, PR is black PR or, conversely, because, on the one hand, it‚Äôs like advertisements, and on the other hand, which sane candidate decides to unwind himself in the tired spam electorate? <br><br>  This year such mailings in spam flows are practically absent.  Spamming has become more popular, campaigning not ‚Äúfor‚Äù the party, but ‚Äúagainst‚Äù.  "Against" the party in power, or "against" the election as a whole. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="http://www.securelist.com/ru/images/vlill/spamreport_oct2011_pic04s.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  In October there were especially many political spam messages, although it must be assumed that in November there will not be less of them.  The main feature of political spam in recent months is that spam has become a very unique platform for slogans of a very extremist nature.  Spammers are calling for sabotage, destroying the gas and oil pipelines, making revolutions and overthrowing power.  The prevalence of such slogans in spam is quite easy to explain.  It is clear that the Internet gives only partial anonymity.  To arrange a rostrum for appeals to the revolution and sabotage, say, from the cozy zhezhechka, is fraught with the fact that the saboteur will be found and attracted.  Creating a one-day blog under an unreadable login for a single record is not a tactic either - firstly, this underbid will still need to be unwound somehow, and secondly, the likelihood that it will be hidden for bot-likeness is nearing 100 percent. <br><br>  Whether it's spam!  Anonymously, with the help of a botnet (that is, using the PCs of those most unfortunate voters whom the revolutionary is trying to win over), he sent out several thousand messages, paying for them to a person about whom you know nothing but the nickname.  Something will be cut, of course, anti-spam.  But after all, not everyone has it - <a href="http://www.kaspersky.ru/anti-spam">anti-spam</a> .  Or maybe someone regularly goes to the folder with junk mail and reads its contents?  But you never know!  In short, cheap, angry and much safer than from a semi-anonymous blog.  In general, they found each other - hated by all spam and hating all extremists. <br><br>  It is not clear why normal slogans and projects spread through such a controversial channel.  Some spammers manage to explain in their messages that they have not found a better way to spread information.  Immediately the question arises: how not found?  In today's realities, blogs are becoming one of the main sources of information, and mail is gradually dying off and is used for subscription to social networks and business correspondence.  And in these conditions there was no better way to disseminate information, which itself does not violate any laws?  Any community of the relevant topics will be happy to accept a new interesting project, or a good idea and distribute it among interested parties.  And spam is bad.  And soon, we hope, even in Russia, anti-spam laws will start to work. <br><br>  The October spam was marked not only by political newsletters.  Many of the events that occurred, or the future were reflected in it.  What exactly interested spammers and the statistical review of the October spam stream in runet can be found <a href="http://www.securelist.com/ru/analysis/208050724/Spam_v_oktyabre_2011_goda">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133234/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133234/</a></p>
