  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New CERN data analysis - ‚ÄúPerhaps not the Higgs boson‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://dvice.com/assets_c/2012/07/Atlas_HiggsSimulation-(1)-thumb-550xauto-95530.jpg" alt="image"><br>  When CERN representatives announced the discovery of a new particle last week, they were very careful, not to mention the discovery of the Higgs boson.  Instead, it was said about ‚Äúobtaining convincing evidence‚Äù of the existence of a ‚Äúparticle very similar to the Higgs boson‚Äù.  A new analysis of data obtained by physicists when working with the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), performed by a group of outside scientists, sheds light on such uncertainty of CERN physicists, according to this analysis with a large percentage of probability in the CERN data some exotic imposting particle, not the Higgs boson . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Unfortunately, in the depths of the Large Hadron Collider, not a single exotic particle exists long enough for scientists to register it directly and study its properties.  Instead, LHC sensors detect the so-called attenuation of a particle, the sequence of decay of this particle into other particles, the further decay of secondary particles, and so on along the chain.  In most cases, scientists manage to register only the most finite attenuation links and there are a sufficient number of different particles, the attenuation of which ends in a very similar way.  Therefore, it is required to conduct the same experiment, operating with something completely new, quite a large number of times in order for the results to become reliable from a statistical point of view and these results can be distinguished from a combination of already known things. <br><br>  The discovery of CERN, which was announced last week, was the discovery of a new particle in the "correct" mass range.  This particle may well be the Higgs boson; however, further analysis of the collected data, carried out by physicists from the Argon National Laboratory, suggests with a high degree of certainty that instead of the Higgs boson itself, its more exotic variant, called the Higgs triplet, was discovered.  These imposting particles are part of a non-Standard Model interpreting the concept of Higgs, which allows for the existence of a number of similar particles in the Higgs region instead of a single particle followed by CERN physicists with such persistence. <br><br>  Based on data provided by CERN physicists for independent verification, researchers from Argon found that the obtained level of statistical accuracy of the results, which CERN considered to be evidence of the Higgs boson itself, could be obtained if, instead of the Higgs boson, duplicates split in the collider and Higgs triplets.  It is necessary to recognize, scientists say, that the Higgs boson from the Standard Model more fully fits the results, but one of the statistical deviations, just one, but significant, highlights the Higgs triplet impostor.

      Of course, there remains a certain probability, albeit a small one, but it still remains that CERN scientists discovered the real Higgs boson in the form in which it is described by the Standard Model of particle physics.  Therefore, in order to put an end point in this epic, scientists will have to do quite a lot of work and collect additional evidence that can easily turn into a refutation. <br><br>  Original source: <a href="http://dvice.com/archives/2012/07/cern-may-have-d.php">dvice.com/archives/2012/07/cern-may-have-d.php</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147588/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147588/</a></p>
