At the earliest pores I got Twitter and Instagram: I even have a username - <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/gregory/" class="user_link">gregory</a> in both networks.  I laughed at those who could not "understand" these services.

      And then came Snapchat.  I downloaded it, but none of my friends were there, so it was impossible to appreciate its appeal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/cd5/c7b/9cb/cd5c7b9cb2f60a1635cec17261a83262.png" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Many people learn new social networks more slowly with age, but the company Sawhorse Media, which I founded, launched The Shorty Awards for the best in social media, and Muck Rack - SaaS is a solution for PR and journalism based on social networks.  Our job is to understand the latest trends in social media, but many of us still have not understood Snapchat. <br><br>  If we recall the spread of Twitter, it becomes clear that people cannot understand it until they start talking in it.  Before that, people just say: ‚ÄúWhat can be said about valuable things in 140 characters?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúWhy not use a blog for this?‚Äù Total immersion on Twitter is the only way to really understand it.  How could we make everyone in our company understand Snapchat? <br><br>  And then something hit me in the head: we decided to announce one day in the company as a day's Snapchat.  On this business day, all forms of internal communication, including email, IM, chat, SMS, comments to Trello, bug reports on Github, and even phone calls were banned.  All communication has moved to Snapchat. <br><br>  The day Snapchat began tough.  Obviously, Snapchat has not been developed as an effective tool for business communication, and it is not.  In the middle of the day we were all pretty well mastered sending messages using the platform and the basics of its non-intuitive interface.  How do you report a bug via Snapchat?  Just send a photo: <br><br>  Even accepting orders for the dinner team, which we usually did together through Seamless, became a problem: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/685/4de/1bc/6854de1bcc0e4dd4b2605530109b899b.png" height="500"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a46/c86/776/a46c86776c664a2486b979f5c8ce22cc.png" height="500"><br><br>  The youngest of us became mentors for the rest, by the rest I mean everyone over 25. They showed us how to change the font size and color, add filters, and create Snapchat stories.  By the end of the day we were almost professionals, and some now use it forever. <br><br>  The day Snapchat has destroyed several of my prejudices against the platform.  She was usually described as a network for sending provocative photos, and her users seemed irresponsible and naive because they believed that they would not be recorded or caught.  In reality, most of what appears on Snapchat is regular content (i.e., food photos, stupid selfies) that won't get on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter. <br><br>  Compared to the social network, where by default the content is available to everyone forever, Snapchat is much more responsible. <br><br>  I know people who have become professional video story tellers in Snapchat Stories, they allow users to post a set of photos or videos for any friends for a period of 24 hours.  I would not be surprised if some future filmmaker admits that everything began as a child with Snapchat Stories, just as directors now begin with home video cameras. <br><br>  If you see that you and your team misunderstand any new social network or new technology, do not read about its work - just dive into it with your head. <br><br>  A media company that has not yet mastered Twitter should spend a day on Twitter: you can chat through answers (if the information is not private) and DM is for private data. <br><br>  The American company, aimed at the markets of Japan and Indonesia, can spend the day Line (this messenger is incredibly popular in these countries). <br><br>  A company that wants to make its application on Apple Watch can set itself the task to go through the day when everyone only communicates through Apple Watch and the corresponding applications on the iPhone. <br><br>  The best way to learn technology is to use it.  You will be surprised how much you can understand per day. <br><br>  <i>ChaTeam is a Russian instant messenger that focuses on thematic communication.</i>  <i>We hope that our ideology will allow including companies to more actively communicate with their customers, offer them help and communication on all issues.</i>  <i>While you can subscribe to <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/chateam/">our blog on Megamose</a> , already try the beta version of our <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Devyton.chateam%26utm_source%3Dmegamozg.ru">application for Android</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/chateam/id947384514">iOS</a> , subscribe to our groups <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/ChaTeam/1588297424785722">on Facebook</a> and <a href="https://vk.com/chateam">VKontakte</a> to discuss the latest news.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292852/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292852/</a></p>
