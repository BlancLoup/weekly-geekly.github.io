      It's a little different here.  But it would seem that in this bad? <br>  I wrote a library or application, flooded it with a githab and great. <br>  And it's really great if this is a simple library with a couple of bugs and hundreds of users. <br>  Once a month I wrote to issues, once a year I updated the version - everyone is happy. <br><br>  And if the project is complex and even became popular?  Here everything is bad. <br><br>  Who does not know me - I am the author of the open source project <a href="https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq">GitLab</a> . <br>  In fact, this is a web application for hosting git-repositories inside a closed infrastructure. <br>  For information, you can read <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/165759/">this post</a> . <br>  It is in the Popular Starred Repositories github on the first page so it‚Äôs an example for this. <br><br>  So given: <br>  Project: GitLab <br>  Number of githubs per day: 30-40 <br>  Installations: 40k + <br><br>  <b>1. Time</b> <br><br>  Time is a resource extremely limited in the life of the developer. <br>  What is your open source project in terms of your time? <br>  * This is a time to read the wishes, bug reports <br>  * this is the time to develop and maintain the code <br>  * This is the time to review pull ricks or patches <br>  * This is the time for revision and fixes after these patches. <br>  * this is the time for discussion and support <br><br>  Total you are sitting at 11 pm for a laptop at home and your wife looks at you angrily <br><br>  <b>2. Fun</b> <br><br>  Great feeling to write an open source project.  You choose the technologies that suit you, write without haste, beautifully and gracefully.  You give this world a project of high quality and openness. <br>  Then people start using your project.  You are excited and surely your pride is dancing with delight. <br><br>  And then there are bugs - you need to fix it.  The more people the more feedback and certainly more bugs. <br>  Fixing bugs is not so fun.  Especially if they are difficult to reproducible or require ugly solutions from you. <br>  This is far from fun. <br><br>  You receive a large number of letters.  To rake a bug report and to manage the issue tracker this is sad. <br>  Patches come.  Review is cool when you send good code.  Or an interesting solution.  But often it will be so-so.  Or very bad.  And then code review is longing. <br><br>  Support for an open source project is not fun.  It's hard and boring <br><br>  <b>3. Pull Requests or Patches</b> <br><br>  Everyone loves open source for community input.  I can definitely say that a definite plus. <br>  It would seem good when people send you pull ricksta. <br><br>  But pull ricksta: <br>  * often bad.  And not always because the developer is bad.  He just might not completely figure out your project. <br>  * there are <a href="https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlab-recipes/pull/54">such</a> <br>  * require review, testing and still end up missing something.  And then correct and swear. <br>  * eat your time <br>  * This is the code that you will then have to support. <br><br>  As a result, you do not even want to open a tab with Pull Requests. <br><br>  <b>4. Community</b> <br><br>  We love open source because it's a community of developers like us. <br>  You can divide the community into adequate people and not very much. <br>  And the latter will have to deal more often. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMake me this feature.  Otherwise I will use another project. ‚Äù <br>  "Without this functionality, this project is useless" <br>  ‚ÄúYou do everything wrong.  Give us the project otherwise you'll ruin it. ‚Äù <br>  "Your code sucks, we will write everything much better" <br>  ‚ÄúI did not do everything according to the instructions.  Why does nothing work for me?  I hate you" <br>  "You must...." <br>  "I demand...." <br><br>  And you are sitting like that - ‚Äúwtf?‚Äù <br>  It seems to be doing a good job, but here you owe someone already. <br><br>  Total this turns into a job.  But for which you do not pay. <br><br>  Therefore, when you meet a bug or govnokod in an open source project - treat the authors with politeness and understanding. <br>  They are already suffering. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/169339/">https://habr.com/ru/post/169339/</a></p>
