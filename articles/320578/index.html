  <section class="page js-page"><h1>PgConf.Russia 2017 - we invite you to the March conference in Moscow</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  In March, the third international conference PgConf.Russia will be held in Moscow for the third time.  For the first time, the conference gathered about 460 participants, in the second - about 600, at those times it was a world record for events dedicated to PostgreSQL, which, along with the high information richness of the program, confirms the tremendous interest in this DBMS in Russia. <a name="habracut"></a>  Presentations and videos of reports of past conferences are available at <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2016">https://pgconf.ru/2016</a> and <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2015">https://pgconf.ru/2015</a> . </p><br><p>  Traditionally, the first day of the conference, March 15, is dedicated to master classes, and the next two days, March 16 and 17, to reports.  Reports will go in three streams, and will begin immediately after a short opening.  At the very end of the conference, the participants will come together again in a session of blitz reports. </p><br><p>  The conference will be held at the Digital October site in the center of Moscow. </p><br><h2>  Differences from the previous conference </h2><br><p>  The first PgConf.Russia took place two years ago.  And now we see radical changes, many interesting projects have been implemented at Postgres in Russia, many projects are still being developed, the Russian community has become more mature and more active, including in terms of submitting reports to the conference.  Therefore, the conference has become more specific, more technical, more Russian.  The time when it was necessary to promote Postgres in Russia, has passed, the time has come for this work.  Therefore, the new conference will have more practical reports from the ‚Äúfields‚Äù, and less rhetoric. </p><br><h2>  Workshops (March 15) </h2><br><p>  It is recommended to come to the master class with your own laptop.  In this case, you can try everything that the speakers show.  As a rule, they will offer for downloading some materials, or images of virtual machines, containing the environment ready for the exercises of the master class. </p><br><p>  The master classes program includes the following topics: </p><br><br><ul><li>  D. Vasiliev.  <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/93746">Mamonsu is a Swiss knife for controlling and monitoring PostgreSQL</a> . </li><li>  I. Panchenko.  <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/93658">JSON, JSONB, JSQuery</a> . </li><li>  F. Sigaev, A. Zakirov.  <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/94083">Full-text search capabilities</a> in PostgreSQL. </li><li>  A. Hernandez.  <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/93843">Java programming for PostgreSQL</a> . </li><li>  D. Lebedev.  <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/94053">Explore geodata using PostGIS and related tools</a> . </li><li>  E. Horn.  ProBackup: fast, reliable, incremental. </li><li>  P. Luzanov.  Overview of tools for debugging, profiling and tracing server code. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Reports (March 16 and 17) </h2><br><p>  A list of accepted reports can be viewed on the conference website at <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017">https://pgconf.ru/2017</a> .  Here we will give a brief overview of the main topics covered by the reports already adopted. </p><br><p>  <b>The architecture of complex and high-performance systems</b> is always a topical issue.  Let's start with her. </p><br><p>  As you know, the Skype platform is built mainly on PostgreSQL, has been working on it for many years and serves more than 2 billion subscribers.  The total number of transactions per second reaches hundreds of thousands.  Skype Alexey Plotnikov will talk about the architecture and experience <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/93818">of using Skype databases</a> .  There will be another report from Skype - Radoslav Glinsky, about how a <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/94018">test environment is</a> organized in Skype and how its adequacy to the production environment is ensured. </p><br><p>  <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/92899">Vladimir Borodin</a> will make a report on how Yandex addresses the issue of maintaining tens of thousands of connections to a single database.  Yandex Mail <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/top/2016-09-15_yandeks_otkazalsya_ot_subd_oracle_v_svoem_pochtovom">completed the transition to Postgres</a> last year.  The daily audience of this service exceeds 10 million people, the daily number of incoming letters is more than 150 million. </p><br><p>  Christopher Travers will talk about his experience with <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/94032">dozens of terabytes of databases in science</a> , and Dmitry Beloborodov from UIS, CoMagic about how the company went <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/93999">from a couple of gigabytes to multi-terabyte databases</a> , and what technological and organizational practices have been gained. </p><br><p>  The <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/93499">Vadim Yatsenko</a> report from Progress Soft focuses on how the system was created, the data volume of which grows by more than 1 billion records per day, which technical solutions made it possible to save a lot on the amount of stored data, how design errors were eliminated and new versions of Postgres helped solve these problems.

    </p><p>  Alexey Lesovsky, a renowned PostgreSQL maintenance expert, will talk about troubleshooting <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/92876">issues with streaming replication operations</a> .  Ilya Kosmodemyansky will present a report on the <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/94128">interaction of the DBMS with the</a> Linux <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/94128">I / O subsystem</a> on how to achieve maximum performance when reading and writing data. <br><br></p><p>  Dmitry Vasiliev, the author of <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/93746">mamonsu</a> , Dmitry Vagin from <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/93664">AVITO</a> and <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/93804">Nikolay Sivko</a> from Okmeter will tell about various aspects of the monitoring implementation. </p><br><p>  <b>PostgreSQL and 1C</b> .  An important topic, as many organizations using the 1C platform, consider the transition from Microsoft SQL Server to PostgreSQL, but this transition is often hampered by a lack of information.  Therefore, on PgConf.Russia a separate section will be devoted to topics 1C.  The report section from the Postgres Professional company will open, in which it will be told how the new Postgres developments can improve 1C performance.  Then <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/93686">Anton Doroshkevich</a> from Infosoft and <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/92773">Dmitry Yukhtimovsky</a> from gilev.ru, leading companies solving the most difficult tasks of operating 1C, will perform.  Their reports will be devoted to practical experience with large databases.  We also expect a report from the company 1C. </p><br><p>  <b>Clusters, distributed processing and fault tolerance.</b>  The topic will be opened by a review report by Stas Kelvich, who will also talk about the current status of Multimaster with support for distributed transactions and fault tolerance.  Ildar Musin will talk about the current <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/93984">partitioning</a> status of <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/93984">tables</a> in Postgres, the pg_pathman extension, and distributed partitioning using FDW.  Ivan Frolkov will tell about the new feature - <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/93420">alienable (portable) tables</a> , which allow to solve many administrative tasks and improve the performance of a number of operations.  A report on working with BDR under load is also expected. </p><br><p>  Practical organization of fault-tolerant configurations will be devoted to the reports of Mikhail Kulagin from Postgres Professional and <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/93520">Alexander Kukushkin</a> from Zalando.  Demonstration of failover clusters and Multimaster can be viewed and discussed at the Postgres Professional booth. </p><br><p>  <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/93617">Marco Slot</a> will talk about how Citus DB aims for a million records per second, <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/92882">and Dave Cramer</a> from Pivotal will talk about the architecture and practical side of Greenplum. </p><br>  <b>Climbing Elbrus</b> <br><p>  A pleasant surprise will be the story of the Voskhod team and the MCST on how and why to launch <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/93795">Postgres on Elbrus</a> .  As is known, this team is engaged in the creation of a state system for registering passport and visa documents.  Also, the speakers will address issues of fault tolerance and increase the reliability of data storage. </p><br>  <b>New in PostgreSQL</b> <br><p>  As you know, the Postgres Pro team develops RUM, an advanced version of GIN indices that allows you to speed up full-text search.  Oleg Bartunov‚Äôs report ‚ÄúRUM-indices and their application‚Äù will tell about him.  Marcus Nullmeier of the University of Heidelberg will talk about his development of RUM ideas and his developments that <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/93602">improve RUM</a> and add data compression in the index.  The topic of index extensibility is also covered in the report by <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/92737">Andrei Borodin</a> from Oktonika. </p><br><p>  The theme of the <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/93623">JIT compilation of SQL queries</a> will be revealed by Dmitry Melnik from the ISP RAS team.  This is a very popular development direction for PostgreSQL now, which allows you to increase the performance of complex queries by about an order of magnitude, and sometimes more.  The ISP RAS team has advanced further in this direction. </p><br><p>  Mikhail Shurutov from Postgres Professional will talk about various ways to implement <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/93537">offline transactions</a> . </p><br><p>  Oleg Ivanov from Moscow State University will present his extension for Postgres 9.6, which implements the optimization of queries to the DBMS using <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/93634">machine learning technologies</a> . </p><br><p>  <b>Semi-structured data</b> and capabilities for working with them is one of the well-known advantages of Postgres.  <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/93840">Alvaro Hernandez</a> , the developer of ToroDB, will talk about the transparent migration of data from MongoDB to Postgres. </p><br><p>  Alexander Alekseev from Postgres Professional will talk about the ZSON extension developed by him for <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/93450">vocabulary JSON compression</a> .  Roland Zonnenshain's report will focus on using <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/93625">JSON (B) in production management</a> . </p><br><p>  The reports by <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/92903">Andrey Fefelov</a> and <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/93476">Sergey Mirvoda</a> will discuss the use of Postgres in BI systems, and the report of Maxim Viharev on the use of <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/93897">Postgres in the Alytics contextual advertising system</a> .  The theme of PostGIS will be devoted not only to <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/94053">Dmitry Lebedev's</a> master class, but also to the presentation by Dorofey Prolesovsky ‚Äú <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2017/93779">Moving Goals in PostGIS</a> ‚Äù. </p><br><p>  These are not all reports, but only a part, and the full list can be seen on the conference website. </p><br><p>  The conference is international in its mood; last year‚Äôs success made a big impression on the community, and many famous people accepted the invitation or expressed their desire to speak at PgConf.Russia, despite the language barrier (as a rule, international conferences are held in English, at PgConf. Russia is the working language of Russian, and professional double-sided simultaneous translation will work in all halls). </p><br><br><p>  The conference is not only reports, but also communication.  Therefore, this year PgConf.Russia will host 2 round tables: ‚ÄúProblems of import substitution and transition to domestic or free software‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Future of IT Education‚Äù, and the living room of developers, where you can ask questions to Russian and foreign developers Postgres, and discuss with they are any problems. </p><br><br><p>  <b>What to do if you do not have time to submit a report?</b>  As you can see on the site, the form of receiving reports continues to operate.  We have left several backup slots for which several more reports compete.  If you offer something interesting, it will definitely be considered.  In addition, there is an opportunity to speak at the session of five-minute blitz reports, which will be recorded directly at the conference.  If you want to speak at the round table, write about it at <a href="">info@pgconf.ru</a> .  At the same address, the organizing committee will answer any questions about the conference. </p><br>
<h2>  How to get involved? </h2><br><p>  To participate in the conference you need to register on the site <a href="https://pgconf.ru/">https://pgconf.ru/</a> .  Participation can be paid by card on the site or request an invoice for payment through the bank. </p><br><br><h2>  Other PostgreSQL World Community Events </h2><br><p>  Conferences like ours are held in the world, each of them has its own specifics.  For developers of the database engine, the main one is <a href="https://www.pgcon.org/">PgCon</a> , traditionally held in Ottawa.  There are several annual conferences for users in the United States, the largest are <a href="http://pgconf.us/">PgConf.US</a> in New York and <a href="http://www.pgconfsv.com/">PgConf.Silcon Valley</a> in San Francisco.  In Europe, <a href="http://pgconf.eu/">PgConf.EU</a> takes place each year in the <a href="http://pgconf.eu/">fall</a> , and in Asia - <a href="http://www.pgconf.asia/EN/">PgConf.Asia</a> and <a href="http://pgday.asia/">PgDay.Asia</a> .  There are two large conferences in Russia - Moscow <a href="https://pgconf.ru/">PgConf.Russia</a> and St. Petersburg <a href="http://pgday.ru/">PgDay</a> .  At <a href="http://www.highload.ru/">HighLoad</a> ++ and regional IT conferences on postgres, there are also usually several reports.  Postgres Professional conducts free seminars and training courses in various cities of Russia, including  the next <a href="https://pgconf.ru/201701/">January bouquet</a> seminar at Peterservis office in St. Petersburg.  Further plans have not yet been published, but this year it is planned to hold several small events in the Black Earth, Volga region, in the South and beyond the Urals.  The <a href="https://www.meetup.com/postgresqlrussia/">RuPostgres</a> Russian <a href="https://www.meetup.com/postgresqlrussia/">mitap group</a> often organizes small but dynamic events.  The nearest of them in Moscow will be devoted to full-text search in PostgreSQL. </p><p></p><p></p></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/320578/">https://habr.com/ru/post/320578/</a></p>
