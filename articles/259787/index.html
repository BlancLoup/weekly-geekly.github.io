  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"TM" restarts "My Circle"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The company TM has become the new owner of the My Circle service.  Yandex, the former owner of the service, and TM, the publisher of projects for IT specialists, offer users a <a href="https://moikrug.ru/">look</a> at the updated version of the service. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/tm/blog/259787/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ff/db8/a3f/3ffdb8a3f476463c93b0980fd3c79966.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#9cc2ce">How did it happen</font> </h2><br>  TM develops <a href="http://brainstorage.me/">Brainstorage.me</a> , a professional network of professionals working in the information technology industry.  This service stood out from Habra several years ago and is now actively developing, helping professionals to find interesting work, and for companies to strengthen the team. <br><br>  In order to make the service even more attractive, we took courage and offered Yandex to combine Brainstorage with My Circle, another project popular with IT people.  After spending many months in negotiations, we finally found a common language and agreed.

The primary role was played by personal connections and the ability to make new acquaintances with friends.  The user of the service primarily monitored the career changes of his friends, as well as the vacancies that they posted. <br><br>  In the new ‚ÄúMy Circle‚Äù we left the concept of a social network, bringing to the fore the opportunity for unfamiliar employers and job seekers to find each other.  At the same time, we have narrowed the subject of the resource, limiting it only to the IT industry, which includes such areas as: programming, layout, design, management, web analytics, marketing and others. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c7/6d8/25a/7c76d825a93149ec8a620207f261e23c.png"><br><br>  We have preserved some elements of the social network, such as friendship, feedback about each other and others, but time will tell whether we will develop in this direction and bring personal connections to the forefront, as it was before. <br><br>  If earlier placement of vacancies was free, now it has become paid.  All vacancies that were previously posted on the old ‚ÄúMy Circle‚Äù were transferred to the new service, and all of them were paid accommodation for one month. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#9cc2ce">How does the updated service</font> </h2><br>  With the help of ‚ÄúMy Circle,‚Äù employers find themselves specialists, and job seekers find work in various areas of the IT industry. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/98d/91d/b90/98d91db90464422e9568a5bf7823cddb.png"><br><br>  Employers post vacancies of their companies, receive feedback from interested applicants and select those who seem to them the most suitable.  Now it is important for employers to carefully fill out the profiles of their companies in order to tell about the company itself and about the working conditions in it to potential unfamiliar candidates. <br><br>  Applicants are looking for interesting vacancies, respond to them and receive an invitation to cooperate with employers who posted these vacancies.  Now it is much more important for job seekers to carefully fill out their profile in order to tell about their specialization and professional skills, acquired experience and achievements to unfamiliar employers. <br><br>  For more details on how the service works: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://moikrug.ru/info/help_hr">For employers</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://moikrug.ru/info/help_user">For job seekers</a> </li></ul><br><h2>  <font color="#9cc2ce">What will happen to Brainstorage.me?</font> </h2><br>  At the time of testing the new version of ‚ÄúMy Circle‚Äù, the Brainstorage service will work without any changes.  As before, vacancies from the service will be announced on all TM projects, and the link to the project will be available in the website header.  Upon completion of testing, the service will be merged with My Circle. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#9cc2ce">Period of beta testing service</font> </h2><br>  The updated "My Circle" is in beta testing.  To try it, you must accept the user agreement and update your personal data. <br><br>  We completely rewrote the service engine and adjust the system operation.  Therefore, about errors and other oddities, please report in the <a href="https://moikrug.ru/feedback">feedback form</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/259787/">https://habr.com/ru/post/259787/</a></p>
