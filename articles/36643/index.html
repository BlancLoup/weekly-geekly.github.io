The karmograph now displays additional info on hover) </li><li>  The habracut text is now written in parentheses </li><li>  Block Show topics in your blogs.  A kind of filter that eliminates either drafts or topics for friends - by default, shows all topics. </li><li>  Elements and structure have become ‚Äúmicroformatted" (who needs it, he will understand) </li><li>  Habr coding - utf-8 </li></ul><br>  <b>Editor</b> <br><ul><li>  Appearance and functionality of the topic editor </li><li>  Autosave appeared in the editor </li><li>  In the editor works automatic <b>"</b> typography <b>"</b> - a good thing ... </li><li>  New HTML tag help (opens directly "in place") </li><li>  Habr has finally ceased to distort the "script" in the links </li><li>  65000 characters in the personal profile editor (previously 3000) </li><li>  More Digestible Video Tag - </li><li>  Revision of the editor - especially the increase in buttons for beginners to publish and the disappearance of the save button in favor of autosave. </li><li>  The parser, on the whole, has become more accurate </li></ul><br>  <b>Blogs and Topics</b> <br><ul><li>  There are " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/corporative/">Corporate</a> " blogs (as long as it is empty, or rather not quite;) </li><li>  You can create fully closed topics for a certain circle of people by sending a message by internal mail to all these people. </li><li>  Links to topics have changed, now they are without html (although the old way is still working, redirecting to a new one) </li></ul><br>  <b>Ratings</b> <br><ul><li>  Karma (or habrasila?) Has become much stronger influence on the estimates of someone else's karma </li><li>  Also, the user's power now affects the assessment of comments (adding several advantages at once) </li><li>  The number of ‚Äúcartridges‚Äù (and now ‚Äúbombs‚Äù) has also greatly increased, and now it does not rest on the karma-ceiling, the calculation goes differently.  Cartridges for comments now more than karma </li><li>  to vote for topics cartridges are required </li><li>  an opportunity to abstain in voting (in the poll) </li><li>  The rollback of the ‚Äúkarma-poleovali‚Äù has obviously lessened, now you can raise karma without delay, you can try on <a href="http://nooze.habrahabr.ru/">me</a> ;) </li><li>  People with low karma, when voting, have almost no effect on the rating </li></ul><br>  <b>Users and Profiles</b> <br><ul><li>  Now, when editing personal data, information does not need to be thrown all in one pile. <br>  Now you can specify the address of the user's site, contacts in various IM-services, including Flickr, Del.isio.us and even your favorite Twitter </li><li>  There also appeared a separate line denoting the interests of the user, which after the addition turn into links, respectively, it is easy to find people with common interests </li><li>  Avatar size increased to 10 MB, before 1-2 MB </li><li>  Missing archive of vacancies </li><li>  In habraposhta can write to multiple recipients </li></ul><br><br><h4>  <b>Bugs</b> </h4><br>  <b>Interface</b> <br><ul><li>  Problems with listening to podcasts (?) </li><li>  After closing the help for html tags, there remains an ‚Äúempty place‚Äù where it used to be (Opera 9.5) </li><li>  The problem with declination in the topics with a vote.  "Voted 5 people, abstained 14 people" </li><li>  In " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/top/people/">people</a> " problems with the display of friends from some users </li><li>  The Allowed html tags help does not contain code, b, i tags. </li><li>  In the top and in the search for recent topics are displayed as invaluable, even if I already voted for them.  And it‚Äôs impossible to vote from the search page (the error crashes, not all the necessary js-files are connected). </li><li>  Lost icons in the user's block (bomb-fish-airship, etc.), etc. </li><li>  When you insert something big in the topic (graphics), the side informer and the tag cloud move down under the "write" button </li><li>  The labels of ‚Äúhappy habrechelovekov‚Äù disappeared </li><li>  If you have not logged in, the results of the voting are not shown, you cannot vote, it‚Äôs true, too - you just have to remain blissfully unaware </li><li>  When voting for karma, the Ajax rounds it to a whole number, although if you update, you can see that karma with decimal </li><li>  Unregistered user when trying to view a resume falls on error 404 </li><li>  "Habra's voice" does not work :) there 404 </li><li>  If the date of birth indicates only the month and year, before it was displayed - ‚ÄúJuly 1986‚Äù, for example.  And now - ‚ÄúJuly 00, 1986‚Äù. </li><li>  Ctrl-arrow left / right used to work to switch pages, but now they don‚Äôt work. </li></ul><br>  <b>Editor / parser</b> <br><ul><li>  Picture loader does not work (it does not exist at all).  Everything only through the img tag </li><li>  Video insertion may not work. </li><li>  The strikeout tag doesn't work - it just does nothing </li><li>  Habr, still, eats chunks of comments </li><li>  There is no tag editor when writing a comment, although the tags themselves work </li><li>  Problems with displaying the "hh" tag (habrauzer) </li><li>  Now you can not post a link that starts not on "http" (for example, ftp, https) </li><li>  When writing tags through the ampersand &amp; - they, when re-edited, turn into ordinary tags </li><li>  The conversion of Christmas trees prevents you from inserting any piece of HTML code with attributes in your profile ... </li><li>  Two points after the question mark are converted to ellipsis - as in the preview, and when sent without a preview. </li><li>  A dot after the space sticks to the previous word - both when previewing and when sent without preview.  Example: htaccess file </li><li>  There are no markers in the comments for the lists. </li><li>  ‚ÄúBr‚Äù is inserted in the comment input field after the preview. </li><li>  With negative karma can not save the article in drafts </li><li>  In the profile, the Skype field does not allow you to enter "-", although the Skype name may contain it </li></ul><br>  <b>Engine work</b> <br><ul><li>  Problems for people with negative and close to zero karma - they can not see the evaluation of topics </li><li>  Link "statistics" at the bottom of the page leads to the wrong address (or just does not work) </li><li>  <s>Bug, with <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/search/%3Fq%3D">empty search query</a></s> (fixed) </li><li>  When you enter a password, any length (more than six characters) in the form of password recovery (when asked to enter two times new), the form responds to me that I should not be greedy and enter a password of more than six characters. </li><li>  The addresses of the form ‚Äúname+habr@gmail.com‚Äù stopped working </li><li>  Periodically, people with karma 0 and a power of -0.50 appear in the top, and they are in the first places (in the profile they have written something like "-2833rd in the ranking of habraluy" </li><li>  In the ‚ÄúWork‚Äù section: Choosing a category in the search (Quick Search) does not affect the results, the country / region / city is also not taken into account, the employment filter also does not work.  Field region (country / region / city) of the form is not saved after the search. </li><li>  The last time was on the site January 1, 1970 by some users. </li><li>  Link profile LinkedIn profile - not working.  The link is placed on the profile on Habr√©. </li><li>  With a small weight of voice ratings appear type "-0" </li><li>  "Saved" topics are visible to everyone. </li><li>  Selected comments "mixed up", the bookmarks themselves remained, but the comments are not at all those </li></ul><br>  <b>Are common</b> <br><ul><li>  As before, you can not write a message without becoming the "friend" of the addressee </li><li>  Missing archive of vacancies (bug?) </li><li>  Missing second circle of friends (bug?) </li><li>  <s>Disappeared ‚Äúhabralent‚Äù (bug?)</s> Habralent will be (improved) </li><li>  In habrahabr.ru/css/main.css there is a link to habrahabr.ru/i/bg-write.png which is not </li></ul><br><br>  Forgive me for not pointing out the authorship of the ‚Äúpioneers‚Äù, there are just a lot of them :) I promise to all active karmas and every praise </div>
