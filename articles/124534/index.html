  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Payment systems and their connection. What we pay attention</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Greetings to all! <br>  Since the topic of e-commerce is quite popular here, which in general is logical, I would like on my part (the maximum possible objective opinion of a representative of an aggregation company) to tell about accepting payments.  In particular, remote <i>payment methods</i> . <br>  Surely, everyone already knows a lot, but I will try to tell by what criteria the easiest way to compare all market players and what to look for when connecting, depending on the type of business. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  So, where to start when choosing payment systems? <br>  Initially, there is a "fork": payment systems and payment systems through aggregators. <br>  Here we must understand that it is not directly a fact that it is cheaper, mainly the price tag of the commission depends on the brand itself, on its importance, turnover, etc.  To work directly with PS, you should be interested in them, so that the rate was cheaper than through an integrator.  Otherwise, the commission rate will be the same as through integrators, and maybe more expensive. <br>  For example, if you represent MTS, everyone will be happy to connect under exclusive contracts directly. <br>  But if the start-up, which xs how much will bring in favor of xs what jur.  people will surely refuse you, and if they do not, then: <br>  - implementation of direct technical connection from each of the payment systems (PS); <br>  - signing an agreement with each of the PS; <br>  - in his back offic'e summarizing under the common denominator of all registries, acts, mutual settlements, etc. <br><br>  In general, all this can be done, but is there any point? <br>  Again, for companies, a la "Beeline", of course, is - for them, every 0.1% is poured into a lump sum. <br>  As for all other companies, there is something to think about. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      You can get all PS in a single interface and connection, all acts, etc.  receive, too, only through one company - it is difficult not to agree that it is more convenient. <br>  And the main question - how much is it more expensive? <br>  As for labor costs, this is one API protocol and its implementation falls on the store (merchant), the protocol itself is basically similar, that is, there are parameters that are followed by many payment systems and, accordingly, aggregators. <br><br>  As for the commissions, the difference is not much + + 1 percent, just compare the KP by aggregator. <br>  Here the main thing is to make sure that the commission is taken exactly the one that is listed in the CP and in addition to it nothing is taken from the client.  Otherwise, numerous claims may be sprinkled on the support, that there is only one price on the site, and when it comes to payment, there is a higher price tag. <br><br>  So, you determine that you are connecting to the aggregator ... <br>  What you should pay attention to when choosing: <br><br>  1. Commission.  (Here and everything is clear). <br><br>  2. The timing of transfers for payments. <br><br>  3. Proposed payment systems within one payment gateway. <br>  This is where the gradation of all aggregators.  Many famous, little known, etc.  Companies offer a different set of payment systems.  Basically, the market offers functionality for accepting bank cards and some electronic money. <br>  Some companies offer payments through payment systems that accept cash payments, for example, Qiwi, Euroset, etc. <br>  Again, that is necessary for the merchant himself.  For example, in ticket sales (e-tickets in various areas) bank cards make up 40- 60%, everything else does cash, etc.  Here the logic is simple, the farther from Moscow with St. Petersburg is the client, the less% of card sales.  If your business is focused on regions including, then the cards for many customers, like the "Bermuda Triangle". <br>  Therefore, the more an aggregator can offer you, the better, since, as a rule, nothing is taken for connecting one or another PS. <br><br>  4. The ability to quickly connect to the page on the choice of the payment system from the integrator or, conversely, the ability to impose a page in your design and not redirect the client to the integrator. <br>  Quite a matter of principle.  Many merchants think that their own design of this page is impossible, but in vain ... <br><br>  5. Refund payments.  If the cards are simple, then it is necessary for the rest of PSs that the accepted payments can be returned to the customer bypassing your cash register (I think that many will be in solidarity here). <br><br>  6. For many companies, more precisely for their business, you need to manually invoice manually for a surcharge, maybe integration is not needed - an invoice for one or another PS is issued through the manager. <br><br>  7. Check payment for relevance by API.  Whatever happens, the client has paid for what is already in sight ... <br><br>  8. How much the company undertakes consulting on situations: services to provide and protect the interests of the merchant in matters of chardge backs. <br>  There are many cases when the bank simply holds the amount, and the merchant is only informed about this after the fact. <br>  And what the situation was, etc.  the merchant is not even aware, and maybe it could be easily ‚Äúfought off‚Äù. <br><br>  9. SMS / e-mail notifications and customer support. <br>  It may be that there is nothing like this and you need to take the pressure on all transactions. <br>  Therefore, we need the most detailed personal account for transparency of transactions. <br>  If there are automatic notifications, then this is a big plus so that customers do not call with the questions: ‚ÄúDid my payment go?‚Äù. <br><br>  In general, here is the main difference in aggregators, you want payment systems directly - go ahead! <br>  If you want everything at once, then conduct a comparative analysis on the adequacy of the employees of the aggregator companies, their API and, in general, what the company provides and how it fits into your business processes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124534/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124534/</a></p>
