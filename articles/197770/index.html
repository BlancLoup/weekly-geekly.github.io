One snag is the limit on the number of active projects and demonstration participants.  Paid account solves everything, but our guys have long been itching to arrange a hackathon.  And this means that we will build our Invigin, with drag-n-drop and Google-sync.

      We have one day for the whole project.  We confess that we carried the design and layout outside the hackathon - we did all this directly in front of it.  Like the testing that we postponed the next day.  All this, on the one hand, eliminates our heroic feat, but on the other - the romance in it does not become less. <br><br>  So, the chronicle of the working process with the words of the participants.  At the end - a link to the service itself, for the impatient. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Part 1. The outer side of the hackathon.  Web service for 24 hours </h2><br><h4>  We think! </h4><br>  Mentally throwing out of Invision everything that annoys or just seems superfluous.  We come up with the concept of the future service. <br><br><h4>  Backlog! </h4><br>  We write it quickly, in Google docks.  We make a quick assessment of features, set priorities. <br><br><h4>  Design! </h4><br>  Our art director makes the design of all screens, taking elements from Bootstrap - to facilitate the layout.  Cut from the pieces of the interface, taste: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/881/7eb/910/8817eb9108fb6bf9bfe78c8b8ca88d65.png"><br><br><h4>  Layouts! </h4><br>  We set up work screens in Bootstrap, that's where vanilla hardcore!  Done! <br><br><h4>  Synchronization! </h4><br>  Where is a lot of free server space?  On google!  Who distributes accounts suitable for authorization on our service?  Google again!  What are we going to do synchronization with?  C Google! <br><br><h4>  Projects! </h4><br>  Logged in, created a folder in Google-drive - got a new project in Huizin.  Created a new project in Huizhin - got a new folder in GoogleDrive.  Works! <br><br><h4>  Loading! </h4><br>  We make the most convenient layout loader: circled, dragged, loaded! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a52/43b/957/a5243b957a5179a90549f7bfeac63d81.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Training! </h4><br>  The download wants a beautiful picture, so make it in the Huijin!  Align the slides, select the background color, copy the link! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d1a/ac2/be1/d1aac2be196679998d4add2ae833c5f1.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Demonstration! </h4><br>  Any number of people with Google accounts can watch your layout and comment!  It is enough to poke in the right place, write a comment and voila - colleagues will see it. <br><br><h4>  Testing! </h4><br>  There is no time to test the hackathon, so we thoughtfully test the next day, sipping kakavushku! <br><br><h4>  Depla! </h4><br>  We buy a domain, put it on the hosting, we get a working service! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ce8/885/985/ce888598591c2f817dc477b9a6ed9b52.jpg"><br><br> <a href="http://whoision.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dc1/0d1/9ab/dc10d19abe2de269eaadaae37db3892c.png"></a> <br><br>  <b>What makes Whoision happy:</b> <br><ul><li>  Quick login - one click and you are a full user. </li><li>  Convenient file storage on Google Drive - you can always edit your projects without even going to the service site. </li><li>  Synchronization is always the current state of projects: both in the drive and in the personal account. </li><li>  Customize the display, you can align the slides and pick up the background color - to submit the design in the appropriate form. </li><li>  Joint commenting - helps to collect high-quality and visual feedback. </li></ul><br>  And for the most curious.  A team of volunteers is dedicated. <br><br><h2>  Part 2. The reverse side of the hackathon.  Post factum report </h2><br>  <i>Regularly interviewed copywriter Roma.</i> <br><br>  <strong>Roma:</strong> Guys, all I know is that you had a hackathon and that the project was called Whoision <i>(hereinafter the transcription of ‚Äúhuizhins‚Äù is used - note by the author)</i> . <br><br>  <strong>Alexey:</strong> And still called! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/31e/3ed/4ca/31e3ed4caf8aa7270dc882b7fca5a5cc.png"><br><br>  <strong>Roma:</strong> Ok, so far :) So tell literally everything: how you came to the project, how the hackathon passed.  I understand that it began with the fact that "we decided to make our Invision". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3cd/def/fa5/3cddeffa5c47a5a847d7decebddabc17.png" align="left">  <strong>Vladimir:</strong> Yes, we are bribed by the bourgeoisie, so we did it harshly: we really decided to do our ingis. <br><br>  <strong>Marat:</strong> The guys had a desire to play in their free time.  And, in general, we came and waited.  You had to come back yesterday for a retrospective. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0c1/dc7/412/0c1dc741251654be8f17232356ad196b.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3cd/def/fa5/3cddeffa5c47a5a847d7decebddabc17.png" align="left">  <strong>Vladimir:</strong> By the way, this is the second hackathon.  The first was carried out two years ago, in the end they made an online service for the game in <a href="http://planningpoker.ru/">Planning Poker</a> .  And also for the day. <br><br>  <strong>Roma:</strong> Powerfully!  Well ok, let's order.  You all came by nine in the morning and ... <br><br>  <strong>Alexey:</strong> Nenene, everyone came when he wanted.  Marat came to 11, I to 12. <br><br>  <strong>Ivan:</strong> I came by tradition first, at 9:20, set up the environment ... Then Lech came. <br><br>  <strong>Alexey II:</strong> I warned everyone at home that I was falling out of reality for a day.  They are not without irritation resigned. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f0d/446/ade/f0d446ade5e1ac63bf74aa46a98568c6.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3cd/def/fa5/3cddeffa5c47a5a847d7decebddabc17.png" align="left">  <strong>Vladimir:</strong> Ivan helped a lot in preparation for the start of work.  We had a laid out layout and a ready environment. <br><br>  <strong>Ivan:</strong> Actually, I assumed that the hackathon would be two weeks ago.  Therefore, I read the documentation, prepared something in advance ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f5/b3b/840/4f5b3b84058ca6dc146ad215acff9d91.png"><br><br>  <strong>Roma:</strong> And what was all ready for the beginning?  Have you already worked with the project started, or ...?  Well, who did what - tell me too. <br><br>  <strong>Ivan:</strong> We had a list of features, not the most detailed, though - something had to be thought out along the way.  Layout and the environment, as I said, I prepared in advance. <br><br>  <strong>Marat:</strong> I didn‚Äôt intend to do it myself, I thought, I would test, run for pizza, brew coffee ...;) I came, I didn‚Äôt find the second Lech, I realized that we have two developers and one tester, I had to remember the basics.  By the way, very quickly everything came to mind. <br><br>  <strong>Alexey II:</strong> I stretched the layout, the client part almost did not touch, basically I did the server part: comments, synchronization. <br><br>  <strong>Roma:</strong> As far as I remember, Inzhinin is a pretty sophisticated service where you can upload layouts, leave comments on click, with multiple authorizations.  And what can Huizhin? <br><br>  <strong>Marat:</strong> They tried to teach him how to order pizza - they never taught :) In general, you can upload your layouts for the service and show the result of the work to the customer.  Authorization on the service occurs automatically, using a Google account.  On Google-drive, all images are stored, that is, if you create a new project in Huizhin and upload pictures to it, you have a whoision folder on the drive, in which a folder by project name appears.  And layouts are poured into it.  Simple and very convenient. <br><br>  <strong>Ivan:</strong> If you upload pictures in Google Drive, then projects are also created in Huizhin.  That is, reverse synchronization works.  On the project for the first time tried to write on node.js - a cool thing.  We also worked with Mongo DB, also liked this database. <br><br>  <strong>Roma:</strong> Were there conflicts on the project? <br><br>  <strong>Aleksey:</strong> Conflicts were basically the same scenario: one creates a class, the second enters the code and immediately begins to refactor it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3cd/def/fa5/3cddeffa5c47a5a847d7decebddabc17.png" align="left">  <strong>Vladimir:</strong> There is such a disease, called "this code is shit, because I did not write it" :) <br><br>  <strong>Marat:</strong> We had fun, I got a lot of buzz.  I remembered how to program, just visited this fumes of intoxication. <br><br>  <strong>Alexey:</strong> I thought I would not hold out until the end.  In the end, still sat up to one in the morning. <br><br>  <strong>Marat:</strong> Yes, it's just that Lehoy and I left the club at eight in the morning.  Then everyone woke up and realized that today is a hackathon.  We slept for two or three hours each. <br><br>  <strong>Roma:</strong> How did they survive? <br><br>  <strong>Ivan:</strong> In the afternoon they stopped at ping-pong, after which my head earned much better. <br><br>  <strong>Roma:</strong> And what did they refuel? <br><br>  <strong>Aleksey:</strong> At about five in the morning, Marat and I began to plump. <br><br>  <strong>Marat:</strong> Lies and slander: D <br><br>  <strong>Alexey II:</strong> I tried to work on power engineers.  So, Adrenalin Rush with a banana - shit! <br><br>  <strong>Roma:</strong> How long were the tasks?  And in general, why hakaton?  After all, it was easy to set aside time, reserve a team, plan sprints ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3cd/def/fa5/3cddeffa5c47a5a847d7decebddabc17.png" align="left">  <strong>Vladimir:</strong> Immediately funny that this drive.  And what a day you can collect a fairly large project on pure adrenaline.  And on such projects, you can sharpen technology without fear of a fax.  Make up - well, okay.  In general, according to the results of the evaluation of tasks, it was 80 hours, which the four of us could not do for a day.  Therefore, the preliminary work was still - thanks to Ivan.  And I think this is correct - there should only be a drive in the hackathon;) <br><br>  <strong>Alexey II:</strong> I liked it for the first time on the hackathon, time passed very quickly.  Come - hop!  - it's time to play tennis, - hop!  - made the project. <br><hr><br>  Here is a story. <br><br>  I personally would be very grateful if you want to test the service and write comments and suggestions.
