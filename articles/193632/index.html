  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Time Management Love and Hate</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> It seems it was 2007.  By that time, I had already left my last job and had been developing my first business for more than a year.  It was fun, hard and almost without a chance for a positive result.  It was a video surveillance company.  Naturally, I made all the mistakes that could be made.  At some point, I quarreled with my partner and decided to spit on everything.  Besides, the moment turned up more than successful - I saw somewhere on the net that Gleb Arkhangelsky is looking for a CEO (or executive?).  And I went to him for an interview. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Naturally, like everything else, I was fascinated by his book ‚ÄúTime Drive.  How to manage to live and work ".  I read it in one breath, and it seemed to me - this is it!  Well, Christmas trees are like sticks, as everything turned out to be simple - eat ‚Äúfrogs‚Äù every day, use Outlook to plan your tasks, divide tasks into important and unimportant, urgent and non-urgent, etc.  Frog is good.  Metaphors are generally well remembered.  But here I sit and remember what else was there, in this ‚Äúmethod of Gleb Arkhangelsky‚Äù?  To be honest, I remember with difficulty.  But I remember very well what happened to me further, after reading his book. <br><br>  I began to write.  I had a PDA, and if there was an opportunity, I wrote something down there with a stylus in Excel plates.  I rode the subway and wrote down.  I dined somewhere with friends and wrote down.  Returned home and recorded.  They asked me: ‚ÄúWhat do you write there all the time?‚Äù.  "I plan," I replied. <br><br>  I AM PLANNING.  I felt proud of myself.  Finally, I understood how to live.  How to develop a business.  It is necessary to do more time to do it - thanks to the magic pill called ‚Äútime management‚Äù, this is now so easy to do! <br>  With the feeling that now everything will be different, I went a month.  Well, maybe two.  Or three.  Hardly anymore.  By the fourth month, I began to remind myself of zombies.  But not a simple zombie, but very busy with their zombie affairs.  Well, you know what zombies can have?  Here he walks, wanders through the city at night, scares passers-by.  And he writes everything down, writes down, writes down something in his laptop.  Planning some garbage.  Human logic is inaccessible.

      I thought I was so flawed.  And I saw the announcement of Gleb Arkhangelsky.  I thought he would finally teach me how to be a correct zombie, and not a zombie who is passionate about his zombie affairs.  And then there are some problems in business.  I was a co-owner, but I was not a CEO.  It seemed to me that our partner was leading us into the abyss, but I could not influence him in any way.  And it seemed to me - this is a chance to end my torment.  Looking ahead, I will tell you that in the end everything turned out well.  I did not become an executive (or general?) Director of Gleb Arkhangelsky, but in the end I became general director in my company, gained control, brought the company to a new level and sold my share for quite good money for me at that time.  By the way, this company is still on the market, and feels good. <br><br>  Later, I often returned to the problem of time management.  I tried GTD, I tried other systems.  I read something somewhere, I came to my own way, but in the end I worked out a few rules that, I think, really moved me forward - especially at <a href="http://texterra.ru/">Texterra</a> , which I started to engage in just after the sale. first company. <br><br>  But before moving towards these points, I want to say this.  The whole "time management" is useless if you have the thesis that your personal effectiveness will help to avoid problems.  Will not help.  The more ‚Äúeffective‚Äù you personally will be, the more problems you will have to face.  It's like a squirrel in a wheel.  You can turn the wheel slowly, and you can quickly.  Yes, the faster you turn, the more ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù kilometers you wind up.  But who said it was good?  And who said that in this happiness? <br><br>  The only way to get rid of dependence on ‚Äúfrogs‚Äù and ‚Äúexcise‚Äù is to recognize the fact that problems and their subsequent correction is a normal part of our life.  Someone treats problems normally, someone hates problems, but problems are normal!  People, really, successful in business in the majority are the people solving problems.  Not thinking how to avoid them, to build, classify according to one or another rank - these are people who go to the zone of chaos and expand the boundaries of their faith all the time. <br><br>  The human brain is built in a very strange way - it strives towards a ‚Äúcomfort zone‚Äù - where we are easy and understandable.  The ‚Äúcomfort zone‚Äù is order.  When you buy the same products in the same stores, when you refuel at the same gas stations, which are on the way, when you know what you will do at work today and what you will do at home next weekend - know you find in the "comfort zone".  This is not good.  That's not bad.  This is common to all normal people.  Here is the scheme I sketched in Paint: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/655/564/f4e/655564f4e690608dd0a7b7523c535ee2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But if you want to achieve something in any area, the only option is to go to a zone of absolute chaos.  You need absolute chaos to love.  It is impossible to live in chaos, but if you go to a zone of absolute chaos, your daily life will begin to shift from a zone of absolute order to a zone of such semi-chaos, chaos that lies within your faith, which is not completely ordered by you, but you actually know , how to do it.  And the more persistently you aspire to the zone of chaos, the faster the boundaries of your faith expand. <br>  How to love and start moving into a zone of chaos?  (Remember that your brain will constantly call you back - to the zone of order, control and routine). <br><br>  <b>The first.</b>  Stop, finally, reproach yourself for outstanding tasks.  You are not a zombie - you are a living person! <br><br>  <b>The second.</b>  Concentrate more on the basic things for your life, not on the routine.  Perform more targeted actions, and fewer non-target actions - no matter how necessary they seem to you at the moment.  As a rule, the basic things for your life lie beyond the boundaries of the faith - and it is necessary by trial and error to find a way to them, and not to tread down the paths in the zone of order. <br><br>  <b>Third.</b>  Before you ‚Äúplan‚Äù something, ask yourself the question - what the hell is this?  Does doing this action really bring me closer to my main goal? <br><br>  <b>Fourth.</b>  There is no need to "plan" the case, if it can be completed in 5 minutes - just take it and do it. <br><br>  <b>The fifth.</b>  Tired of doing something every day?  Hire an employee for this job.  I'm serious.  You in vain think that your sverhvazhnye affairs nobody else can perform, except you, can not. <br><br>  <b>The sixth.</b>  No matter how effective you personally are, unfortunately, this does not greatly affect your business.  Real business growth is achieved not through the personal effectiveness of the manager, but through effective business processes. <br><br>  <b>Seventh.</b>  Allow yourself to experiment.  Sometimes it is useful to take and simply move all your business to hell. <br><br>  <b>Eighth.</b>  Sleep for a long time.  I have a real problem with this, you need to force yourself to sleep! <br><br>  <b>Ninth.</b>  If what used to be in the zone of chaos for you has become a habitual routine (and it will definitely become at some point) - do not continue to do this work out of habit.  It's time to hire a good performer for this job. <br><br>  Now I have a difficult task.  Unsurpassed.  The increase in traffic of our own website from 10 thousand unikas to 20 thousand unikis per month for three months, excluding PPC and other paid channels.  I do not know how to solve this problem here and now.  And that means I'm doing it right. <br><br>  Well, what was in the office of Gleb?  I came, I saw a very tired person - maybe it was temporary, but I remembered the guru like this: tired.  It was much more interesting to watch what was going on outside the window than to communicate with me.  There were some questions - like what he did, what he achieved.  How I spend my work day.  What tasks have to be solved.  Gleb asked me reluctantly, from his first glance it was clear to me that he would not take me to work for himself.  I left him with relief.  The first thing I did when I returned to my office was to take down all the lists of my frogs from all laptops and laptops.  They are still somewhere lazily jerking their legs in my past.  Well, let it not be a pity. <br><br>  Denis Saveliev </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/193632/">https://habr.com/ru/post/193632/</a></p>
