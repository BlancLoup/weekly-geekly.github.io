  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cup of tar</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://altayim.narod.ru/bubenback.jpg"><br>  This topic is filled with rays of kindness and humanity.  No, really.  I dearly love not only Debian, but also Ubuntu, its prophet, but this topic is not about holivars.  I would rather like to tell you what other joys of life can be expected by a person who suddenly decided to upgrade to Ubuntu 9.10.  Immediately in connection with this, I want to make a reservation for those who will shout to me about the need for a clean installation, etc.  etc .: expensive, the system should be updated, and not rearranged every six months.  Otherwise, those of you who remember Windows 95 will inevitably have memories about it.  Without ext4 I‚Äôll survive somehow, I already have all the rest of the clean installs. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But back to the upgrade system.  The download is over, all the packages asked me everything they could, it was time to reboot. <br>  The first thing I see after a reboot is, of course, the console at boot.  Previously, when I started the console, I took two types - in the middle of the download, the contents of the screen changed dramatically, thanks to the installation of the font.  Now these types of 4 - in the middle of changing the font, then changing the screen resolution, then changing the font again, why so - only the sky knows.  But God with fonts, this is a small garbage, because we have already loaded gdm. <br>  And here we have a surprise number two.  Rather, even two surprises.  The first is the once carefully established gdm theme demolished to hell, the standard one has been established.  And it would be okay, but in the process of updating, Ubunt asked me about the configs that she wanted to replace - there was no question about gdm, I‚Äôm telling you for sure.  The second surprise is even more unpleasant - these are terrible brakes already in gdm.  I switch to the first console and immediately discover the third surprise: carefully tuned Russian fonts - the eternal problem of ubuntas - are torn down by the <s>ruthless hand of the</s> default config set without asking.  Yes, about the console-tools config ubunt did not ask me a single question, thanks to vim who saved the <b>config</b> file <b>~</b> . <br>  But okay, go to the htop and see there is a java process devouring all the resources.  I look and see - it turns out that the bootchart, once installed, is having fun.  It does not matter, now we will demolish ... I thought a second before the terminal dropped into the Maintenance Shell.  ‚ÄúOpachki!‚Äù - exactly such a thought flashed through my head at 6 o'clock in the morning.  No questions, the second console did not disappear anywhere, the bootchart on it was uninstalled with a decisive hand (by the way, after the reboot, I still get something about the bootchart, but it doesn‚Äôt slow down - and I‚Äôm too lazy to understand).  I read what the matter is and find out: the mounting of hard disks periodically swears at fstab and the inability to mount all partitions without exception.  How is this, even if X are loaded, I did not understand.  Nevertheless, by peering and using telepathic skills, we managed to find that the system no longer likes the UUID: <br><blockquote>  UUID = f4a4d9f8-488c-41fe-aa01-f07e1ac2d460 / ext3 relatime, errors = remount-ro 0 1 </blockquote><br>  Yes exactly.  And this, I am not afraid of this word, PPC - hello, the beginning of the century.  Because even on my laptop, where all the above mentioned actions take place, the hard disk is no longer, like a year ago, defined as <b>/ dev / sdb</b> .  Now it is <b>/ dev / sda</b> .  What will happen in 10.04 - can it decide again how / dev / sdb to recognize?  Why did ubuntu fall out of love with UUID?  Put / dev / sda [n] everywhere - it worked.  But it‚Äôs about the lack of a UUID that I resent most of all.  If I can still try e2label and mounting via ‚ÄúLABEL =‚Äù for the root partition, what should I do with the swap and NTFS partitions? <br><br>  But in general, after an hour of dancing, the system turned out to be really faster than 9.04.  And the fonts in the gnome have improved a lot. <br>  But remember: never, never Linux, even ubuntu, will beat a tambourine for you.  At least not in the coming years. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> No, I found the bug even more disgusting: now ACPI does not work for me - trying to send a laptop to sleep just locks the desktop, and slightly increasing the brightness - it starts to increase and decrease the brightness by division indefinitely.  At the same time, of course, Ubunt's pop-up notifications begin to appear, and the whole system is terribly inhibited.  Alas, it‚Äôs impossible to work with it, so I won‚Äôt record the screencast :)

      <b>PPS</b> Search gave information that for fixing problems with ACPI before starting the system, you need to turn off the camera (this is a problem with BisonCam drivers on MSI Wind, disconnects by Fn + F6), for fixing brightness problems in / etc / default / grub to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX add nomodeset to disable KMS.  I hope this will help someone. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/73846/">https://habr.com/ru/post/73846/</a></p>
