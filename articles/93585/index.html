  <section class="page js-page"><h1>First day of the Panasonic 3D Convention. Impressions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The day before yesterday I attended the largest event of the Panasonic - 3D Convention, which was held in Crocus. <br>  The event was interesting and informative. <br>  In my opinion, everything was very well organized: all those who came were divided into groups so that they would not crowd, and at the entrance they would give out special radios, on which it was possible to find a guide of their group.  Cool idea to not lose anyone) <br>  Basically, Panasonic TVs were presented at the convention - there were a lot of them.  Viera, it turns out, has a bunch of product lines: the V, S, G series and so on.  All of them differ in some parameters.  But the most interesting exhibit for me was the TV giant with the 3D function.  Its diagonal is 152 ", its length is about 4 meters! That‚Äôs how it looked: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6a1/f16/4b2/6a1f164b2012058d0d86e2625345bf29.jpg" alt="image"><br>  It, by the way, reflects the staff of Panasonic, who conducted product presentations for us.  The image of this plasma is impressive - much better than in a 3D movie theater.  I think that this is because of the quality of the picture - it was so clear and bright that it sometimes even blinded the eyes.  In this TV, we were shown a presentation 3D-video: shooting the Olympics in Vancouver and construction work in Sochi (Panasonic is the sponsor of the Olympic Games, hence the attention to sports). <br>  At the entrance to this cinema, 3D glasses were handed out. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b21/d62/b39/b21d62b395925cac03d0d569aabe1e45.jpg" alt="image"><br>  About the stands.  As I said, there are a lot of different kinds of TVs.  Panasonic, by the way, presented for comparison the telephones of competitors, framing them with black frames (so that we would not guess whose ones they are).  What can I say, of the presented models, Viera 2010 really showed the best.  Interestingly, the 2009 model was significantly inferior to the new product in terms of brightness and color.  Finished) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/82e/fa9/efa/82efa9efa71c635d28257f23711fb332.jpg" alt="image"><br>  What do you remember besides cool 3D TVs?  It was very interesting to learn about the existence of 64 gigabyte memory cards. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ec6/a57/2fa/ec6a572fa18033a3a917eee011ee689b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The most interesting technology seemed to me Viera Cast, which allows you to access the Internet directly from Viera TVs.  We were told how to call each other on Skype, watch videos on YouTube, find out the weather forecast.  The company introduced another new product - now it will be possible to go on Twitter on Viera TVs.  Only it will be from June. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8d3/134/7b3/8d31347b3e58391d314a50af3ff11a4e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  At this booth, we called Skype from one TV to another.  The call, by the way, is very simple - you can go to the menu using the remote control from the TV and select various functions (answer, answer with video, reject, etc.).  It was interesting to watch yourself in the huge Viera TV screens. <br>  See how surprised we are all (pay attention to the bottom of the TV screens - there you can see Skype icons): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/928/dcb/fdc/928dcbfdc5acbb14efde653c6b25af6c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In new models, you can view photos directly on the screen by selecting slideshow and splash modes. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bc4/543/7ce/bc45437ce54384a9af743778d1e9577d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And Panasonic showed its ‚Äúgreen‚Äù stand with eco-technology. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0e6/878/4c7/0e68784c72b5bbe149883a1a7c1fb5cc.jpg" alt="image"></div>
