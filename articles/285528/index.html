The VPN was set up specifically for developers to work from home.  The logs showed a regular sequence of logins to the company's main servers from the Chinese Shenyang, using the account of a certain employee, B. <br><br>  Initially, the company's IT specialists <a href="http://securityblog.verizonbusiness.com/2013/01/14/case-study-pro-active-log-review-might-be-a-good-idea/">were convinced</a> that this was the result of some malicious software that exploited the zero-day vulnerability, which allowed to establish connections from B.'s work computer to an external proxy server, and then open a VPN connection to the machine in China, but this guess was not confirmed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After permission was received to study B.'s network behavior, employees of the Verizon telecommunications service provider found that B. uses the services of a software consultant from Shenyang who does his job.  B. sent FedEx to China with his two-factor authentication key so that the contractor can log into his account.  Hundreds of invoices from China were found on B.'s work computer.  B. received a six-digit number of dollars a year, and to pay for the services of the Chinese, as if according to Pareto's law, only one-fifth of this amount went.
