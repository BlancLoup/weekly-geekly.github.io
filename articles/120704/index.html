  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Smart home: planning and preparing yourself</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Every day we increasingly trust the solution of our everyday problems to computer equipment.  What used to be only science fiction today is a reality.  We spend the lion's share of time at home, so it would be logical to trust modern computer technologies to help us maintain comfort. <br><br>  So, intellectually building, or as it is often called - "smart home".  Today, this is not a very cheap pleasure, but mobile phones once were worth fabulous money.  How to prepare a house / apartment today, during the renovation, so that you do not have to make walls in the future? <br><br>  We will try to reflect on this in this article.

For this price, you will be able to block the pipelines when gas or water leaks are detected.  Not cheap, but is your peace of mind worth the money? <br><br>  More advanced packages, in which the alarm is tied, the simplest light control starts already <b>from</b> $ 10,000. <br><br>  But for your $ 30 000+ $ you already get a full package of pleasures with touch panels spaced around the house, with motion sensors controlling light and much more. <br><br>  If we are talking about the arrangement of an apartment of a small area or a house of 1000 squares, then the price will of course change to a lower or higher cost, respectively. <br><br>  It all depends on the desires and capabilities of customers. <br><br><h4>  What to bloat? </h4><br>  Of course, today, the trendsetter in the field of intelligent buildings is Bill Gates, with his very expensive <a href="http://blog.ukrbiznes.com/578.html">house</a> of 3,700 square meters. <br><br>  The most important is to ensure the integrity and security of the home, as well as the preservation of the lives of its inhabitants.  Therefore: <br><ul><li>  gas leak detection system with supply shut-off valve </li><li>  water leak detection system with flow shut-off valve </li><li>  smoke / fire detection system </li><li>  security system (intrusion, video surveillance) </li></ul><br>  All of these systems can be tied to automatically calling the appropriate response services, notifying the host by phone / sms, launching other scenarios (switching off the electricity supply, turning off the ventilation, etc.) <br><br>  The following is a level of comfort: <br><ul><li>  light and backlight control </li><li>  irrigation management </li><li>  control of ventilation, air conditioning, heating, weather tracking </li><li>  control of building mechanization (roller shutters, gates, wickets) </li><li>  power supply management (switching to backup power sources, starting the generator, monitoring battery status) </li><li>  audio and video control systems </li></ul><br>  All systems are tied to one control unit (central computer) with the distribution of radio consoles, touch panels around the house.  Various scripts are connected.  For example, by pressing the "cinema" button, the roleta automatically close, the lighting is switched off smoothly, the screen is lowered, the projector is turned on, and the speaker system is turned on. <br><br>  Conclusion: if you even come up with something new, then most likely it can be implemented.  It all depends on the selling price. <br><br>  Today, the market has a fairly large selection of sensors, sensors, motors, control units.  You can buy and Chinese, and branded equipment.  Prices and quality are appropriate.  For example, a dimmer (smooth on / off light) will cost you around 300 euros, and a touchscreen that sellers of ready-made solutions will try to "push" sellers will cost 1500. At the same time, you can buy the same screen in the store for $ 500. <br><br><h4>  It would be desirable, but expensive!  What to do? </h4><br>  The obvious solution is to prepare the apartment / house at the repair stage, and then when the post-repair financial situation recovers, or when all these sensors and controllers drop in price - just install them on the prepared place. <br><br><h4>  Where to begin? </h4><br>  The first thing to do is <b>make a list</b> . <br><br>  Thoroughly think about what you want to manage.  It is better to spend a few days on this, interview all those who will live in this house.  After that, it is better to postpone the project for several days, and then re-read it, making the necessary changes. <br><br>  The second step is <b>to decide WHAT and WHERE to be installed</b> . <br><br>  This step is quite complicated, because  ‚ÄúNon-experts‚Äù can make mistakes, but if you turn on logic (aka common sense), the task is simplified.  After all, it is quite logical that if we are talking about the ‚Äúmotor‚Äù of blinds control, then it should be located in the immediate vicinity of the blinds, and if it is a motion sensor, then it should be located in the corners with the greatest visibility. <br><br>  After completing this step, you can use a little trick: there are quite a large number of forums where developers, installers, and just people with experience go through it.  Do not be lazy, lay out your sketches on these forums, and listen to what you advise.  After that, your ideas can be implemented. <br><br>  And finally - <b>think through and pave communications</b> . <br><br>  Today, a lot of equipment is sold for ‚Äúquick installation‚Äù with the ability to communicate over the air.  This is certainly convenient, but entails some difficulties.  In particular, for some performing elements the electricity supply is still needed, and in the sensor units you will have to change batteries.  So the wires are our friend. <br><br>  At the time of design without subsequent installation, it is not known which equipment of the company will be used, respectively, it is not completely clear which wire will transmit the signal.  You can try to guess, but it is better to do with a margin. <br><br>  Therefore, laying a UTP cable + ordinary 3-wire copper wire can cover most of the existing systems at once.  To connect video cameras, it is better to stretch a coaxial cable (such cameras are usually much cheaper than IP cameras). <br><br><h4>  And finally, a couple of little tricks </h4><br>  All wiring should converge in shields.  This also applies to conventional room light switches (even <b>before</b> connecting the wiring to the "smart home").  In this case, switching between systems, connecting new control elements will be reduced to simple switching. <br><br>  IR sensors control equipment should be in sight of this equipment.  Accordingly, to control the TV, cinema, air conditioning, it is necessary to lay the wiring in some "secret" point in front of the device.  This may be the front edge of the bedside table, on which the TV stands - if only there was visibility. <br><br>  High-voltage and low-voltage cables must be routed to separate shields, and the wiring should be as separate as possible. <br><br>  It is very desirable to lay cable channels.  If necessary, this cable channel will be able to tighten the new cable.  It is convenient to do this with a vacuum cleaner: vacuuming a wool thread with a knotted ball at the end, then tying this thread either to a steel wire guide, or directly to the cable (if the distance is not very long) and pulling it out. <br><br>  By the way, maybe someone will be useful: for pulling cables, there are special clips with an eyelet on the end.  This deyvays is called ‚Äúcable stocking‚Äù. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/26e/a1c/484/26ea1c484c11f22718e6252e7533efcf.jpg" alt="steel cable stocking"><br><br>  Good luck in the design! <br><br>  UPD: A good <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/sysadm/118817/">article</a> about the designer from the control units of a smart home, with examples of writing your own code for monitoring and control. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120704/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120704/</a></p>
