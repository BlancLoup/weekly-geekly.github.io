  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Apple moves to service in the Google cloud</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There is still <a href="http://www.crn.com/news/cloud/300080062/cloud-makes-for-strange-bedfellows-apple-signs-on-with-google-cuts-spending-with-aws.htm">unofficial information</a> that Apple has contracted Google and is transferring iCloud and other services from Amazon Web Services hosting to the Google Cloud Platform cloud.  This fact was confirmed by several sources, the transaction was concluded on the terms of the NDA. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Sources report that the Apple agreement with Google was concluded at the end of 2015, and since then Apple has significantly reduced the cost of AWS.  At the same time, Apple has not gone completely and continues to use the services of AWS. <br><br>  According to information from Google partners, the company reported that Apple‚Äôs revenue for the Google Cloud Platform service would be from $ 400 million to $ 600 million. Apparently, this is an estimate of annual income. <br><br>  In the February Morgan Stanley report, Apple‚Äôs spending on AWS was estimated at $ 1 billion annually.  It was noted that Apple is able to reduce this amount, if it is more actively using its own data centers.  Apple allocated $ 3.9 billion to build data centers in Arizona, Ireland and Denmark, the first of which will begin work before the end of this year.

      Apple has been using AWS and Microsoft Azure cloud hosting since 2011.  Although neither Amazon nor Microsoft confirmed this information (the NDA terms are valid for them), Apple itself mentioned the fact in <a href="https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf">the iOS security guide</a> in 2014. <br><br>  At first glance, it looks strange that Apple agreed to cooperate with its main competitor in the mobile OS market.  But when it comes to saving hundreds of millions of dollars on cloud hosting - such transactions are possible.  In turn, this is also a profitable offer for Google, because the Google Cloud Platform will increase its market share and come closer to AWS and Microsoft Azure. <br><br>  According to Synergy Research, for the IV quarter.  In 2015, Compute Engine and App Engine products brought Google less than $ 300 million ‚Äî about seven times less than AWS.  The share of the Amazon cloud market - 31%, with Google - 4%.  The AWS cloud capacity corresponds to the total capacity of the 14 closest competitors combined. <br><br>  Experts point out that Google Cloud Platform quite aggressively attracts large corporate clients to its side: last month they lured away with the streaming service Spotify from AWS.  Other clients include Snapchat, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Coca-Cola, HTC and Best Buy. <br><br>  ‚ÄúGoogle is building far more fiber in more areas, so they have much broader coverage than other players in the cloud market,‚Äù said Michael Fraser, chief executive of InfiniteOps, cloud vendor, Google Cloud Platform Partner, AWS and Azure.  ‚ÄúGoogle now provides the cheapest services on the market, given their different initiatives‚Äù, while the Google Cloud Platform provides better performance than other large cloud platforms. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/391769/">https://habr.com/ru/post/391769/</a></p>
