Despite the fact that it happened on weekdays, there were a lot of people on it, and people came to it not only from other cities, but also from other countries.  Visitors from Ukraine were easy to learn, they asked for the price in dollars. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/425/118/061/42511806130d5ce9e25aaecfa6a06e22.jpg"><br><br>  We didn‚Äôt just go to the exhibition, we also took part in it, presenting two very interesting products.  They wanted three, but did not have time for delivery. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What we represented </h4><br>  We brought and showed two devices.  The first is 3doodler 3d pens:

It is the same as the printer heats and squeezes the plastic, and it freezes in the air. <br><br>  The second is a Form 1 printer. This is the first home and affordable stereophotolithographic printer that can print with a resolution of 25 microns and a minimum thickness of 300 microns. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5c6/005/2e0/5c60052e0506d46f3b61dfa72167aa93.jpg"><br><br>  They also wanted to bring Buccaneer - the cheapest of the serial printers, worth only 30 thousand, but the guys are just <br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pirate3d/the-buccaneer-the-3d-printer-that-everyone-can-use/posts/742692">working on prototypes</a> . <br><br><h4>  Exhibition </h4><br>  The exhibition begins with the Big Light Board and a small signboard stand: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/133/637/906/133637906bd132545e8f363ea9099388.jpg"><br><br>  Although for us it started much earlier.  About two weeks before the event, we learned about it, and realized that we could not miss it.  We had to really try to bring the first batch of 3doodler 3d pens in such a short time.  But nevertheless, we had time.  Though they took the pens from customs on the day the exhibition started. <br><br>  Evening on the eve of the exhibition.  Banners were brought to the office: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b0a/5b3/446/b0a5b34462759b54f33725d9fd36a410.jpg"><br><br>  And along with them, they finally brought passes to the exhibition: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/23d/b20/dd6/23db20dd66fb052da7701c62b961f608.jpg"><br><br>  We took two TVs, promotional materials printed on FORM 1 figures (I printed them all the previous week, <a href="http://instagram.com/vvz_vlad">subscribers</a> were aware), and went to watch the place: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba6/ed9/f31/ba6ed9f31f5fe5616e167e1a6d0e2180.jpg"><br><br>  10 hours before the start it was very quiet and not crowded: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/511/6c3/91b/5116c391ba486211540c5f1a606b964f.jpg"><br><br>  Only a few people finished their stands.  Brought and laid out plastic: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c9a/c3c/9d9/c9ac3c9d9e9dbad363522bac2ccce45a.jpg"><br><br>  We hung up TVs, beautifully laid out print samples on the shelves: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/53b/c92/9ea/53bc929ea83829606fb07c2900769a11.jpg"><br><br>  Estimate the amount.  Looking ahead, I will say that by the end of the exhibition it has decreased significantly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1d0/936/551/1d09365514fe7b38dd1b2ee7f31181b5.jpg"><br><br>  Actually, there was nothing left to do, the pens were supposed to be brought only tomorrow, and the printer was in my house, and I had to bring it in the morning. <br><br>  The next morning, getting up at 6 am, I called a taxi, loaded the printer there and went to the exhibition.  It was dark and quiet: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/334/dc0/111/334dc0111d5783287edfd88dacfbf87f.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, a life hack for the future: if you pull a heavy and big box with a smart face, you will not be asked for a ticket to the exhibition.  I was not asked. <br><br>  We didn‚Äôt have time to prepare the stand to the end, when the dam broke through and the people popped: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c38/ffd/30a/c38ffd30afccaa058efba93c8e7ea18a.jpg"><br><br>  Further memories in the form of some scattered pictures, everything was so dynamic.  I was running around the exhibition, trying to photograph something, eat, talk about the printer, talk to my friends, start printing and answer questions at the same time. <br><br>  Here <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ni404/" class="user_link">ni404</a> interview: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4cf/d21/2c7/4cfd212c7dcb451f5c0f33ae974f6f7a.jpg"><br><br>  Here we print the jaw on a printer ordered by one of the visitors (the file he brought with him): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f7/599/fcb/1f7599fcbcd62bf2ec89f653a35ac13c.jpg"><br><br>  Here the girl is worried that she cannot draw in the air: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c13/0a3/f8b/c130a3f8bb1f19f18905cc185a482f0b.jpg"><br><br>  Someone painted Flappy Bird: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ca3/89b/115/ca389b11514938c668158065d19a0631.jpg"><br><br>  Here is a <a href="http://instagram.com/p/kW-CwksUyP/">delta printer</a> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/284/65b/752/28465b75241d13a7558da52b7dbfd97b.jpg"><br><br>  No not like this.  Delta Printer, human height: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3d7/cb5/f7b/3d7cb5f7bf72a5e1a3f7a0a541e33894.jpg"><br><br>  Here is a large gypsum printer that printed <a href="http://instagram.com/p/kXdlz4MUxH/">gingerbread men</a> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/402/388/164/402388164937a963de8e9b590210bca4.jpg"><br><br>  Here is a <a href="http://instagram.com/p/kWuD87MUx6/">paper printer</a> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/784/de1/aea/784de1aea536cef2fec366bf26ae8f83.jpg"><br><br>  The dude who walked with his little figure: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af6/4e7/d1d/af64e7d1df4ffb9d5a996ff658861496.jpg"><br><br>  The figures were cool, and in large quantities: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b0f/072/88a/b0f07288aee8b2970ed1d752d942f16e.jpg"><br><br>  True, why they are needed, and not too humane price (about 7k apiece), so no one told me. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8bc/ad1/53c/8bcad153cc675567c1885fc5fed4d8fe.jpg"><br><br>  Here are the models of houses with a removable roof - this is another matter: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/607/e74/a1c/607e74a1c586902541e51d62e50be34f.jpg"><br><br>  Here we are handed a diploma.  And no, it's just a certificate of participation in the exhibition: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cf3/bb9/573/cf3bb95734571b0a4682c4d73295c4b4.jpg"><br><br>  Here we are attacked by people who want to draw 3d-figures (by the way, there is me in the photo): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f79/85b/bd7/f7985bbd73d193dae388cf713c34f320.jpg"><br><br>  Some visitors sit down and do awesome things the first time: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13b/4d4/9b2/13b4d49b26ca46e0541dc7be5b8bc403.jpg"><br><br>  And by the end of the second day we were able to finish such a tower: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d19/255/9f4/d192559f42a8097d9d34b2a5c6339cdb.jpg"><br><br>  But Russian 3D printers: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6c4/02e/f8e/6c402ef8e6a4114e80fec55558865df9.jpg"><br><br>  And also a Russian frezer on the basis of something dremele-like: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1fa/653/dd0/1fa653dd0300356b8a87f45737ea7197.jpg"><br><br>  LED cube showing something incomprehensible, but spectacular. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f5e/b74/1b0/f5eb741b02b477de8a54f9e9fb4f38db.jpg"><br><br>  People selling printer assembly kits for the price (24k), a little different from the <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/3d/3d-printer-buccaneer/">printer</a> itself (29k): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c5e/648/2cf/c5e6482cfde65c1a3be190a2e76a342a.jpg"><br><br>  Here is a part of the stand with the printer: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/367/b61/605/367b616051be1b84a633ceccd76ed214.jpg"><br><br>  But prints for investment casting.  The printer that printed them costs about 4 million rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/598/d9e/f9e/598d9ef9ea2ba3c26ae2c5339ef46d67.jpg"><br><br>  Nearby sat the uncle, a representative of the company, who offended us.  And he was offended because the most frequent question that he was asked for two days was: ‚Äúand there beside form 1, why with a comparable quality your printer costs 4 million, and there are 130,000 of them?‚Äù <br><br>  Reports about the history, technology and prospects of 3D printing were made nearby: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/58f/168/90e/58f16890e62e678862995b57635921c7.jpg"><br><br>  A little further printers printed chocolate: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/555/774/0c7/5557740c71e5033d37fe7e81044d3ffe.jpg"><br><br>  Not only figures, but also inscriptions: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/581/c19/4d1/581c194d1c2316fbe2734cd87b1d4452.jpg"><br><br>  And at our stand everything was drawing and painting: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ff/cc1/960/4ffcc196064e70c59ec0a33a57fd563b.jpg"><br><br>  Here's what's left of the prints by the end of the second day: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5a3/589/8cc/5a35898cc032a896fe0802ad11a6af83.jpg"><br><br>  The number of figures has decreased significantly.  No, they certainly did not steal them.  Simply, people fascinated by the beauty and accuracy of printing, left, forgetting (or simply not able to) return the figures to the stand. <br><br><h4>  How to make custom chocolates: </h4><br>  In order to somehow reduce the concentration of printers (or else they will print Decepticons, and then rebuild the city) per square meter, the organizers called the <a href="http://www.chocolatier.ru/">chocolatier</a> company, which brought chocolate fountains and equipment for making chocolate on the spot.  Mini-report, "how do chocolates." <br>  It all starts with an apparatus in which chocolate is melted.  Here is this: <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Be careful, traffic!</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3d7/d72/632/3d7d72632909d33efa41036658721b78.gif"><br>  Or this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/df3/d18/c76/df3d18c76473d3ecbdd49a1b3a85b3a7.jpg"><br>  The second is cooler.  Because he has a different temperature in the tank and at the tube outlet: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d0f/eff/742/d0feff742985174d1621e1ccd54cd402.jpg"><br>  But the first looks spectacular.  Different temperatures are needed in order for the chocolate poured into the form to harden faster - it turns out to be softer, tastier, and with a more glossy surface. <br>  Chocolate leaving the heater is poured into the form: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/da1/1ac/af8/da11acaf886baa794790c37d0eb15f70.gif"><br>  And put on a mini shaker.  This is necessary to ensure that all the bubbles come out of the mass, and that it is evenly distributed in shape. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/504/2d8/1ff/5042d81ff4744651ed25be9c14ffb90f.gif"><br>  And now you can put on the chocolate name, picture, nickname, or something else. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/132/850/362/132850362a72eac159731e3898135207.gif"><br>  After this, the future tile is sent to the shock freezing chamber: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fa9/572/709/fa957270911893cac84eec0b774250b5.jpg"><br>  And stays there for a few minutes: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f97/67a/d4b/f9767ad4b9641e5edab1f6ffc8a71db1.jpg"><br></div></div><br><br>  Chocolate is ready: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/17d/9bb/a2f/17d9bba2fa51722b8003e1d13172486b.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Conclusion <br></h4>  This time, unlike <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/madrobots/blog/210370/">GeekPicnic, the</a> organizers worked just fine.  There were stands, there was information on the stands, there was some kind of zoning, there was no terrible hustle around the stands.  I really liked it. <br><br><h4>  Links </h4><br>  <a href="http://3d-expo.ru/ru">Official website of the exhibition</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/makeitlab/blog/212737/">Show Report from MakeItLab</a> <br>  <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/3d/3d-printer-form1/">3D printer FORM 1 on the site Madrobots.ru for 129 990r (pre-order)</a> <br>  <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/3d/3d-printer-buccaneer/">BUCCANEER 3D printer on Madrobots.ru for 29 990r (pre-order)</a> <br>  <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/3d/3doodler-ruchka-dlya-3d-pechati/">3doodler 3d pen on Madrobots.ru for 3 990r (pre-order)</a> <br><br> <a href="https://twitter.com/MadrobotsRu"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac1/fc6/d2a/ac1fc6d2a19948c59791b0da6ab659df.gif"></a> <a href="http://vk.com/madrobots"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/933/ac3/0b6/933ac30b6fd24ffd82218148c2fb0917.gif"></a> <a href="http://instagram.com/madrobotsru"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/464/a82/e04/464a82e045a34bae81406fd0b640cf08.gif"></a> <a href="http://facebook.com/madrobotsrussia"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b5/542/136/0b55421365064901acdf0ed58cc4a111.gif"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63d/405/78e/63d40578ecbf48f28c62f57705c73eb6.gif"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/212831/">https://habr.com/ru/post/212831/</a></p>
