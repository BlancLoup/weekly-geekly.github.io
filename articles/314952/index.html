  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why the ‚Äúmotivating‚Äù articles do not work, do not work and how the motivation really works</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many people like to read motivating articles like "30 ways to make yourself work."  Yes, and many people love to write.  But what many do not like is to write about the fact that the advice given in these articles did not work for them.  That is, some reasonable advice.  And they often try to apply them.  But there is one problem - you should start to apply them, as there is a huge internal resistance.  So much so that it is impossible to apply advice.  So what's the deal? <br><br>  The answer, in fact, is as simple as it is overwhelming - the reason is that we ourselves do not know what we want. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  ‚ÄúBut how?‚Äù - tell me you.  - ‚ÄúWe really want to understand what!  Money, women, health and all such other things!  Are these bad things? ‚Äù

      No, not bad, of course.  But there is a nuance - there is no ‚Äúmoney in general‚Äù, ‚Äúwomen in general‚Äù or ‚Äúhealth in general‚Äù.  As well as there is no ‚Äúsuccess at all‚Äù.  There are concrete achievements.  And they are achieved in concrete ways.  And far from always these achievements and ways are what we really want. <br><br>  Let me explain by example.  So you, for example, have conceived an Internet project.  They sat down, began to design it ... No, they did not.  Send in VK read.  Why? <br><br>  Yes, because you really do not want to do an Internet project.  Well, that is, no, you want, of course.  But not only do you want it.  You still want to be comfortable, for example.  Or you want to relax.  Or security.  And this, by the way, is completely normal.  But you took into account these desires when the project was conceived?  Is it all in it?  Or are you ready to sacrifice all this for the project?  Or not ready? <br><br>  And here it turns out that our real desires are much more complex and diverse than just ‚Äúmaking money‚Äù.  Moreover, it turns out that your desires are contradictory.  At least, they will contradict each other until you figure out how to combine them with each other. <br><br>  No, here, of course, you can lie to yourself.  You can say - "I just do not have enough will."  And what is the will?  The will is to sacrifice one desire in the name of another, more important.  Only then the question arises - what is the desire more important?  What if both are important?  And what if you feel defective without any of them? <br><br>  Oops ... <br><br>  Well, well, well, what then to do?  Well, if the problem is that you yourself do not know what you want, then obviously you need to find out?  But as? <br><br>  Yes, very simple, oddly enough. <br><br>  Look at your whole life.  You've done something all your life.  For something sought.  Something was avoided.  Something you liked.  You didn't like something.  Right? <br><br>  So, ALL THIS is your true desires.  Yes, yes, all this.  Your whole previous life.  Without exceptions and exemptions. <br><br>  And your future life is just the development of the same ‚Äúlike‚Äù and ‚Äúnot like‚Äù that you already had and that you already have. <br><br>  And this is logical.  Is it possible to "invent" a desire or "make yourself" want?  You either want or do not want.  And you can not want what you do not want or want to get what you want. <br><br>  So, the task is to carefully analyze all those desires that you already have and which have already manifested themselves in your life.  In the form of emotions, thoughts or actions.  And build their future activities on the basis of them. <br><br>  And then I will finally answer the question stated in the title of the article about what ‚Äúmotivation‚Äù is.  So, motivation is not about how to ‚Äúforce yourself‚Äù to do something, as they say in all these unfortunate articles.  Motivation is about how to understand exactly what your motives are.  Do not force.  And to understand.  Do you understand? <br><br>  Therefore - do not try to fight with yourself, following the advice of "motivating articles."  It is obviously useless.  Better sit down and think - what do you really want and do not want? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/314952/">https://habr.com/ru/post/314952/</a></p>
