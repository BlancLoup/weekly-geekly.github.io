  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Traffic Inspector 3.0: what's new?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today's review is devoted to the development version of our flagship product.  The beta release will be available on <a href="http://www.smart-soft.ru/">the</a> Smart Software <a href="http://www.smart-soft.ru/">website</a> in May-June, but for now let's briefly go through the list of important innovations that Traffic Inspector 3.0 lacks.  Suffice it to mention the emergence of a special international edition, intended for foreign customers - Russian software developers are now actively exploring global markets and our company is no exception. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>About the product</b> <br>  Traffic Inspector program, popular in the CIS countries, solves all tasks related to safe and efficient user access to the Internet: there is a context-sensitive firewall with advanced features, a simple administration console (which even a novice specialist can handle), a powerful tool <a href="http://www.smart-soft.ru/ru/products/Traffic-Inspector/Features/uchet-trafika/">for traffic analysis</a> and reporting, VPN server, proxy server, virus filtering and spam mail gateway, ad blocking capabilities, channel loading controls and much more.  In addition, the gateway functions are expanded with the help of special modules, and its implementation does not require expensive network equipment. <br><br>  <b>X64 architecture support</b> <br>  In the development process, we took into account the changing needs of users and current market trends.  One of the most important innovations in the third version is the appearance of the Traffic Inspector assemblies for x64 processors.  Disputes about the benefits of such assemblies in specialized forums have been going on for years, many technical specialists still prefer products compiled for i386 - but a modern integrated solution for organizing, controlling and protecting Internet access should take advantage of the processor architecture.  In particular, the ability to address more than 2 GB of memory for one process will make the work of a high-loaded proxy server based on Traffic Inspector more efficient. <br><br>  <b>Deep Packet Inspection</b> <br>  The new filter allows you to extract an arbitrary data block from a network packet, compare it with a specified value (with the possibility of masking to check individual bits) and perform certain actions on the packet.  Such technologies are now actively used in cases where a simple network screen is not enough.  In the future, based on this filter, we will implement the function of blocking Skype and BitTorrent traffic.

      <b>Searches</b> <br>  Search engines have become one of the main means of work in the global network and therefore we include in <a href="http://www.smart-soft.ru/ru/products/Traffic-Inspector/">Traffic Inspector 3.0 the</a> ability to track user requests in Bing, Google, Mail.ru, Rambler, Yahoo and Yandex.  The new magazine will allow you to understand what resources interest the company's employees in the first place and how effectively they use Internet access. <br><br>  <b>New interface</b> <br>  The program interface has been seriously reworked taking into account the wishes of customers - elements of the console tree are now more logical.  The content of the main site pages (‚ÄúObjects‚Äù, ‚ÄúTraffic Accounting‚Äù, ‚ÄúUsers and Groups‚Äù, ‚ÄúRules‚Äù, ‚ÄúServices‚Äù and ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù) has changed completely and now they contain comprehensive information about the settings, as well as links to the main tasks administer the program.  We have also altered the client agent, in general, the appearance of Traffic Inspector has become more modern, and it will be much more convenient to work with it. <br><br>  <b>Administrator Reports and Logs</b> <br>  The Traffic Inspector 3.0 reporting system will allow IT specialists and company management to view data on resources used by employees in a more convenient and clear presentation.  In addition, the program will display a log of administrator actions: with its help, you can track all configuration changes.  Such a tool is indispensable if several people have access to the Traffic Inspector setting. <br><br>  <b>Summary</b> <br>  In the third version, we took into account the requirements of the market for similar products: there will be assemblies for x64, technology of deep inspection of packages and the ability to track user search queries.  In addition, the interface will become more convenient and modern, and the reporting system will be seriously redesigned.  We hope you enjoy this release - it will be available for public beta testing in May-June, about which we will write further. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/177613/">https://habr.com/ru/post/177613/</a></p>
