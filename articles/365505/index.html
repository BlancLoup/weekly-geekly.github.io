Now the court has the right to block not only resources with illegal video production, but also with music, lyrics and software - after the appeal of the copyright holder, of course.  That is, now almost any type of content (except photos) falls under the law.  And besides - and this change is the most important - if the same copyright site again violates the same plaintiff, the resource in punishment will be blocked <b>indefinitely</b> .  As you can see, everything is really serious. <br><br> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/250248/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb6/0d0/270/eb60d0270b5249389e545598f930507e.jpg"></a> <br><br>  As an educational program - this is how this law is being implemented in practice now: 
      <br>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

    <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hidden text</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  After the right holder appeals to the court and confirms the fact of the placement of illegal content, Roskomnadzor immediately contacts the site owner with a request to remove it;  if after that within three days the content is not removed, the authorities will contact the hoster.  If the hoster does not take action, the appeal will follow the provider (which is unlikely to go against the court order).  Blocking a page with content (or the entire site, depending on the situation) will last 15 days, during which the resource owner may file a counterclaim.  And yes, it will still have to remove the content. </div></div><br>  Not only trackers and versioners, but also music search aggregators, as well as the Vkontakte people love, can be under the impact of a toughened law.  Something will go to foreign servers (which, however, does not hurt to block access to them from the Russian Federation), something will go where the ICQ is now and the modem, something will be redeployed or (as is now Odnoklassniki ) license posted content.  And, most likely, the last way will go a few. <br><br>  Thus, the relevance of the issue, where you can get the content legally, gets up to its full height.  In addition, the mass use of pirated content in our country is developed not so much because of greed or lack of funds, but because of the unwillingness to waste time and nerves to get licensed games, music and movies.  If users are available convenient platforms with legal content, then without any anti-piracy law they will be in demand.  And fortunately, there are such platforms in Runet. <br><br>  In our article we will look at where, at a distance of a couple of clicks and without unnecessary trouble, you can listen to copyrighted music for free or for reasonable money.  At once we will make a reservation - it will be a question only of the largest resources having Russian-language interfaces. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">LastFM</font> </h2><br>  The first, perhaps, is to consider the good old <a href="http://lastfm.ru/">LastFM</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fc6/378/eb4/fc6378eb478b49a9a5ba77d487d7d4e3.png"><br><br>  Yes, yes, LastFM.  Now it is certainly not as popular as it used to be, and it seems to be used more as a database of information about groups and performers and as a community of music lovers than as a radio station and content storage.  Nevertheless, there are really a lot of free tracks loaded by the musicians themselves.  It is convenient to get acquainted with, so to speak, the best of any group, especially if you are used to paying for music, but do not want to take the cat in a bag.  However, it doesn‚Äôt have to use LastFM only for this purpose - it‚Äôs good just as a single set of various functions for the petty joys of a music lover, in particular <a href="http://www.lastfm.ru/help/faq%3Fcategory%3D99">scrobbling</a> and selection of related performers based on it. <br><br>  And to listen to music online, and not only in the format of a random radio, but as you please, one of the best resources in the Russian-speaking segment of the Internet is the Yandex.Music service. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">Yandex.Music</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/638/f76/54e/638f7654ea074eb3b3ef0cab0ff9d6b9.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://music.yandex.ru/">Yandex.Music</a> is not a search engine aggregator (which may be under the impact of an updated anti-piracy law), but a storehouse of music sorted by artist and album.  Completely licensed, just in case, we note.  At the moment there are about 18 million tracks here - more than enough, if you are, of course, not a fan of some, for example, very little-known dark folk like Werra or there Rose Rovine E Amanti.  There is an opportunity to collect personal playlists, listen to mixes-radio, there is a system of recommendations (based on the listened tracks and your profiles on Facebook and VK - however, it is not clear how NM manages to detect them).  In short, there are abundant functions.  There is no only possibility to download tracks to your hard drive - however, with such a completely free set of functions, there is nothing surprising.  By the way, keep in mind that the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dru.yandex.music%26hl%3Dru">mobile application</a> rips off a monthly fee of 169 rubles per month, but it can cache tracks for listening in offline mode.  You can also listen to your music, but for this you will need to install Yandex.Disk. <br><br>  The closest competitor and analogue of Yandex <a href="https://music.google.com/">. Music</a> originally from abroad is the <a href="https://music.google.com/">Google Music</a> cloud player integrated into Google Play.  True, it is already paid. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">Google Play Music</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f0/eb8/95d/7f0eb895df304fa683db74286495d210.png"><br><br>  It's all the same - millions of licensed tracks (including a lot of free ones), radio, recommendations.  But there are also quite significant differences.  First of all, you can upload your own tracks (up to 50 thousand) to the cloud and listen to them without restrictions on your <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/catalog/communicators%3Fsort%3D5%26viewType%3D1%26rec%3Dfalse%26filters%3D5153%253A10158%26brands%3D%26warranties%3D%26shops%3D%26labels%3D%26available%3Dfalse%26reserved%3Dfalse%26suborder%3Dfalse%26superPrice%3Dfalse%26specOffers%3Dfalse">smartphone</a> or via the web interface.  And no one asks where you originally took them :) In addition, the music represented in the system can already be downloaded to your own media.  However, for this you need to buy it separately as Google Play products.  But still there is such an opportunity for those who prefer to keep the music in full offline.  On top of that, you can transfer the library from iTunes to Google Music for free (let's talk about iTunes itself later). <br><br>  Of the minuses, there is a completely dull system of music breakdown by genres (and also often a strange genre definition - for example, the <a href="https://play.google.com/music/listen">latest album</a> In Flames is designated here as progressive metal), a banal selection of recommendations, and a shortage of Russian-language tracks (compared to Yandex). Music). <br><br>  It is worth unlimited use of Google Music 189 rubles per month;  There is a 30-day trial period for review.  Pretty democratic, considering what a wealth of music and convenient features for the money offered.  So, if you are not one of those who are waiting with horror for the world to be captured by Google, feel free to open Google Music and draw up a trial month. <br><br>  The next object of our attention is <a href="http://www.deezer.com/">Deezer</a> , an analogue of the <a href="https://www.spotify.com/">Spotify</a> service (not available in Russia). <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">Deezer</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/963/945/1fc/9639451fc1d2474298b80993263404e1.png"><br><br>  The main advantage of Deezer is that it is easy to handle like a hammer.  Top random radio based on the tracks you listened to (Flow), bottom individual recommendations, on the side of a fixed panel the search form, profile data and player.  Really comfortable and nothing extra.  And it looks stylish. <br><br>  The amount of music here is almost two times higher than in the same Yandex.Music - after all, foreign origin has an effect - 35 million tracks.  In addition, there is an extensive database of lyrics. <br><br>  Deezer is free for computers and tablets, but a paid subscription (199 rubles per month + free trial period for 30 days) gives many good features - the ability to cache tracks to listen offline, import MP3s from your device, and remove ads and improve sound quality.  And yes, it allows you to enjoy all this splendor on your phone - without a paid subscription, only Flow and mixes will be available to you.  By the way, there are virtual gift cards here - they are useful if you want to drag your friends to Deezer. <br><br>  Russian response to Deezer and related sites - <a href="http://zvooq.ru/">Zvooq</a> . <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">Zvooq</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df6/019/8aa/df60198aa315430e9757f1118c0952ac.png"><br><br>  The focus in Zwooq is on randomly generated mixes (‚Äúwaves‚Äù) and on thematic music selections from the editorial staff of the portal and other users.  Selections of jazz, music "on the road", "This day in the history of music" and so on - all this is quite interesting.  Well, just listening to specific artists, too, of course, can be (as well as buying and downloading individual tracks and albums to a computer, like in Google Music).  True, Zvooq can not boast of a normal interface and navigation - everything is too piled up and some functions are difficult to find intuitively.  Portal when scrolling pages also slows down.  This, of course, is a big minus, but I would like to hope that the resource will improve. <br><br>  Zvooq is free, but the functionality of a free subscription is such that you most likely will issue a paid version without hesitation if you like the service.  In addition to the presence of advertising, rewinding tracks is not available in the free Sound, and you can switch them no more than 6 times per hour.  Month of subscription costs 149 rubles in the web interface and 169 in the application on smartphones.  You can also pay immediately six months (799 rubles) and a year of subscription (1499 rubles).  A paid subscription, by the way, will allow you to download tracks to the phone (but only to the phone - to download them to a computer, as already mentioned, you will have to buy them for a fee). <br><br>  For "apple" users, there is a popular <a href="http://www.apple.com/ru/itunes/">iTunes</a> service, with which they are all more or less familiar: at least, without it, you can‚Äôt upload music to a new <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/search%3Fstring%3Dapple%2Biphone%26category%3D80252%26sort%3D5">iPhone</a> . <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">iTunes</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f5f/d0e/1da/f5fd0e1da5104e54a6474df3ffe0581d.png"><br><br>  There is nothing free in iTunes (at least for our lands - in the USA, the Free On iTunes section became available recently with a number of free tracks and TV shows) - this is a store in its pure form.  But the prices here are quite humane (adapted specifically for the Russian market) - the cost per track does not exceed 15 rubles.  This time.  And two - the total amount of music available in iTunes has recently exceeded as many as 43 million songs!  What is nice, while Russian-language music (the quality of which as a whole will be left out of the discussion) is abundant here.  Recommendations, playlists and other standard joys of such services - everything is in iTunes.  There is also a feature in the form of virtual gift cards, like in Deezer. <br><br>  Of the minuses - traditionally ‚Äúapple‚Äù with nothing is incompatible with the encoding format of tracks, in this case, AAC (although not so long ago iTunes still learned to convert music into mass formats, and players on other platforms more or less learned to play AAC).  In addition, the program has a rather inconvenient interface - you just have to get used to it.  Although those who have been with iTunes for a long time are accustomed and do not understand what the problem is, but for beginners it is still difficult to figure it out.  From pluses - it is available both on apple smartphones, and on apple <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/catalog/10098212%3Fsort%3D0%26viewType%3D1%26rec%3Dtrue">computers</a> . <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">What else</font> </h2><br>  Of course, the above case is not limited.  There is a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D0%25B4%25D1%2584%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3">crowdfunding</a> platform with free donations for <a href="http://kroogi.com/">Kroogi</a> musicians, there are Internet radio stations <a href="http://www.piter.fm/">piter.fm</a> and <a href="http://www.moskva.fm/">moskva.fm</a> with archives of free songs that were broadcast (sorry, the player with the "rewind broadcast" broke), there are YouTube channels with licensed clips in high-end (one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/VEVO">VEVO</a> worth).  And if we consider resources without a Russian interface, then one article is not enough - we can immediately mention <a href="https://www.spotify.com/">Spotify</a> , <a href="http://www.jango.com/">Jango</a> , and <a href="http://www.stereomood.com/">Stereomood</a> , and <a href="http://8tracks.com/">8tracks,</a> and much, much more.  And, most likely, in connection with the tightening of the anti-piracy law, we will soon witness the expansion of this market in the Runet, which will lead to the emergence of new streaming services and music repositories.  For now - we study and master the available ones.  Do you know more interesting services?  Write in the comments. <br><br>  For today everything, to be continued.  Next time we will tell you where it is better to hunt for movies and TV shows. <br><br>  <b>PS:</b> If you are suddenly looking for headphones that are inexpensive and pleasant to handle - pay attention to <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/783797">this model</a> , I highly recommend it.  They can sit for hours, they have a surprisingly pleasant sound (for their size and price), and they are not felt on the head.  In general, we have a fairly large selection of audio equipment: there are <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/catalog/headphones%3F">headphones</a> , and <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/catalog/portable_acoustic">portable sound systems</a> and a lot of <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/catalog/hifi_multimedia%3Fsort%3D1">desktop / floor multichannel sets</a> .
