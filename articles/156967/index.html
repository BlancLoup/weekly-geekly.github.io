And, which is extremely rare in our days, it is also a text quest, visually designed to work in the command line on a remote computer - every now and then the status of connecting to proxy servers or testing computer systems flashes on the screen.  In some Western forums, there were even reviews in the spirit of ‚ÄúI opened your link and immediately turned it off, I think I‚Äôm breaking into the Pentagon !!!‚Äù, the alarmist had to reassure and say that this is just a game. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Although, again, taking into account my pedigree, the project was presented by Hide &amp; Seek, people who organized their insane exhibition of "new gaming experience" (if not up to date, read about The Hide &amp; Seek Festival: Social Gaming UK - a very interesting event) - This is not so surprising as it may seem at first glance.  In short, TBIOE does not allow direct control of the character, instead you talk to field agents and help them complete a number of tasks - for example, hide with valuable data from the villains or track down an important arms dealer.  In a couple of moments that struck me separately, I even had to take quite serious morally decisions that I really thought about.  The most pleasant and surprising thing about TBIOE is that the agents do not create the complete illusion of communication with a living person, but they are very convincing in this most of the time. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3d1/7bc/1a0/3d17bc1a00222d0f5cda20d85c56bde9.png"></a> <br>  <i>Most of the time, the player will spend reading the text, but at times agents send different pictures, be it a photograph of a bomb or a floor plan.</i>

      And it happens, as it seems to me because of the following small details.  Agents do not respond immediately, it seems that they are really typing the answer - which creates a sense of real dialogue.  At times they make dark jokes, express their fears and fears, as a result in many moments, for example, when the timer on the bio-bomb counts down, and we frantically go through the options of our actions, it is very easy to forget that in fact the communication does not occur another person, but with a soulless machine. <br><br>  So, despite the fact that the agents are largely faceless - their biography is unknown, not to mention the names, I began to worry about them in a strange way.  When one of them with my help escaped certain death, and then he thanked me for saving me for a long time, I smiled like an idiot.  It was a very strange moment - at least because I successfully convinced someone that I was really an expert in the neutralization of explosive devices and that I could completely trust in this matter, although I acted, frankly, at random. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dc6/975/d69/dc6975d69b9ff9b8d08895ac9d743532.png"></a> <br>  <i>The game is available only in English - given the powerful enough semantic analyzer, a good half of the code would have to be rewritten for translation into other languages.</i> <br><br>  Or, for example, after the very first passage of the very first mission, this blond bitch from MI6, whose elastic ass I just saved from five pursuers (nothing about the hair color and loin in the game, but the text quests are good - the imagination draws itself picture), she nodded on duty and expressed her dissatisfaction with the death of the bad guys - there would be nobody to interrogate the authorities.  I had to replay and act a little more sophisticated way.  Actually, at such moments you understand how important such seemingly trifles are for the game. <br><br>  Everything is not so perfect, of course, sometimes there are failures, as a rule, due to the imperfection of the game engine.  So, I lost the agent because I tried to rephrase the previous sentence, the meaning of which he did not understand.  Seconds before death, they wrote to me: ‚ÄúUm, could you suggest something soon?‚Äù  And I told you what to do, you moron, so who died now ?!  Arrr! <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4b3/6b8/94d/4b36b894d5e06d8a74e4240a71662894.png"></a> <br>  <i>To complete the task as ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù, you have to use the Sony technique that is available from the agent.</i>  <i>Which is understandable, after all, a promotional game.</i> <br><br>  In general, this is a very pleasant, high-quality experiment, which I strongly recommend to read, at least, because I suggest you to BUY SONY VAIO PHONE SONY XPERIA TABLET SONY SONY SONY, uhm, sorry.  This is the side effect of TBIOE, I think you will very quickly understand what I meant when you start playing. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/10/24/here-is-a-natural-language-james-bond-text-adventure/">Original post</a> . <br><br>  <b>PS The</b> new James Bond Skyfall Coordinates is now in the box office, and this film is worth seeing on the big screen.  Well, the owners of Sony smartphones will be pleased to see familiar models on the screen, for example, in a scene where M is talking on the phone, on which a transparent strip of one of the NXT-series models is flashing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/156967/">https://habr.com/ru/post/156967/</a></p>
