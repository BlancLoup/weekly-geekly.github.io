I do not forget about my promise to tell you more about the internal structure of Wikipedia and the Wikimedia Foundation, but today we would like to share another good news. <br><br>  Starting today, the first resident wiki has appeared in Russia.  A resident wiki is a full-time employee of a third-party organization who uploads materials created and owned by a third-party organization into Wikimedia projects and receives a salary for it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  How will this work? </h4><br>  The first (and, I hope, not the last) partner of Wikimedia RU was ‚ÄúBusiness Magazine‚Äù, in the staff list of which a new position appeared - ‚ÄúWikimedia‚Äù (in other words, resident wiki).  An active Wikipedia participant <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Gipoza">Sergey Zhuravel</a> was recruited as a resident wiki, who will use a separate <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A3%25D1%2587%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA:Kelatrat">Kelatrat</a> account to separate edits made as part of his official duties and during his normal participation in Wikipedia.

      Since the materials uploaded to Wikipedia must comply with the requirements of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license</a> , or another freer license, Business Journal has <a href="http://b-mag.ru/legal/">issued a separate notice</a> that these materials will be transferred to the <a href="">public domain</a> .  This means that anyone can freely use, modify, distribute materials published in this project for any purpose. <br><br><h4>  Why do we think this is so important? </h4><br>  First of all, this is our first such agreement with a media representative about publishing materials on free licenses by the publication itself.  We really hope that sending this experience will allow us to be more successful in future negotiations with potential partners. <br><br>  Secondly, Business Journal is one of the most popular Russian business publications of recent years with a monthly circulation of about 100 thousand copies, and its connection to our idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdisseminating free knowledge is undoubted success. <br><br>  Thirdly, cooperation with archives, libraries, museums, galleries and media is one of the priorities of the Wikimedia Foundation and all regional offices.  But more about this - just below. <br><br><h4>  Background and World Experience </h4><br>  The project to build partnerships with cultural institutions was named GLAM (abbreviated galleries, libraries, archives, museums), and it was initially launched in the UK.  Now the project has expanded considerably, many countries participate in it, a large number of museums, libraries, archives and media resources, and this is understandable: millions of people view Wikipedia daily, 30 million articles are available in 287 languages, and it is Wikipedia that allows our potential partners to bring information about yourself, about your collections and funds to a wide audience.  At the same time, becoming a full-fledged and active participant in Wikipedia is not always easy, especially for older people, who are usually museum workers, cultural figures and other professionals.  The combination of participants familiar with the themes and principles of participation in Wikipedia, and employees of cultural institutions with deep knowledge, but not previously familiar with editing articles, just allows you to get mutual benefits. <br><br>  The first experience was the British Museum: in 2010, resident wiki Liam Wyatt for 5 weeks, loaded the materials of the museum in Wikipedia and improved relations with the museum staff.  Later, the resident wiki worked in <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9_%25D0%2598%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0">the Indianapolis Children's Museum</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C">Versailles</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D1%2583%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9_%25D0%259F%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE_%2528%25D0%2591%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%2529">the Picasso Museum</a> and other institutions.  In the end, <a href="https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikipedian_in_Residence">about 60 organizations</a> took part in the project, with more than 30 of them having resident wikis even now. <br><br><h4>  Problems </h4><br>  Wikimedia RU has previously entered into agreements with museums and various publications (for example, they received materials from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Wiki%25D0%2593%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0">Ekho Moskvy, the Russian State Archive of Phonodocuments</a> , <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Pereslavl_Week/ru">the Pereslavskaya Nedelya newspaper</a> , <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:RIA_Novosti">and RIA Novosti news agency</a> ), but in general I can highlight two problems: <br><br><ul><li>  due to the lack of funding, Russian museums, archives and libraries are more concerned with survival than with expanding access to their collections, accessing the Internet, and mass digitization of funds; </li><li>  many believe that it is not necessary to engage in such activities, since it cannot bring benefits and profits. </li></ul><br>  I do not think that our organization is able to cope with the first problem, but the solution to the second problem is in our hands.  For example, in the case of Business Journal, it was helped by the fact that the new CEO of the publication, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A3%25D1%2587%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA:Kalashnov">Yuri Kalashnov,</a> is an active participant in Wikipedia, and he sincerely believes that today we need to think about ways to avoid paper media and stimulate the transition to electronic publishing. .  In many other cases, everything also began with a personal acquaintance of someone from the participants of Wikipedia. <br><br>  Therefore, we, as in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/wikimedia_ru/blog/216463/">our first post</a> , are looking for helpers and like-minded people: if you have acquaintances in museums, the media, etc., tell them about Wikipedia and the benefits of free information and interest them.  If you have any questions or need advice and help, feel free <a href="https://ru.wikimedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0:%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%258B">to write to us</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/222751/">https://habr.com/ru/post/222751/</a></p>
