  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mitap Haskell programmers at Kaspersky Lab (in the sense of - waiting)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A year and a half ago, adherents of functional programming founded the RuHaskell community and since then periodically gather and conduct mitapes.  Well, how periodically - already gathered twice.  We here, at Kaspersky Lab, generally support this initiative very much.  Firstly, because it‚Äôs interesting, secondly, because we use Haskell in the process of developing our solutions, and thirdly, because some members of the community work with us.  That is why we decided to collect the third mitap of this community on our territory.  On August 18, all those interested can come to our Moscow office (Leningradskoye Shosse, 39A, p.2), listen to smart people, discuss Haskell, share experiences, ask questions and talk.  Of course, you should first register here on <a href="https://laboratoriya-kasperskogo.timepad.ru/event/356321/">this page</a> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/803/811/2d6/8038112d68b041c3a5612d40a097de3c.png"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So far, we have four reports in our plans.  The first is planning to speak Pavel Filonov, our research developer.  In March of this year, when the release of the GCC 6.1 open source compiler kit was released, which specifically added support for extending the C ++ Concepts template system, Pavel closely followed the presentations, reviews and articles on this topic.  Often the authors of these speeches were asked the same question: ‚ÄúC ++ Concepts is the same as Haskell type classes?‚Äù But Paul did not hear a direct answer to this question, and therefore he tried to find out everything himself.  And since he adheres to the philosophy of ‚Äúif you want to figure out something, try to explain it,‚Äù he decided to devote his speech to this very topic. <br><br>  In the process of preparing for the report, Pavel understood that in order to answer this question, one had to dig deeper into the topic.  As a result, he had to process a huge amount of materials (he promised to share with links).  Because if classes of types are known and applied for a long time, then C ++ concepts are a new thing.  And Paul plans to talk about what problem they solve, how they look and how to work with them.  Well, to explain, finally, what they have in common with classes of types and what are their differences.

      The second speaker, Yuri Syrovetsky, is also a developer from Kaspersky Lab.  He is one of those people who use functional programming in their daily work.  Yuri promises to tell why we started to hire Haskell-programmers and how we use this language to create high-performance programs.  Taking into account that traditionally functional programming is considered not very popular in the industry, the report promises to be interesting. <br><br>  In particular, Yuri promises to consider in detail several tools used in our company for solving code generation problems.  In particular, the language-with and Ivory libraries.  He will compare them and show the strengths and weaknesses of each of these tools.  The second tool is especially interesting here, because not so much documentation is available on it.  Ivory created in Galois Inc.  and do not apply outside almost anywhere except here.  Maybe it is because very few people outside Galois understand how it works.  So Yury decided to share his experience, tell about what he and his colleagues learned in practice.  He promises to provide examples of code, including quite complex ones. <br><br>  The third speaker, Alexey Pirogov, promises to consider in his speech another functional programming language - Elm.  And consider it as a phenomenon.  Alexey is fascinated by this language and its ecosystem.  After all, the author released not only the compiler, but also the package manager, and the build system, that is, he created a complete ecosystem.  In addition, the compiler can produce detailed and detailed, but concise messages.  As a result, even a person who is not familiar with the language can master it very quickly and comfortably.  In other words, Aleksey considers Elm to be an excellent example of how to make a programming language as a product now: so that it attracts an audience, but at the same time that people do not leave, having stuffed the first bump. <br><br>  The last speaker is Nikolai Kudasov, technical director of GetShopTV (where, by the way, the entire server part is implemented in Haskell).  His speech is intended mainly for beginners who would like to get acquainted with the language of Haskell (which he, incidentally, also teaches at the faculty of the VMC of Moscow State University).  Nikolai always believed that the best way to learn any programming language is to write a simple toy.  Therefore, using the example of developing a simple multiplayer online game from scratch, he decided to explain how to organize a project in Haskell, split tasks into server, client and logical parts, how web sockets are used, and so on.  Nikolai also promises to acquaint the audience with the organization of the project with the help of Stack and Cabal, and with libraries gloss, servant, binary, stm. <br><br>  For those who can not get to the event, we plan to conduct an online broadcast on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/KasperskyChannelRU">Youtube channel</a> .  Once again - you can register for the event on <a href="https://laboratoriya-kasperskogo.timepad.ru/event/356321/">this page</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/307764/">https://habr.com/ru/post/307764/</a></p>
