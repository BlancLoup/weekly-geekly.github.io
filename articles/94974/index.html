"And I am about your publication on habrahabr" - great.  They asked "oh, and what happened to you" - the question is obviously stupid - you read everything.  ‚ÄúTell me exactly how you were insulted‚Äù - even more stupid request, to which I replied that I did not want to repeat what she said.  After that, an employee of something there in Privat said ‚Äúbut in your publication you were not shy‚Äù - this already completely freaked out.

      From the payload they asked to clarify exactly when the incident occurred, from which number they called and similar information. <br><br>  They promised to conduct an investigation and punish all the guilty.  And call me back.  Two weeks later, it seems. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Then the fun begins <habracut><br><br><h4>  Funny begins </h4><br>  After a time, they called back. <br><br>  You know, we have now received your complaint, but so many calls arrive on the line that we didn‚Äôt look for yours, because it‚Äôs a waste of time (I asked you, ‚Äúwhat, your customers don't get the opinion?‚Äù, But he replied, "do not reinterpret my words").  And in general, it was a long time ago, and I had to leave a complaint (which I unsuccessfully 2 times did). <br><br>  Therefore, we, of course, will undertake something there, and then we will call you again. <br><br><h4>  The funny thing </h4><br>  After a while, they really called back.  Twice.  From different numbers. <br><br>  <b>First call</b> <br>  Yes, you know, since January 2009, there was an order for a bank, according to which everyone who re-issued a card is required to force and force another one - a piggy bank, and it does not matter how many piggy banks you already have. <br><br>  Here you need to pause, and go back 10 months ago, when everything happened.  It was then that I called for support and they clearly and clearly told me that I was not obliged to take a card, and then I also learned that they are all given a load, because for them the salary bonuses go. <br><br>  I objected to Privatbank‚Äôs employee there, having noticed that it was then that he received other information, and he began to assure me that there could not even be other information (and I, it turns out, is sclerotic and don‚Äôt remember anything?). <br><br>  But they fired someone from the support service.  I asked to send me an official paper, that there was a complaint and, according to the results, such and such measures were taken.  I was told that since the complaint had not been filed in writing, this could not be done. <br><br>  <b>Second call (on the same day)</b> <br>  Here, we call you from the office on the street.  Lazaryan, 2. We received your complaint and dismissed an employee who was rude to you and forced you to take an extra card, but this could not be done. <br>  Here it becomes ridiculous to me, because two different people from the same bank tell me two diametrically opposite things and at the same time they say that it cannot be otherwise. <br>  At the end of this call, of course, I ask you to send me a paper officially confirming that in response to my complaint such an employee was dismissed.  Answer that okay, no question.  I ask when to wait.  Answered that a maximum of 30 days.  Recorded my mailing address. <br><br><h4>  A curtain </h4><br>  It took more than 2 months.  No paper came. <br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br>  Almost a year has passed since the incident. <br>  During this time, 2 complaints were filed, none of which had any reaction. <br>  During this time, there were about 10 calls, which also did not produce any useful effect. <br><br>  It remains only to note that Privatbank is still at one of the last places in the ratings of banks of Ukraine in terms of customer service quality. <br><br>  And I‚Äôll come back tomorrow and see if the employee, who was fired 2 months ago, is still working? </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94974/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94974/</a></p>
