  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Two days of events for developers in Yekaterinburg</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The other day, on December 15 and 16, events for developers and IT specialists of all kinds of occupations took place in Yekaterinburg.  All events were held at the Ural State University (Ural State University). <br><br>  Firstly, <a href="http://www.skbkontur.ru/">SKB Kontur</a> organized a free lecture by the well-known agile-development specialist <a href="http://urazbaev.moikrug.ru/">Askhat Urazbayev</a> .  The topic of the lecture was called ‚Äú <strong>Flexible methodologies for building an effective software development team</strong> ‚Äù and covered the principles of creating a good team and how flexible methodologies help to do this. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Askhat described in detail the problems in the organization of software development and explained why and how agile-methodologies can help in solving them.  A lot of examples were considered and specific scrum practices were presented.  Despite the cold of ‚Äì30 degrees and rather late in time, the lecture gathered a lot of people and in my opinion was extremely successful.  Personally, I did not work with agile and I was extremely curious to know how agile and scrum work and what they can give. <br><br>  After the lecture of Askhat, a meeting of the <strong>Ural .NET User Group</strong> was held, which was held in the same building as the lecture, one floor below.  It so happened that instead of the planned two reports at the meeting there was only one report and I spoke with him.  I do not dare to evaluate my performance, but I tried in an hour of time to tell the most complete about the numerous innovations in <strong>ASP.NET 4.0</strong> .  The meeting was attended by a guest from Microsoft - Roman Zdebsky, who after my report was asked questions about WPF.

      In addition, I post the slides of my presentation and source codes of the demonstrations.  Download <a href="">from here</a> (pptx / ppt + zip). <br><br>  On the second day, yesterday, December 16, another <strong>TechDays</strong> event took place, which Microsoft holds twice a year across the country.  The event, as usual, was divided into two parts: TechNet and DevDays for IT professionals and developers, respectively. <br><br>  The main and only TechNet speaker was <strong>Andrei Beshkov, a</strong> specialist from Microsoft.  Those who have been to Andrei‚Äôs reports know that he is a very competent speaker who is very pleasant and interesting to listen to.  Reports on TechNet were on the following topics: <ul><li>  <strong>What's new in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2</strong> is an introductory report describing a significant number of architectural changes in new operating systems.  If you were tormented or tormented by the question ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs new in Windows 7,‚Äù you could get the answer on this report. </li><li>  <strong>BranchCache technology-based branch network optimization ‚Äî the</strong> second report was devoted to a very interesting Microsoft development, which is a distributed (or centralized) cache in a remote office for caching and significantly speeding up access to data using HTTP (S) and SMB protocols.  In general, the system resembles a local branch-level peer-to-peer network in which data can be taken not from the head office, but from the nearest computer over the local network.  All this is most protected and productive.  The thing is cool and, as Andrey showed, the demonstration is easy to set up, but it works efficiently. </li><li>  <strong>DirectAccess: A secure corporate network without borders - the</strong> last third report was about VPN killer ‚Äî DirectAccess technology that allows you to connect to your company's local network without VPN and much easier VPN.  DirectAccess works through any provider that does not have access to HTTPS.  Andrew showed a number of significant advantages of DirectAccess over VPN, ease of setup, and spoke about his experience in using technology.  I got the feeling that the VPN is soon waiting for the dying out as a class and DirectAccess, with the spread of Win7 / Server2008 R2 will be implemented everywhere. </li></ul>  DevDays - the second part of the TechDays event was dedicated to software development.  There were two speakers - Marat Bakirov and Roman Zdebsky - both representatives of Microsoft and software development specialists.  The topics of the reports were as follows: <ul><li>  Introductory report <strong>Microsoft Technologies for developers: The present and the future</strong> read Roman.  In it, he spoke about the latest trends in software development on the Microsoft platform, news and announcements that have occurred over the past six months.  For example, Roman mentioned the announcements from the PDC conference.  In general, in the introductory report a huge part of the whole Microsoft technologies stack was reviewed.  And if someone didn‚Äôt know something or missed the news lately, he could learn a lot from the report. </li><li>  <strong>Overview of Visual Studio 2010 - a</strong> more substantive report by Marat Bakirov was devoted just to the latest release of the most popular software development environment.  New Visual Studio tools were reviewed, what they give, why they were made, and how to use them.  If you have not yet read Visual Studio 2010 Beta 2, then it‚Äôs time to do it, because you can already develop commercial applications on it. </li><li>  The last third report, titled <strong>Features for Windows 7 for Developers,</strong> was also read by Marat.  In it, he explained visually with examples what is new in Windows 7 for the developer, how to implement this new in projects and most importantly, why it is necessary to support the new Windows 7 functions in their applications.  Marat emphasized that the convenience of many innovations of Windows 7 will make your application more user-friendly and the introduction of support for such functions will bring you a competitive edge.  Particularly interesting was the part devoted to the implementation of multi touch technology, which, as was shown, you can add support to your WPF application with just ten lines of code. </li></ul>  In general, TechNet / DevDays events were a success this time.  Considering the fact that yesterday the weather in Yekaterinburg was ‚Äì30 degrees plus wind, the attendance did not decrease and was high.  Obviously, the relevance of such events is very high and if you still do not visit them, then ask, maybe TechDays is also held in your city. <br><br>  The last two days were very useful, a lot of material, reports, speeches, communication with people.  I think that the developers from Yekaterinburg and the surrounding area should have been satisfied.  If you live in Yekaterinburg, and still do not participate in such events, then welcome: come, listen, speak, communicate with interesting people and guests. <br><br>  It was cool! <br><br>  PS: thanks to SKB Kontur and Microsoft for organizing great lectures and events. <br><br> <a href="http://progg.ru/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D1%258F-%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9-%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D1%2587%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2-%25D0%25B2-%25D0%2595%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B1%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2585%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580"><img alt="Progg it" src="http://progg.ru/image.axd?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhabrahabr.ru%2Fblogs%2Fdevelopment%2F78519%2F"></a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78519/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78519/</a></p>
