Jobs letter</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h5>  In October 2010, Steve Jobs sent an email to Phil Schiller (Apple's senior vice president of marketing) with the topic Top 100 - A.  The letter contained a plan for a top-secret meeting called ‚ÄúTop 100,‚Äù which was to be held in early 2011. </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13b/ef8/678/13bef8678780c77cff8b884a3d8499cc.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Meetings of the "Top 100" are important events at Apple.  In 2011, CNN was <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/08/25/how-apple-works-inside-the-worlds-biggest-startup/">told</a> what this meeting is, and how it all happens there ... Now <a href="http://filegiver.com/">we are</a> sharing this information with Habr. <br>  There is a small group of employees at Apple who met with Steve.  It's called the Top 100, and every year or so Jobs gathered these favorites for three days intensively regarding the company's strategy in a safe, unknown place.  Everything connected with the Top 100 meeting, as well as its existence, is shrouded in mystery.  Those who participated were strongly advised not to add this event to their calendar.  The participant must completely deny his connection with such an event, even when discussing within the company.  Those invited were forbidden to come to the meeting place on their own car, instead they had to catch buses that run from Cupertino (Apple headquarters) to places like the luxurious Chaminade Resort &amp; Spa in Santa Cruz, which met two main requirements Jobs: good food and no golf.  Apple carefully chose the site, checking conference rooms for bugs or other listening equipment. <br><br>  The Top 100 meeting was an important management tool for Jobs.  He and his chief assistants used the meeting to inform the tops about where the company is strategically moving.  This event also gave Jobs the opportunity to share his global plan with the new generation of Apple leaders.  Jobs focused on personalities.  Each session was created according to the same rules as the world-famous presentations of Apple products, which were held by Steve.  For the speakers, the career rates were extremely high, as was the pressure on the nerves.  ‚ÄúThe Top 100 meeting was the most terrible event in life for about 10 speakers.  For the remaining 90, this is the best few days of their life, ‚Äùrecalls one of the former vice-presidents, who also spoke on the stage a few years ago.  Jobs sometimes used meetings to present the company's most important initiatives to the hundreds of favorites.  ‚ÄúI was on Top 100 when Steve showed us the iPod.  Except for us, absolutely no one knew about the iPod, ‚Äùsays Mike Janes, who worked at Apple from 1998 to 2003 and remains close to the leadership of Apple. <br><br>  To be among those invited to the "Top 100", the participant had to be approved personally by Steve Jobs, and the position of the invited person did not have much importance.  ‚ÄúMy job is to cooperate with the top 100 best employees of the company, and not just with the vice-presidents.  Some of them are simply key figures in the company that generate certain ideas that I can spread to the whole hundred, ‚ÄùJobs <a href="http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2008/fortune/0803/gallery.jobsqna.fortune/7.html">told</a> Fortune in 2008 in <a href="http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2008/fortune/0803/gallery.jobsqna.fortune/7.html">an interview</a> .  In private conversations, Jobs gave the top 100 even more importance.  If Steve had to create some new company, he would bring these 100 people with him.

      <br>
      And yet, contrary to the existence of one hundred favorites, Apple did not have a caste system.  A one-time invitation to the "Top 100" did not mean that you were there forever.  By decision of Jobs, the list of participants changed from year to year, and it is quite humiliating to be expelled from this elite club.  For those who stayed in Cupertino, chatter and gossip began exactly at the very moment when the elect left.  Employees who prepared the top hundred arranged such a ‚Äúlunch of the worst hundred‚Äù to discuss the news. <br><br>  Below is Jobs 'new letter, which became publicly available in a lawsuit between Apple and Samsung, although it appears as the defendant‚Äôs application marked ‚Äú <i>Highly Confidential - Attorneys' Eyes Only</i> ‚Äù (strictly confidential, only for lawyers).  Given the level of secrecy of these meetings, "Top 100" and the fact that 2011 was the last for Jobs at Apple, this letter deserves special attention. <br><br><blockquote>  From: Steve Jobs <br>  Date: October 24, 2010 6:12:41 PM <br>  To: ET <br>  Topic: Top 100 - A <br><br>  Here is my current plan.
