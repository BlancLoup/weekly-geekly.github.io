      Today, most of the time is spent on managing projects for automating the company's business processes and developing software.  In an emergency, you have to do almost everything. <br><br>  <b>One word that best describes how you work:</b> <br><br>  Professionally. <br><br>  <b>How many hours a day do you spend on work?</b> <br><br>  On average, 10-16 hours.  Peaks are up to 20 hours. <br><br>  <b>How many hours do you sleep?</b> <br><br>  I try to sleep at least five hours in a row. <br><br>  <b>How do you have breakfast?</b> <br><br>  I have breakfast quickly.  Breakfast is like a loose lunch.  Be sure to have a good tea. <br><br>  <b>What are you doing on the way to / from work?</b> <br><br>  Since I get to work by car, my hands and eyes are busy driving.  There are ears through which I try to get the necessary information.  Audio content is different and depends on the circumstances.  As a rule, this information helps in the work. <br><br>  <b>What kind of todo-manager do you use personally?</b> <br><br>  Outlook. <br><br>  <b>What applications and services can't you do without?</b> <br><br>  Any software has an alternative, you can do almost everything.  But in any case, something must provide communication.  The main tools for me are Outlook, JIRA, Redmine and Mantis. <br><br>  <b>What kind of task manager / issue tracker / repository do you use in the company?</b> <br><br>  We use Redmine, but from the new year we are starting to switch to JIRA.  As a repository we use Git.  For one project, Mantis is historically used. <br><br>  <b>What other tools and software do you use at work?</b> <br><br>  MS Visual Studio 15 Community edition;  MS SQL Server 2014, 2016;  MS Build;  ReSharper 2016;  TeamCity 10. <br><br>  <b>Does the company have internal projects?</b> <br><br>  Yes, we have a number of projects to automate the company's business processes. <br><br>  <b>What annoys you most when you work?</b> <br><br>  Most of all, nothing annoys me.  I am not an irritable person and will adapt to an irritant in case of anything. <br><br>  <b>What professional literature would you recommend?</b> <br><br>  I would recommend to read the book of Yitzhak K. Adizes <a href="https://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/27224180/">"The management of the life cycle of corporations</a> . <a href="https://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/27224180/">"</a> <br><br>  <b>What do you prefer: electronic reading rooms or paper books?</b> <br><br>  Paper books are more pleasant, but electronic ones are more convenient.  I read more electronic options - buy faster and start reading. <br><br>  <b>What technique and why do you prefer at work and at home?</b> <br><br>  Today everything is so unified that there is no point in sticking to any brand.  I choose on the basis of ergonomic and technical properties.  I also have a working VDI, and mail is available as a web application, so there are no big restrictions on working with any device.  I think a modern company is committed to such a model. <br><br>  <b>What do you listen when you work?</b> <br><br>  I rarely listen to anything while working.  But sometimes for a mood of work, when you need to do something volumetric, you can turn on something.  It can be any genre of music: from metal to meditation music, depends on the task and mood. <br><br>  <b>Which life hack allows you to be more efficient?</b> <br><br>  Sports activities.  Well help to switch the body to another type of load, and when you return to work, much of the problem becomes clear. <br><br>  <b>What kind of professional advice for the future can you give yourself?</b> <br><br>  Do not delay, do it! <br><br>  <b>What would you recommend to a person trying to go the same way?</b> <br><br>  Vladimir Vysotsky has long and clearly answered this question.  A little paraphrase I say: this is someone else‚Äôs rut, friend.  Find your way. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/323130/">https://habr.com/ru/post/323130/</a></p>
