  <section class="page js-page"><h1>April 8 - learn everything about the Microsoft Azure cloud in one cloudy day</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Friends!  Around us are more and more computer systems and services operating on the Internet that must interact with millions of users.  Ensuring such a high load, fault tolerance and reliability was made possible through the use of cloud technologies.  It can be expected that in a few years the vast majority of web systems will work in the cloud, and current students and schoolchildren will be faced with the need to program portals and services for working in the cloud. <br><br>  We offer all students and schoolchildren to get acquainted with what cloud technology is in one day and try out various Microsoft Azure cloud scenarios in practice - from creating a website to hosting a Minecraft server virtual machine to machine learning tasks. <br><br> <a href="https://events.techdays.ru/Cloud-Day/2016-04/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb0/458/885/fb0458885b694f9186f2e8ad00027b3c.png"></a>

      As part of the cloudy day, which will be held on April 8, 2016, you will receive a promotional code to use all the features of Microsoft Azure during the month.  We will present to your attention a set of lectures and practical tasks, having completed which you will not only get acquainted with the basic capabilities of the cloud, but also receive a virtual certificate from the cloud guru.  You <a href="https://events.techdays.ru/Cloud-Day/2016-04/apply">must first register</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Detailed schedule of a cloudy day is <a href="https://events.techdays.ru/Cloud-Day/2016-04/">given on the website</a> .  You can see only the reports you are interested in, or spend the whole day and learn everything about the cloud.  Each report will include a small introductory part with a demonstration, after which you will have some time to independently perform the proposed tasks and ask questions.  Throughout the day, my colleagues and I will be available online to help you complete tasks and understand cloud technologies. <br><br>  The first report will begin at 10:00 Moscow time.  We will explain why it is important to pay attention to cloud technologies, what is their main difference from regular hosting, and what features Microsoft Azure provides to the developer and administrator.  In the course of this report, we will show how to register a free trial cloud account, which you will need to perform the remaining tasks, as well as help in case of problems. <br><br>  Next, we will teach you to create virtual machines in the cloud - you will learn how to create remote servers running Windows and Linux in the cloud, and even deploy various software on them.  As an example, we will create our Minecraft server running Ubuntu Server. <br><br>  Next, we will consider the creation of web sites - from the simplest web pages to ready-made content management systems and programming of their web applications using PHP or ASP.NET.  In addition, we will teach you to deploy SQL Server in the DBMS cloud and work with the simplest SQL queries, as well as talk about machine learning and data mining.  A few more topics are currently being worked out, so interesting additions to the program are possible! <br><br>  We look forward to seeing you on a cloudy day!  Do not forget <a href="https://events.techdays.ru/Cloud-Day/2016-04/apply">to register in advance</a> before March 31, since  The number of promotional codes for free use of all cloud features is limited, and they will be distributed in the order received. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/279793/">https://habr.com/ru/post/279793/</a></p>
