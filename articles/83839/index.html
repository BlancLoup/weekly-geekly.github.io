As it turned out, for Ukraine it takes up to 2 months and with running around back and forth. <br>  Continued under the cut <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I'll start from the beginning. <br><br><h4>  Adsense </h4><br>  Of course, I‚Äôll skip that moment with the settings, but I‚Äôll move on to the point where it‚Äôs about money. <br>  And so, on the balance of $ 10 +, the system asks to confirm the address, for this we go to the <b>Payment History - Enter the pin-code - Request a new PIN</b> . <br>  After about 7-10 days I received a letter <br><img src="http://img30.imageshack.us/img30/4402/adsn.png" alt="image"><br>  entered the PIN and continued to wait for the withdrawal limit of $ 100. <br>  This day has arrived, the system has notified that the money has been sent;  5-7 days passed and a green check with green money appeared on my hands :) <br>  Well now it would be necessary to cash it, not to put it in a frame. <br>  Climbing on the Internet and reading about all the banks and their work with Google Ads and PayPal, I stopped at PrivatBank. <br><br><h4>  PrivatBank </h4><br>  I take the check, passport, IIN and go to the first branch PrivatBank.  They tell me that in each city there is only one place where it can be cashed, and in Kharkov it is the PrivatBank office at 16 Krasnoshkolnaya Embankment Street. <br>  He came to this department, found a department where it can be turned. <br>  I begin to communicate with a bank employee (I, S - employee): <br>  I - Good afternoon, is it possible to cash a check of a European bank <br>  C - Yes, give your credit card <br>  I * give my card <br>  C - this is not suitable, you need a secondary map <br>  I * hell <br>  I'm fine, I need the cheapest card with the ability to pay via the Internet, how much does it cost? <br>  C - Visa Clasic $ 10 <br>  I - I can definitely pay through the Internet? <br>  C - yes 
      <br>

      <br>
      Filled all the documents, gave the money for the card and check. <br><br><h5>  Now the most important thing !!! </h5><br>  When you return the check, you need to sign on it in the rectangle from behind. <br>  After that, give the bank employee and wait until he prints a receipt that the bank took the check itself.  If he does not give anything, ask yourself, because this is the only evidence that you have given a check for cashing! <br><br>  I continue the conversation with the bank employee (I, S - employee): <br>  I - When will the card? <br>  From - in 10 days <br>  I - when will the money? <br>  From - in 35-40 days <br>  I * 0_o <br>  Why me? <br>  With a registered letter, a request is sent to the bank in which the check was issued to check the validity, it takes up to 40 days. <br>  I - what are you sending him to pigeons? <br>  WITH - ‚Ä¶ <br><br>  Damn, new technologies, Internet, etc. and etc., and they carry out these operations by mail, as it turned out, Sberbank and UkrSib Bank also do%) ... I do not understand ... <br><br>  It took 10 days, went to pick up the card. <br>  I begin to communicate with a bank employee (I, S - employee): <br>  I - you can pick up a card <br>  C - yes <br>  I * took the card <br>  Am I sure I can pay off on the Internet? <br>  C - yes <br><br>  Another month passed and the money came to the card. <br>  Well, I think I‚Äôm going to attach PayPal and buy on eBay, what I have wanted for a long time <br>  * I‚Äôll miss the moment with PayPal, I‚Äôll tell you everything later <br>  I am trying to connect the card and I get an error - ‚ÄúThe debit card is closed by the bank with the e-mail ...‚Äù <br>  * heck!!! <br><br>  I go to PrivatBank <br>  I begin to communicate with a bank employee (I, S - employee): <br>  I - you told me that I can pay with this card in the Internrt <br>  C - Yes <br>  I - but the PayPal system does not understand to connect the card <br>  S - and you wrote the application? <br>  I - what else statement, you said nothing about him <br>  S - well, in order to work with your personal card in Internrt, you need to write an application, to do this, go to the common room and write an application with any employee <br>  * heck!  I have already started to tear the roof off this runner%) <br><br>  I begin to communicate with a bank employee (I, S - employee 2): <br>  I - I need to open access to the Internet for my personal card <br>  C - you can do it here or via chat on PrivatBank website <br>  I - let me do everything with you <br>  C - well, I open it to you for one month. <br>  I - let's go for a year so that I don‚Äôt fool around with the request every month <br>  C - first you need to register 3 months by month <br>  I * hell <br><br>  * Access is available for a limited amount of money, and more precisely for the amount that you have on the card, if you need to increase it, then you need to write in the chat of PrivatBank%) <br>  I wrote a statement and the day the card earned <br><br><h4>  Paypal </h4><br>  Registered in <a href="http://paypal.com/">PayPal</a> (enter the correct data, because many shops check the data from the store account and paypal'a!).  Then I went to <b>Profile -&gt; Edit add a credit card</b> and entered my data: <br><img src="http://img198.imageshack.us/img198/6365/paypal1j.png" alt="image"><br>  and added a card, after which the system withdrew $ 1.95 from the card and asked to view information about the transaction in the bank, the 4-digit code must be present in the payment information. <br>  The next day I went to the bank and asked for a report on the transactions for the last day, as it turned out they did not immediately get to the bank‚Äôs reports for the office staff, but 2 times a week, and my transaction was not :(. And the employee said that she needed to come to At the beginning of the next week, she can ask in the chat and it will take 15 minutes, and after a short period I had a code on my hands (communicate with them as politely as possible, otherwise you will be delayed for a long time). <br>  In PayPal, I entered the code <br><img src="http://img230.imageshack.us/img230/3506/paypal2y.png" alt="image"><br>  and the card has earned. <br><br>  And the first thing I checked the card performance in iTunes on my USA account, but I could not do it because the addresses did not match, I had to go to the nearest Russia region, I‚Äôm from Ukraine <br>  Entered data: <br><img src="http://img38.imageshack.us/img38/7303/cardk.png" alt="image"><br>  The system missed my data and I bought 2 applications <br><img src="http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/7669/appwh.png" alt="image"><br>  and bought a theme for the site through PayPal <br><br>  That's how it was;) <br>  If you have other ways, share ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83839/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83839/</a></p>
