Strongly knit, with short-cropped hair and a beard, Lipman stood in a greenhouse located in the middle of Long Island, surrounded by abundant and lush vegetation.  ‚ÄúOh, don't even ask,‚Äù he responded about the late and harsh spring.  It was Tuesday mid-April, but the forecast was told about the probability of snow falling, and a cold wind blew across the island.  This is not at all the weather that brings to mind the thought of summer tomatoes.  But Lipman was thinking about the future, about the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%258C_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_(%25D0%25A1%25D0%25A8%25D0%2590)">Day of Remembrance</a> [last Monday of May / approx.  transl.], when thousands of carefully planted tomato seedlings are transferred from greenhouses to the fertile land of Long Island.  He hoped that the weather would finally change. <br><br>  Although he worked as a teenager on a farm and had a romantic affection for the land, Lipman was not a farmer.  He's a botanist at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York who studies genetics and plant development.  And all these greenhouse plants are not ordinary tomatoes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Introducing me to his constant companion Charlie (a sociable and slobbering labrador with a rottweiler), Lipman took me past hundreds of plants that indulge in daytime temperatures of 27 ¬∫C, humidity from 40 to 60%, stimulating them for 14-hour photosynthesis using <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D1%2580%25D1%258F%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0">sodium discharge lamps high pressure</a> .

      This greenhouse is different in that 90% of its plants were genetically modified with the help of a magical technology for editing genes, known as <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR">Crispr / Cas-9</a> - which makes it probably the epicenter of a botanical revolution that can forever change the future of not only tomatoes, but and many other food crops.  Lipman and Joyce van Eck, his long-time partner from the Beuys Thompson Institute in Ithaca, New York, belong to a small army of researchers who use gene editing to turn a tomato into a botanical laboratory mouse.  In this greenhouse, Crispr is a verb, every plant is an experiment, and a mutant is not a bad word. <br><br>  Lipman walked to the far side of the building and pointed to various tomatoes of a special large variety - one of the commercial options that are sold in supermarkets, and not in farmers' markets.  This plant, which was about two months old, was bent under the weight of large, almost mature fruits.  It was a mutant, as Lipman explained, which they call "knotless."  Most tomatoes on the stem near the place of the formation of the fruit have a swollen accumulation of tissue, a knot.  When the tomato ripens, he says to himself, as Lipman put it, ‚ÄúOK, I have ripened - it's time to fall,‚Äù the node's cells receive a signal to die, and let the tomato go.  So nature spreads tomato seeds;  but this node has always been an unpleasant problem of agriculture, since it left a part of the stem making holes in mechanically collected fruits.  Knotless tomatoes, which can tear off the stem at the root, were obtained and grown for commercial use, but often they had side effects.  These genetically modified versions avoid the unintended effects of traditional breeding.  ‚ÄúNow we can use Crispr to work directly with the gene, cut it off with molecular scissors, which leads to a mutation,‚Äù said Lipman.  ‚ÄúAnd voila: a knotless property of any sort you need.‚Äù <br><br>  We moved on to several examples of Physalis pruinosa, a relative of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581_%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2589%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9">vegetable Physalis</a> , producing small and juicy fruits of Physalis.  This plant has not yet been domesticated, and Lipman describes his wild version as a ‚Äúmonster‚Äù: tall, untidy and greedy, giving one pitiful fruit to the outgrowth.  Physalis was growing next to it, in which scientists called a mutation called ‚Äúself-trimming‚Äù.  It was two times lower, not so bushy, and there were five or six fruits on each process.  Lipman plucked one fruit from a mutant and offered it to me. <br><br>  ‚ÄúSniff it first,‚Äù he asked.  ‚ÄúEnjoy the smell.‚Äù  The smell was exotic and a bit tropical.  I put it in my mouth and bit it, getting an explosion of different tastes.  Like the related tomatoes, the taste turned out to be mysterious, smeared in time sweet and sour, decorated with volatile components that found my nose and complemented the taste. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYou just ate an edited plant,‚Äù said Lipman, smiling.  ‚ÄúBut don't worry too much.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/034/050/98a/03405098a7086bb75d15a001f8944d79.jpg"><br>  <i>Zach Lipman among edited tomatoes</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f29/b28/15d/f29b2815d3e644a7b816b0f789436826.jpg"><br>  <i>Genetically edited tomato bush</i> <br><br>  Lipman, like most scientists, believes that genetically modified plants are safe to eat.  But his mischievous smile serves as an admission that not everyone considers this technology harmless.  With genetic editing of plants associated with many troubles.  GMO crops, such as corn or soybeans, have been penetrating food, animal feed and biofuels for many years, and the battle around them has divided society in the United States and other countries.  The Crispr revolution reinvents, or even re-ignites this debate.  Most of the existing plants today were edited through the removal of genes (through mutation), and not through the introduction of genetic sequences taken from other species, as in the first generation of genetic modifications, which gave rise to fear of "frankenshtedoy" and environmental pollution.  Precisely because editing is now taking place through deletion rather than adding, scientists argue that the current form of gene editing imitates mutations that occurred during classical agricultural selection.  Perhaps this difference will not reassure critics, but it has convinced government regulators;  genetically modified soybeans and potatoes are already being grown, and last March the USDA announced that the crops obtained using genetic editing are ‚Äúindistinguishable‚Äù from those obtained by traditional selection and do not ‚Äúrequire state supervision.‚Äù <br><br>  The future of food attacks many questions: how to feed 9 billion mouths, how to farm in an era of unprecedented climatic uncertainty, how to create more stable and nutritious food for the public concerned about the new technology.  Botanists are already using Crispr and related technologies for a fundamental change of plants - they edit wheat, reducing its gluten content, soybeans to get more useful oil, corn to increase yields, potatoes to improve storage (and reduce carcinogenic waste during cooking).  In industrial and scientific laboratories, new editing tools are being developed that can seriously affect the food we all eat.  However, this new-found ability to transform food coincided with the consolidation of agriculture into three megaconglomerates.  These companies have the means to launch a new technology.  The question is why they will use it. <br><br>  Soy, potatoes and corn are seamlessly embedded in the food chain, but tomatoes add a big red exclamation mark to the current debate.  Probably no other food crop can be more symbolic, considering what is at stake in terms of agriculture, biology, culture and growing homemade food.  Tomato - the king of farmers' markets, the pearl of a home garden, alpha-vegetable of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE">locks</a> .  The Lipman greenhouse presents only a few variants of how gene editing already changes tomatoes - it has plants that are blooming earlier, do not pay attention to the presence or absence of light, occupy a smaller area, place several fruits on the stem at once. <br><br>  For people who love to eat or grow tomatoes (I am from both categories), the emergence of Crispr causes cynicism and dizzying hopes for the future of our favorite vegetable.  Cynicism arises because most practical scientific attempts will perpetuate the bland taste of commercially grown tomatoes.  In a sense, this is simply a sign of the victory of food producers seeking a greater yield for less money, above the tastes of consumers who are served with taste and nutrition.  (Harry Klee, a tomato expert at the University of Florida, says that the size of the ideal tomato for the industry should exactly match the size of the McDonald's hamburger).  And hope is because there is something intriguing in the use of new technology for the preservation of the delicious, sweet-sour explosion of the <a href="http://pomidom.ru/%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2584%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2589/">family</a> tomato <a href="http://pomidom.ru/%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2584%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2589/">variety</a> in a more resistant, not susceptible to disease plant. <br><br>  After walking with Lipman through his garden of human-made mutations, I could not help asking if Crispr will get any of the family varieties that I try to grow myself every year. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe do not edit family varieties,‚Äù said Lipman.  - Until.  But it is already in development.  They can benefit from minor adjustments. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e5c/95c/6e4/e5c95c6e4d5cf9ce15d8be3b42532f84.jpg"><br>  <i>Tomatoes indulge and force photosynthesis at the Boyes Thompson Institute</i> <br><br>  This is a story about tomatoes.  But still, like all agricultural stories, a story about mutations, both ‚Äúnatural‚Äù and man-made, tricky, invisible mutations and overly grotesque, mutations created in the laboratory earlier this year, and those that could have happened 10,000 years back, like the ones that turned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanum_pimpinellifolium">Solanum pimpinellifolium</a> (currant tomato), an untidy perennial weed that produces fruits the size of peas, and growing on the Pacific coast in Peru and Ecuador, into these beautiful and huge fruits of family varieties growing in your garden.  Our cultural dictionary left the word ‚Äúmutation‚Äù only a mocking meaning, but if you think this word is bad, you probably shouldn't read further - and not eat vegetable food.  The basic principle of plant breeding is to take advantage of genetic changes, mutations, without regard to whether these mutations are caused by sunlight, X-rays or Crispr.  As Kle says, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know a single food crop, which can be found in a supermarket, not changed drastically compared to its wild-growing version.‚Äù <br><br>  Any gardener is, voluntarily or involuntarily, a specialist in mutations.  All the different varieties of family tomatoes - thin-skinned ‚Äúbrandivine‚Äù, apricot-bright ‚ÄúJoan Flamm‚Äù, greenish ‚Äúblack Crimea‚Äù, and my favorite ‚ÄúBern rose‚Äù, rosy and delicious in taste - are products of long-standing low-quality mutations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bda/e1a/d82/bdae1ad82f6f34341bf65ae768da2044.jpg"><br>  <i>Research plantings at Cold Spring Harbor, where about 8,000 genetically edited plants grow</i> <br><br>  Every spring I sit on the floor with a bunch of pots filled with peat and initial soil, and awkwardly press the seeds of the above varieties into the virgin land.  My wife wonders why I shouldn‚Äôt buy ready-made seedlings on the market right away, like everyone else, but I never outgrew my childish delight of watching how a tiny piece of plant DNA, surrounded by a hard shell of a seed, turns into a 1.5-meter plant that produces its flawless presents.  The gardeners, the first self-taught biologists, are known for this delight.  Like Lipman.  That is how he engaged in genetic editing of tomatoes. <br><br>  Lipman grew up in Milford, Connecticut.  His father taught his native language, and his mother worked in health care.  Among his earliest memories is a visit to a nearby farm with his father, at the age of 6-7, when he collected pumpkins lying here and there on the field, with their amazing shapes and colors. <br><br>  This pumpkin field belonged to Robert Trit's farm, and when Lipman turned 13, he began working there every summer, cultivating his love for plants.  When he graduated from school in 1996, he decided to start breeding and plant genetics, first at Cornell University, and then at Cold Spring Harbor, where he defended his doctorate, and now works as a researcher at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. <br><br>  Lipman's office is the temple of the tomato.  Old labels with canned tomatoes and postcards with unreal huge tomatoes adorn the walls, and on the table, in old boxes, in wooden trays and plastic cabinets near the wall, thousands of small brown envelopes are stored with seeds, marked by years and varieties.  The most characteristic relic is right at the door - a large reproduction in a frame from the book of the XVI century by <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8,_%25D0%259F%25D1%258C%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE_%25D0%2590%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B0">Pietro Andrea Mattioli</a> , which is considered the oldest color image of a tomato, made immediately after the Spanish expansion to America.  For genetics like Lipman, Mattioli's drawing is especially important because it indicates that the pre-Columbian inhabitants of America could recognize the useful mutation of tomatoes - they had already turned a small wild fruit into large and golden. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5dd/ea5/7be/5ddea57be32e54732eec9a0f44fc978f.jpg"><br>  <i>Seeds are stored in boxes and then planted.</i> <br><br>  Until the 1930s, agricultural specialists relied on the same technology as the first farmers who grew tomatoes in North America: wait patiently until nature produces a useful mutation, to be able to recognize a useful property (for example, larger fruits), and create a new variety with this property by selecting mutated strains and propagating them.  In other words, agriculture has always stood for unnatural selection ‚Äî the choice of mutations by a person and the abandonment of others.  During the Second World War, biologists have accelerated this process, deliberately causing mutations in the seeds with chemicals, x-rays and other radiation.  But in this case, the process was slow.  Selection of the desired properties can easily stretch for ten years. <br><br>  Everything began to change in 2012, the fateful year for tomatoes.  In May of that year, plant genetics specialists completed the tomato genome project - they deciphered the entire DNA sequence, all 900 million paired bases on 12 chromosomes.  Then, in June, a group led by Jennifer Dudna of the University of California at Berkeley published the first work on a new gene editing technology, Crispr, which was soon followed by groups from the Broad Institute at MIT and Harvard.  These two streams of research competed with each other to see if the new technology works with plants. <br><br>  As soon as the information about Crispr appeared, Lipman thought: ‚ÄúIs it possible to apply it to tomatoes?  If it is possible, then forward. ‚Äù  It was necessary to quickly conduct an experiment with the genes of the tomato, which could prove the effectiveness of Crispr without delay.  What gene did Lipman and van Eck intend on?  Not one that would improve the size or shape of the fetus, since it would take a lot of time, and van Eck was impatient.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want it to be planted in a greenhouse and wait for it to grow,‚Äù she told Lipman.  ‚ÄúI want us to see something already in the Petri dish.‚Äù  So they chose a gene that is completely useless economically, and even less useful from a consumer point of view.  It was a strange gene that, as a result of a mutation, produced disfigured tomato leaves that looked like needles.  The mutated version was called ‚Äúwire‚Äù. <br><br>  The wire mutation was so poorly known that van Eck had to dig up a work from 1928 describing it in order to understand what she needed to look for.  For each mutation using the Crispr technology, a specially prepared tool called the ‚Äúconstruct‚Äù is <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25A0%25D0%259D%25D0%259A">required</a> ‚Äî a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25A0%25D0%259D%25D0%259A">guide RNA</a> that allows you to target a specific tomato gene and the accompanying enzyme that cuts off the plant's DNA in the right place.  In this case, Lipman developed a construct aimed at the wire gene and cutting it out.  Mutation, strictly speaking, is caused not by Crispr technology, but by the plant itself, trying to heal the wound.  Van Eck used a bacterium that perfectly infects plants to introduce the Crispr mutation into tomato cells.  After mutation, these cells were transferred to Petri dishes, where they began to develop, giving rise to plants.  Van Eck still had to wait a couple of months before the tomato cells turned into sprouts and grew shoots with leaves, but it was worth the wait. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI still remember when I saw the first leaves,‚Äù she recalls.  They were twisted into needles.  ‚ÄúAdored, it worked!‚Äù She screamed, and rushed through the corridors of the institute, telling everyone who was ready to listen.  "I was on edge, because, well, what generally works the first time?" <br><br>  They not only demonstrated that Crispr can cause an inherited trait change in food crops, but also got their results in a couple of months instead of a year.  They knew that the same process could, in principle, be used for editing, with extreme precision and unprecedented speed, any gene in any culture. <br><br>  As soon as they were convinced that everything was working, Lipman and van Eck began to "crack" all the properties that they had just wanted to study in the last 15 years.  One of them was the knotless property.  For 60 years, researchers have been trying to solve the problem of having a knot on a tomato shoot.    ‚Äì       10    ‚Äì   ,   ,  ,        . ,   , ,              .  ,        :      ,        -   .         ‚Äì    ‚Äì              . <br><br>      Crispr     ,      ,    ,      .       ,      ,    2016        .

Scientists will tell you that Crispr perfectly knows how to turn off genes. But it is not so easy to use it to insert new genes, as many advise, to ‚Äúoverwrite‚Äù the genetic line of a person, animal or plant. "Crispr is not a universal solution for everything," says Dan Voitas of the University of Minnesota, one of the pioneers of agricultural gene editing. Moreover, the genomes are very complex, even in plants. Just as a dozen knobs on a stereo tape recorder can form the sound of a single song, many genetic elements control the effects of a single gene.</font></font><br><br>            . ¬´ ,      , ‚Äî  ,   .    : ‚Äû <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580"></a> CRISPR‚Äú. <br><br>  ,     ( )      ,  ,    .     ,       ‚Äì -   ‚Äì   .  ,    ,     Crispr     ,    ,   ,      ? <br><br>   -   ,  .  -        Cell    :             ,  ,   .

But, sooner or later, you will have to talk about its reverse side. Would consumers eat these tomatoes? Will Crispr-vegetables and grains become simply ‚Äúnew GMOs‚Äù, as some fighters for the environment think, or are genetically edited plants different from the usual ones? ‚ÄúThis is the beginning of a new conversation,‚Äù says Lipman. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The old conversation was caustic and emotional. The original genetically modified products from </font></font><a href="http://monsanto/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Monsanto</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">were "transgenic", that is, biologists inserted other people's DNA from plants from other species. Gene editing is much more like old forms of mutagenesis, such as radiation and chemicals, but it‚Äôs not so unsystematic. Instead of receiving random mutations, Crispr targets specific genes. (When editing it is possible to miss, although Lipman has not yet met with such cases). That is why botanists are so eager to use this technology, and therefore the USDA considers edited cultures similar to the early mutagens, and does not require their special regulation. (In the case of adding new genes to the plants, the ministry decided to consider each case separately). Some European countries have banned GMOs,and the European Union has yet to make a final decision on genetically edited plants.</font></font><br><br>             ,    .  2016  ,  39%  ,        ,  ,                . <br><br>    ,       .

When I asked Harry Klee if he tried any 8059 Knotless tomatoes he grows, he laughed and said he was not honored. ‚ÄúWe know that the Florida 8059 variety doesn‚Äôt have any taste as such.‚Äù Improving the taste of tomatoes has always played only a second fiddle in a market economy. Most of the tomatoes growing in Florida go to the food industry ‚Äî ‚Äúto McDonald's and subways,‚Äù as Kle says. "The sad reality is that the industry does not seek to bring out a more tasty tomato." Kli loves to talk about taste - he heads the group that has identified a couple of dozen genetic sites responsible for the exceptional taste of tomatoes. ‚ÄúWe absolutely know how to produce a sweeter, more tasty tomato,‚Äù he says. But such tomatoes are economically unattractive."Farmers will not accept them."</font></font><br><br>     ?      ,     ? ,  ,       ? <br><br>        -  ,  -     .  ,    ,  ¬´    ¬ª.     ,         ,       ‚Äì      ,   ,   .   ,  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%2582,_%25D0%25A3%25D1%2581%25D1%258D%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BD"> </a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">on a hundred meters, and then turn into emaciated, withered plants, suffering from all sorts of ailments, fungi and parasites, with falling brown leaves. It would be tempting to use new technology to edit them. Kli "is looking forward to when editing the genes will come to the gardens". He believes that gardeners like me can take the argument that genetically edited tomatoes are not GMOs.</font></font><br><br> ¬´,       ‚Äû‚Äú    ,   ,    ? ‚Äì   . ‚Äì       ,     .       ,   ‚Äû‚Äú,   ,   ,      ,   ,    - .    ?¬ª <br><br> ¬´!¬ª ‚Äì   . <br><br> ¬´ ,    , ‚Äî  . ‚Äì ,         ,     ¬ª. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not everyone will agree with Kli (or me). Voitas, a pioneer of plant editing genes, laughed when I asked him about the genetic editing of family varieties. ‚ÄúPartly because these are family varieties. That is, the name suggests that it is some kind of value from the past. And not something new, technological. " A little closer to the point, he reminded me of the "outrageous" prices for licensing the technology of gene editing. "Therefore, your idea of ‚Äã‚Äãedited family tomatoes will never become financially attractive for someone to pay for a license." </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The result: genetically edited tomatoes, apparently, already on the way to the market. But tomatoes with improved taste should not be expected in the near future.</font></font><br><br>         . ,   , ,       8000         --.      ‚Äì , ,   . ¬´ !¬ª ‚Äì  ,   ,         . <br><br>        ,  ,       .     . ¬´      , ¬ª, ‚Äî  . ,          . ¬´  , ‚Äî  . ‚Äì       .      ?         ,        ‚Äì     !¬ª </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/418885/">https://habr.com/ru/post/418885/</a></p>
