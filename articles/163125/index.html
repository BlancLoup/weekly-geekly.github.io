I noticed that some assaults are very effective, and some even more difficult to solve the problem.  I wondered how this problem was solved in the world, and then I came across an article by Richard Branson, the founder of <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin">Virgin</a> , which talks about the principles of successful brainstorming. <br><br>  Useful tips from the British billionaire under the cut. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/alconost/blog/163125/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/372/d27/d83/372d27d830783dec754949a79c146b0e.jpg"></a>

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  When I participated in attempts to set a speed record for transoceanic balloon flights in the 80s and 90s, we found ourselves in unpleasant situations.  And for me, the term ‚Äúbrainstorming‚Äù is forever associated with the memory of how we are carried in a hot air balloon 9 kilometers above the earth at the very center of a thunderstorm.  In these panicky-invigorating minutes, the whole team was brainwashed over how to survive.  Fortunately, we always managed to come up with something and get out of a difficult situation. <br><br>  And although not every brainstorming session is associated with the choice between life and death, the principle is one.  If you are faced with a problem with an unobvious solution, brainstorming is a great way to use the collective knowledge of your employees and find this solution.  Here are eight tips on how to get the most out of your brainstorming. <br><br><h2>  1. To think outside the box, avoid standard moves. </h2><br>  Many management consultants offer regular brainstorming sessions so that you and your team can ‚Äúthink outside the box‚Äù or provide ‚Äúfree flight of thought.‚Äù  I hate these expressions - because creative efforts cannot be planned.  You and your employees need to strive for innovative approaches in every aspect of your work every day.  And brainstorming is really good when you are stalled and can not find a solution. <br><br><h2>  2. Choose an environment that stimulates creativity. </h2><br>  I noticed that I generate my best ideas when I am on the move - traveling, doing or just walking.  If a problem arises in front of you and you decide to brainstorm, pull everyone out of the close, stuffy office, which in no way contributes to creative thinking. <br>  It is important to enjoy changing the landscape for at least half an hour before starting work, and do not forget to take breaks.  Shifting classes ‚Äî playing, practicing, or listening to music ‚Äî can help participants relax and return to working with new forces. <br><br><h2>  3. Describe the problem, not the solution. </h2><br>  When participants in brainstorming are going to create, they must have a practical goal, otherwise you will not achieve anything.  When the conversation comes to a standstill, remind everyone of the problem you are trying to solve, and continue to work in a given direction. <br><br><h2>  4. Maintain fresh ideas </h2><br>  Than to surround yourself with the same people on every brainstorming, it‚Äôs better to invite employees from other departments of the company to participate - it may turn out that they have great ideas.  Suddenly one of your accountants will suggest an idea that will translate into a non-standard marketing strategy, or will one of the administrators tell you about changes that will help you come up with a new approach to sales? <br><br><h2>  5. Make sure all opinions are heard. </h2><br>  Bright people sitting in a corner can have bright ideas, but unless you provide everyone with a chance to speak, they won‚Äôt be heard because of someone screaming.  Encourage listening to opinions no less than saying them. <br><br><h2>  6. Record everything </h2><br>  Any ideas arising during a brainstorming should be recorded.  All these ingenious finds will not bring you any benefit if you forget them.  I carry a laptop with me in order to be able to write down every useful idea I have encountered, regardless of context, and then review them. <br><br><h2>  7. Bring the best ideas to life. </h2><br>  Do not think on the table - say "yes" to potentially successful ideas resulting from brainstorming.  Of course, sometimes you will make mistakes, but if you take risks, it will increase your chances of succeeding.  And before you go after a brainstorming session, always discuss what each of you will do to implement good ideas. <br>  . <br><h2>  8. Listen and understand, and then make a decision. </h2><br>  In the book ‚ÄúThe Spy, Get Out!‚Äù By John Le Carre (Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy), the protagonist George Smiley succinctly described the endless postponement of collective decisions due to disagreements and disputes: Is an animal with four hind legs. ‚Äù  This often happens in a business where timely judgments are extremely important. <br><br>  And although I am here talking about the importance of brainstorming, the ability to listen and learn from others, I myself often succumb to the impulse.  Looking back, I see that some of my decisions about launching ideas into the work, which later turned out to be ingenious, were adopted impromptu.  (For some reason, they call me Doctor Yes.) In business, as in life, sometimes you have to trust your own ability to lead a company to achieve goals that seem unattainable to others. <br><br>  But there is a risk: sometimes I approved and not the most successful ideas in the same way - following the impulse.  But in general, you should carefully listen to your own intuition before acting. <br><br>  In the end, you need to find a balance between different approaches: brainstorm in search of the optimal idea or go it alone.  Use brainstorming to get the vision of your employees, get acquainted with their best ideas, but in the end you still have to make a choice and take responsibility for the decision. <br><br><br>  <b>About the translator</b> <br><br>  The article is translated in Alconost. <br><br>  Alconost is engaged in the <a href="https://alconost.com/services/software-localization%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dtranslation%26utm_content%3D8-ways-improve-brainstorm">localization of applications, games and websites</a> in 60 languages.
