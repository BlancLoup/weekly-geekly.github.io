I think the train of thought will be something like this: ‚Äú <i>Oh, and a normal phone!</i>  <i>Interesting, works?</i>  <i>I'll check now.</i>  <i>Who is there to track the satellite?</i>  <i>All this stories from the movies, and I also found it, if that.</i>  <i>Hooray, it works.</i>  <i>So ... what's so interesting about it?</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/18a/94f/14d/18a94f14dae522b31ce255004f62e140.jpg"><br>  <i>Xx, intimate sms) Well Katka gives !!!</i>  <i>So ... and this seems to be her photos) Commendable, commendable.</i>  <i>So, music, Vidic ... oh!</i>  <i>Mail is logged in!</i>  <i>The tin, to it also the keeper is attached!</i>  <i>So, okay ... I will remove everything from sin away, insert my SIM card and live with a new phone - do not carry it to the police</i> . ‚Äù <br><br>  Agree, it would be unpleasant to be "on the other side" of this situation?  After all, the loss of a phone as a piece of iron is often only half the trouble.  Under the cat we are talking about one program that can help in such situations. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Well, or here's another script.  You came to work and realized that there was no phone.  They called my wife and she reassured you that you left him at home.  You come home, get a delicious slap in the face and decide what to do with your things, carelessly left in black opaque packages) But it would seem - remove all compromising material and the problem will exhaust itself. <br><br>  Today I will talk about one program from Kaspersky, which will help if not to return the phone, then at least to avoid the scripts mentioned and similar to them.  Wait <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D_hOmQy4H6CM">throw</a> boots and cows - finish reading, and only then ...)

      If you can call it that, acquaintance with this product began at the RIW2010 event - there was a Kaspersky stand, where branded condoms were distributed from useful ones :) A girl came up to me from the company's stand and presented an advertising booklet about Mobile Kaspersky - without opening, I threw it out with the thought ‚Äúthanks, of course, but I definitely don‚Äôt need an antivirus on the phone.‚Äù  He immediately forgot about all this and walked with a clear conscience further along the exhibition - the girls from Megaplan were much more interesting)) <br><br>  But more recently, the ‚Äúrandom meeting‚Äù was repeated - I have a separate group of people in ICQ, who constantly send links to all sorts of commercials, pictures, news, and other ‚Äúfresh ones‚Äù;  one of these links was a very original viral video, after viewing which, I went to the site written at the end - as you might have guessed, there was a redirect to the site ... yes, yes, this one) After such perseverance I read what they offer, although the antivirus market has never been interested. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/UsmEYB03juc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhlucytp3skBGJPkR053NgvWxp_SA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  If it was just an antivirus for the phone, then you would definitely not read this text now, although there is also an antivirus there) But after recent adventures, I decided that such a program in my arsenal would not be superfluous.  And that's why. <br><br>  <b>Kaspersky Mobile Security 9</b> is a cross-platform application that represents a whole range of solutions: antivirus, firewall, antispam, anti-virus, ‚Äúpersonal contacts‚Äù and something else.  At first it may seem that all this is the imposition of firewalls and other functions unnecessary for the phone, but as it turned out, everything is called by the wrong names - all functions are the most telephone functions.  I don't see any point in painting everything in detail - unlike hardware, you can always download the program and try it yourself ... well, or you can download the user's manual (in PDF), where everything is written in much more detail. <br><br>  So, let me begin by saying that the program in a state of neglect eats only 800-900kb of memory, which in my case is almost three times less than the running SMS application, for example.  It surprised me - regarding antiviruses, I have a stereotypical thinking that they all eat the lion's share of resources and interfere in every way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c35/2e6/f27/c352e6f27a51af05a18ed633f2d49190.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/562/e9d/6eb/562e9d6ebf577a9ec05cb925e6c3c4db.png"><br><br>  When you first start the program offers to enter the "secret code" - this is not just a code to close access to the program settings from prying eyes - this combination will keep the most useful functionality of the program. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/579/05f/0fc/57905f0fc745e795322acde1d0396f05.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/65e/06b/a08/65e06ba0830dd838be65b59ef2e2c48a.png"><br><br>  The main screen consists of 5 indicators that display the status of a module.  Using the menu button, you can enter any of these modules and, if necessary, adjust the parameters.  I'll start with the most useful. <br><br><h2>  Anti-theft </h2><br>  In the setting of this module there are 6 items presented in the screenshot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/502/de8/938/502de8938b97a0c556dd89ab7d8001b4.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/297/94d/1bb/29794d1bbabeb31a7227ff222693d6e2.png">  <b>Lock</b>  Allows you to remotely lock the device, turning it into a "brick".  As a bonus, it is possible to enter text that the attacker sees when the device is turned on.  Initially, it is proposed to voluntarily return the device to the owner, but nothing prevents you from entering a more bloodthirsty and malicious text.  You can unlock the phone by entering a pre-set code. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9b1/76c/e25/9b176ce25957f4aeb11f8207b582e882.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f3c/8a4/85c/f3c8a485ccf3d1cf9b96ba10de1afe1a.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/297/94d/1bb/29794d1bbabeb31a7227ff222693d6e2.png">  <b>Deletion of data</b> .  Everything speaks for itself, but see what kind of picture.  If you remotely lock the phone, then the attacker immediately feels something is wrong - most likely immediately try to immediately get rid of the phone.  But it is possible that someone does not want to get rid of, for example, from the same HD2.  You can not burn and increase the chances of finding the device, but at the same time, make sure that you are not ashamed of yourself - remotely delete all the necessary personal data, such as contacts, messages, or any folders.  Everything is more or less flexibly configured, so you can register folders to keeper, asek and other operas. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/297/94d/1bb/29794d1bbabeb31a7227ff222693d6e2.png">  <b>SIM control</b> .  Enter your second number (the one that will be near in case of trouble) and / or email - the number of the SIM card that will be inserted into your phone comes.  All this will be done the same way without the knowledge of the new owner, although after sending the phone, you can also ‚Äúshake‚Äù with the withdrawal of a separate message.  But, again, you can not hope for the integrity of the new owner and not burn, and continue the quest. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f4d/daf/89f/f4ddaf89fa0cf8394342f8bb3aed793a.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fb2/2bf/07f/fb22bf07fd310b877a60dbc5d6660f9e.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/297/94d/1bb/29794d1bbabeb31a7227ff222693d6e2.png">  <b>GPS search</b> .  Allows you to determine the geographical coordinates (in Google Maps) device and send them by mail / sms.  Understandably, it works only on devices with GPS, but there are plenty of them now;  the service itself includes a GPS module, and if the satellites are not caught, it will make several attempts - all this is also "quietly". <br><br>  If desired, you can optionally block the phone with a separate message on the screen. <br><br>  As you can see, it is just difficult to think of something else - almost all the initial conditions for completing the quest will be.  The action plan is as follows: as soon as the phone is stolen, we take any phone and a helmet to your sms number like ‚Äúwipe: password‚Äù (the same password that was set at the very beginning) - all unnecessary data for prying eyes will be deleted (do not forget to make backups at home), and your new phone will receive an SMS notification of this.  Then you can request the geographical location of the device (find: password), although the geographical coordinates, for example, of a whole institute are unlikely to give something (it makes sense to send such an SMS in the evening to find out where your phone went geographically - to someone students home or same in the direction of "rump").  If you wish, you can block the phone (block: password) <s>so that the phone remains to be sold and the sale of the property obtained by illegal means</s> is <s>added to the theft</s> - this will not save you from hard reset, but hardly anyone will immediately know the right combination of buttons for XP.  Yes, and pour the application into the memory of the firmware, in theory, it is possible that even after XP the phone was ‚Äútuned to the desired wave‚Äù. <br><br>  If the SIM card has been replaced, then the SIM card of the new owner will come to the second phone, and with this information you can already go to the uncles in the form - the number will reduce the search time, although you can break through the data yourself.  By the way, in case of replacing a SIM card, all the commands (search, delete, etc.) should be sent to the number of the new owner - he will not know about them, but the program will process them properly. <br><br>  Actually, everything is only because of this function, I left the application on my phone) Although there are a lot of other tasty features, which I will tell you quite briefly. <br><br>  <b>Antivirus</b> <br>  It can hang in memory and monitor all files (or only executables) and, if necessary, heal-delete them.  And it can be turned off (in order not to eat resources) and work only on demand.  There is a memory check (on HD2 it took 5 seconds), certain folders or the entire device (almost 30 minutes were spent on 41000+ files of my device) - as I expected, there are no viruses.  In general, I caught the virus on the phone only once - on the Nokia E60, when all the icons of my phone turned into shards) So I very much doubt the usefulness of the antivirus for the phone.  If all software is taken from "trusted sources" and not downloaded from the left torrents with cracks, then it is definitely not needed) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/114/d5c/503/114d5c503795be8cd8f5f92df51e8a32.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/931/fc0/1c9/931fc01c9b455b3f98027fa80d9c19a9.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d75/4c5/04a/d754c504ab7c6c3897843bb95bb21ec5.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a36/088/7f9/a360887f9560d2a1c2804d22a17a39b5.png"><br><br>  <b>Personal contacts</b> <br>  We set the necessary contacts and after pressing the "red button" (or by sms-command) all the specified contacts (as well as the associated SMS and calls) will be hidden.  It is hidden, not deleted.  I realized that this function works right away - the contact specified in the settings disappeared from the quick calls to the HTC Sense shell, and the dialing of this number in the dialer hinted that this number is not listed in the address book. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4ed/f9d/b67/4edf9db676a59d294ae002a7df5ba9d6.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b2a/827/4c7/b2a8274c760457368546c7856cd244dc.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c67/e6b/d52/c67e6bd52b4d8960a327f62c87686f49.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/229/769/ac0/229769ac0304aecfbe4033f4bd71eb93.png"><br><br>  <b>Encryption</b> <br>  This component allows you to encrypt pre-specified folders (except system) - for example, the entire flash drive in case someone got access to it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cb0/b55/3d8/cb0b553d8990eaee2532fffd74c1b503.png"><br><br>  <b>Anti spam</b> <br>  In this case, it is not about letters, but about SMS and calls.  There is a black and white list - in the first version it is possible to add someone to the blacklist, in the second version - all but ‚Äúour own‚Äù;  and you can turn on both lists at the same time.  There is a function of blocking non-numeric messages - it will be useful for those who participate in all sorts of promotions who like to sign participants for all sorts of ‚Äúnews‚Äù.  For example, they constantly write about Letual and Biblioglobus promotions, in which I had the imprudence to indicate the real number when registering a card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/66a/937/41b/66a93741b195f364b3301c019a9ca547.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/35e/51c/ccb/35e51cccb5406784b4272a1ead4509b6.png"><br><br>  <b>Parental control</b> <br>  This feature allows you to limit communication with unwanted numbers.  You can specify specific numbers or use masks.  For example, the ‚Äú????‚Äù mask will not allow a child to call and write to short numbers, and the ‚Äú8-800- *‚Äù mask will not allow to call any numbers starting with 8-800 ... Similarly, there are black and white lists. <br><br>  <b>Firewall</b> <br>  Limits the use of the phone to an Internet connection.  In most cases, this activity can be stopped by regular phone facilities (the simplest is ‚Äúon the plane‚Äù mode), but apparently, many people don‚Äôt even know about it - periodically there are reports on the Internet that someone in roaming has spoken for half a million . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/826/b9d/aa8/826b9daa85ab89c6b3ba21086e3aa91d.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c64/c38/c4e/c64c38c4e4ccd51f9f6c699b12c339f8.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2d8/82c/688/2d882c6882821014146e7205567caadc.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/662/5cb/aeb/6625cbaebf6a89d1331b65be97e7138e.png"><br><br>  Unfortunately, so far only two platforms are supported, Windows Mobile (5.0-6.5) and Symbian (9.1-9.4) - this short list still lacks at least two popular platforms on which the most expensive device segment is running) choose the phone model and download the version of the program (in the required language) specifically for it - on HTC HD2 everything worked for me without problems, on the Nokia N8 my wife has not tried it yet. <br>  Not so long ago, the function of sending sms refused on HD2 - in principle, I normally lived with this by sending sms over the Internet (from my number, via ICQ-gateway).  But just yesterday, the phone stopped catching the network - I decided that this was a software glitch, since nothing foreshadowed any troubles.  Before a hard-cut (or a flashing), I decided to try this program in order to have an idea about it and otherwise not to ‚Äúdirty‚Äù the system ... but now, perhaps, I will mean the program.  And everything turned out to be simple with the phone - I had long planned to change my SIM card to a new one (because I often changed it in the tested devices and it was worn out stupidly), but it turned out to be framed for a brother - only he could change it.  Some time ago I asked him to make me a duplicate, and yesterday he made it to me :) Finally, it all worked.  But I will still do hard-rezet, because I pretty much clogged the system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a1c/2bf/58b/a1c2bf58b1ce9e0d53952fc7135a9fe2.jpg"><br><br>  Just inserted a new SIM card, as it came to the mail: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c2a/ce8/f93/c2ace8f93d94afde024dd5f6549e6a90.png"><br><br>  Sorry for the next text inserted by the picture - from somewhere there appeared a 14kb restriction on the post and the output just did not fit. <br><br><h2>  The end </h2><br>  I wondered a couple of times like ‚Äúhow much gray hair will I get if a phone is stolen from me?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat interesting will the person who has found my lost ipad read?‚Äù Or ‚Äúhow long will it take to restore the information that was on the lost flash drive? ‚Äú- as a rule, you take care of this only when it is already happening.  Like it or not, I really don't want to lose my thing, especially if something necessary or useful is stored on it - that is why I am for regular backups.  But today we are talking about phones. <br>  Antivirus antivirus, but the most useful function of this program, in my opinion, is precisely the "anti-theft" - no one is immune from trouble, but this function can very well help with the preservation of nerves.  I know that there are also free analogues of this program, but there the scales are not at all those and the functionality, as a rule, is more modest.  It is strange that phone manufacturers do not do this function - is there nothing difficult in this?  But now the era of androids and iPhones, when so much is ‚Äútied‚Äù to one phone (starting from sms and asec, ending with email-facebook-dropboxes and other keeper), that the cost of the phone can fade due to information losses.  Do you think a statement to the police about the loss of the phone will give at least some results?  Bugagashenki.  But knowing the phone and the location of the new owner - this is half the battle.  The main thing - do not forget the password! <br>  In second place in terms of utility, hiding the ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù contacts in the phone and everything connected with them is exactly what is advertised in the video.  Relationships are built on trust, but we are all human)) I don‚Äôt betray my wife, but during my school years this function would help to avoid many unpleasant conversations and keep many sms filled with love and desires to be remembered) <br>  The "firewall" will be useful when traveling abroad, so that when roaming, the phone does not pump up anything unnecessary or order a bulldozer on ebee.  ‚ÄúAnti-spam‚Äù and ‚ÄúParental Control‚Äù are useful to those who are not indifferent to ‚Äúshort numbers‚Äù and constantly participate in some scam or wind up a rating on VKontakte;  Well, and to those to whom someone actively calls, but I do not belong to these risk groups. The remaining functions are useless for me. <br>  Everything would be fine, but the price of 720 rubles and the support of only two platforms (at the moment) immediately cuts off the lion's share of potential customers.  I am pleased to read about the experience of using certain programs, sharpened by a similar functionality. <br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/107921/">https://habr.com/ru/post/107921/</a></p>
