  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sports affiliate. Afileyu to help</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  First you need to decide which plan to choose when registering: revenue share (percentage of income / loss) or cpa (fixed amount for each).  It depends on what kind of traffic you drive.  If only bonushunters, then the CPU, since bonushunters are always in the black, if there are players, the percentage, since in the long-term period most will lose, and you will win accordingly.  It's a shame of course for the losers, but what to do, such statistics. <br><br>  Cpa have betfair, betdaq, ladbrokes, bet-at-home, totesport, betfred, vcbet, sportingindex, skybet, thegreek and a few more.  The amounts are different, from 15 pounds for registration to 300 dollars. <br><br>  Percentage have the rest, well, the above, too.  The percentage suggests that the player will lose, and you will receive a commission from this.  In most affiliate programs, if at the end of the month you have a minus, then the next month it will burn, and in some it will not burn (boylesports, pinnaclesports, 188bet, bet365).  This does not mean that in pinnaclesports, for example, you do not need to register at all.  Register wherever you can, just in these offices a little differently.  Maybe you will have someone to play all the time.

      Each affiliate must have an account in betfair affiliate program.  This is the only affiliate program that has no minus for sports at all, even if on a percentage.  They pay with a player win.  For this affiliate program and received the prize "Best Sports Affiliate Program" in cap awards 2009. <br><br>  There are affiliate programs with good conversion, sometimes with bad ones.  Depends on many factors, such as design, factors, registration convenience, promotions.  Those.  You can have many clicks in one office, but there are very few registrations, and in the other with the same clicks the opposite.  For me, sportingindex is a bad conversion, since there is a very difficult process of registering customers and a not-quite-usual method of betting (spread rates).  Although there is a high CPU (70 pounds per player).  Bad conversion is best avoided, or try something new in terms of promotion.  Those.  not standard banners, links, and maybe some contests or an explanation of how to play there, etc.  Bad conversion is still usually a big competition in the affiliate program.  For example, betfair is a very popular affiliate program, almost every site has it, so it‚Äôs becoming more and more difficult to have a good commission there.  This does not mean that it is better not to go there, for example, at one time I was in fifth place at Google‚Äôs request on betfair and this brought me a lot of high-quality customers who continue to play until now. <br><br>  You can promote in different ways: banners, text links, banners with coefficients, posts on forums, search engine optimization, etc.  Experiment.  If something does not go, try to change.  If there are a lot of clicks, and there are few registrations, look at the reason.  Maybe the office is just badly chosen, maybe people do not understand how to play there.  For example, you can offer a beginner bonus hunter to register through your links in exchange for a percentage of the commission, or if this is your friend, just for the sake of help or with any office. <br><br>  If you do not have your site, use another way of promotion (forums for example).  If you have a website, but there is little traffic or it is not very good, use the places where traffic is good.  In search engines, very high quality traffic, you just need to experiment. <br><br>  In affiliate programs will often be such that the user is registered on your link, but never began to play.  In statistics, all the zeros will be.  This is a normal situation, nothing can be done about it.  Maybe the user thought that he would simply register and automatically give him a bonus without a deposit, maybe he registered by mistake a second time, maybe he wanted to play, but an unexpected situation happened and he could not continue.  There are many reasons to look for what exactly it is not worth, if it is certainly not a failure of statistics.  Or it happens that it will play a little and no longer plays.  This is also a normal situation.  Nothing depends on you here.  Just keep on working and constantly attracting new customers. <br><br>  A few words about targeting.  Will it be a purely Russian-oriented site or can only English, decide for yourself.  For example, I practically do not attract Russian traffic, since I have a bad conversion.  This does not mean that Russians lose less or bring less commission, it‚Äôs just that I don‚Äôt work with them.  Although I know several affilites who do the same thing in the Russian segment and everything is fine there.  I focus more on England and Europe. <br><br>  Ask managers for exclusive bonuses for sports, offer your users something unusual that competitors do not have.  This will allow you to earn more commission and attract additional traffic. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/59258/">https://habr.com/ru/post/59258/</a></p>
