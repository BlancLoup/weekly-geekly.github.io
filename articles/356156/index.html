It was deleted after a while, since it is "outside the subject of the resource."  Then I asked the moderator to clarify in more detail and he replied: "This is a debatable question and there is no definite answer to it." </p><br><p>  During the time while the question existed, I received several answers: </p><br><p>  1 Appeal to the Constitutional Court. <br>  2 Apply for a visa and leave the jurisdiction of the RosKomNadzor authority. </p><br><p>  Asking the same question to the Internet, it turned out that I was not the only one who asked this question.  The user zakabum of the site RuTracker.org posted on the forum a <a href="https://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php%3Fp%3D73118367">sample application</a> ( <a href="https://rutracker.cr/forum/viewtopic.php%3Fp%3D73118367">mirror</a> ) that must be submitted to the provider.  And also lays out its new statements in the course of correspondence with its provider. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  Statement: </p><br><blockquote>  Good day. <br><br>  I cannot access some resources on the Internet due to Roskomnadzor‚Äôs locks.  Since we are from Switzerland and officially have no censorship (censorship is prohibited by the document with the highest legal force - the Constitution), I want to refuse Roskomnadzor services for filtering the Internet for services provided under an agreement with the company.  Please enter my address to the exceptions so that I am not affected by Roskomnadzor‚Äôs blocking. <br><br>  Since the requirements of Roskomnadzor cannot contradict the Constitution, therefore, these requirements apply only to public access to the Internet and should be immediately canceled individually if such a request comes from a citizen of the Russian Federation.  Since not fulfilling this requirement will violate the Constitution of the Russian Federation, and therefore - illegal.

      <br>
      Consequently, since the requirements of Roskomnadzor cannot violate the RF Constitution, and the content filtering is performed by the provider, it is not the fulfillment of the requirements of the citizen of the Russian Federation to disable content filtering services (censorship) is a violation of the laws of the Russian Federation by the provider company. <br>  If you think that Roskomnadzor has demanded that you violate Konstitutsii (the main law of the Russian Federation), then please contact him for clarification.  Otherwise, the legal responsibility of providing the imposed services rests entirely with the provider company. </blockquote><p>  I will quote the constitution about what rights are in question. </p><br><blockquote>  <a href="http://www.constitution.ru/10003000/10003000-4.htm">Section 29</a> <br><br>  1. Everyone is guaranteed freedom of thought and speech. <br><br>  2. Propaganda or agitation inciting social, racial, national or religious hatred and enmity are not allowed.

Everyone has the right to <u>freely seek, receive</u> , transmit, produce and distribute information in any legal way.  The list of information constituting a state secret is determined by federal law. <br><br>  5. Guaranteed freedom of the media.  <u>Censorship is prohibited</u> . </blockquote><p>  I found the answer to my question.  It remains to test it in practice. </p><br><p>  Update: </p><br><blockquote>  <a href="http://www.constitution.ru/10003000/10003000-4.htm">Article 23</a> <br><br>  1.
