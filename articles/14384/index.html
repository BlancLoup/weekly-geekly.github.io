      2. <a href="http://www.yandex.ru/">www.yandex.ru</a> launched to demonstrate the capabilities of Yandex technology, nobody thought about earnings from advertising. <br><br>  3. The slogan "There is everything" was invented in 2000.  In the same year, Yandex launched the first advertising of an Internet site on Russian television. <br><br>  4. All 10 people who worked at Yandex in 1997 work in it today. <br><br>  5. The first Yandex computers were called the letters of the old Russian alphabet - ‚Äúaz‚Äù, ‚Äúbeeches‚Äù, ‚Äúlead‚Äù, etc.  At working moments, it sounded like this: "the earth fell," "the place ended in goodness."  Then the Russian alphabet ended, during the week there was a discussion of which alphabet would be next.  They chose Armenian. <br><br>  6. The first two servers of Yandex stood under the feet of the first sysadmin.  The third server did not fit under my feet, I had to move to hosting at MTU.  In 2000, Yandex built the first own server, and since then all the servers are in its own data centers. <br><br>  7. When developing the first design of the main page of Yandex, it was not clear how to decorate it, except for the search line.  Come up with Tales and Numbers.  The Yandex logo was drawn at an angle, and we received letters: ‚ÄúCouldn't we just put a piece of paper in the scanner?‚Äù. <br><br>  8. Yandex became a separate company in 2000, and before that it was a division of CompTek. <br><br>  9. All algorithms and technologies of Yandex are developed inside - from searching the Internet to anti-spam in the mail and extracting facts in the news. <br><br>  10. September 23, 1997 about a dozen people knew about <a href="http://www.yandex.ru/">www.yandex.ru</a> .  Today, Yandex regularly uses more than 10 million. <br><br>  In fact, there are more than ten such facts and you can write to infinity.  We invite you to tell your stories related to Yandex. <br><br>  For example, one of our first users, Muscovite Andrei Zarudnev, recalls: ‚ÄúI went on a business trip (for a long time) to the USA in 2001.  He worked on a computer on which, of course, there were no Russian keys, so it was difficult to correspond with his pregnant wife, who remained in Moscow.  So, Yandex mail was madly helping me with its translit button and virtual keyboard;) ‚Äù. <br><br>  Another ‚Äúveteran,‚Äù Alexander Lazarev from Tambov, recalled the following story: ‚ÄúOn the day of birth, colleagues presented a kitten, completely black, without a single blond hair.  When he brought him home, the kitten immediately began to examine the darkest corners in the apartment - under the sofa, under the armchair, behind the closet ... And somewhere he hid.  For more than half an hour, I tried to find him, spat, sat at the computer, and, entering the mail, received congratulations on the holiday from Yandex.  With a picture: a completely black square, there is someone on it, holding a completely black cat by the tail, and of course the motto is ‚ÄúEverything will be found.  Yandex "". <br><br>  And Eduard Filin from Yekaterinburg sent the following story: ‚ÄúOnce, in the office of my wife Katerina, the cover of the copier broke.  Well, not that it broke - but somehow the whole was scratched, and it looked untidy))) And then Katerina caught the advertising page in the magazine: ‚Äúndex.  There is everything. ‚ÄùThe ad was bright and elegant, and the paper of the magazine is thick and glossy ... So since then this page has been copier-based.‚Äù <br><br>  via <a href="">ya.blog</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/14384/">https://habr.com/ru/post/14384/</a></p>
