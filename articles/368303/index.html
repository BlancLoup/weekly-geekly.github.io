And this does not interfere with advice from recognized experts.  We have previously published translations <a href="http://witget.com/blog/kak-najti-svoe-prizvanie/%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3D08-01-15">of Oliver Amberton's articles</a> , which can be used to increase <a href="http://witget.com/blog/esli-vy-xotite-sledovat-svoej-mechte-skazhite-net-otvlekayushhim-delam/%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3D08-01-15">personal effectiveness</a> .  And now - to your attention one more material, written by the author especially for those who in 2015 decided to radically change their lives!  The secret of making decisions that are actually made is also the secret of making a hit movie.  So, let Oliver teach you how to create a hit movie (well, or turn your life into an excitingly successful blockbuster). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, our hero lives his usual life.  We would not look at this for too long, but, fortunately, in all the good stories the hero has to go through the door. <br>  The door is something irreversible: once having passed through it, you will not be able to return.  So, in the "Matrix" Neo chose a red pill.  In the "Gravity" space shuttle shattered into small pieces.  And in ‚ÄúShawshank Escape‚Äù an innocent man was sentenced to life imprisonment. <br><br>  The door is a turning point when the story begins.  She puts the hero on a path that he cannot avoid, and psychological stress forces us to continue watching. <br>  Near the end of the story, our hero must pass through the second door, which is also one-way.  But this requires determination and a firm intention.  Passing through this door guarantees the final, whatever it may be.  Our hero must defeat his sworn enemy, or to catch up with his love at the airport, or to defend his desire to dance in spite of the disapproval of his parents.

Once you enter the door, you cannot go back. <br>  And now let me tell you what a bad movie is. <br><br>  Our unfortunate hero wakes up late one December morning and looks in the mirror.  ‚ÄúOh, my God,‚Äù he sighs, looking at his fat reflection.  "In the new year, - I swear, - I will lose weight!" <br><br>  And then he updates his status on Facebook, buys the magazine ‚ÄúRunner's World‚Äù and goes to the gym three times.  The end. <br>  If you want to make a decision (a real decision!), You need to go through the door.  The resourceful, decisive part of you may be depressed, but you know that this will not stop you.  You will take control of the lazy, stupid, reflexive part of yourself later, when the air is cold and you feel a little sick, and if you don‚Äôt come up with something to get this naughty baby out of bed, you lose. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e0/cab/cf8/5e0cabcf81864b38a88aa1de64819709.png" alt="image"><br><br>  You already do it, by the way!  School, for example, is a door through which you cannot but pass, which is why you attend it so successfully.  The same with your work, as well as with your wedding and children.  Doors are irreversible and obligatory, and our society is based on them. <br><br>  So you really want to start your own business?  Try to leave your job, this will provide you with the necessary motivation.  Want to lose weight?  Sign up as a participant in a marathon after 9 months in an interesting country abroad and book plane tickets that cannot be returned.  Or, if it‚Äôs too difficult for you, start participating in a team activity with a specific schedule, leaving you to let others down.  A sense of guilt will support you when your will weakens. <br><br>  Do not run on Facebook to announce your decision.  This will give short-term replenishment of your ego (‚ÄúLook at me! I'm so cool!‚Äù), But it will not particularly affect your behavior (some friends will remember your promise or they will be so tactless that they will catch your word). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7d8/85c/615/7d885c61519e4d85b546e21c19ac8d1f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Involve friends in all ways, but do not create excessive pressure. <br>  And, most importantly, do not make a mistake - do not think that only words about what you want will lead you to the goal.  Almost everyone is befallen with the failure of their New Year's decisions, which is almost as surprising as the words of the spell "Avada Kedavra" do not actually kill people.  Words alone do not help the plan to come true.  Instead, try to go through the door.  And win the game called "Life" (how to do it - <a href="http://witget.com/blog/vsya-zhizn-igra-strategiya-pobedy/%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3D08-01-15">here</a> ). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368303/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368303/</a></p>
