After the files were found and copied, Agava employees were allowed to resume the project. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I would like to say words of gratitude to the Office of the BSTM Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia.  With their direct participation, the investigation process got off the ground and was completed in one day.

      Currently, all service features are available to users.  On the occasion of resolving the problems of the last two days, almost all advertising has been removed from the service, the download speed and file size has been increased.  In this way, Agava wants to thank users for their understanding and patience. <br><br>  We received a lot of letters with the words of support and read a lot of caring blog entries.  This demonstrates how important iFolder‚Äôs non-stop work is.  And yet - about how relevant at the moment is the problem of interaction between hosting companies and owners of web-projects with law enforcement agencies.  It remains for us to hope that this incident will allow us to avoid a repetition of similar situations in the future, and law enforcement officers will begin to treat the interests of the IT company and the needs of Internet users with greater understanding. <br><hr><br>  Additionally from the main page: <a href="http://agava.ru/press/144.shtml">source</a> <br><br>  Friends! <br><br>  Thank you for your patience and support!  Thousands of your letters and blog entries have shown everyone how important the non-stop work of iFolder is. <br><br>  Now, again, the service does not interfere with work, and in honor of this, we decided to increase the already high speed of downloading files to the maximum.  To do this, we temporarily removed most of the ads from the pages, leaving only the one that was placed as part of urgent advertising campaigns.  In addition, we decided that we could handle it, even if the file size limit was raised from 100 to 500 megabytes.  Try it, it should work! <br><br>  We have never fought, we do not fight and have no intention to fight with the law enforcement officers.  We have only successfully challenged redundant, destructive law enforcement, ultimately defending your interests.  iFolder still helps prevent online crime.  His uninterrupted work does not prevent the identification of offenses.  Please do not create problems for yourself and us: do not try to break the law with the help of our service. <br><br>  The iFolder team wishes you good luck and joy! <br><br><hr><br><br>  Open appeal to the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Anatolyevich Medvedev <br><br>  Dear Dmitry Anatolyevich, thank you so much for your attention to our industry.  We are sure that without your support the problem would not have been solved so quickly.  Thanks you. <br><br>  I would like to note that the main damage caused by these actions affected not only us and our clients, but our country as a whole.  Such actions of law enforcement agencies lead to the fact that it is becoming more and more willing to place Internet resources abroad, and not in Russia.  And, it means that servers, jobs and the corresponding financial flows are leaking abroad. <br><br>  We believe that in the current situation a similar incident can happen at any time with any hosting provider.  It is necessary to bring the legal framework in line with modern realities of work on the Internet.  Closing iFolder once again showed that any investigative actions can and should be carried out without stopping sites.  If the state is interested in our proposals in this area, we, like all the hosting community in general, and representatives of our company in particular, are ready to participate in the work on the development of appropriate changes. <br><br>  Congratulations, I consider it a merit of the Russian Internet community. <br><br>  PS <br>  I have no relation to iFolder, a rare user. <br>  Advertising a damn no less ... <br>  For contrast, an article in <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/opinion/news/2010/03/19/972862">Vedomosti</a> with Anton Nosik's comments, and he is doing a <a href="http://dolboeb.livejournal.com/">lot</a> in his <a href="http://dolboeb.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a> ... <br><br>  <strong>I am surprised that my first topic (albeit a reprint), and even in the personal section caused some kind of reaction (-).</strong> <strong><br></strong>  <strong>But I wanted to ask him to place in the section "Hosting", well that was too lazy.</strong> <strong><br></strong>  <strong>I am convinced once again that any policy is ungrateful.</strong> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88306/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88306/</a></p>
