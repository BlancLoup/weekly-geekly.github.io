  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Comparative testing of USB flash drives standard On-The-Go</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For many, in our difficult times, the question arises of expanding the memory of a smartphone or tablet, because in most cases, manufacturers have stopped supplying their products with slots for memory cards of various formats.  "USB flash drives" come to the rescue according to the USB On-The-Go (OTG) standard. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/64e/69f/b87/64e69fb87b174e18a68e197debbeb7fb.png" width="800"><br>  The USB OTG standard has been around for a long time, but only recently many manufacturers have begun to use it to integrate micro USB type A and B connectors and standard USB 2.0 and 3.0 connectors for personal computers.  This saves users when connecting to mobile devices from the need to use USB-to-micro-USB adapters.  Under the cut an easy choice of a small number of models =). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For the review, five flash drives supporting USB OTG were used. <br>  1. Kingston DataTraveler microDuo 64 Gb <br>  2. Kingston DataTraveler microDuo 3.0 64 Gb <br>  3. Leef Bridge 16GB <br>  4. USB Flash AData DashDrive Durable UD320 16Gb <br>  5. Corsair FlashVoyager Go USB3.0 16 Gb <br><br><br>  Each contestant has both disadvantages and advantages.  And I begin, perhaps, with the appearance and usability. <br><br>  <strong>ADATA DashDrive Durable UD320 16Gb</strong>

In addition to direct use, it can serve as an OTG adapter, which allows you to connect any flash drives, card readers or portable HDDs to your smartphone or tablet.  The manufacturer also declares dust, moisture, and impact resistance of this structure.  It took me two minutes to understand that over time the protective cap, without accuracy and proper attention, would simply be lost. <br><br>  <strong>Leef Bridge 16GB</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/98d/5fb/d59/98d5fbd596eaad811c443804c2c474fa.jpg" width="800"><br>  The most overall model.  It really looks like a regular ‚Äúflash drive‚Äù from above.  However, if you turn it upside down, we see two connectors: microUSB and just USB.  Switching between them takes place by pressing and moving to and from oneself, while the dimensions increase in a big way, which, it seems to me, does not add convenience for use with smartphones and tablets.  Probably the only advantage of this model is that it is harder to lose and find than all the others presented in this review. <br><br>  <strong>Corsair Flash Voyager Go USB 3.0</strong> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f10/ccd/07d/f10ccd07da4f4ae2b214882d39d7f391.jpg" width="800"><br>  A tiny piece of aluminum is the most compact flash drive in today's test.  The microUSB connector is closed with a small cap that hangs on the cord supplied in the kit. <br><br><br>  <strong>Kingston DataTraveler microDuo 64 GB</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ea/fe6/9a6/0eafe69a613644deb97f3cf37779cf5f.jpg" width="800"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3fc/f22/c57/3fcf22c57aa14e8abd7775cc3c017f7a.jpg" width="800"><br>  And finally, the most convenient for me flash drive.  Initially, the drive looks like a USB flash drive for connecting to a computer or laptop, but the case can be transformed and accessed by a small MicroUSB connector, for installation in a tablet or smartphone that has only this connector for external storage devices. <br><br>  <strong>Kingston DataTraveler microDuo USB 3.0 64 GB</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0fc/614/de2/0fc614de238641b385a0d01e7f43255f.jpg" width="800"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a59/faf/3fd/a59faf3fde2d45418019a8cac51cf8b3.jpg" width="800"><br><br><br>  Full analog of his brother with USB 2.0 - a little plastic cap is different and of course access speed. <br><br><br>  <strong>Tests</strong> <br><br>  It is possible to divide the indicators into three groups: USB 3.0 flash drives from Corsair and Kingston - the leaders are not only on paper, the tests also show the advantage of these brands.  And the "redhead" flash drive is significantly ahead of the "pirate" comrade.  USB 2.0 flash drives from ADATA and Kingston showed the most decent results and if you consider that the priority of use is mobile devices, then this will be quite enough.  But the flash drive from Leef showed a very bad result.  Especially in the tests for reading and writing a file weighing 4.7 Gb.  Surprisingly, I specifically checked on different PCs and the results differed, but still they did not reach their rivals. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2f6/2a1/73a/2f62a173ac554a16bf534500de88f43c.png" width="800"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/46d/09c/31d/46d09c31d06a42579b5df1a93f3c1dd0.png" width="800"><br><br>  For the tests, the ultrabook MicroXperts U400-09 was used, for playing video files - Android smartphone - Samsung Galaxy S4 <br><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td>  CPU </td><td>  Intel Core i5-4210U </td></tr><tr><td>  RAM </td><td>  8 Gb DDR3-1600 Kingston <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Graphic system </td><td>  Intel HD Graphics 4400 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Storage system </td><td>  Kingston V300 240 Gb <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  According to the results, I state the following: Samsung Galaxy S4 is indifferent to the brand of the flash drive, it played back a 4.7 Gb video file with the same pleasure from all drives.  But in terms of recording speeds, the difference is very significant - the leader Kingston microDuo 3.0 64 Gb, then Corsair Flash Voyager Go, followed by Kingston microDuo, then ADATA, and closes the back of the field - Leef.  Which is characteristic of Leef, I have already tested it in the spring, and the instance ‚Äúdeteriorated‚Äù over time - apparently the flash memory was tired or some problems with the controller arose (the flash drive‚Äôs life had passed the last six months not in front of me). <br><br>  <strong>Conclusion</strong> <br><br>  Among the five drives, I would highlight Kingston DataTraveler microDuo USB 3.0 64 GB.  Convenience and size, these are the qualities that should be considered when working with gadgets, plus a solid metal case and a minimum of moving parts (by the way, if you wish, you can detach the plastic cap altogether).  Full analog of this device, but with USB 2.0 you can consider if you want to save a couple of hundred rubles, or if you do not have USB 3.0 ports on your computer.  However, the Adata flash drive still has one advantage, it can be used as an adapter for other drives, which is actually a huge plus.  Leef USB flash drive did not impress me at all, its large size, which increases even more when using one of the two plugs.  Corsair has a small size and decent performance, but it is still slower than Kingston. <br>  After all these conclusions and speed tests, we can conclude that the advantage still remains with Kingston, especially when working with gadgets. <br>  <b>UPD.</b>  <b>Prices on Yandex.Market</b> <br>  1. Kingston DataTraveler microDuo 64 Gb - <a href="">1694 rubles for 64 GB</a> and <a href="">430 rubles for 16 GB</a> <br>  2. Kingston DataTraveler microDuo 3.0 64 Gb - <a href="">1667 rubles for 64 GB</a> and <a href="">521 rubles for 16 GB</a> <br>  3. Leef Bridge 16GB - <a href="">780 rubles</a> <br>  4. USB Flash AData DashDrive Durable UD320 16Gb - <a href="">550 rubles</a> <br>  5. Corsair FlashVoyager Go USB3.0 16 Gb - <a href="">1190 rubles</a> <br>  Now everything becomes quite obvious;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/239701/">https://habr.com/ru/post/239701/</a></p>
