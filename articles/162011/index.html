Part 2: Bloody Mary</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>Continued.</i>  <i>The first part is the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/162005">Black Death</a> .</i> <br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cce/dcc/26b/ccedcc26b2d9590df646e92f2b07d389.jpg" title="Part of the genealogical tree of the Tudor dynasty" align="left">  On May 23, 1553, the Archbishop of Canterbury declared invalid the marriage of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon, officially making their daughter Maria Tudor a bastard.  Catherine was a Catholic and enjoyed the location of the Pope, who did not give permission for divorce.  Henry VIII wanted Catherine to give birth to a son to him, but all their children, except Mary, died during or immediately after the birth, which eventually destroyed their marriage. <br><br>  Henry divorced the most decisive and thorough way - he became a Protestant, and at the same time and all of England brought out from under the influence of Rome, founding the Anglican Church and becoming its head.  After that, he married and divorced several more times.  From his second marriage he had a daughter, Elizabeth, and from the third, his son Edward.  Unlike Mary, the remaining Catholic, they grew up to be Protestants. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Edward inherited the throne in 1547, at the age of nine, but died before reaching the age of majority.  Mary managed to become queen after him, despite the fact that she was declared illegitimate.  She ascended the throne in 1553. <br><br>  She had not spoken to her father for many years and had seen her mission in canceling the outrage he had committed against True Faith, England and her mother, and to return the country to the bosom of the Catholic Church.  She ruthlessly pursued the Protestants, publicly executed several hundred people, for which she received the nickname Bloody Mary.

      She shared Catholic concerns about typography.  The ability of people to quickly and massively disseminate information threatened her intentions to restore Catholicism, mainly because of the ability of Protestants to print heretical books (at that time religious books were of great political importance).  Seeing the unsuccessful, despite the threat of the death penalty, attempts to ban typography in France, she came up with a solution that would be beneficial not only to the authorities, but also to the owners of printing houses. <br><br>  She introduced a monopoly.  The London Guild of Printers was granted the exclusive right to any printing work in England.  Instead, printers had to coordinate with the authorities all the materials before they were published.  Such a monopoly was very beneficial to both parties - the printers earned good money, and, to the delight of the censors, vigilantly watched any attempts to circumvent the restrictions.  Such a symbiosis of the state and corporate sectors proved to be a very effective tool for suppressing freedom of speech and religious dissidence. <br><br>  This monopoly was given to the London Booksellers Company on May 4, 1557.  It was called the "copyright". <br><br>  Cooperation with the book industry has worked much better than a complete ban on typography in the form of an order.  Booksellers began to play the role of a private censorship authority - they burned illegal books, confiscated or destroyed the equipment of violators of the monopoly, effectively preventing the publication of material that was unprofitable to the authorities.  They quickly learned to independently determine which material could be printed, and which could not, and the authorities had to intervene only occasionally. <br><br>  Readers' demand was high, and London booksellers rowed money with a shovel.  If there was nothing seditious in books, why not let people read them?  It was beneficial to both the queen and publishers. <br><br>  Mary I Tudor died the following year, November 17, 1558. The throne passed to her Protestant sister Elizabeth, whose rule was one of the most glorious periods in the history of England.  Mary's attempts to restore Catholicism failed.  But the copyright invented by her is still alive. <br><br>  The third part: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/162077/">Monopoly dies ... and is reborn</a> . <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/162011/">https://habr.com/ru/post/162011/</a></p>
