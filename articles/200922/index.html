I decided to pump slightly - that way in two. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2aa/055/ebb/2aa055ebb2db21e861a3fd6d8986c506.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Here are both handsome. <br><br>  To update.  I decided to use a proprietary program from Samsung - Data Migration.  I downloaded the latest version, installed it.  The new SSD did not connect, and "drove" the computer into Sleep ... <br><br>  And he went to sleep. <br><br><h4>  Death </h4><br><br>  In the morning, I turned on the computer, checked my mail and Skype.  For everything about all 2 minutes.  And went to work.  Comp stayed to live their lives ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a2f/75d/42d/a2f75d42d7e87b9f776096d0bc218de8.jpg"><br>  I arrived in the evening.  I watch the computer hangs immediately after the BIOS initializes the devices in the system boot state.  I went into the BIOS.  It turned out the system tried to boot from a photo flash drive, on which, naturally, it was not installed.  Changed the boot order ... The computer has booted.  Everything seems to be good.  But after 5 minutes, Windows 8 hung, crashed into BSOD and restarted the computer. <br><br>  Silicon Power SSD is not defined "bios". <br><br><h4>  Funeral </h4><br>  After a complete power outage and juggling loops, SSD came to life.  The system has booted.  But she lived exactly 5 minutes, and BSOD ... <br><br>  The whole evening was dancing with a tambourine: <br><ul><li>  The screw was connected to another computer; </li><li>  Tried to make a copy of the sections on the new screw; </li><li>  Tried to create an image of partitions; </li><li>  Stitched screw with different firmware; </li><li>  Even nothing done. </li></ul><br>  But as soon as 5 minutes passed, the SSD fell off.  Just disappeared from the device or disconnected if it was under DOS. <br><br><h4>  Bury can not pump out </h4><br>  I call to friends on the service.  I want to put a comma in the title.  They say: "We are killing such SSDs and changing them under warranty." <br>  So all the same, he died.  Bury! <br><br>  Moving files manually.  5 minute sessions. <br><br>  At the move stage, a strange file was found, deep in the subfolders of the Users folder.  One thing was strange in this file - the name is too long, very similar to the script code.  Neither deleted nor copied, he did not want.  Skipping this file, I moved the rest.  Through the console, deleted the Users folder with the <code>rd /s/q Users</code> Users command, along with a strange file.  Just like that - just in case.  <b>... And it took 10 minutes.</b> <br><br>  Then I have 8 minutes of ‚ÄúVipal with zeros‚Äù free space ... <b>20 minutes have passed</b> , the SSD is working. <br><br>  STRANGE! <br>  He is dead <b>YES</b> or <b>NO</b> .  Or the information recorded on the SSD affects the SSD itself.  But nobody addressed this unfortunate file, especially under DOS.  What side can it affect the work of the drive, just being on it.  <b>Impossible!</b>  But the indisputable fact is that: <br><br><blockquote>  A file with a strange long name like a script code that is simply located on an SSD can disable its controller.  No need to even contact him. </blockquote><br><br>  Unthinkable logic.  Most likely it is enough that the data from the name of this file passed through the controller when updating the disk partitioning control records.  I think this process takes 5 minutes and leaves. <br>  URA comrades ... Now the information in the stone affects the stone itself. <br><br><h4>  Resurrection </h4><br>  I uploaded the moved files back.  I connected the SSD to my native computer.  The system lives on. <br><br>  5 minutes. <br><br>  10 minutes. <br><br>  5 o'clock. <br>  And I am writing my first article on Habrahabr ... <br><br><h4>  Exposing </h4><br>  But where did this file come from?  Is there a virus or backdoor? <br><br>  But when did this happen?  As soon as Data Migration was established ... Or is this a coincidence? <br>  Maybe the manufacturer of drives knows about this possibility? <br><br>  I really want to read the opinion of the Habr community. <br>  I would like to see the full name of the unfortunate file that was so suddenly removed by me.  It began with a "0" (zero). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/200922/">https://habr.com/ru/post/200922/</a></p>
