      TL / DR - nothing new, just specialists who pay for the Internet and <a href="">go</a> to the <a href="">leading technical-political website do not want to be sent to Google to look for unfamiliar words,</a> are met at the first stage by the same experts on a particularly rich inner world. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  For a start it is worth knowing how the world works.  It is quite common that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DXInSHD-NF7I">Vishnu is asleep, he dreams of Brahma, and Brahma dreams of everything else.</a> <br><br>  <b>In the case of IT arrangement, the situation is simple</b> , which I already wrote about in the absence of an analogous taxpayer. <br><br>  There is a small business, a medium business, and a bloody enterprise. <br><br>  There is the first line - plug-in mice and image flooders, including the question " <i>why don't we pour the ZVER DVD, these citizens in the parent French organization don't understand anything</i> " (the opinion of another Eugene, by the way). <br><br>  There is a second line - cloud mining specialists, like our favorite hero, Eugene, and the third line, which has to work with its head. <br><br>  In small and medium business, the first, second and third lines are combined in one person, which is also coming. <br><br>  On average, where as, sometimes the second and third lines are still spaced apart, the first one also accepts requests for the desk service. <br><br>  In a bloody enterprise, a qualitative leap begins when the network and, say, storage systems are engaged in different people. <br><br>  <b>Determine your own technical level</b> can be based on the ratio of the number of current Pearson VUE certificates multiplied by the statistics in tanks (rakabliki, Vovka, line, Eva - to taste) for the last month, divided by the number of comments on the Habr√© for the same time. <br><br>  After this simple exercise, you need to understand a few simple things. <br><br>  - If in a small / medium-sized business you can still imagine yourself second after Big Boss, then in KE (a home-based enterprise) you are just another employee.  There is nothing of yours here, you sell your time and experience, everything. <br><br>  There was a need for a link to the reddit, which I lost in a naval way, which I regret. <br><br>  - IT is (mostly) not a key profit-generating element.  Organization, even with a complete failure in the entire server warp, will be able to work in one form or another.  The key element of IT here will not be mail, but the system of organizing the issue of invoices for shipment and bank client. <br><br>  - The majority of vacancies are related to small / medium business, and here (in my opinion) there is a sharp misunderstanding of the state of the labor market on both sides, the applicant and the employer. <br>  In the case of the applicant, there is often an inflated self-conceit (with inverse correlation with the number of certificates), in the case of the employer, a standard misunderstanding that their organization is not unique from any side. <br><br>  <b>Now, since you've read this far, my valuable opinion on the above voiced questions will be.</b> <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúWhy haven't I called back?‚Äù</b> <br><br>  Necessary note: the following text comes from the idea that you are, in fact, not in your opinion, roughly correspond to the vacancy.  If you don‚Äôt meet at all, let's say you‚Äôve been involved in email all your life, but you don‚Äôt know the foreach construct ($ a in $ b), or came to the devops interview - although you don‚Äôt distinguish between an inner join and vimautomation.core. call back <br><br>  There may be a lot of options, the simplest and most frequently encountered recently (except for the inconsistency described above) - the employee is not needed.  Not exactly you are not needed, but in general an employee is not needed for this place. <br><br>  As it happens - yes, just.  There is a department staff, say 5 people.  Tasks are carried out by four, with overlapping for the period of holidays and illnesses.  There is a place where you need to dial someone. <br>  But if you dial someone, it will be difficult to push off from the new, strange tasks that come from above.  Immediately, the staff as a whole copes, real tasks are accomplished, and at meetings we can safely say that yes, we are of course pleased, but you can see for yourself that the department is overloaded, and there‚Äôs no need for someone to come up to us.  ¬Ø \ _ („ÉÑ) _ / ¬Ø <br><br>  There are exceptions of the form ‚Äúforgotten‚Äù or ‚Äúearned‚Äù, or ‚Äúthey give feedback to consider their own dignity,‚Äù but these are the exceptions of the DNIWE level.  If the worker is NECESSARY, then that it is necessary to contact him will be reminded at all levels. <br><br>  There is one more exception, when more or less suitable candidates are more than two, but one is ready to come out in a week, but wants a little more money, and the second in 3 weeks, but it seems and knows more.  In this case, they can only call the first one, but if he refuses, then SUDDENLY recall the second one. <br><br>  More exceptions to practice: <br><br><ul><li>  You are overclocked (Why were you called for an interview then? Hoping that the resume is 50% water?); </li><li>  oh, thank you for calling: you are right for us and we are ready to offer, we just lost your resumes and contacts. </li></ul><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  If you do not call back (did not write) in 3-5 business days, then you, as an employee, are not really needed here.  You can (and should) write / call yourself, in the format ‚ÄúI wanted to remind myself‚Äù, but this is a form of politeness and no more, it does not affect the decision making. <br><br>  Moreover, if suddenly and suddenly this approach will matter, then the situation in the organization is even worse than you thought - the decision on hiring and filter is made by HR, and the head of the department is not interested in this question (hiring).  See above - the worker is not needed. <br><br>  <b>- Why in the vacancies often do not write a salary, but only the requirements?</b> <br><br>  Oh, this is a very interesting question, and the answer to it can be stated simply - GREED, OTHER GREED, and ANOTHER GREED. <br><br><h3>  Greed number one </h3><br>  Market condition. <br><br>  IT does not bring direct profit, remember these simple and instructive words.  Accordingly, it is not necessary to index the salary, and it was also useless to look for an employee for a salary ‚Äúhigher than three years ago when the dismissed specialist had gone‚Äù.  However, HR is usually not quite fools, and they understand that in three years inflation in the Russian Federation is 25 percent (real), and of the intangible buns they offer only pride, prejudice and the honor to work in a big successful company, the winner of the contest - 2012 ".  So it remains only to first drag the employee to an interview, and then we will see if he suddenly agrees, maybe this is his job at his home, or he needs to STRAIGHT. <br><br><h3>  Greed number two </h3><br>  The situation on the Moscow market (I will not say about the rest of the cities) is that the salary offered may differ by 2-3 times, depending on the company.  There is no uniform tariff scale, there are some approximate boundaries, but they are very blurred.  As a result, you can always try to push an employee for less money ‚Äúby the results of an interview.‚Äù <br><br><h3>  Greed number three, or what happens if you show an overestimated salary </h3><br>  The story of life, by the way. <br><br>  In 2014, a new data center was opened.  We put a vacancy with an open salary of 150 (thousand rubles). <br><br>  The task was such, to go through a small ridge and catch the right candidate ... They wanted, as always - all at once, networker, Linux + ms. <br><br>  1500 people passed, and found NO ONE. <br><br>  This taught them NOT to show money, because you show, you will receive + 40% of local administrators, who simply see + 20-30% of their sn, click and spend your time, because  they are not ready to close a job vacancy <br><br><h3>  Others why, or how to save both your own and other people's time </h3><br>  This piece is written under the influence of both the opinions of colleagues and the experience of the last correspondence interview. <br><br>  Before further reading, you should read the older one - <a href="https://habr.com/post/334442/">Interviews, the labor market, etc. in the city of Moscow. Arr.</a>  <a href="https://habr.com/post/334442/">summer 7525</a> <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/post/334212/">Intangible motivation - what is included there</a> <br><br>  <b>First, about the last entertaining experience.</b> <br><br>  As some people know, I am now sitting on the first vacation in the first normal for the last couple of years, finishing all sorts of long-running things, teaching the materiel (actually, writing this text) and starting September 24 to go to a new job.  So, opening a resume, I was faced with an interesting ‚Äúfor me‚Äù and ‚Äúthere wasn‚Äôt before‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>1 - HR bots.</b> <br><br>  HR took out, automata everywhere set in a new wave of the bottom (DNIWA) among automated HR. <br><br>  The first wave was when I was sent just copy-paste from HH. <br><br>  The second wave looked like this - they send two vacancies ‚Äúblah blah, work at work, payment by interview‚Äù. <br><br>  I am writing back - you sent me a job here, and how many forks? <br><br>  The answer comes "we already have the final candidate, thanks for the letter." <br><br>  Then this vacancy was sent another 2-3 times, well done. <br><br>  I do not know who developed these bots, but this is an adaptation of regular spam to hh.ru.  I don‚Äôt know how these bots interact with hh, brute force, or like with E-Staff, when hh tech support cannot answer me how to prohibit the transfer of my resume to this excellent softphone. <br><br>  I explain: E-Staff tracks the ‚Äújob vacancy-employee‚Äù link, and as soon as you update your resume and upload it to E-Staff, they will see this update.  Setting "do not show my resume campaigns" - in my opinion it does not matter.  What will happen next - depends on the boss, how soon this wonderful news will be told to him, which you probably did not want to tell him. <br><br>  In particular, such a useful feature is used in one club of fans of yellow software, when it is immediately visible when a former employee has posted an updated resume. <br><br>  <b>2 - freelance HR.</b> <br><br>  This is generally an amazing thing.  Almost the same as HR bots, only worse. <br>  Bot he is a bot, why offended him?  Freelance is different. <br>  For example, some citizen writes to me, these are vacancies, would you like to. <br>  I answer, so that he voiced that as in more detail, because hh I read and so I can. <br>  The man disappears. <br>  I am waiting for a week, I write "well, how is it all chtoli"? <br>  He wakes up, replies that he is guilty, and corrected, and everyone will like it, just like Saddam and Satan.  We call up each other, and he reads out loud to me, according to the list from the vacancy, about all sorts of technologies.  And my TOEFL is directly listed in my resume with 119 points, but the recruiter asks ‚Äúwhat level of English‚Äù. <br><br>  Or, for example, in my top line of the resume is worth the version (which I use, although it can be crooked and can be much better and faster) - but the recruiter asks if I know him well. <br>  So I know what ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù means from the point of view of someone?  Maybe there is a lover of one-liners and any hotkeys, such as $ old |  % {Remove-Item $ _. SPBackupDirectory -Recurse} " <br>  You can see the list of get-alias yourself, it does not add readability, and speed also. <br><br>  <b>3 - Like a large company, and at the entrance sits HR with a horoscope.</b> <br><br>  It seems to me that the situation is simple - <ul><li>  any sane manager knows that, for the most part, HR can only count the number of hands, legs and eyes of a candidate. </li><li>  accordingly, as soon as the search for further primary selection is entrusted to HR, it means that the employee is rather not needed, see above </li><li>  you can evaluate whether or not an employee is needed - on the instructions of the salary in the open form (this increases the percentage of non-poetic by 50% in the primary selection and the burden on the interviewee), or by answering the salary range.  More precisely, about the lack of an answer, with the translation of the theme "voiced successful and motivated." </li></ul><br>  Swam already, we know. <br><br>  However, suddenly, in some large firms, it would seem that there is trouble even with primary dropouts - when you ask what the salary forks are, tasks, bonuses, studies, bonuses like working from home (see <a href="https://habr.com/post/334212/">Intangible Motivation - what is included</a> ) - and you get the answer first that work in our company is in itself a great honor, and in the second phase, when you write, ‚Äúwell, you know, somehow it‚Äôs not interesting‚Äù - you get a letter, ‚Äúwell, you don‚Äôt understand, blah blah.‚Äù <br><br>  Well, yes, of course, not so. <br><br>  The result is that the average HR even in a large (seemingly) company is <br><br><ul><li>  filter with implicit input parameters.  HR can have the roof shifted on horoscopes, some lines in the resume, anything, and you will not know the real reason for the refusal even before the technical interview, do not waste time trying to understand. </li><li>  therefore, a normal manager should control the dropout rate.  If the dropout rate is above 20%, then something is wrong with HR. </li><li>  for an already settled employee that HR is, what is not - HR‚Äôs opinion is not in the salary line, there are no bonuses (I‚Äôll leave the question of sexual relations behind the scenes), all that is there is a drain on the fact that the employee updated his resume.  Discharge may be delayed from 2 days to 2 weeks. </li></ul><br>  <b>3.1 In general, with the summary plum, the situation is interesting, much more interesting than I thought a couple of years ago.</b> <br><br>  Who watched the film "The Sphere" / The Circle, that little aware of what it was about. <br><br>  Thesis: <br><br><ul><li>  Merging someone else's resume into a closed general chat / HR group is a common practice. </li><li>  No less common thing for recruitment agencies / gaskets is to receive an application from the office, take an open resume of the employee from the same office, and send them. </li><li>  Black lists of employees have not gone away and are healthy.  At 152-FZ in this issue look in any way. </li><li>  The funniest thing starts when these closed blacklists are pushed online.  Cases have already been. </li></ul><br>  <b>The conclusion on how to save time at this stage:</b> <br><br>  - if in HR correspondence it does not consider it necessary to answer the direct question about the salary fork, then you can not even spend your time, most likely that the amount indicated by you "in hands" will be much higher than the budget. <br><br>  As a result, the interview will either be boring and at the end will sound completely different numbers, or will try to push the amount lower in the style of ‚Äúwe are honored to work‚Äù, or ‚Äúbut we have a vending machine, you can buy a chocolate bar‚Äù. <br><br>  - If already at the first stage of the interview starts are visits like ‚ÄúPlan - law, fulfillment - duty, overfulfilment - honor!‚Äù  (C) Two torn down towers ‚Äù, or‚Äú our processing is generally a standard of living ‚Äù- then you should ask, and what in return?  What about processing fees?  If at this stage the interlocutor changes abruptly in the face, changes shoes in a jump and says that their corporate culture is not accepted to be asked at once - that's all, you can move the chair back and say "it was interesting, I will call you back." <br><br>  So it goes. <br><br>  I‚Äôll write separately about what kind of administrators of localhost sometimes come to the interview. <br>  Outstanding personalities, frankly. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422741/">https://habr.com/ru/post/422741/</a></p>
