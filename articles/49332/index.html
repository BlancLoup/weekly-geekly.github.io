Although some of the genetic traits associated with this story will still make themselves felt in this and other notes <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D129764">in the beginner series</a> on SharePoint.  In particular, these genetic traits affect everything related to terminology, in which, to put it simply, anyone encountering a product for the first time can simply ‚Äúbreak legs‚Äù. <br><br>  In this section, again broken down into two notes, we will talk about how an advanced Web 2.0 user who is familiar with a wide variety of social networking resources sees SharePoint and is now embarking on this Microsoft product.  Immediately I warn you that at first it will be very difficult for such a user, hence my desire, if possible, to help the user will not be easy.  The information with which you meet in this article, you will not always be able to extract from the documentation, and sometimes they are simply not there. <br><br>  Experiments will not help either - the <b>system is very large and complex</b> .  Difficult in the sense that it combines a huge number of a wide variety of functions and services, to get to all the nuances of which you are unlikely to immediately succeed.  Especially if you want to carry out the experiments themselves on a subset of the maximum possible edition of MOSS-2007.  For example, on trial versions, free MSS or its relatively cheap cloud version of SharePoint Online.

      Everywhere below, unless otherwise indicated, when speaking about SharePoint, I will refer to the target system installed by the system administration of the server (or server farm / server farm) based on the latest version of MOSS 2007 (in its most advanced edition).  At the same time, we believe that all additional products that are included in the SharePoint family and / or are necessary for its use are also installed along the way. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Six SharePoint Pillars </h4><br>  Let me remind you that SharePoint is a system designed to work in companies and organizations.  Here it is intended to solve (or help solve) the following tasks: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <i><b>Main tasks</b></i> : <br>  - <b>Content management</b> (content management) in all its diversity; <br>  - <b>Management of business processes</b> in terms of maintaining schedules (workflow) of their passage and preparation, filling in and using various kinds of formalized documents (forms); <br>  - <b>Business Intelligence (Business Intelligence / BI)</b> - the collection, streamlining and reporting of information from various external and internal sources, and necessary for production activities. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <i><b>Supporting tasks</b></i> : <br>  - <b>Online search of</b> information stored in various electronic storages used by the company and / or in all available external resources; <br>  - <b>Cooperation</b> , ensuring effective interaction of the company's employees with each other and with external partners in the process of generating production and / or project information, documenting and using it. <br><br>  <b>Portal concept.</b>  The services necessary for solving all the listed tasks are in one way or another provided to users through the <b>hierarchical system of sites</b> .  Microsoft itself defined such an approach as a concept of portals and even at first included the word ‚Äúportal‚Äù in the product name of the SharePoint <i>Portal</i> Server line, which I mentioned in previous notes.  The entire set of SharePoint sites in one company was also called a portal (target portal). <br><br>  In the full name of MOSS 2007 (hereinafter simply - MOSS), as you have already noticed, the word ‚Äúportal‚Äù has disappeared.  In recent corporate documents, this word is also almost never found, however, it remains in many of the old documents included in the MOSS documentation set, and continues to wander through various other sources, which often causes misunderstandings.  For example, both at Microsoft and elsewhere you can even read that the concept of portals refers to the six pillars on which SharePoint rests (the five other pillars are the tasks listed above). <br>  On SharePoint, you can see from different angles, ‚Äúclimbing‚Äù on any of these pillars.  This will be a view from, above all, the end user.  You can also look at this product as a whole, as it is seen by the system administrator and web application programmer, who develops the system for the needs of his company or creates various types of SharePoint extensions. <br><br>  In a preliminary view, each such ‚Äúlook‚Äù can be formed only after processing the mass of materials (almost, as the poet said, speaking of finding ‚Äúgrams of radium in tons of ore‚Äù).  As for the final look, he will come to you, of course, only after practical work with the system. <br><br>  Let's start with what I think today my typical reader is most prepared for - let's take a look at SharePoint from the ‚Äúpillar‚Äù that Microsoft called collaboration.  In other words, as I said, this is <b>Enterprise 2.0</b> , or Web 2.0 social networking services in a business environment.  However, we, naturally, cannot do without an understanding of the Microsoft ‚Äúportal concept‚Äù in its current interpretation. <br><br>  <i>Read the full section (with all the necessary links and an extended list of recommended sources):</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i><a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D131688">Subsection1</a> :</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- We are starting the structuring of the system ...</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Finish structuring, or Ning behind the corporate wall</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i><a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D132063">Subsection2</a> :</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- General methods of creating websites, or to each his own</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- All in one and all for one</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Personal site, or My ‚ÄúI‚Äù in the context of business relations</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Collective site - a platform for team play</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/49332/">https://habr.com/ru/post/49332/</a></p>
