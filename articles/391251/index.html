  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The evolution of smartphones. Part 1: 1994 - 2010</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Back in 2013, I published an article <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/191640/">Old Advertising of Cell Phones and Smartphones (from the 1980s to the end of the 2000s)</a> , where you can watch the brightest phones from the 1980s. <br><br>  But this time I want to trace exactly the smartphones - communicators, smart phones, phablets, shades and other devices of the same type, the mere definition of which caused battles among geeks.  And so you need to start with IBM Simon, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/233751/">released over 20 years ago</a> .  Then we move on to Symbian devices, the appearance of the first iPhone and the first Android smartphone from HTC, recall the devices from Nokia and end the journey with the latest gadgets introduced in 2016. <br><br>  <b>In the comments, please share your memories and provide links to your own reviews.</b> <b>

This futuristic for the time a mixture of a computer and a telephone without a keyboard, but with a touch screen, combined in itself a mobile phone, a pager, an organizer, mail, an alarm clock.  The gadget worked on a 16-bit Vadem VG-230 16 MHz processor.  By the way, there was a whole MB of RAM here.  Want to see what's inside?

This is the Ericsson R380, another gadget with a large 3.7-inch touchscreen display and on the Symbian operating system.  Prior to this, Ericsson did many handheld computers without the ability to call and phones without being able to use them as computers.  ‚ÄúWe call it a smartphone,‚Äù the ad says. <br><br>  The device was presented to the world in December 1999, and in 2000 they began to sell. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/pxirrVQb5oI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgmgQjV2yIDzhCX5lhN1qhFbVI7Sg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/comment_images/cf0/da5/fba/cf0da5fbad586947b43bbd802c5d49aa.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Blackberry 5810 </h4><br>  The history of Blackberry began in 1984, when Mike Lazaridis, a student at the University of Waterloo, registered RIM - Research In Motion.  The company began with the design of devices for wireless data transmission, and since the 1990s, borrowed text transmission technology in paging networks from Ericsson and RAM Mobile Data, and then released a pager with a QWERTY-keyboard that allows you to send messages.  Further, most Blackberry devices looked exactly like this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/28b/5e1/6e8/28b5e16e890df2c5c23d985e420a5282.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  The first Blackberry smartphone appeared in 2002.

We released a gadget on Symbian OS 6.0 in 2002, but I still remember how I wanted to get one.  And I do not know what I would do with it? <br><br>  Nokia 9210 could boast a color screen of 640x200 pixels, 8 MB of RAM and 14 MB of internal memory.

We decided to take action.  We believe that competition in the market is healthy, but competitors should create their own unique technologies, and not steal ours. </blockquote><br>  This press release <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/86118/">with the announcement of HTC War, the</a> Taiwanese company gave a logical answer: <blockquote>  We only became aware of Apple‚Äôs intentions from the press release.  The court document has not yet been served, so we cannot comment on the charges yet.  We respect the value of patent rights, but we also want to protect our own innovations.  We invent and patent our own technologies for more than 13 years. </blockquote><br>  The list of devices that allegedly violated Apple‚Äôs patents included Nexus One, Touch Pro, Touch Diamond, Touch Pro2, Tilt II, Pure, Imagio, Dream / G1, myTouch 3G, Hero, HD2 and Droid Eris.  And this can be called recognition by Apple. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ut8ACYCYgSo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhecJqJxFBjT76ISL-clBqbya493w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a1d/ac3/a14/a1dac3a146e0cbf02a34193e57600846.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0d1/cdd/f93/0d1cddf938205fb8a9201721cba50a44.png" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Samsung galaxy </h4><br>  Korean smartphone Samsung announced its first smartphone in the Galaxy line on April 27, 2009, a few days after the launch of HTC Dream sales.
