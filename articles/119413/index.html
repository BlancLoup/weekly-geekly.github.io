  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IClebo Smart Robot Vacuum Cleaners</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I think that many of you have heard of such an interesting device as a robot vacuum cleaner.  Those who imagine what he looks like, most likely, recall models from the American company <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRobot">iRobot</a> .  But besides iRobot, there are other brands on the market.  In particular, one of the interesting firms that produce robotic vacuum cleaners is the Korean company Yujin Robot.  She releases iClebo models.  About the most recent development of Yujin Robot and about the vacuum cleaner robots in general, I will talk a little about in this article. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/186/81b/88118681b33c7fa0e69759e60f4f7d26.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The company was founded in 1988 in Korea.  Among the products there are such interesting developments as, for example: iRobi.  This is a home robot that responds to voice commands, displays on the display the weather forecast and the latest news, sings karaoke, etc. There is such a miracle about $ 3000. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e29/ea3/7b6/e29ea37b6a7ef810b72a150913de67c6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  With the growing popularity of iRobot, the Korean company decided to also enter the market of automatic cleaners and introduced a line of iClebo models.  Modern models: <br>  <b>Home series</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/be2/eed/7bf/be2eed7bf126638f3f6f632438142757.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>and smart</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d66/a31/bfe/d66a31bfeb32bc77aaea6549b7b84c61.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The first differ from the more advanced lack of the possibility of forming a room map. <br><br>  <b>Something about the robot vacuum cleaners</b> <br>  In modern urban rhythm of life, sometimes there is no time for regular maintenance of the order and cleanliness of the apartment.  But thanks to robotics, these problems have been resolved.  Now the owner of the apartment can program the regular cleaning of rooms for a week ahead and calmly go about her private affairs.  Moreover, given the autonomy of the robot, you can program it for cleaning during the day, during working hours when there is no one at home.  We come home, and there ... clean and everything shines!  Well, not exactly, of course, but there will definitely not be dust on the floor.  Ideal option to buy two vacuum cleaners: for dry cleaning and for wet cleaning.  Then the carpets will be clean, and kitchen tiles.  The fact is that at the same time, no model is able to vacuum and clean floors at the same time.  Therefore, as a first option, you should pay attention to iRobot Roomba, iClebo, Neato.  As a vacuum cleaner for wet cleaning, look towards the iRobot Scooba. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5ca/176/cba/5ca176cba2913bd17b035d79c743eb9f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Modern robots vacuum cleaners themselves move through the rooms, linger on more polluted places, if necessary, become the base for recharging.  Usually they are round and in order to reach the corners they use a rotating brush that sweeps the dust out of the corners.  A big plus of such vacuum cleaners is the ability to climb into hard to reach places.  For example, under the sofa or bed (height 9.5 cm). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/336/153/f2a/336153f2a4322f888fbcdf1fce1cac76.jpg" alt="image"><br>  For those who consider the robot vacuum cleaner a simple toy, I dare to dissuade it.  According to numerous reviews and personal experience of use (albeit small), the robot copes very well with its function.  How does he do it, given that the average power is several times less than that of a conventional vacuum cleaner? <br><br>  The secret lies in the fact that: 1) robotic vacuum cleaners use brushes that lift the pile, wind up wool and after that the motor sucks in dust 2) robots sometimes pass through polluted places several times.  IRobot 505 Motion Map: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e15/ee4/ccd/e15ee4ccddf6554c600eb9b205827416.jpg" alt="image">

      The ideal option is when you vacuum your vacuum cleaner once a week in the usual way and between two or three times a week you program a cleaning robot. <br><br>  Of the troubles, we can note the complexity of the automatic cleaning in the presence of many wires on the floor and high pile.  In the first case, in many models there are anti-tangle systems.  When driving on the wires and winding them around the brush, the robot slowly begins to rotate the brushes in the opposite direction, freeing them.  Specially placed the vacuum cleaner on the set of wires: 4 times out of 5, he got out himself.  In the second case, while salvation is not invented.  High pile carpets are not amenable to cleaning any model. <br><br>  In addition to the above features, robot vacuum cleaners are equipped with a variety of sensors to prevent collisions with furniture and walls, as well as falling from stairs.  Additional benefits include: <br><br>  - The robot vacuum cleaner is not silent, but a little quieter than standard vacuum cleaners. <br>  - In winter, in cloudy weather, you will most likely need light for cleaning with a standard vacuum cleaner - to see what is being vacuumed.  The robot vacuum cleaner, of course, does not need light, which saves additional electricity. <br><br>  <b>About iClebo Smart</b> <br>  Unfortunately, I did not have time to take photos and videos of the vacuum cleaner during the time it was in my hands, so the illustrations will be from the Internet.  But I will share some conclusions on this model. <br><br>  iClebo Smart is the oldest and most advanced development of a Korean company.  The abbreviation Smart is responsible for the presence of a built-in camera, with the help of which the robot cleaner forms a room map.  The camera constantly photographs the ceiling and walls, the image is processed and thus the robot builds its route.  Other vacuum cleaners (including the Home model) pass pre-formed trajectories in the form of zigzag, spirals, and chaotic movement.  On the one hand, they can go through one section several times, which improves the quality of cleaning of the place.  On the other hand, the robot can leave a sufficient number of uncleared areas of the floor.  If you use the robot every day, then in a week it will definitely go through all parts of the room.  If less often, then a model with the formation of a room map will be more suitable. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f25/ef4/2ce/f25ef42ce3172850a74414f1ea81893b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  iClebo Smart comes in color packaging.  Included is a base for charging, a battery, a cleaning brush, additional filters, two side brushes, a remote control, two microfiber cloths.  Yes, both Smart and Home can be used as a mop for cleaning floors.  Mop is installed in the compartment instead of a brush.  The minus with a mop is that it will be necessary to moisten it independently, which means that it will not be enough for many square meters. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/88r_U3J5c4k%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhikfDTZIwcKkj_aygrS2zIhRrlf7w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The presence of an LCD screen on the top cover of the vacuum cleaner helps to set the cleaning time, displays useful information about the operating mode, battery charge level, etc. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0e1/293/e71/0e1293e71556dc1a56ef22b19856df4c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A distinctive feature of the iClebo robot is a relatively low noise level, with the fact that it sucks in it is often better than the iRobot. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/JbHPyWQNMR8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhg6o9uDeoPqan4Z-LDQRdFq0m2IlA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  According to the results of tests of the Roomba 577, Roomba 530 and iClebo Smart models, it can be said with confidence that the review hero does his job better.  Smart collected not only the old carpet pile, but also any particles of dust that remained after cleaning Roomba.  Although theoretically it should have been the other way around, since Rumba has two brushes rotating in different directions. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fb2/862/740/fb2862740c7f872d1bfa580b3ede88b9.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In the test for the duration of the work, the lithium-ion battery (in many Rumbach NiMH is used, which adversely affects the battery life expectancy) held for 4 hours without recharging.  This time is enough for cleaning 3-4 rooms of medium size.  If the cleaning has not been completed, the robot will return to the base, charge and start from the same place.  Where finished cleaning, thanks to the formed map of the room. <br><br>  A minor problem with IClebo Smart (and Home) is that it has a rubber bumper made from a slightly porous rubber material.  Because of this, it can get stuck in narrow aisles.  For example, once he managed to get stuck between the leg of the coffee table and the leg of the sofa, resting a bumper between them.  He was able to get out in a couple of minutes.  It is likely that if there was a denser rim around the rubber bumper, this would not have happened. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2b0/609/bfb/2b0609bfbbcb061c51ab5024bf029c43.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Does it make sense to buy a robot vacuum cleaner?</b> <br>  Definitely is, if: 1) the budget allows (iClebo Smart costs 22 900 rubles) 2) if you have little time for cleaning 3) if you are a fan of progressive things 4) if you want to make a cool and original gift to the owner of the house. <br><br>  Yes, he will not allow you to completely forget about cleaning, but, in any case, he will keep the house clean for a long time.  Especially if you have pets.  To be honest, people are satisfied with even the simplest Chinese models, to say nothing about the advanced ones, who vacuum cleaner with higher quality and are programmed for a certain cleaning time. <br><br>  <b>Small total</b> <br>  If you decided to take a robot vacuum cleaner, but the budget is quite small, pay attention to the iRobot Roomba 440. It does not have a charging base, is not programmed for daily cleaning, has a minimum of functions, but still does its job well.  Its cost is 9950 rubles. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0ab/f1d/c84/0abf1dc8457468ddb0014a7d1437f42d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  If you have pets, pay attention to the Roomba 533 Pet, which costs 16,700. It cannot be programmed, but it has a base for automatic recharging and a more capacious battery. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7c6/825/6eb/7c68256eb49dc20dfdcb02bfc4ceb797.jpg" alt="image"><br>  If you are considering a top model, pay attention to iClebo Home or iClebo Smart worth 18,500 and 22,900 rubles, respectively. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/521/51a/ffa/52151affa6a8399785e96b5fd63c7d81.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119413/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119413/</a></p>
