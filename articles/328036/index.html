  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to use push notifications?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  From an exotic tool, push notifications have long since become an effective means of communicating with customers.  Many companies embed them in the omni-communication system.  But often, ‚Äúpushy‚Äù is reduced to sending urgent notifications, such as a message about the receipt of a new letter.  In fact, this tool can help not only to establish closer contact with the client, but actually control the behavior of the audience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/392/215/229/3922152297274a839d5a7d14e0db3e44.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Planning a campaign using push notifications is not much different from planning other marketing campaigns.  It is necessary to decide on the audience, on the text, on the time of distribution, and also on the criteria for campaign success. <br><br>  <b>Campaign planning checklist:</b> <b><br></b> <br><ul><li>  Who is the target audience? </li><li>  What text do we use? </li><li>  Mailing time? </li><li>  KPI </li></ul><br>  The most important thing to remember before launching a campaign is whether the message has value for the client.  Push-notifications - the most "persistent" notifications sent to users.  He, most likely, will notice them immediately.  Moreover, in some situations they do not allow to continue using the device until the user reads them.  It is therefore extremely important to ensure that your message will be useful and not annoying.

      Using PUSH too often can lead to a disastrous result, like the story of a boy shepherd who so often frightened villagers with wolves as a joke that when real predators appeared, no one paid any attention to his critical notifications. <br><br><h2>  Audience segmentation </h2><br>  Your clients are often a heterogeneous group of people.  Someone with you is not the first year, someone just put your application, but someone has not used it for a long time, but has not yet deleted it.  You have data on devices, there is geo-targeting, a lot of information about the user is accumulated in the application, and from any type of data you can make a filter that will send a message.  When planning a new campaign, decide on whom it will be directed to.  Then you can answer the question more precisely: what are you interested in exactly these people? <br><br>  For example, new users will by the way have a coupon with a discount on the initial purchase.  They are with you recently, and they need to be motivated for the first and second order.  More experienced clients should be asked to share their impressions of working with you, or to give some tips on how to make better use of your services, to offer related products or services to those already ordered.  To maintain their loyalty, the accumulation of points and the assignment of statuses that give discounts and preferences work well.  Those who have stopped using your offer can be reanimated by offering a discount on the services they used before. <br><br><h2>  Relevant content </h2><br>  The text of the message should be relevant, timely and useful to the client.  Failure to follow any of these three principles causes irritation and disconnection of PUSH.  For example, even a generous discount, sent on January 2, will cause annoyance to the recipient: all New Year's gifts have long been bought and handed over.  Being engaged in the text of the message, make a start from the one to whom you send it, and consider first of all the needs of the recipient. <br><br>  Analyze information about your audience, who he is, where he is now, what is the order history, think about what the person is doing at the moment, what he is doing, and formulate the most relevant text. <br><br>  It is important that the user does not just read the notification and take note, but that it convinces him to take further actions - click, go to the application and make an order or a key action.  And here, too, you can make a mistake if you force the recipient to perform too many actions.  Make it as simple as possible.  If you offer a discount coupon, it should be opened with the first click.  Do not force a person to search for it, wandering through the confusing menu. <br><br><h2>  Timeliness </h2><br>  In addition to the basic rules, such as a ban on sending messages in the middle of the night, we must also remember about timeliness.  Your users can live in different time zones, and getting, for example, coupons for a free lunch in the late afternoon, will definitely not please them.  According to statistics, the messages that were received late in the morning and at the beginning of the second half of the day are best read and perceived.  However, this is not an ‚Äúiron‚Äù rule, and some notifications may work better in the evening.  Days of the week matter too.  For example, the most effective communication will be on Wednesday and Thursday, and on Monday morning - a high level of unsubscribe from PUSH. <br><br>  Remember that, unlike emails and SMS, push notifications quickly disappear, and finding them again to re-read is very difficult.  Make sure the text is easily perceived and delivered at the right time.  As for the frequency, we do not recommend sending more than 1-3 notifications per day.  It is very important not to overload the user with information.  If he disables receiving push notifications, there is almost no chance that he will enable this feature again. <br><br><h2>  Push notifications as part of omnichannel communication </h2><br>  In omnicanal communication, push notifications have their own, very important role.  They should be used to send information, the "shelf life" of which expires very quickly.  If this is a discount offer that is valid only for the day, then it cannot be sent by mail.  The user can read the letter too late.  Use this channel to send information that is important here and now. <br><br>  Optimum work of push-notifications can be achieved by combining them on a single platform with other channels of communication, such as e-mail, SMS and voice calls.  An integrated approach to communication with the client will make this process seamless and effective. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/328036/">https://habr.com/ru/post/328036/</a></p>
