  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Vote for content and earn</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <a href="http://www.subvertandprofit.com/"><img src="http://www.techhh.com/images/snb.png" align="right"></a>  Social news services are becoming increasingly popular.  The communities on <a href="http://www.digg.com/">Digg</a> , <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/">StumbleUpon</a> (and on Runet - on sites like <a href="http://www.news2.ru/">News2</a> ) are growing every day, and the content posted by users is increasing.  Due to the model of these services - when users place external links to any materials, many of them are considered as sources of ‚Äúcommercial‚Äù traffic.  And it is quite logical that those who are interested in this kind of promotion are ready to spend some resources of their own, and, if necessary, money. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the current situation, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãorganizing a service that makes it possible to ‚Äúpump‚Äù custom-made posts by the forces of its community seems quite obvious.  At the same time, your main task is to gather people who, if necessary, are ready to vote for the necessary content and receive material remuneration for it. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.subvertandprofit.com/">Subvert and Profit</a> service just offers its customers similar services.  Instead of bothering with the time-consuming and complex process of promoting your content in communities, you can come to these guys and pay for it: S &amp; P already has 9000 loyal users who are happy to take you to the first page of popular news services. <br><br>  The business model of the project is as follows: the customer pays two dollars for one vote, one of which goes to the user who has voted.  Plus, voters receive 20% of their earnings from referrals attracted by them and 10% of the costs of attracted customers.

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
      Of course, the engines used sites are constantly evolving and adapting to all sorts of attempts to organize the publication of publications in the tops.  Now, trying to somehow counteract this, the S &amp; P asks users to vote for several neighboring posts that are not related to customized.  The service claims a probability of successful promotion to the main page - more than 60%. <br><br>  And now let's calculate.  If your material with 100 votes is on the main page of <a href="http://www.digg.com/">digg.com</a> , then you can get about 10,000 transitions.  It turns out that for every visitor you pay two cents!  Considering the fact that traffic can be even more due to an increase in the effectiveness of ads, it all looks more than attractive. <br><br>  Digg and StumbleUpon are not the only sites with which S &amp; P works.  In the near future, they also plan to launch on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> .  There is no doubt that this video hosting has a huge audience, and interest in it is fully justified.  But there are more difficulties in attracting an audience: getting a video to the main page depends on many parameters.  Therefore, it is difficult to imagine how S &amp; P will be able to make an ordinary video out of ordinary video with its cunning manipulations. <br><br>  It remains to be noted that the question of the ‚Äúvirtue‚Äù of such an idea remains open.  Forcing users to promote materials for money - apparently, is not the most positive undertaking, akin to gray methods in search engine promotion.  There is no doubt that the site will eventually try to identify custom-made materials, but it is unclear who will eventually win the fight. <br><br>  via <a href="http://www.techhh.com/">Techhh</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18417/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18417/</a></p>
