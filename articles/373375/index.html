      IX.RU (AS 8631) <br>  SFO-IX (AS 13094) <br>  FIORD-IX (AS 28917) <br>  CLOUD-IX (AS 29076) <br>  GLOBAL-IX (AS 31500) <br>  W-IX (AS 50384) <br>  DATAIX (AS 50952) <br><br>  Only I will not be comparing them according to ‚Äútotal schedules‚Äù, ‚Äúprofits‚Äù, ‚Äúinflow-outflow of subscribers‚Äù and other similar amorphous factors, as some respected publications do.  And on other, more technically interesting criteria. <br><br>  Criteria: <br><br>  availability of public looking glass + 10 balls; <br>  availability of public graphs of statistics +10 points; <br>  described in the RIPE-DB BGP community +10 points; <br>  the number of included autonomous systems +1 point for each AS; <br>  The number of unique autonomous systems included is +1 point for each AS. <br><br>  Excuse: To representatives of the IX was not so insulting, I sorted them by the number of the autonomous system (AS). <br><br><h3>  IX.RU </h3><br>  IX.RU is a group of classic intercity IXs that are not united with each other.  Legal entity of JSC "CSCC MSK-IX", specialization IX. <br><br>  The very first IX, founded within the Russian Federation, has recently become owned by Rostelecom, and it is not yet clear how much this will affect it in the future. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/992/dd7/e33/992dd7e333ac42e882c2a4742b2ae4e3.png"></div><br>  The total amount of traffic currently 2.3Tbit / c., But not entirely clear, is it statistics only MSK-IX or summary statistics of all IX groups?  Unfortunately, I did not find any general statistics on each of the traffic exchange points on the ix.ru website. <br><br>  This group includes the following urban IX: <br><br>  MSK-IX, AS8631, Moscow <br>  EKT-IX, AS43213, Ekaterinburg <br>  NSK-IX, AS42403, Novosibirsk <br>  SPB-IX, AS43690, St. Petersburg <br>  SMR-IX, AS47882, Samara <br>  RND-IX, AS48216, Rostov-on-Don <br>  VLV-IX, AS48531, Vladivostok <br>  KZN-IX, AS50706, Kazan <br><br>  Traffic is exchanged in the general peer-to-peer VLAN for each city, there is no connectivity between cities. <br><br>  On the site IX, the looking glass service is present, the RIPE-DB describes all the included operators and information on the managers of the BGP community. <br><br>  Further information on the participants of these traffic exchange points, but I immediately excluded from the review some of them.  Those - where the number of participants is less than 20: <br><br>  MSK-IX AS: 434 number present only on this IX AS: 163 <br>  EKT-IX number of AS: 45 present only on this IX AS: 7 <br>  NSK-IX AS number: 48, present only on this IX AS: 18 <br>  SPB-IX number of AS: 89 present only on this IX AS: 5 <br>  the remaining urban IX groups are insignificant (no more than 20 participants), so for now we will not consider them. <br><br><h3>  SFO-IX </h3><br>  Geographically distributed IX, owned by the Novosibirsk telecommunications operator Milecom LLC, is the main specialization of the IP transit operator, leasing communication channels. <br><br>  Famous points of presence - in the cities of Moscow, Yekaterinburg, Novosibirsk, Barnaul, Krasnoyarsk. <br><br>  There is a graph of total traffic on the site, but it does not work, for some reason there is a strange link to zabbix with ip 192.168.122.179 <br><br>  Looking glass is present, but leads to the milcom site, and the main managers of the BGP community are described in RIPE-DB. <br><br>  The number of AS 91 present only on this IX 42. <br><br><h3>  FIORD-IX </h3><br>  Geographically distributed IX belonging to the Moscow telecommunications operator CJSC STC Fiord, the main operator‚Äôs specialization is IP transit and data center services. <br><br>  Famous points of presence - in the cities of St. Petersburg, Moscow, Kharkov, Kiev. <br><br>  Unfortunately, there is no information on the total traffic inside IX on the site of this telecom operator, Fiord employees could not provide the data, there is no public looking glass service in this IX.  Also this IX is not public. <br><br>  Due to the lack of a public service, looking glass had to analyze this traffic exchange point by parsing the received routes via BGP, where the first AS in the AS-PATH attribute was taken as a participant in this IX. <br><br>  According to the data obtained, the number of AS included is at least 131, of which are present only on this IX 76. <br><br><h3>  CLOUD-IX </h3><br>  Geographically distributed IX, owned by the Moscow telecommunications operator Filanco.  The main specialization of the operator IP-transit and data center services under the brand datahouse.ru.  The IX points of presence declared on the site are in the cities of Frankfurt, Stockholm, St. Petersburg, Moscow, Yekaterinburg, Voronezh, Kiev, Kharkov. <br><br>  This IX is not a traditional point or traffic exchange network.  The technology is such that, in addition to internal connectivity, this network announces the prefixes of its members to other IXs and the global routing table.  In some cases, this leads to problems, complicates their solution and causes inconvenience in traffic management. <br><br>  This IX does not have a total load schedule. <br><br>  The looking glass service is present, and the marking and management communities are described in the RIPE-DB. <br><br>  The number of included AS 227, present only on this IX 70. <br><br><h3>  GLOBALNET-IX </h3><br>  Geographically distributed IX, owned by St. Petersburg telecommunications operator Globalnet LLC.  The main specialization of the operator is IP-transit, leasing of communication channels. <br><br>  Stated IX points of presence - in the cities of Stockholm, Helsinki, Moscow, St. Petersburg. <br><br>  IX does not have a public graph of total load, the looking glass service is present, but it does not provide sufficient information, it is somewhat cropped.  Information about the BGP community used in the RIPE-DB is also missing. <br><br>  I had to analyze and look for the participants of this IX again by the method of parsing received routes via BGP protocol from route servers IX (by analogy with Fiord). <br><br>  According to the data obtained, it turned out that the number of ASs included is at least 84, of which they are present only on this IX 16. <br><br><h3>  W-IX </h3><br>  Geographically distributed network IX, owned by the Moscow telecommunications operator LLC "IHOME".  The main operator specialization is IP-transit, data transmission channels. <br><br>  Famous points of presence - in the cities of Moscow, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, London, Paris, Kiev, Vladimir, Cheboksary, Kazan, Ufa, St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod, Tyumen, Omsk, Tomsk, Novosibirsk, Voronezh, Samara, Saratov, Permian. <br><br>  The principle is exactly the same as that of the above CLOUD-IX. <br><br>  The total amount of transit traffic currently through this IX is 1.5Tbit / s traffic. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/96f/c57/1c1/96fc571c1a454c6f8b4fca42028de4f2.png"></div><br>  On the w-ix site, it was not possible to find a public looking glass, but the labeling and managing communities are present in the RIPE-DB. <br><br>  The number of AS 172, present only on this IX 66. <br><br><h3>  DATAIX.RU </h3><br>  Geographically distributed IX, owned by Ltd. "Piring".  Operator specialization - traffic exchange network. <br><br>  Famous points of presence in the cities of Frankfurt, St. Petersburg, Moscow, Ufa, Yekaterinburg, Omsk, Novosibirsk, Khabarovsk, Belgorod, Kiev, Kharkov, Odessa. <br><br>  This network is a classic network / traffic exchange point where data is exchanged only between participants IX, without announcements of routes of participants to the 3rd party. <br><br>  The total amount of transit traffic through this IX is approximately 2.4Tbit / s, almost 1 in 1 with MSK-IX. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0c8/bc2/cb0/0c8bc2cb0f7d4fd48c961ea670513fae.png"></div><br>  This IX's looking glass is present, available at lg.dataix.ru. <br><br>  In RIPE-DB, all the included operators are described in detail, information on the marking and governing bgp community is present. <br><br>  The number of AS: 362, present only on this IX 121. <br><br><h3>  Summary table </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b60/da7/936/b60da7936cd942f9b468ef455f2baf48.png"></div><br>  Well, then the information for lovers of beautiful graphics: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/58c/ec1/794/58cec17948d3486f90f0f2e9c23f74a2.png"><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d6/517/eb8/4d6517eb89a34523b5098c5f503de340.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df4/d34/d67/df4d34d670dc45bb990e3bd6a13f00b5.png"></div><br>  From all the information gathered, the following conclusions are obtained: <br><br>  - It is necessary to make such comparisons annually and view the trend to change the connectivity of the RuNet <br>  - Feels like: not very popular traffic exchange points compete with larger ones, such as IX.ru or DataIX; <br>  - Traffic exchange points need more publicity, statistics on the site, a more detailed description of the information in the RIPE-DB, public looking-glass is mandatory. <br><br>  To which IX to connect, I will not advise, decide for yourself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373375/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373375/</a></p>
