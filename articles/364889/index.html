The standard price is 250 US dollars.  But that is not all.  If you wish to postpone the date of the exam for any reason, you will have to pay $ 50.  To obtain an additional certificate will need to prepare another $ 30.  If you decide to cancel the GMAT change (for example, due to an urgent business trip), you will receive only $ 80 as compensation.  All the above operations must be completed 7 days or more before the test date selected earlier.  Be carefull!

      <b>check in</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://gmat-test.ru/news/sdacha-gmat-kak-prokhodit-testirovanie.html">GMAT handover</a> starts with registration.  To do this, you need to visit the official website - <a href="http://www.mba.com/global/the-gmat-exam/register.aspx">mba.com</a> .  This site contains basic information about the test, the nearest dates, addresses of centers where you can pass the exam, etc.  You fill out a simple questionnaire, specify personal data and pay for the test.  Please note that you can take the exam no earlier than 3 weeks after registration. <br>  If you wish, you can sign up for testing by contacting the customer service department by phone.  Contact details are also indicated on the official website.  You can make a call three days before the desired date of the exam.  Note that in this case, the cost of the service will increase by $ 10.  People who wish to pass the GMAT, can pay for testing with a credit card. <br><br>  <b>On exam day</b> <br><br>  Testing day is the most difficult.  In addition, he is often filled with stress and feelings, and even a normal sleep on the eve of the candidates is a rarity.  But you need to understand that this day is no different from others, and the fact that your knowledge suddenly disappears somewhere from your head - only a consequence of your excitement, nothing more.  You just need to collect your thoughts and calm down.  Not bad in this helps a clear distribution of time. <br><br>  <b>1. Before the test</b> <br><br>  Last preparation at the door is a bad idea.  It is better to arrive early, at least half an hour before the test.  This time is enough to collect thoughts, build material in your mind and realize that passing the GMAT is just a test, not worse than any school.  If you come straight to the very beginning, you will not have time to collect your thoughts. <br><br>  <b>2. 10 minutes before the start</b> <br><br>  As soon as you sign up, you will be handed a lock key with your belongings.  But this rule does not apply in all centers.  Some simply do not allow things to be carried with them. <br><br>  <b>3. First steps for the audience</b> <br><br>  Audience testing - a place in which video surveillance is constantly conducted.  But do not be afraid.  You will forget about this as soon as the test itself begins.  The most important thing is that it‚Äôs impossible to seek help from a neighbor, and you will be completely immersed in yourself and in the knowledge that you have accumulated during the preparation for the test. <br><br>  <b>4. Last Moments</b> <br><br>  Seconds before the start, you will be given a draft, a pen, and a notebook.  In some classrooms, headphones are also provided for complete sound insulation from the surrounding space.  This is very good, because the GMAT surrender is a knock on the keys of multiple keyboards, making it difficult to focus on questions and answers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d3/e5f/9cb/5d3e5f9cb8b04580b7b1b2e9eabe98bc.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>5. Start</b> <br><br>  So, you are logged in.  Usually at this stage there are no problems.  It is unpleasant that a 30-minute timer report starts in the corner of the screen.  So much time you will be given on the first part of the test - an essay.  It is not necessary now and then to translate a glance at this watch, but to sit idle, even if it seems to you that you have time for everything, is not worth it either. <br><br>  <b>6. First hour</b> <br><br>  After the essay, you will be given another 30 minutes to complete the tasks in the Integrated Reasoning section. <br><br>  <b>7. 8 minute break</b> <br><br>  Clicking on the OK button will give you the right to leave the audience for 8 minutes.  But this time you do not have enough to relax.  Yes, and thoughts about future mathematical tasks will strain.  Gather strength and have patience. <br><br>  <b>8. The most intense moment: 68-143 minutes of the test</b> <br><br>  These 75 minutes are the mathematical part of the test.  It‚Äôs not that GMAT surrender is a test of strength, because it‚Äôs just a test of your knowledge.  But the system sometimes deliberately checks those tested for psychological stability.  It is important to pull yourself together and mark solved tasks in a notebook, thereby saving precious minutes of time. <br><br>  <b>9. Break number 2</b> <br><br>  Rest again, and again - a measly 8 minutes.  Use them wisely.  Take a deep breath and relax.  Switch the brain from the mathematical part of the verbal. <br><br>  <b>10. The remaining 75 minutes to go</b> <br><br>  At this point, the test takes almost 4 hours to complete.  Of course, fatigue will be very big.  But do not relax.  This you can do when the test is finally completed, but for now concentrate and gather your will and the remnants of patience.  This is the final step.  Think about it. <br><br>  <b>11. The last 8 minutes of doing nothing.</b> <br><br>  At the end of the test, there will be an exciting pause, which lasts just like all breaks, 8 minutes.  What to do at this moment?  You can finally completely relax.  You can dream about future studies.  Introduce yourself as a student.  Feel the taste of student everyday life, which, of course, is already waiting for you and it remains just a little bit to make sure of this.  In general, this is the very moment when you need to completely abstract and not worry about anything. <br><br>  <b>12. Result and selection</b> <br><br>  As soon as you know your test result, you will have exactly 2 minutes to make a decision - agree with him and leave this <a href="http://gmat-test.ru/balli-gmat.html">assessment</a> , or refuse. <br><br>  We hope that our advice will be useful for you and passing the test will be successful.  Good luck on the exam! <br><br>  <i>In the <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/tests/gmat-i-gre-skhodstva-i-razlichiya/">next post</a> we will compare GMAT with its closest competitor - the GRE test.</i>  <i>The article will be very useful to those who are still at a crossroads and have not decided which exam to pass.</i> <br><br>  The author of the article is Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364889/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364889/</a></p>
