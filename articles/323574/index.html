For the last ten years I have been designing, so I could always make a logo for my projects myself.  How can you make a cool logo if you are not a designer? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e7/bd8/e86/7e7bd8e86b9c4adb856586c388793c79.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Most turn to a nephew of a distant relative, who seems to be able to use Photoshop or just draws well.  But I advise you to take this question into your own hands, and, let this be your first and, possibly, the last logo, it will be on a par with Sony and Facebook!  You will proudly put it on the site, and no one on the Internet will guess that you are not a designer <s>cat</s> . <br><br>  Here are two simple rules that I came up with.  They will help you make your own logo in a million:

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      1. Start your journey to success with a <b>font logo</b> <br>  2. Focus on the <b>corporate style</b> , especially the combination of colors <br><br>  Let's go in order.  What is a font logo?  This means that only the font part is used in the logo, without a logo or symbol.  Like Google: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e0/972/d78/6e0972d7832d411f856e65488d0c608e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Why the font logo?  What about the badge?  Somehow not rich looks, I do not laugh?  Maybe add some squiggle? <br><br>  Do not panic!  Using a font logo is like putting on a shirt and jacket for a business meeting.  You can, of course, try to choose a sweater for jeans or come in polo and moccasins, but you need to have impeccable taste, otherwise you will look like a clown.  It is the same with the logo - if there is no professional identity designer at hand, it is better not to try to jump higher than your head.  Just look at these really serious guys - they all use logos based on the same font, Helvetica: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/024/c10/77b/024c1077b3cc430fb86b53d2ca374309.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Maybe this can afford only large companies that already know everything?  I do not think so - in my opinion, in the logo, the main high-quality graphics and the overall impression.  For example, Jeep and Lufthansa have emblems, but the font version of the logo looks solid.  I sincerely believe in it and used this approach myself at the start of my project.  We started with such a logo and it didn‚Äôt prevent us from receiving the first orders: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f61/e8d/0a1/f61e8d0a11364a5aae2ca285fe016832.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  How to choose a suitable font?  You can go to <a href="http://wordmark.it/">wordmark.it</a> and write in the field the name of your project - the site will show it with all the fonts that are on the computer.  If this is not enough, there are many free headsets on <a href="http://www.fontfabric.com/category/free/">fontfabric.com</a> , including those with Cyrillic support.  What's wrong with free fonts?  Nothing, use on health. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aaf/7bf/2e4/aaf7bf2e46444f6cbc7a68e7375877c9.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Which font is better to choose?  Here I also advise you to adhere to the rule ‚Äúmodesty adorns‚Äù.  Look at all the options and try to feel which one best conveys the spirit and style of your project.  Do not look in the direction of unusual incidental fonts - they stand out from the rest, but most often they look inappropriate, like feathers from a carnival in Rio on a morning jog. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc7/774/571/bc7774571cb944a2b1bd71e93c5b9d3a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Avoid the temptation to write a project name CAPITAL.  At first glance, such a spelling looks neater lowercase, like a steady rectangle.  But in fact, capital letters are perceived worse.  If you still want to use only capital, increase the letter spacing - this will increase the readability of your logo, especially in a small format. <br><br>  The second important point for the design of any project, I called the <b>corporate identity</b> .  What it is and how it will help your project become visible and recognizable, I will tell you next time.  I can only say - the logo is not the main thing, and in itself it will give little.  Whatever the marketers say, the formulas for a successful logo, which by its very appearance will lead a crowd of customers, have not yet been invented. <br><br>  I have described a simple approach that will help make a solid and neat logo and avoid the vulgarity.  Of course, to make a quality font logo, you also need a designer, but at the start of the project, you can do without it - then you can play with fonts, and come up with an emblem.  And if it seems to you that the font logo is somehow not rich and the boys from the district will not understand, look at the Accenture company logo, which invests millions of dollars in its corporate identity: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/780/66a/c1c/78066ac1cac547b386fbe4755a1957e8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Have a good design for your projects and do not forget to subscribe to the Log machine - there are a lot of interesting things ahead! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/323574/">https://habr.com/ru/post/323574/</a></p>
