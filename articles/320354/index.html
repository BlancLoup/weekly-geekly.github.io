Jobs.tut.by sought out several families, which, despite the youth of the Belarusian IT industry, can already be called dynasties of programmers. <br><br>  <b>How it all began: punch cards and lack of prestige</b>

      ‚ÄúI entered the faculty of applied mathematics and computer science at a time when the work of a programmer was not prestigious.  Friends felt sorry for me: why did you, smart guy, go there?  Here is a lawyer, a merchandiser - good specialties - says Sergey Miyusov, an EPAM engineer.  - We wrote the code on the blanks, the women transferred it to punch cards, and we already ‚Äúfed‚Äù punch cards to a huge computer.  I am from the generation when the computers were large and the code is small. ‚Äù <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Sergey's father worked all his life at the car-repair plant, his elder brother also worked there for several years, but he himself was a teacher of mathematics, a favorite school subject, persuaded to enter the department.  Again, everything could have turned out differently: he did not pass through the competition, also went to the plant - true, already "much closer to IT" - to "Electronics" at the Integral, worked there before the army.  ‚ÄúI decided in the army: I want to enter the faculty of applied mathematics.  They taught in a wide profile: you and a mathematician, you and a programmer, ‚Äùrecalls Sergey Miyusov. <br><br>  His son Alexey, who works in the same company with his father, had already had an example on the project related to artificial intelligence, when choosing a profession: ‚ÄúThe father influenced in any case.  I went to work for him, it was very interesting.  This is a promising direction - plus, I won‚Äôt be bored anyway. ‚Äù <br><br>  The new generation of IT professionals sees the prospects of this industry - both professional and financial.  Their fathers, who came to the sphere that was just emerging, were much harder to see. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhen I came to IT, programmers were somewhere at the janitor‚Äôs wage level, and the‚Äú advanced ‚Äùyouth stood in line at promising lawyers and economists,‚Äù recalls the representative of another dynasty working in EPAM, Alexey Bredikhin. <br><br>  The son of a military man, who graduated from the BSU faculty of applied mathematics and computer science in the 90s, no longer found computers on punched cards: ‚ÄúBefore me, women mostly studied at the faculty, but I came to a turning point when more guys came to him.  Computers have become more accessible, mechanical work has moved into the creative. " <br>  Alexey, who supervises several international projects, brought his son Yura to the children's holidays at EPAM, and just got to work, sat down beside him, and from early childhood he was inspired by his father's work.  Abilities to mathematics in their family "are inherited," and after graduating from math gymnasium, the guy entered the same department as his father graduated from. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe university gave knowledge more slowly than I would like.  And I understood that in order to grow, you need to work somewhere, to gain practical knowledge.  EPAM, in which the father worked, allows students, even without work experience, to pump and try themselves on real projects.  If you have the knowledge and desires, ‚Äúthe doors are open,‚Äù says Yuri, who works with Big Data. <br><br>  <b>Not broken by the nineties</b> <br><br>  In IBA, we found, perhaps, the largest family of programmers: the company has two brothers, the wife of one of them and two daughters. <br><br>  The elder Vladimir and the younger Vasily came to the company from the Research Institute of Computer, whose team once became the backbone of the IBA.  Before their eyes was an example of colleagues, many of whom left the institute in the early 90s, but the Bartosz family acted differently. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt was very difficult.  The work was aimed at the Allied projects, and when the USSR collapsed, it was almost gone.  Many acquaintances are gone, mainly in trade.  We were sorry to give up our profession, ‚Äùrecalls Vasily.  The Time of Troubles ended relatively quickly, the IBA company arose, the first overseas orders went.  Vladimir, in particular, was lucky to solve such interesting problems as ‚ÄúProblem 2000‚Äù and transferring software to the euro, when Europe switched to a common currency. <br><br>  By the way, the dynasty did not even begin with the brothers: their mother was a teacher of mathematics, and later, computer science, when this subject became compulsory at school.  The first acquaintance of the brothers with computer science took place according to the book found in her mother's library.  It talked about the methods of teaching mathematics: ‚ÄúThere was a slide rule, calculators, and at the end of the book - what is most interesting - was an American translation of an article about the basics of programming.  And even there were examples of programs in some language, maybe BASIC, I don‚Äôt remember, ‚Äùsays Vladimir.  - It was not clear, but very interesting.  The author wrote that this was the future - and the American turned out to be right. ‚Äù <br><br>  Bartosh brothers received vocational education at the Belarusian State University at the Faculty of Mechanics and Technology.  The wife of Vladimir Zoya also studied there: ‚ÄúProgramming was taught in those years, but not much.  We managed to learn a little more about him, when in the second year of almost the whole group we chose the department of numerical methods and programming, real knowledge, experience and understanding were obtained directly at work. ‚Äù <br><br>  The next generation of the family, sisters Natalia and Tatiana (daughters Vladimir and Zoya), both graduated from the gymnasium with a gold medal, following the example of their parents and uncle, also chose the BSU faculty, and for work - IBA.  Natalia, a system programmer, says: ‚ÄúNone of the adults insisted on choosing a profession, but school computer science and the work of parents and uncles inspired to become a programmer.  And I do not regret it at all. ‚Äù <br><br>  Tatyana had thoughts of becoming a math teacher like her grandmother.  As a child, her parents took her and her sister to work several times: ‚ÄúAt that time, it was not quite clear to me what people were doing behind monitors.  She only knew that they were ‚Äúprogramming‚Äù.  In general, it was always interesting for me to deal with a computer, digital technology, connect, configure something, understand how it works.  In school years, I independently studied the creation of animation and work in graphic editors.  There have always been fresh issues of computer newspapers and magazines at home. ‚Äù <br><br>  Tatiana participated in mathematics and programming competitions, and then entered the BSU at the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics.  On the new specialty "Web programming and Internet technology."  Tatiana jokes about the choice of the company for work: ‚ÄúEither the memory of the annual New Year sweets from IBA, or simply the credibility of the company worked.‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúWorking as a programmer is always an endless study of something new and development.  In my opinion, it is impossible not to love, ‚ÄùTatiana believes.  Not only the sister, but also the older generation, who came to IT even when the computers were huge, the code is short, and the prospects are very vague, agrees with her. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/320354/">https://habr.com/ru/post/320354/</a></p>
