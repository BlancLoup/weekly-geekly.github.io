The main problem was that OpenVPN had to be forced to work on top of unstable PPPoE simultaneously letting all traffic through OpenVPN <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The initial goal was to save money on Internet traffic in the branches because  in remote areas, the price of unlimited ADSL with a width of 256kb / s cost about 7-10t.r.  per month, and the internet was vital. <br>  All the joy was that almost all branches had connections from one provider, in which the concept of local and peering traffic existed, and the main office had a dedicated broad Internet (another provider, but by chance he was loyal to the branch provider and he had peer-to-peer traffic "with a price of about 6 kopecks per megabyte). <br><img src="http://my.jetscreenshot.com/2356/20100805-l38n-40kb.jpg" alt="image">

    <h4>  1. proxy </h4><br>  The quickest solution was the usual cascade of proxy servers, and this was done because  before all the branches distributed the Internet in their direct modem, then everyone had to select 1 system administrator, who would act as a gateway, the system managers were not gifts, who would give the 800th stump, someone 233, in general, who had that ... Although today it‚Äôs 4 7 tr.  You can build a decent gateway, but the owner is a master, I want to speak at no cost! <br><br>  On these gateways ubuntu 8.04 LTS was installed configured as a gateway, so that it plugged into the local network, into the modem and into the outlet, and everything worked right away.  in many branches, admins could only click "Any key" on the user's keyboard, but it does not matter, it went, gradually 7 branches reconfigured their modems, and stuck gateways :) <br><br>  Immediately raised the proxy cascade, sent http traffic there, but as we all know, HTTP traffic is just a certain% of the total traffic, switching to simpler tariffs, there was a saving, but conditional, because the negligent admin or user could for example pull through a torrent something weighty, which promised money for the affiliate ... <br><br>  Along the way, other tasks appeared in the central office - transfer of a comparative postman, gateway, portal set up in 2002 and untouched since then, but this deserves a separate article ... <br>  And while we are just interested in the network ... <br><br><h4>  2. OpenVPN </h4><br>  I saw this thing for the first time, there was a certain fear before the first acquaintance, then reading manuals and Internet, I rolled up my sleeves and put it on :) <br><br>  2.1 Server <br>  has 2 eth1 network adapters (192.168.5.x) - Local network and eth0 (real ip 111.111.111.111) Internet with a wide channel. <br><br> <code>apt-get install openvpn</code> <br> <br>  Next, create a server configuration file <br> <code>touch /etc/openvpn/server.conf</code> <br> <br>  <em>when the system is booted, all VPN connections for which in the / etc / openvpn folder there are corresponding files with the .conf extension are automatically raised</em> <br><br>  I got it like this. <br><br> <code>port 1194 # <br> proto udp # <br> dev tun #   <br> ca /etc/openvpn/ca.crt <br> cert /etc/openvpn/server.crt <br> key /etc/openvpn/server.key # This file should be kept secret <br> dh /etc/openvpn/dh1024.pem <br> server 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0 # vpn subnet <br> ifconfig-pool-persist ipp.txt #    ip   <br> push "route 192.168.5.0 255.255.255.0" # home <br> keepalive 10 120 <br> comp-lzo <br> user nobody <br> group nogroup <br> persist-key <br> persist-tun <br> status openvpn-status.log <br> log-append openvpn.log <br> verb 4 <br> mute 20 <br> client-to-client <br> client-config-dir /etc/openvpn/ccd #       <br> route 192.168.0.0 255.255.255.0 #      1 <br> route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 #      2 <br></code> <br><br>  Create a directory in which individual client settings will be stored: <br><br> <code>mkdir /etc/openvpn/ccd</code> <br> <br>  Now you need to create keys and certificates for encryption and authorization. <br><br> <code>cd /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/easy-rsa/2.0 <br> source ./vars <br> ./clean-all <br> ./build-ca</code> <br> <br>  Now we will create a certificate and private key for the server: <br><br> <code>./build-key-server server</code> <br> <br>  Create a key for the client (if there are several clients, the procedure will have to be repeated): <br><br> <code>./build-key client1</code> <br> <br>  <em>for each client must be specified a unique name (in this case client1).</em> <br><br>  <em>if a new client is created after some time, the procedure will be as follows:</em> <br><br> <code>cd /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/easy-rsa/2.0 <br> source ./vars <br> ./build-key client2 <br></code> <br><br>  Generating Diffie-Hellman parameters: <br><br> <code>./build-dh</code> <br> <br>  Place the following files in the / etc / openvpn / directory <br><br> <code>* ca.crt <br> * server.crt <br> * dh1024.pem <br> * server.key</code> <br> <br>  Create the file /etc/openvpn/ipp.txt <br><br>  The configuration file of the client machine /etc/openvpn/client.conf was like this <br><br> <code>remote 111.111.111.111 1194 <br> client <br> dev tun <br> proto udp <br> resolv-retry infinite # this is necessary for DynDNS <br> nobind <br> user nobody <br> group nogroup <br> persist-key <br> persist-tun <br> ca /etc/openvpn/ca.crt <br> cert /etc/openvpn/client1.crt <br> key /etc/openvpn/client1.key <br> comp-lzo <br> verb 4 <br> mute 20 <br> redirect-gateway <br> #show-net-up <br> verb 4</code> <br> <br>  Now you need to copy the generated client keys and the authoritative server certificate from the server to the / etc / openvpn / folder: <br> <code>* ca.crt <br> * client1.crt <br> * client1.key</code> <br> <br>  If there is a 192.168.1.x network behind the client, in order for the server to see it, you need to add a route to it to the server. <br><br>  On the server, create the file / etc / openvpn / ccd / client1 with the following content: <br><br> <code>iroute 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 <br> #    2,  2     <br> #push "route 192.168.100.0 255.255.255.0" <br> #    OpenVPN <br> push "redirect-gateway def1" <br></code> <br>  This is where the most evil problem happened to me. <br><br>  OpenVPN receiving directive <br> <code>push "redirect-gateway def1"</code> <br>  <em>(if there is a 'pull' in its configuration), the client does not delete the old route, but adds the following entries to the routing table:</em> <br> <code>0.0.0.0/1 via 192.168.231.5 dev tun0 <br> 128.0.0.0/1 via 192.168.231.5 dev tun0</code> <br>  and if openvpn goes via ethernet, then everything works and pleases the admin and users, but the great ppp likes to take this route. <br> <code>0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 U 0 0 0 ppp0</code> <br> <br>  And OpenVPN swears something like this <br> <code>Jul 2 19:28:53 ino ovpn-client[14465]: NOTE: unable to redirect default gateway -- Cannot read current default gateway from system</code> <br> <br>  The solution to this problem has been long and tedious, although it is on the surface.  if this gateway ppp route indicates the gateway instead of 0.0.0.0 the real gateway, then OpenVPN sees this route and adds its own without any problems. <br><br>  Therefore, I created a file <br> <code>/etc/ppp/ip-up.d/routing</code> <br>  In which I wrote a small script.  (I ask you not to kick with your feet, I am very lazy, and did not write a full-fledged script for defining a gateway and editing routes, but I made it as a simple crutch) <br>  <i>I would be very happy if someone offers a more logical, reliable, and universal method of editing routes on the fly.</i> <br>  So far, there is no certainty that everything will work 100% with ppp cliffs, but life will show, if that happens, I will correct the topic. <br><br> <code>#! /bin/sh <br> #             222... <br> gw1=`ip route show | grep 222 | awk '{print $1}'` <br> #  0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 <br> route del default <br> #      <br> route add -net default gw ${gw1} dev ppp0</code> <br> <br>  Making it executable <br> <code>chmod ug+x /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/routing</code> <br> <br>  After that, the reboot, after some time the server stopped pinging on the external ipu, but began to respond on the inside - 10.10.10.26 <br><br>  Threat Please take into account that the firewall of the gateway and the server and the client must be corrected in order for the users to have a vital Internet. <br>  For example, I did it like this: <br> <code>-A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0 -j MASQUERADE</code> <br>  There is no binding to either the external interface or ip :) <br>  when, for various reasons, we don‚Äôt have openvpn, then users will have a direct Internet, and when it appears, all traffic will fly through it. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br><br>  In life, this system is assembled in stages, first the server starts and the client starts, ping each other at 10.10.10.x, then routes are added to the networks that are behind the server and the client, they are checked when everything is stable and reliably we add the directive <br> <code>push "redirect-gateway def1"</code> <br>  And again we are working and living, everything was done without leaving the office, on the gateways of the branches, network interfaces were signed, so that the administrator just plugged in the network cables and power, called me, and then I set up ssh on the working mode. <br><br><h4>  Oh yeah, I almost forgot, the most important thing is profit </h4><br>  In addition to the fact that now the whole network addresses the servers and services of the branches and the center by internal ip addresses, so also financial savings. <br><br>  Previously, each branch spent an average of 7,000 rubles on the Internet.  per month, now per month, each of them pays 550r.  for access to the peering, the Internet is not consumed (except for the central one), for the beginning 7 branches were launched, then there will be more. <br>  it turns out that for the year with the old scheme the company would spend <b>588 000 rub.</b> on the Internet <b>.</b>  , and with the current scheme, <b>46 200 rubles</b> will be spent per year <b>.</b> <br><br><h4>  What's next? </h4><br>  And now, on this whole <s>heh ... we will try to fly!</s>  I will try to deploy IP Telephony in order to minimize the cost of long-distance telephone calls between branches, to connect softATS with hardware in branches, which I will definitely write about.  Good luck <br><br>  <b>update1</b> Many questions have arisen to the term ‚ÄúLarge company‚Äù I will try to clarify. <br><br>  It is large in Siberia, the center has a staff of 200 employees, branches from 20 to 60, 10-20 objects are still attached to each branch.  5-15 people.  branches less than 30. <br><br>  The company is not very agile, the main control comes from the state, the equipment, the company makes some steps towards IT development :) <br><br>  <b>Update2</b> <br>  And so, after testing, it turned out that if the control server was permanently lowered for a long time, then clients would not willingly raise openvpn and traffic could go straight to the expensive Internet. <br>  Also, if the ADSL channel is forcibly broken, then it seems to be openvpn and it tries to start again, but it does not work for him, and he goes around in a circle. <br>  I tried all sorts of options and keepalive and ping-restart and so on ... did not help ... <br><br>  Therefore, we write a small script that will check the state of affairs. <br> <code>touch /usr/bin/vpn_keepalive.sh</code> <br> <br>  C content. <br><br> <code>#! /bin/sh <br> #    ,    <br> #debug_out=/dev/null <br> debug_out=/dev/stdout <br> #NEXTHOP      <br> #     OpenVPN  <br> NEXTHOP=192.168.5.1 <br> #    <br> OPEN_VPN_CMD="sudo /etc/init.d/openvpn restart" <br> PING=/bin/ping <br> <br> logger_opts="-t $0" <br> if [ "$debug_out" = "/dev/stdout" ] <br> then <br> logger_opts="$logger_opts -s" <br> fi <br> pckts_rcvd=`$PING -c 8 -q -W 2 $NEXTHOP | grep transm | awk '{print $4}'` <br> echo "host: $NEXTHOP, pckts_rcvd: $pckts_rcvd" &gt;$debug_out <br> if [ $pckts_rcvd -eq 0 ] <br> then <br> echo "Connection with $NEXTHOP lost, resetting" | logger $logopts <br> $OPEN_VPN_CMD &gt; $debug_out <br> else <br> echo "Connection with $NEXTHOP up, no action" | logger $logopts <br> fi <br></code> <br>  Making it executable <br> <code>chmod ug+x /usr/bin/vpn_keepalive.sh</code> <br> <br>  The script pings the host, and if 0 packets are returned, it will execute the restart command. <br>  after that, everything is guaranteed to rise, the correct routes are flowing in, and the traffic goes through VPN traffic <br><br>  We throw this script in kroner <br> <code>crontab -e</code> <br> <br>  for example, every 2 minutes. <br> <code>0-59/2 * * * * /usr/bin/vpn_keepalive.sh</code> <br> <br>  And all if debug is enabled, then in the logs (syslog) it will be noted like this. <br> <code>logger: Connection with 192.168.5.1 up, no action</code> <br> <br>  Good luck! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/100932/">https://habr.com/ru/post/100932/</a></p>
