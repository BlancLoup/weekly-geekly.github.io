Notice, not yet for a ruble!  The ruble will be at the expiration of the offer, i.e.  September 15th.  This is NOT Tinkoff People &amp; Tinkoff Bank offers, they don‚Äôt need this, I will buy it for the children, let them have fun and give out the cards at school and college.  Roma CEO will appoint, he likes to cross and all the time I have to prove something.  Let the service station be his, he likes to play on the computer constantly and troll classmates.  If there are 2000 likes, we'll take it! ‚ÄùTinkov wrote on his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php%3Ffbid%3D1108276725866516%26set%3Da.210650872295777.59972.100000525969697%26type%3D1%26theater">Facebook</a> page. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Oleg Tinkov has a special relationship with Roketbank.  One of the founders of Roketbank, waylaid Tinkov on the street and asked what he thought of the new service.  Tinkov replied that the application is beautiful, but there is no bank.  Then a comment with a photo of Tinkov came online.  The negative reaction of the entrepreneur was used for public relations of a competitor.  Rocketbank competes with <a href="https://www.tinkoff.ru/">Tinkoff Bank</a> in the field of online banking.

      Rockettbank does not have a license.  He works on the basis of <a href="http://intercommerz.ru/">Interkommerts</a> Bank, which issues and services his cards. <br><br>  The target audience of the application is young people aged 25‚Äì35 years.  The bank was established by Oleg Kozyrev, Viktor Lysenko, Alexey Kolesnikov and Mikhail Provision.  The Rocketbank project was initially developed with the money of the founders themselves, later they attracted funds from the <a href="http://www.runacap.com/">Runa Capital fund</a> and the <a href="http://life-sreda.ru/">Life.Sreda</a> fund.  Runa Capital invested $ 2-3 million in exchange for a 20-30% stake in the Rocketbank project. <br><br>  Roketbank co-founder Alexei Kolesnikov regarded Tinkoff's offer as a farce or a prelude to a conversation.  ‚ÄúWe are always ready to discuss business proposals.  But a million is at best for warming up.  If Tinkov offers 20-25 times more, then we can seriously discuss it, ‚Äùhe said. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe development of such an application is worth about $ 1 million.  Rocket Bank is a shell that is tied to bank services.  It is impossible to simply take and transplant it to another credit institution.  And legally, clients belong to Interkommerts Bank, and they cannot simply be taken and transferred automatically to another bank.  We need to renegotiate with people, send couriers.  Roketbank does not have its own reporting, but there are no huge changes in the balance sheets of Interkommerts during the time that the application works, ‚ÄùGerman Klimenko, chairman of the board of the Internet Development Institute, <a href="http://top.rbc.ru/finances/09/09/2015/55f00eaf9a79474bd1720702">shared his</a> thoughts with RBC. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn our opinion from the inside, the potential of its development is far from being exhausted,‚Äù says Denis Khrenov, senior vice president of Interkommerts Bank. <br><br>  Roketbank co-founder, Oleg Kozyrev, denied that the project was looking for buyers, but noted: ‚ÄúIf Oleg Yuryevich wants to get to know us all, our office is always open.  If he also wants to offer something, then there is no problem to talk on this topic. ‚Äù <br><br>  PS <br><br>  ‚ÄúIf the guys from Rocketbank have a good offer to buy, I would sell (this is just my opinion as an investor) and take profits (I don‚Äôt believe in unicorn in Russia in the medium term).  And Oleg always throws mud at something that he cannot get himself, ‚Äùsays Life.Sreda Fund Managing Partner Vladislav Solodky. <br><br><img src="https://fbcdn-photos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfa1/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/11752355_700369670107690_7194831641591148044_n.jpg?oh=6b324ea4fb55962c79648ae803b1b0c6&amp;oe=566358E1&amp;__gda__=1454022195_f4017eb629243d3f3a1283ccf516addd" alt="image" width="300"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294378/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294378/</a></p>
