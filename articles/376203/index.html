Awareness of the unity of these two elements will lead to the fact that the original solutions from this manufacturer will no longer be surprised.  For example, to offer a technology that will allow you to feel the sound, literally.  Under the cut a set of emotions and letters about the headset Mad Catz FREQ 4D. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5a7/40e/a90/5a740ea9079949388c9d0214f5dc88fa.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      The traditional meeting on clothes will be joyful, the box makes a positive impression, it is immediately obvious that designers do not eat their bread for nothing.  Original bevels give charm to the package and give hope for the ‚Äúcontinuation of the banquet‚Äù inside. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4fb/b63/0a0/4fbb630a021a4fd99c08977d687ecefb.jpg"><br><br>  The right side of the box is completely transparent.  A small plastic insert provides a view of one of the headphones and a piece of headband. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/76e/bf1/8ac/76ebf18ac0c74ec3a68bf3b661b182d9.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Contents of delivery: </h3><br>  Inside the box are: <br><ul><li>  headset </li><li>  USB cable </li><li>  3.5 mm cable </li><li>  manual </li><li>  warranty information and a few flyers </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/64e/35c/ccb/64e35cccbd684ce3a38cc2c18ebfdf6c.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="http://store.madcatz.com/platforms/pc/Mad-Catz-F-R-E-Q-4D-Stereo-Gaming-Headset-for-PC-Mac-and-Smart-Devices-Black.html">The manufacturer's website</a> tells us about the following characteristics: <br><ul><li>  cable length: 2 m (USB), 1 m (mini-jack 3.5 mm); </li><li>  speaker diameter: 50 mm; </li><li>  Neodymium magnets; </li><li>  frequency range: 20 Hz - 20 kHz; </li><li>  harmonic distortion (Total Harmonic Distortion, THD): &lt;1%; </li><li>  signal-to-noise ratio (Signal-to-Noise Ratio, SNR): 60 dB / V; </li><li>  resistance: 32 Ohm; </li><li>  built-in microphone; </li><li>  power supply: USB; </li><li>  compatibility with mobile devices </li></ul><br><br>  The most wonderful thing in this headset is ViviTouch technology - according to the world wide web, it was developed by Bayer (the inventors of aspirin, polyurethane, polycarbonate, Levitra and ... heroin).  What was done: thin polymer films invented by the Germans simulate muscle movements under the action of electrical impulses.  In fact, this leads to the fact that any low-frequency sound is transmitted to the skin of your ears.  I do not know how anyone, but I liked it, was even a little ticklish. <br><br><h3>  Appearance </h3><br>  Designers Mad Catz did not become original and continued to use the futuristic style, which has already brought success to previous products of the company.  The combination of matte and glossy plastic looks impressive, until you started using the headset and didn‚Äôt grab it with your fingers (especially for those who like to chew on chips or similar things).  Marcost simply prohibitive, but perhaps this is the only complaint to the materials. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5a7/40e/a90/5a740ea9079949388c9d0214f5dc88fa.jpg"><br><br>  The unusual shape of the ears does not cause inconvenience in use, ear cushions made from high-quality imitation leather fit snugly and do not press. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a04/7bf/e82/a047bfe82066468d8129b0c5f1fc0aa7.jpg"><br><br>  You can adjust the length of the headband with almost medical precision, on a special scale with millimetric notches applied.  My head was not the smallest without any problems, and not on the most extended inserts.  On the contrary, the minimum length of the headband is large enough and teenagers are likely to be uncomfortable to wear Mad Catz FREQ 4D <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da3/3b5/02f/da33b502f5104202bd328cb9a2a495cb.jpg"><br><br>  The insulation is made at a very high level, while listening to the energetic immortal Nirvana album ‚ÄúIn Utero‚Äù at a medium level, the people around you heard only that some music was playing in the headphones, but quietly and without interfering with the household. <br><br>  Control buttons placed on the bowl of headphones.  On the right are the microphone and the on / off button, as well as the volume control, made in the form of a cylinder.  The adjustment, by the way, is very accurate.  that is, until you unscrew the sound to the maximum, your finger will have to work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac1/f67/b13/ac1f67b134854226a437dc8ed52a86b1.jpg"><br><br>  On the left, the ViviTouch 4D mode switch and the built-in equalizer switch are available (modes: Games, Music, Voice are available) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e3/72d/f2f/6e372df2f8974942adcb0c2041d0750c.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Connecting and using the device </h3><br>  Either of the two cables offered in the kit is connected to the headset itself via the microUSB connector.  At the opposite end, you can choose either a USB connection or a classic 3.5 mm jack. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1d4/3df/358/1d43df3586d442b9bfd3d54d964df9f6.jpg"><br><br>  When connected via USB, Mad Catz FREQ 4D is defined in the controller according to its own name.  Drivers are not required, because the built-in audio codec is activated, additional software is simply not provided.  Any modes of the headset are implemented in hardware.  In addition, the ‚Äúvibrator‚Äù only works when connected via USB. <br>  When connecting via a normal jack, you need to consider that the wiring is intended primarily for laptops, mobile phones and tablets.  On the wire there is a button for receiving / rejecting a call and a mechanical volume control.  The built-in equalizer with this connection option does not work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f8/3ee/518/1f83ee518d6d490fb3f8c3204f1df5a7.jpg"><br><br>  Headset sound worthy for its category.  You have to understand that this is not a Sennheiser HD-650 or something like that, for notorious music lovers, Mad Catz has not prepared anything supernatural. <br><br>  The three sound modes are different and really correspond to the names, it was most pleasant to my warm tube ear to listen to music (the aforementioned Nirvana group) in the Music mode, and in games with ViviTouch 4D turned on, the low frequencies were felt best.  I would not use Mad Catz FREQ 4D in modes that do not correspond to the scenarios if playing music in game mode would be an obvious search for low frequencies, but rather too many high frequencies. <br><br>  In general, the headset is very good, there are small blots and features.  In addition to brand plastic, this is not the most ideal job when working in headset mode with a mobile phone outdoors.  But here I will say that this is not the most targeted use of the device, and therefore I will not blame for it. <br><br>  I will bring together for those who like to read only the conclusions of their thoughts: <br><h4>  Pros and benefits </h4><br><ul><li>  High build quality </li><li>  ViviTouch technology </li><li>  No need to put extra software to reveal all the functions of the headset </li><li>  The possibility of using both a computer and a mobile phone or tablet </li><li>  Space original design </li></ul><br><h4>  Cons and features </h4><br><ul><li>  Brand plastic headband and, consequently, not the most neat appearance in the process of using </li><li>  Imperfect microphone operation outdoors </li></ul><br><br>  The headset is traded in Russia from 8,500 to 9,600 rubles, but a branded headset in the Titanfall style can be purchased for 7,000 rubles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/376203/">https://habr.com/ru/post/376203/</a></p>
