      <b>Current place of work:</b> <br>  Socialist Group, Business Development Director. <br><br>  <b>One word that best describes how you work:</b> <br>  It is infectious. <br><br>  <b>How many hours a day do you work?</b> <br>  Depends on many factors.  Usually 10-12 hours, but I never stop thinking even at night. <br><br>  <b>Current mobile device:</b> <br>  iPhone 6. <br><br>  <b>Current computer:</b> <br>  Macbook Air. <br><br>  <b>Without any applications, programs, utilities you can not live?</b> <br>  Facebook, WhatsApp, Shazam, Instagram, Safari, Keynote, Powerpoint, Excel, Traktor. <br><br>  <b>Which life hack helps you save time?</b> <br>  Layfhaka two: one - about concentration, the second - about optimization. <br><ol><li>  Close the safari, put the phone in the backpack, sit in silence and think. </li><li>  Learn and work behind the wheel.  Every day I spend about 2 hours in the car, it would be a pity to lose this time.  English radio stations - not to forget the language, audiobooks - not to be stupid, and silence, if you need to invent. </li></ol><br><br>  <b>What kind of to-do manager do you use?</b> <br>  Everything is trivial: a calendar with reminders, notes and a piece of paper with a pen.  Paper with a pen is closest to me: all tasks are always before my eyes. <br><br>  <b>What do you listen when you work?</b> <br>  Depends on the type of work: when you need to invent, you need complete silence.  When to issue, analyze, etc. - BBC radio 1xtra <br><br>  <b>What are you reading now?</b> <br>  So it turns out that I am simultaneously trying to read several books.  1) Andr√© Ruill√© about photography, 2) Charles S. Jacobs ‚ÄúNeuromanagement‚Äù and 3) Martin Lindstrom Buyology.  It's funny, but all of them are not fiction at all. <br><br>  <b>Which book from the last read was remembered the most?</b> <br>  From the most recent - Malcolm Gladwell ‚ÄúThe Tipping Point: How To Make A Big Difference‚Äù is about why and how epidemics are born: from fashion to crime.  And how to make your product really popular.  A very entertaining book for someone who wants to understand why he suddenly began to like New Balance. <br><br>  <b>Do you use e-readers or prefer paper books?</b> <br>  I like paper, but I don‚Äôt always manage to take a paper book with me.  If it does not work, I read from a laptop or phone.  There are no special gadgets. <br><br>  <b>How long do you sleep?</b> <br>  At some point, I realized that in order to be productive, I need to sleep 8 hours.  Now, with all my might, I try to find an extra 8 hours to sleep in a day.  It turns out not always, but I aspire. <br><br>  <b>Are you an owl or a lark?</b> <br>  I am an owl that suffers that lark.  The Moscow rhythm of life does not allow so far to go to bed at 12 and get up at 7, but I really want to.  So far it turns out to go to bed at 2 and get up at 8. <br><br>  <b>How do you have breakfast?</b> <br>  Carbohydrates.  I never thought that I would answer that way, but the last year was them: oatmeal, buckwheat ... not very fun, but nutritious.  Thanks to the coach and Sekta. <br><br>  <b>How do you spend your time on the way to work / from work?</b> <br>  I go to work behind the wheel, so I spend time as I described in life hacking: I study and work.  Sometimes I listen to news on BusinessFM, but, honestly, lately I try not to spoil their mood. <br><br>  <b>What advice you have ever been given can you convey to others?</b> <br>  Once I was told that the world is huge and there are no limits to human possibilities.  All that a person wants and can come up with - he can realize.  Everything.  For this you need to work, but it's worth it.  Since then, I have been inventing, I work a lot, and it's really worth it. <br><br>  I think this is one of the basic thoughts that small children need to talk about.  They should know that their world depends only on them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290334/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290334/</a></p>
