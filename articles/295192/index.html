      And they did it relatively honestly: they didn‚Äôt reduce everything to emotions, but they specificized their bu-bu-bu and recorded discontent and expectations in a separate list.  And they looked to see if something changes over time in the system interface. <br><br>  Here it is, a list.  Acquired by overwork and monthly royalties.  Exclamation marks <b>[!</b>  <b>]</b> - the fact that straight whip on the nerves every day. <br><br><ol><li>  <b>post office</b> <br><ol><li>  <b>[!</b>  <b>]</b> Auto-create contact by letter. </li><li>  <b>[!</b>  <b>]</b> Forward letters to the archive - and to immediately cling to the right contacts. </li><li>  <b>[!</b>  <b>]</b> Receive alerts by mail when something changes in an interesting (set by me or hanging on me) transaction, task, client. </li><li>  Receive alerts for tasks for tomorrow (now - only for overdue tasks). </li><li>  Put the archive address in a hidden, not in an explicit copy. </li><li>  Make the address of the archive in your domain. </li></ol><br></li><li>  <b>Notifications</b> <br><ol><li>  <b>[!</b>  <b>]</b> Notify the employee about important comments to the transaction or task. </li><li>  Be able to sign people on a task / question. </li><li>  Sign people up for updates on deals. </li><li>  Show notification on the page that has changed since the last download.  At least for the dashboard. </li></ol><br></li><li>  <b>Funnel</b> <br><ol><li>  <b>[!</b>  <b>]</b> See how long a deal has been hanging in a specific funnel status. </li><li>  <b>[!</b>  <b>]</b> In the Funnel view, under each stage, the number of transactions and the total amount are shown.  But this data does not change if you enable the filter (for example, by the person in charge).  It is necessary to change. </li><li>  Update the amount of funnel statuses after dragging a transaction card from status to status. </li><li>  Rename the status of closed transactions. </li></ol><br></li><li>  <b>Taxonomy</b> <br><ol><li>  <b>[!</b>  <b>]</b> See a list of deals and contacts for which there <i>are</i> no tasks <i>at all</i> (and you <i>do</i> n‚Äôt <i>have any tasks</i> ). </li><li>  <b>[!</b>  <b>]</b> Apply the filter "Objects without tags" (or "Objects without tags such and such"). </li><li>  <b>[!</b>  <b>]</b> Search with transliteration: I want to find the Infosreda card by entering ‚ÄúInfosreda‚Äù, the ‚ÄúDiary.ru‚Äù card by Dnevnik, ‚ÄúAlpha‚Äù - by alfa.  Especially for first and last names. </li><li>  Enter the label in the name through # without frills. </li><li>  Automatically prompt the country and city after entering the first two letters. </li><li>  The default country is to be Russia, not ‚Äúempty.‚Äù </li><li>  Where and how to edit tags (correct typo)? </li></ol><br></li><li>  <b>Tasks</b> <br><ol><li>  <b>[!</b>  <b>]</b> To set the task status "Make someday." </li><li>  <b>[!</b>  <b>]</b> From the ‚ÄúOverdue - Today - Tomorrow‚Äù view you cannot switch from a teaser for a task to a task card.  Click and begs, but it does not work. </li><li>  <b>[!</b>  <b>]</b> In the task list the full text of the task is not visible, only service data (not always filled) - as a result, all space is occupied by empty long columns of equal width. </li><li>  A task can be deleted only by going to the task card - but not from the task list. </li><li>  He closed the task - it would be nice if the system offered to start a new one and open the input form.  But no, it does not. </li><li>  In the calendar is not visible at all a piece of a complete description of the task in a free form. </li></ol><br></li><li>  <b>Integration</b> <br><ol><li>  <b>[!</b>  <b>]</b> To hammer into the integration module with Facebook the address of the person‚Äôs page explicitly. </li><li>  <b>[!</b>  <b>]</b> Store attachments in Dropbox - one for all accounts (corporate). </li><li>  Closely integrate with Facebook, LinkedIn and VKontakte. </li><li>  Integrate with Skype.  At least make a link to Skype clickable mode? Chat, to start a dialogue. </li></ol><br></li><li>  <b>Contacts</b> <br><ol><li>  <b>[!</b>  <b>]</b> Filter by "Facebook Contact". </li><li>  Filter by Subscribed to the Newsletter. </li><li>  Correct phone number format automatically. </li></ol><br></li><li>  <b>Cards</b> <br><ol><li>  <b>[!</b>  <b>]</b> If you click on a letter in the history of events, it opens so that you can see the first 3-4 lines.  And you need to scroll in a narrow area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe screen to read the entire letter.  The entire letter on the screen does not display at all. </li><li>  <b>[!</b>  <b>]</b> In the transaction history of events, each letter must be clicked to read it.  That is, you can not scroll through the tape of events to quickly dive into the context. </li><li>  <b>[!</b>  <b>]</b> Stick a comment to the top of the card so as not to crawl down. </li><li>  Redesign contact card: it is unclear offhand, by whom and in which company does a name work.  Responsible is above the post. </li><li>  The list of deals in the company card is very low: under the info about the company and its contact persons.  There he is invisible - you need to constantly scroll to find out if there is a deal with this company.  Obviously, should be at the top right, where the tasks and comments. </li></ol><br></li><li>  <b>Total ux</b> <br><ol><li>  Customizable desktop view: I want to see my tasks and related contacts instead of a general list. </li><li>  Search forms are in the list (for example, contacts), but not on the card (the same contact).  It is necessary to switch back and forth. </li></ol><br></li></ol>  By the way, the list shows well the specifics of user requirements for professional systems - and their difference from queuing interfaces.  In short, so. <br><ol><li>  The seamlessness of switching between environments is very important: ‚ÄúThe main - mail - contiguous‚Äù. </li><li>  What is happening or available in the focus of attention (roughly speaking, the inscription button and a couple of centimeters around) - much more important than what happens on the page or in the system as a whole. </li><li>  The absence of an object or label - critical information for decision making.  Much more important than their presence. </li><li>  All the most important is stored in a poorly structured area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe object (task descriptions, letter text, etc.).  And you can not hide it, hoping that people "thanks to" this will be engaged in bringing the data in order. </li><li>  The mode of use ‚ÄúA quick overview and getting a general impression‚Äù is just as important as the mode ‚ÄúCareful viewing of the list item by item‚Äù. </li></ol><br>  Suddenly, someone from CRMs will get better <i>at</i> this collection of our grievances ( <i>in fact, not, because this is not how UX is done, and we know about it</i> ). <br><br>  In the meantime, the CRM system interface has evolved. <br>  And absolutely nothing that sting us, has changed. <br><br>  It may seem that we are offended that the system interface is not developing there.  Like, we know how to, only we, specialists, have not been asked. <br><br>  Nah  Worse. <br><br>  The fact is that we have no idea whether a company is listening to users.  We, as clients, were not asked about anything.  Only sometimes it was reported that this CRM and its creators had a fucking UX-expertise.  And they offered to persuade in something and argue about something, if somewhere in the interface it presses. <br><br>  Well, OK, we chose a way to talk about it - changed the system. <br><br>  This story, unfortunately, is typical for Russian business. <br>  "We know better how to make you comfortable." <br>  Well, no, guys, well, do not know!  And the experience does not save here. <br>  Especially the leaders of all markets applies. <br>  That is why we do not call the system: does it make sense to spread rot to someone concrete, if such behavior is the norm? <br><br>  In general, our patience is over. <br>  And we scored on import substitution. <br><br>  From today we use <a href="http://www.pipedrive.com/">CRM Pipedrive</a> (their <i>slogan is wild, do not be scared</i> ). <br>  The active phase of migration - from the decision to the beginning of work in the new system - took an hour and a half. <br>  Let's see what rakes will be there. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295192/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295192/</a></p>
