  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where to get capital to budding entrepreneurs - continued</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Not so long ago, he wrote about possible <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/124262/">measures of support for aspiring entrepreneurs</a> .  I decided to go through the whole process on my own and check whether you can really get some help from the state. <br>  I will try to highlight the following points: <br>  1. Seminars (introduction to entrepreneurial activity) <br>  2. Writing a business plan <br>  3. Protection of the business plan <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, after all the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/124262/">procedures</a> that we go through in the CZ, we are sent to a training seminar. <br><br><h4>  What is this training about? </h4><br>  In my case, all the training lasted 3 days, I think that this is a generally accepted moment and the process is the same in all cities.

    <h5>  Course content: </h5><br>  1. Psychology of entrepreneurship.  Questions about the readiness to become an entrepreneur are being considered, or it is not too late to abandon this idea and go to work for an uncle, even tests have been written. <br>  2. Budgeting.  For the most part, this section is needed to write the financial part of the business plan, it was described how to fill in the tables (which are issued) containing the profit and loss forecast, as well as the cash flow forecast. <br>  3. Registration of the enterprise.  They tried to explain how to register a particular form of activity.  But I can say that in theory, much is not clear, you have to understand in practice. <br>  4. Marketing.  In my opinion the most interesting section.  It was led not by a theorist, but by a businessman who is currently the founder of several companies and was ready to answer interesting questions, including  not related to marketing, advertising and promotion.  It was also interestingly told about personnel management, for economists nothing new will be discovered, but it is quite possible to adopt practical advice. <br>  5. Taxes.  The same story as with the section on the registration of an enterprise, a lot of words, it is not easy to understand with the summer, but in general it will give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe tax system. <br><br>  All sections are conducted by different people, in general, only a good impression has been gained about the course, I recommend listening to it! <br>  Engaged in the first day from 9:00 to 17:00, in the second until 18:00, in the third until 14:00 <br><br><h4>  Writing a business plan </h4><br>  Then follows the stage of writing a business plan and consultation with experts about the adjustment of one or another part. <br>  Up to this point, it is highly desirable to accurately determine the direction of your business. <br>  I don‚Äôt know how to practice, but one of the commission members said that only 1 out of 10 people receive a grant for Internet projects.  Initially I planned to write BP for the Internet project, but after such an attitude I decided to change the approach. <br><br><h4>  Business plan protection </h4><br>  In order not to exhibit the Internet project in its pure form and to receive a subsidy with a greater likelihood, I decided to do Internet activity as one of the activities of the organization, I also focused on IT consulting. <br>  The defense was attended by 7 people, questions were asked about market entry and work experience.  In general, nothing complicated and fast enough, though I had to stand in the queue for about an hour, but the defense itself lasted 5 minutes. <br>  Immediately after the defense, they gave a positive answer, tomorrow I will go to conclude an agreement, within 10 days the money will be transferred to the current account created for receiving unemployment benefits. <br><br>  I was pleasantly surprised by the work of the CZ, now I was convinced from my own experience that it would be possible to get support, there would be a desire. <br>  So I can advise all novice entrepreneurs to go this way, even if the amount is not so big, but this is a nice bonus for a startup! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125548/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125548/</a></p>
