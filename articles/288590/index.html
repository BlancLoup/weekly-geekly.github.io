  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to promote your blog: mistakes, winding on a mustache, best practices (novice bloggers and developers of these)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day to all habrazhiteli. <br><br>  I am a mathematician by my first education, and I have already finished my magistracy in the specialty Information Technologies in the USA. <br><br>  I have not worked in the specialty (IT specialist) for a year and a half, but I still can not let go of IT for all time.  A year ago, started a blog on WordPress (self hosted) and decided to write about urgent issues.  In addition, it would give me the opportunity to poke around in codes and databases, which I just can not forget.  He wrote for friends and friends of friends.  I wanted to gather a certain community of pleasant and intelligent people.  Looking ahead to say what happened. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I chose a hosting service, bought a domain, screwed it up and installed everything.  The case is simple.  Wrote the first article.  There was a question - how to declare yourself?  How to let people know that my blog exists at all?  Put a link to the article as a status in Skype, an agent, in ‚ÄúMy World‚Äù I installed it on facebook.  I am waiting.  Silence.  What to do?  I went to adwords.google.com, started an account, put 10 dollars and, choosing keywords, I launched a campaign.  By a little people went. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Quickly wrote a second article.  According to statistics, I saw the N-th number of people who came from facebook.  At that time there were my friends in the amount of about a hundred.  I quickly realized that if I had more friends, then there would be more resonance on share articles.  Began to add to friends all those who recommended the Facebook system.  You may know - YES.  You may know - YES.  Quickly scored about 500 people.  In the meantime, put another 10 dollars on adwords.google.com.  Little by little, activity appeared. <br>  Under the articles put the share buttons in various soc.  networks - a must have bar! <br><br>  Since the blog was not originally conceived as a commercial one, there was no goal to make money on the site.  I did not want to spend a lot of money on promotion.  In the meantime, he dug out his password from VKontakte and began to tell articles about it.  The minimum resonance from this was.  On Facebook, meanwhile, the number of my friends has exceeded 1000. The system blocked me for a couple of weeks a couple of times due to the fact that I was adding friends too intensively. <br><br>  Pat I read about how Facebook filters the most interesting statuses and my race for a bunch of friends turned out to be almost useless, which is very sad. <br><br>  By the way, I almost forgot to say about twitter - as a popularization of articles, he showed himself extremely badly.  Transitions from tweeter were and are single. <br><br>  There were almost no visitors from search engines.  It was necessary to solve this problem.  Picked up in a heap of plug-ins, chose one, I don‚Äôt know if you can call it here and make an advertisement, so I won‚Äôt.  His whole point is to ensure that it improves the readability of articles for search engines.  I do not part with this plugin to this day.  Almost immediately (in a week or two) people went from Google and Yandex.  I was wildly pleased. <br><br>  There are people who also wanted to share their thoughts.  Began to recruit a team of regular hacks and chitak. <br><br>  At that time, the theme and design of the site was ‚ÄúFactory‚Äù from WordPress.  He began to think about the logo and color scheme.  Announced a contest for the best logo.  Wrote the basic wishes.  Fallen options.  Horror!  Among all I chose a more or less interesting idea.  I finished it with a designer from St. Petersburg and put it in a hat.  Everything has become more beautiful.  There was a logo.  Now when you make articles from a blog, there is a site logo next to it.  Super! <br><br>  I forgot to say that after 3 months I stopped financing advertising.  And without this, there was enough visitors and communication. <br><br>  In the initial stages I tried advertising on facebook.  Spent a couple of tens of dollars and realized that the return is very weak and such advertising is expensive. <br>  I want to note that after 2 months my blog was the first in a certain ranking of blogs by attendance throughout the country (I will not do advertising, I will answer in the comments if it is interesting).  Now we hang out in the top ten. <br><br><h5>  In general, summarizing, tips on the promotion of novice blogs: </h5><br>  1. It is necessary to take care of good readability of articles for search engines.  Be sure to set the correct tags, keywords and metadata.  By default, the blogging platform may be poorly indexed by search engines. <br>  2. Be sure the presence of various share buttons on social networks under articles.  This will bring a decent percentage of visitors to your site. <br>  3. Allow comments without registration.  Otherwise, you can push people away from the registration process. <br>  4. Allow to log in already existing social accounts.  Networks.  There is no need for registration and has people to comment. <br>  5. Provide ratings of articles and comments.  So users will be able to express their opinion, which, of course, will position them positively in relation to your site. <br>  6. To provide somewhere on the main page (in my right next to the menu) an activity column: such a user commented on such an article, User1 replied to User2, etc.  So users can respond to events faster and easier. <br>  7. It is advisable to provide a chat like facebook chat (at the bottom of the site).  So users will be able to meet and communicate in real time, which of course will have a positive impact on the popularity of the blog.  Again, it is not necessary to register to start communicating. <br>  8. Of course, it is advisable to get acquainted with everyone and even meet in real life ... for example, having a beer or a game of mafia. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288590/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288590/</a></p>
