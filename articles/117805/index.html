Never before have we been able to fit so many innovations in a single release of any Evernote application.  We added support for sharing, organizing notes, improved text editing, security settings, new viewing modes, an updated widget, and many other things. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://ht ">Download Evernote from the Android Market</a> or check for updates.</strong> <br><br><h2>  Navigating and editing shared notebooks </h2><br>  Every time someone gives you access to your notebook, you can link this notebook to your account.  Evernote for Android now allows you to view the contents of all linked notebooks.

This feature makes Evernote a great mobile collaboration tool. <br><br>  To access shared notebooks, click on the new ‚ÄúShared Notebooks‚Äù icon on the Evernote home screen.  You will see a list of available notebooks linked to your account.  Click on the notepad to view it.  If you want this notebook to be synchronized every time along with your account, then in the appeared menu select the ‚ÄúSynchronization‚Äù item. <br><br>  <strong>Premium feature:</strong> If you are a premium subscriber, then you can download the contents of a notebook to a mobile device, which will allow you to work with its contents even without an Internet connection (i.e., make it an ‚Äúoffline notepad‚Äù).  Just remember that while you are without the Internet, the owner of the notebook or someone else can edit it.  You will see the changes made only after the next synchronization <br><br><h2>  Posting to Facebook and other apps </h2><br>  Now you can quickly and easily post any single note to Facebook or other applications (including Twitter) right from your phone.  As soon as you have a great idea or you see something interesting, you can save this information in Evernote and instantly share it with people who may be interested. <br><br><img src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/image05.jpg" title="image05" width="500" height="438"><br><br>  <strong>Facebook posting</strong> <br>  To add a note to Facebook, open it, click on the ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù button and select ‚ÄúPublish‚Äù.  You will be asked to log in to your Facebook account, and then you will be able to share this note.  It's simple. <br><br>  <strong>Sending to other applications</strong> <br>  You can also send a separate note to other used applications, such as Gmail or Twitter.  To do this, click on the "Menu" button, then "Advanced" and select "Share". <br><br><h2>  Search and create notes inside notebooks </h2><br>  Now you have the ability to search in any notebook that you are viewing.  Finding notes inside a specific notebook reduces the number of results found.  To start a search inside a separate notebook, select it in the list, and then click on the magnifying glass icon.  The second option under the search box, which you will see, just offers a search for a specific notebook. <br><br><img src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/image001.png" title="image00" width="320" height="120"><br><br>  Also, whenever you are in a specific notebook and create a note, it will be placed in this current notebook. <br><br><h2>  Creating and editing notebooks, as well as improved support for notebook sets </h2><br>  Creating notebooks is no longer the exclusive privilege of desktop clients.  Now Evernote for Android also allows you to create notepads.  To do this, click on the "Notebooks" icon on the application home screen.  Then click on the "Menu" button and select "New Notepad."  If you want to rename the notebook, press and hold your finger on the name of the notebook in the list. <br><br>  This update also includes support for grouping notebooks in sets.  When you view your list of notebooks, you can fold sets to hide unnecessary notebooks.  Press and hold your finger on a notebook to move it into an existing set or create a new one. <br><br><h2>  Maps and geo-coordinates </h2><br>  If your device is equipped with a GPS module, Evernote will record your location every time you create a note (as it was before).  And now you can view all these notes on the map.  Whenever you view the list of notes, you can select the ‚ÄúMap‚Äù option by pressing the ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù button.  You can scale the map to see more precisely where your notes were created.  Simply click on the desired point on the map to view all the notes taken in this place.  You can also go to your current location by clicking on the compass, and view all the notes taken on the currently visible part of the map by clicking on the informer with the number in the upper right. <br><br><img src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/image04.png" title="image04" width="336" height="403"><br><br>  <strong>Adding location information: great for planning a trip</strong> <br>  In addition to marks on the map for new notes, you can also fill in the location information for existing ones.  To do this, open the note editor, and then click the ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù button.  Select "Set Location" and place a pin on the map in the area to which you would like to carry the note.  This feature is useful when you are planning a trip.  Specify for these notes the place that you plan to visit, and when you get there, you just need to use the pin icon on the map in the upper right corner to find all the notes associated with this place. <br><br><h2>  New premium feature: PIN access to your account </h2><br>  You asked about this feature, and here it is.  Now you can block access to the Evernote application by PIN-code.  Each time you return to the application, you will be asked to enter this code.  This is useful in cases when you use your smartphone or tablet together with other people and want to protect access to your notes from prying eyes.  One of the interesting features of this feature is that you can still create quick notes through the widget, even if the application is closed.  You just can not view your notes and search for them until you enter a PIN code. <br><br><img src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/image011.png" title="image01" width="320" height="145"><br><br>  You can set the PIN code in the application settings.  To change or disable the PIN, return to the PIN Lock screen and enter the code again.  If you enter your PIN incorrectly three times, you will be asked to enter a password for your account. <br><br>  This feature is available to premium subscribers. <br><br><h2>  Updated widget </h2><br>  We completely redesigned the Evernote widget.  The widget allows you to quickly navigate to the necessary functions of the application for creating text, voice and photo notes, as well as for searching through notes.  To install the widget, tap and hold your finger on the Android home screen.  Then click on the ‚ÄúWidgets‚Äù item in the pop-up menu. <br><br><img src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/image02.png" title="image02" width="336" height="83"><br><br><h2>  Improved interface </h2><br>  We also implemented a couple of useful interface improvements. <br><ul><li>  <strong>More information on the home screen:</strong> A new download bar will more informatively show what the application is currently syncing. </li><li>  <strong>Tag Hierarchy:</strong> Nested tags created on your computer now appear in your tag list with respect to the nested structure. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  And much more </h2><br>  In addition to all of the above, the update introduces many other new features and capabilities, performance improvements, and bug fixes.  As always, we continue to work hard to please you in the future with an even greater number of new products.  Stay with us. <br><br>  <strong><a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.evernote">Download Evernote from Android Market</a></strong> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117805/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117805/</a></p>
