  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Induction</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> - Oh my goodness, they are so cute!  Exclaimed Susan when Carol showed her a maze of mice.  All the fun of laboratory animals was that they had colorful helmets on their heads, in which mice looked like little racers from the 70s anime.  The number 1 was drawn on the blue helmet, and the number 0 on red. <br>  - And why should they? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  - The numbers are needed just to distinguish them.  And helmets are my research project, or rather its important part.  I am studying the possibility of influencing the brain of an animal from the outside.  You see that antenna next to the cell ?, like any scientist, Carol loved to talk about her experiments. <br>  Susan turned her gaze to a stand-alone device that looked like a miniature TV tower. <br>  - This antenna transmits radio signals to the helmets of mice.  - Carol continued. <br>  ‚ÄúDo mice listen to the radio?‚Äù  Have you already set my songs? <br>  - Not really :-).  Have you heard anything about transcrinal magnetic stimulation?  Enough to google, I'll tell you myself now.  Antennas on helmets receive radio signals and convert them into electromagnetic radiation, the frequency of which can be perceived by the mouse's brain. <br>  - And why do you need it? <br>  - Look, now the mouse will run into the maze.  At the first fork in her choice, go right or left.  Behind one turn there is a small electric shock, and after another a tasty reward. <br>  - And what a reward?  A piece of cheddar ?, Susan presented a thick smell, then thought of four cheeses about the pizza, and then came to their senses, recalling the day of her acquaintance with Carol. <br>  They met at a concert in honor of the start of the school year in the student hostel of the Omicron Persei brotherhood, where Susan lived.  She then played in the rock group ‚ÄúNoisy, loud, deafening,‚Äù and her main principle of playing the rhythm of the guitar was: play in such a way as to drown out how the rest of them play.  It is not known whether Susan's loud game was the cause, or the insane amount of beer that was drunk at those parties, but the group was invariably followed by a standing ovation.  Maybe it was the support of the hall and gave Susan confidence in the break to go to the sad blonde in the corner with the words: <br>  - Hey, don't be so sad.  I sometimes even cry in our rehearsals. <br>  - That's not the point.  - smiled, answered Carol. <br>  And after 5 minutes, she told Susan that the boy had left her, and that she didn‚Äôt know what to do next, because she would probably need to move out of his apartment, and she even has no idea where.  After another 5 minutes, Susan found out that Carol is doing research in the field of neuropsychology, that her favorite group is Red Hot Chili, and her favorite character in friends is Phoebe, because ‚ÄúPoobe is cool‚Äù. <br>  After the break, Susan climbed back onto the stage, took the guitar from the stand and announced: <br>  - I decided to sing this song to remind you that at any moment there may be a person next to you who needs your help.  Do not hesitate - help him, it will make you a little better. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMy friends are so depressed <br>  I feel the question of loneliness <br>  Confide, cause you be on your side <br>  You know I will, you know I will ‚Äù <br><br>  After the party, Susan offered Carol to stay in her dorm room, as her two neighbors left for a few months to practice and their beds were free.  And then until 4 am they drank beer, ate pizza Four cheeses and watched the favorite series of the series Friends.

      - So what's up with the cheese?  - Susan pretended not to hear the answer, and asked again. <br>  - The role of the award is not played by cheese, if you are talking about this, but soaked wheat.  And in general, the fact that mice love cheese is a stereotype. - Carol continued.  She definitely gained the ability to enjoy the teachings with the genes from her father.  - So, the mouse runs up to the fork, each time the maze is random, and the mouse does not know where to turn: right or left.  For which turn the reward, and for what electric shock?  But you and I know and can try to tell.  The main question is: will the mouse understand us? <br>  - And how will we do it?  - Susan seems seriously interested in the experiment. <br>  - A large antenna on the table is connected to my computer.  You see a labyrinth and you know that now the reward is around the left turn.  If you enter into the terminal ‚Äútalk mouse1 left‚Äù, the antenna will begin to transmit a signal to helmet number 1, which prompts the mouse to turn left.  Will she listen to him - the choice is her.  I do not control the behavior of the mouse, but rather create a premonition that the right choice is to turn left. <br>  What does the mouse feel like?  Intuition?  God's voice?  I do not know, in any case, the mouse does not submit to this directly. <br><br>  Meanwhile, the mouse paused for a while at the fork, turned right. <br><br>  - You see, the result is far from ideal.  The mouse listens to the voice in 6 cases out of 10. But it is worth saying that at the beginning of the experiment it was 5 out of 10. It seems that the mouse's brain is gradually being adjusted.  The only pity is that the setting is not very fast. <br><br>  Susan thought: <br>  - You do not think that this is immoral in relation to mice? <br>  - Immoral?  I think not.  I do not eat them in the end.  - In almost every conversation about morality, Carol inserted this subtext ‚Äúhey, if you talk about morality, you eat poor chickens,‚Äù - And by the way, there is a chapter on experiment ethics in my work, I wrote it first, it ends like this.  ‚ÄúI want to give mice something that even we don‚Äôt have: the ability to see through walls.‚Äù <br>  - It is more like fiction than a PhD thesis.  Are you going to be published in ‚ÄúAsimov's science fiction‚Äù?  - faked her in response to Susan. <br>  - Well, you know, in science you will not achieve anything without imagination.  And if you are worried that the current in the right turn is too big ... Come closer and hold it right here and here, I need to calibrate the generator. <br>  Although Susan had known her friend for a long time, she was still bought into the old world as a joke. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  On rare occasions when Carol decided to take a break from work, she called Susan.  The friends gathered in the small coffee shop ‚ÄúBig bang theory‚Äù opposite the campus and sat there until closing time.  Their favorite entertainment was the dramatization of the episodes of Friends, Carol asked the topic and spoke for Rachel, Monica and Phoebe, and Susan picked up Chandler, Joey and Ross: <br>  ‚ÄúLast night, I dreamed ... that you and I ... were doing it on the table ...‚Äù <br>  - Sleep on 5 points! <br>  ‚ÄúWhy did you even dream about it?‚Äù <br>  - More importantly, was I good? <br>  ‚ÄúOh yes, you were damn good.‚Äù <br>  - It is strange, in my dreams I am usually helpless. <br>  ‚ÄúLast night you knew exactly what you were doing.‚Äù <br>  It looked crazy and cute from the outside, especially when they brought a tape recorder with them to add offscreen laughter to the replicas.  There was no shortage of people wanting to take part in their fun, the guys often drove up, but the girls never met anyone.  Carol was still experiencing her break, and at the same time she was afraid that the new novel would take time and energy so necessary for research.  And Susan just liked to shoot the guys off, the ability to resist the men developed from her childhood. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  In October, the girls barely saw each other, Carol went completely to her research project, and Susan‚Äôs rock band was often invited to play parties in their town.  After one of these parties, Susan almost fell into a dream when the phone suddenly vibrated.  She fumbled around the bed for a long time before finding it.  Susan was not at all surprised when she saw that the message was from Carol: <br>  ‚ÄúI think I have a breakthrough!  Be sure to come to my university tomorrow. ‚Äù <br>  In the morning, Susan jumped in for sandwiches and coffee and came to the lab. <br>  - Did you not go to bed?  - from the threshold she asked a question, the answer to which she already knew. <br>  - Not.  I also ate the last time about 10 hours ago, and have not taken off this white robe for ages. <br>  The fact that Carol had not been in the shower for a long time, Susan understood right away, but she loved the smell and did not say anything. <br>  ‚ÄúIt's good that Carol hasn't yet invented a device for reading thoughts, otherwise I would have to blush too often with shame,‚Äù thought Susan. <br>  - Thank you very much for the sandwich, you are my savior.  Yesterday morning I came up with something, and I worked on it for the last 24 hours, ‚ÄùCarol began to tell.  - The idea is simple: instead of teaching the mouse to listen to the voice, why not the voice learn to speak correctly with the mouse?  I replaced the input terminal with a cluster of computers with a neural network.  The neural network has only one task: it will learn to control the mouse better.  Wait, here contacts sometimes go away sometimes, I soldered in a hurry. <br>  Carol leaned over to fix the wires to the antenna, and Susan realized that she didn't have anything under the bathrobe.  Apparently Susan held her gaze on the neckline for too long, through which her nipples were almost visible, because Carol said: <br>  ‚ÄúHey friend, my eyes are taller! .. And do you think I'm sexy?‚Äù  Hmm ... so here: if the mouse gets to the prize, the network considers this a favorable event, and vice versa.  Variables in the equation are sufficient: this is both the frequency and power of the pulse, the duration and the moment of the pulse, and of course the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe brain where this pulse can be directed.  Now I am conducting experiments and gathering statistics for the network.  So the network is training.  I hoped that the neural network would select the optimal parameters and it looks like it happens.  Late at night, I started a new series of tests, and count up, the mice are rolling in the right direction in 75% of the experiments! <br><br>  *** <br><br>  Carol and Susan spent Halloween in the lab.  Carol didn‚Äôt like this holiday, her whole costume was that she stuck a red cross on a bathrobe and announced that now she was a nurse.  But Susan persuaded her to dress up mice in red-blue and black superhero costumes.  True to get such suits turned out to be a daunting task.  At first, Susan tried to find costumes for mice in nearby stores, but the sellers only twisted their fingers at the temple when they understood what she wanted.  As a result, Susan realized that it was easier to sew herself.  The cloaks made of scraps of an old laboratory tablecloth gave them similarity with prototypes. <br>  - By the way, Suze, if you arrange a tournament between them, do you think which one of them will win? <br>  ‚ÄúDidn't you watch this superhero movie?‚Äù  In the end, they agree and unite against you. <br>  - Well, thank you for the spoiler! <br>  - Oh you might think the ending is not clear from the title itself. <br>  - Well, in any case now it will be difficult.  I redid something.  Look, - Carol showed the wires lying in apparent disorder on the table. <br>  Looking closely, Susan saw the system.  The wires formed a web, on the edges of which transmitting antennas were installed, and in the center - a powerful desktop server XYZ. <br>  ‚ÄúYes, I had to add antennas, now each mouse has its own frequency,‚Äù explained Carol. ‚ÄúAnd thanks to the server upgrade, the neural network that controls the helmets has quickly evolved, and the mice have become much more obedient.  In making decisions in the labyrinth, they almost completely trust the signal.  The probability of the mouse ignoring the hint is extremely small.  The neural network has actually become a mouse god. <br>  "Is she again without a bra, is she mocking something?", - flashed a thought in Susan's head. <br>  - And I changed the conditions of the experiment.  Firstly, I removed the current, now after one turn there is a reward, and after the other - just nothing.  And secondly, now the neural network purposefully deceives mice.  Knowing where the prize is, she suggests the wrong answer.  What do you think happened? <br>  - Probably the mouse stopped listening to the wrong tips? <br>  - Nothing like this!  Most continue to rely on the solution broadcast antennas.  And only 7% of mice dare to choose the opposite answer. <br>  ‚ÄúWell, what is it like for you to be in these 7%, doesn't it hurt?‚Äù Asked an inner voice in Susan‚Äôs head.  ‚ÄúBut to hell with everything‚Äù - she answered herself, and said aloud: <br>  - Hmmm, how interesting.  By the way, I have a great story on this topic.  A couple of years ago, I was hiking in Europe.  Not far from Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãI walked along the foot of Mount Tibidabo and at the end of the path I saw a clearing, and behind it was a lake.  There were tall trees around, dead silence, splendor, and on the other side of the lake I saw a beautiful woman ... <br>  - I understood everything, come here already. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  - How is it at work today?  How far has it gone ?, - met Susan with a question with a friend. <br>  ‚ÄúUgums,‚Äù Carol answered, eating a hummus sandwich.  - I think I found an interesting development of the experiment.  I modified the helmet from the receiver to the receiver-transmitter.  Not everything is ready yet.  But tomorrow, I think, mice will not only listen to the signal with someone else‚Äôs hint, but sometimes broadcast their decision to all other mice.  We'll have to change the conditions a bit so that all the mice go through the maze at the same time.  But it is not difficult. <br>  - Stop, so you actually connect the mouse to the Internet ?! <br>  - Yes.  And I'm very interested to see the results. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373879/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373879/</a></p>
