I became her unwitting participant, and now I want to tell habrakhabr visitors about it. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.ingener.info/news-view-698.html">The next breakdown of the bodywork processing monster, released in the 80s and slightly upgraded in the 90s, with a proud professional type of ‚Äúmachining center‚Äù</a> made it possible for representatives of various service <s>confessions</s> to gather near it. <br><br>  The breakdown is not quite typical and a little frightening with manifest consequences in the case when the operator did not have time to react and manually turn off the ‚Äúmonster‚Äù.  By mistake, the position of <a href="http://www.ingener.info/pages-cat-7.html">the CNC system was</a> removed from the tracking of the <a href="http://www.ingener.info/pages-cat-6.html">electric drive</a> and "watched" together with the service personnel for the fall of the "hanging" coordinates, i.e.  vertically moving the spindle group and balanced hydraulics ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Next comes a long description of the specific exile approaches of the devilry, but I described them in the full version on the website <a href="http://www.ingener.info/">of automation engineers</a> , for the people who are inexperienced in these matters, I will write only the most tasty things.

      <s>Interested in the process of reading the full version of the links above</s> <br>  ... The result of the brain effort was the assumption of poor performance of the electromechanical engine brake, which was decided to confirm by replacing ... <br>  ... Appearing in an hour or two to find out how things are I see the picture: the dull electronics and the rapidly moving electricians with a triumphant: "We said that it was not the engine, with that ALSO FALLS!".  I ask a gloom: falls?  - Yes, he says, and he fell down with far greater acceleration than before and almost all of them peeled ... <br><br>  I shout to the electricians stuttering to wrap up: "STAY!".  They do not hear, although they all see.  As a result, I‚Äôm wrapping them up, explaining the presence of a relay, as well as two wires to the brake that are not checked and can lead to the same situation (electricians never check the brake before removing the engine, apparently someone told them the secret about the meaninglessness of the action) .  Just in case, I ask, they have put the same engine - they nod that they are not fools.  I am interested, when they put the engine, the brake held well, did not roll the shaft?  - Answer: "Everything was spinning perfectly, with one hand" - Curtain ... <br><br>  No one can believe, in shock, even the operator, it comes to the electrician slowly, slowly ...
