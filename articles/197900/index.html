      For clues, I inform you that the photographs were found in the American calligraphic journal <b>Penman's Art Journal of the</b> beginning of the last century. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Number one</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  This ... I did not know what Indian ink used to be, I had to google it.  It turned out that <b>Indian ink</b> is the same as Chinese ink: a durable gas soot suspension mixed with shellac (it was necessary to google again: <b>shellac</b> , or gummillak - resinous substance released by varnish cherries on shoots of tropical plants), brown (google for the third time: <b>borax</b> - sodium salt of boric acid, is found in the form of a mineral) or with soap and water. <br><br>  Here is what was said about the device in the source: <br><br><h5>  Electricity and calligraphy </h5><br>  A calligrapher who uses Indian ink (and if he is an artist in his field, he is obliged to use them), has to rub them for a long time.  The ink stick is rubbed on a tray containing a little water for twenty or thirty minutes, but the amount of ink produced in this way is still scanty.  This is one of the main reasons forcing calligraphers not to use Indian ink at all. <br><br>  To solve the problem, Journal Art employee <b>JF Briley</b> invented and patented a device known as the <b>‚ÄúIndian ink electric crusher‚Äù</b> .  The crusher ‚Äî its size is twenty inches long, seven tall, and six wide ‚Äî has an electric engine of about one-fifteenth horsepower, powered by four 6-volt miniature batteries.  The cost of crushing is one cent per hour, but if there is an electrical wire in the room that can be connected to the engine, the costs will be significantly reduced. <br><br>  The principle of operation is the worm gear known in mechanics, which performs 2000 revolutions per minute.  This is enough to ensure that the screw, on which the ink stick is attached, performs 360 movements per minute. <br><br>  Ink sticks for a dozen employees of the department in which Mr. Briley works work only on his car, which takes a few minutes a day, while a specially hired worker used to do this. <br><br>  The design of the device is remarkable, and, if it were a more common process, it would certainly provide the inventor with fame and recognition. <br><br>  <a href="">Source of</a> <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Number two</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  With number two, I confess, somewhat more complicated.  The idea seems to be clear, but the principle of operation of this digital thing and, most importantly, how to demonstrate something to students in this way (this is a tutorial) - thunder, I don‚Äôt understand. <br><br>  Here is the translation of the original article: <br><br><h5>  Horton's Study Room </h5><br>  Infrequently, devices with a name that is so difficult to pronounce it represent something, but it does.  It is a machine six feet high, five feet long and ten inches wide, with the ability to demonstrate 373 191 840 arithmetic examples for multiplication, division, percent calculation, etc.  The cabinet-type machine is designed to save time for math teachers who can simply press the lever to manipulate fifteen numbers arranged in ten columns.  Millions of numerical combinations occur consistently, with the result that errors are impossible, demonstration of an example, like the calculation itself, is carried out at lightning speed, and the teacher is relieved of writing numbers, so he pays more attention to explanations. <br><br>  Almost all the details of the Horton's numerological cabinet are steel, although for reasons of design or economy they can be made of wood.  The sizes are also possible different: at the office shown in the figure, the numbers are so large and clear that they can be read 90 feet away. <br><br>  The figure shows the lever ‚ÄúA‚Äù, with which 74,046 different numerical combinations are achieved, and the lever ‚ÄúB‚Äù, which produces 5,040 combinations.  When manipulating both levers, the number of combinations increases.  "C" and "E" - the curtains, with which you can adjust the height and length of the speakers, and "D" - a pulley with a cord that stretches to the "C". <br><br>  The numerological study is the invention of the teacher of calligraphy <b>L.K.</b>  <b>Horton</b> from New York.  It seems to us that a firm should be organized to produce and promote this miracle of human acumen. <br><br>  <a href="">Source of</a> <br><br>  Horton's numerological machine reminded me of another device for teachers of mathematics, a domestic one, and at least an understandable construction: an <b>arithmetic box</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/543/8aa/b1f/5438aab1f525d62260d9cd5460cb17f8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  How with the help of cubes you can learn mathematics, I also have little idea.  Well, if only the initial account in the kindergarten ... Although it is possible that I am in the most cruel and amateurish way mistaken about both devices.  I have problems with English (as a result, the translation is not only abbreviated, but also, let's say, artistic), and with a technical overview, the clinic is generally.  Plus an illegible text of the original, with which only the eyes are broken.  Therefore, I do not mind at all if they correct me. <br></div></div><br>  Thanks for attention. <br><br>  Previous posts in this cycle: <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/178155/">Mysterious stationery-1</a> , <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/179351/">Mysterious stationery-2</a> , <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/194362/">Mysterious stationery-3</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/197900/">https://habr.com/ru/post/197900/</a></p>
