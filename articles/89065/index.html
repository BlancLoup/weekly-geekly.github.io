      <b>UPD:</b> Updated photo and added important price info. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As you already understood, this is a GPS navigator from the Pocket Navigator company (Pocket Navigator, trite, but understandable) <br>  The company specializes exclusively in the production of navigators and a lot has progressed in this.  Of course, most functions <br>  navigators depends on the software that is installed in them, but sometimes the developers fill these helpers with motorists and some extra-functions, which I will talk about later. <br><br>  When you purchase the MW-500, you get an elegant glossy box in black and blue.  In principle - the standard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8d8/3cb/fc9/8d83cbfc929bce17ba905bf7fa634237.jpg"><br><br>  Its filling consists of: <br>  * Navigator MW-500 itself <br>  * AC adapter 220-230 V <br>  * Car holder for mounting on the windshield <br>  * Car charger <br>  * Wire for PC connection <br>  * Disk with user manual <br>  * Stylus <br>  * User's manual <br><br><img src="http://s39.radikal.ru/i083/1003/cc/e8c78387009a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In principle, everything is the same as in other navigators, but it is good that everything is present and you do not have to buy the mini-Usb wire to connect to a computer. <br><br>  I also liked the fact that there is a stylus in the navigator.  It will be convenient for accurate use and route guidance, as  sometimes with a finger <br>  you miss and you try to point you in the right direction for a long time. <br><br>  Well, another significant difference from my previous navigators and communicators with GPS is the big screen, which will be useful to you in navigation and in watching movies and reading books.  Oh, I spilled it out.  Well, nevertheless, I will tell you more later. <br><br>  Technical Specifications: <br>  * Processor: Atlas 372MHz <br>  * ROM: 512MB <br>  * RAM: 64MB <br>  * Screen: 5-inch diagonal, 480x272 <br>  * Operating System: Windows CE 5.0 <br>  * Memory card slots: SD <br>  * GPS receiver: SiRF Star III, up to 20 channels <br>  * Expansion slots: 1 slot with support for SD / MMC <br>  * Communications: <br>  - Support mini USB for PC connection <br>  - Speakerphone via Bluetooth technology <br>  * Multimedia features: <br>  - Built-in speaker <br>  - MP3 player <br>  - Video player <br>  - Image Browser <br>  - Text File Browser <br>  - Stereo <br><br>  On the surface there is only a lever for complete shutdown (and, respectively, resetting routes), a stylus and a hole for it: <br><br><img src="http://s19.radikal.ru/i192/1003/74/73126f6dcdad.jpg"><br><br>  Screen off button <br><br><img src="http://s40.radikal.ru/i090/1003/3e/4a463135ceb4.jpg"><br><br>  Speakers, 3.5mm headphone input, mini-USB connector for connecting to a computer and data transfer, SD card slot. <br><br><img src="http://i074.radikal.ru/1003/36/e1d2d0a08025.jpg"><br><br>  Just want to say that in this model PocketNavigator is Bluetooth, which can be used for various purposes. <br><br>  So, here is the navigator itself.  The body is compound.  The front part is glossy, with the inscription Pocket Navigator. <br>  Back-matte, slightly vinyl.  It is very convenient to hold in hand, because  almost non-slip <br><br><img src="http://i024.radikal.ru/1003/e4/8a3a6a200e53.jpg"><br><br>  But his mount for the car <br><br><img src="http://i073.radikal.ru/1003/4a/35c3facdfe0f.jpg"><br><br>  The device holds it tightly enough.  Adjusting the position in space is easy and convenient. <br><br><img src="http://i024.radikal.ru/1003/a2/a64f2dd6fa3f.jpg"><br><br>  But let's move on from the external mechanical properties to the filling, which I personally have a particular interest. <br>  Operating system: Windows CE.  It is more than enough for a device of this type. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/323/93a/597/32393a5976601606794ee68d462c3a5e.jpg"><br><br>  The navigator is loaded in 8-10 seconds. After that, you have 4 buttons: Actually, the navigation itself;  Multimedia;  Settings;  Volume. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d56/66f/47e/d5666f47e9433ce5ccdc09cc15a29c85.jpg"><br><br>  In the settings you can adjust the brightness, volume, etc. parameters. <br>  In the navigation is the program Autosputnik, they say that there are models with built-in iGo. But I do not have it. <br><br><img src="http://s12.radikal.ru/i185/1003/dd/f71be4c465d1.jpg"><br><br>  Satellites find on the street quickly enough.  Somewhere seconds 30 and your position in space is already defined. <br>  While the shooter had never gone astray, everything was clearly on the roads, the satellites did not turn off. <br>  In general, I will not delve into the software, because  You can actually deliver what you want. <br>  The autosatellite, for example, looks like this.  Conveniently enough, even to control a finger, but to more accurately set the route, you can use the stylus.  Quick and convenient. <br><br><img src="http://i054.radikal.ru/1003/bf/ea5a1c9d1883.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://s13.radikal.ru/i186/1003/47/5d54bdd5399b.jpg"><br><br>  And finally, multimedia: photo, audio, video, books, bluetooth. <br><br>  Agree, neplo for navigator.  Very convenient, especially if stuck in traffic - turn on the movie.  Of course, not enough just <br>  USB input to watch something from flash drives, but SD is enough. <br>  Everywhere built his player, very simple, but, most importantly - plays) <br><br>  Here are the speakers through which it sounds loudly and cleanly enough.  This, of course, is not 5.1 Dolby Digital, but for such a beast it is very good. <br><br><img src="http://i068.radikal.ru/1003/20/9a75c79ece94.jpg"><br><br>  Now I‚Äôll dwell on Bluetooth. <br>  With it, you can: <br>  a) transfer files <br>  b) Make a headset from the navigator (that is, connect it to the phone and use it as a speakerphone) <br>  This is very convenient, because  Do not over be distracted by the phone or buy separate hands-free devices in the car. <br><br>  Connecting to a PC is standard, as with all Windows Mobile devices, that is, you can upload files and maps through Explorer.  Or you can through the card.  Or bluetooth. <br><br>  In principle, this is all that I wanted to say about this device. <br><br>  His price is quite acceptable: 3990 rubles. <br>  When you exchange your old communicator for this new one, they will give you a discount of 1000r.  and it will cost 2990rub. <br><br>  About exchange read <a href="http://nabeba.ru/blog/like/33.html">HERE</a> <br><br>  I believe that such a screen and functions are better than just good, especially since it combines both a media player and an e-book and GPS. <br><br>  I will not evaluate it somehow by pluses and minuses.  Overall rating: 4+. <br>  It was pleasant: stylus, media applications, the big screen, earphones. <br>  Dislike: pixel interface. <br><br><img src="http://s61.radikal.ru/i172/1003/18/90fc9fe67468.jpg"><br><br>  In general - I advise all motorists who often stand in traffic jams and want to watch movies, listen to music or read books, while having a card on hand so as not to get lost. <br><br>  Link to off site: <a href="http://www.pocketnavigator.ru/products/mw500">PocketNavigator MW-500</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/89065/">https://habr.com/ru/post/89065/</a></p>
