It differs significantly from the previous one and includes information on recent advances in information technology.  For example, the chapter on Windows Vista is now replaced by a detailed review of Windows 8.1 as the most current version at the time of this writing.  There was a voluminous section on the Android operating system.  Unix, Linux, and RAID systems have been updated.  Much more attention has been paid to multi-core and multi-core systems, the importance of which has constantly increased in the past few years.  A brand new chapter on virtualization and cloud computing has appeared.  A large amount of new material has been added on the use of code errors, on malicious programs and the corresponding protection measures.  The book in a clear and fascinating form contains many important details that are not found in any other edition. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h5>  In more detail: </h5><br>  Chapter 1 has been significantly reworked and updated, but with the exception of the new section on mobile computers, no major sections have been added or removed. <br><br>  Chapter 2 is updated by removing obsolete and adding new material.  For example, a new futex sync primitive has been added and a section on how to completely avoid blocking using read-copy-update. <br><br>  Chapter 3 has become more focused on modern equipment and less focused on segmentation and MULTICS. <br><br>  The references to CDs have been removed from Chapter 4, since they have already lost their significance, and more modern solutions (flash drives) have taken their place.  Also to the section devoted to RAID-systems, added description of the RAID-array level 6. <br><br>  There are many changes to chapter 5.  It removed descriptions of obsolete devices, such as CRT displays and CD-ROM drives, and added devices developed using new technologies, such as touch screens. <br><br>  Chapter 6 is almost the same.  The topic of deadlocks, with the exception of some new results, remains virtually unchanged. <br><br>  Chapter 7 is completely new.  It is dedicated to the important topics of virtualization and cloud computing.  As a case study, a section on VMware has been added to it. <br><br>  Chapter 8 is an updated version of the previous multiprocessor material.  Now it focuses more on multi-core and multi-core systems, the importance of which has been increasing over the past few years.  Now here is raised the issue of consistency of cache data, which has recently become more acute. <br><br>  Chapter 9 has undergone substantial revision and reorganization, with the addition of a large amount of new material on the use of code errors, on malicious programs and the corresponding protection measures.  Such attacks as null pointer dereference and buffer overflow are considered in more detail.  Now a detailed description of the defense mechanisms, NX-bit and randomization of the address space, <br>  and the ways in which attackers try to overcome them. <br><br>  Chapter 10 has undergone significant changes.  The material concerning Unix and Linux has been updated, but the main addition can be considered a new rather voluminous section on the Android operating system, which is often found on smartphones and tablet computers. <br><br>  Chapter 11 in the third edition was devoted to Windows Vista.  Now it is replaced by a chapter on Windows 8, or rather Windows 8.1.  That is, now the chapter discusses the most current version. <br><br>  Chapter 12 is a revised version of Chapter 13 from the previous edition. <br><br>  Chapter 13 is a substantially updated list of material to be studied.  In addition, the list of references was supplemented with 223 new references to works published after the release of the third edition of this book. <br><br>  In addition, throughout the book, the sections are updated, which describes the research to reflect all the latest work related to operating systems.  In addition, new questions have been added to all chapters. <br><br>  More information about the book can be found on <a href="http://www.piter.com/collection/A20865/product/sovremennye-operatsionnye-sistemy-4-e-izd">the publisher's website.</a> <br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549601395/978549601395_X.pdf">Table of contents</a> <br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549601395/978549601395_p.pdf">Excerpt</a> <br>  For Habrozhiteley 25% discount coupon - <b>Tanenbaum</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/258275/">https://habr.com/ru/post/258275/</a></p>
