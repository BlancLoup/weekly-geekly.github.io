  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Messengers: communication channels</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We write and discuss a lot of messengers, their advantages and disadvantages, but the clear and clear goal of our company is to make the best correspondence tool that would help you not only to communicate and search for information, but also to get new friends and acquaintances.  If the majority of instant messengers are directed inward (you communicate there with those you already know), then the mission and development direction of ChaTeam is outwardly, in the discovery of new connections and channels. <br><br>  Groups, <i>rooms</i> or channels - this is all the name of the same place where users can communicate on topics of interest to them.  We call them simply - chats, so we will adhere to such terminology.  The ideology of each chat is to communicate on the chosen topic, which is interesting to all involved.  Cats, attractions, computer game or programming language - for everyone in ChaTeam there will be a channel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/166/156/b6f/166156b6f40046d4a5b21d1b20153907.jpeg" width="250"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b62/e92/cc7/b62e92cc76804646972ca1f3f698e78a.jpeg" width="250"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/904/f82/076/904f82076a6147cb806dee9576330e97.jpeg" width="250"><a name="habracut"></a>

      The first version of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/chateam/id947384514">‚ÄúChatim‚Äù for iOS has been</a> released this week, so we would like to talk about the channels and their types that exist in the app. <br><br>  In ChaTeam you can communicate via: <br><br>  <b>Public channel</b> - you can open your own, and each messenger user will be able to join it.  Such a channel has a name with a description, each user will be marked by his name in the correspondence.  Moderators (the creator of the chat and those whom he has given authority) will be able to disable unwanted.  The public channel is great for communication on interests and broad topics that are interesting to many people.  An actively working example of an open communication channel is our <a href="http://chateam.com/id175%3Futm_campaign%3DID03072015%26utm_source%3Dmegamozg.ru">tech-support chat</a> , where anyone can write about their wishes, difficulties, bugs in the application. <br><br>  <b>Closed channel</b> - it glows in the search with the name and description, but only those who are selected by the creator and moderators can communicate in it.  Such groups can be used, for example, for companies, public figures, it is convenient to talk about news and updates in them, limiting in advance the circle of people who can write to the general flow of messages.  Look at the channel <a href="http://chateam.com/id428%3Futm_campaign%3DID03072015%26utm_source%3Dmegamozg.ru">‚ÄúDevelopment of ChaTeam‚Äù</a> : developers report about their successes, but since the channel is closed, only they write to it.  Since there are no large streams of messages here, you will be able to follow the updates via push notifications, getting them directly to the home screen of the mobile device. <br><br>  <b>An anonymous channel</b> is an analogue of a public one, only all communication is not personalized.  The channel has a topic, description and moderator, only all users write not from themselves, but ‚Äúfrom that guy,‚Äù an anonymous character.  Correspondence is visible to everyone who joins the channel.  The closest analogue is the acclaimed Secret, in which each user was just an icon.  A year ago, the application marked the beginning of a whole series of anonymous followers, but then the communication there came to naught and the application was closed last month.  The power of anonymous channels, however, has not disappeared anywhere - it is a sought-after and interesting means of communication that can be used in the field of social support.  For example, for crisis services. <br><br>  <b>Private channel</b> - a closed channel that does not glow in the search.  Great place to chat with friends, relatives, family, work colleagues and work groups.  You invite the chosen ones to it, and in this circle you communicate on a variety of topics, without attracting outsiders and gazing at the public. <br><br>  What else will be implemented in the future?  We are thinking about media channels and websites where media resources can share their news and discuss them live.  A feature of such chat rooms will be the selection of news in the general stream.  In addition - photo chats, in which it will be possible to place only photos. <br><br>  There are many ideas, ChaTeam is developing rapidly and we are actively working on the systematics and chat functions and would like to receive feedback.  Which channel would you add?  What do you miss? <br><br>  In our next article we will take a closer look at the iOS application itself and tell you what it is and what it is. <br><br>  ChaTeam is a Russian instant messenger that focuses on thematic communication.  We hope that our ideology will allow including companies to more actively communicate with their customers, offer them help and communication on all issues.
