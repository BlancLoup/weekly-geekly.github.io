Events unfolded in the Spanish city of Figueres, where experts exhumed the body of the famous artist.  The interest in the personality of Dali has increased, but in order to get acquainted with the artist's work, it is not necessary to go to the gallery or the Internet.  Enough to go to the store to meet a work of art, familiar even to a small child. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In 1957, Enric Bernat became the head of the confectionary factory Granja Asturias.  The young man was not only a hereditary pastry chef, but also a competent businessman. <br>  Who likes sweets the most?  Children!  However, 60 years ago this fact did not seem so obvious.  Bernat paid for marketing research, which showed that most of the factory‚Äôs products are consumed by people under 16 years of age.  And while the younger generation enjoyed the taste of sweets, the elder remained unhappy.  Sweets that were of all colors and shapes attracted young researchers.  The children pulled candy out of their mouths, examined them.  And the sugar melted in the hands, leaving a sticky mark on the palms and clothes.  It was unhygienic and sloppy. <br>  Enric Bernat reflected.  No one gets his hands dirty when he eats with cutlery.  Why not try taking a lollipop with a fork?  So the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcandies was born in a new format - first on a wooden and later on a plastic stick.

      The owner of the factory made a bold decision and in 1958, having removed more than 200 types of confectionary goods from production, began to produce only one thing - candy with a pen. <br>  The original name was associative: ‚ÄúGoal‚Äù.  Round, like a ball.  The lollipop falls into the mouth like a football goal. <br><br>  But the advertising company dictated its rules.  The dynamic and explosive song from the commercial: "Chupa, chupa, chupa Chups", was quickly picked up by adults and children. <br>  The sticky motive gave the candy a name - Chupa with a consonant addition Chups.  It comes from "Chupar", which in Spanish means the verb "suck".  The company's first slogan was ‚Äú√âs rod√≥ i dura molt, Chupa Chups‚Äù, which is translated from Catalan as ‚ÄúIt is round and long.‚Äù <br>  After the renaming was over, the popular sweet needed a logo.  To solve this problem in 1961, Bernat turns to his compatriot - the scandalous surrealist Salvador Dali. <br><br>  Dali was not only an artist, as is commonly believed in wide circles.  He was involved in advertising: he acted in video clips, designed logos, and also drew scenery for theaters, worked in cinema.  It will take several decades before this type of activity will be called "designer" or "PR-manager." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c6d/e72/981/c6de729819ab4ff488d75bfde95af7ab.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Dali prepared the logo in an hour.  He painted the daisy of the correct form on a piece of newspaper and suggested writing the name of the candy inside the flower.  The use of the artist‚Äôs colors was inspired by the Spanish flag. <br><br>  The decision was important: to place the picture on top of the candy, and not on the side, as was done before.  So the form was not distorted by the folded wrapper, the name remained readable.  Chamomile replenished the ranks of successful "eternal logos", it looked bright and catchy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/132/bc8/417/132bc8417c4c4b1d80b0000d99d6361b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The logo has undergone a rebranding, in 1988, designers several times brightly circled a daisy, leaving the general concept of genius.  The inscription led to a single style. <br><br>  It is mistakenly thought that Dali did the job for free.  But the owner of the company complained that the corporate identity had cost a tidy sum.  But there was nothing to be sorry about: the bright design quickly paid for itself by recognizing and increasing sales. <br><br>  There are a lot of rumors and legends around Dali‚Äôs eccentric nature.  According to one of them, in addition to the monetary reward, the artist asked to send him a box with candy regularly.  Since then, the artist's favorite entertainment has been to come to the playground, open a lollipop, lick several times and throw it on the ground. <br><br>  Meanwhile, Chupa Chups expanded horizons.  Already in the late 60s, sweetness on a stick began to appear outside the country.  10 years later, the lollipops were known all over the world: USA, UK, Japan, Europe.  And in 1991, Chupa Chups opened an office in Russia, in the city of St. Petersburg.  The company, which began in a small confectionery, has grown into a corporation with an annual turnover of 400 million dollars.  And in 1995, Chupa Chups became the first candy that flew into space. <br><br>  By the end of the 20th century, the lollipop fell victim to the sexual revolution, causing ambiguous associations among people.  The creators of the advertising campaign of the company decided to satisfy the consumer and released a number of defiant and controversial advertising. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e4a/5ff/99b/e4a5ff99b8ab43f7a32a87f5abb1e2d4.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Advertising campaign Chupa-Chups 2002</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Slogan: The taste is so exciting that we recommend wearing a bra</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9e5/aed/877/9e5aed8773824ece9bb5783cddcb3c48.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Advertising campaign Chupa-Chups 2002</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Slogan: The only thing on a stick that should be licked.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d98/adf/d13/d98adfd1381047549ca72f16bd76f3c4.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Campaign sample 2004 from DDB Spain under the name ‚ÄúZasos‚Äù (Love bite).</i> <br><br>  You should not assume that the company decided to change the development vector: from sweets to non-childish fun.  Over the past decade, a really interesting ad has been released. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d4e/f52/f2d/d4ef52f2dc2047b695fe0b41443c060a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Or</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/2e9/678/8b9/2e96788b9ba3499b9a1c578425dae598.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>2005 Chupa-Chups Campaign</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Slogan: Chupa Chups Sugar Free</i> <i><br></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b08/3b9/51f/b083b951fb0840789fff3bc4919d9b6c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>2006 Chupa-Chups Advertising Campaign</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Slogan: so many fruits!</i> <br><br>  Here there was another case that linked the company with a celebrity.  The head coach of the football club Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãJohan Cruyff, was not on the list of stars advertising candies.  Faced with heart problems, he quit smoking.  Since 1993, fans have begun to notice that instead of a cigarette, the coach is constantly busy Chupa Chups.  Since then, sales of sweets in Spain have grown 7 times!  Since that moment, one of the most popular and large-scale actions of Chupa Chups has become - anti-tobacco. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/10b/52c/974/10b52c9744fa47148380abfc61dcf1bd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the end, a small interesting fact.  Every child at least once asked himself the question: why is there a hole in the stick of Chupa Chups?  In it whistled, used instead of tubes for juice, but, fortunately, very few people used for the purpose.  The popularity of sweets and a wide range of tastes led to the possibility of an accident.  Kids were so addicted to candy that they could swallow their wand.  The hole makes it possible to breathe while the doctors provide first aid. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c1a/a06/e31/c1aa06e31cb443bc9cbb9c8b662644eb.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <a href="http://www.advertology.ru/article118274.htm">A source</a> <br>  <i>How did the Chupa-Chups logo change?</i> <br><br>  The text was prepared by the copywriter Logmachina - Alena Kovalenko <br><br>  If you like to read about the history of the brand, take a look at our previous article: <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/logomachine/blog/334112/">The history of the brand Nike</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/334882/">https://habr.com/ru/post/334882/</a></p>
