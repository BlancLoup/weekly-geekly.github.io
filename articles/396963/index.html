  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to buy used iPhone</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Inspired by the numerous cases of sale of fakes or not fully working devices on the site Avito and others. <br><br>  So, you have found a suitable machine and are going to meet with the owner for a purchase.  Get ready for the fact that the test apparatus will be long, perhaps paid, but believe me, this is for your own good.  Let's get started <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The meeting is best held where you will have access to the Internet.  And reserve a spare SIM card with the ability to access the Internet and make a call.  This is a basic rule.  Another important condition is that it is best to arrange a meeting in the vicinity of any iPhone repair service (if the seller makes an appointment, then it is better to look at information on nearby services on the Internet).  Prepare 300-500 rubles for the diagnosis (you can get for free), but believe me, it will save you ten times more.  Therefore, the first thing we carry in service and let the master say that everything is in order inside.  Next, I will describe the parameters that need to be checked independently - after the service. <br><br><h3>  AppleID </h3><br>  This is one of the first things you should check out.  This parameter is located in the settings in the iCloud section.  The function "Find my phone" must be turned off, the fields with AppleID and password must be empty.  If they are filled out or the "Find my phone" feature is enabled, ask the owner to fix it.  If he refuses - it makes no sense to buy.  This is the future brick.  100%.  There are no services to unlock AppleID.  That is, no.  More precisely, there is one hacker (in Ecuador, sort of), but for one device it takes from $ 40 to $ 80, and there are restrictions on the version of iOS.

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"

        </script>
      <br>
    <h3>  TouchID </h3><br>  Fingerprint scanner.  You can also check it in the settings by entering your fingerprint and putting a simple password, for example, 1111. After that, lock the phone with the lock button and then check the scanner operation by unlocking the phone with your fingerprint.  Remember that the scanner works as follows - press the Home button, hold your finger a little bit on the button without pressure - the iPhone is unlocked.  No other actions should be requested.  If the TouchID does not work, then the price of the device should be significantly lower, because  repair will cost you a fortune, and the master still needs to be found - each fingerprint scanner is tightly tied to the processor's serial number, which makes it almost impossible to replace the button separately - only the entire motherboard with a button.  There may be services and there are, but really it will be extremely difficult to find a worker.  If the print scanner is not so important, then you can buy it with a broken one, but at the same time, the price of the device should still be reduced. <br><br><h3>  IMEI </h3><br>  Be sure to check the phone on the official Apple website.  Prepare in advance (find and open the page in the browser of your phone), so that at the meeting just enter the IMEI number on the site and get information.  You can display the IMEI number on the phone screen by dialing * # 06 #, you can also see it in the settings (Settings-Basic-About this device).  In the information from the Apple site, you can learn about the binding of the phone to AppleID, warranty periods and so on.  IMEI also needs to be checked with the one on the back cover of the phone or on the SIM card tray - if they are different, then the phone has at least someone else‚Äôs cover, which means it is 100% opened.  There are also several other services that will help you get information about your phone via IMEI (links below). <br><br><h3>  Cameras </h3><br>  Check the cameras for recording video with sound, slow-motion video, photo, photo with flash (I saw devices with which the camera shutter was triggered late and with flash it turned out just black photos).  Remember one thing - the camera on the iPhone does not slow down in the process!  If the brakes are visible in the camera, then most likely there is either a fake or an odd job in front of you.  Be sure to check the flash.  Take a photo with a flash, turn on the flashlight through the control center (brush the bottom-up on the desktop).  Cameras need to check both - record video with sound.  Thus one of the 3 iphone microphones is also checked.  The second microphone can be checked by running Siri - it listens for sound input from another microphone.  And the third - connect the phone to the handsfree - check the third microphone. <br><br><h3>  Calls and messages </h3><br>  Now the SIM card you have prepared is useful.  Call from your phone to buy and listen to how well the sound is transmitted.  If the sound is too low with a full volume indicator - most likely a problem with the speaker.  It can be solved easily enough, but this should reduce the cost of the phone, as you repair it.  Go to the messages and send any character from the phone you are buying.  SMS came - well, no - maybe problems with the modem.  Start FaceTime, check its work if possible.  Go to the settings and see if AppleID accounts for iMessage and FaceTime are not specified - if specified, the seller will have to delete them.  Insert the headphones and check the sound in them.  Do not buy a phone locked to the operator (when it is possible to use only with one operator).  First, the price of such a device is significantly lower (three times less than usual), and secondly, unlocking can be expensive.  In addition to blocking on the operator, there is also a blacklist.  Basically, these are phones with unpaid contracts.  This will work in the network of another operator, but there is a high probability that the phone can be blocked at any time - operators often exchange blacklist lists (some IMEI checkers show blocking). <br><br><h3>  Wifi performance </h3><br>  If you are in the subway, then connect to the free channel and launch a browser - you should be brought to the main subway page with the registration offer.  If not on the subway, then it is better to find a non-password network nearby or distribute wi-fi from your phone (if you have such a function). <br><br><h3>  Accelerometer </h3><br>  Turn on the effect of parallax in the wallpaper settings and check on the desktop.  Start the compass and check it by rotating the phone.  Also on the iPhone you can check the level (angle to the ground plane). <br><br><h3>  GPS, Glonass </h3><br>  Launch maps and check your location. <br><br><h3>  Screen check for reaction </h3><br>  The screen of the phone must respond to touch anywhere within the frame.  After checking, you can additionally start the game, like Subway Surfers, and check the speed of the screen's reaction to pressing.  At 6s / 6s + and above, also check the 3DTouch - the phone should determine the pressing force and, depending on the strength, give a different effect - open additional menus directly from the application icons.  Also turn on the white background (Notes) and then the dark background (the site in the browser) and check the screen for cracks and cocks under all viewing angles. <br><br><h3>  What else? </h3><br>  Check the phone's performance under load conditions: run the demanding application and let it work for a while.  At the same time check the heating of the phone.  If the phone shuts down on its own under load - discard the purchase.  Check with a slight touch of the screen if it is pushing.  If the phone was under repair and instead of the original screen, there is a Chinese copy - when pressed, a slight pushing will be felt.  This is because of the cheap glue that is used to glue the screen glass to the substrate.  Over time, this screen will come off.  You can also start the AppStore for verification - if PlayMarket or something else opens instead of it, there is a fake in front of you again.  The presence of documents to the phone (check from the store) and the box is a big plus, as this kit will help you if you already have your AppleID hacked.  The lack of a cable and a charging unit should also reduce the cost of the phone by at least 2,000 - it is this amount that will cost you buying new ones. <br><br>  Well, in the end, if all the points have satisfied you, and you are ready to buy, be sure to completely reset the phone through the settings (Settings-Basic-Reset-Erase content and settings).  The reset menu should have several (about 5-6) reset options - if there are 2-3, then you have a fake.  Also, if during the reset you ask something about a Google account, then this is also a fake.  After resetting the phone, there should not be a request for a password from any account - just an offer to create a new one or log in with an existing one (i.e., enter a new AppleID and password).  After resetting in the settings, check the model number - you just have to drive it into Yandex or Google and by the first links it will be clear what model you are in front of.  In general, be very careful, this is your money and in the case of cheating it will be insulting. <br><br>  Links to check the phone: <br>  <a href="https://www.icloud.com/activationlock/">www.icloud.com/activationlock</a> - check for AppleID blocking. <br>  <a href="https://checkcoverage.apple.com/ru/ru/">checkcoverage.apple.com/ru/ru</a> - check by serial number (can be found in the settings). <br>  More services for checking the phone by IMEI (for accuracy it is better to use several): <br>  <a href="http://www.iphoneox.info/">www.iphoneox.info</a> <br>  <a href="http://iphoneimei.info/">iphoneimei.info</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.imei.info/">www.imei.info</a> <br><br>  Special thanks for updating the publication: <b><a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/badun1/">badun1</a></b> ;  <b><a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/Aquahawk/">Aquahawk</a></b> <br><br>  Thanks for attention.  Adjustments (reasonable) are welcome! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396963/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396963/</a></p>
