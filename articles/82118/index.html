  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Serialomania. Problems of modern Russian television</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><br>  In less than 2 weeks on ABC channel, the 6th season of the most popular (at the moment) serial saga of the modern era, ‚ÄúLost‚Äù, will be aired.  With these four letters is associated a period of rising interest in the series in our country.  The biggest benefit that ‚ÄúLost‚Äù brought - our domestic audience has learned to distinguish soap from television shows.  If ‚ÄúMy Second Mother‚Äù is an example of a classic soap opera, then the ‚ÄúLost‚Äù mentioned earlier is something else.  At our television, the same concept of prime time (for television shows) is used quite rarely. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Russian TV shows are constantly, on all channels, capturing almost all of the airtime.  We can talk a lot about the quality of most of this production, but one thing is clear at the moment - we can do a lot of normal serials.  Moreover, the budgets allocated for serial building go into pockets and in the end the actors get some crumbs.  A series of top projects in the United States account for a budget of about 500 thousand dollars, we have several times less.  Another thing is that for the remaining money you can withdraw a quality product, but for this you need an adequate script.  There are such, but they, again, units.  For the most part, the product entering the Russian television market turns out to be stupid, dull and not gaming.  Written scripts are puzzling (how can you write such a thing?), Installation is depressing, and the habit of making 200-300 episodes on prime-time projects is carried out by the brain. <br><br>  No, we have adequate things that are filmed by the First Channel (or for the First Channel) and the Russia Channel.  In the year of standing television shows, no more than 5-6 come out, in their assets of 10-12 episodes.  Episodes are shown daily, not once a week, as it should be.  What for?  It's simple.  Good money is invested in the creation of such projects; with a daily show, at least a part of the production costs of the show fails, and as a result, we don‚Äôt see the continuation (or we see it, after 2-3 years).  As an example, the series, which was on the First Channel - "Special Forces".  Many could see him just 3-4 years ago.  The first season came out, then something similar to the second (a few episodes shorter than the first).  And then everything.  History, as usual, is not completed.  The viewer is waiting, the viewer asks (see the First Channel forum), but he is not given (offensively, yes?).  Now on the same Channel, there are some TV series "Wedding Ring" and "Next."  In the asset of the first - 150 episodes, in the asset of the second - already 200. Where?  What for?  Vaughn, NTV made a low-budget project "Wood grouse", which broke all imaginable records for ratings in Moscow.  All neat, 3 seasons, full-length (coming out in April).  Business works, the viewer is watching.  Show, of course, every day.  There's no way to go.

      To show once a week, our viewers need to be taught and this is, for the most part, the duty of TV channels.  True marketing policy and constant work with the audience can quite easily bear fruit.  So far, apparently, do not think about it.  How to draw the attention of our TV people to a similar situation?  Perhaps - in letters, perhaps - in protest actions.  In the United States, fans of the Jericho series, wanting to save any show from closing, conducted a small flashmob with the help of the postal service sent several tons of nuts to the CBS office, reminding the channel‚Äôs management of one replica of the series‚Äôs hero: ‚ÄúAre you nuts?‚Äù literally ‚Äúare you nuts?‚Äù).  And you know, it worked.  7 episodes of the 2nd season of the show were filmed.  After that, after all, the series was closed, but that's not the point.  If anyone is interested in a quality product, it‚Äôs the viewer.  As long as he does not show his interest, nothing will change. <br><br>  I will not call for anything, since, in fact, in my subjective opinion there has not yet been a single Russian series that would be very much liked.  Hope this is temporary.  I sincerely wish that after a year or two, our television began to make the viewer happy, otherwise there would simply be no consumer interest in special packages after the introduction of digital TV. <br><br>  In the meantime, as a small bonus and final twist, I suggest enjoying the very first foreign sitcom, which in our country was watched in almost every family.  "Duty pharmacy" Ten-minute of "Knife-vykiduhe." <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/nZUJyNA3qGA&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgD3fT9jIQa8JlLBpCFLIZkig3bKQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  ps and what do you think,% username%? <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/82118/">https://habr.com/ru/post/82118/</a></p>
