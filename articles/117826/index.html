Well, if this lucky man does not have simple phones, but smartphones, then he probably inherited a huge legacy.  Approximately the picture was perceived.  But quite a bit of time passed, in our everyday life almost nothing has changed, but the attitude to the second phones has changed radically.  Someone uses the ‚Äúsecond number‚Äù as a dialer, and on the main phone uses multimedia services.  Someone simply chooses from which number, how and where it will be more profitable to call.  And someone, deciding not to go broke on a 3G modem, and at the same time get a second phone, uses a handset connected to a computer, like a window into the big world.  In a word, there are a lot of applications for the second phones before our eyes. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Actually, this entire opus is dedicated to the fact that I have a second phone, the Nokia C5-03.  Having spent the last two years in the arms of Steve Jobs's products, I somehow fell behind the times, and I was not particularly interested in what was happening in the camp of other telephone manufacturers.  The news, of course, skipped, I was aware of both the Android and the success of HTC, but somehow I didn‚Äôt have to use the more or less modern products.  And then, by chance, I became the owner of the new Nokia C5-3 smartphone, having received it as a gift.  Before the transition to the apple camp, I used just Nokia products, so I received the phone with enthusiasm and a share of healthy curiosity. <br><br>  And so, having tormented the device for a week, I decided to describe my own impressions on Habr√©.  <i>This is my first blog post on Nokia, so I beg your indulgence if all of a sudden it doesn‚Äôt have to go to the courtyard or seems to the local leading light to be too personal.</i>  <i>I warn you in advance that this post does not in any way claim a full review, especially since there are plenty of them (reviews) on the network.</i>  <i>These are rather thoughts about the phone and how it appeared before me, who had already forgotten about Series 60 and other phone operating systems, except iOS.</i>  <i>I also do not plan to compare the C5-03 and iPhone, these are birds of different flight, and there is no sense in it.</i> <br><br>  The described phone is a branded version of the usual model from the MTS operator.  Differences from the original are expressed in the logo on the case, pre-installed interface topics and several services from MTS, including the rather useful ‚ÄúEasy Payment‚Äù service, when you can pay utility bills, the Internet and several other essential services from a phone bill.  Now it is actively advertised on TV, so there is no point in dwelling here.  The phone itself is compact, funky, milky, inexpensive.  Clearly designed for young people and sympathizers.  The work of the author, fortunately (and, perhaps, unfortunately) does not yet require a strict dress code, so the phone does not fall out of the general canvas of appearance.  I generally like bright things, if I were not the owner of two ‚Äústrict‚Äù laptops, home and work, I would have bought lettuce VAIO for a long time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/13a/e18/dc2/13ae18dc255156b360395be4fc2ab245.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Let's go back to the phone itself.  His body is plastic, pleasant to the touch, smooth.  Traces of prints are invisible.  On an inexperienced look, with plastic everything is all right.  Information about problems with plastic in Finnish phones reached me, but for now there is nothing to say about this, the phone is new and looks like.  In his hands, he lies tightly, the size seems to be optimal, larger smartphones are harder to hold in the palm of your hand.  In part, they redeem it with a larger display, but convenience in long conversations also means a lot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d84/320/c5d/d84320c5d605f8ccd08b142df8b41a80.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The display, in my opinion, is almost the most important thing in a modern phone.  Nokia C5-03 was pleasantly surprised here, in the sense that, knowing beforehand that the phone belongs to the budget line, I did not count on anything special.  The display on the phone is lively and bright, with a very decent resolution - some pre-installed games are designed for lower resolutions and look noticeably worse than a nicely drawn interface.  In general, it seems that the phone is better suited for web surfing, social networks and video, rather than for games and similar "children's" entertainment.  It is elongated, and it is convenient to read texts on it, or to view the tape on Facebook.  If you deploy the phone horizontally, it becomes more pleasant to read news sites like "Elephant". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0d9/175/be1/0d9175be12f243d507f480277b5943e1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The sensitivity of the display is average, occasional erroneous triggers occur.  But it is convenient that pressing is duplicated by vibration, the function is simple, but very useful.  The management is supplemented with three hardware buttons, reception-release and menu call.  The last action is completely unobvious and at first the phone baffles, you start to look for an access button on the screen, but you don‚Äôt have it, you need to press the ‚Äúreal‚Äù button. <br><br>  The built-in navigation also makes a good impression, this is important, since the phone may be used in the car.  As far as I understand, if you wish, the navigator in the phone can be ‚Äúfinished‚Äù, but out of the box it works well, at least in Moscow - routes are laid, speed is measured.  Most likely, as the appetites grow, opportunities will be lacking, but so far, out of the box, everything works quite well. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5b7/6da/30f/5b76da30fbecf7ef12ec05b662e31f31.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, for a snack - the Internet.  A little on this topic has been said above - the display is well suited for web surfing (as far as a display with such a diagonal can fit).  Mobile-optimized websites are best read in a vertical position, non-optimized - in a horizontal one.  3G works smartly, for MTS subscribers I give a tip to the fresh ‚ÄúEverything I need‚Äù package.  Details on the site, do not consider advertising.  The manager of wireless networks works well, the phone in this respect is tenacious, the Wi-Fi does not let go even through a couple of walls, if, for example, you want to read Bashorg in an office toilet. <br><br>  But this, as, in general, and other private impressions of a particular function, in my opinion, is not important.  The main surprise for the Nokia C5-03 mothballed on a single platform is the surprising fact that in just a couple of years, budget smartphones have gone so far.  They differ in price from top solutions in two or three times, but in fact they offer almost the same functionality.  Yes, the display is somewhere worse, plastic is less velvety, memory is less, but the very fact that such an inexpensive mass-produced typewriter is so overwhelming at first is puzzling whether the characteristics of the model are accurate and if there is any confusion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/04d/fa5/13b/04dfa513be02875e381248d684abbe10.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As a user, I have not yet decided whether to leave the C5-03 with a second phone for a long time - I will look at the benefits from calls at the tariffs of two operators (Megafon and MTS) and the overall frequency of use.  The device is generally quite flexible in terms of application.  The most advantageous scenario for me seems to be this: put a memory card more and make the phone "car", use it to play music through the on-board system and navigation.  This, of course, does not end the application of the device; everyone comes up with a phone with his own application.  This flexibility, in my opinion, is the main advantage of the model.  Well, the low price, of course, plays an important role. <br>  As a dessert, I place several snapshots of the phone ‚Äúin the interior‚Äù.  I would be happy to comment on the text and the device itself, until recently it was practically impossible to write about phones. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117826/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117826/</a></p>
