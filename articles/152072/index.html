Or maybe your website visitors just do not trust you? <br><br>  Several years ago, the high cost of delivery was the main factor deterring customers from shopping online.  Now the main factor is risk. <br><br>  The spread of phishing attacks, viruses, and simply poor-quality service make buyers hesitate for longer before putting the product in the cart - this means that the level of trust in your site is more important than ever.  Below are six ways you can use to prevent fear of risk from your customers and to create more trusting conditions for their purchases. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  1. Introduce yourself </h4><br>  People do not trust electronic pages or websites.  People trust people.  Therefore, it is important for them whether the ‚Äúhuman factor‚Äù is on your site.  One way or the other, you should show your potential buyers the faces and names of the employees.  Use the ‚ÄúAbout Us‚Äù page to present information not only about your company, but also to publish a message from the creator or president (of course, with the attached photo) or the ‚ÄúGet to know our team‚Äù section (with photos and names) - or use both . <br><br>  And, if possible, add a personal touch to the information that you post on other pages.  Bookseller Chapters Indigo made its distinctive feature that the products from the Heather Peak section were under the special label "especially loved and popular in our company."  You can do something similar on your website or ask a significant person to represent the hit of the day or the top purchase of the week.  All this, of course, must be specifically announced on the store's website or in the electronic mailing list and so on. <br><br><h4>  2. Look professional </h4><br>  Show that you are a ‚Äúreal‚Äù company, with all the components that a real company should have, such as: <br><br><ul><li>  easy way to communicate with the manual (well-designed contact page, not just a letter form) </li><li>  customer service (a separate page with information that fully and thoroughly regulates the customer service procedure, including the problem of returning goods and the FAQ section). </li></ul><br><br>  These pages do not have to be large, but they should be easy to use and provide all the important information that your customers can search for.  Remember, the more informative your FAQ page is, the more confident an online shopper feels when purchasing your products. <br><br><h4>  3. Show that others trust you. </h4><br>  ‚ÄúWhat others say about you and your product, or service, or business as a whole is at least a thousand times more convincing than what you say, even if you sound two thousand times better,‚Äù says marketing guru Dan Kennedy from the GKIC (Glazer-Kennedy Insider's Circle).  Therefore, you need to make sure that you have drawn enough attention to customer feedback.  Text recommendations are important, but today in the era of the reign of YouTube, social networks and services, the recommendations there have even more weight. <br><br>  Another way to ‚Äúprove‚Äù that other people trust your company is to display positive press reviews about your product in the ‚ÄúNews‚Äù section.  If your company managed to ‚Äúlight up‚Äù in a well-known publication, confirm the accuracy of this information by displaying the logos of well-known media brands, where there are references to your product or store.  You may notice that on the pages of many successful stores customer reviews are displayed, and displayed so that they can be clearly seen, and this is another good idea that you can take note of. <br><br><h4>  4. Prove your website is secure. </h4><br>  Online buyers today are very smart, they have already trained to look for an additional ‚Äús‚Äù in the address bar of their browser and the ‚Äúlock‚Äù symbol, which will tell them that the website is securely protected - this is now a prerequisite for the e-commerce site. <br><br>  Websites protect their servers using Secure Socket Layer (SSL), a standard security protocol that encrypts information between the server and the browser.  To do this, the web server needs an SSL certificate.  Any worthwhile e-commerce solution with a full set of features will provide you with the SSL certificate you need to show your customers that it is safe to purchase goods from you. <br><br>  If your site does not automatically display an ad that your site is safe to use, you had better display your SSL certificate or at least just publish information that it exists. <br><br><h4>  5. Eliminate surprises </h4><br>  Think of your site from the perspective of a potential buyer.  What is the biggest risk?  The risk that they will not like the product - and then they will not be able to get their money back.  Therefore, increase the reliability of your site (and the chances that you will buy something will increase), telling customers about the delivery and return policy.  For example, the shipping and returning pages on the websites of most successful online stores inform customers that delivery of orders over N $ is free, and goods are subject to exchange or return within M days from the date of order, and most importantly, the order of implementation these procedures. <br><br>  It is also necessary to inform the buyer of additional taxes and fees, and it is better to completely exclude them from the pricing policy, anticipating potential fears of buyers that they will require an additional delivery charge, in addition to the price of the product.  All this information should be easily accessible on the website of the online store, convincing customers that the risk when buying on this site is minimal. <br><br><h4>  6. Position yourself at the expense of partners. </h4><br>  If you use the services of well-known delivery services or payment systems, be sure to inform your customers about this.  It would also be nice to get any feedback from them about your store.  If your online store is made in a famous studio, their review of your company will not hurt either.  If you cooperate with banks or other financial organizations in the field of customer lending or acquiring, be sure to report this to your customers by placing the logos of partner brands on the pages of your online store.  Remember, the more partners you have, the more you are trusted. <br><br>  When customers first get acquainted with your site, they think exactly the same thing as when they walk through the usual unfamiliar store - look around, evaluate the place and decide whether they will trust him enough to get something.  If you want them to buy something on your website, you need to instill in them the confidence that you can be trusted. <br><br>  Link to the original article: <a href="http://www.shopify.com/blog/6532021-6-tips-to-develop-an-ecommerce-pricing-strategy">www.shopify.com/blog/6532021-6-tips-to-develop-an-ecommerce-pricing-strategy</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/152072/">https://habr.com/ru/post/152072/</a></p>
