  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Web studios and freelance teams - start-ups? (trying to figure it out)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, the number of questions revolving around the same topic has increased. <ul><li>  From acquaintances working in business: ‚ÄúI have an idea for a new project, could you recommend me a team that wanted to and could be engaged in this project?‚Äù </li><li>  From the <a href="http://startupweekend.ru/">Weekend</a> participants: ‚ÄúWe would like to do such and such a project, but we are not the developers ourselves - could you advise whom to turn to?‚Äù </li><li>  From web studios: ‚ÄúWe work here, we make websites for customers, but for this work we receive money once and that‚Äôs it.  We could make the same efforts to create a startup.  If he shoots, it will be more interesting for us.  How could we cooperate? ‚Äù </li><li>  From freelancers: ‚ÄúYes, we are already doing what we like.  But I want to do something promising, however, we still do not have our own ideas.  And past you run all sorts of startups that need fast and high-quality development.  How could we participate? ‚Äù </li></ul>  Accordingly, the topic can be formulated as follows.  On the one hand, there are non-developers with ideas, on the other hand, teams of qualified developers.  And there are incomprehensible things for me so far ... <a name="habracut"></a><ol><li>  Can the authors of ideas and teams agree on mutually acceptable terms in this case? <ul><li>  What can be the conditions of participation in the project for authors and developers?  There may be a conflict due to the fact that each of the parties will assume that its contribution to the project is greater than that of the partner.  This conflict can occur immediately.  To make matters worse, it can manifest itself at the moment when an investor with real money looms on the horizon. </li><li>  How much will the developers be able to devote enough time to participate in this project?  How much will their current clients and the need to earn current money interfere with the planned work on a startup? </li><li>  How big are the risks that the development team will use the results and developments in their work that is not related to the startup?  As an extreme option: how big are the risks that the development team will simply launch its similar project created on the basis of these developments? </li></ul></li><li>  Will such a tandem be interesting for future investors who can invest in the resulting project? <ul><li>  Investors constantly claim that they invest not in the idea, but in the team. </li><li>  Are they ready to consider a web studio or a team of freelancers entirely as project participants, given that it is real (permanent) to work on this startup only part of the company's employees (team members)? </li><li>  Will they strive to divide the share of developers in the project into two parts: 1) the web studio as a ‚Äúseed investor‚Äù of the project and 2) the future team of the project itself - the developers who will work further in the project? </li><li>  To what extent is the situation acceptable for a web studio (freelance team) in which some employees in the future can go into a separate project?  And will it not cause a desire to allocate people to a startup by the residual principle, that is, not ‚Äústars‚Äù who would be sorry to lose, but exactly the opposite? </li></ul></li></ol>  First of all, I would like to understand the position of web studios and freelance teams in relation to the problem I described.  Do such teams have a desire to participate in startups?  What conditions would they be willing to consider?  What other questions arise? <br><br>  You can discuss questions in the comments, but I would like to ask representatives of web studios and freelance teams <a href="http://datalite.ru/Qstn/Question.aspx%3FQstListKey%3DHabrQuestion01">to take part in a short survey</a> , the results of which I will share here on Habr√© after its completion. <br><br>  We will deal with the position of investors later - if it turns out that teams have a fundamental interest. </div>
