It so happened - the development of visual effects is my hobby, but it brings me the most money and a lot of fun is cool. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/df/g6/-n/dfg6-novqpxewe2i5omjizgrjhi.jpeg"></div><br><blockquote>  If someone in the game needs an awesome explosion, they come to me, need an optimization of the effect, here I am again, do you need to burn everything to hell in the virtual space and put lightning on the surviving unfortunate? </blockquote><br>  <i>And we will touch on the issue of realism effects, but very superficially ...</i> <br><br>  <i><b>Disclaimer</b> - the article does not carry heavy semantic load and is intended to ignite fire in the hearts of pixel pyromans.</i>  <i>Is a sick fantasy of the author, who did not make any effect and writes nonsense) &lt;sarcasm</i>

      <b>WELCOME</b> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Okay, since you are also fans of pixel blasting, let's look at where such talents are needed. <br><br><h3>  Video editing (advertising and blogs) </h3><br>  Mount your videos with cool explosions, if you can blow something up then why hold back? <br>  Beat the viewer on the forehead with lightning, everyone loves the beautiful, especially if they are in place. <br>  Well, advertising, of course, simulations of the fall of ice cubes in water and other beauty. <br><br><h3>  Film industry </h3><br>  No, well, have you seen?  There are cool VFX in Marvel films, but look at Tom Cruise‚Äôs last mission, everything is done in Houdini, smoke and fire in Pyro FX, how Hunt knocks a car and he flies head over heels too, and also the stones for which the hook of the helicopter caught.  If Tom Cruise‚Äôs pirouettes are not very easy for an unprepared person, everyone can start burning and in just a couple of months.  Provided 2 hands with 10 fingers, heads with working hemispheres and of course motivation. <br><blockquote>  And yes, the effects there are not very good and are made in a hurry, are not entered into the environment, and photorealism is lost from this and the prepared eye sees the difference.  But the mass viewer may not notice the trick, but still he does not like it and he does not understand exactly what. <br></blockquote><br><h3>  Gamedev </h3><br>  Favorite topic, the author throws his fireballs precisely in this area.  If in the video you just need to adjust the effect according to the frame and set perspective plus light <i>(well, of course it‚Äôs very simple, like two fingers, just like that, aha) &lt;sarcasm</i> Then in the gaming industry there are different questions: <br><br><ul><li>  in what form it is to withdraw and how to implement in the project </li><li>  how to achieve cool optimization with a good visual </li><li>  what tools will help us improve the result and complement it </li><li>  How to fit the effect into the environment / do I need several versions of the effect for the environment </li></ul><br><blockquote>  It is clear to enter the effects in the environment is aerobatics.  How?  Fundamental knowledge of the basics, that is what distinguishes the master from others.  Light, composition, physical properties, and more. </blockquote><br><h3>  Why do we add physics here? </h3><br>  Suppose there is an explosion, an explosion of a mine or a grenade, has anyone seen this phenomenon?  Is there a lot of fire? <br>  There is not a lot, but turn on any FPS and the screen starts melting from the effects.  This is due to the entertainment, often an ordinary explosion is not so spectacular as to cause the player to salivate profusely.  Here, as with the increase in the chest or fifth point of the heroines of computer games, this is the selling point.  Yes, there are basic principles, imitation of the initial movement or propagation of particles, but only imitation and very much embellished.  In addition, now there are a lot of stylized effects and very few people make realism.  The problem is that any physically plausible effect needs to be embellished / changed color / added to luminescence or dynamics, to slow down some and speed up other moments, in a word - to refine.  Knowledge of physics will help to do cool, but the real world does not have the gloss that is needed in the virtual, so the next point. <br><br><h3>  Cool effects - selling point for your game </h3><br>  This can be denied, it is possible to argue with this, but just so in practice.  Steep and juicy explosions, impacts, lightning - this is one of the selling points of your game.  I see a cool action, an X-ray of the attack and a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãblood - give two.  Mortal combat.  What about Subnautica?  Pseudo rays under the surface of the water, bubbles, fire, reflections on the water, well, who might not like this?  Especially important are the effects in the MMO; see, for example, Black Desert, the grindil grindilkoy, but thousands of hours spent in the boaters do not tire, of course, the boater itself is beautiful, but the effects complement it and make it more pleasant for the eyes.  Okay, last argument in favor of effects.  Doom Eternal, have you seen the latest gameplay video?  Dumgay just cuts the enemies into pieces, tears off pieces of armor, everywhere lumps, plasma clots, boom, crash, KABUUM! <br><br><h3>  Our tools: </h3><br>  Particle systems in engines (Unity and Unreal) and runtime <br><br>  Programs for creating and rendering: <br><br>  AE <br>  Spine <br>  Houdini <br>  Fume fx <br><br>  The meaning of the article is to say - <b>everyone can blow up the pixels, it is important desire and perseverance.</b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gn/rq/hx/gnrqhxonvntz0xmafejalw1tdpg.jpeg"></div><br>  And the most popular effects are stylized, of course there is a great demand for hyper-realistic explosions with complex shaders, collisions and other scary things, but the world is changing.  Cute and simple, bright and recognizable effects are the face of the game and today it is casual / stylized and it is easy to learn how to create such VFXs and start a career in game development. <br><br><blockquote>  Rantaym or render?  More in detail in the next article. </blockquote><br>  An example of working with <b>pyro FX</b> in Houdini with a default shader and 3 pumping on nodes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ac/jj/6z/acjj6zzbsrj9mmibqgqyw-ts9b8.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/445892/">https://habr.com/ru/post/445892/</a></p>
