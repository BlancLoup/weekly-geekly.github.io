And to talk about the most difficult and most incomprehensible - the indications for their removal. <br><br>  Since ancient times, there are a lot of jokes, superstitions, legends and stories, including very scary ones, associated with eights (third molars or ‚Äúwisdom teeth‚Äù).  And all this mythology is spread not only among ordinary people, but also in the medical community.  Gradually, during the discussion, I will try to debunk them and show that wisdom teeth are not such a problem, both in terms of diagnosis and in terms of removal.  Especially, if we are talking about a modern doctor and a modern clinic. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l3/ao/so/l3aoso0oows1qrcyof0v5y4xshs.jpeg" alt="image">

    <h4>  Why are wisdom teeth so called? </h4><br>  Everything is very simple.  Eighth teeth tend to erupt between the ages of 16 and 25 years.  At a conscious age, rather late in comparison with the rest of the teeth.  Like, become so wise?  Get wisdom teeth in the form of bite problems and pericoronaritis - on!  Yes, sometimes a person‚Äôs wisdom begins with the pain and suffering associated with wisdom teeth.  No pain no gain, as they say. <br><br><h4>  Why do wisdom teeth erupt from someone, and someone not? </h4><br>  Because someone is wise, but someone is not very.  Joke. <br><br>  To begin with, it should be clarified that the overwhelming majority of people have wisdom teeth, and their absence from birth is very, very rare.  To be born without wisdom teeth and their rudiments is how to win the jackpot - urgently buy a lottery ticket, because you are a lucky person. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fe/tt/kx/fettkxi4sypi0ie0pofhc-mgbky.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  But eights are far from being cut at all.  And it depends on the state of the bite.  Or rather, the presence of space in the jaw for their eruption. <br><br>  It so happened that they begin to grow in the period when the active growth of the jaw bones slows down, and the dentition, it seems, is already ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù.  The tooth grows up (or down, if on the upper jaw), stumbles upon an obstacle in the form of a seven that has already erupted, stops or starts turning. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tj/j9/w9/tjj9w9scoplbr46nqnzkoiv-ely.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  This is how not only impacted (impassable), but also abnormally located (distorted) eights are obtained. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mr/g_/et/mrg_ets2z8zzhe0uovs95kfpslw.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  In fairness, it should be noted that wisdom teeth can be more than four.  Occasionally there are not only the "eight", but also the "nine" or even "tens."  Of course, such an assortment in the oral cavity does not lead to anything good. <br><br><h4>  If there are eight, then it is for some reason needed? </h4><br>  Well, most people have a navel.  And he, obviously, is also intended for something.  For example, for storing wool pellets and other materials for applied arts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oi/4o/-b/oi4o-bah3y90c2w1jf7jzgap0hg.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Speaking seriously, the G8 is a kind of atavism.  A reminder that millions of years ago, our ancestors ate raw meat, mammoths and other living creatures, and even vegans were much more brutal, instead of celery they ate bark of baobab. <br><br>  In this regard, the jaws of our ancestors were much larger and wider, and even Nikolai Valuev would look slightly feminine in their background.  And all thirty-two teeth in such jaws were placed remarkably, everyone was happy. <br><br>  However, in the process of evolution, people became more intelligent, learned to process food, fry meat and stew <s>baobab</s> broccoli.  The need for large jaws and a massive chewing apparatus is no longer necessary, people have become more graceful and glamorous.  Their chewing muscles and jaws too.  But the number of teeth has not changed.  And sometimes they just don't fit in glamor jaws.  And the one who is the last gets to <s>be a dad a</s> position of retention or dystopia. <br><br>  So the eights have become "unnecessary" teeth.  And, probably, it would be more correct to call them not ‚Äúwisdom teeth‚Äù, but ‚ÄúAustralopithecus teeth‚Äù - you see, and people will start to treat them more adequately. <br><br><h4>  What are the eight? </h4><br>  You will not believe, but, basically, the eight are the eighth in a row. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pq/nb/st/pqnbstzko8b3ru8hw54yeg-ebza.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  What happens if you don‚Äôt bother with wisdom teeth at all? </h4><br>  If the eights are cut through, are in the bite and function normally, then of course nothing will happen.  It is enough to carefully monitor the hygiene in their area, because with it there can be some difficulties due to the gag reflex and poor visibility, periodically shown to the dentist - and the rules.  Such wisdom teeth will exist happily ever after. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zg/tv/dt/zgtvdtw2eysmvrceracgzs0zicw.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  With dystopic wisdom teeth, everything seems to be also understandable - because of their location, oral hygiene is hampered, and these teeth are quickly affected by caries.  It can be worse if caries spreads to neighboring sevens, which, unlike the eights, are functionally very important.  Often caries appears on the most distant and poorly visible surface of the tooth.  And a person notices him only when the whole thing starts to hurt.  That is too late. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jx/t2/cp/jxt2cpyqqcx5e89hkkpgpr6_hyo.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition, abnormally located wisdom teeth create in the bite of the so-called.  ‚ÄúTraumatic knots‚Äù violate the usual reflex connections, which leads to problems with the musculo-articular masticatory apparatus.  Subsequently, this is aggravated by bite pathology, overstrain of the masticatory muscles, and a crunch in the temporomandibular joints, i.e., there are signs of muscular-articular dysfunction.  And, as a rule, the treatment of such musculo-articular dysfunctions begins with the study of the role of the eighth teeth in this pathology and the adoption of the necessary measures (that is, removal). <br><br>  It is more difficult to understand what happens with the impacted wisdom teeth.  It would seem that the tooth is not visible, there is almost no risk of caries, he would sit by himself and sit ... However, there are a number of unpleasant consequences. <br><br>  Despite the fact that the tooth has not erupted yet, it already affects the dentition.  It can cause the movement of teeth and the formation of crowding in the front section: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ce/xi/pm/cexipmeksfod3vvtcj89pcsbm5a.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Due to the absence of a bone septum between the holes of the seventh and eighth teeth, a deep pocket is formed between them, which can get food debris, plaque and microbes, which leads to inflammation.  Sometimes quite acute and dangerous to health. <br><br>  The very process of eruption of impacted teeth, especially those aged 20 years and older, is often accompanied by inflammation - pericoronaritis. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zr/i2/mx/zri2mxlgblsj0ptce2v7oyt1hsi.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sn/v5/_x/snv5_xddpwxte-mzcklhgezohgo.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Treatment of pericoronaritis is a separate topic.  Somehow we will discuss it, but now you need to know the main thing - it‚Äôs better not to bring up pericoronaritis, and if it‚Äôs clear that there‚Äôs not enough wisdom teeth and their eruption will be difficult, it‚Äôs better to remove them in advance. <br><br>  But the most unpleasant thing you can expect from wounded teeth that are impacted is cysts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/me/pb/hq/mepbhqmqbmqeglvsrekiktqyy08.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Their source is the follicle, surrounding the tooth germ.  When a tooth erupts, the follicle disappears, but in the case of retention it persists and can serve as a source of tumors and cysts. <br><br>  Sometimes - quite large and very dangerous to health. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rj/j7/yh/rjj7yhy6vvgk6d99wiinr5rusv0.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  And although all this is quite a treatment for yourself, agree that it is better not to bring yourself to such a state. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/om/hw/ym/omhwym9_jtmllaksgqvlzzp_pdu.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Why are the opinions of doctors about the removal of wisdom teeth so contradictory? </h4><br>  Basically, it all comes down to the doctor‚Äôs experience in removing wisdom teeth.  If the procedure itself is given to the doctor hard, takes a lot of time and brings only suffering to the patient, then he is mostly opposed to removal.  And on the contrary, if the removal of 8s, even the most complex ones, does not present serious difficulties for the doctor, then on the contrary, he is in favor of a final and radical solution - the removal operation. <br><br><h4>  When the penalty can not be pardoned to remove can not be left? </h4><br>  Meanwhile, the criteria for the removal / removal of wisdom teeth is very simple.  All of them can be reduced to one simple phrase: <br><br>  Diseases and complications associated with wisdom teeth, or the threats of these very diseases and complications are indications for the removal of wisdom teeth. <br><br>  Everything.  There are no other indications / contraindications. <br><br>  Consider the examples: <br><br><ol><li>  Normal, cut through and fully functioning in the normal occlusion is not necessary to remove.  Moreover, in the case of caries, such teeth can (and should) be treated.  The situation is different if caries is complicated by pulpitis or periodontitis - in such cases it makes sense to think, because the treatment of root canals in third molars presents certain difficulties.  Maybe you do not need to bother with the channels? </li><li>  Abnormally located (distal) wisdom tooth.  He did not have enough space and he either leaned in some direction or remained half in the gum.  Such a tooth will never function, but it creates problems both for the bite and for the adjacent teeth.  Do I need to delete it?  Of course. </li><li>  A impacted wisdom tooth.  It seems like it does not bother.  It is located somewhere far away.  Does not participate in chewing and will never participate.  We can already see what the retired figure eight can lead to.  Does it make sense to wait for these complications?  I think not, it does not. </li><li>  The tooth began to erupt, the gums inflamed over it.  Pericoronitis, which is the name of this disease, is a sign that the tooth does not have enough space in the jaw and, as a result, it will either turn out to be dystopic, or it will lead to the displacement of teeth and a violation of bite.  Should I treat pericoronaritis with a simple excision of the hood?  Hardly.  It is better to solve this problem radically, namely, by removing the problem tooth. </li></ol><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  From the above, we can conclude that the removal of wisdom teeth most often occurs when the patient is not particularly concerned about the patient.  That is, this procedure is the prevention of possible complications on the part of g-8s.  This is right.  There is no method more effective and cheaper than prevention.  And the best medicine is preventive medicine. <br><br>  Next time I will tell you about how, in fact, there is the removal of wisdom teeth, how to prepare for this procedure and what to do after it. <br><br>  Thanks for attention!  Do not switch! <br><br>  Sincerely, Andrei Dashkov. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/455286/">https://habr.com/ru/post/455286/</a></p>
