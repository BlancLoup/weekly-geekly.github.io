      Starting your acquaintance with English literature is better from simpler books with elementary vocabulary and simple grammar.  We have collected for you a collection of interesting books that even a novice with an elementary level of knowledge will understand without any problems. <br><br>  Take and read! <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Adventures of Tom Sawyer <br>  Mark twain </h3><br>  <i>Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Mark Twain</i> <br><br>  An exciting story about childhood, friendship and pranks, which is included in the school curriculum in more than 40 countries of the world. <br><br>  Despite the fact that the book is written for children, it will be nice to read and adult.  The vocabulary of the work is quite simple and clear - it is designed for very young readers, so the story can and should be read even by those who began to learn English just a few months ago. <br><br><h3>  Treasure island <br>  Robert Louis Stevenson </h3><br>  <i>Treasure Island</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Robert Lewis Stevenson</i> <br><br>  Excellent pirate story, which read boys of primary and secondary school age.  Will the protagonist find the treasure of Captain Flint himself and will he be able to maintain friendship in the face of great wealth?  Read and learn. <br><br>  The book is widely used nautical terms - they will have to look in the dictionary.  But in general, the grammar and vocabulary of the narrative is quite simple and understandable. <br><br>  We especially recommend the book to men who want to feel the spirit of adventure from childhood again. <br><br><h3>  Alice in wonderland <br>  Lewis carroll </h3><br>  <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Lewis Carroll</i> <br><br>  On the one hand, this is a children's colorful book that takes the reader to the world of fairy tales and fantasies.  But if one perceives it from the point of view of an adult, the dialogues and events receive new meanings and amaze with their depth. <br><br>  Phrases are filled with ambiguities and play on words, but at the same time they remain quite understandable for perception even for beginners in the English language.  Looking for similar ambiguities in character dialogues is a special pleasure.  But be prepared that some phrases will have to look in the dictionary. <br><br><h3>  Robinson crusoe <br>  Daniel Defoe </h3><br>  <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Daniel Defoe</i> <br><br>  The story of a man who lived 28 years on a desert island.  A story about survival, difficulties and loneliness.  The book has a lot of reflections, descriptions of the environment and the actions of the main character, so the vocabulary is quite accessible. <br><br>  The action in the book often revolves around simple things - for example, how Robinson makes a table or cares for sprouted grain.  Therefore, the work is mandatory for those who are starting to learn English to read. <br><br><h3>  Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone <br>  Joanne rowling </h3><br>  <i>Harry potter and the philosopher's stone</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Joanne Rowling</i> <br><br>  The first book in the Harry Potter series is a story about children's friendship, courage in the face of danger and responsibility. <br><br>  We recommend starting with the first part of the series, because it is written in simpler English.  In the subsequent Harry Potter books, the language ‚Äúmatures‚Äù, it becomes deeper and more multifaceted, the childlike spontaneity disappears in it and the emotional experiences of the characters appear. <br><br>  The original book is written by British English, but there is an adapted version for the American reader (Harry Potter and Sorcerer's Stone).  Choose the one that is more suitable for your curriculum - and forward to the world of magic. <br><br><h3>  The hound of the baskervilles <br>  Arthur conan doyle </h3><br>  <i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Arthur Conan Doyle</i> <br><br>  Classic English detective with unsurpassed detective Sherlock Holmes in the lead role.  This is a must-have for every lover of the genre. <br><br>  The mystery of the old manor, the raid of mysticism and the brilliant deductive method of Mr. Holmes - this book has everything to captivate you for a long time. <br><br>  The book is written in classic British language, but at the same time it is quite simple for perception.  Of course, there are moments in which you will need a dictionary - they mainly concern the artsy manner of speech of secondary characters.  But overall this is a great book for language training and learning classic British English. <br><br><h3>  Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy <br>  Douglas adams </h3><br>  <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Douglas Adams</i> <br><br>  This is one of the most cited works on the space theme.  A fascinating book that tells about the life of the last living representative of the race of earthlings.  And of course, in it you will know the answer to the main question about life, the universe and all that. <br><br>  In this series of books there is a large number of technical vocabulary, so you first have to arm yourself with a dictionary.  But because of the simplicity of grammatical constructions, the book is read very easily. <br><br>  Humor is a completely separate part of the book.  Already because of him it is worth reading in the original. <br><br><h3>  Dracula <br>  Bram stoker </h3><br>  <i>Dracula</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Bram Stoker</i> <br><br>  Classic vampire romance in the Gothic style, which received dozens of screen versions and millions of fans.  This book is the ancestor of the genre. <br><br>  The book is written in English of the XIX century, so at first it will be difficult to perceive it - there are archaisms and outdated phrases.  But if you master the first 50 pages and get used to the style of presentation, reading will be much easier.  Be mentally prepared, that at first you will have to use a dictionary quite often, but to be honest - it's worth it. <br><br><h3>  Forrest gump <br>  John Escott </h3><br>  <i>Forrest Gump</i> <i><br></i>  <i>John ascot</i> <br><br>  The touching story of a mentally retarded person who is able to change the fate of other people.  Most people know her from the same film, in which the lead role played by Tom Hanks.  But in the book, the character of the characters is revealed even more deeply. <br><br>  The language is very simple to understand, because the book is written on behalf of the Forest itself.  At the same time, deep philosophical thoughts lie behind the ostentatious simplicity. <br><br>  We highly recommend reading - regardless of the level of your English. <br><br><h3>  1984 <br>  George orwell </h3><br>  <i>1984</i> <i><br></i>  <i>George Orwell</i> <br><br>  Legendary dystopia, in which one of the possible options for the development of states on earth.  One of the most absurd options, which for some reason has a lot in common with the existing system. <br><br>  This is a book about the worst manifestations of power and forbidden free-thinking.  Vocabulary is available here, but the structure of the sentences may cause difficulties for beginners.  On the other hand, you will see a variety of grammatical constructions in ‚Äúlive sound‚Äù. <br><br>  If the complexity and deep meaning of the work do not frighten you - then this book is a must-read. <br><br>  In fact, there are a great many books in English that can be mastered even by a student with elementary level knowledge.  This selection is quite subjective, but here are collected classics from various genres of literature, which are well perceived and even incredibly interesting. <br><br>  Read, enjoy and improve your English with pleasure! <br><br><h3>  EnglishDom.com is an online English learning platform. </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nn/ot/gc/nnotgcd65qtqsly4cxyp060wij8.png"><br><br>  Do not forget to reinforce the reading conversational practice! <br><br>  Leave a <a href="https://www.englishdom.com/%3Futm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_source%3Dhabra%26utm_campaign%3D10booksforbeginners">request for a free introductory lesson</a> on Skype until 12/31/18 and receive when you first pay with the promotional code <a href="https://www.englishdom.com/prices/goodhabr2/%3Futm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_source%3Dhabra%26utm_campaign%3D10booksforbeginners">goodhabr2</a> +2 lessons as a gift. <br><br>  And if you prefer to learn the language yourself, try our online course; follow the <a href="https://www.englishdom.com/prices/habronline2/%3Futm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_source%3Dhabra%26utm_campaign%3D10booksforbeginners">link</a> - 2 months of subscribing to all courses for free. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/426047/">https://habr.com/ru/post/426047/</a></p>
