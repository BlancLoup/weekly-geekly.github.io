I decided to post it to the blog. <br>  Necessity in the order of the collection of musical files I saw for a long time. <br>  A lot of unwritten tags, heaps of unparsed music - all this was depressing.  Yes, besides, Iphone was recently acquired.  And its beautiful coverflow without those most cover (in combination with album art) is a horror ugly and indecent.  If on Nokia I somehow got along with it - I went to ‚Äúall the songs‚Äù and searched for the right search, then Jobs himself ordered the Iphone to clean up. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So.  What do I need (for order and beauty): <br>  1. Main tags are prescribed, such as: <br>  - The name of the song (including all kinds of ‚Äúfeat.‚Äù, ‚ÄúVs‚Äù, ‚ÄúNNN cover‚Äù and others) <br>  - Artist (besides, so that the statistics are not violated and the choice of artist has worked) <br>  - Track number (in 0x format, not only because of my aesthetic considerations, see below) <br>  - Compilations and sound tracks are correctly processed (that is, each track has a performer of the song itself, the name of the song, but the whole album - a compilation - must be searched for the albums as a whole) <br>  - Album cover (the same cover, album art) <br>  2. To tag the artist, song and album name was correct (Unicode, as well as - so that it should be what it should be - considering the register, umlauts and other tricks of the names). <br>  3. The file name is not critical, but the track numbers in it must be in 0x format (so that the names like ‚Äù1 Track 1.mp3‚Äù and ‚Äú10 Track 11.mp3‚Äù did not stand side by side, and all the tracks were in order - like in the album - 01 Intro.mp3, 02 Start.mp3, etc.).  I also love the decomposed by artists, albums (over the years of release) media library: <br>  .. \ <br>  Executor\ <br>  2009 Album \ <br>  01 Intro.mp3 <br>  02 Start.mp3 <br>  ... <br>  19 Outro.mp3 <br>  That is, in order to look at its order and harmony, it was possible not only through the player program (or catalog), the device itself (iPhone, Nokia, or some other Sony Ericsson), but through an ordinary file manager everything would be nice and ordered.  And the unordered and unknown, let it lie in the folders "unknown" ... <br>  In my opinion, it is quite logical. <br>  So.  What do I want from the program that will help me in putting in order? <br>  1. To register all tags at once for an album. <br>  2. Rename all files structured. <br>  3. Download cover (album art) - put them in a tag and (if you can, put folder.jpg in a folder). <br>  4. Ability to download tags automatically (with freedb.org, cddb, musicbrainz.org, last.fm, discogs, tracktype.org, amazon.com and others). <br>  5. For all the points, an important note: I like music, including Russian, as well as not very well-known ...

      Perhaps we will begin. <br>  We start with the closest (due to pre-installation): <br><br><h4>  <b>Windows Media Player (http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/ru/)</b> </h4><br>  The main window of the library allows you to sort your music files by artist, album or genre. <br>  All three modes support cover.  Cute if you have a cover uploaded. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/59b/629/6bd/59b6296bd00d7dc5150176c3e961f978.jpg"><br><br>  Information search on the Internet WMP conducts on the basis of microsoft.  He finds well-known performers, but even they have covers with covers ... If there are no covers, a gray note flaunts instead. <br>  There is, however, the ability to assign a cover manually - paste from the clipboard.  How to remove an existing cover (I mistakenly inserted a screenshot instead of a cover) - I did not find it, I had to replace it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bf0/b45/529/bf0b45529681c1ba87ae3d2b3c69887b.jpg"><br><br>  Numbering in tags supports only the form: 1, 2, 3, etc., but sorts normally. <br>  There is a search function - it is convenient to look for an artist in collections, for example.  True, the search is case-sensitive.  Naive and Naive for him are different groups. <br>  The tag editor is very simple - what I see is what I am editing.  One by one.  Only the album name, year, author, genre is massively edited. <br>  Rename WMP can, it is set in the menu "copy from CD", but it works for everything.  can be in automatic mode.  not a very wide range of settings. <br>  Star system - supported. <br>  For some reason, some of my library showed questions.  The true value of the file could be guessed only by listening to it (or by reading the file name in the properties, if possible) ... <br>  There are also additional functions - recording discs, riping, watching videos and DVDs, as well as online radio.  All - in the base set.  Free. <br><br>  Editing tags 3/5 For editing will come down.  To fill - a chore. <br>  Download tags from the network 3/5 Supports only its database <br>  Rename files 4/5 Renames. <br>  Working with covers 4/5 You can put your own, download from the base Microsoft. <br>  4/5 work speed Works quickly, loads the base in the background. <br>  Sync 4/5 Supports removable devices.  Iphone is not supported. <br>  Total score 3.66 / 5 <br><br>  Summary: if everything is good with your media library, you don‚Äôt have an iPhone, then you can safely use Windows Media Player.  Beautiful, convenient, and most importantly - out of the box and free! <br><br><h4>  <b>iTunes 8.2 ( <a href="http://www.apple.com/ru/itunes/download/">http://www.apple.com/en/itunes/download/</a> )</b> </h4><br>  Together with the iPhone, iTunes (tuna) came to me.  With its help, you can not only listen to music, watch videos, but also synchronize your Iphone, make purchases on aytyuns store, buy programs, backup data. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b91/9e6/df6/b919e6df606b40894460e5e49516d916.jpg"><br><br>  The main window is a player and media library.  There are three modes: list, icons, as well as CowerFlow (yes, that one). <br>  In icon mode, you can sort by albums, artists, genre, by composer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a3/b43/1b9/7a3b431b96a520cec508c0befac75eee.jpg"><br><br>  There is a convenient search.  Register independent. <br>  Tag Editor is quite a good one.  Supports a huge number of fields.  Understands the word "collection", downloads covers from the Internet (unfortunately, the database has its own, besides Russian performers cannot be found there), and you can also download them yourself (from the clipboard or from a file). <br>  Bulk tag editor is present.  There is an import of names from the Internet, but, again, for Russians and few popular artists - not much help. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e16/013/6b7/e160136b74d3e2e5a7d8bf87cbbad486.jpg"><br><br>  Among other things - there are features iTunes DJ and Genius.  To compile your playlists. <br>  Star system is fully supported. <br>  I didn‚Äôt find an update of the media library in iTunes (acre, how to collect everything in the ‚ÄúiTunes directory‚Äù) (if, for example, files were moved or renamed) ... Therefore, it is not very convenient. <br><br>  Editing tags 4,5 / 5 It is convenient to change tags to albums, individual tracks.  To compile collections. <br>  Download tags from the network 3/5 Supports only its database <br>  Rename files 3/5 Not very extensive <br>  Working with covers 4,5 / 5 You can put your own, download from iTunes. <br>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äã3.5 / 5 Does not work very fast, loads the database in the background.  Eats away solid memory. <br>  Sync 3.5 / 5 Only iPhone is supported.  But - in full. <br>  Total score 3.66 / 5 <br><br>  Summary: if you have an iphone, you already use aytyunz.  There is not enough function to rename files and correct behavior with single files.  As a player - good, but cumbersome. <br><br>  Free. <br><br><h4>  <b>MediaMonkey 3.1 ( <a href="http://www.mediamonkey.com/">http://www.mediamonkey.com/</a> )</b> </h4><br>  About MediaMonkey, I remembered by chance.  I remember it in versions 1.x.  Then I did not like it.  What now? <br>  MediaManka looks good.  Beautiful, comfortable. <br>  The library is based on any characteristic of the file.  Even including the location! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c57/1dd/69b/c571dd69b1063c2833f7f8aed4938317.jpg"><br><br>  Tag editor is great.  Mass and single editing is supported.  You can make collections.  Looks for covers on the Internet, as well as in tags of neighboring files and on disk. <br>  Information about the track can be obtained on the Internet on amazon.com, but he does not know Russian. <br>  Search in the media library is very, very convenient.  Searches everywhere and everything. <br>  Star system is supported. <br>  With the right firmware, mediamanks perfectly sync the iPhone.  With firmware 3.0 - only reading from iphone.  YUSB players supported buy default. <br>  Rename files very well, however, the numbers are only in the format 1, 2, 3. In view of this, the files in the directory are in the order 1,10,11,12 ... etc.  - not very convenient.  Update: habrarey prompted that you can change the template and everything will be cool.  THANK! <br>  In addition, MediaMonkey supports the WMP library, iTunes (import).  The full version of the program (paid) supports folder monitoring. <br>  The free version copes with all the tasks assigned, if the media library does not often change. <br>  The paid version can monitor, convert audio, rip and write discs. <br><br>  Editing tags 4,5 / 5 It is convenient to change tags to albums, individual tracks.  To compile collections. <br>  Download tags from the network 3.5 / 5 Supports only the database amazon.com <br>  Renaming files 4/5 Renames well, including collections, but numbers files in the form 1,2,3. <br>  Working with covers 4,5 / 5 You can put your own, download from the database amazon.com. <br>  Work speed 4.5 / 5 Works quickly, loads the base in the background.  Even when monitoring does not load the system. <br>  Synchronization 4.5 / 5 Supports iPhone, as well as portable devices connected via usb. <br>  Total score 4.25 / 5 <br><br>  Summary: a great program with many features.  Personally, I was upset only by the numbering of files, but amazon.com, which practically does not know Russian. <br><br><h4>  <b>Songbird 1.2.0 ( <a href="http://www.getsongbird.com/">http://www.getsongbird.com/</a> )</b> </h4><br>  I think everyone knows what Firefox is, and as a result, the Gecko engine.  It is on it that Songbird is built - a combine from the player, media library and browser. <br>  Many plug-ins and add-ons to this program do their work - they add convenience, and immediately add errors. <br>  While writing an article, my songbird issued a pas: half of the artists participated in a naive tribute, even foreign ones.  The tags were taken incomprehensibly from where, and the covers of Jane Air appeared in Limp Bizkit ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/937/642/399/937642399dcf3afe71536daf48e7e901.jpg"><br><br>  Edit tags allows massively, singly.  Everything is done in a special window.  Covers loads from the Internet (and for Russians too - found Psyche), and also allows you to download your own. <br>  Star system is supported.  When playing a track, it searches for information on it on last.fm, as well as with musicbrainz. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/234/913/165/2349131651f141330cdf841d6b26fcc7.jpg"><br><br>  The search works strange - ##### did not search.  Apparently something with code and control characters, in general, works fine. <br>  It supports the last.fm account, synchronization with an iPhone (although it only showed free space for me) and usb devices. <br>  Rename files songbird could not.  Maybe you need an addon.  I do not know. <br>  In general, if it were not for today's glitch, then everything is cool.  Is free. <br><br>  Editing tags 4/5 It is convenient to change tags to albums, individual tracks. <br>  Loading tags from the network 3.5 / 5 I did not understand - from where it loads.  For some it is good, some (even foreign ones) do not see the emphasis. <br>  Rename files 0/5 Cannot (maybe need addon) <br>  Work with covers 4,5 / 5 You can put your own, download from the database (from where I don‚Äôt know) <br>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äã3.5 / 5 Works smartly, when updating the library a couple of times weighed the system. <br>  Synchronization 4/5 Supports iPhone, as well as portable devices connected via usb. <br>  Final score of 3.25 / 5 <br><br>  Summary: good potential.  If everything continues in the same spirit, it will be the best.  In the meantime, podglyuchivaet. <br><br><h4>  <b>Winamp 5.56 ( <a href="http://www.winamp.com/">http://www.winamp.com/</a> )</b> </h4><br>  Who does not know Winamp?  Everybody knows him!  Even those who are avidly sitting on Linux and Macs.  Do not know him except that the current youth.  Their imagination does not draw pictures with ‚Äúthe most convenient player‚Äù, they don‚Äôt remember the evolution of this player to such a combine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b6e/b28/29c/b6eb2829cee2b59621f70a7c4277fad8.jpg"><br><br>  And what do we have now?  Indeed - a combine resembling the good old player. <br>  Added video playback, added rip drives, piskov disks ... <br>  Added media library.  Good enough (and many who bother her with Winamp). <br>  Among other things, we have a good pack of skins, support for tags, a system of stars. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fa3/954/00d/fa395400ded7bcc9aea2ea9acc66ada8.jpg"><br><br>  By the principle of media library Winamp well done.  In my memory, to be honest - it was he who was the first. <br>  Search works well, looking for what you need.  Quickly. <br>  There is a monitoring library. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2df/6a0/e94/2df6a0e948d97463b655158278953fda.jpg"><br><br>  There is a tag editor - simple, but at the same time - convenient.  Supported batch change tags. <br>  Autocomplete works.  For domestic performers also worked, but filled in the transliteration.  Fortunately there is a "cancel" button. <br>  Covers can be downloaded from the Internet, from a file.  The base is not extensive.  When playing a file trying to find information about the artist and show. <br>  There are plug-ins for portable players (including iPhones), but I refused to work with iPhones.  Just did not see him. <br><br>  Editing tags 4/5 It is convenient to change tags to albums, individual tracks. <br>  Download tags from the network 3.5 / 5 Autocomplete not very.  Russian - transliteration. <br>  Rename files 0/5 Cannot (maybe need a plugin) <br>  Working with covers 4/5 You can put your own, download from the database (the base is not very good) <br>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äã3.5 / 5 Despite the monstrosity - it works smartly.  Depends on skins.  The media library does not load very quickly <br>  Synchronization 4/5 Supports iPhone, as well as portable devices connected via usb. <br>  Total score 3.16 / 5 <br><br>  Summary: from a pretty little player became a monster with intrusive windows (although they are disabled in the classic form - it is also a pretty little player). <br><br><h4>  <b>AIMP 2.51.330 ( <a href="http://www.aimp.ru/">http://www.aimp.ru/</a> )</b> </h4><br>  A young, fast-developing project - they would write about it in reviews. <br>  I agree.  Young, but firmly on his feet and having an army of fans. <br>  I found out about him by chance from an employee. <br>  I decided to look.  When you first start the very first thought - oh!  Winamp with a new cover! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ff4/679/e02/ff4679e0212b90daa03c80127636b3b5.jpg"><br><br>  There are plug-ins to work with lastfm, plugin for the library, as well as a separate tag editor and file converter. <br>  Separately rendered tag editor.  My media library editor loaded a long time. <br>  Bulk tag editor is.  Covers can be downloaded from a file.  From the network, nothing is looking for.  How to make a collection - I do not understand. <br>  In the media library mode, the player comes to a more convenient mode - you can select an artist, an album.  View information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ad5/758/552/ad5758552afd5e589c9e773c4eb16257.jpg"><br><br>  There is a system of stars. <br>  Sometimes the player hangs. <br>  File renaming is in the tag editor (a separate component).  Found in the same place autofilling tags from the file name. <br><br>  Editing tags 4/5 It is convenient to change tags to albums, individual tracks.  Base tags are supported. <br>  Download tags from the network 0/5 There is no such function (in the standard package) <br>  Rename files 4,5 / 5 Renames files, and also fills tags from file names.  Group operations. <br>  Working with covers 3/5 You can put your own from files. <br>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãof work 3,5 / 5 Sometimes I hung up, but in general - a smart comrade <br>  Synchronization 0/5 There is no such function (in the standard package) <br>  Total score 2.5 / 5 <br><br>  Summary: young project.  Add the ability to download data from the Internet and synchronize with devices - will be a great tool. <br><br><h4>  <b>Foobar2000 v0.9.6.7 ( <a href="http://www.foobar2000.org/">www.foobar2000.org</a> )</b> </h4><br>  At the request of many of the habrovtsev, I add a review of the player Foobar2000 <br>  The player itself is a very austere creation.  But this is only a plus for him.  Nothing extra. <br>  Much if not all is customized. <br>  Memory consumes incomparably less previous programs. <br>  In this review, I explore FUBAR without additionally downloaded plug-ins - everything in the basic version from the official site. <br>  My window looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a74/33a/e51/a7433ae51153e1c868b0e482c7787b70.jpg"><br><br>  You can customize to your taste without problems.  Including there is a view from catalogs, by albums, artist and other parameters. <br>  Mass operations are supported: renaming, taking information from tags, editing tags in bulk. <br>  About editing tags a couple more words: any tags are supported.  Even your own if you want.  There is a download from the freedb database. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5ed/b66/7f3/5edb667f30d8916fdba1efd6d7402c6e.jpg"><br>  Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt understand how to edit and add covers. <br>  They are displayed. <br>  Directly in the player, you can convert audio, you can fix a broken stream or the header of a MP3 file, you can do almost anything you want. <br>  Supported collections.  No star system (found?). <br><br>  Editing tags 5/5 Editing tags is very convenient, including mass. <br>  Load tags from the network 3/5 Supports only freedb database (in the base distribution) <br>  Rename files 5/5 All you want and how you want. <br>  Work with covers 2/5 Shows. <br>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãof work 4,5 / 5 Works quickly, a little long processes tags in large quantities. <br>  Sync 0/5 Did not find such a function in the basic version. <br>  Total score 3.75 / 5 <br><br>  Summary: Small, very smart, comfortable.  Flexible. <br><br><h4>  <b>NokiaMusic 1.3.20702.00 ( <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/get-support-and-software/download-software/nokia-music-old/download">http://europe.nokia.com/get-support-and-software/download-software/nokia-music-old/download</a> )</b> </h4><br>  The very last one I added to the review utility from Nokia. <br>  It downloaded smartly, it was installed beautifully.  She asked where to store. <br>  Looks beautiful! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/754/bee/624/754bee6249591aa494eabd048f1ecfcc.jpg"><br>  It works sooo slow.

True, I did not earn =) <br>  The fourth impression is the cover!  Very comfortably!  loads cool !!! <br>  Fifth impression - fucking handy tag editor! <br>  Sixth - download information from the Internet!  Amazon, Yahu, Google, Discogs! <br>  Seventh - renames files as necessary !!! <br>  Eighth - the library works smartly! <br>  Ninth - Search!  case-insensitive and fast! <br>  Tenth - updates the library (cleansing deleted!) <br><br>  A fly in the ointment - paid.  And I didn‚Äôt like the playing system very much - first in the playlist, then in the play.
