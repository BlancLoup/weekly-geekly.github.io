No, no, no, and no again: we ride on everything, ‚Äúboth to the tail and to the mane‚Äù - on asphalt and sand, in heat and rain, with dust and falls - only this way you can ‚Äúfeel‚Äù the piece of iron and form an impression about it . <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/maccentre/blog/458350/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5e7/1d2/ad3/5e71d2ad3c99c599405d1cf91f7a354c.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Today there will be a dirty review of one of the most affordable electric bikes of Twitter (no, not the same one) - <b>VS7.0-ER</b> (do not immediately remember the name of the model).

      In large cities (especially in Moscow), the car is increasingly turning from a vehicle into luxury: gasoline, traffic jams, parking, taxes, thousands of fines.  But it is difficult to refuse a personal car - each of us has situations when neither taxi nor car-sharing will replace it.  Metro, buses, trams ... yes, everything is fine, but often you need to get to the same metro, and public transport is tightly tied to routes and not always convenient. <br><br>  Scooters, mono-rollers, rollers?  Yes, it is compact, maneuverable and economical, but all this is convenient only at short distances - it is obviously inconvenient to go from the Moscow region to the center on rollers / mono-wheel.  No matter if it‚Äôs an electric bike, I sat down and went: at least 20 km, at least 50, you want to be driven by a motor, you want to drag it by force of two, you don‚Äôt have to carry it.  Well, plus the health benefits and shape.  Anyway, summer is made for the bike.  What you need? <br><br><h2>  The lineup </h2><br>  In the model range of the VS7.0 line, there are already three versions of electric <b>jets</b> : <b>VS7.0-ER100</b> , <b>VS7.0-ER</b> and <b>VS7.0-EM</b> .  Visually, they look almost the same, but only one letter / tsiferka significantly affects both the characteristics and the price.  We have already briefly told about this in the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/maccentre/blog/426293/">summary publication</a> , but it will not be a sin to repeat it. <br><br><div class="scrollable-table"><table><tbody><tr><th>  VS7.0-ER100 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/805/7fb/6ec/8057fb6ec7e2b4c42f9d95c88483def8.png"></th><th>  VS7.0-ER <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/81e/76d/f0d/81e76df0d92064ed8f475d9f3941cc1b.png"></th><th>  VS7.0-EM <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6a2/d5e/563/6a2d5e5632a005ea11c500f5280223b7.png"></th></tr></tbody></table></div><br><ul><li>  <b>VS7.0-ER100</b> <br><br>  The most affordable electric bike in the model range is designed for measured driving in the city and beyond.  Equipped with Shimano Tourney and Altus switches and brakes.  21 speed, three driving modes.  In the hybrid mode, the model provides five different options for the operation of the electric motor.  With a weight of almost 20 kg, it develops a speed of up to 35 km / h and is capable of driving on a single charge in scooter mode up to 30 km. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="http://twitter-bikes.ru/product/vs70-er100">Full specifications</a> <br></li><li>  <b>VS7.0-ER</b> (model from the review) <br><br>  Despite the more ‚Äúsimple‚Äù name, it is more sophisticated (in comparison with its ‚Äúbrother‚Äù above): <br><br>  - Engine power with a gearbox of 350 W compared to 250 W in the ER100; <br>  - Battery capacity 480 W ¬∑ h compared to 360 W ¬∑ h; <br>  - The maximum mileage in help mode is up to 120 km instead of 90 km on the ER100, and in scooter mode up to 40 km instead of 30. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="http://twitter-bikes.ru/product/vs70-er">Full specifications</a> <br></li><li>  <b>VS7.0-EM</b> <br><br>  The most stuffed model, withstands more weight due to the design.  It has speed switches and Shimano Alivio shifters - a higher class than Altus and Tourney.  Instead of a motor-wheel, the VS7.0-EM uses a trolley motor with the largest torque in the range - 80 Nm (instead of 60 for the models above).  And at the same time - more comfortable weight distribution (when climbing uphill with the drive off, this is noticeable), which also provides a more convenient service.  Autonomy is the same as the ER version. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="http://twitter-bikes.ru/product/vs70-em">Full specifications</a> </li></ul><br><h2>  Appearance </h2><br>  Today there will be no pictures without dust particles, to the comments ‚Äúhow can a bike be done like that!‚Äù We are ready.  Moreover - we plan to make a separate publication about the maintenance of the bicycle using the example of a clever two-suspension (which most of all got under the distribution) - would it be interesting to read?  Write in the comments your questions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ca9/855/6c4/ca98556c4df88db2b0d1a0a5ffc51c2b.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Bicycle starts with a frame.</b>  In the VS7.0-ER, this is a typical aluminum (6061) triangle with a size of 17 "- 15-inch version (like, for example, the Mantis line) or some other one here. The upper and lower frame tubes have a slightly" triangular "section, while the seat tube is round, and accurate seamless welding is used, which adds points to the appearance of the bicycle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b06/af6/8ef/b06af68ef332ff54794b4b8165dcf6cd.jpg"><br><br>  But what removes the points is the controller unit located under the bottom of the frame - it looks somewhat cumbersome and unusual, in the models from the previous review all the electronics were hidden either in the battery (in the Mantis series models) or in the frame itself (as in carbon <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/maccentre/blog/422371/">TW -E9L</a> ).  But there are advantages to this - it will be easier to maintain such a unit (in which case) than picking the same frame.  On the go, this box also does not interfere in any way - it is not a low point and does not touch anything. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/735/d73/08e/735d7308e060ea15bede802eb6af497e.jpg"><br><br>  The bicycle battery is located on the lower tube of the frame - it is removable (fitted on the guide), with a mechanical anti-theft lock (2 keys included) and with a charge indicator (there is a separate button for this). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/88b/0b2/dfe/88b0b2dfe1b468dd8e98c3093daef40b.jpg"><br><br>  And he also has a rubberized plug, under which are located the USB connector for charging devices, a connector for charging the battery itself, and a button for its hardware shutdown. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ca/2bb/368/2ca2bb3689804f5e7b6c7a91f79e67f1.jpg"><br>  <i>The USB connector turns the bike into a large power bank: if you want, charge the smartphone (the same trackers pretty quickly recharge the charge of the smartphone), if you want, a column (which there‚Äôs already nowhere to hook), you want a flashlight.</i>  <i>Y is convenient.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/17c/35b/270/17c35b27002f817a37ca3cd6027a4fbf.jpg" align="left">  The battery capacity is 480 W ¬∑ h (48 V, 10 A ¬∑ h).  Inside - lithium-ion elements of the company LG (judging by the name of the model, CBT-13S3P, there are 13 consecutive blocks of 3 parallel elements 18650) - the manufacturer claims up to 120 km on one charge in the mode of assistance. <br><br>  Many, few?  How many trips do you drive 120 km? <br><br>  In the front cassette three stars, behind - 9, a total of 27 speeds.  Once again you will write that not all of them can go for a long time, but you can‚Äôt push it against mathematics - 3 by 9 equals 27 :) Cassette - SUGEK-9S (11-34T), choosing a comfortable driving mode is not a problem. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b51/7c3/298/b517c3298ff336a85b7e6297d665e31d.jpg"><br><br>  As mentioned above, the Shimano Altus set (more precisely, the M370) is responsible for switching speeds - an inexpensive and relatively high-quality switch designed for MTB at the primary and secondary levels. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/786/605/cc3/786605cc3a4b06cba55ccb4a14e4089b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f6/83a/55c/1f683a55cf2a4c4b8aa806f9e83cc57f.jpg"><br><br>  The manufacturer calls the switch design low-profile (such as a frame pressed closer to the stars of the cassette - for better switching, less resistance and so that the hair was smooth and silky), as well as increased resistance to dirt.  Checked on several long and "dirty" trips - normal flight.  There is a cable tension regulator for fine adjustment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/027/e94/4b2/027e944b224c029355ef3b2e1a98c931.jpg"><br>  <i>Chain YBN-9S</i> <br><br>  Brakes - disc mechanical.  Shimano Tourney TX is suitable for Altus, simple and unpretentious, with perforated discs and rather large pads. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/287/9e8/24d/2879e824d8bab7f559aaea2d0f8a0182.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/028/619/ee5/028619ee56f8e0da41bc19b97f80bf25.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee8/109/7fa/ee81097fac0e76e847cdd0bb78e60e3c.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, yes, the wheels are 26-inch, with a Retrospec rim (as in previous models, almost all of the accessories are from this brand) and KENDA-1187 tires (26 "√ó 1.95").  The same tires were in more MTB-shny models, for example, on Twitter Mantis - nothing has changed since the last reviews, they are still as comfortable to drive around the city as well as off-road. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/593/a6c/c92/593a6cc922bb9cc20900b467033f9f9f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1df/00e/c4e/1df00ec4edefe7aa17725faaef03d1b8.jpg"><br><br>  A brushless electric motor (gearmotor-wheel) with marking 48V350W18054609 is built into the rear wheel.  I'm certainly not a doctor, but there is a feeling that it is designed for a voltage of 48 V, and the power is 350 watts.  What the technical characteristics confirm :) The reducer has a free-wheel clutch (in order not to expend energy when riding a muscular strain).  About impressions from riding on this little engine - a little later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5a6/ac8/f8d/5a6ac8f8d1594f92dc6aff6bd6bfe909.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/339/229/61d/33922961d54c74b19ffdebeaa5b4ec97.jpg"><br><br>  The seatpost allows you to adjust the height of the seat (comfortable eccentric) in a fairly large range - from ‚Äúbmx-style‚Äù to ‚Äúfor a <a href="https://habr.com/ru/article/457126/">special project</a> ‚Äù :) The seat of eco-leather, comfortable, does not rub at long distances. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c93/c7e/c10/c93c7ec10cb09d3379200be9df384df1.jpg"><br><br>  Included are two reflectors: one just under the saddle, the second - on the steering wheel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/370/916/295/3709162957a0a96ef2ad8416504209fc.jpg"><br><br>  The rods and pedals from Retrospec - more than once such met, no complaints.  Also, the bike is equipped with a step, installed on the rear left feather - so that the bike can be beautifully put and inform the social network of the next trip. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a9a/6bc/b02/a9a6bcb022ac0ec3fee588137fdac1a9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c4e/d03/930/c4ed039309718808add2ac8ec5a4f147.jpg"><br><br>  The front wheel has a suspension fork with the possibility of its blocking (manual) and the preload setting (the position of the fork in the state of static load).  The stroke is about 100 mm.  There is no rear shock absorber - we have an inexpensive hardtail for the city and parks :) But it is worth paying tribute, riding even with one shock absorber is quite comfortable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/735/fa2/615/735fa26158b4691be5122d9dd7edf803.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cf0/2b3/de9/cf02b3de91e8bd34a178952a3e1c5f4b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/858/516/8db/8585168db16d8fd4d8015b03aa27fa68.jpg"><br><br>  So what else is left of what is not looked?  And the most interesting!  Steering and body kit on it! <br><br>  The wheel is the most common MTB-shny (from Retrospec), on a small offset. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8b3/c70/cf0/8b3c70cf076206914c606e1287cc471d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b13/5d5/b0f/b135d5b0f9c1bdd83ef023a38008c5f1.jpg"><br><br>  Along the edges there are rubberized grips, which 1) differ from those that <a href="http://twitter-bikes.ru/product/vs70-er">appear</a> on the site 2) are not very comfortable on long journeys and dirt gets clogged in them 3) can be changed at any time. <br><br>  Next to the handles, there are shifters of speeds (on the left - front ones, on the right - rear ones): I really liked how they work, but speed markings seemed a bit strange - only boundary values ‚Äã‚Äãwere marked (1 - 3, 1 - 9).  Although if you are not the first time behind the wheel, then the indicators will not pay attention. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/23e/db7/9f7/23edb79f7f90e7494e585067726f6518.jpg"><br><br>  There are also brake handles.  Initially, they are not very conveniently exposed, I had to turn / twist them ‚Äúfor myself‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5ef/8e8/edf/5ef8e8edf3f371081aebdb1e2ba259bb.jpg"><br><br>  Well, as a cherry on the cake: on the left of the handle is the on-board computer, and on the right is a petal for turning on electromotive magic.  Both are conveniently located, although the on-board computer looks more familiar (and more comfortable for reading information) in the central part of the steering wheel.  If in the same Mantis the on-board computer was separate from the engine control buttons, then here they are combined in one device with three buttons: ‚ÄúM‚Äù (on / off) and ‚Äúreduce / increase‚Äù power. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/311/405/960/311405960990df2c2d9f5d7368f94531.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e27/716/dd8/e27716dd8ffdad78a924ed74a2ca2ab6.jpg"><br><br>  Cable management ... well, to some extent it is present: part of the wires goes inside the frame (brake cables), part is attached with ties. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a3/9e2/77a/4a39e277aaf37cb850e0ea2fa32d54b7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5e1/f01/6b4/5e1f016b4de757bb0c04ddce94312d84.jpg"><br><br>  There are more wires than usual - additional ones ensure the presence of a ‚Äúscooter‚Äù mode - from the brake to the motor, so that the motor does not continue to work when braking.  When there are so many wires, it is hardly possible to organize everything neatly for reasonable money.  The most "terrible" is not in sight, but from below (but also not critical): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/efd/69c/5da/efd69c5da015854fc0a5db6b37ce3a0b.jpg"><br><br>  With the look of everything.  We pull all eccentrics (on wheels, at the saddle), screws ... and go! <br><br><h2>  Tests </h2><br>  If it were not for the motor and the battery, then Twitter VS7.0-ER was an average bicycle, but it would not be so interesting and appropriate (on Habr√©) - you can pedal on any bike.  But it is worth pressing two buttons ... and two new modes will be added to the mode of driving on muscular <s>burden</s> : the mode of assisting (when the motor helps to pedal) and the <s>cheater</s> mode of the scooter (when the bike carries you and you relax). <br><br>  First of all, we charge the battery - for this, a charger (54.6 V, 2 A), khm, with a fan is included with the bike.  Well, ok, let it buzz - less likely that the filling will melt.  A full charge cycle is 5-6 hours - long, but this lasts a long time, that is, you will not have to charge the bike every day.  As a paverbank for 20,000 in the depths of a backpack :) <br><br>  To call the electric assistance, press the red button under the rubber cover on the battery (which you can not turn off at all, except during long periods of inactivity - for example, in winter).  And then - hold down the "M" button on the on-board computer.  The screen will immediately light up, but the ‚Äúpower reserve‚Äù in kilometers will not appear on it - instead of it, the battery charge in%.  As well as mileage (for the trip or for all time) and the current level of assistance of the electric motor.  Levels five - 0 (does not help) and from 1 to 5 (it is regulated by the buttons "+" and "-" on the panel).  The higher the level, the more the motor will help with each pedal rotation (which in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe carriage is monitored by the PAS; pedal sensor): if you still have to sweat on the ‚Äúone‚Äù, then you can go to ‚Äú5‚Äù even on the hill for the most ‚Äúheavy stars‚Äù playfully rest.  During the assistance is not very loud, but the hum.  There is also a ‚Äúpedestrian mode‚Äù - we hold down ‚Äú-‚Äù and the bike will help to drive it (useful when climbing uphill). <br><br>  During the test, the VS7.0-ER really enjoyed driving in all three modes: <br><br><ul><li>  In bike mode, this is a good big one with MTB-tricks, with smooth gear shifting, with effective brakes and a rather soft ‚Äúsuspension‚Äù. </li><li>  In the mode of assistance - all the same good is great, but with the ability to increase the distance of arrival, helping in difficult situations.  Personally, my comfortable ‚Äúbar‚Äù - around 30 km at a time (along a forest road) - on a regular bike after this distance, the legs are ‚Äúhammered‚Äù, the loin and wrists get tired, the feet begin to ‚Äúburn‚Äù.  And then I drove through 40+ - yes, I still had some discomfort, but at least I didn‚Äôt have to go ‚Äúthrough force‚Äù. </li><li>  In scooter mode - the most cheating option, but if it is, then it is a sin not to use it sometimes.  For example, I turned it on when I had to respond to a message in the phone - pedaling, it's harder to do (they say, you can still stop, but these are not our methods).  Or to get to work - if it is 20-30 km away, then one charge will be enough to get there and back on one electroarm.  Yes, even if more than 30 km one way - you can also remove the battery and charge during operation.  There is no need to pour gasoline, or stand in traffic jams, or look for a parking space - threw a backpack, pressed a button, and drove (dry).  In the summer - a thrill, inaccessible to the ordinary bike. <br><br>  In this mode, a bike on a flat road can accelerate (about 15 seconds) to 35 km / h - a rather high speed.  The motor is switched off to a higher one, so if you want to overtake cars, then this opportunity is at your feet :) Well, or change to a highway. </li></ul><br>  The brakes showed themselves exceptionally well, but soon a creak appeared in the front wheel - it was removed by adjusting the brake disc. <br><br>  Information from the screen is read in any weather (even in bright sun, unlike a computer in TW-E9L) and even in the dark (due to backlighting), but, as I wrote above, in the central part of the steering wheel it would look ‚Äúmore convenient‚Äù . <br><br>  Two things that did not like: <br><br><ul><li>  There is no headlight (to illuminate the road ahead) and a rear light (to be more noticeable on the road).  Yes, it is not a tragedy and you can buy a suitable one to choose from, but 1) out of the box is not ready for night runs 2) at retail it will be more expensive than the wholesale batch to the manufacturer and 3) in the same <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/maccentre/blog/414381/">Airwheel R8 there</a> was a built-in light and it was cool.  Oh, and the wings would not be mad. </li><li>  The bike is still heavy (almost 20 kg), especially the rear part - due to the motorcycle (although the battery adds about 2.5 kg).  The engine in the carriage (as in VS7.0-EM) would certainly make the bike more balanced.  No, during the ride it doesn't matter much, but if you live on the 4th floor of a five-storey building without an elevator, it is palpable :) </li></ul><br>  For the rest - exceptionally pleasant is great, with a no less pleasant ratio "price / quality". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/54e/4b0/a97/54e4b0a979a10567a301d1625279eae3.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Technical specifications Twitter VS7.0-ER </h2><br>  <b>Size of wheels:</b> 26 " <br>  <b>Frame Size:</b> 17.0 " <br>  <b>Color of the bicycle:</b> Black-red / black-yellow / white-red <br>  <b>Bicycle weight:</b> 19.8 kg <br>  <b>Frame:</b> Aluminum alloy 6061 <br>  <b>Steering wheel:</b> Aluminum alloy with matte finish <br>  <b>Plug:</b> Retrospec, with manual locking <br>  <b>Steering column:</b> Aluminum alloy, CNC 44 mm <br>  <b>Gear Levers:</b> Shimano Altus, 27 Speed <br>  <b>Front gear shift:</b> Shimano Altus <br>  <b>Rear gear selector:</b> Shimano Altus <br>  <b>Rods:</b> Aluminum alloy, square hole, 22-32-44T <br>  <b>Cassette:</b> SUGEK-9S, 11-34T <br>  <b>Chain:</b> YBN-9S <br>  <b>Carriage:</b> KENLI, square holes, bearing BB68 <br>  <b>Brakes:</b> Shimano Tourney, mechanical disc <br>  <b>Bushings:</b> RS, aluminum alloy, 2-bearing, for disc brakes <br>  <b>Rims:</b> Retrospec RS300, aluminum alloy, double pistoned <br>  <b>Spokes:</b> SHUNJIU, ruggedized <br>  <b>Tires:</b> KENDA-1187, 26 "√ó 1.95" <br>  <b>Handles:</b> Retrospec <br>  <b>Saddle:</b> Retrospec <br>  <b>Pedals:</b> Retrospec CNC, for mountain bikes, on bearings, aluminum alloy <br>  <b>Usage modes:</b> 3 modes <br>  <b>Help Modes:</b> 5 Modes <br>  <b>Mileage on a single charge:</b> 40 km (in scooter mode), up to 120 km (in help mode) <br>  <b>Maximum speed:</b> Up to 35 km / h <br>  <b>Maximum user weight:</b> 120 kg <br>  <b>Battery:</b> LG-18650 lithium-ion, 48 V, 10 Ah <br>  USB port for charging gadgets <br>  <b>Full charge time:</b> 5-6 hours <br>  <b>Number of recharge cycles:</b> 800-1000 times <br>  <b>Motor:</b> Rear motor-wheel, 48 V, 350 W <br>  Brushless DC motor with reduced noise <br>  <b>Maximum torque:</b> 60 N ¬∑ m <br>  <b>Controller:</b> 5 modes of use <br>  <b>Monitor:</b> LCD display <br>  <b>Monitor features:</b> Speed, mileage, charge level, mode, etc. <br>  <b>The parameters you can set are:</b> Reset mileage, wheel size, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ca/606/60d/7ca60660d50ef7b2b4e413dedb6e835b.jpg"><br><br>  Yes, by the way - Twitter VS7.0-ER is available in three colors: black and red (as in the review), black and green, and white and red.
