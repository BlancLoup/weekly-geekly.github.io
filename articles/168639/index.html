  <section class="page js-page"><h1>So is it Total Commander or Explorer?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I undertook to write this post spontaneously, under the influence of instant indignation!  For a long time I have been trying to teach my wife to work on a computer competently and quickly.  For example, I can not look at it as it copies the file from one folder to another for five minutes or how it archives it.  I always say ‚Äúuse Total Commander‚Äù to her, forget about the explorer (or My Computer).  I show her how quickly I perform various operations in this program: I look through files, sort, search, copy, move, archive, connect via FTP, use color highlighting, tabs, panel labels and a huge pile of other things. <br>  So I teach her, I teach, and suddenly, ten minutes ago, she writes me on Skype that at work she was asked by their staff sysadmin ‚Äúwhy do you need Total Commander?‚Äù, To which she said that her husband was saying.  And he told her a whole tirade about the fact that TC is the last century, that you need to use a Windows file manager, that nowadays native applications, visualization and other ideological nonsense are important !!! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I‚Äôm shocked, I‚Äôm furious, I‚Äôm wondering: how is it that an IT person says such words!  I begin to think, maybe I really do not understand something, maybe I really got carried away by some kind of ideology that I don‚Äôt see where the world is going.  Or maybe I just do not know how to work in the explorer to do all the same operations as in Total Commander with the same speed and performance? <br>  And in the end, I come to the following conclusion (I will now write and wait with horror for public censure, but still I will risk it). <br>  I would like to make a reservation in advance that at least in this case we are talking about Total Commander, but the name of the file manager does not really matter.  This could be FAR, Frigate, etc.  Speech about NOT the conductor.  About the file manager with two duplicate panels.  Therefore, I ask in comments not to throw phrases like ‚Äúnafig you this TC, use FAR‚Äù.  Now we are talking about something else.  It is about a specialized file manager type TC vs. Explorer.  I just use TC. <br>  So, to what conclusion I came.  It seems to me that those people (and there are not a few of them), especially from the IT environment, often reject programs like TC precisely for some kind of ‚Äúideological‚Äù (did not pick up another word) considerations.  That sysadmin at work his wife began to carry something about visualization, fashion, etc.  Citizens, what visualization ???  I would like to ask him: dear comrade, how do you think, in which program it is faster to make an elementary operation of copying a file from one folder to another?  Maybe I do not know all the secrets of the conductor, but I would never believe that it can be done faster in it than in TC.  I sometimes see how much time people spend on working with files in the explorer and think about how much faster I do in TC.  I know that someone can work quickly and in the conductor, but still he does not compete with a specialized file manager. <br>  I think this is from the same series, when people put ubuntu at home (I‚Äôm shredded to me right now), suffer with it, toil, but they keep saying that MS is r ... oh.  That Linux is cool!  And do not care what kind of problems arise.  I know that ubunt is advanced right now, that many things can be done, like on Windows, but nevertheless, there are problems.  I understand people at work write under linux, and put this OS, but some of them put it at home because of their views and ideology.  It is less convenient than Windows and this is a fact and there is no way out of it! <br>  Many people hate the Outlook email client just because it is Microsoft.  Only because of this!  Where is the rationality and logic?  One ideology.  But this is an excellent and convenient (may I survive after this post) program. <br>  Many do not even perceive the maker-ups who impose in Dreamweaver or other visual editors.  You need to write in a notebook, this is what true gurus do.  Here is the highest point of excellence.  Yes, what the hell is there a point!  I agree that being able to write in a notebook without anything is an indicator of skill.  But oh my goodness, I write in Dreamweaver (or another editor) because it's faster !!!  I do not need to search the 1000 lines of code for the desired element when I can click on it in the display area and it will instantly be highlighted in the code.  I use it just like a text editor, as it would be in a notebook, except for the fact that I have a convenient opportunity to see immediately what I am doing and quickly search for the necessary elements.  It is convenient for me when prompts pop up and I don‚Äôt need to type ‚Äútext-align: right‚Äù when this program can write for me.  I almost do not use tools on the toolbar.  Naturally, if I need to draw a table or a block, I do it with pens in the code.  Therefore, I work faster than it would in a notebook.  No one will convince me that even the coolest in the world maker-up will find a picture <img src="http://‚Äùxxxx‚Äù">  in code faster than I do in the visual editor. <br>  So why talk about ideology and slope, when there are programs that simply help us work more productively.  So with Total Commander, I switched to other examples, but I thought my thought conveyed my thought. <br>  Total Commander works faster.  The quality of work does not depend on whether it is a TC or a conductor, but the speed depends.  So maybe it should go to him at least because of this? </div>
