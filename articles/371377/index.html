Restaurants where robots feed you</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lf/-q/i8/lf-qi8wwhqefpl31sygmyzwazv8.jpeg"><br><br>  Tired of hearing the phrase "have you already chosen?".  There is a desire to have fun and get into the futuristic atmosphere?  Or just do not want to tip?  If so, visit a restaurant where robots will serve you.  They drive up immediately, do not expect anything from you and will make you feel like a representative of a highly developed human civilization. <br><br>  Restaurants with robots instead of staff open around the world.  In them, customers are served by iron and plastic bartenders and waiters, and mechanical chefs prepare food.  In this post - the story of several characteristic institutions. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h3>  Wheels on wheels </h3><br>  Robots in most restaurants of this type are waiters.  This not only makes the institution interesting, but also allows the owner to save money - the robot does not take time off, it can work overtime and, of course, it does not need to pay salaries.  Robo-waiters began to be used in China since 2006, but then they were thoughtless and resembled toys.  Now their appearance and functionality is evolving. <br><br>  <b>Dalu Robot Restaurant</b> <br>  Jinan, China <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6-/2q/gu/6-2qguxasmkiyg60axrgzruhjug.jpeg"></div><br>  Dalu opened in 2010.  Robo-waiters here resemble droids from the Star Wars films.  Everyone has a sensor with which the robot determines the table at which visitors are waiting for an order. <br><br>  The menu includes dishes of Chinese and European cuisine: traditional soup, meat chop, there is a wide selection of salads.  While visitors are eating, near them is a geisha robot - a dummy in a colorful kimono, which makes sounds and moves limbs. <br><br>  Robo-waiters ride bicycles, meals are transported in the trunk.  In total, 12 robots are involved: in addition to the waiters, there are also hostesses and artists who entertain the public with singing and dancing.  The price of each robot is $ 6 thousand. The owner plans to increase the number of robots to 30 and modify them so that they know how to climb the stairs. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q91nt1hlt94" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Hajime Robot Restaurant</b> <br>  Bangkok, Thailand <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wr/dv/cw/wrdvcwkvhhe_wemulffe--acdlk.jpeg"><br><br>  The name of the institution is translated as "Start" or "For the first time."  Some people enjoy when they are served not by ordinary common robots, but the mechanisms from the upper class are real samurai.  Two such devices "work" in a restaurant in the tourist district of Bangkok.  Robots were made to order in Japan. <br><br>  Visitors sit at the tables of two types: for a barbecue (with coals in the middle) and for cooking (with a round stove).  Each table is equipped with a tablet on which the order is made.  A person chooses dishes and presses the "Send to Robot" button.  The samurai robot emerges from a state of deep contemplation of the beautiful, comes to life and advances to serve its customers along the tracks. <br><br>  The restaurant is ready to offer over 100 dishes: fried steaks from imported Japanese beef, salmon, sushi, New Zealand mussels.  Clients <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.ru/Restaurant_Review-g293916-d2734232-Reviews-Hajime_Robot_Restaurant_Rama_3-Bangkok.html">in their comments are</a> satisfied with both the kitchen and colorful robots. <br><br>  Robozamurai behaves not as a formidable warrior, but as a hospitable host - he sings songs and winks (instead of his head - a tablet with a picture of a face).  Each samurai is engaged in 16 tables. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9v1HT7Wr2d0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Cixi</b> <br>  Ningbo, Zhejiang, China <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iw/ra/ea/iwraea2ggxn9q2nii_o2aimqm6o.jpeg"><br><br>  In 2015, a restaurant was opened in Nixbo City Cixi Mall, where customers are served by five robots.  Two serve food, the rest dance at the entrance, thereby attracting customers.  Each robot costs $ 9.5 thousand, but the owner of the institution, Lou Dyke, says that robots have recaptured the money invested in them. <br><br>  Automatic machines are able to speak, they pronounce 40 different phrases.  Optical sensors help them to function properly and move around the room.  One battery charge lasts four hours of work. <br><br><h3>  Chef robot </h3><br>  <b>Haohai Robot Restaurant</b> <br>  Harbin, China <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kb/gc/jo/kbgcjorlwpkhjk9yk3jwljsxdmo.jpeg"><br><br>  Opened in 2012, the restaurant has a staff of two dozen robots.  Some of them are engaged in cooking in the kitchen.  They make noodles, make dumplings, mix drinks.  Their processor brothers carry food, saying warm words to visitors: ‚ÄúGreetings, earthling, at the Robots Restaurant,‚Äù and then entertain them with singing.  The average bill for lunch here is $ 6-10. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nl/et/qx/nletqxa0fqantopp6rgvg7jpum8.jpeg"></div><br>  Robots in Haohai Robot Restaurant can represent up to ten different emotions.  One of them is an exact copy of the robot from the cartoon "WALL-E".  Just in case the devices are controlled by the staff from the computer room.  The price of robots varies from $ 32 thousand to $ 47 thousand. Growth - 130-160 cm. The battery charge lasts for five hours of continuous operation. <br><br>  <b>FuA-Men</b> <br>  Nagoya, Japan <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pw/da/tb/pwdatb_l2vmij2gfxlg0wus7qtw.jpeg"></div><br>  One of the first restaurants with robots, which opened in 2009.  Its full name is ‚ÄúFully Automated RaMen‚Äù (‚Äúfully automated noodles‚Äù).  The chef and his assistant here are autonomous robots created by Aisei. <br><br>  Visitors say that complex dinners, noodles and sushi cooked by robots have excellent taste.  But most of all people like to watch the work of two machines.  ‚ÄúThey cook quickly, but at the same time their gestures are elegant and beautiful,‚Äù say the visitors.  The cooking speed is really amazing: exactly 100 seconds are spent for one portion. <br><br>  With such performance, robots have a lot of free time, which they spend entertaining customers, playing mandzai-style comic scenes.  Favorite miniature among the regulars - one robot threatens the other with a kitchen knife, and the other, hiding from the enemy's anger, closes from the saucepan lid. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PsxX-eA-DMM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  "A robot comes into the bar ..." </h3><br>  Robots not only cook delicious food, but also mix drinks at the bar.  Perhaps the robot bartender will not help with advice and will not pour into debt, but he will definitely listen to everything he says and will not dilute alcohol with water. <br><br>  There are a dozen of such restaurants in the world, the first of them was opened in Nuremberg in 2007, it was finalized until 2016, after which the room was used as an office. <br><br>  <b>Tipsy Robot</b> <br>  Las Vegas, United States <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ja/ax/kn/jaaxknhtyed3g3q2po2qln7-hi8.jpeg"><br><br>  The first in the world restaurant with robots as barmen is considered Tipsy Robot (‚ÄúTipsy Robot‚Äù) in Las Vegas.  KUKA devices here mix cocktails and pour drinks ordered by customers. <br><br>  Robots are completely autonomous.  Ordering can be made through the app on the smartphone or using the tablet on the stand itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/su/4j/ms/su4jmslf7unkfcwdwm7ei72tk2e.jpeg"><br><br>  Robots mix liquids from bottles, which in the amount of 150 pieces are attached down the neck to the ceiling.  Clicking on a special valve on the bottle, the robot measures the right amount of alcohol.  After that, he will even decorate a cocktail with berries or fruits. <br><br>  <b>Rollercoaster</b> <br>  Vienna, Austria <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gq/v6/s4/gqv6s4_rp-vt2bmuyiw8xpcdfos.jpeg"><br><br>  The name of the restaurant is translated as ‚Äúroller coaster‚Äù.  Robo-bartenders mix drinks and send them along steep, twisted in zigzags and spirals small rails - a mini-roller coaster - right up to the client's table.  The menu here is a tablet in which the order is made the same as in the online store.  The tablet is issued at the entrance on the security of any valuable thing. <br><br>  Order information is encoded in a barcode.  That is printed and sent to the robot bartender, who proceeds to the preparation of the drink. <br><br>  Just behind the bar there are two robots.  Customers admit that the best for those is to mix cocktails and ‚Äúdance‚Äù.  Robo-disco takes place every 45 minutes, the machines know ten dances. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/roldSIZpAC4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  Delivery by rail </h3><br>  There are several restaurants in the world where orders are delivered to the visitors' tables by small robotic trains by mini-rail.  They come not only with children.  Adults also appreciate when their burger or beer delivers a train to the sounds of railway beeps. <br><br>  <b>Vytopna</b> <br>  Brno - Prague, Czech Republic <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f-/q6/uc/f-q6ucuzqnhxoxu_8ujxjx_bzng.jpeg"><br><br>  Czech "railway restaurant".  The name can be translated as "The fire chamber of the engine."  Food and drinks are delivered directly to the tables with the help of small trains by rail, the length of which is hundreds of meters.  The locomotive economy of the restaurant is constantly growing, the length of the railway bed is increasing.  This is taken care of by the owners. <br><br>  In total, the Czech Republic has three restaurants V√Ωtopna, the project is a franchise.  The first opened in 2009 in Brno, a little later in Prague two more.  Opening the first point, the founders of the network did not know what success awaits their initiative.  The restaurant was almost always full.  According to estimates of the owner, for all the time the institution served six million customers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jz/a5/9u/jza59uc81o5jioa-ylmu5-tiogq.jpeg"><br><br>  Cuisine - the usual: pizza, pasta, beer, snacks.  Visitors <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.ru/Restaurant_Review-g274707-d1996048-Reviews-Vytopna_Railway_Restaurant_Vaclavske_namesti-Prague_Bohemia.html">say</a> that they come not so much to miss a couple of mugs as to dive into the atmosphere.  Trains with food here move along paths through tunnels in hills and mountains, rush at a speed of 20 km / h along swing bridges over small rivers, go around ponds and slow down, bypassing stations. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis is not the restaurant where people come for a quiet romantic date or where they dine in an elegant evening dress,‚Äù say visitors to Vytopna.  ‚ÄúIt's more like a restaurant for a fun and interesting pastime.‚Äù <br><br>  In the biggest restaurant of the chain, which is located in the Palladium shopping center in Prague, the length of the rails is 1200 meters.  It runs 21 train with digital control.  In Brno, the span is smaller - 400 meters of linen and 3 small rolling stock. <br><br>  <b>Fritz's railroad</b> <br>  Kansas City, United States <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jy/xp/us/jyxpusn1tc66lp7dk7jo6ztr2sq.jpeg"><br><br>  The restaurant was opened in the 1960s.  Offers a large assortment of burgers.  Visitors are not attracted by food, but by serving with mini-trains. <br><br>  The order is made from telephone booths directly in the restaurant hall, after which it is delivered in cargo trailers.  Compositions move along rails with a distinctive railway sound, which makes being in Fritz's Railroad even more interesting. <br><br>  <b><i>More about robotics at robo-hunter.com:</i></b> <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://robo-hunter.com/news/kollaborativnaya-revolyciya-chego-jdat-i-stoit-li-opasatsya9045%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_campaign%3D26-03%26utm_content%3D26-03-1">Collaborative revolution: what to expect and whether to fear</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://robo-hunter.com/news/mifi-o-robotah-mnenie-ekspertov6784%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_campaign%3D26-03%26utm_content%3D26-03-2">Myths about robots.</a>  <a href="https://robo-hunter.com/news/mifi-o-robotah-mnenie-ekspertov6784%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_campaign%3D26-03%26utm_content%3D26-03-2">Expert opinion</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://robo-hunter.com/news/zachem-indii-robot-dlya-ochistki-kanalizacii9694%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_campaign%3D26-03%26utm_content%3D26-03-3">Why India needs a robot to clean the sewer</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://robo-hunter.com/news/robotizaciya-rinok-truda-i-politika9868%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_campaign%3D26-03%26utm_content%3D26-03-4">Robotization: labor market and politics.</a> <a href="https://robo-hunter.com/news/robotizaciya-rinok-truda-i-politika9868%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_campaign%3D26-03%26utm_content%3D26-03-4"><br></a>  <a href="https://robo-hunter.com/news/robotizaciya-rinok-truda-i-politika9868%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_campaign%3D26-03%26utm_content%3D26-03-4">Infographics</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://robo-hunter.com/test%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_campaign%3D26-03%26utm_content%3D26-03-5">Test: can the robot do your job?</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371377/">https://habr.com/ru/post/371377/</a></p>
