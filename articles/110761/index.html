  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Modern "letters of happiness" or "Managers believe in angels"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The article is devoted to one of the problems of Information Security - the fight against successive mailings, which are also called ‚Äúletters of happiness‚Äù in honor of the handwritten progenitors.  The first such messages called ‚Äúheavenly‚Äù or ‚Äúholy letters‚Äù (Himmelsbriefe) appeared in the Middle Ages.  However, we will not be distracted from the topic, and consider the threat of ‚Äúletters of happiness‚Äù from the point of view of Information Security: <br><br><h4>  The hidden danger of ‚Äúletters of happiness‚Äù and similar sequential mailings </h4><br><br>  Many understand that the distribution of data creates a parasitic load on corporate equipment and communication channels.  This is actually the case, however, it is not the greatest danger: the creation of such a chain is one of the mechanisms for obtaining a database of reliable addresses by spammers.  An even greater danger lies in the ‚Äúflare‚Äù of the staff structure of enterprises, which allows attackers to use this information for a variety of purposes.  And the biggest danger, in general at first glance, is invisible - it is social engineering, to identify potentially unreliable and easily influenced by outside employees.  Having received the similar list, malefactors can use this information in the most various purposes. <br>  For example <a name="habracut"></a>  , the most primitive: <br>  - the user is sent a link to the WEB-page with the ‚Äújoke‚Äù, which is actually a viral software (‚ÄúTrojan horse‚Äù).  It is not uncommon for a letter to indicate a recommendation to disable antiviruses while viewing a page. <br>  - if the software installation was successful, then an attacker can gain access not only to the infected PC but to the entire corporate network.  Forgetfulness of users in relation to the requirement for the mandatory shutdown of their personal computers also plays into the hands of intruders.

      In general, it should be borne in mind that the participation of employees in such mailings is a direct reputational risk for the company, and it is the greater, the higher the position of the participant. <br><br>  Now we understand well how much more dangerous the modern ‚Äúletter of happiness‚Äù of our paper ancestor is. <br>  Is there an understanding to the users?  Who in December 2010 believes in angels? <br><br><h4>  TOP companies whose employees are actively forwarding another letter of happiness. </h4><br><br>  LUKOIL and GAZPROM are leading.  Well, still - a huge branch network and an excess of free time create ideal conditions for such mailings.  I will not publish your full name and contact information, and will confine myself to posts so as not to increase reputational risks. <br>  1st place Gazprom: <br><ul><li>  Deputy Head of the Development and Training Department of the Human Resources Department </li><li>  Assistant Director of Geology and Development </li><li>  Far Eastern Branch of GAZFLOT LLC Chief Drilling Engineer </li><li>  Head of HR Department </li><li>  Head of documentation support department </li><li>  Head of the Department of NGOs </li><li>  Leading engineer </li><li>  Leading Specialist for Civil Defense and Emergencies </li><li>  Leading Specialist of Retail Sales Planning and Accounting.

<h5>  If you are an information security officer or other IT professional dealing with information security in a company </h5><br>  You need to filter the content of the letter: <br><br>  Letter body: <br>  <i>May God grant you all good health ...</i> <i><br></i>  <i>True or not, but I want to be fulfilled:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>It walked all over Kazakhstan.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>This morning God opened a window in heaven and asked me: today, what is your greatest desire?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>That was my answer: Oh God, look good to those who are reading this letter now, his family and friends, because they deserve it.</i>  <i>And I love them very much.</i>  <i>The love of God is like an ocean.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>You can see the beginning, but never the end.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Now this letter will begin its action ...</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Those who doubt should know that the one who sent you this letter was surprised that his wish was fulfilled in a short time.</i>  <i>Let's see if this is true.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>It is true that there are angels,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>but sometimes they have no wings, and we call them friends.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Send this letter to your friends and you will get a surprise tonight before 11:11:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>the news you want to hear.</i>  <i>It is not joke.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Someone will call you to tell what you expect to hear ... or one angel will bring you news in a dream.</i>  <i>Do not break this chain.</i>  <i>Send this letter to at least the 10th people you consider to be angels.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>PS I worked after 1 minute !!!</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  and it is very desirable to conduct explanatory work on informing users about the seriousness of the problems associated with modern letters of happiness. <br><br><h5>  If you are an IB / UB employee or are in charge of a company that is on the above list </h5><br>  contact me - I will send you the body of letters of happiness for the "work" with the staff.  In general, it is strongly recommended to reconsider their actions in relation to information security risks.  You need urgent and tough measures. <br><br><h5>  If you are a user </h5>  remember the simple rules: <br>  upon receipt of such a letter: <br>  1. forward it to your information security / IT service <br>  2. Report to your correspondent who sent this letter about the danger and the inadmissibility of sending such letters. <br>  3. delete the letter <br><br>  Perhaps the question arises - who am I?  I am the Head of the Information Security Department in a large Russian company, on whose mail filters these letters of happiness ‚Äúsettled‚Äù.  After reviewing the contents, I estimated the scale of the problem and considered that only such a publication could attract enough attention to the problem. <br><br><h4>  Literature: </h4><br>  Panchenko A.
