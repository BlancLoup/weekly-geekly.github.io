This time I was able to participate in the Program Committee and can not just retell other people's words, but share my impressions. </p><br><p>  It will be very cool.  This JBreak promises to be almost the most balanced combination of hardcore, practice and smoothies.  Moreover, the reports are chosen so as to intersect as little as possible with the JPoint (it will be in a month).  For example, Nikita Koval will be on both the JBreak and the JPoint - but with two completely different topics.  This is important, for example, for those who want to go live on JBreak, and on JPoint - online. </p><br><p>  The reports are very diverse: if you want to plunge into the hell of the insides of the JVM, Chris Talinger and Volker Simonis will come to us - well-known experts on this very thing.  If you want to know about the future of Java, this is the report of Deputy Director Azul, Simon Ritter (although it‚Äôs not so easy there either - you‚Äôll have to plunge into a bunch of JEPs, release policies, modern platform development trends, and so on).  If you want to take part in an easy, bright, fast-paced show using trend technologies like Apache Kafka, Kafka Connect and KSQL - for this, Vitya <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/gamussa/" class="user_link">gAmUssA</a> Gamov is a co-founder and leader of the correct podcast ‚ÄúFlight Analysis‚Äù loved by many programmers. in the company Confluent). </p><br><p>  In order not to take my word for it, the main questions will be covered under the cut and the full JBreak 2018 program will be presented with a description of the reports and photos of the speakers.  At the very end of the article there will be a link to registration.  Go! </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="voprosy-organizacii">  Organization issues </h2><br><ul><li>  <strong>Everything passes right in Novosibirsk</strong> .  Even if you do not care about the cost of a plane ticket, does every employer let you go to Joker for a whole week in St. Petersburg?  Let's take it: a day to fly there and get in the hotel.  Two days of the conference.  Day to go back (4 hours of flight + 4 hours of time zone difference - this is immediately minus the day).  The risk that they will not let you go anywhere in the light of impending deadlines is great.  But JBreak takes place in Novosibirsk, and there is no need to fly anywhere. </li><li>  <strong>It will be a day off</strong> .  Many employers consider conferences to be nonsense and may well not let go on a working day.  But JBreak will be held on Sunday, so to hell with all these restrictions.  On Saturday, you can take a break from work, on Sunday, you can visit JBreak and dip into it with your head, and on Monday, you can begin tasks with fresh thoughts and new tools. </li><li>  Conference participants, of course, will be provided with <strong>videos of all reports</strong> , and very quickly.  If we perceive the conference as a real source of knowledge, then it would be madness to hope to remember so much useful information in one day.  Fortunately, we will have records. </li><li>  <strong>Ticket price is significantly less</strong> than at JPoint and Joker.  Approximately 3 times.  Of course, you need to consider that JBreak is only one day, and JPoint and Joker - two days. </li></ul><br><h2 id="voprosy-soderzhaniya">  Content issues </h2><br><ul><li>  On JBreak there will be not only simple light reports, but also <strong>powerful hardcore</strong> .  Such things that have real value, give a competitive advantage, make gyrus, whatever, move.  Something that is almost never delivered to the rare Novosibirsk Java mitap.  Want to know how to add new intrinsics to the JVM?  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ku4CMKcPbh0">To eat is served</a> .  (Report from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D5kB4CH_-eKQ%26list%3DPLVe-2wcL84b_iJvIflZu74vcyjezF6Fx9">one of the past JBreak</a> , this will be completely new reports). </li><li>  Among the speakers are not only our compatriots, but also world-famous foreign experts. </li><li>  Among our compatriots are Siberians, with whom it is quite possible to encounter one day on the street.  For example, Nikita Lipsky lives in Novosibirsk and works in Excelsior - these are the same dudes who wrote <a href="https://www.excelsiorjet.com/">their own JVM</a> .  Vladimir Plizga works in the CFT.  Lest it seem that this is a secret Masonic Novosibirsk lodge, there are people from other places: for example, Alexei Zinoviev is historically from Omsk.  Tagir Valeev ( <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/lany/" class="user_link">lany</a> ) this time does not make a report, but he will stand at the stand of JetBrains (and he also lives in Novosibirsk, works in JetBrains and does <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/specials/idea/idea.html">the same IDE</a> on which you write your code). </li><li>  The JBreak program committee is also largely Siberian; </li><li>  It will be possible to communicate with all speakers in special discussion zones.  Roughly speaking, after the report, each (!) Speaker is sent to a special place, where you can continue to torment him with complex issues.  About this I will write a little lower with a beautiful photo :-) </li><li>  JBreak is not a reduced copy of JPoint and Joker, but an independent conference with its own reports. </li></ul><br><h1 id="programma">  Program </h1><br><h2 id="jdk-9-mission-accomplished-what-next-for-javahttps2018jbreakrutalks1wep9lsitsywegsugs08uy">  <a href="https://2018.jbreak.ru/talks/1wep9lsitsywegsugs08uy/">JDK 9, Mission Accomplished: What next for Java?</a> </h2><br><p>  JDK 9, including the Java Platform Module System (JPMS), has finally come to a full release.  This report will begin with a quick introduction, which is to list the innovations of JDK 9 - how it will help Java developers and what kind of work we will have.  Oracle has made some important statements regarding the future of the JDK in general and Java EE in particular.  We will take a look at the proposed changes in the release rate, release naming scheme, on binaries using the GPL license.  It will talk about the model of LTS releases and how it will affect developers and administrators.  Finally, we look at the future of the Java platform as a whole.  There are many JEPs and OpenJDK projects, such as Valhalla, Amber, Metrololis and Loom - the report will also explain what all this means for developers. <br><br></p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8bc/1f7/218/8bc1f7218a21f462e9b55d013dd32708.jpg" width="200" align="left">  <strong>Simon Ritter</strong> </p><br><p>  Simon is the Deputy General Manager at Azul Systems.  He began working on information technology in 1984, receiving a bachelor of physics degree from the University of Brunel, in England.  In 1996, Simon joined Sun Microsystems and began working on Java version 1.0.  He spent his time both on developing the code itself and on consulting.  After buying Sun, he moved to Oracle and took over the management of a team of Java evangelists working on Java core technology, Java for client applications, and Java for embedded systems.  Now, while working at Azul, he continues to help people better understand not only Java as such, but also Azul technologies and products.  Simon was twice awarded the status of Java Rockstar at the Java One conference, and once - the title of Java Champion.  He now represents Azul on the JCP executive committee and on the Java SE expert groups (JSR 379 and JSR 383). <br clear="all"></p><br><hr><br><h2 id="create-effective-tests-or-create-excuses--testing-the-java-ee-wayhttps2018jbreakrutalks5olgdikllqssmio8m2mqgw">  <a href="https://2018.jbreak.ru/talks/5olgdikllqssmio8m2mqgw/">Create effective tests or create excuses - testing the Java EE way</a> </h2><br><p>  Testing is still a topic that most developers diligently avoid.  Despite the fact that testing is very important for getting really well-working software, developing and maintaining tests takes a tremendous amount of time and effort ‚Äî especially when changes in existing functionality cause testing scripts to change.  You could just throw away the tests, but this is a very bad decision.  This raises the question - how can we then write enterprise tests efficiently and productively?  This report aims to show what is needed to test Java EE applications ‚Äî efficiently, pragmatically, and of course, automated.  The report addresses such issues as obtaining fast feedback, sufficient coverage, predictable development speed.  All the time will be spent on livecoding test cases that will cover different spectra of functionality and use different technologies.  We will see how containers and orchestration frameworks can really help in testing complex and bulky applications.  In particular, we will clearly see how to develop well-supported test code, so that it continues to be high-quality and expertly written. <br><br></p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bf6/f4b/93e/bf6f4b93e657422ccc39782d1efa8ca1.jpg" width="200" align="left">  <strong>Sebastian daschner</strong> </p><br><p>  Sebastian Daschner is a Java technology consultant, author of books and articles, a trainer in various areas of development, actively involved in programming and Java (EE).

In fact, Graal already exists in JDK 9, according to JEP 243 (Java-Level JVM Compiler Interface).  Graal itself is written in Java, which adds new properties and features that were not previously available in HotSpot.  In this report we will see how to use Graal with JDK 9, how to build Graal from upstream and what you should look at when using it in benchmarks or, maybe, even in production. <br><br></p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a1d/17b/dd9/a1d17bdd9f86a4a902ccfe7e129661e1.jpg" width="200" align="left">  <strong>Christian talinger</strong> </p><br><p>  Chris Talinger is a developer working on various JVMs for over 13 years.

KSQL allows you to create complex systems for processing streaming data, without writing Java or Scala (sick!) Code!

Therefore, building systems assembled from loosely coupled microservices requires new strategies, both in terms of writing code and in data design.  One of the commonly used alternative strategies is Event Sourcing &amp; CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation).  In this report we will be able to get acquainted in more detail with the motivation behind the construction of such systems, and with the architecture of ES &amp; CQRS.  We will dive into a special demo implementation of ES &amp; CQRS, written entirely in Akka and Java.  Akka is a toolkit that provides the actor implementation of Event Sourcing &amp; CQRS, which essentially means that such solutions can be run on distributed clusters.  We will get acquainted with Akka Persistence and find out how other Akka features are used, such as cluster singltons and cluster sharding. <br><br></p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b2d/084/e5e/b2d084e5e2fcfd55234cbada38de8fcf.jpg" width="200" align="left">  <strong>Hugh mckee</strong> </p><br><p>  Hugh McKee works as a developer advocate at Lightbend.

Now he is committed to helping other developers discover the incredible opportunities that come with switching to a new set of principles: responsive, resilient, elastic, message-driven, etc. <br clear="all"></p><br><hr><br><h2 id="verifikaciya-java-baytkoda-kogda-kak-a-mozhet-otklyuchithttps2018jbreakrutalksrnonkzfgseamss6qqews4">  <a href="https://2018.jbreak.ru/talks/rnonkzfgseamss6qqews4/">Java bytecode verification: when, how, and can disable?</a> </h2><br><p>  Today, Java-developers are increasingly using libraries to generate Java bytecode in runtime for the effective implementation of various tricks that are difficult or impossible to express in the language of Java.  But if using the Java language, the javac compiler ensures that the output will be the correct Java bytecode, then going down to the level of the bytecode itself, you often need to independently monitor its correctness.  Otherwise, you will get jlVerifyError when loading the classes generated by you, because the JVM strictly monitors the correctness of the bytecode that it loads, using the Java bytecode verifier.  Thus, when generating bytecode, it is often not enough for you to simply know the semantics of bytecode instructions, you also need to know how the Java bytecode verifier works, which bytecode it considers correct and which it does not.  In this report, we will understand what mission in the JVM the bytecode verifier carries, when and how it works, whether it can affect the performance of your application and why it is dangerous to disable it. <br><br></p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ed3/1a9/0e4/ed31a90e4d2ddcf08a2c9923dc4394e2.jpg" width="200" align="left">  <strong>Nikita <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/pjbooms/" class="user_link">pjBooms</a> Lipsky</strong> </p><br><p>  One of the initiators and managers of the Excelsior JET project, a certified Java SE implementation developed by Excelsior.

Know you are not alone.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are a bunch of real-world problems, after which the test / debug code often leaves the production, turning into a time bomb, increasing the technical debt and spot on the developer‚Äôs karma. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the report, we will analyze the Side Effect Injection approach, which will allow you to embed almost any behavior into the application under test: delays, stubs, logging, security bypass, etc., but do not dirty the repository with dirty hacks or even reassemble the application itself. . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the course of the analysis, we will admire the Java code compilation options, pick up one bytecode modification case in the JVM, prepare the formal Java grammar, and then play with all this using the example of a real application.</font></font><br><br></p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1a3/955/bcf/1a3955bcf9d3363823c290b8db23c006.jpg" width="200" align="left"> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Vladimir Plizga</font></font></strong> </p><br><p>              :       SCADA-  .   6      -     ,         .        /  ,         ,      ,     . <br clear="all"></p><br><hr><br><h2 id="kak-generator-testov-pomog-stabilizirovat-kompilyator-v-zing-vmhttps2018jbreakrutalks5k5z74tftoey2kkecywcee"> <a href="https://2018.jbreak.ru/talks/5k5z74tftoey2kkecywcee/">       Zing VM</a> </h2><br><p>     ‚Äî  ,    Java-.    ,       .     ,      ,        .       ,      ?
