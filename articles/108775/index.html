  <section class="page js-page"><h1>China will have a network of "gas stations" for electric cars</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Not so long ago, there was news on Habr√© that large oil companies in the USA are developing a network of electric stations for electric vehicles.  It is the absence of such "gas stations", more precisely, charging stations, so far is a stumbling block in the issue of mass distribution of electric vehicles.  Of course, this is not the only problem, but it is still one of the main obstacles.  In some countries of Europe there are electric refueling stations, in the USA the stations are gradually developing, what about China?  Here, the development of electric stations is engaged in both the state and private business.  In this case, we are talking about the state company China National Offshore Oil. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  As the name implies, this is an oil company, and moreover one of the largest in this country.  It is worth noting that in China, often private business is keeping abreast of government programs.  This project is not an exception, which, according to the management of China National Offshore Oil, is one of the stages in the implementation of the state program, the purpose of which is the development of industry in alternative energy.  The network of charging stations, as planned, will be a hybrid - so, customers will not only be able to charge the batteries of their cars, but also change the discharged ones by charged, so to speak, instant charging.  Usually, such stations are either of the first or second type, but here we see a successful, sort of like, move by the Chinese. <br><br>  China National Offshore Oil does not just talk about its plans, it is already investing in the project.  So, recently, $ 732 million has been spent in a lithium-ion battery company for cars.  As a result, already at the end of this year, the first products will come off the conveyors of a new enterprise.  In general, the company works well, and it deals with a network of charging stations, and invests money in batteries.

      As for the USA and Europe, oil companies are also involved in such projects.  For example, Exxon Mobil is going to invest about a billion dollars in a similar project. <br><br>  I wonder if any of the state-owned oil companies of the CIS countries are going to engage in such projects?  For some reason, it seems that we will not hear about domestic programs of this kind very soon.  It's a pity‚Ä¶ </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108775/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108775/</a></p>
