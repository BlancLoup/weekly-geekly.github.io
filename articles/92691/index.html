The ultimate goal of each HackDay is to develop prototypes or working versions of new projects.  This time HackDay will be devoted to developments in the field of media and content.  It can be both <b>projects from the media sphere, and traditional IT projects</b> . <br><br>  <b>MediaHackDay</b> - this is the fourth event HackDay, the hallmark of which was the motto "from idea to prototype over the weekend."  At past meetings, the main focus of work was the creation of projects in the field of IT, and the weekend of February was given to the development of film and video. <br><br>  <a href="http://hackday.ru/registration.html">Registration of participants</a> <a name="habracut"></a>

      Three categories of participants are invited to MediaHackDay: <br><ul><li>  media professionals: journalists, editors, creators of magazines, media sites, blog authors, photographers, illustrators, Pr-specialists, internet marketers. </li><li>  programmers, designers and producers of Internet projects. </li><li>  technical and media students. </li></ul>  Work on projects will go in three main directions: <br><br>  <b>1. Production of media and art projects in new formats.</b>  The use of new and existing technologies in the media and online, the use of Twitter'a, Vkontakte, Facebook'a and other social networks and services in journalism.  Data creation and visualization, popularity ratings, infographics.  Launch new blogs, online magazines and TV channels.  Shooting pilot versions of new TV shows and TV shows, recording radio programs, audio and video podcasts.  Video installations, photo and art projects. <br><br>  <b>2. Promotion and work with Social Media</b> - creating content for viral distribution, creating popular videos, groups in social networks, twitter accounts.  Development and application of new advertising online technologies.  Development of marketing plans for promotion on the Internet. <br><br>  <b>3. IT-projects</b> focused on the collection, processing, presentation and consumption of content in all its manifestations, applications for mobile devices, e-books and tablet computers, projects for iPad, iPhone, Android and other mobile operating systems.  Interfaces for reading and sharing news, broadcast events in real time.  <b>We will be happy and IT projects that are not related to media.</b> <br><br>  The HackDay format was developed in Silicon Valley in 2005.  Now similar meetings of developers spread and are popular around the world.  At HackDay, you can come up with ready-made ideas, for the implementation of which they did not have time, and put together a team directly at HackDay, or you can join the finished one.  Finally, you can start participating from one of the master classes and create a new project based on them. <br><br>  HackDay is a place and time to work on real projects in the most creative atmosphere. <br>  It is important for us not only to hold a separate event, but also to provide participants with the opportunity to meet regularly and create more and more new projects in various fields: from IT and media, to movies and music. <br>  In addition, such meetings help expand the communicative capabilities of specialists in their fields and form an active community in St. Petersburg that will be able to implement the most innovative projects and ideas that most often arise at the intersection of areas. <br><br>  In St. Petersburg, each HackDay event becomes an important event, past meetings gathered <b>more than 300 active participants</b> , and <b>more than 25 completed projects</b> took part in the demofest.  The events are also widely reported in the media (reports on the First Channel and on the STO channel, materials in Business Petersburg, Chaskor and many other publications). <br><br>  MediaHackDay is intended as a platform for the implementation of innovative ideas in the field of journalism, online and mobile media.  Both <b>professionals and amateurs working with the media or having a relationship with media or IT projects are invited</b> to participate in MediaHackDay. <br><br>  The results of the participants ‚Äôjoint efforts will be: unique blogs, online and print media projects, magazine layouts, content projects, content collection tools for journalists and readers, Internet promotion tools, marketing and PR concepts, business plans, event concepts, art projects and much more. <br><br>  In addition to participating in the work on prototypes, <b>everyone will be able to share their knowledge and make a mini-report</b> .  Sessions of master classes will go parallel.  Performance format: 5 and 20 minutes. <br><br>  HackDay will end with demofest - an exhibition of prototypes and content projects created. <br><br>  Additional information on past events HackDay: <a href="http://hackday.ru/reports.html">hackday.ru/reports.html</a> . <br><br>  Those who have been to our previous three events already know that HackDay is an incredible atmosphere of creative adrenaline.
