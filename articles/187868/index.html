      With IE11, developers can use professional-quality video on sites, hardware-accelerated 2D and 3D web technologies, including WebGL. <br><br>  From today, all the benefits of IE11 are available to more than 700 million users of Windows 7. In addition, today we present an updated developer tool - <a href="http://www.modern.ie/">www.modern.ie</a> with free virtual machines and an online testing service for websites on all platforms. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Even faster and smoother internet </h3><br>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãis one of the most important qualities of a browser.  IE11 code is optimized to make sites appear as fast as possible, and web services run at the speed of applications installed on the computer. <br><br>  IE11 is the world's first browser that decodes JPG images in real time using a computer's graphics processor.  Due to this, the pages load faster, use less RAM - this helps to reduce power consumption and extend the battery life of mobile devices.  IE11 is also the world's first browser that uses a graphics processor to render text.  Text and images are the basis of the Internet, which means these two technologies will help you quickly display almost every page you visit. <br><br>  In order to load pages faster, the browser must be able to optimally choose the order of loading of the site elements.  IE11 is the first browser to use the <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webperf/raw-file/tip/specs/ResourcePriorities/Overview.html">W3C Resource Priorities</a> standard.  This means that developers can specify which page elements should be loaded first.  Support for the SPDY protocol, the basis of the HTTP 2.0 specification being developed, also speeds up the loading of some existing sites. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7d2/ad5/ed4/7d2ad5ed4095aa9a7cf35e29f42bc384.png"><br><br>  You can yourself evaluate the speed of IE11 with the help of new demonstrations on <a href="http://www.ietestdrive.com/">www.ietestdrive.com</a> .  Pay attention to <a href="http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Performance/Levitation/">Levitation</a> and <a href="http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Performance/LawnMark/">Lawnmark</a> : they allow you to estimate the speed of working with 2D and 3D graphics.  The markup display can be assessed using <a href="http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Performance/LiteBrite/">LiteBrite</a> as an example, combining the use of HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. <br><br><h3>  High performance javascript </h3><br>  The JavaScript engine ‚ÄúChakra‚Äù has undergone significant improvements.  It has become even faster, while maintaining compatibility with previous versions and a high level of security.  IE11 also supports the latest <a href="http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php%3Fid%3Dharmony:specification_drafts">ECMAScript 6</a> standard features described: let, const, Map, Set, and WeakMap, as well as __proto__ for compatibility. <br><br>  The JIT compiler now supports new optimization methods, including polymorphic caching (polymorphic cashing) of properties and embedding of functions, which means that more code passes through JIT and less time is spent on calculations.  Engineers working on Internet Explorer 11 focus on scenarios for working with existing sites.  Nevertheless, IE11 in JavaScript tests, such as WebKit SunSpider, continues to significantly outpace competitors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/77a/f9f/8c1/77af9f8c1da997e2cfdcfa12964e9847.png"><br><br>  In addition, IE11 uses the <a href="http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php%3Fid%3Dglobalization:specification_drafts">ECMAScript Internationalization API</a> (version 1.0). <br><br><h3>  3D hardware acceleration </h3><br>  Internet Explorer 11 supports WebGL, a new technology that will allow web developers to create websites with complex 2D and 3D graphics that are displayed using a computer's graphics processor.  The WebGL technology, which was previously used only for experiments, is becoming an important development tool, allowing you to create entirely new types of interfaces. <br><br>  For example, recently in partnership with <a href="http://www.glacierworks.org/">GlacierWorks</a> , an interactive website was created telling about the effects of climate change on the glaciers of the Himalayas, and about the effects of melting glaciers on the ecosystem.  Today we have updated this site by creating <a href="http://explore.glacierworks.org/en/">an interactive 3D map of the</a> Himalayas using WebGL.  This is a great example of how a 3D interface can interact with photo and video content that already exists on the site.  The site works on any device: for example, if you went to <a href="http://www.glacierworks.org/">www.glacierworks.org</a> from a tablet on Windows 8, you can appreciate another great IE feature: CSS device orientation, the ability to navigate a mountain range simply by taking the tablet in hand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/887/66b/2d5/88766b2d57fb84b0880b5967fbd47c2a.png"><br><br>  IE11 enables WebGL to work on any device with Windows 7 or 8, and can use GPU resources without compromising the security or reliability of the browser. <br><br><h3>  Professional quality video </h3><br>  Internet Explorer 11 allows you to use HTML5 video without additional plug-ins.  IE11 supports <a href="http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/HTML5/Captions/Default.html">closed captioning</a> standards ( <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2013/04/25/enabling-professional-quality-online-video-new-specifications-for-interoperable-captioning.aspx">TTML and SDP</a> ), so the videos you post on the site can be of the highest quality.  IE11 also supports the <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/fullscreen/raw-file/tip/Overview.html">HTML Full Screen API,</a> which makes it easy to deploy HTML5 video to full screen while watching.  IE11 can download videos without caching files on the hard disk, which helps to extend the battery life of devices. <br><br><h3>  New F12 Developer Tools </h3><br>  IE11 includes fully updated <a href="http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Browser/F12Adventure/">F12 developer tools</a> to help optimize sites.  IE team engineers worked on them together with the developers of Visual Studio.  With the new F12 tools, developers will be able to quickly obtain the necessary data to help optimize performance, diagnose errors, and get complete information on how IE displays the site. <br><br>  New F12 tools include: <br><ul><li>  UI debugging and memory usage diagnostic tool </li><li>  Live DOM Explorer and CSS inspection that updates information at the same time as the page, giving you the opportunity to evaluate the impact of dynamic content on markup and styles. </li><li>  JavaScript debugging - a tool that does not require page refresh </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0f7/4d7/d70/0f74d7d7075b903f2ebd072611ecf47c.png"><br><br>  It is also important that the F12 tools are in many ways similar to the usual Visual Studio tools.  Try the new F12 tools in the interactive review <a href="http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Browser/F12Adventure/">F12 Adventure</a> . <br><br><h3>  Everything that is already working will continue to work. </h3><br>  Internet Explorer 11 is fully compatible with existing sites.  It appeared API that will allow developers to make websites even better.  Also, some APIs have been changed and removed so that the websites that work now continue to be displayed without errors in new versions of the browser.  IE11 supports more HTML5 and CSS properties, such as enhanced 2D Canvas (anti-aliasing, padding, dashed lines), CSS border image, Device fixed positioning, Pointer Events and CSS Flexbox, mutation observers, and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/bg182636(v%3Dvs.85).aspx">more</a> . <br><br>  IE11 includes many other changes.  For example, the built-in text editor has been significantly improved:  It will be easier for developers to create applications that use text editors due to the ability to insert images from the buffer, undo actions, etc. <br>  A full overview of the new features in IE11 can be found <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/bg182636(v%3Dvs.85).aspx">here</a> .  And the IE team is waiting for your suggestions and wishes in <a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/ie">Connect</a> . <br><br>  However, keep in mind that IE11 has a substantially updated User Agent String. <br><br><h3>  Modern.ie update </h3><br>  Along with the release of Internet Explorer 11 Developer Preview for Windows 7, we updated the website <a href="http://www.modern.ie/">www.modern.ie</a> - a set of tools and materials designed to make website development (including IE) easier.  We want the Internet to develop, and we are doing everything possible so that developers devote more time to finding a new one, and not spending too much time on testing. <br><br>  So, from today on modern.IE: <br><ol><li>  Limited offer: 25% discount for Parallels for Mac. </li><li>  New virtual machines for testing IE11 for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 </li><li>  New free tool that allows you to get free screenshots of your site on most devices and browsers </li></ol><br><br>  In addition, the modern.ie website crawler is now available as open source (licensed under Apache 2.0).  You can download it from <a href="https://github.com/InternetExplorer/modern.IE-static-code-scan">GitHub</a> for your own projects. <br><br><h4>  Limited offer: 25% discount for Parallels for Mac. </h4><br>  Our friends at Parallels helped us in April by providing the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/02/microsoft-quickstart-kit-for-mac-developers-25/">Windows Quickstart Kit for iOS developers</a> and we were delighted with your reaction: everything was sold out in 25 minutes.

On Android, Safari, Xbox? </h4><br>  Visitors to your site can use a variety of devices.  Things like responsive Design can help developers create sites that look great on screens of any size.  But often web developers are forced to create different websites for different devices, without being able to buy all the new devices that appear on the market. <br><br>  We are pleased to present a simple testing tool that will show you in one click how your site looks on various popular devices.  The service is provided by BrowserStack.com.  Here is what <a href="http://www.modern.ie/">www.modern.ie</a> looks like on the screens of several popular gadgets: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a01/6fc/761/a016fc76110ad7f3a5b13260acf49c21.png"><br><br>  After receiving the screenshots, you can immediately add them to the real work of art created by <a href="http://www.chairmanting.com/">Chairman Ting</a> .
