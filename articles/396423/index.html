  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why startups fail</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Hello.  Today I want to touch on one sentimental theme - why many startups fail, even before they start.  This year I ran into at least three very large projects that were really interesting.  But they all died before they could begin. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In my last article, " <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/275068/">From Idea to Implementation. Part Three - Creating TK,</a> " I tried to explain how important a systems approach and planning is.  Today, I will say this again, and give a couple of examples. <br><br>  The first and most important problem that is not understood by both domestic and foreign customers is that programmers do not build the concept of your project, its ideology and architecture.  At the customer, it just does not fit in the head, as it generally can be.  This is explained, in principle, easily - 98% of customers have nothing to do with IT.  The concept of the process of creating a new project is not something vague, but in general, some kind of perverted.  Built on their own guesses, some stereotypes and personal inner understanding, as it seems to them, that life is arranged exactly as they themselves invented.  And most importantly, this is not possible to do anything.  It is impossible to convey to the person that this is not at all the way he imagines.  Attempts to bring the truth begin to tear down the fragile world of the customer, destroying all its illusions in the bud.  Therefore, many people do not want to look at the problem with a sober look and ruin their invented dreams, as soon as programmers give some half-hearted idea, tomorrow the customer will become a successful start-up and millionaire. <br><br>  The second problem, also important, is that the vast majority of customers cannot realize the fact that the Technical Task (TOR) is necessary for programmers to create the project itself, and not to calculate the cost of work and, accordingly, the budget.  I face this problem every other day.  A certain customer appeals to the development team so that they calculate the cost of the project.  As an explanation of the project, the customer is trying to convey his idea to the developers with beautiful speeches and active gestures.  And sincerely wondering why programmers send it to the system analyst.  Most often to me. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      And what happens in the end?  Instead of realizing the importance of the fact that the concept of a new project is the most important part, that without a technically sound approach, the project will be doomed, some customers are already trying to ‚Äúpull out‚Äù the cost of the project from me based on a couple of words about its coolness and necessity.  When they understand that they will have to invest in the development of TK, concepts, ideas and architecture, they try to look for anyone behind my back: even programmers, at least some freelancers, in general, it‚Äôs not even clear who will promise them to do a cool project without words documentation and for cheap. <br><br>  The third problem is a complete misunderstanding of the purpose for which a specialist is hired at all.  Intellectually developed people unequivocally understand that if they hire a high-level specialist, then you need to listen to what they are told and advised.  But this is the ideal.  And in everyday and cruel reality, the customer very often himself tells the specialist how it should be.  And even kill yourself, explaining that this is not correct, will lead to problems in the future, etc.  They say I'm a customer, I know better, do as they say to you (at this moment I remembered the wonderful comedy about the Bradley armored vehicle in the film "Pentagon Wars").  And here some contradictions come into effect: to lose a client or to spoil your reputation. <br><br>  The fourth problem is not understanding the golden rule of business.  If there is no money, then you should not start a business.  In the 90s such anecdote was relevant: ‚ÄúThere are two new Russians.  One says that he wants to buy a composition of stew.  And the second one says that he will sell it without any problems.  We agreed to make a deal in a month.  One went to look for a stew, the second went to look for money. ‚ÄùDecades pass, and the thinking of many does not change.  And if the sales and production business is at least already understandable to many, that if there is no money for it, then there‚Äôs nothing for people to endure the brain with their dreams, then in IT it‚Äôs not at all clear.  And thinking is about that.  After all, I can download any pirated software online for free.  After all, most of all CMS for free.  So what should I pay when creating my startup?  They say, 500 dollars will be enough for me to create my own social network, etc.  This is especially well fueled by all sorts of amateurish articles by young bloggers who tell us how they ‚Äúclimbed to the skies‚Äù using the self-installation of WordPress. <br><br>  The fifth problem is the sincere belief that with the help of standard software you can solve complex custom tasks.  I also meet this problem quite often.  Many people really believe that it is enough to buy some kind of program and with its help you can create your own startup or just make money.  For example, in one of the articles I wrote about the project of the Best-House real estate portal - ‚Äú <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/298184/">Start-up on my own. The history of the creation of the real estate portal</a> ‚Äù. So for him I wrote my unique parser for feeds of real estate agencies.  With that, he eventually became very complex and with an intelligent recognition system, logging and much more.  But some of my friends went the other way.  We bought a certain program (desktop), which does the parsing of some data and sincerely believe that this will work.  But while the real estate objects are 100, then parsing in semi-manual mode is easy.  But when there are hundreds of thousands of them, then you can safely put up a cross on your startup. <br><br>  There are actually many more problems, but I tried to outline the five main ones. <br><br>  So, let me down a certain outcome. <br><br>  1) To create your startup you need to very well understand the process of creating IT projects.  It is necessary to build a clearly structured plan, which will be divided into clear stages.  And go step by step, stage by stage. <br><br>  2) In order to estimate the budget of your project, you need to create a detailed ToR.  If you are not able to do it yourself, then you have to hire a specialist.  A competent specialist will take a lot of money for this.  For example, I charge $ 30 per hour for the development of documentation for a project.  A time may take from 50 hours to hundreds of hours, depending on the complexity of the project.  And this means that in order to understand your costs, you will still have to incur costs.  Here is such a vicious circle. <br><br>  3) If you do not have money for the project, then it makes no sense to twist and stir up something, trying to make yourself good for others.  Systems analysts, architects, project managers and programmers are no fools or idiots!  Many customers for some reason think differently.  You should not try to deceive people who, at least, are much more experienced than you.  If there is no money, then either look for a sponsor, investor, or forget about your dreams.  Nobody will work for free, or for a future share in the project. <br><br>  4) Do not try to make the project the same as the competition.  Even if you make it better, you simply will not be able to promote it financially.  I know what I'm talking about.  Make only unique startups. <br><br>  5) If you do not have a documentation package or, at best, you have some pages with interface and web page drawings, and contact immediately the programmers who immediately start working.  You know, you yourself have set check and checkmate.  What you yourself thought about the project, how it should be, and how you did it - these are two big differences.  You do not prove anything to anyone, and no one will listen to you. <br><br>  From the main, perhaps all.  Be responsible and pedantic.  There are no trifles in startups.  Do not rush and do not rush from the extreme to the extreme.  The owner Ali Express went 15 years to success, slowly and systematically.  Have a cold head and a warm heart - and you will succeed. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396423/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396423/</a></p>
