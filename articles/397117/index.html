  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Unevisable chips Sailfish OS</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, reader! <br><br>  Today I would like to highlight some of the unobtrusive Sailfish OS chips.  The article is more focused on users of Sailfish OS, but the "adherents" of other platforms, I hope, will also be interesting, they can appreciate the degree of convenience and the readiness of the system for the end user.  If you are ready, then go under the cut! <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f53/f11/3e0/f53f113e081a43568a8d0dc379e730b3.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Did you know that: </h4><br>  1. If you hold your finger on the application and turn the smartphone, the application will NOT change the orientation. <br>  Imagine by example: you were browsing the Internet from your smartphone while standing, then you decided to lie down (the orientation lock of the phone was turned off) so that the orientation did not change, just hold your finger on the screen while the smartphone changes its position in space.

      2. Double clicking on the hardware lock button unlocks your device and you immediately get to the Home Screen, bypassing the Lock screen. <br>  Please note that double clicking does not work if you have a password when unlocking. <br><br>  3. Since version 2.0.2, Sailfish OS has a call recording feature. <br>  To activate it, go to Settings (Applications) - Applications (Apps) - "Call Recording" (Call Recording). <br><br>  <b>Note:</b> <br>  In general, in Settings (Settings) - the Applications section (Apps), you can configure many applications authored by Jolla herself, as well as perform some actions on Android applications (clear the cache, stop the program, and so on). <br><br>  4. Double-pressing the lock button, if the phone is not locked, will lock the phone, followed by vibration, indicating that the phone is locked. <br>  Example of use: the phone is in your pocket and you are not sure if it is locked, but you don‚Äôt want to get it.  Then you just need to find the lock button and double-click until you feel the vibration. <br><br>  5. From the Tutorial application, you can exit immediately, for this, at the very beginning of the hour, click on the corners, starting from the top left. <br><br>  6. Since version 2.0.2, a simple out-of-the-box file browser has appeared, to find it, go to Settings (Settings) - Storage (Storage) - External memory / Memory card (User data) - swipe from top to bottom - File Manager option (File manager). <br><br>  7. Since version 2.0.2, it is possible to take screenshots, to do this, perform a half-second press on both volume buttons. <br><br>  8. For connoisseurs of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0">Semantic Web</a> : some technologies of the Semantic Web are used in Sailfish OS: <br><br><pre><code class="bash hljs">[nemo@Jolla ~]$ tracker- tracker-control tracker-info tracker-sparql tracker-tag tracker-import tracker-search tracker-stats</code> </pre> <br><br>  tracker sparql! <br>  In particular, the tracker is used by the media player. <br><br><h4>  <b>A couple of relatively obvious pieces, but for some reason some of them do not know:</b> </h4><br>  -in the Camera application, you can take photos simply by clicking on the volume carriage (though the application will not update the focus before the photo); <br><br>  -in the Camera application, you can adjust the zoom by bringing two fingers closer together on the screen and away from each other;  :) <br><br>  -in Settings (Settings) in the Gestures tab, it is nice to enable ‚ÄúQuick app closing‚Äù (to close the program immediately from top to bottom); <br><br>  -and, in gestures, you can turn on the svayp from left to right to get into the Events Ribbon (Events), instead of the Home Screen (Home); <br><br>  -If the phone is locked, then double-clicking on the screen will take you to the Lock Screen; <br><br>  - Change the wallpaper to your own picture only from the gallery.  To do this, open the picture in the gallery (Gallery), swipe from top to bottom, then select the option "Create atmosphere" ("Create ambience").  You will be taken to the atmosphere settings page, there you can adjust the colors to your taste or simply leave it as it is and rejoice; <br><br>  -in Settings (Settings) in the "Text Input" (Text input), you can enable the separation of the keyboard in landscape mode; <br><br>  - I advise you to put <a href="https://openrepos.net/content/basil/warehouse-sailfishos">Warehouse</a> - a client for Openrepos.  First, allow the installation of applications from unreliable sources: Settings (Settings) - ‚ÄúUntrusted Software‚Äù (Untrusted Software), then download the .rpm file from the link above and install it from the console or using the File Browser application.  Openrepos is a repository in which there are a large number of applications that are not in the Jolla Store for various reasons (for example, Jolla Store prohibits the use of demons, see the <a href="https://harbour.jolla.com/faq">FAQ</a> ).  Openrepos does not have QA, which carries some risks, but at the same time gives complete freedom to the developer. <br><br><h4>  Bonus </h4><br>  Several applications that may seem useful to you (in my opinion): <br>  - <b>SearchNemo</b> - search for files / specific text in text files across the entire file system; <br><br>  - <b>LLs vPlayer</b> (only in Openrepos) - an omnivorous video player with a decent amount of buns that are not in a regular player; <br><br>  - <b>Screen-message</b> - displays the typed text on the screen (for example, it can be used for notes); <br><br>  - <b>Sidudict</b> is a good offline dictionary based on QStarDict.  Minus: if you add a large number of dictionaries, the application crashes, or it takes too long to run, because each time you start, the dictionary is reindexed from scratch; <br><br>  - <b>File Browser</b> - an excellent file browser for Sailfish OS; <br><br>  - <b>Lists</b> - ToDo-organizer.  In my opinion, the author is very interesting to beat the functionality of the Cover (Cover); <br><br>  - <b>Lighthouse</b> - System Monitor for Sailfish OS; <br><br>  - <b>Battery Log</b> - an application to monitor the battery consumption, is able to build a graph; <br><br>  - <b>Unplayer</b> (only in Openrepos) - an excellent music player with the ability to play music directly from directories; <br><br>  - <b>Kat</b> - actively developing VK-client; <br><br>  - <b>Battery Overlay</b> - if it is unusual for you that the charge indicator is located only on the Home Screen (Home), then this application will solve the problem; <br><br>  - <b>Recorder</b> - voice recorder; <br><br>  - <b>Textractor</b> - OCR; <br><br>  - <b>TAO Translator</b> - client for Google, Yandex, Bing dictionaries; <br><br>  - <b>WiFi Analyzer</b> - view the number and power of WiFi networks; <br><br>  - <b>TinyEdit</b> - text editor with a minimum of functionality; <br><br>  - <b>Papocchio</b> - allows you to draw on the screen. <br><br><hr><br><br>  The Russian community Sailfish OS in <a href="http://sailfish.su/telegram">Telegram chat</a> helped a lot in writing this article. <br><br>  Thank you for reading this article, happy to use Sailfish OS and have a nice day! <br><br><hr><br><br>  <b>UPDATE</b> <br>  For those who want to see the saturation level of the Jolla Store, there is a recently appeared <b>unofficial</b> web directory: <br><br>  <a href="https://zhiz0id.github.io/josh/">zhiz0id.github.io/josh/#/josh</a> <br><br><hr><br><br>  <b>UPDATE2</b> <br>  <a href="https://releases.sailfishos.org/sources/">We posted the source code</a> version 2.0.2.51. <br><br>  To reduce disputes about the openness of Sailfish OS, <a href="https://wiki.merproject.org/wiki/SailfishOSS">open / closed package tables</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397117/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397117/</a></p>
