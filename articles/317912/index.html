  <section class="page js-page"><h1>As we on Habr√© survey about CRM conducted: results</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We have been developing CRMs for more than ten years and we write about five of them.  In our articles, we not only share our experience, but also rely on statistics and research.  All this time we have been sorely lacking statistics on the Russian market.  For foreign ones, as many as you want: from eminent agencies to corporate data.  What we found was either old or customized.  And there is no trust in this material.  Therefore, we took and conducted our first survey - to fill the bumps, understand how to conduct such research and accumulate statistics on CRM-systems.  For almost three months we collected the answers and now we are ready to share the results, conclusions and even our mistakes.  It was a rewarding experience, which gave a good analytics - we share with you. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/regionsoft/blog/317912/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5d3/357/1b9/5d33571b95dd06015ca88f69fb27176f.jpg"></a> <br>  <i>Source: stats.stackexchange.com</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We conducted a survey using Typeform.  Convenient service, but purely in English (although it scares anyone now!).  All links to the survey were placed only in posts on Habr√©, other sources were not included in the experiment.  Obviously, the posts on Habr get through search engines, but still the features of the site partly affected the results.  In the further study, we will cover at least three sites of different profiles plus our corporate website. <br><br>  423 people passed to the survey, 324 from a PC, 11 from a tablet, 84 from a smartphone, 4 from uncertain sources.  Of those who went to the survey page, 156 people answered questions, that is, 37%.  The average time spent by users on polling is 3.5 minutes.  We received the first answer to the questions on September 20, the last - on December 11, 2016.  <a href="https://nnnice.typeform.com/to/SZiKFe">We leave the survey</a> open so that everyone can go into it and see the structure - for educational purposes, so to speak, for this post.

    <h2>  <font color="#cc0000">The conclusions we made and the bumps we made</font> </h2><br>  Probably, it is not surprising that not a single sociologist was in the team of the vendor of the CRM system - even the marketer is a techie.  But the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe survey has long been ripe in our heads and it needed to be implemented so that both we and you have at least minimal industry statistics as of the end of 2016 and in Russia.  No sooner said than done.  Bugs and shoals, we began to realize later.  So, what <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">did the</a> company-developer <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">RegionSoft CRM</a> . <br><br>  <b>We feared for the number of respondents.</b>  When viewing foreign surveys and CRM / ERP panels, you can find the number of respondents on average from 50 to 300. This is a normal representative sample for users of corporate software.  In our wildest dreams, we thought about 100 respondents, got 156 - and this is very good. <br><br>  <b>We have been thinking about the structure of the survey for a long time</b> and as a result the grief from the mind has gone.  First of all, we found it unethical to question the age of the company and the number of employees, although what is criminal about this?  In the same way, we were afraid of the growth of the survey and threw out the question of the company's field of activity - now we are very sorry about this, because it is the affiliation to the industry that would shed light on a large number of self-written systems in the results. <br><br>  <b>In multiple choice questions, we have crossed some options.</b>  This did not affect the quality of the data, but added difficulty in processing the results.  If everything was designed correctly, we would not have to download the Excel file, manually normalize the data and analyze them to make sure that the graphs in the survey panel are correct. <br><br>  <b>We had similar or very similar answer options</b> , the difference in which is clear to us as the survey compilers, but could be incomprehensible to users.  For example, here: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7e5/4c4/6d1/7e54c46d17699f249ed793519c41cc25.png"><br>  Three selected answers correlate quite tightly.  But we still got the relevant, truth-like data. <br><br>  <b>We went to the experiment inside the experiment-survey</b> and decided to test how people go to contact.  The last three questions were aimed at communicating with the client. <br><br>  We asked if he would like more information from us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/36f/44a/13f/36f44a13ff07e201ec4f03105943dc72.png"><br>  <b>We offered to speak</b> in free form on 999 characters - complete freedom of expression.  And we got to the full: someone praised, someone cursed, someone honestly wrote that you need to fill in all 999 characters and filled them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4fa/482/edf/4fa482edfdd5b1ece4391d509969e732.png"><br><br>  A set of answers in the form of excellent mood and helps to draw some conclusions about the attitude towards CRM-systems in general.  And at the same time we wrote our comments to all answers in the spoiler - we are sure that the dialogue is useful, read.  And who asked, but did not leave contacts - get an answer. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">All questions and answers - under the spoiler.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> ‚û® Are there any examples of crm as a system of interaction with users of the holding (enterprise structure)?  In general, interest and methodological calculations on this issue.  Sd in my opinion, just a fixation, but if we consider the user as a client - interesting opportunities for management open up.  Thank! <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: we have a whole mechanism for working with holdings.</i>  <i>Paint it here will not work - this is a topic for a separate post.</i>  <i>Which, perhaps, sometime and write.</i> <br><br>  ‚û® We provide services, each time the cost is different, never repeats.  The person responsible for the implementation does not understand how to set up the system except for counterparty cards and contacts. <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: it‚Äôs not quite clear what you need from a CRM system and from which one ‚Äî ours or someone else‚Äôs ‚Äî we need to understand the structure of the software in question.</i>  <i>Write or call us if you need help.</i> <br><br>  We are at the implementation stage, so I cannot answer ‚Äúhas the situation changed after implementation‚Äù, but we hope!  :) And thanks for the interesting and instructive article!  :) <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: success in the project!</i> <br><br>  ‚û® Automation taxis!  ASUP <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: Definitely!</i>  <i>Automate everything, always and everywhere!</i> <br><br>  ‚û® The survey did not include CRM systems with event analytics (Carrot Quest, Intercom), which help accompany the client throughout his service.  And I want to quarrel that there are a lot of different systems, but not a perfect one :) All of them with different functionalities and reluctantly intersect with each other. <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: In fact, CRM is even more, but not everyone can actually meet.</i>  <i>And what, one of the vendors has created a system that does not allow accompanying the client during his service?</i>  <i>As for the ideal CRM, the question of adapting and building business processes is always in the hands of the company.</i> <br><br>  ‚û® Creating deals should be in 1 window (including an unlimited number of contacts), all communications with the client in another (not tabs !!!) <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: A matter of taste, there are different implementations.</i>  <i>Our customers usually note that tabs are very convenient in terms of use - everything is at hand.</i> <br><br>  ‚û® It is not clear how to convey the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe need for CRM to the leadership, far from IT-technologies. <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: Any management always has one goal - making a profit.</i>  <i>Usability, ergonomics and loyalty do not affect it.</i>  <i>Try (perhaps, together with the vendor) to prove productivity growth and its impact on future income.</i>  <i>Explain that CRM is not about IT, it is about operational sales support - in fact, an automatic sales person.</i> <br><br>  ‚û® So it turned out that I implemented several CRM.  The success of the implementation depends on the heap factor, but the main thing is the company's readiness for implementation, the presence of a ‚Äúsponsor‚Äù who will not only pay for the implementation, but also ensure that everyone uses. <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: Such a sponsor should be an intensively motivated leadership.</i>  <i>if the bosses "and so everything suits", they are difficult to break through.</i>  <i>CRM is a real investment in business development, and the company must be aware of the need for investment.</i> <br><br>  ‚û® Habit, inertia - this is what hinders implementation and use.  and still the lack of a concept in TOP what is CPM. <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: Absolutely accurate - the transition to an automated system always seems difficult.</i>  <i>In fact, everything is much simpler - we wrote about the problems of implementation, and the simple way to deploy a CRM system in the company.</i> <br><br>   We have no route sheets for delivery <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: And ours has one - this is just one of the cases when a special project made to order, successfully entered the release.</i> <br><br>  ‚û® Regionsoft, write more and more!  We read you the whole department.  Thank you for the clear and very professional texts.  it is immediately obvious that it‚Äôs not the PR man who is writing, but real engineers, just like us!  Keep it up) <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: Thanks for the feedback!</i>  <i>In the new year there will be interesting topics, we already have a plan.</i> <br><br>  ‚û® I need a killer feature <a href="https://toster.ru/q/255564">https://toster.ru/q/255564</a> <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: We are not very friendly with mobile phones yet, the system has a slightly different profile.</i>  <i>But we can make customized revision.</i>  <i>Price and terms - only after the preparation of the TZ.</i> <br><br>  ‚û® Any product requires finishing.  No system works out of the box <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: Not always, everything very much depends on the requirements and specifics of the business.</i>  <i>But improvements are common, yes.</i> <br><br>  ‚û® From your CRM pushes the interface load and the lack of good video manuals. <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: Our interface is not loaded, but functional and working.</i>  <i>If something seems superfluous, it can be disabled in the settings.</i>  <i>Video manuals will be, as long as we offer excellent and detailed documentation.</i> <br><br>  ‚û® Need your own CRM. <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: Good luck - this is a difficult, lengthy and costly process, but it will bear fruit.</i> <br><br>  ‚û® We need to teach users and explain to them that this is really important - this is the biggest problem! <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: Yes, often there is sabotage of CRM systems in companies, boycotting and other destructive actions - this is psychological resistance to the new.</i>  <i>Well, either in the team there is something to hide.</i>  <i>About overcoming implantation diseases we wrote here.</i> <br><br>  ‚û® CRM system for managers so that they can automate themselves. <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: No</i>  <i>CRM, above all, for employees who want to work quickly and efficiently, keeping things in order.</i>  <i>Managers usually use reports, track dynamics and KPIs.</i> <br><br>  ‚û® 1C - "amazing" thing. <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: Oh, and do not say!</i> <br><br>  ‚û® Wonderful <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: Immediately New Year's mood appeared.</i> <br><br>  ‚û® I have a cash gap, I can‚Äôt find adequate experts on elastix, they call me in finpol, I lost in the competition, my tooth hurts, I‚Äôm a household alcoholic, the client‚Äôs video surveillance server regularly drops, but I can sell your CRM in Kazakhstan, please write me on mail prices for the dealer. <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: You have a great self-presentation!</i>  <i>Anyone who wants to sell us in any region can write to dealer@regionsoft.ru</i> <br><br>  ‚û® Rather want valuable CRM <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">www.regionsoft.ru</a></i> <br><br>  ‚û® No comments <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: No comments</i> <br><br>  ‚û® A lot of things and not good. <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: In vain, that did not say more common - we are interested in the opinion of each adequate interlocutor.</i> <br><br>  ‚û® A very necessary system in business to save time and build management decisions. <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">www.regionsoft.ru</a> - praise more than complain.</i>  <i>And in our sales department and technical support, we see the effectiveness of RegionSoft CRM.</i> <br><br>  ‚û® Thanks for the link to typeform :-) <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: What would a good application and not popiarit!</i> <br><br>  ‚û® Make basic CRM solutions free. <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: We have already heard: "... factories for workers, land for peasants ..." It did not end well.</i>  <i>But seriously, there are expensive free open source CRM.</i> <br><br>  ‚û® I like to do everything myself :-) <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: Sometime around this same principle, our RegionSoft CRM began its existence.</i>  <i>But experience shows that sometimes it is better to use a ready-made solution - the division of labor is a really cool thing from the point of view of both the personal and the global economy.</i> <br><br>  ‚û® CRM is a relevant tool for modern business.  If you want your business to be modern and relevant, without the introduction of CRM - it is impossible to imagine. <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: Agree 100%.</i> <br><br>  ‚û® Poll so-so, we use several CRM for each department. <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: Well, the survey is so-so - we have already learned about this post.</i>  <i>The next one will be cooler, we are already working on it.</i>  <i>Using several CRMs for each department is also an idea for itself.</i> <br><br>  ‚û® There is no normal CRM in Russia. <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: Have you looked at all?</i> <br><br>  ‚û® Alas: (I do not want to quarrel <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: Well, right.</i> <br><br>  ‚û® Thanks for the articles on Habr√© <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: Glad to write useful things!</i>  <i>We are for the sensible and necessary content.</i> <br><br>  ‚û® The company understands that the phased implementation of boxed CRM with modifications was a mistake.  It was necessary to quit resources for completion samopisnoy.  And so for 3 years only stretch resources.  In fact, the vendor deceived about the need to paint only with the mouse.  &lt;vendor specified, but not disclosed for ethical reasons regarding competitors&gt; <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: Understand your problem, along with the rest of the answers, we sympathize with you.</i>  <i>Yes, the situation is difficult and unpleasant, professional notation of processes - this is not true for the mouse.</i>  <i>We in due time from them essentially refused in favor of the native graphic interface.</i>  <i>Talk to the vendor - maybe you can find a compromise.</i> <br><br>  ‚û® Dratuti <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: We do not want to follow memes, but they still climb into our lives!</i> <br><br>  ‚û® Hu * ta &lt;censor, otherwise we will be banned here&gt; <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: And on Habr√© you would be banned.</i> <br><br>  ‚û® param memory <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: I wanted to review a couple of issues of "Yeralash".</i> <br><br>  ‚û® Hello.  There should be no void in nature.  Therefore, I leave to you as a keepsake all nine hundred and ninety-nine characters: &lt;further remaining characters&gt; <br><br>  <i>RegionSoft: we are also for harmony in nature.</i>  <i>Saved to memory!</i>  <i>Like all the other notes.</i> <br></div></div><br>  <b>They offered to leave their email address</b> in order to arrange a presentation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6e0/ac5/28f/6e0ac528fcd1ea8a9feb233af598f06a.png"><br>  <b>Or write about yourself</b> in free form. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3c6/4de/c51/3c64dec511c5ffe1836b422cd5a0d9a8.png"><br><br>  Here in the last two points we did everything wrong.  First, you had to ask for the phone, because it is faster, the user expects less spam, immediately a constructive dialogue without wasting time on both sides.  If a person is motivated for the presentation and is interested in CRM, it is clearly easier for him to communicate in voice.  Although some insisted on letters and directly indicated this.  Someone refused, but wrote that he was afraid of spam.  Here we can assure you - the company Regionsoft never spam, we are extremely moderate in informing our potential and current customers.  Sometimes we are even told that this is wrong and we need to be reminded of ourselves more often, but we have our own view of relations with customers.  Although 19% of respondents left their data, we contacted everyone.  Not everyone answered, but contacts still happened.  Of course, it‚Äôs too early to talk about conversion.  We can not give a final recommendation to collect or not to collect leads in surveys, but perhaps we will try another form. <br><br>  Despite these problems, the survey showed relevant results, which turned out to be both interesting, and useful, and unexpected.  And most importantly, we have a base on which we can build a deeper and more professional research. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#cc0000">Hypotheses and results of a survey on CRM-systems</font> </h2><br>  So, we knew nothing about the logic and architecture of the polls, but knew about the rules of the experiment.  First of all, there must be hypotheses - assumptions that the respondents had to confirm or refute the answers of the respondents.  We built them according to our experience with our RegionSoft CRM and on the basis of long-term market surveillance. <br><br><ul><li>  Domestic CRM have more popularity than imported ones.  It seems logical to us, because the overhead of the introduction of Russian CRM-systems is lower, and this applies to the price, and adaptation, and training, and especially technical support and refinement. <br><br></li><li>  Users do not really need integration with chat rooms and social networks.  Many CRM implement these features and write beautiful press releases.  But it seems to us that this is not a matter of requests, but of wanting to be trendy and relatively simple APIs of some social networks. <br><br></li><li>  CRM automates more commercial service than the entire company.  Actually, it does what it was originally intended for. <br><br></li><li>  CRM has less than 40% of respondents.  In fact, the share of companies living without CRM is quite large, but it is unlikely that you will get a relevant answer on Habr√© due to the deep technical orientation of the project. <br><br></li><li>  The implementation gives a positive result.  Our experience confirms this, we hope, confirms the survey. <br></li></ul><br>  It is time to reveal the cards and find out which of the hypotheses were correct. <br><br>  <b>CRM-system is implemented</b> in half of the respondents.  In many ways, such a high proportion is due to the specifics of the site - among Habr's readers there are many employees of companies with a high level of automation.  Another hypothetical reason - it is not known what lies behind samopisnymi CRM.  This will be a new stage of our research. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a56/873/a45/a56873a45d8d24763ab95e3a46869602.png"><br><br>  <b>What CRM is introduced or planned for implementation in the company</b> is the first part of the survey, which caused a hundred questions for the future.  This is how the answers were distributed: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b42/037/2ed/b420372ed5a50d2d4b764cbed6105d2c.png"><br><br>  32% - self-written systems, this is an unprecedentedly high figure.  On the one hand, again, this value may be due to the specifics of Habrahabr.  On the other hand, it is important to understand what is meant by self-written CRM: integration projects for 3-5 million rubles, Google for Business, open source forks, simple self-written contact stores, Excel sheets with macros.  All these options can not be excluded, and in the future you need to more thoroughly study. <br><br><blockquote><hr>  By the way, all December we give discounts on <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">RegionSoft CRM</a> and all software of our own.  Today - <b>10% discount</b> and cool terms of installments and rent.  Tomorrow will be -9%, and so on the downside.  We do not have -70% and -90%, because we keep the economically reasonable price for the license, and do not take it from the ceiling.  Details on the <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/loader.php%3Fsrc%3Ddiscount/discount_ny">site</a> . <br><hr><br></blockquote><br>  Let us leave the mysterious self-written systems for the future in such quantity, let us turn to the delivery options: 39% of respondents chose server systems, 25% chose cloud systems.  Honestly, we didn‚Äôt even have a hypothesis that the server would bypass the cloud by as much as 14%, but now, based on the analysis of the systems themselves and other details, it becomes clear that there are prerequisites for this.  Among which the first place belongs undividedly to security, and the second to the cost of ownership.  Well, yes, the hypothesis was confirmed - 45% of the Russian systems, and with the samopisnymi - all 77%.  This pleases us primarily because users are aware of how much more advantageous domestic solutions are both in terms of the basic set of functions, and in terms of learning and communicating with vendors. <br><br>  <b>What is your current / future CRM called?</b>  It seems that the question is simple, but there are obvious surprises in the second part of the table - we will not comment for ethical reasons, judge for yourself.  Index RegionSoft CRM - 4%, 5 users.  Of those who got to another, it is worth mentioning vTiger open fork, which got into the survey 4 times, once Siebel and Microsoft Dynamics CRM, 1C: UPP, twice Google, once IQ300, Retail CRM, OneBox, Pipedrive.  By the way, there are only three errors in attributing systems to the cloud or server. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ebb/7b5/5c7/ebb7b55c795699ffe2a816ea87bc07ee.png"><br><br>  <b>Which units use / will use CRM in your company?</b>  In the answer to this question (multiple answer), sales and top management are expectedly leading.  Indeed, CRM-systems were initially created as a tool for sales management, and then they were overgrown with a concomitant set of functions, and the line between them, project management systems, and sometimes ERP, became blurred.  I was surprised by 21% of users from the IT service - however, we more than anyone know that CRM, if desired, easily works both as a tool of technical support and as a bugtracker and incident management system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ffb/f5a/539/ffbf5a53978808468995b8dfe1453d31.png"><br><br>  <b>What do you most often use / intend to use in CRM?</b>  Absolutely predictable top answers: contacts, clients, tasks, projects, schedulers, business processes, documents.  A predictable 7% for social networks and a completely sudden 26% for telephony and 15% for a Gantt chart.  And if the Gantt chart in the form in which it offers fashionable simple project management systems, is successfully replaced by planners and group planners, and we have not reached the industrial Gantt, then such a low percentage of telephony is a sudden result.  Integration of virtual PBX, merging of CRM and telephony is a huge resource for the development of commercial services.  For example, we have it so in demand that we even had to make our RegionSoft VoIP Connector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/25f/60d/b53/25f60db5306375677e3110f423d2b8dc.png"><br><br>  <b>Question: how do you think how fully used CRM?</b>  The result is nothing unexpected. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/160/9b8/026/1609b80269254c87e95cba4588111325.png"><br><br>  But we remember that in our survey there are those who have not yet implemented a CRM system and who have already implemented it.  Let's see the details.  Of those who have already implemented, 31% use the system in half, 36% consider CRM as a stronghold of commerce and use it actively, 18% as a corporate portal, 6% - after being kicked by their superiors.  Of those who plan, the answer ‚ÄúI don't know‚Äù prevails, in second place - for the success of commerce and as a corporate portal.  Quite adequate expectations from a CRM system. <br><br>  <b>Which integrations are important to the company?</b>  Who is the leader here? Obviously, CRM loses a lot without integration with accounting, just like the other way around.  Therefore, 1C got 55%.  Telephony is in second place (!) - here there is a doubt - is it because such a small percentage of telephony is higher, that not all systems, especially self-written ones, are able to integrate with it?  Quite paradoxical 27% with CRM and ERP, although we sometimes encounter software zoo in the same company at work.  We only note that this is extremely bad and slows down the processes due to weak integration capabilities and the lack of end-to-end business automation.  By the way, such integration with other CRMs is necessary in 33% of cases of technical workers who work with cloud-based CRM systems and in 19.6% of cases with server ones.  It is no coincidence - the listed server CRM most often either have ERP-level functionality or their own warehouse management systems and production management systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/554/a17/1d1/554a171d1bf92889405dc343eab6249a.png"><br><br>  <b>Has the situation changed after the introduction of CRM?</b>  Here, the actual impressions of those who have already implemented, and the expectations of those who are to be implemented, approximately coincided, with the difference that those who already use it have become better not by 43%, but by all 56%.  Assessing the changes after the introduction of CRM is necessary - to understand how effective it is and what measures you can take in the future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fe6/319/621/fe6319621d1c3f241eca2e506fb85f69.png"><br><br>  Only 18% of respondents do not plan to introduce CRM. <br><br>  The survey showed that CRM systems are in demand by businesses, companies are interested in implementing and working for a positive result.  As the general trend shows, the most popular features are connected with the organization of the client base, task management and planning. <br><br>  Thanks to everyone who participated in the survey, called, wrote in the chat and social networks.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With this post, we are completing our 2016 on Habr√© and are preparing new topics in 2017 - about developing, implementing, working with clients and much more. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It‚Äôs too early, but all the same - all with the coming one!</font></font><br><br><hr><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Poll, another poll </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> After the publication of our previous post on Habr on Facebook, we received such a comment from a student. </font></font><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9c7/46d/926/9c746d9266d5588e83d3dc478bf9fb7e.png"></div><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He wrote us in private messages and we got to know each other better - the young man collects data for his master‚Äôs thesis and developed his own survey on the impact of software on the team‚Äôs effectiveness. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We asked to present the results after the defense on Habr√© - but this is his case, and we ask you to go through the survey and help the future master - remember, as always, the practical part of the diploma is going hard. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By the way, questions and structure are well made. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚Üí </font></font><b><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe7N-R4K_LVSYbaf2zsXKeh6_SgwfQrzH56Eh6-L4-aY0itUA/viewform"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Link to profile</font></font></a></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/317912/">https://habr.com/ru/post/317912/</a></p>
