We will talk about our experience and discuss it with market experts.  And also we will share a couple of free services that will help you apply everything described below in practice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b90/54f/b2c/b9054fb2c0cd402bac074726a1fa6886.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Note that it will not be about all the headlines that appear on the site, but only about the most important thing.  About that which is allocated as H1.  About the title that the visitor sees when he first visits the site.  About the title, which is intended to interest a potential client, so that it becomes interesting to examine the contents of the page, rather than close it immediately.

Therefore, these companies look the same in the eyes of consumers and use only discounts and promotions for detuning from competitors.  At this fantasy ends.  USP?  No, did not hear.  Owners of such companies, even for a million dollars, will not tell the secret, how do they differ from competitors.  And it's not a trade secret ... <br><br>  Therefore, to increase conversion, we strongly recommend combining the main title with the use of UTP.  But how to make such an effective design? <br><br><h3>  <b>Method one - 4U formula.</b>  <b>Or, as we call it, <a href="http://blog.meedget.ru/4u">HIPS</a></b> </h3><br>  It consists of four components, placed in random order: <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  1U Usefulness </td><td>  Utility and Benefit </td></tr><tr><td>  2U Urgency </td><td>  Urgency and limited supply </td></tr><tr><td>  3U Ultra-specificity </td><td>  Specificity of the offer </td></tr><tr><td>  4U Uniqness </td><td>  Uniqueness </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  An example on the site for <a href="http://krovlya-kryshi.com/">roofing</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/365/946/bee/365946beed0940cf8b98eb234085a4a5.jpg"><br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúWe repair the roof and facades the fastest by German technology with a 5-year warranty‚Äù </blockquote><br>  Consider the result: <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  1U Usefulness </td><td>  We repair the roof and facades </td></tr><tr><td>  2U Urgency </td><td>  Faster than all </td></tr><tr><td>  3U Ultra-specificity </td><td>  With 5 years warranty </td></tr><tr><td>  4U Uniqness </td><td>  According to German technology </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  <i><b>Effect</b> :</i> <i><br></i> <ul><li>  Reducing the number of failures from 24% to 19%. </li><li>  Lead growth - 14%. </li></ul><br><br>  We even made a <a href="http://blog.meedget.ru/4u/">simple service</a> that helps to make headlines using the 4U formula.  Everyone can try to improve their headlines in a few minutes. <br><br><h5>  <b>What did Denis Kaplun advise us to enhance the headlines?</b> </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bd8/ab1/2af/bd8ab12af944458089d9dd724a6f7075.jpg" align="left"><br>  <i><b>Denis Kaplunov</b> is one of the most famous and brilliant copywriters in Russia, the founder of the Denis Kaplunov Studio.</i>  <i>He received two higher education - legal and economic.</i>  <i>Seven years working in a commercial bank, where he urged customers about the benefits of cooperation.</i>  <i>The author of the best-selling "Copywriting of Mass Destruction", "Effective Commercial Offer", "Content, Marketing, and Rock and Roll" and the new book "Business Copywriting: How to write serious texts for serious people."</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>It advises to strengthen the headlines with the help of "magic" words:</i> <i><br></i> <ul><li>  New (new, new, news) - will never become obsolete, will be of interest and uniqueness. </li><li>  Free - not everywhere it is possible to use this word, but its power is beyond doubt.  Freebie, sir;) </li><li>  A word that identifies the target audience (profession, age, income, hobbies, problems, gender, etc.). </li></ul><br><br>  Another trick is the allusion.  To do this, beat <br>  famous catchwords or names.  For example: <br><br><ul><li>  The main instinct of content marketer. </li><li>  Check seven times, publish once. </li><li>  50 shades of gray content marketing. </li></ul><br><br>  And one more example is to add a date or a year to the title, this will add relevance to the topic. <br><blockquote>  For example: "How to make money in 2015?" </blockquote><br><br>  Denis draws attention to the task of the title to immediately ‚Äúcement‚Äù the attention of Central Asia.  Improving the quality of the target audience, you increase the text conversion. <br><br><h3>  <b>Method two.</b>  <b>Principles of Bligh</b> </h3><br><br>  Headers must satisfy four principles: <br><ol><li>  Attract attention. </li><li>  Segment target audience. </li><li>  Disclose the essence of the proposal in its final form. </li><li>  Draw the reader into the text. </li></ol><br><br>  An example on the website of <a href="http://vodoteplomontazh.ru/">water heating</a> services <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/af0/5cb/e7e/af05cbe7e3a048c290d4fffe7f2de5cf.jpg"><br><br><blockquote>  "Where to order a reliable installation of communications, so that 5 years is guaranteed to enjoy home comfort?" </blockquote><br><br>  Consider the result: <br><ol><li>  Attracted attention at the expense of "5 years warranty." </li><li>  Target audience - people who want to enjoy home comfort.  We intend to abandon the clear indication of "owners of houses and apartments" during segmentation.  This complicated the design. </li><li>  Uncovered the essence of the proposal in its final form - "reliable installation of communications." </li><li>  Tightened into the text with the question and utility.  Here we explain an important, but non-obvious point: the human brain always requires an answer to a question.  If there is no answer, the brain immediately starts searching for information.  Therefore, the question headings on the principles of Bly - a win-win. </li></ol><br><br>  <i><b>Effect</b> :</i> <i><br></i> <ul><li>  Reducing the number of failures from 18% to 13%. </li><li>  Lead growth: 16%. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  <b>What did Dmitry Kot offer us for segmentation of the target audience?</b> </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9fb/f2f/cfe/9fbf2fcfe00841aca36a53792882f982.jpg" align="left"><br>  <i><b>Dmitry Kot</b> - director of the Agency selling texts.</i>  <i>Copywriter with the education and marketing approach.</i>  <i>Personal record - text with a conversion of 20% - every fifth reader becomes a buyer.</i>  <i>Author of the bestseller "Copywriting: how not to eat a dog.</i>  <i>Create texts that sell. ‚Äù</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Try to make the headline not attract all readers, but only potential customers.</i>  <i>In other words, that it is of interest only to the people you need.</i>  <i>To do this, use the title:</i> <i><br></i> <ul><li>  Professional terms.  For example, "How to increase CTA 2 times?"  Those who are not in internet marketing pass by. </li><li>  Professional slang or jargon.  For example, "5 subtleties of two-step sales."  Read the texts of those who are in the topic of sales in 2 steps. </li><li>  The names of the experts in this market.  For example, ‚ÄúWhat did Linus Pauling really discover?‚Äù Those who are not related to biochemistry pass by. </li><li>  Mention specialized brands.  For example, "Secrets of installing Brembo on the E-class."  Open only mechanics and owners of the E-class. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  <b>Other ways to write titles</b> </h3><br><br>  We clarify once again that there is no one valid formula for an effective title.  This also applies to the number of words and its formula.  There are simply successful viral headers, tightly attracting attention and quickly selling text. <br><br><h5>  <b>Pavel Berestnev shared with us the technique of quickly developing effective headlines:</b> </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9e5/d82/370/9e5d823702474d0882be47a4739f8b8d.jpg" align="left"><br>  <i><b>Pavel Berestnev</b> is one of the most famous and successful copywriters of Runet, the head of the Copywriting League.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Recommends using brute force combinations of cards with pasted headers.</i>  <i>To do this, a copywriter pre-collects the most "catchy" headlines from newspapers and magazines.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>No crisis of thought!</i>  <i>Play with such cards and get 10-15 ideas for an effective headline as a result of a quick search.</i> <br><br>  We use an open and truthful approach - when everything is clear from the title.  But there are other technologies.  They are based on the strong interest of the user to quickly find out what is there in the text?  That is, the task for 5-6 seconds to sell the reading of the main text, such headlines solve no worse than the ones presented above. <br><br><h5>  <b>What did Vic Orlov advise us on using NLP techniques in copywriting and sales?</b> </h5> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a7/d59/0a5/6a7d590a564347f1918b2533cc9f531e.jpg" align="left"><br>  <i><b>Vick Orlov</b> is the most extraordinary in RuNet professional in the field of modern psychotechnology on influence in PR, sales, and advertising.</i>  <i>Certified in NLP, provocative communication, EST and Eriksonian hypnosis.</i>  <i>He has spent over 20 years studying the secrets and laws of influence, having analyzed dozens of existing official and undocumented psychotechnologies and techniques.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Suggests the use of the "Alvio Collection" for the compilation of headings.</i>  <i>These are ready-made schemes, most of which are based on the use of NLP techniques.</i> <br>  The methods are working and different.  But it‚Äôs up to you to use the ‚Äúgypsy shock‚Äù technique on your potential clients or to spare them. <br><br><blockquote>  For example, the ‚ÄúSemiimpertiv‚Äù technique is a sharp shock message and an order to do something: ‚ÄúThief of traffic on the pages of your sites!  Get rid of him immediately! ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br>  Other schemes are more "humane."  For example, how else would the title of this article look like: <br><ul><li>  Headline-problem: "Your advertising costs exceed the revenue from the site?" </li><li>  Headline benefit: "4 words that will increase the income of the site owner by 47%." </li><li>  Emotion headline: ‚ÄúAgain, the advertising budget was merged on traffic and did not see the lead?‚Äù </li><li>  Headline rating: "4 ways to increase sales on the site, which you will not hear from marketers." </li></ul><br><br><h3>  <b>Application tips</b> </h3><br><br>  If your site has been running for a long time, there are hundreds and thousands of pages on it.  Rename all their headlines - death like.  This is not only labor, but also an unpredictable reaction of search engines.  Why risk changing positions in the issue? <br><br>  If you noticed, the headings that we made are tightly intertwined with the USP.  And now the main feature is that we generate one UTP heading for all pages of the site and place it above the real headline H1 of the page in plain text. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6c5/7c2/f54/6c57c2f5444e4fafb5fc68bde84618d4.jpg"><br><br>  Now you own a tool like writing effective headlines.  Generate headlines on the online service, place ready UTP on the site and increase profits. <br><br><h5>  <b>How does Sergey Bernadsky advise us to check the finished headlines?</b> </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/95c/a7a/232/95ca7a2327584821a71763a158136026.jpg" align="left"><br>  <i><b>Sergey Bernadsky</b> is a professional copywriter, business consultant and author of five successful business books, including the bestseller ‚ÄúMarketing texts.</i>  <i>How to turn the reader into a buyer.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Recommends initially to be at least 10-15 options for titles.</i>  <i>To get a good result, you need to ask yourself and get positive answers to two questions:</i> <i><br></i> <ul><li>  <i>Does your headline lead you to read the text?</i> </li><li>  <i>If you take</i> </li></ul>  <i>just one heading and append a phone number - will customers call?</i> <br><br><h3>  <b>What to do after you dragged the reader into the text?</b> </h3><br><br>  Be responsible for the words and benefit people.  For example, they promised to tell you how to increase sales using headlines ‚Äî do it.  And attracting potential customers, do not forget to effectively increase the conversion, including <a href="http://meedget.ru/">through our service</a> ;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/287050/">https://habr.com/ru/post/287050/</a></p>
