The main advantage is the ability to add additional contact details, descriptions and photos, which will be ranked according to users' votes. <br><br>  <b>Question:</b> Where will you look for the first content? <br>  <b>Answer:</b> For this we will hire several editors who, based on open sources, will collect the primary description of the objects. <br><br>  <b>Question:</b> How will you deal with cheating and unfair polls <b>?</b> <br>  <b>Answer:</b> A system will be created for voting to track markups, if a large number of simultaneous comments appear on a particular object, the object is quarantined and examined by moderators. <br><br>  <b>Add.</b>  <b>Info:</b> Speaker: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/vseznaut/" class="user_link">vseznaut</a> , <a href="http://vseznaut.ru/">Everyone</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/vseznaut/" class="user_link">Knows</a> <a href="http://vseznaut.ru/">.</a>  <a href="http://vseznaut.ru/">Ru</a> . <br>  Always happy to any suggestions, constructive criticism, and just contacts with good people. <br><br><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/miftahovn/SLTvmQK4g2I/AAAAAAAADGY/tQ5Hvmx6kPA/IMG_2537%282%29.JPG?imgmax=400"><br><br>  <b>VeryHochu.ru</b> - social network based on wish lists. <br><br>  <b>Idea:</b> Wish lists allow you to keep records of your desires, gift ideas for the holidays, which helps your friends quickly decide on the question ‚ÄúWhat to give?‚Äù. <br>  For this purpose, the site has a wide functionality: drawing up a wish, booking a wish, the opportunity to set an anonymous question, thank you for fulfilling a wish, choosing a gift idea, frendaning, correspondence, comments, special accounts for newlyweds, a calendar of events, a reminder about holidays of friends, import / export wish lists and contacts. <br>  A ‚Äúkiller feature‚Äù of a startup is integration with online stores and the subsequent possibility of buying goods specified by the user‚Äôs desire. <br><br>  <b>Question:</b> What is the way to monetize? <br>  <b>Answer:</b> There are several ways.

It doesn‚Äôt matter to the user whether the resource has paid for its availability or not, he is interested in finding all the offers of the product he is interested in (websites do not pay search engines for issuing them, and this is one of the basic principles of search engines).  Our service will search for online stores and collect information about all existing products in one place with a more user-friendly interface.  At the moment, we are focusing on the Western Internet. <br><br>  <b>Question:</b> How will you find stores? <br>  <b>Answer:</b> We will select the main hundreds of stores and keep them up-to-date manually - in this way we will collect a base of goods, and for each of them we will search for other stores containing this product using different methods.  The corresponding algorithm is being developed. <br><br>  <b>Question:</b> All stores have different templates, how are you going to parse them? <br>  <b>Answer:</b> We have created a solution that allows using the interface to create a template for the site, determine the change in store design, and be resistant to minor changes to the HTML code of the pages.  Our template builder allows you to add a new site for parsing in 20-60 minutes, depending on the complexity of the page, and does not require special knowledge. <br><br>  <b>Add.</b>  <b>info:</b> Speaker: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/hizhina/" class="user_link">hizhina</a> , Urla yet. <br><br><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/talykov/SLBR_5LPUbI/AAAAAAAAA0o/kCxEN-DxYs0/P8230007.JPG?imgmax=400"><br><br>  <b>WAPTalk</b> - messaging service <br>  <b>Idea:</b> Browser Messaging, First <br>  queue in the mobile.  Reduces the cost of SMS, does not require installation, <br>  as clients of ICQ and Jabber and do not need to remember the new account number <br>  records - the user to communicate is called by phone number. <br><br>  <b>Question:</b> Who are your users and where are you going to attract them from <b>?</b> <br>  <b>Answer:</b> Use our service will be people who did not put on <br>  phone mobile messenger clients or do not know about their existence <br>  or simply can not deliver, but already know what a mobile <br>  Internet and go to the portals of operators.
