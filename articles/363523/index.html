In other social networks, this form of government is not so obvious, but it is also present in slavery, as, indeed, in Apple Store or Google Play (there is at least an opportunity to earn a little, although they can punish for the slightest manifestation of discontent). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Here the author should deviate from the main topic in order to clarify the words ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù, ‚Äúdemocracy as a form of government‚Äù and ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù as a abbreviation for ‚Äúdemocracy as a form of government‚Äù or simply ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù. <br><br>  Until now, it is believed that the word democracy denotes the power of the people and this or that form of government in which this power is realized, and when they use this word, it means this very meaning.  However, this meaning is obsolete and does not at all reflect the essence of the phenomenon that is currently hidden under this word.  ‚Äú <s>From love, funny diseases happen, for anecdotes,</s> ‚Äù from which incidents <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/241712/">such</a> as this happen, where a person was punished for expressing dissatisfaction, and at the same time they asked why it was democracy.  However, the same confusion occurs with other words, for example with the word "power", but this, ebzh, perhaps, I emphasize, <u>perhaps</u> , we will consider later and perhaps, in another place.

      Let us first try to determine what we mean by democracy today.  The word democracy today denotes a form of government in which virtually any manifestation of discontent will be punished (in one form or another, perhaps even in the form of popular (rather a crowd) discontent) and is also called democracy. <br><br>  Moreover, to go to the White House and say ‚ÄúPresident is a fool‚Äù is not an expression of discontent, it is a discharge of negative emotions in the form of an expression of discontent and, of course, will not be punished.  However, a reasoned action against negative phenomena is and will most likely be punished (the author suggests examples of his readers to find on their own and, thus, show the author that his opinion of his readers is not about stupid cattle justified, especially since it‚Äôs easy (remember Google's cache remembers everything)). <br><br>  Returning to the topic of the business model of slavery in the application to IT, it should be said that the overwhelming number of IT resources earns on user-generated content and on viewing this content by readers, but does not pay for the work either to authors or readers, although this is hard work.  And if in the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù slave-owning society it was supposed to feed its slaves and provide them with housing, then in the case of IT this does not happen.  Instead, the slave is invited to feed and provide himself with housing on his own, and, on occasion, to say with pride: "I do not earn my living by this." <br><br>  In general, summarizing my view on the monetization of blogs through the use of slave labor, I consider this approach to monetizing IT as harmful and worthy of condemnation.  However, I‚Äôm not going to use this article to initiate the outcome of authors and readers from Habr or Facebook, similar to the exodus of Jews from Egypt (although everything is possible), because I love Habr and the benefits of it exist for me (I hope that the first ), although from love (but see above), but as honest people, the owners of such resources should think about the remuneration of their authors and readers for their <s>slaves</s> (but not limited to such (someone can only view pictures, due to young age or other reasons));  In general, "divide everything" equally, and grief and joy. <br><br>  A bit of recursion: As an experiment, this article will be published on Habrahabr, but, of course, not limited to this resource (let's not forget about the open source, of course). <br><br>  And yes, unlike businessmen from IT, I cannot pay my readers for reading this text otherwise than locally elevated mood and perhaps the realization of some simple truths, and if, for one reason or another, someone cannot accept this fee ( because it‚Äôs usually not difficult to accept money, the universal equivalent, <s>xxxx,</s> what to do), then we can discuss what to do (although there are few options, I‚Äôm just warning you and not everyone will do it, but I don‚Äôt insist). <br><br>  PS I love you. <br><br>  PPS And yes, I would consider participating in the mentioned projects as a work on a voluntary basis for the benefit of society, if the owners of these projects would ride the same bicycle as their, um ..., employees.  (By the way, most, uh ..., workers can be ‚Äúcalculated by IP <s>and on ...</s> ‚Äù and see what they are driving). <br><br>  PPPS Epigraph # 2 is called an honest business and it also amazes (I don‚Äôt like this phrase myself). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363523/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363523/</a></p>
