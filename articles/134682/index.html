In the next few years, this standard became the only one supporting the symmetric 10G-PON technology. <br><br><h6>  IEEE SIEPON Standard </h6><br>  Local operators and equipment manufacturers are the main initiators and founders of the IEEE SIEPON standard.  The promotion of the Chinese standard to the international level is an important feature of SIEPON.  The SIEPON standard is developed according to the principle of compatibility at the system level in order to ensure that EPON-level transmission, functionality, compatibility in management, including system tuning, quality of operation, survivability and maintenance management, are used at the use of equipment from different manufacturers.

    <h6>  Edition of the standard CCSA 10G-EPON </h6><br>  In China, the standardization of 10G-EPON is already nearing completion, the document entitled ‚ÄúAccess Network Technology requires a passive optical Ethernet network at 10 Gbit / s (10G-EPON)‚Äù was officially published in early 2011 under number YD / T 2274-2011 .  CCSA Standard ‚ÄúOptical Transceiver Modules and xPON Specifications Part 4: Optical Transceivers Used in Optical Line Terminals and Optical Network Units (OLT and ONU) of 10G-EPON Technology‚Äù added the necessary budget level PR / PRX40 / 50, meeting the requirements of using splitters and long distances.  This standard was published in early 2011 under the number YD / T 1688.4-2011. <br><br><h6>  BBF TR-200 Standard Edition </h6><br>  The TR-200 is an EPON standard based on the TR-101 architecture, its main content is the EPON and 10G-EPON systems architecture, as well as the requirements for high-level functions.  This standard was completed and published in March 2010. <br><br><h5>  Analysis of industry readiness </h5><br><h6>  MAC chips for 10G-EPON </h6><br>  The number of top chip makers for 10G-EPON is increasing, showing rapid development and new features: <br>  1. Investments from the manufacturers of components and chips (including Qualcomm, Broadcom (TC), PMC, Cortina, Marvell) are being made with all our might.  In 2010, ASIC suppliers already implemented two OLT families and two ONU families, which became an important indicator of meeting the needs of a commercial scale.  Within 2011, the number of solutions on chipsets for OLT and ONU should reach four. <br>  2. Chips for 10G-EPON show high compatibility, high performance, original high-tech features, second-generation 10G-EPON chips are already superior to third and fourth generation E / GPON chips, significantly reducing cost and power consumption.  See below for details. <br><br><h6>  Optical modules 10G-EPON </h6><br>  In the first half of 2010, optical modules for 10G-EPON ONU became available in bulk volumes: Hisense (Êµ∑‰ø°), Source Photonics (Á¥¢Â∞îÊñØ), NeoPhotonics (Êñ∞ È£û ÈÄö), Superxon (‰ºò Âçö Âàõ), WTD (Ê≠¶Ê±â Áîµ‰ø° Âô®‰ª∂) ) and other manufacturers have proposed optical modules PRX30 and PR30 for 10G-EPON ONU. <br>  In the second half of 2010, XFP optical modules for 10G-EPON OLT became available: Hisense, Source Photonics, NeoPhotonics, Superxon offered the PRX30 and PR30 optical modules for 10G-EPON OLT. <br>  In 2011, samples of the optical modules PRX40 and PR40 for ONU from Hisense and InnoLight (Êó≠ Âàõ) became available.  In the fourth quarter of 2011, samples of the optical modules PRX40 and PR40 for the OLT should appear. <br><br><h6>  Compatibility of chips and equipment from different manufacturers </h6><br>  In July 2009, China Telecom organized a meeting of manufacturers Broadcom, Qualcomm, PMC and HiSilicon (Êµ∑ÊÅ©), tested the compatibility of symmetric 10G-EPON chips, and carried out the world's first unbalanced 10G-EPON interaction at the chipset level. <br>  In November 2011, Broadcom, Qualcomm, PMC, Cortina and HiSilicon tested the compatibility of symmetric 10G-EPON chips and basically solved the compatibility problems of 10G-EPON chips. <br>  In April 2011, Broadcom, Qualcomm and PMC tested the chipset scrambling algorithm, increasing the security of 10G-EPON networks and removing the obstacle to readiness of chipsets. <br>  In April 2011, China Telecom organized a meeting of ZTE, Huawei, Fiberhome and New Postcom companies and tested the capabilities, efficiency and compatibility of 10G-EPON equipment.  The test results showed step-by-step control of the production chain, rapid development and full implementation of the compatibility of chipsets and equipment.  This laid a solid foundation for commercial use and the rapid cost reduction of 10G-EPON equipment. <br><br><h5>  Product availability of various equipment manufacturers, the situation with commercial use, interconnections and compatibility between various manufacturers. </h5><br>  Currently, leading manufacturers (ZTE, Huawei and Fiberhome) have already presented 10G-EPON products, covering various application possibilities, advanced manufacturers (ZTE and Fiberhome) have already implemented ASIC technology for 10G-EPON products and have started mass production. <br>  Major equipment manufacturers were able to succeed by conducting, organized by providers, tests of uniform systems and compatibility, comparison with the existing EPON requirements for testing equipment availability, including symmetric and asymmetrical modes, system functionality, networking capabilities, business indicators, Multicast, protection and security, OAM and remote administration, fully reflecting the existing compliance of 10G-EPON products with real business requirements for functionality, degree ready  spine and compatibility.  The test results showed that the 10G-EPON equipment is ready (matured), and compatibility at the equipment level has been achieved. <br>  The 10G-EPON equipment is already being used on the scale of networking, for use in HSI, IPTV, VoIP, WiFi, TDM, as well as other applications.  It is possible to build mixed EPON / 10G-EPON networks, allowing for smooth network updates to the 10G-EPON standard.  Already available channels with a speed of 1 Gbit / s and 10 Gbit / s.  In China, at present, the coverage of subscribers on the basis of 10G-EPON has reached 320 thousand users. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  At the moment, the 10G-EPON production chain is ready, the standard is already complete and stable.  MAC chips, optical modules and other key components already meet the requirements for large-scale commercial production;  leading equipment manufacturers can offer a complete line of FTTx equipment based on ASIC, the 10G-EPON production chain has already reached the level of the 2008 EPON standard and can fully meet the requirements of a commercial scale. <br><br>  Author: Fu Zhiming, Ma Zhuang, Bei Jinsong. <br>  Source: Chinese Network Portal C114 ( <a href="http://www.c114.net/topic/3037/a642294.html">http://www.c114.net/topic/3037/a642294.html</a> ) <br>  Translation from Chinese. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134682/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134682/</a></p>
