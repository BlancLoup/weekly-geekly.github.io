  <section class="page js-page"><h1>C ++ User Group in Russian</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello! <br>  Not long ago, I <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/203310/">wrote</a> about my trip to a Meeting C ++ conference in D√ºsseldorf.  In the process of discussing the trip with different people, including at Habr√©, I realized that not only did I lack live communication with my colleagues.  There are many meetings, conferences and seminars devoted to software development and its various aspects.  But, in the light of the emergence of the new standard, a lot has changed and I want to discuss it not only on the Internet, but also personally.  That is, I want to talk specifically about C ++ and related issues: a new standard, trends, boost, various useful ways, solutions, and so on.  So behind the discussions, I somehow unnoticed and suddenly decided for myself to organize a C ++ User Group in Russia. <br><br>  Under the cut briefly what came of it so far. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  General idea </h5><br>  Almost immediately, the concept of a group took shape, not as a community of people in one city, but as a professional community uniting programmers in different cities.  This means that for each meeting it would be good to bring speakers from other cities.  And if you manage to bring the audience, it is generally cool.  Why so?  First of all, it's fun.  Secondly, it is the expansion of professional ties.  Thirdly, this is a good reason to visit the major cities of the immense Motherland.  While such criteria for selecting a city for a meeting have taken shape: <br><ul><li>  Population over 1 million </li><li>  The presence of at least one person from this city who writes articles or notes about C ++.  It is desirable that this person went on contact. </li><li>  The presence of IT companies in this city that are developing in C ++ </li></ul><br><br><h5>  First meeting.  St. Petersburg </h5><br>  The city of three revolutions sheltered us first.  I found a quite accessible conference room, created an event on Habr√© and G + and started looking for speakers.  The meeting was scheduled for December 14 - some already celebrated the New Year, others did not want to report on an incomprehensible get-together, some did not respond at all.  One way or another, the first reports were mine and <a href="http://anto-nonco.blogspot.ru/">Anton Nonko</a> .  Anton and I were speakers from another city.  It so happened that we did not really have time to prepare reports and these were speeches in the spirit of: ‚ÄúHello, my name is Seryozha, I am writing in C ++.‚Äù  But at this meeting was <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/khizmax/" class="user_link">khizmax</a> , who made a very cool <a href="http://www.meetingcpp.ru/cpp/cpp-spb-2013/Lock-free%2520data%2520structures.pdf">report</a> on lock-free data structures.  Thanks again, Maxim! <br>  Suddenly, more than twenty people came to the meeting, and after the event, many approached and asked why no one knew about the meeting, why there had never been such meetings and when the next one would be.  I appreciated this first meeting for myself as successful and decided to continue. <br>  Conclusions that I made for myself after this meeting. <br><ul><li>  <s>Prepare good, interesting reports.</s> </li><li>  Try to attract more participants. </li><li>  Record video or screencast </li><li>  Actively seek speakers. </li></ul><br><h5>  The second meeting.  Moscow </h5><br>  The meeting took place yesterday, February 15. <br>  Since I immediately planned to bring speakers from other cities, I was looking for a room closer to the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe three stations.  As a result, I found a decent enough room for 60 people in a 30-minute leisurely walk from it.  To attract people, I again created an event on Habr√© and G +, but this time I wrote off with Jens Weller and asked him to mention us in his C ++ User Group reviews, which he writes for <a href="http://meetingcpp.com/">Meeting C ++</a> and cross-post on <a href="http://isocpp.org/">isocpp.org</a> Find The speakers at this time was not difficult.  Here is a list of reports that were heard at this meeting. <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Grigory Demchenko aka <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/gridem/" class="user_link">gridem</a> , Asynchrony and competitiveness on coroutines. </td><td>  <a href="http://www.meetingcpp.ru/cpp/cpp-moscow-2014/1%2520%25D0%2590%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2585%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C%2520%25D0%25B8%2520%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C%2520%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%2520%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2585.pdf">Slides</a> , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DuUQX5QS1CCg">screencast</a> . </td></tr><tr><td>  Andrey Ivanitsky, C ++ Memory model. </td><td>  <a href="http://www.meetingcpp.ru/cpp/cpp-moscow-2014/2%2520Memory-Model.pdf">Slides</a> , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D1aYBRWFV7g4">screencast</a> . </td></tr><tr><td>  Anthony Polukhin aka <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/antoshkka/" class="user_link">antoshkka</a> , Boost and C ++ 11 / C ++ 14: News from the front, or a bit of everything. </td><td>  <a href="http://www.meetingcpp.ru/cpp/cpp-moscow-2014/3%2520C%2B%2BandBoost4.pdf">Slides</a> , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DbkNC8JA35ks">screencast</a> . </td></tr><tr><td>  Dmitriy Hecteruk aka <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/mezastel/" class="user_link">mezastel</a> , High Performance Computing in C / C ++. </td><td>  <a href="http://www.meetingcpp.ru/cpp/cpp-moscow-2014/4%2520%25D0%2592%25D1%258B%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5%2520%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D1%2587%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%2520%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%2520%25D0%25A1%2B%2B.pdf">Slides</a> , screencast Dmitry promised to do it himself and post it later. </td></tr><tr><td>  Alexander Putilin, C ++ and mapreduce. </td><td>  <a href="http://www.meetingcpp.ru/cpp/cpp-moscow-2014/5%2520mapreduce_cpp_ug_presentation_cut.pdf">Slides</a> , <a href="http://youtu.be/Etn-NzkQ8RA">screencast</a> . </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  I generally enjoyed the meeting.  All reports were interesting, thanks again guys!  The hall for 60+ people (at my request, chairs were delivered there) was almost full.  I hope those who attended too.  For myself, noted the following. <br><ul><li>  I decided that the best way to do each report is no more than 50 minutes, taking into account the discussions, after each report there is a 10-minute break.  I will try to strictly follow this in the future. </li><li>  The sound quality is poor.  I will look for a good microphone. </li></ul>

    <h5>  Third meeting.  Nizhny Novgorod </h5><br>  This meeting is scheduled for April 19, I will try to arrange it in Nizhny Novgorod.  While I do not know anything about her, but I suggest you to help me.  If you want to make a report, write to me discuss it.  If you live in Nizhny Novgorod, can you or your employer help you find a hall or attract participants? <br><br><h5>  Future plans </h5><br><ul><li>  Learn to record sound with decent quality. </li><li>  After the first meeting, kind people gave me the domain meetingcpp.ru, I hope some content will appear there soon. </li><li>  I hope to tie the donat to the site, as it‚Äôs not always possible to find sponsors, let alone pay for it. </li><li>  Make a pre-registration, so that at least approximately know how many people will come. </li><li>  After several local meetings, hold a large C ++ conference in Russia.  Ideally international. </li></ul><br>  I will not refuse help in organizing any of these items. <br>  Thank! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/212793/">https://habr.com/ru/post/212793/</a></p>
