Yes, it is not so much, but you can choose and buy something good without any problems.  In order to alleviate the problem of choice, today we are publishing a small selection of things that we consider to be an excellent gift not only for February 14th. <br><br>  In general, it is not necessary to be attached precisely to this date (although, of course, it‚Äôs worth a try).  Gifts are always nice to receive, so the same selection can be used as a mini-guide at any other time.  Not sure what to give a person for a birthday or anniversary?  Madrobots goes to the rescue. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Smart pot for plants Parrot Pot </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/401/61f/032/40161f032b3e8c2702d7921e85ec4d9d.jpg" width="850">

      Many home plants require serious care.  They need to be watered at a certain time, and the water must be of a certain temperature (for some species).  The most important criterion of plant well-being is the acidity of the soil, as well as the brightness of solar or artificial light.  Plus, there are many other factors that novice gardeners hardly know. <br><br>  It is quite realistic to follow this independently, but this task may not be for everyone.  And if the owner of a demanding plant also regularly goes on business trips, the task of leaving becomes almost impossible.  Nothing is impossible - the smart Parrot Pot flower pot will take most of the routine tasks of caring for the plant. <br><br>  The pot has sensors of acidity, temperature, light and water jets, through which it removes life-giving moisture (up to 2.2 liters of water).  Plus there is a wireless communication module that provides data transfer to the phone.  A special application contains information about 8,000 different indoor plants.  The program can not only determine the optimal conditions for the plant, but also give advice to the owner on how much fertilizer is needed and whether this particular flower loves sunlight. <br><br>  In general, this is a great gift option for a geek - a <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/parrot-pot/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3D14_poborka">smart pot for the Parrot Pot plants is</a> useful both at home and in the office. <br><br><h3>  Fitness tracker Xiaomi Mi Band 2 </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d25/4cc/8fb/d254cc8fb9dfaa1e538a9c84e7b145c7.jpg" width="850"><br><br>  Xiaomi company is famous for budget and affordable smart devices.  These are scales, phones, trackers and much more.  Relatively recently, this company launched the second version of the Xiaomi Mi Band fitness bracelet.  The bracelet shows the owner detailed information about his daily physical activity.  This includes determining the distance traveled with counting the number of steps, and calories burned, plus monitoring sleep quality.  Xiaomi Mi Band 2 is equipped with a heart rate monitor, which allows you to monitor the work of the heart during exercise and at rest. <br><br>  Xiaomi Mi Band 2 notifies you of incoming calls and SMS.  With the help of the bracelet, you can automatically unlock your smartphone, which is quite convenient.  This model has a monochrome display, which shows the various characteristics of the activity of the owner of the bracelet.  If desired, the information can be viewed at any time. <br><br>  You <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/xiaomi-mi-band-2/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3D14_poborka">can</a> buy a smart bracelet <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/xiaomi-mi-band-2/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3D14_poborka">in Madrobots</a> . <br><br><h3>  Atlas Genetic Test </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/15a/7d8/f96/15a7d8f960817b19e47cab4f3c034e7a.jpg" width="850"><br><br>  The creators of the Atlas genetic test can examine its genome for a small amount of a human biomaterial.  Why do you need it?  For example, the test will tell you if a person has a predisposition to any serious diseases or to determine which sport is best suited for you.  Atlas helps to understand how you can get sick in the future and how to avoid it.  The test also makes it possible to determine which foods are not recommended to a specific person, so that according to the results of the test, it will be possible to form an optimal diet and lifestyle in general.  Test results are divided into categories such as health, nutrition, sport, the origin of a person, personal qualities. <br><br>  The buyer of the test gets a tube for collecting biomaterial (saliva).  After the sample is placed in the test tube, it remains to call the courier and send the test to the Atlas Medical Center.  Here, experts will analyze on high-quality equipment, and the results of the analysis will be uploaded to the user's personal account on the company's website.  In addition, the cost of the test includes a free online consultation with a specialist in genetics, who will answer all questions that arise after reviewing the results of a genetic test. <br><br>  This is a great gift for friends, relatives, colleagues.
