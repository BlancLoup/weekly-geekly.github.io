  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Online Trends 2017</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day!  You have probably heard about the annual Internet Trends analytical reviews from the well-known KPCB foundation.  Each of them is a storehouse of useful information with a lot of interesting figures and forecasts.  In the last 355 slides.  I recommend to get acquainted with all, but for the format of the article on Geektimes I will present my interpretation of the main theses from <a href="http://dq756f9pzlyr3.cloudfront.net/file/Internet%2BTrends%2B2017%2BReport.pdf">this document</a> . <br><br><h2>  Internet advertising </h2><br>  Despite the fact that the global supply of smartphones is declining, there are more than 2.8 billion in total. Most importantly, the growth of the US online advertising market in 2016 was only due to mobile platforms, while the share of desktop advertising has declined. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/917/e8e/ccc/917e8ecccd56458391a9850912cc1438.png"><br>  By the way, 85% of the annual growth of online advertising in the United States are Facebook and Google.  Only two companies have such a huge impact on a separate area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe largest economy in the world.  The conclusion of this topic will be that according to the fund's forecasts in 2017, global spending on advertising on the network will exceed the cost of advertising on TV. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Games </h2><br>  In the Internet Trends 2017 paid great attention to the gaming industry.  The largest gaming market in the world - the Asia-Pacific region.  It accounts for 47% of the total world gaming revenue.  In second place is North America (25%), in third place is Western Europe (17%).  The total volume of the gaming market in 2016, according to Newzoo, amounted to $ 100 billion.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f8d/9f2/e14/f8d9f2e14fb9400b8b0a675887145e34.png"><br><br>  Today there are about 2.6 billion gamers in the world, and in 1995 there were only 100 million. The average age of a player is 35 years.  According to the previous schedule, the number of gamers over 50 is not much less than underage gamers.  The number of e-sports viewers is also growing, with a monthly audience of 161 million. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e82/433/b82/e82433b82ea34706be30f6db1c54e303.png"><br><br>  Surprisingly, things familiar to us all, such as software updates, interactive learning, social proof, appeared in the games of the 70s.  The games themselves have become the most complex technological product inside, adapting both to the user and the viewer.  In games, a new potential of commerce, entertainment, commerce, and advertising opens up. <br><br><h2>  IT infrastructure and security </h2><br>  The share of public and private clouds in the category of costs for IT infrastructure is growing and amounted to 37%.  The share of traditional data centers is declining.  Among public cloud services, Amazon Web Services remains the market leader. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b50/433/ffa/b50433ffa91a4cecbd578158d390c7e9.png"><br><br>  In this case, the more applications goes into the "cloud", the more difficult it is to ensure their reliability and security.  As a result, the number of spam and phishing grows.  Since the beginning of 2015, the number of spam emails on users' emails has increased by 350% and most of them are dangerous emails containing viruses.  And more than half of the Internet traffic in 2016 was <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/321222/">generated by bots</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/566/85e/a00/56685ea00c9f439895f9b63cab211ac8.png"><br><br><h2>  China </h2><br>  China demonstrates enormous values ‚Äã‚Äãin almost all segments of the Internet and these values ‚Äã‚Äãcontinue to grow.  According to the KPCB report, technology companies generate the main revenue in the Chinese market.  In second place is the health sector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/8fd/162/5a1/8fd1625a18334f60a0962ce662d8217a.png"><br><br>  In China, about 700 million mobile Internet users.  Most of the time on the Internet, the inhabitants of the heavenly people <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/284834/">spend communicating in WeChat</a> and QQ.  The gross merchandise volume (sales in terms of money) for mobile platforms in China is much higher than that for desktop devices.  The volume of mobile payments is growing exponentially and in 2016 amounted to $ 5 trillion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/4d8/145/2dd/4d81452dd5ca4ca198787adf7e6597f1.png"><br><br>  In addition, China is the largest market for services ordered by trips and bicycle rentals, where people make more than 10 billion trips per year, and 20 million leases bicycles every month. <br><br><h2>  India </h2><br>  The Internet Trends 2017 for India provides significantly more data than for China.  In India, there are only 355 million Internet users (80% from mobile devices), which is 40% more than a year earlier.  The Internet penetration rate in the country is only 27%.  Almost 75% of networked people are under 35 years old.  And in India, dozens of languages ‚Äã‚Äãand more than half of users are consumers of content in the local language. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/945/39b/65d/94539b65d680498cb7a3261f496de74f.png"><br><br>  In India, there is a state system of identification of citizens, which consists of two key elements: Aadhaar (12-digit number based on biometric and demographic data) and eKYC (secure storage of digital copies of documents).  In this system, nearly 1.2 billion people are registered.  Over 15 million authentications are performed daily via Aadhaar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b3c/864/2e7/b3c8642e7bec4c16a32c04a28cfd35e7.png"><br><br>  It is also noteworthy that the Indians have their own national payment system Unified Payments Interface (UPI).  To make a transfer, it is enough to specify Aadhaar.  The volume of transactions through UPI is growing rapidly and amounts to $ 400 billion monthly.  Moreover, UPI replaced up to 85% of paper money in India. <br><br><h2>  Digital medicine </h2><br>  In 2013, there were 153 exabytes of medical data in the world and their volume grows by ~ 50% every year.  We are also increasing the supply of wearable devices with built-in accelerometers, heart rate monitors, gyros, and so on.  In 2016, 102 million wearable devices were supplied, which is 12% more than in 2015. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d71/a2d/68f/d71a2d68ffcf4d61afa4a8fa6261605d.png"><br><br>  Thank you very much for your attention.
