  <section class="page js-page"><h1>CRM plus mobile communications. We strike integration at low sales</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This time we will not boast much about the achievements in the field of integration of virtual PBX, Internet telephony and mobile communications, since we have been writing about this for more than half a year.  We will try to describe not what has been done (although this too), but what we would like to do in the foreseeable future and what, from our point of view, might be of interest to dear readers.  <a href="http://altegrocloud.ru/">AltegroCloud's</a> virtual PBX honestly performs its tasks and ensures close friendship of mobile phones, people and cloud PBX: records mobile calls, shows statistics of corporate cellular communications in real time and even knows how to find employees on the map using geotags. <br><br>  A lot of effort was spent on integration with a couple of popular CRM systems and they (these same integrations) gave a clear understanding that <a href="http://altegrosim.ru/">our SIM cards</a> + virtual PBX + CRM is a convergent product that allows you to build interesting communication schemes, the complexity of which is limited only by the imagination of developers and possible specific IP.  As a result, a truly curious product was formed, which we, not being a de facto and de jure ‚Äúdog in the hay‚Äù, would like to develop further in close partnership with all the interested parties. <br><br>  <b>In general terms, the AltegroCloud friendship scheme and, for example, CRM looks like this:</b>

Hence, call recording and online call statistics and voice menus and a single company number for all incoming calls, including incoming calls to mobiles.  Convenient, beautiful and innovative. <br><br>  We add CRM to this phone-mobile beauty and we are friends of customer cards, deals and sales analytics with mobile communications.  As a result, we get what is called ‚Äúsomething with something‚Äù - a useful tool for managing sales and collecting statistics on the company's phone life in one place - in the CRM system.  On the example of one, well, very popular, CRM will show how beauty looks through the eyes of a client. <br><br>  <b>There are three magic buttons in the AltegroCloud dashboard: ‚Äúas of now‚Äù</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/09c/fe0/e59/09cfe0e599ff43ce9c0fa9e7ea4dc375.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Pressing each of them for three minutes makes friends with the company's mobile communications and the CRM system, moreover, it makes friends with ease and ease. <br><br>  <b>Like this</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e2/b09/4c5/5e2b094c50fd4e2884c0b3fd58b26ec8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Svetlana, Ekaterina and Olga are on the screen above - girls with mobile phones who work ‚Äúin the fields‚Äù, i.e., their mobiles got into CRM as internal phones, and the good uncle ‚Äúadmin‚Äù is the most important boss, who is concerned that , Catherine and Olga worked as efficiently as possible, and did not chat on cell phones on their personal affairs. <br><br>  <b>We add intrigue to the scheme and precisely configure what we want from the integration of cellular communication and CRM in the PBX settings section</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c47/663/a3b/c47663a3bd364d9fb092e77179612032.png" alt="image"><br><br>  If our girls run into the office only to sign an application for a vacation, and all reports are written at home after work and send them by email (for example, our girls are realtors), then some of the options can be turned off: pop-up cards when you call, call by click by customer number, etc., and leave only the collection of statistics. <br><br>  If the girls work from the office, but the main device for calls is mobile, then we turn everything on at once and see the incoming call to the mobile right in CRM, just like an incoming call to the internal work phone (the person with the rare name Peter Petrov calls us) . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c74/cad/48b/c74cad48bc3e4f1cb89448e075194124.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Svetlana answers calls to her mobile, and the call is displayed in CRM and the call can be seen as a pop-up call card, and when the conversation ends, CRM automatically creates a lead, which is already a key entity in any sales process business process and this lead can be monitored. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ee/4cc/4b3/8ee4cc4b38474290a71f2ed38b8081fc.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And if the kind head of the ‚Äúadmin‚Äù suddenly wants to check how kindly Ekaterina communicated using the mobile manager while nervously smoking in the smoking room with a regular customer Sergey Sergeyevich, then there are no problems - go to the transaction card and listen to the recording. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bbf/bd2/512/bbfbd25128c6483a9493b892e27a2c04.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The transaction card contains the entire history of communication with the client from the office telephone and from the mobile, which does not leave Yekaterina a chance to be rude to Sergey Sergeyevich. <br><br>  If, after a smoking-room, Catherine returns for a working computer and wants to call another client, Oleg Vikentyevich, from a mobile phone, she can do it with a light movement of a well-groomed hand, simply by clicking on the phone number in the card, while the PBX initiates a call from Catherine's mobile phone, and not from her work phone.  Sometimes it is just necessary, because with a mobile phone you can again run into the smoking room and there, in silence, solve all the necessary issues without unnecessary ears and embarrassment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f6/86f/2c0/4f686f2c043b4f02895272286614fa96.png" alt="image"><br><br>  On the screen you can see that AltegroCloud calls first on the mobile phone, and then on the client number.  Catherine is not in the workplace, and we see who, when and how many times she called and we can listen to the recording of the conversation. <br><br>  The story shown above is just an example of a single integration, nothing stunning and different from what we told you about before.  Here something else is important: our SIM cards, our virtual PBX and additional tools that were created during the six months of the service‚Äôs existence can be integrated with almost any other CRM or helpdesk and not just integrated using our ready-made API, but integrated as needed for you, adding a reasonable number of additional options and features, we are ready to do the integration in manual mode. <br><br>  Who might be interested?  Yes, almost everyone: and customers who use their own, self-made (or simply "different"), CRM and developers of the same, "other", or outlandish CRM.  In a word, we will be happy to hear proposals on the integration of our mobile platform with any other platform, ready to be friends with telephony.  Asterisk, friswitch, shugSRM and all other open source and neopensor platforms, we are waiting for you, come to us, ask questions, let's discuss, let's jointly bring into the world the sweet, kind, eternal - new interesting telephone-mobile integrations, let's end digitize and under-digitized integrate undeintegrated.  We are waiting for comments or direct questions and at the same time continue, step by step, to describe how and in what direction our project is developing. <br><cut></cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/265041/">https://habr.com/ru/post/265041/</a></p>
