  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Neurology in video games: Deus Ex: Human Revolution</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> There is an inquisitive thing that occupies the space between our ears.  This space with a few pounds of gray matter provides an incredible degree of plasticity, takes into account the full range of personalities, emotions and thoughts, but all this in a limited physical space.  When studying neurology, it is difficult to ignore the beauty and effectiveness of the human brain.  But what are the limits of a biological substrate, like a brain, and how can we expand our capabilities with it? <br><br>  The desperate search for the improvement of our natural biology, ironically, is the inevitable result of the same own biology.  In addition, the idea that billions of years of evolution lie in the mechanism can cause confusion for those of us who are used to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãconstant technological improvement and development, for example, how our current model of the universe evolved to cope with the foundations of the Ancient World.  There is an actual question: ‚ÄúWhere (and what is it) the Human Brain 2.0?‚Äù This question is revealed in some potentially prophetic fantasy games, such as Deus Ex: Human Revolution, in which neurology meets with synthetic improvements in a fascinating and terrifying form. <br><br><img src="http://www.thwacke.com/images/analysis/DXHR1.jpg" alt="image">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Implant Revolution</b> <br><br>  HR focuses on the effects of artificial improvement. Those who can afford it enjoy improved speed, strength, cognitive and sensory functions.  Quite principled or simply poor people who cannot afford implants are seriously disadvantaged, and as a natural consequence of this discrepancy, the struggle between them and the ‚Äúprivileged‚Äù transhumanists and corporations that have improved them begins.  For the story is crucial the path that you choose, it will greatly affect the ending.  But to what extent are HR features based on reality, and not just science fiction? <br><br>  <b>Negative Implants: The Story of Neuroposine</b> <br><br>  In the world of HR, the fictional drug neuroposine, a medicinal ointment necessary for people with implants so that their weak human bodies do not reject mechanical parts.  Without neuroposine around the implant, ‚Äúglial tissue buildup‚Äù develops, which promotes regeneration, and ultimately leads to its abandonment (Darrow syndrome in the Deus Ex universe).  This leads a person with implants to drug dependence, which gives a huge control to the powerful pharmaceutical company VersaLife, as well as general social chaos, since the broad masses of the population refuse to depend on neurospin only to maintain control over their own body. <br><br>  Eidos Montreal deserves praise for integrating some of the real aspects of neuroscience in its narratives.  So let's see what they did right.  Your nervous system can be divided into what we call the "Central" (brain and spinal cord) and the "peripheral" (the rest of the body) nervous system.  Glial cells are often perceived as assistants of the peripheral and central nervous systems, because they support the functions of neurons and nerve cells.  In the central nervous system, "glial tissues" do exist, in a sense;  A process known as "glial scars" occurs after neurological injury.  After damage, types of glial cells, known as astrocytes, respond to a change in shape and occupy the area around the injury site, releasing molecules that inhibit regrowth and lead to the formation of glial scars.  The presence of these astrocytes, as well as the molecules they release, prevent the spread of axons from damage sites and the re-formation of functional parts.  This is one of the main obstacles in the rehabilitation of spinal cord injuries;  axons (processes of neurons that provide communication with other cells) from neurons below the injury site, which first try to spread and re-connect with neurons on the other side, but will be blocked by a scar.  We already have several pharmacological agents for suppressing and treating glial scars: olomucine, which reduces the number of astrocytes and can promote axon regeneration, ribavirin, which reduces the number of active astrocytes and rolipram, which leads to axon growth. <br><br><img src="http://www.thwacke.com/images/analysis/DXHR2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Astrocytes: helpers or scarring little bastards?</i> <br><br>  However, you can see one problem with the interpretation of biology in Deus Ex.  If glial scars occur after neurological injuries, to stop the growth of growth, then why do people restore motility and sensations after nerve damage in the limbs, fingers, and so on?  This is because in the peripheral nervous system, glial tissues are slightly different, namely the types of glial cells that help after injury and allow axons to re-grow and construct functional connections.  So, about the brain and spinal cord: there are no astrocytes, there is no ‚Äúglial tissue buildup‚Äù, neuroposin is not needed, no problems.  This means that peripheral improvements (see figure below) will be in order and without the drug. <br><br><img src="http://www.thwacke.com/images/analysis/DXHR3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Peripheral enhancements are circled in red.</i> <br><br>  As for improvements that are directly attached to the central nervous system, glial scars either should not be a problem for them, or they will not be a problem as long as they are integrated into existing neural networks.  All breaks in the neural circuits can be overcome by implants. <br><br><img src="http://www.thwacke.com/images/analysis/DXHR4.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Improvements in the central nervous system are outlined in dark blue, light blue color enhancements that cannot directly connect to the brain or spinal cord, but depend on other improvements.</i> <br><br>  As for the rejection of these devices by the immune system, our immune system is aimed at maintaining the well-being of organic, biological parts that are not present in synthetic implants.  The only remaining goals of immunology are ‚Äúliving nerve cells‚Äù in the HR version of PEDOT electrodes, but these cells and their compounds can be protected from the immune system with the help of a trapping system that is already used by scientists today.  By the way, PEDOT electrodes, less live nerve cells in them, currently exist, and their composition can make them useful for implantation in humans.  Finally, all the problems of the immune system can be avoided altogether with the help of embryonic stem cells, or even to extract stem cells from oneself, in order to create neurons of the PEDOT electrode in HR.  Thus, you do not have to be Adam Jensen to do without neuropozin. <br><br><img src="http://www.thwacke.com/images/analysis/DXHR5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Science in games is constantly reaching new heights, it is necessary and appreciated, ideally accurate game is limited in its freedom to create a new and exciting fictional world.  With scientific accuracy, it is necessary to find a balance between realism and fantasy in order to create an ideal, but this is not always an achievable goal, especially if history has such a high priority.  To justify the presence of neurosofin in HR, designer Maria DeMarle said: ‚ÄúThe concept of neurosofin in the game helps us sharpen social divisions in the game ... but it was also important for a number of other reasons related to history.  First, it gave us the opportunity to visually illustrate the uniqueness of Adam.  Secondly, this is due to a side quest in the game.  And, thirdly, it allowed us to make some interesting interweaving with DX1 and a certain pharmaceutical company operated by members of the Illuminati ... ".  Scriptwriters took care of scientific accuracy, they consulted with Will Rossellini, founder of MicroTransponder Inc.  and a graduate student in neurology, who spoke about his role: ‚ÄúWhen I volunteered to be a scientific consultant in 2008, I said:‚Äù Let's imagine where today's research can lead us in 20 years ... there is a lot of what science is connected with the plot and this is explained in the game ".  Maria DeMarle reaffirmed the importance of Rossellini‚Äôs scientific contribution: ‚ÄúPerhaps this will eventually open our eyes to something we haven‚Äôt even dreamed of.‚Äù <br><br>  Although I like the way that Eidos Montreal has chosen to actually integrate neuroscience in its history, I completely agree that in order to create the type of fictional world that you can imagine, you must sometimes make compromises in order to maintain a convincing narrative.  In general, I hope that we will support this trend of science in games, since the combination of realism and fiction reinforces the sense of immersion in both the present and the fictional worlds in which we find ourselves. <br><br>  <a href="http://gamasutra.com/blogs/SebastianAlvarado/20120524/171024/Neuroscience_in_video_games_Deus_Ex_Human_Revolution.php">a source</a> <br>  <i>Suggestions for improving the translation leave in the comments, thank you.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144643/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144643/</a></p>
