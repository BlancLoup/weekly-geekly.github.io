The key difference between such a project and any other IT project is the need to manage the community.  And I went to study at the Yammer Certified Community Manager, that is, the community manager.

      Or rather, did not go, but sat down to study.  The training was conducted online, divided into six modules, one module per week.  Each module has a theoretical part in the form of presentations and practical exercises.  Estimated temporary load on one module - 3 hours. <br><br>  Well, okay, I go to the first module, start reading the presentation and after a dozen slides I come across a sign <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="240" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/e65/5c8/f65/e655c8f65aeadc54e8c185aa9cc912a1.png" title="Sign" alt=""></div><br><br>  It turns out this is homework.  Until you complete it, you cannot return to the presentation.  As part of the first assignment, I need to go to the <a href="https://www.yammer.com/itpronetwork">external network of Yammer fans</a> , join the closed group for the current training flow, meet other students, find a greeting for the coach and answer some of his questions on a specific hashtag.  I do, go back to the presentation, read ten more slides and again this wonderful sign appears.  Now it is necessary to enter into the general document of our group and describe the strengths of the corporate social network of their company.  I enter the document, I see that several of my colleagues have already completed the task.  And it turns out that everyone has a very different situation.  And another student edits the document at the same time with me.  Cool feature for group work under time constraints!  We exchange greetings with him, at the end I leave the document, finish reading the presentation, perform another task, pass the test.  Hurray-hurray, the first module is complete! <br><br>  After a week, I set aside time for Module 2. This module is about opinion leaders (they are also champions, they are also leaders, as you prefer).  Already waiting for the appearance of Yammer Time.  And it comes, only now I have to go not to the external network of Yammer, but to the network of my company.  Create an open group there to discuss the role of opinion leaders for our organization, and even organize a discussion.  I begin to understand that there will be no freebies, in practice I have to be the leader of opinions in my own company.  I return to the presentation of the module and see the answers to the task I have just completed.  On the one hand, I would have looked a little forward ‚Äî I would not have spent several hours on the task.  But I got the knowledge I really believe in, because I got to it myself. <br><br>  This is still fine.  The last task of the module is to involve the big boss!  Because <a href="http://supereon.ru/blog/V-samom-rastcvete-sil/">without bosses, the networks do not soar</a> .  Okay, I'm not afraid of bosses, and someone else may be afraid.  And it is necessary to go, as they say, part of the job.  I think that at this moment some regretted that they decided to study here.  Joke))).  In fact, the question is really complicated, I see how other students begin to ask for advice from the group.  I connect <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ssuser73a73f/yammer-44638977">with my five kopecks</a> .  With the help of our advice one guy for the first time in his life was able to get through to the big boss.  Cool and nice!  All together we cheer him on. <br><br>  Module 3. I read into the maturity model of the corporate social network and rank my own network as a task.  It turns out not so much that the rudimentary level, but very low, I begin to understand what it is worth striving for.  But the cunning author of the training does not stop there.  On his instructions, I find weak spots in our corporate culture and think of how to overcome them with the help of the corporate social network.  At the same time I watch the tasks of other students.  Hee-hee, they also have nehily problems in corporate culture, which means that everything is not so bad. <br><br>  I understand how working with corporate culture is more multidimensional than implementing Active Directory or building a network on Cisco! <br><br>  Module 4. And now the equator, this time we understand the moderation of the network.  And the tasks are becoming more difficult.  Imagine that someone in your network did not write a very good comment like ‚ÄúAgain, our sales base is not working, I‚Äôm going to drink coffee!‚Äù Or ‚ÄúWow, Friday, who is with us in the bar?‚Äù.  I, as the future manager of the community, need to calmly, respectfully and without a mat to answer a person so that he and all others understand <a href="https://ru.wikisource.org/wiki/%25D0%25A7%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE_%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2588%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25B8_%25D1%2587%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE_%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE_(%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9)">what is good and what is bad</a> .  Do you think this is easy ???  And the students helped again.  I discovered that I was already two hundred and fifty people answering these questions.  I look at the answers, again I wonder how much the corporate cultures are different, I compile my answer.  Crowdsourcing is a great power! <br><br>  In the same module comes an interesting task.  In the Yammer external network, we are invited to participate as organizers of an online chat session called <a href="https://www.yammer.com/itpronetwork/">YamJam</a> .  Eh, it would be great, but I don‚Äôt want to get up at two in the morning in Moscow.  For such as I have come up with another test.  Schedule a ten-day program to promote your network with detailed tasks for each day.  What I am doing. <br><br>  Module 5. This time we need to write down the scenarios for using Yammer in our company, create a welcome letter on behalf of the boss, paint a communication plan and events to involve people in our network.  But I have already experienced, I go first to peep earlier work of graduates of this course.  I read, enrich their experience, write, rewrite, rewrite again, in general, for several approaches I master the tasks. <br><br><br>  And here is Module 6. We deal with analytics.  Initially, the tasks are simple, then it comes to PowerPivot.  I am glad that I almost completed my studies and here comes the fourth assignment, so to speak, thesis.  We need to make a workbook for managing the internal corporate community in our company.  I quietly press in a chair while reading all that needs to be done.  And here I understand that almost all the work I have already done, performing tasks from the previous modules.  Oh, happiness (for those who did their homework)!  I collect my thesis, add a little trolling to it ... <br><br><img width="640" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/b11/4d7/75a/b114d775a7d12a886bb10d55a6504581.jpg" height="287" title="training" alt=""><br><br>  ... and in a couple of weeks I get my diploma!  Congratulations on completing the YCCM! <br><br>  *** <br><br>  Why did this training surprise me? <br><br>  <b>The first.</b>  Understanding that in order to serve the network, you need to work as a network.  If you have not previously participated in mass communications, then just take it and make money in another way will not work.  The training for a few weeks consolidated the practice of networking and network management.  If you take an analogy from programming, it's like Microsoft Visual C ++ 1.0, written on itself. <br><br>  <b>The second.</b>  Maximum useful exhaust compared to all the other trainings that I took.  Almost everything I did during the training really came in handy in my life. <br><br>  Now, as part of the implementation of productive communities, we are already conducting <a href="http://supereon.ru/services/%3Fe%3D1395">trainings on community management</a> .  This is an improved version of the above training, taking into account Russian experience.  It is useful to those who are going to introduce internal portals or corporate social networks.  To feel from the inside the essence of what you are actually going to implement. <br><br>  <b>Vladimir Ivanitsa</b> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ivanitsa"><u>Facebook</u></a> |  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivanitsa"><u>LinkedIn</u></a> <br><br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298182/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298182/</a></p>
