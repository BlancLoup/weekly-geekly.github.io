Without exception.  Someone leaks a couple of thousand a month, someone has a hole like in the Titanic.  Different scales, problems are the same.  In relation to the giants of the market, it is believed that their marketing is perfect, and advertising campaigns give a golden glow.  In fact, they make gross mistakes. <br><br>  In this case, we show one simple idea, which made it possible to increase the number of leads by almost 2 times in the Beeline company.  Given that the advertising budget was reduced by 33 times.  Mechanics work in corporations and in micro-businesses.  What's the matter?  Open and see for yourself. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      To begin with the problem of the market as a whole.  Many marketers are still stuck in the 90s.  Large advertising agencies are no exception.  The guys take 1-2 million rubles for "strategic consulting", make an analysis of market segments with the conclusion that your audience is mostly women of 25-35 years old with average incomes.  And this is in the era of Big Data, yeah. <br><br>  Then the whole team creates "zaboristye" creatives.  The same for television, street promotion.  For landing pages, which is the worst.  In order to get into the heart of a large audience and sell them a product.  It is just the same as zhahnut from the Tsar Cannon by a pack of sparrows. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a2f/123/9b0/a2f1239b0ac54c72b4d1eba82c391043.jpg"><br><br>  The main thing is to capture market share and drain the budget yard.  That's what will happen with this approach in Internet marketing. <br><br>  And now about Beeline itself.  We took on systematization (a kind of consulting) two directions - ‚ÄúBusiness Internet‚Äù and ‚ÄúCloud PBX‚Äù.  Speech in the case will go about the first direction.  At the same time, we are not contractors in context, but a kind of superstructure above it. <br><br><h2>  Initial data </h2><br><br>  ‚ÄúBusiness Internet‚Äù is a wireless 4G Internet bundled with a router for legal entities.  Beeline puts it for 1 ruble, equipment included ‚Äúfor free‚Äù. <br><br>  Product properties - Wi-Fi router.  Mounted anywhere;  weight is lighter than a smartphone;  Provides stable 4G Internet up to 100 MGB and up to 32 users at the same time. <br><br>  The main competitors are Yota, Rostelecom, MGTS. <br><br>  Target audience (main groups) - small retail and services.  Any point with a separate entrance (hairdressers, beauty salons, cafeterias, canteens, small shops) and in places where wired Internet is not available (suburb, basement floors, attics and other places of interest).  Also - home-business, startups, novice digital-agencies. <br><br>  Advertising campaign in Yandex Direct (on search). <br><br>  The offer on the main page looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/11b/8eb/b6b/11b8ebb6bfd64b94a71f7f12589beb82.jpg"><br><br>  That very approach is one value proposition for all.  Please note: it does not cover even a small fraction of the needs of all segments.  Given that absolutely all traffic from contextual advertising goes here. <br><br><h2>  Task </h2><br><br>  Reduce the cost of maintaining the Republic of Kazakhstan, increase the number of applications. <br><br><h2>  What did </h2><br><br>  1) Disconnected non-targeted traffic for those groups to whom the product of Business Internet is "past the box office".  This brought down the total amount of traffic from Direct in 35 (!) Times.  Calm, only calm!  The most interesting thing to come. <br><br>  2) Since we work in conjunction with the context, we focused as much as possible on the search parameters.  These are hyper (narrow) traffic segments: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f2/cc7/435/7f2cc7435fd0485b974b861e12a7aff8.jpg"><br><br>  And each segment shows our offer or unique selling proposition.  On one landing page, with the help of <b><a href="http://yagla.ru/">Yagla</a></b> .  For this: <br><br>  - Synchronize RK in Direct with Yagla in one click; <br><br>  - Mark as a substitute element Heading / Subtitle.  It has the most effect on conversion because heading = value proposition; <br><br>  - Group requests by needs. <br><br>  For example, take the query segment by competitors - Rostelecom (screenshot from the Yagla substitution editor): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/097/33a/6ea/09733a6ea1944e0eab9999af33881a39.jpg"><br><br>  3) Based on requests, we pull out the need of this group of users. <br><br>  In this case, the person is looking for a stable wired connection (Rostelecom has no other offers for legal entities).  And where the Internet is an integral part of the work, we need a duplicate line. <br><br>  4) We create USP for a specific group, this micro segment of 3 key phrases.  Namely - we offer "Business Internet" as a duplicate line, an option for safety net.  Users on these requests see the page: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/57c/876/890/57c876890c714772976fe109b3bffa10.jpg"><br><br>  Another example is a group of requests for product features: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/27f/219/c58/27f219c58c814a728f86cd1871207f03.jpg"><br><br>  These people clearly understand what they are looking for and why.  The main criterion is speed.  Fast mobile internet.  Of course, unlimited.  Therefore, in the title we write about the maximum speed and unlimited: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a57/89e/f8d/a5789ef8d6474b9b962ec5a2f8d59614.jpg"><br><br>  As you can see, simple mechanics.  Here is its general principle: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b1c/a68/741/b1ca6874131f4ba3b654b35fcf4bd258.jpg"><br><br>  Accordingly, for each segment the same landing page looks differently. <br><br>  5) This is a very important point: we check hypotheses on offers with the help of a / b tests.  Each substitution compare with the source.  Here, in Yagla, testing is underway until statistical significance is achieved, until the winner is determined.  So we confirm or refute the hypothesis, which is also good. <br><br>  If the source showed a higher conversion, rewrite the substitution and run it again in the test.  There may be several iterations to superiority over the original. <br><br><h2>  results </h2><br><br>  We emphasize that we do not credit these results to something alone.  Here a set of factors worked.  Both optimization of the current campaign in Yandex.Direct, and traffic segmentation with the help of Yagla, and the work of the Beeline team, which promptly implemented our recommendations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/47a/3a4/899/47a3a48996e944389a4bb1870ecab437.jpg"><br><br>  Despite the radical decrease in traffic by 35 times, the number of applications increased by 1.7 times.  Remarkably, this is not a wow-effect, but target leads that are interested in a specific value proposition.  Because a lead is a form of 5 fields, including the company's TIN.  It is still necessary to find it: do you understand what interest it is? <br><br>  We have reduced the total budget in the ‚ÄúBusiness Internet‚Äù direction by 33 times.  What is a hellish nightmare for an agency working for a percentage of turnover.  And a paradise for the client. <br><br>  The rest is under NDA (confidentiality agreement). <br><br>  <b>Instead of concluding the key postulate of the case:</b> <br><br><blockquote>  "The lower the value of the segment you make the value proposition, the higher the conversion to the target action" </blockquote><br><br>  PS On the mechanics of traffic segmentation we recommend our material <b><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/yagla/blog/299636/">"Segmentation of the target audience for contextual advertising: a step-by-step example</a></b> . <b><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/yagla/blog/299636/">"</a></b> <br><br>  PPS Share your comments and thoughts on what you think about in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/303036/">https://habr.com/ru/post/303036/</a></p>
