I have been working as an Internet project manager for more than four years and during this time I have developed a theory that I want to tell you, and perhaps you can help me bring it to practical implementation. <br><br>  This theory will be useful for team leaders, HR managers, project managers, art directors and sales department managers who have a large staff in their subordination whose work results directly depend on the emotional and psychological state of the employee. <br><br>  I was faced with this task when the management asked me the question: how satisfied are my employees and what do I do so that they would become more efficient. <br>  Therefore, I had to evaluate programmers, designers, and copywriters from different angles and, if possible, give a personalized pill for everyone to deliver the project to the deadline.

      There are two solutions - trust your experience and sense of, or "digitize" their colleagues, leading their history of activity. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Employee performance management ($ .ITE)</b> <b><br></b> <br>  The task: the formation of a manager's card, first collecting data for a certain period of time, and then finding the dependencies between these data, defining the "medicine" with which you can improve the efficiency of the manager.  (It looks like BigData, right?) <br><br>  With a large number of managers, a large number of remote offices <br>  the possibility of personal control of each manager as an employee and as an individual is lost. <br>  Next, I took the example of a sales manager and will try to use his example to reveal the essence of my theory. <br><br>  The theory of energy conservation is taken as the basis of the theory: <br><br>  If you look at the manager as a production asset, you can understand that all investments in resources (time (t), money ($), information (i), energy (e)) should be justified and bring more time, money , information, energy company. <br><br>  Consider the input that the Manager receives to a greater or lesser extent: <br><ul><li>  Money ($ 1): salary, bonuses, personal business. </li><li>  Information (i1): training, insider, calls, analyzes, meetings, brainstorming. </li><li>  Time (t1): weekends, holidays, short working days, reduction of turnover (for example, refusal to report, assigning an assistant), the ability to work remotely, volunteers and rallies. </li><li>  Energy (e1): Sport, health, family, friendliness of the team, company loyalty, corporate events, entertainment at work. </li></ul><br>  The presence / absence of these factors positively or negatively affect the output, i.e.  the fact that in the end the company receives from the work of the employee.  Their growth or increase.  The manager in this case is a set of functions that convert the input data so.  receiving output variables ($ 1, i2, t2, e2), and keeping personal variables ($ ‚àÜ, i‚àÜ, t‚àÜ, e‚àÜ). <br><br>  To personal variables, respectively, we assign: <br><br><ul><li>  Money $ ‚àÜ: company profits, number of paid vacations, losses, additional overtime unpaid work. </li><li>  Information ‚àÜt .: personal growth, character development, the acquisition of professional knowledge. </li><li>  Time t‚àÜ: free time, no work after the end of the working day. </li><li>  Energy e‚àÜ: initiative, team </li></ul><br><br>  For weekends ($ 1, i2, t2, e2) or corporate, variables, we can include: <br><br><ul><li>  Money $ 1: the share of participation in the total profit of the company, simultaneously with the growth of the profit of the company itself, KPI, a smaller number of paid vacations, losses, additional overtime unpaid work. </li><li>  Information i2: training other employees, finding new solutions to problems, increasing the number of calls, participating in meetings and exhibitions, working with insiders. </li><li>  Time t2: the speed of work, the solution of goals, the absence / presence of unnecessary negotiations within the company, the increase in the efficiency of calls, being late for work. </li><li>  Energy e2: initiative, team, loyalty manager to the company. </li></ul><br><br>  Time and money are very easy to estimate.  These are quantitative indicators.  Information and energy is more difficult to assess, since there are no quantitative indicators, but you can enter a coefficient showing a deviation from the norm. <br><br>  For example: a person was sick (coefficient e1 = 0.5) but continued to go to work, as he became the manager of a new project.  Its e1 = 0.7.  He was able to rally a friendly team (e2 = 1.3), which worked during the weekend ($ 2 = 1.1).  Based on the law of energy conservation, we find that e‚àÜ = e2-e1 = 1.3-0.7 = 0.6 and at the same time we see that the variables e and $ (in a particular example, and in fact all) are dependent on each other from a friend by some function, let's call it F. Returning to our example, we find that e‚àÜ is equal to 0.6, which is true since  the person was ill, but at the same time he spent his energy on extracurricular work and a new project, while generating $. <br><br>  We write the formulas we received: <br><br>  $ ‚àÜ = $ 2- $ 1 <br>  i‚àÜ = i2-i1 <br>  t‚àÜ = t2-t1 <br>  e‚àÜ = e2-e1 <br><br>  Accordingly, we get a card manager, knowing he spends or generates resources.  After some time, the coefficients can be judged on where his problems and what should be influenced. <br><br>  f ($) = x1 * ($ 2- $ 1) / $ 2 = x1 * $ ‚àÜ / $ 2 <br>  f (i) = x2 * i‚àÜ / i2 <br>  f (t) = x3 * t‚àÜ / t2 <br>  f (e) = x4 * e‚àÜ / e2 <br><br>  where x1, x2, x3, x4 are variables of each person, since  it is not known how the change in input data will affect it ($ 1, i1, t1, e1.) <br><br>  If you look at the value of these functions in time, i.e.  build a graph, where the abscissa axis will be t and the ordinate axis is one of f (), then we get the change in personal variables in time and increase the efficiency and personal profitability of the manager.  From here you can get that: <br><br>  An ideal manager is one whose function of personal variables is a straight line, i.e.  he gives more than he receives, being a generator of a stream of money, time, energy, information. <br><br>  However, based on the formulas it is clear that in the long run it is impossible to be an ideal manager - giving all companies away while in the red.  You can only convert i, t, e to $. <br><br>  Since the company's goal is to make a profit, it is necessary to find the dependence of f ($) on f (i), f (t), f (e).  The most banal - the selection function in Excel. <br><br>  If you are interested, I think I can invent an example of a document on the basis of which it will be possible to try this theory in practice. <br><br>  That's all, waiting for your questions here or by email ivanmorev (at) gmail.com. <br><br>  Cons theory: <br>  The theory does not take into account whether the employee has some level of resources at the time of hiring, but due to the fact that the data will be collected during a long period of time, their influence will be leveled. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293798/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293798/</a></p>
