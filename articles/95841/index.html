On March 31, 2010, going to <a href="http://hp-promo.ru/">hp-promo.ru</a> , I registered on it and activated 7 codes with a total face value of 80 points. <br><br>  UPD <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Made an order for gifts ‚ÄúAutocompressor with a lantern‚Äù worth 50 points and ‚ÄúMultitool Travel Edition (penknife with additional elements)‚Äù worth 30 points.  Concerned about the section "Passport data" wrote a letter to the support service: <br>  "Hello, I ordered the" Multitool Travel Edition "and" Autocompressor with a lantern. "  Do I need to provide passport details to get prizes? ‚Äù. <br>  To which he received the answer: <br>  ‚ÄúGood afternoon, Alexander! <br>  If you have ordered prizes of more than 4,000 rubles, the system will automatically prompt you to fill in your passport data.  Without providing this information further order prizes are not possible.  You ordered: <br>  Multitul 778,80 p. <br>  Autocompressor 1 593,00 p. <br>  Consequently, passport data is not needed. <br>  Sincerely, HP-PROMO technical support. ‚Äù <br><br>  On this and calmed down.  The site says that gifts are sent once at the beginning of the month.  Began to wait.  Also on the website in the rules section it was written that ‚Äúthe duration of the Program: October 1, 2009 - April 30, 2010 (inclusive)‚Äù.  April passed - there are no gifts, well, I think that we did not have time to place my order and send it in May.  May 24, I receive a letter from HP with the following content: <br>  "Good day! <br>  We ask you to send by May 31, 2010.  scanned document (receipt or invoice) confirming the purchase of original HP products. <br>  With respect, <br>  HP
