But when it comes to socially-oriented crowdfunding, then there is much less information.  I would like to talk about those online tools that specialize specifically in social collective investment.  If I missed something - please add. <br><br>  Most often, in the form of dividends, the social investor receives moral bonuses (in the form of joy from the deed and a sense of self-worth) and, in some cases, thanks from the creators of the project.  Many of the projects are in the idea stage, therefore donators / investors have an additional sense of the importance of their contribution - if the required amount is not collected, the project will not be implemented. <br><br><h4>  Crowdfunding for social projects </h4><br>  1. <strong><a href="http://crowdrise.com/">Crowdrise</a></strong> .  If you don't return anything, no one will love you.

      Created on: September 2009 <br><br>  As stated on the site: "Crowdrise is a project to return, collect tons of money for charity and receive incomparable pleasure from the process."  The platform allows you to donate to projects and charity events (for example, marathons), to support the initiatives of individual volunteers.  Donors, in turn, accumulate points, which they can then spend on some goods or movie tickets and participate in the lottery ‚ÄúSpend $ 26 on a water purification project and you will have a chance to win an Ipad). <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  2. <strong><a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/">IndieGoGo</a></strong> <br><br>  On the platform, projects in the field of social entrepreneurship, cultural and educational initiatives, as well as programs of non-profit organizations in the field of health, environment, etc. can find funding.  There are also cases of private help, when a prosthesis is necessary for a bulldog, and a talented free musician, Mike Block, is looking for funds to pay medical bills (and thus collects $ 48,001).  The application does not cost anything, but the platform takes a commission on the funds raised: 4%, if the goal was achieved and the project was financed and 9% - if this did not happen. <br><br>  3. <strong><a href="http://www.globalgiving.org/">GlobalGivingFund</a></strong> <br><br>  Date of establishment: 2002 <br><br>  The most popular international crowdfunding platform among Russian non-profit organizations.  In order to become a regular participant, you must collect control $ 4000 and report back for them.  The platform allows not only to publish projects, but also to modify them, set new goals within the project, add photos and reports.  A significant drawback is the 15% commission that the site charges from the funds raised. <br><br>  4. <strong><a href="http://www.causes.com/">Causes</a></strong> <br><br>  The site has its own chip "Desire".  Everyone can wish something on their birthday, wedding, weekend or in the form of a will and send the link to their friends and relatives.  Only desire it will not be for themselves, but for someone else.  For example, you can ask your friends about $ 500 to a food bank (this amount will provide quality food to 75 families).  You can choose only among organizations or projects accredited by the site.  Thus, more than $ 15 million has already been raised. <br><br>  5. <strong><a href="http://together.ru/">Tuguesa</a></strong> .  We give online <br><br>  Date created: 2011 <br><br>  Tuguez is the first ‚Äúcharitable anarcho-syndicate‚Äù in Russia, as the project participants call themselves.  The project grew out of the community Dirty.ru, where during the fires of 2010 a group of people was formed who coordinated assistance and volunteer resources.  Tuguesa differs from other crowdsourcing platforms in that only 1 share can be passed at a time and the author of the project cannot upload information on its own - this requires the decision of the project organizers.  However, the ‚Äúorganizer‚Äù can be anyone - the project is volunteer and everything depends only on the degree of involvement and one‚Äôs own desire.  Today, Tugeza is the most effective fundraising crowdfunding platform in Russia.  Almost all projects are financed, and the project volunteers personally verify their integrity and make up reporting reports. <br><br>  6. <strong><a href="http://www.rynda.org/">Rynda.org</a></strong> .  Emergency Assistance Atlas <br><br>  Date created: 2011 <br><br>  The project is distinguished by the fact that it does not attract financial resources, but the specific material assistance that physical people or organizations need.  It can be both initiatives in the field of support of vulnerable groups of society (disabled people, retirees, large families who need things, household appliances and medicines) and social projects (theater studios in the regions, projects of non-profit organizations).  The platform was created after the Fire in 2010, when there was a surge in volunteer activity among the population and crowdsourcing was first used massively in Russia. <br><br><h4>  For environmental projects </h4><br>  7. <strong><a href="http://www.ioby.org/">Ioby</a></strong> .  Turns environmental projects into action.  Quarter by quarter <br><br>  The project was created to co-finance local environmental projects.  The project is distinguished by its local focus (works in New York).  The site contains the following statistics: <br><ul><li>  $ 1,74618 dollars raised; </li><li>  101 projects funded; </li><li>  78% of projects funded; </li><li>  2 barbecue grills pulled out of the lake; </li></ul><br><h4>  Social advertisement </h4><br>  8. <strong><a href="http://www.advertactivist.com/">AdvertActivist</a></strong> <br><br>  The platform allows users to finance advertising campaigns of social projects that they like.  The authors of the project give reasonable reasons why to finance social advertising: $ 428 billion is spent annually in the world on advertising, 10 billion - in the UK alone.  Basically, this advertising is commercial, and on such a scale it is simply impossible to compete with it.  In order for the social ideas that really change the world, to somehow reach consumers, they also need advertising support and for this a project has been created. <br><br><h4>  Creative projects </h4><br>  9. <strong><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a></strong> .  New way to support creativity <br><br>  Kickstarter is a platform that allows you to support projects in the fields of art, comics, dance, design, fashion, theater, music, photography, etc. The project authors are 100% owners, which means that no donor, whatever his contribution can not count on the management of the project or on part of the profits.  In the event that the amount claimed by the author of the project is not collected within the prescribed time, the funds are returned to the donors. <br><br>  10. <strong><a href="http://www.s-miru-po-nitke.ru/">With the world on a thread</a></strong> <br><br>  The platform also finances creative projects in the categories of education, journalism, history, joint purchases, design, sports, etc.  Most of the announced projects remain funded by less than 10%. <br><br>  11. <strong><a href="http://www.my-teacher.ru/">The project ‚ÄúMy teacher‚Äù of the ‚ÄúWho if not me‚Äù foundation</a></strong> <br><br>  Created Date: 2010 <br><br>  The ‚ÄúWho if not me‚Äù charitable foundation attracts funding for one of its crowdfunding programs.  Teachers in ordinary schools throughout Russia can send in their applications for the equipment and materials they need and a description of what they do.  The philanthropist can finance any of the applications you like, the Foundation will buy the necessary and take it to the teacher. <br><br><h4>  Social entrepreneurship </h4><br>  Social entrepreneurship sets as its main task the solution of an important social problem with the help of an established business process.  Social business works on self-sufficiency, as usual, but it is distinguished by the fact that all profits go to a social goal or reinvested in the production process. <br><br>  12. <strong><a href="http://startsomegood.com/">Start Some Good</a></strong> <br><br>  The principles of the site are similar to other crowdfunding platforms.  The campaign is allocated 7-90 days, in case the amount was not fully collected, the funds are returned to the donators.  The site welcomes both companies and non-profit organizations, as well as activists who do not have a legal person.  The goal of Start Some Good is to become the best crowdfunding platform in the world, which will launch the innovative ideas we need to change our world for the better.  Projects in the field of microcredit, agriculture, agro-and ethno-tourism are very popular among ideas. <br><br>  13. <strong><a href="http://rusini.org/">Rusini.org</a></strong> <br><br>  It was launched in April 2012 and claims to become the largest online platform for co-financing social projects and start-ups in the field of social entrepreneurship.  While on the site are published mostly purely charitable initiatives. <br><br><h4>  *** </h4><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcrowdfunding is good in itself, but in Russia it faces a number of difficulties (which, however, seem quite solvable): <br><br><ul><li>  Only <a href="http://philanthropy.ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/World_Giving_Index_2011_rus2.pdf">5% of</a> people donate money to charity.  And this means that the response to published projects will be significantly less than in developed countries; </li><li>  there are no adequate payment systems: the lack of PayPal, high commissions and the underdevelopment of virtual money makes the online financing system inconvenient (and inaccessible) for those 5% who are still willing to donate something; </li><li>  no benefits  In developed countries, private donations exempt benefactors from taxes and give them other benefits.  In Russia, this practice is absent. </li><li>  the lack of feedback is exactly what the social projects themselves have to work on.  It is very rare when a donor finds out about the fate of the money he transferred.  But it is on the principles of transparency and trust that the system of ‚Äúprivate financing‚Äù is built. </li></ul><br>  Khabrapost was prepared by Daria Alekseeva, editor of the Greenhouse of Social Technologies portal. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142587/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142587/</a></p>
