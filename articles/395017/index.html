IBM Watson also knows how to <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/ibm/blog/252474/">make recipes for delicious dishes</a> and <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/ibm/blog/273632/">helps businesses</a> . <br><br>  It is time to replenish the knowledge of the system with another profession - an information security specialist.  Starting this month, a joint team of scientists from eight universities in the world will be engaged in training IBM Watson.  Duration of study - a year.  After obtaining a diploma, the cognitive system will be able to help in the fight against cybercrime. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There are a lot of information security specialists in the world.  Virtual threats - even more.  But so far they have been managed through the efforts of specialists.  When a new threat appears (vulnerability in CMS, new malware, etc.), the solution is found rather quickly.  The problem is that these solutions are usually published in corporate, private blogs, private instructions and reports.  Such information is fragmented, and it can be difficult to get it.

      ‚ÄúLet's imagine that tomorrow there is an article about a new type of malware, and then various blogs publish updated data on themselves,‚Äù said Kevin Shkapinets, head of IBM‚Äôs strategic department.  ‚ÄúWhat we do is teach Watson to understand the published information, look for several sources, and find links between them.‚Äù  On various aspects of information security, monthly publications are published in 60000+ information security blogs.  And this is just one data source for IBM Watson. <br><br>  A lot of time is now being devoted to fighting online intruders.  In addition, huge amounts of money are spent.  Businesses all over the world waste millions of dollars just on trying to eliminate false threats.  In terms of time, such a struggle with windmills takes about 21,000 hours in total.  The situation is aggravated by the fact that every day there are all new vulnerabilities that hackers very quickly discover.  At the moment, there are about 75,000 current Internet threats listed in the National Vulnerability Database. <br><br>  Last year, the cybersecurity language was taught by IBM Security‚Äôs own specialists.  They were able to give the cognitive system skills to combat information threat on the web.  IBM Watson studied thousands of documents on this topic, structured information and learned how to use it. <br><br>  Now we plan to speed up the learning process.  This fall, IBM Watson will become a student of eight educational institutions in the specialty "information security".  Watson will begin to study with students at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, MIT students, New York University, the University of Maryland, and other institutions of higher education.  In particular, the University of Maryland, together with IBM, will create the Accelerated Cognitive Cybersecurity Laboratory (ACCL), where students, academics and IBM specialists will deal with various cybersecurity issues. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ae/c16/d1c/1aec16d1c3ae439e84f2b4a8f64cea26.png"><br><br>  IBMWatson after completing your training will help solve the most complex problems in this area.  Throughout the course, the system will receive for review 15,000 books, reports, articles and other types of information each month.  IBM Watson can even get reports on a number of areas of information security in the country.  The system will receive information from the X-Force library.  The information here is only topical, it has been collected for about 20 years, including data on 8 million spam and phishing attacks, as well as 100,000 documented vulnerabilities. <br><br>  All this fragmented information will be collected and ranked by Watson.  At the output, the system will receive a graceful structured database that IBMWatson can use to combat cybercrime. <br><br>  As part of IBMWatson, Watson for Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãSecurity will be provided with a cloud service whose specialization is the detection of new information threats and the search for ways to eliminate them (or eliminate consequences if the threat itself could not be neutralized). <br><br>  You can find out more about what Watsonfor Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãSecurity can do at a <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/security/cognitive/">special webinar</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395017/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395017/</a></p>
