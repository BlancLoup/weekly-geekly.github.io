My name is Daniel.  I am the third year of gnawing granite of science in <a href="http://www.bmstu.ru/">NE Bauman Moscow State Technical University,</a> at the faculty of <a href="http://www.bmstu.ru/abitur/studies-life/edu-programs">Software Engineering</a> .  So there were stars, that this year I came to <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallels">Parallels</a> as an intern on part-time.  Under the cut the story of my evolution from interns to interns. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  At one time, there was an opportunity to touch the <a href="https://park.mail.ru/pages/index/">Mail.ru Group Technopark</a> , which operates on the basis of our university.  At the beginning of the second course I got to them in preparatory C ++.  He completed the test tasks, passed the selection and even learned a little.  But it was a little later than I found myself in Parallels.  Therefore, he decided to remain on the red and white side.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/de8/991/86a/de899186aab4426b988f63546f83c776.jpg"><br><br>  In my first year I came across information that MSTU named after Bauman cooperates with Parallels.  Interested.  He went to our department head for information.  He said that, by a happy coincidence, in our university, an open lecture of one of the company's specialists is planned.  I came.  There were a lot of tasks at the meeting, R &amp; D, R &amp; D and so on.  After the lecture, he met Alexei Koryakin.  As it turned out, he is a graduate of our university.  Talked about programming languages.  I remember telling him that one of the proposed tasks did not make sense to "pit".  At that, Alexey noted that there is no difference for a real programmer in which language to write.  For my part, I replied that a good programmer will always find the optimal language for solving the problem.  So I received an invitation to be interviewed in the company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c9b/887/3d6/c9b8873d6c58427f9807a4c3930c3454.jpg"><br><br>  Came to the meeting.  We met with other team members.  I was not technically interviewed, it was more about soft skills.  They asked what languages ‚Äã‚ÄãI tried and so on.  I don‚Äôt know what I was interested in, but as a result, on June 28 I had the last exam, and on the 29th I was already in Parallels as an intern.  And they began to teach me ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/bd9/74e/176/bd974e17657640ca93b0f093df738ef0.jpg"><br><br>  By the end of the summer, it was realized that during the two months of the internship, I learned more than in a year of studying at a university.  I understood that I want to come here again.  Gone to study.  After six months, he returned to the internship back to Internal Development.  What I want to say thank you to the mentors is that they taught me how to work.  Not for any separate knowledge, but for the fact that they showed how work processes are built, how to systematically build up their activities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/eea/fa2/89d/eeafa289d8094b6cb142c695621b3ffc.jpg"><br><br>  Does work hinder learning?  Not!  First of all, I guess I was lucky, because Baumanka has a rather comfortable schedule.  Secondly, despite the fact that part-time is 20 hours a week, Parallels is a great place to start.  Schedule flexible.  Here they look at what you did, and not for that much time you spent on it.  Combining work and study is simple.  Enough at the weekend to sit on textbooks.  I have not worked really during the session, but I am sure that we will be able to find the optimal solution.  Moreover, my mentors are former graduates of Baumanka themselves. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Life from inside</font> </h3><br>  What is <a href="http://www.parallels.com/ru/products/desktop/">Parallels Desktop,</a> I learned a long time ago.  Once I saw running Windows on a Mac.  I was surprised at the beginning, then explained that not all Windows applications are accessible to Macs.  I remember how impressed with the parallel operation of the two operating systems and the spectacular svayp-switching between systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1c7/7c3/b6a/1c77c3b6aa2c4cadae4744d47cf48ade.jpg"><br><br>  If we talk about first impressions, then after I joined the company, they of course corrected.  First, outside it seems that Parallels is a huge corporation with thousands of programmers around the world, and so on.  In fact, it turned out that the most difficult tasks are solved by a modest development team in Moscow, Tallinn and Malta.  Of course, we have 10 offices around the world, but still.  In this case, all communicate to each other on "You".  It does not depend on the position and age of the interlocutor.  Just here it is accepted.  What you are paying attention to is the friendly atmosphere inside.  Everything is quite comfortable.  I can say that I do not get tired of the very fact of being at work. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">From theory to practice</font> </h3><br>  Until recently, I was given tasks of an abstract nature, not related to work processes.  First of all, to understand the internal cuisine, I think.  In parallel, I wrote my project.  Over time, the dialogues that sounded at the working meetings ceased to be a Chinese diploma for me and they began to entrust me with applied tasks.  For example, now I work with the reporting system.  Everything is as close to reality as possible.  There is a task, it needs to be done.  People around can recommend sources of knowledge.  To say this library, for example, is bad or good, and explain why.  But to give you the path to this library, to say what you need and how to do, no one will.  Nobody will write the code for you here.  Do it yourself!  Find all by yourself.  You develop yourself.  On the part of colleagues, this is similar to mentoring.  There are always people around you who, at the right moment, will say whether you are developing correctly.  At the same time, the whole theoretical part is on you.  Of course, one or another source may be recommended to you, but no one will definitely demand that you study it.  This is your area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility.  Of course, they can explain something to me if it is really incomprehensible, but basically it is self-education.  In general, I believe that the existing practice is optimal.  Otherwise, if there is a hard plan, a person may have a misunderstanding as to why he is given this or that material.  At other times, he may assume that he does not need this knowledge and he will never use it.  At the university, on the contrary, it is elevated to absolute.  When I am taught graphics, for example, I can assume that somehow it builds the logic of thinking, but it‚Äôs unlikely that I will use some kind of graphic algorithms in the future.  I have another goal.  Having a general idea is good, but no more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c8f/18d/444/c8f18d4445e448a9a861bf0da595da12.jpg"><br><br>  Thus, what happens here is different.  You actually choose what you want to learn.  If there is any gap or you feel that knowledge is not enough, you fill them yourself.  At the same time, you understand that you need this area here and now, and not that you will probably need it sometime. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f30/844/ae5/f30844ae59fd4ea6a952f3d9eaf43e81.jpg"><br><br>  Outside, it may seem that you are thrown into the water and thus taught to swim.  Of course, you can drown.  It all depends on how hard you hit the water with your hands.  Everything is relative.  For example, I have fellow students who study in other companies.  And they exclusively study, but do not work.  Someone is engaged in typical student side jobs not by profession.  There are, of course, very advanced classmates.  Along with some, you have to feel somewhat flawed.  But this is the motivation to grow. <br><br>  <b>ZY</b>  Well, some funny photos from the office.  I hope the guys do not lynch me for them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d2e/17b/4a7/d2e17b4a77064d34affbcf4c9385f4b0.jpg"><br><br>  All Parallels employees are given foil caps. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/2ef/411/e37/2ef411e37d284df7941450dafe66f5dc.jpg"><br><br>  Here, all are usually stocked up with vitamins and extra pounds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fa0/9ab/fcc/fa09abfcce774c4484d3606c10278368.jpg"><br><br>  The office has developed cross-booking and other utility. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/269/d1a/86f/269d1a86f6fe4ee8af7ed77fdb2c8b92.jpg"><br><br>  Anything can be found on the two floors of the Moscow office. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a50/2fe/cfb/a502fecfb4b64ee49bbbfc0e1bf52b06.jpg"><br><br>  Here is stored corporate tablecloth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d38/0f6/91c/d380f691c8f948fb8f3e9d03ceef5f0a.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, we have recently opened a Parallels research and practical laboratory in Baumanka.  The walls are decorated with smart people, one way or another connected with the history of the company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/2b6/cf9/c96/2b6cf9c9641f41fab4b4419a521e3d8a.jpg"><br><br>  Bill Gates will not advise the bad! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/67e/84a/259/67e84a25942849c4922ef2c059b4fc69.JPG"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/338512/">https://habr.com/ru/post/338512/</a></p>
