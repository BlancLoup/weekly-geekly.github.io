  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Silence is gold: why mobile spending on Russians has decreased</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="http://www.comcon-2.ru/">Synovate Comcon</a> conducted a survey of users of mobile devices.  In January-June, owners of smartphones and mobile phones began to spend less money on mobile communications.  The costs of the former were reduced by 9.3% - to 486 rubles per month, and the costs of the latter - by 12%.  On average, for six months, Russians saved about 5.3% on mobile communications.  The reasons for what is happening, as it turned out, are not only in the notorious crisis. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In the heat of competition, the operators themselves come up with ‚Äúwin-win‚Äù payment schemes, favorable tariffs, as well as all sorts of service packages, wholesale and retail.  They really managed to attract users in this way, however, the revenue of telecom operators began to fall.  The fall is also facilitated by no less zeal of market players from adjacent segments that distribute free WiFi hotspots and free instant messengers. <br><br>  Operator reports do not leave anything for analysis, except for indicators such as the average score on a sim card or the average monthly bill ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPU">ARPU</a> ).  In Moscow, for example, the number of registered sim-cards exceeds the number of residents more than twice.  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D1%258B">MTS</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D1%258B%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB-%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">Vimpelcom</a> ARPU year on year decreased by 3.3% and 1.5% respectively.

      Some reduction in ARPU "VimpelCom" is a consequence of the mass transfer of subscribers to package tariffs (almost 20% of subscribers now use them), as a result of which it fell in price a minute, explains operator's representative Anna Aybasheva.  An employee of one of the cellular companies believes that ARPU has also declined due to international roaming.  Russians began to travel less abroad.  And those who leave, prefer to do it without further ado. <br><br>  VimpelCom, however, did not lose much, since the decline in indicators on one item of income was offset by growth in another.  The operator‚Äôs revenue from mobile data increased by 19%.  Dmitry Solodovnikov also said that MTS had a shift in revenue towards mobile data transfer. <br><br>  The representative of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25A4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">"Megaphone"</a> Tatiana Zvereva in no hurry to agree with the results of the study.  She admits that among subscribers, the share of smartphone users is growing and the share of mobile phone lovers is decreasing.  Synovate Comcon data testifies to a kind of ‚Äúcirculation‚Äù of users of gadgets: at the end of June 2015, 49% of Russian subscribers used smartphones.  This is 14 pp more than last year.  And the proportion of telephone users decreased by the same amount and amounted to 53%.  However, some Russians turned out to be fans of both gadgets, which explains the distribution of shares with more than 100%. <br><br>  In the MegaFon network, the penetration rate of data transmitting devices has reached 50% in the second quarter of 2015, and the share of smartphones in sales of its company stores has already reached 65%, Zvereva said. <br><br>  Managing partner of <a href="http://www.acm-consulting.com/">AC &amp; M Consulting,</a> Mikhail Alekseev, believes that the stagnation of revenue of Russian operators is expected.  Referring to the experience of developed countries, he predicts a further drop in demand for the services of operators, which can be replaced by Internet applications.  In Spain, already in 2013, more than half of subscribers did not use SMS at all.  The Russian operators are still ahead, says Alekseev. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294180/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294180/</a></p>
