  <section class="page js-page"><h1>thn.gs - in order not to remember</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We have not been able to understand for a long time why everyone is trying to make his own service for managing to-do lists and why we also fell victim to this desire, but the work on <a href="http://thn.gs/">our GTD application</a> , which will be discussed below, helped us come to a hypothesis. <br>  Take a look around, how much do you know about tudu-services?  - Dark.  Do you use any?  - Probably.  But are you all happy with it?  Probably no. <br>  Surely you know a lot of flaws in the service with which you work every day, but continue to use it because you still have not found anything better.  If you are a developer, the day comes when you realize that the time has come to ‚Äúsharpen the saw‚Äù and you begin to make your task manager.  Wait, but why? <br><br>  We are convinced that the need to keep and manage to-do lists is one of the most fundamental in modern life.  It is as fundamental as, for example, the need to write messages to other people, create documents, or view media.  This need comes from the need to <i>remember</i> something.  People like to know, people like to make decisions based on knowledge, but people <i>do not</i> like to keep small incoherent details in mind.  People <i>do not</i> like to remember.  As far as this niche is wide, so is it heterogeneous.  Just as people cannot always find the perfect browser or email client, people cannot find the perfect tudu-service.  Partly because many products are imperfect, partly because many products do not correspond to the internal perception of this problem by the user, because  created to follow someone else's methodology. <br><br>  For centuries, paper has been used to memorize anything.  She performs her role well for two reasons: first, she, as you know, can endure everything, and secondly, she does not impose anything.  In other words, paper combines functionality and simplicity.  Deeply imbued with this idea, we made our product. <br>  What do we mean by this?  Einstein said, ‚ÄúMake it as simple as possible, but not simpler.‚Äù We, following this principle, implemented all the fundamental tools of case management, but at the same time we made them as general and unobtrusive as possible.  That is why, if you need some tool, then you can use it in relation to any subject area, and if you do not need it, then you may not even notice its existence.  Those.  we do not impose a methodology, we just give a set of perfectly sharpened tools.

      Further less common words and more technological details.  The picture is selectable. <br> <a href="http://thn.gs/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/d16/a5c/585/d16a5c585d9aaa3fcb20d8a7152ef4da.png" width="723" height="517" alt="Smthngs"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  To keep the task lists is not enough, you still need to manage them.  In our opinion, there are not many business management tools: <br><ul><li>  Hierarchy.  Combining tasks into projects and subprojects, into a tree of unlimited depth. </li><li>  Tagging  Any task or project can be assigned many tags and then using them in the filter and search. </li><li>  Delegation.  Any task or project can be shared with friends or colleagues. </li><li>  Tricks  You can assign focus to a task, grouping by urgency and importance. </li></ul><br><br>  By unobtrusiveness, we mean that the user should not even see controls that he is not interested in at a given time, so as not to be distracted by them.  That is why we love drag and drop so much.  For example, to create a project and place tasks in it, there is no need to press any buttons; you only need to drag one task to another.  Similarly, you can assign a label, share a task for another user, or change the focus. <br>  We try to simplify any process within the system.  To delegate a task to a user who does not have an account, just enter his email in the field above the list of friends and drag the task to the item that appears with his avatar in the list.  A friend will only need to click on the link in the letter to create an account, log in and see the tasks.  (If the user already has an account, in order to fumble for tasks on him, it is first necessary to obtain permission from him.) <br><br>  Designing a good interface is not enough; you need to somehow make it work on the web.  Web interfaces have always been in the shadow of the desktop ‚Äî always simpler, less functional, less dynamic.  We immediately decided not to put up with this injustice, and do everything right. <br>  One of the main problems of the web is Lt.  No matter how fast the Internet is, the user will always be annoyed by even the smallest delay in interface hiccup, which can usually be caused by two reasons: the network delay and the re-creation of the entire document at the moment of clicking on the link.  To solve these problems, we implemented all the interface logic inside the browser.  Completely and completely.  The application is designed so that virtually any user action does not require waiting for a response from the remote side, and therefore any such action is performed without any visible delay.  The task of the server with this approach is only to provide a very simple (and open) API for data synchronization. <br>  Another equally important problem of the web is connection dependency.  No matter how fast the Internet is, it is often unstable and not available everywhere, especially if it is a mobile connection.  Fortunately, modern web technologies allow you to create web applications that can work offline.  The only problem is that in order to create such an application, you need to fully implement the interface logic on the client, but ... we have already done this, as you remember.  By the way, I know only two web services, besides ours, which can work offline. <br>  To ensure that the data displayed in the web interface is always relevant and alive, we use web sockets, but this, since the launch of frendfidick, will not surprise anyone. <br><br>  We also understand the importance of mobile applications.  We recently made a <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dgs.thn">client for Android</a> .  It uses the same open API as the web version.  A little later, the author will tell about the application in a separate post - eterverda <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/eterverda/" class="user_link">habraiser</a> .  We are also working intensively on the iPhone application together with the edl00k <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/edl00k/" class="user_link">habrauser</a> and hope that it will see the light soon.  If you want to sign up for beta testing - <a href="">write to us</a> . <br><br>  We have <a href="http://twitter.com/smthngs">twitter</a> and <a href="http://facebook.com/smthngs">facebook</a> , you can use them for their intended purpose. <br>  The service itself is <a href="http://thn.gs/">thn.gs.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144489/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144489/</a></p>
