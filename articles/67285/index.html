  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Improving performance: how I got rid of insomnia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many IT pros have trouble sleeping.  Below is a description of my problem and the method by which I solved it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/580/7e1/222/5807e12225dcd10528c8fb740a29dda8.jpg" alt="image" align="left"><br>  A few weeks ago I received three large orders at once, each of which was tightly limited to terms.  The projects were really interesting and well paid, so for the first few days I worked with almost no sleep.  Naturally, the performance began to decline.  It got to the point that I began to catch myself on the fact that for a few minutes (!) I ‚Äústupidly stuck‚Äù into the monitor, while not doing anything, and even not noticing my out-of-state. <br><br>  Then I decided: everything, it's time to get enough sleep.  Having kept everything ‚Äúas it is‚Äù, I went to bed ... and realized that the problem was not solved at all. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After lying in bed for about an hour, I decided to use the old proven method.  He took out a boring thick book and began to read.  After twenty minutes of reading, I almost fell asleep, but as soon as I thought about it, the dream slipped away again.  Throwing a venture with a book, I again lay down in bed and fell asleep only in the morning.  Surprisingly, I woke up in just four hours.

      So I suffered a few more days.  At the same time, consciousness was in a state of half sleep all the time.  I saw everything around me as if through a translucent white film.  Sounds muffled, dull sensations. <br><br>  In short, insomnia is when you‚Äôre not really asleep, and you‚Äôre not really awake <i>¬© "Fight Club"</i> <br><br>  Then I began to try various folk remedies: counting sheep, taking a shower before going to bed, drinking milk with honey, etc.  I admit, sleep is really improving, but not much. <br><br>  But two methods (for some reason, very little-known) produced a stunning effect.  Both methods are based on the <b>smooth</b> discharge of consciousness from thoughts.  After all, insomnia, as is known, is a consequence of emotional over-excitement.  These are the two methods. <br><br><h2>  Method 5-4-3-2-1 </h2><br>  Lying in a comfortable position, find 5 things that you see.  It can be both real surrounding objects, and those that are in your imagination.  I need to say to myself ‚ÄúI am aware of what I see ...‚Äù - this is the case for each item. <br><br>  Next - 5 things you hear.  Next - 5 sensations. <br><br>  Then the cycle repeats with four objects, with three, with two and with one. <br><br>  It is amazing that I never got to one thing - the dream came very quickly. <br><br><h2>  Method "throw out of my head" </h2><br>  This method may seem ridiculous and ridiculous, but it works flawlessly. <br><br>  Lying in bed, imagine that your head is a saucepan, and thoughts in it are pieces of paper.  Realizing that you are thinking about something, mentally take the visual image of this thought, crumple it up, and get it out of your head.  And so - until thoughts remain in my head.  It takes me 5-10 minutes for this method. <br><br><h2>  At last </h2><br>  In conclusion, I would like to write that these two methods relieve the symptom of insomnia, but the root of the problem remains.  Moreover, despite the fact that in my case they work 100%, it‚Äôs not a fact that they will work just as well for others. <br><br>  Therefore, <b>if the topic is interesting to the habrasoobshchestvo, in the near future there will be a more detailed post</b> about insomnia, as well as a number of topics on how to improve their own performance. <br><br>  Nevertheless, if at least one person will help this post (which I sincerely hope for) - it will not be written in vain anymore :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67285/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67285/</a></p>
