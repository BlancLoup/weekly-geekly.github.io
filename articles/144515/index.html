  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Competitions car-robots in Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A few years ago, the educational <a href="http://robosport.ru/about/">program ‚ÄúRobotics‚Äù</a> appeared in Russia.  According to this official site, it includes 3 main areas: <br><br>  GENERAL ROBOTICS - mechatronics, robotics and high technologies in the system of general education and hobby <br>  PROFESSIONAL ROBOTICS - mechatronics, robotics, high technologies in the system of professional education;  identification and promotion of promising personnel for high-tech industries <br>  INNOVATIONS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP - promoting the implementation of youth innovation and entrepreneurial initiatives, self-employment of young people in the field of high technologies;  creation of high-tech businesses by program participants <br><br>  I will focus on professional robotics.  Within this direction, 2 main types of competitions are held: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Robofest - competitions of mobile robots in their classes, qualifying competitions for participation in the Asia-Pacific robotic competitions ABU ROBOCON. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Robocross - unmanned robot cars competition.  About them today and will be discussed.

The competition was held (for the first time in Russia) on July 18, 2010 at the Seliger 2010 youth innovation forum. The participating teams represented such universities as: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Moscow Automobile Institute, <br>  ‚Ä¢ Kovrov State Technological Academy, <br>  ‚Ä¢ Saratov State Technical University, <br>  ‚Ä¢ Ryazan State Radio Engineering University, <br>  ‚Ä¢ Nizhny Novgorod Automechanical College, <br>  ‚Ä¢ Nizhny Novgorod State University.  Lobachevsky. <br>  One of their sponsors (‚ÄúTechnovision‚Äù) also presented his Gazelle for participation. <br><br>  According to the rules, cars had to autonomously (without operator participation) to perform 3 tasks: <br>  ‚Ä¢ drive straight from point to point - the task was a qualifying race <br>  ‚Ä¢ drive along an U-shaped trajectory - approximately 100 by 30 meters <br>  ‚Ä¢ Drive along a complex curve with a total length of about 400m. <br><br>  The track was set by road cones, placed on the track.  The participating teams could have passed the route in advance and removed the coordinates of key points for their cars - the main navigation system was GLONASS / GPS (a mandatory condition of the competition) - <a href="http://www.geostar-navigation.com/navigation_05.html">Geos-1M</a> .  Another prerequisite was the presence of an emergency stop system (similar to the E-STOP system). <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/92d4OIVysgw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgkwjGUXi_PAf3A9GNP59Ltfr2n9A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The locations were as follows: <br>  1. <a href="http://redeyes.jcod.ru/">Red Eyes</a> (Kovrov State Technological Academy), the captain of which I am. <br>  2.

This time the rules became more complicated. <br>  The tasks included not only the autonomous version of the movement of the vehicle, but also manual: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Driving offline in a straight line and stopping - qualification. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Movement in manual control mode - "intelligence."  It was necessary to arrive at a point with given geographic coordinates (coordinates were given out half an hour before the race).  At this point was the subject that needed to be identified, and transfer its image. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Offline movement along a curve (also defined by coordinates of nodal points), with a total length of 500m - ‚Äútransportation‚Äù. <br><br>  There were obstacles on the track, the corridor width in the narrowest places was about 3m (with an average error of a GLONASS / GPS receiver of 10m).  The movement from point to point passed along an arbitrary path, taking into account the obstruction of the obstacles.  Estimated accuracy and time of the route.  Detection and obstruction of obstacles was performed in all different ways - someone used a laser scanner (sick) and built a map of the area, someone used an ultrasonic rangefinder (working on a priznipu: I see an obstacle, I start to turn until the obstacle movement zones). <br>  Requirements for navigation and emergency stop systems have not changed. <br><br>  This time, in addition to the Gazelles, homemade vehicles and cars took part.  7 vehicles were able to pass the qualification. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c9a/8d7/f3f/c9a8d7f3fd74c3284060a9fdce0dcb78.jpg"><br>  <i>Vehicle built using electric bicycle wheels and vision systems.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/49b/75f/28d/49b75f28d677eee1c37d82bb993ef9e1.jpg"><br>  <i>The team of the Ufa State College of Radio Electronics.</i>  <i>Unfortunately, their car lost control and crashed into an obstacle out of the race.</i> <br><br>  Prizes coincided with last year's: <br>  1.
