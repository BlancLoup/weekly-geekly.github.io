This is knowledge of the general nature of positive human reactions.  David Hume called such a nature "permanent and universal principles of human nature."  Universal design rules may not always be the measure of all things, but they can help to achieve success in various areas of activity, including communications, manufacturing, services, technology, art, and environmental design. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="http://net.onextrapixel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/lawsandprinciples.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Only the product that is created taking into account these rules is the highest-quality demand from consumers.  The main points of these rules can be applied in art, in architecture, in photography, in interior design and even in such communication technologies as advertising and website design.  The initial goal of the design is the aesthetic appeal of the product, while for the competitive embodiment of design ideas it is simply necessary to understand the processes that affect human perception. <br>  Design rules that will work for you:

      <b>1. Occam's razor</b> <br><br>  Occam's razor (or the law of minimum assumptions) - a law formulated in the 14th century by the Father of the Church, William Ockham, who was ahead of his time.  This law is not an indisputable truth, scientific progress can do without it, but, however, it shows that most often the correct solution is the simplest solution.  To put it another way, the simplest explanation or theory is preferable, and they often prove to be correct. <br><br>  <i>There is no need to multiply the existence without the need.</i>  <i>The multitude should not needlessly become the main evidence.</i> <br><br>  As noted by Leonardo da Vinci: "Simplicity is the highest refinement."  With regard to design Occam's razor warns that it is necessary to avoid unnecessary complexity both in design and in the presentation of information. <br><br><img src="http://net.onextrapixel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/ockham.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A simple, intuitive solution is the goal and all excesses should be mercilessly eliminated.  It is necessary to strive for such an outcome as the consistency of execution. <br><br>  Read on: <a href="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2010/07/occams-razor-a-great-principle-for-designers/">Occam's Razor: A Great Principle for Designers</a> <br><br>  <b>2. Hick's law</b> <br><br>  Hick's law was proposed by the British psychologist William Edmund Hick in the 1950s and is an indirect confirmation of Occam's razor.  This law states that the greater the choice, the longer and more difficult the decision-making process will be. <br><br>  <i>Decision time increases depending on the number of possible choices.</i> <br><br>  Just imagine how easy it would be to buy a pack of chips if there were only three or four kinds of this product on the supermarket shelf.  The more complex the selection process, the higher the level of stress and nervousness in humans. <br><br><img src="http://net.onextrapixel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/hick-law.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A long and varied selection process can cause an emotional reaction, in which it will seem to a person that all options are bad.  This proves once again that simplicity is the most productive.  A limited number of buttons, panels and alternatives will attract the visitor, he will return to your site and begin to actively participate in its activities.  The richer the choice, the greater the headache.  If the choice is limited, the likelihood of correct understanding increases.  In any case, from the user's point of view. <br><br>  Read on: <a href="http://www.vanseodesign.com/web-design/fitts-law-hicks-law/">How To Improve Usability With Fitts' and Hick's Laws</a> <br><br>  <b>3. The Fitts Act</b> <br><br>  The Fitts Act is a product of the thought of Paul Fitts, who in 1954 described the relationship between the amount of time required to move to a target, the size of this target, and the distance to it.  The easier it is to find a target and the shorter the distance, the faster and easier it will be to move to that goal. <br><br>  <i>T = a + b log2 (1 + D / W), where: T is the time, a is the start / end time, b is the movement speed, D is the distance, W is the target width or the permissible error.</i> <br><br>  Website designers create large central buttons to draw attention to these buttons, and make less significant buttons less large.  This principle also works for other cases. <br><img src="http://net.onextrapixel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/fitt-law.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You can push a site visitor to an unconscious choice of action by increasing the size of one button, and also making it the easiest and closest to click. <br><br>  Read on: <a href="http://sixrevisions.com/usabilityaccessibility/improving-usability-with-fitts-law/">Improving Usability with Fitts' Law</a> <br><br>  <b>4. Fibonacci sequence</b> <br><br>  The Fibonacci sequence, named after Leonardo of Pisa, which was also known as Fibonacci, was recreated at the beginning of the 13th century, but it was previously seen in the works of old Indian mathematicians.  The list of numbers continues by adding the last two sums.  It starts with 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, etc.  Interestingly, this sequence is also manifested in nature.  For example, in branches of trees, in petals and leaves of very many plants, as well as in the behavior of bees. <br><br><img src="http://net.onextrapixel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/fibonacci.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Observers subconsciously find such designs the most aesthetic.  In fact, many people consider this sequence to be the most important model in both mathematics and design.  It can be successfully applied in the creation and geometric patterns, and organic ornaments, and visual images, and even for individual compositions. <br><br>  Read on: <a href="http://www.bestcodingpractices.com/fibonacci_and_golden_ratio_in_web_design-39.html">Fibonacci and Golden Ratio in Web Design</a> <br><br>  <b>5. The golden ratio</b> <br><br>  The golden section is actually a mathematical variation of the Fibonacci sequence.  The golden ratio is an irrational mathematical constant, equal to approximately 1.6180339887.  This law was already realized more than 2000 ago, but for the first time its definition was proposed by Euclid.  The golden section justifies the preference of choosing the proportions of forms and structures so that they look the most attractive. <br>  ‚ÄúGeometry has two treasures: one of them is the Pythagorean theorem;  the other is the division of a line into a golden section.  The first is the precious metals of geometry, the second is its precious stones. ‚Äù  - Johann Kepler <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe golden section is as follows: most of one segment refers to a smaller part of the same segment, as the entire segment belongs to its larger part.  This proportion describes the relationship between the long and short sides of a rectangle. <br><br><img src="http://net.onextrapixel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/golden-ratio.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Postcards, playing cards, movie posters, and even the most ordinary switches will win and subconsciously please the tastes of users, if they have these proportions.  They can be used in design, advertising, art and many other areas of professional activity. <br>  The golden section, which is also denoted by the Greek letter œà (psi), is considered the ‚Äúconvenient‚Äù proportion that surrounds us everywhere, and the eye perceives it as the most correct and most proportional ratio. <br><br>  As a designer, you can use this proportion when arranging elements on your pages and create mini-rectangles that are pleasant for perception according to the rules of the golden section.  These can be captions under pictures, advertising space, control panels and menus.  It makes sense to first build everything in your imagination, and then transfer the invented rectangles to your pages. <br><br>  Read on: <a href="http://designshack.co.uk/articles/graphics/applying-the-golden-ratio-to-your-web-designs">Applying the Golden Ratio to Your Web Designs</a> <br><br>  <b>6. Rule of Thirds</b> <br><br>  The rule of thirds may seem the same golden section, but, in fact, it is not the same thing.  This law was first established in 1797 in John Thomas Smith‚Äôs book ‚ÄúNotes on a Rural Landscape‚Äù.  Smith regarded his discovery as a generalized rule, and not as an absolute law.  However, in reality, it turns out that if designers do not neglect this law, the results are the most attractive for most users. <br><br><img src="http://net.onextrapixel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/rule-of-thirds.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If the drawing, whether it is computer graphics, painting or photography, is divided into nine blocks with imaginary horizontal and vertical squares, the lines and the intersections of the lines will become the most significant parts of the work.  In addition, the division of the pattern into heaven and earth, or sky and water along one of the three horizontal lines is also preferable to dividing it in half.  Such a disproportionate division as it concentrates energy and attracts interest. <br>  For artists and designers, an understanding of the rule of thirds can lead to an increase in audience interest in their works. <br><br>  Read on: <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/05/29/applying-divine-proportion-to-web-design/">Applying Divine Proportion To Your Web Designs</a> <br><br>  <b>7. Pareto's Law</b> <br><br>  The essence of the Pareto law or the 80/20 rule is well known to all who lead teams, meetings or students in the classroom, even if the leader does not know that this is Pareto's law. <br>  Pareto's law states that no matter how many events occur, 80% of the results will be in 20% of the effort. <br><br>  Joseph M. Juran in 1906 named this phenomenon in honor of Wilfredo Pareto, who showed that 80% of the land in Italy owns 20% of the population of Italy.  This law has become an explanation of why 80% of criminals commit 20% of all crimes and why 20% of all who use the health care system use 80% of all its services.  Otherwise, why 80% of the result falls on 20% of the action. <br><br><img src="http://net.onextrapixel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/pareto.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For practical use on the website, the instruction may be as follows: if 80% of visitors use only 20% of the information provided, columns, buttons, etc., then everything that is not used should be reduced or replaced with more effective one.  This solution is supported by Occam's Razor, an irrational approach to ease of use. <br><br>  Read on: <a href="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2011/02/the-8020-rule-applied-to-web-design/">The 80/20 Rule Applied to Web Design</a> <br><br>  <b>8. Mental models</b> <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe law of mental models has always been vital among scientists with rich imagination, and in 1943 this law was formulated by Kenneth Kreik.  He suggested that the human mind reproduces small mental models that are used to evaluate events.  And indeed, it becomes much easier to learn something, if you build everything on an already familiar model.  Computer design comes up against this when it introduces familiar terms such as desktop, files, and folders into word processing programs. <br><br>  Every time you can use familiar experience as a model or instruction for further development, the possibility of successful use increases and the level of stress decreases. <br><br>  <b>9. Possibility of error</b> <br><br>  The possibility of error, also known as error design, is a concept that seeks to reduce the number of unavoidable problems and negative consequences from accidental or unintentional actions.  Again, if the design is coordinated with Occam's Razor and the law of simplicity, then the tendency to err can be reduced, but it still needs to be taken into account. <br>  The simplest placement of information and items, as well as warnings, can prevent the negative results of wrong actions.  In the computer world, a reminder before pressing a button may cause the user to change his mind and not commit an erroneous action. <br><br>  <b>10. Signal to noise ratio</b> <br><br>  The signal-to-noise ratio is relevant to determine the balance between the message and the background noise, which can limit or weaken the message value.  If the proposed ratio is 1: 1, this means that the background noise is almost equal to the strength of the message.  In this case, the results are lower than expected. <br><br><img src="http://net.onextrapixel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/snr.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The adjustment may consist in the selection of the main element, which can be both sound and visual.  It may also include reducing or removing distracting sounds or visual disturbances. <br><br>  If you allow important and useful information to take the main place and reduce the level of unnecessary and useless information, it will bring you positive results. <br><br>  Read on: <a href="http://www.vanseodesign.com/web-design/signal-to-noise-ratio/">What's The Signal to Noise Ratio Of Your Design?</a> <br><br>  <b>11. Permanence and variability of laws of use</b> <br><br>  The constancy and variability of the laws of use are simple universal principles with a wide scope of application.  They contribute to the rapid promotion of goods on the market with the help of a diversified assessment of their capabilities and shortcomings.  It is necessary to forget both about the feeling of superiority and the feeling of inferiority, and to create something together with other people.  One mind is good, but two is better. <br>  We need to work together with those who still know less and less experienced.  Advertising that promotes the whole team will be more effective and the time spent on creating the design will surely pay off. <br><br>  <b>12. Law of perception of information</b> <br><br>  The law of perception of information practically speaks for itself.  If information or instructions are not presented in an accessible form, then this information will be ineffective and there will be no positive action from it.  In most cases, the best directions are the shortest and simplest.  The equal use of audio and video formats, including graphics and text, can make the instructions more informative and at the same time uncomplicated for perception. <br><br>  Using a variety of items to explain important instructions, directions and information keys works for you. <br><br>  <b>Other valuable universal design rules</b> <br><br>  Perhaps you would like to consider other principles, such as the equal use of nearby objects and the law of physical effort.  There are many cases in which these laws can play an important role as part of the design process. <br><br>  Understanding that ‚Äúthere is one common consciousness for each individual‚Äù (RV Emerson) means that the better you understand human nature and what drives our perception, the more successful your design will be. <br><br>  Maybe you know other rules that help you succeed in the field of design? <br><br>  Original article: <a href="http://www.onextrapixel.com/2011/06/09/12-laws-and-principles-to-aid-you-in-your-design/">12 Laws and Principles to Aid You in Your Design</a> <br>  The translation was done by the <a href="http://bigideas.ru/">BigIdeas</a> project <a href="http://bigideas.ru/">translators</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/123336/">https://habr.com/ru/post/123336/</a></p>
