Modern online stores (and even more so marketplaces) are puzzling a potential buyer with such a mountain of irrelevant products that sometimes you may want to contact the good old specialty store with two options and an expert seller. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tc/mn/le/tcmnlenle0d5luh_4gno5cgdyym.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's try to look at the problem from the side of specialists, who by all means try to improve sales in their online store.  With the growth of the range, the search becomes a key component, the stability and quality of which affects the profit directly. <br><br>  In other words, the ‚Äúonce, once and in production‚Äù strategy can have a tangible effect on the density of the hair covering of the responsible individuals.  And constant testing and, excuse me, enough coverage is a very good way to the world of good unicorns and cloudless trouble-free.  But how?

      Consider possible alternatives (the author allowed himself to simplify some points, in order to attract the sister of talent). <br><br><h4>  AB testing </h4><br>  We sit down together and handle the main search queries.  Top1000 will be enough?  Or maybe better than Top10000?  And what if a significant percentage of profit is buried in the long ‚Äútail‚Äù of rare requests?  Oh, and for each new increment you need to repeat everything? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ay/up/zz/ayupzzwrmk7ffasvmqkqxtc65zq.png"><br><br><h4>  F-measure (Precision / Recall) </h4><br>  Actually, it is necessary to try to answer two simple (at first glance) questions: <br>  How many products from the selected are relevant?  (Precision) <br>  How many relevant products are selected?  (Recall) <br><br>  Minute of boredom: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nt/kb/_u/ntkb_ugnaxrjugxcec9cdt6gwos.png"><br><br>  The difficulty is obviously in the need to know which products are relevant for each specific request.  In essence, this is a ‚Äúgolden set‚Äù of search results, with which it is necessary to compare current results.  There are a lot of such sets (for every request we are interested in), moreover, the sets are not static: the emergence of new products or the end of sales of old ones is an unequivocal reason to rebuild the ‚Äúgold sets‚Äù.  At least within the same category. <br><br>  In a word - not the easiest way.  From the word very. <br><br><h4>  Clickthrough rate (CTR) </h4><br>  CTR must always be monitored, but in the context of the task in hand, this is the case when, if something noticed, it is still too late.  Helpful?  Of course.  Solves the problem?  Definitely not, because it‚Äôs better to know about the problem before the buyer finds out about it. <br><br><h4>  Subjective assessment of relevance? </h4><br>  Very interesting, but how?  And, most importantly, by whom?  Crowdsourcing with random and cross validation?  Girls from HR department?  The case when you really want to call the good kind robots and load them with work on the most unbeatable.  Robot is not hard! <br><br>  Wait, stay, it's all good, but can it be the same, but easier and cheaper? <br><br><h4>  Clear intentions greatly simplify the assessment of search quality. </h4><br>  Intent-based search is no longer news, but how can intentions help to simplify and, most importantly, automate the search check?  Consider a simple example, someone really wants to buy a Leatherman Skeletool.  These keywords uniquely describe a specific product (omit the color). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-z/jx/xf/-zjxxfiyt2ibzhqigu3-nhrwhos.png"><br><br>  So, having a completely unambiguous desire, a person goes to an online store in the hope of placing an order as quickly as possible (who is interested in wasting time on insignificant trifles).  Note again: the search query uniquely describes the desire of a person.  Moreover, the query seems to be quite sufficient to validate the search. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wn/71/hg/wn71hgaon54ktp5yhxquugoz-is.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://www.walmart.com/search/%3Fquery%3Dskeletool%26cat_id%3D0">Walmart</a> , by the way, could have done better. <br><br>  Are there any other similar requests that clearly describe the intentions of the buyer?  In fact, there are a lot of such requests.  Summarizing, we can distinguish at least two classes of search queries: <br><br><ol><li>  Requests with a unique name for a specific product </li><li>  Inquiries with a unique brand name and a specific product </li></ol><br>  Thus, it is not so difficult to create a fully automated tool for basic validation of a search solution.  The percentage of buyers with clear intentions is large enough (depends on the specific store), moreover, it is the buyers with clear intentions who quickly lose their patience without getting what they want.  Another example of unopposed results is Maxxis Bighorn: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qw/n_/7j/qwn_7jcspqet2tsoh76qvla51l0.png"><br><br><h4>  Bad strategies or Skelita comes to you </h4><br>  By the way, "negative options" are very important important.  For example, if there are not some products in the store assortment, you should not ‚Äúfind‚Äù them.  And even more ridiculous <a href="https://www.mvideo.ru/product-list-page-cls%3Fq%3Dskeletool%26region_id%3D1%26limit%3D12">are the results</a> obtained by unnecessarily simplifying the original search query (a very old approach, by the way): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kg/1i/ju/kg1ijuteoo0ib4ugsjhvhcbhlou.png"><br><br>  Recognizing and working properly with the buyer's intentions is the key to success.  The next article will be devoted to automated tools and significant budget savings for testing.  Qualitative search without a large team of testers is quite real. <br><br><h4>  miscellanea </h4><br><ul><li>  At the time of writing, no search service was harmed (but many turned red). </li><li>  <a href="https://www.mvideo.ru/product-list-page-cls%3Fq%3Dskeletool%26region_id%3D1%26limit%3D12">‚ÄúBad‚Äù search in Mvideo</a> </li><li>  Funny people can take <a href="https://github.com/RenatGilmanov/modular-cartoons">here</a> . </li><li>  The author does not recommend buying a skeletool (fragile), and tire standards :) </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/423619/">https://habr.com/ru/post/423619/</a></p>
