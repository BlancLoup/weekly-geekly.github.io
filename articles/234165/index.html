To be more precise, researchers of biochemical strategies for adapting a person to a stressful situation from the South Ural State Medical University (we just like very much how proudly and impressively the phrase ‚ÄúChelyabinsk scientists‚Äù sounds). <br><br>  Research is conducted on the basis of the Department of Biological Chemistry by the leadership of the head of the Department of the Doctor of Biological Sciences, Professor Vadim Zeylikman.  The project involves both teachers and students, and the latter are allowed from any courses.  The main use of Synesis software is video tracking in the Open Field test. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/104/824/146/104824146491463c82f0a411da79a9a7.jpg" align="left">  What is the essence of the experiment?

Maybe someone will touch it, but in humans and rats such changes occur in a similar way.  But on the people experiences do not have to put. <br><br>  The test consists in the quantitative measurement of the components of the behavior of a white laboratory rat, which is placed in a completely new space (arena) from which it still cannot get out on its own.  The arena is a well-lit, round space with a diameter of 1.2 m, enclosed by high walls (45 cm), the floor is marked by radial and circular lines - divided into sectors.

      It is known that the movement of animals in space is not chaotic, but structured.  The structure of the route is determined by the species-specific and linear behavior patterns, depending on the gender, age, individual experience of the animal, the nature of the investigated space, and the impact that the animal underwent just before testing. <br><br>  By the way, about the impact.  Where does animal stress come from?  Now in the course of the experiment, the main way of "intimidating" rats is that they are put on sawdust, which the cat urinated.  No wonder animals are nervous. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/642/bc1/3cf/642bc13cf0d74326be60f3fd05e4025b.jpg" align="left">  The new environment - the arena - activates in the rat a complex set of reactions, including the desire to defend, hide, and the desire to explore a new territory.  It is the position in which the balance of the animal‚Äôs experiences is located that determines its behavior. <br><br>  As a result of exposure to external irritants in rats, a certain level of anxiety is created, the manifestations of which are established during the course of the experiments.  As a rule, in rats with a high level of anxiety there is a low motor (vertical and horizontal) activity, frequent episodes of fading, as well as avoidance of the central part of the arena when moving in an open field.  Animals with a low level of anxiety, in contrast, are very active, move quickly throughout the arena, often stand on their hind legs and look into the burrows. <br><br>  In addition to the trajectory of movement, the number of central and peripheral sectors crossed by the rat is taken into account.  All these indicators taken together provide basic information on how these or other influences affect the emotional state of the tested animals. <br><br>  The entire course of the experiment is recorded on a video camera placed above the arena.  Then the video is processed with the help of our program CasRetail (by the way, most often it is used in the field of retail, for whom it is interesting - the <a href="http://synesis.ru/solutions/cassiopeia">link</a> ).  As a result of processing, an image is obtained with the trajectory of the animal.  Since the experiment began quite recently, and now researchers are in the process of calculating indicators, it‚Äôs too early to speak about the results (using specific figures as examples). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/64a/127/87b/64a12787b1b34f85bbef81ef2034e2dc.jpg" align="left"><br><h5>  What gives our video tracking? </h5><br>  First, the track visualization itself is an automatic plotting of the animal‚Äôs movement in the arena. <br><br>  Secondly, the ability to assess mobility in different areas of the arena.  The heat map shows the time at which the test mouse stops at various places in the arena. <br><br>  Thirdly, the calculation of numerous indicators that characterize the movement of animals (speed, tortuosity of the path, stops, preference turns in any direction, etc.). <br><br>  And finally, increasing the objectivity of the registration of the behavior of the rat. <br><br>  This is how our solutions help young biochemists.  We cheer for them and look forward to scientific discoveries! <br><br>  The experiment has just begun, so expect to post with the results! <br><br>  UPD: here is an example: the horror of the animal looks like a track and a heat map: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5b4/d7a/076/5b4d7a0760a3472c934bec3c03ca606b.png" align="left"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0a7/ea8/ef5/0a7ea8ef57844d46ae83008581a761ea.png" align="left"><br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/234165/">https://habr.com/ru/post/234165/</a></p>
