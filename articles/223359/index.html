The tower turned out to be a masterpiece and the next 40 years in the world could not build anything like it. <br><br>  Few people know, but the construction of the Eiffel Tower is not the limit of 19th century engineering; it is just a leap above the head - engineers could not think of anything like eiffel either before or 30 years later (until the Shukhov tower was built in Moscow in 1922).  And all because Eiffel stole his election from nature.

And while the bone for some reason does not break under the weight of the body. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/033/b42/881/033b4288191f5b7c7cac32dc80f80a21.jpg"><br>  <i>Thigh head incision.</i>  <i>In the spongy substance, oriented structures are visible, corresponding to the functional load on the bone.</i> <br><br>  Von Meyer discovered that the head of the bone is covered with a sophisticated network of tiny bones, thanks to which the load is miraculously redistributed over the bone.  This network had a strict geometric structure, which the professor documented. <br><br>  In 1866, the Swiss engineer <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD,_%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BB">Karl Kulman</a> put the theoretical basis for the discovery of von Meier, and 20 years later, the natural distribution of the load with the help of curves calipers was used by Eiffel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/08f/b85/fb7/08fb85fb70aa07ef667ffa14c20a8d4c.jpg"><br>  <i>With the opening of the exhibition, the world was shocked by the technical superiority of France over the whole world.</i>  <i>The French went into the lead by two generations!</i> <br><br>  Forty years later in 1939, the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinkel_He_178">He-178</a> , the first aircraft with a turbo-jet engine, took off.  It was possible to insert the turbine into the jet engine thanks to the special shape of the blades of the Eiffel Tower type.  There, by the way, the whole story with these blades - each of them is as complicated as a space station but is grown from a single crystal!  Google it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7d0/bc2/69a/7d0bc269adbaa104f0f67382a9638240.png"><br>  <i>The modern <a href="http://agromashdetal.ru/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8-OPRA-Turbines.pdf">gas turbine engine OP16 is</a> built around ‚ÄúEiffel technology‚Äù: the aerodynamics of a single-stage centripetal turbine was maximally worked out to achieve a wheel efficiency of 90%.</i>  <i>The turbine blade section has a ‚ÄúEiffel Tower‚Äù type design with a strong root part and a relatively thin and light peripheral section that allows reaching high peripheral velocities (about 700 m / s) on the periphery of the blades without an extremely high level of stress.</i>  <i>At the exit from the guide vane, the speed of a uniform flow of heated gas is about 690 m / s.</i>  <i>Since the difference between the two speeds is insignificant, in the peripheral section of the turbine blades there is no flow deceleration and due to this increase in temperature.</i> <br><br>  This is the way of technology of slanting supports in the history of engineering science.  Eloquent in her time built the Eiffel Tower.  The French really needed to create an engineering miracle and they created it, being ahead of time by 40 years, when the technology found massive use.  Now small ‚ÄúEiffel towers‚Äù ‚Äã‚Äãstand in each plane and rotate the turbines of each power station - that is, they are everywhere present in our life. <br><br>  Simply put - the world exhibition of 1889 was the magnifying glass of a kind of time machine.  Indeed, the vocation of exhibitions is to demonstrate the future.  If you, of course, know how to see.  Now imagine that you can purposefully dedicate the exhibition to the nearest future and show its prototypes - this is how you get the ball of robots. <br><br>  In the future at an exhibition you get from a threshold - on a tatka you come into the room where you are surrounded with robots, tens of various robots.  About how in Moscow 2040th. <br><br>  Visitors are greeted by a big-eyed Japanese robot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fda/369/7b9/fda3697b9877d1a196f6eb2697e8f5ab.jpg"><br><br>  He recognizes the children and starts hugging them. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Oj5SghKosmg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhC_mhMZ1zByX2kAoWUZmqudX2dfw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  To the left of the entrance is a class of robotics, here parents take children away from their parents and teach them how to assemble a robot from lego by designing nodes on a computer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/52d/13a/764/52d13a764e151b1528fbdb24bb9b6d35.jpg"><br><br>  Adult entertainment a little further - a hand with a conventional ballpoint pen draws a face that it recognizes from a webcam.
