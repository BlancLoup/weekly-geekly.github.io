England. <br>  Widely known as the author of Flask and Jinja2.  Armin will give a talk on ‚ÄúAdvanced Flask patterns, fully updated since EuroPython 2012. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://cecinestpasun.com/">Dr.</a></b>  <b><a href="http://cecinestpasun.com/">Russell Keith-Magee</a></b> , <b>President of the Django Software Foundation, member of the Django core team, TradesCloud CTO.</b>  Australia. <br>  Russell will make a presentation on building a developer community through the lens of his DSF experience, and also will talk about some technical aspects of the Django device (ORM). <br><br>  <b><a href="http://holgerkrekel.net/">Holger Krekel</a> , founder of the PyPy Project, author of the popular tools py.test and tox.</b>  Germany. <br>  The subject of the Holger report is ‚ÄúRe-inventing Python packaging and testing‚Äù: Python still doesn‚Äôt have a built-in installer that can install dependencies.  You have to install setuptools / distribute and then use easy_install / pip.  Installation of packages is slow and depends on pypi.python.org and other servers.  For example, it was not possible to verify that it was an automated test passing.  There is not really a way to run tests.  This is an out-of-the-box version. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://justcramer.com/">David Cramer</a> , DISQUS High Load Specialist.</b>  USA <br>  DISQUS is one of the largest web projects written in Python;  It withstands more than 500 million users per month.  David will talk about scaling projects on Python: the right practice and the rake, which come on projects during its growth. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://progrium.com/blog/">Jeff Lindsay</a> , hacker-philosopher, developer, architect.</b>  USA <br>  The founder of the largest US community center for hackers Hacker Dojo, the organizer of the world famous hackathons SuperHappyDevHouse.  Participated in projects CommerceNet, NASA Ames, Twilio and others.  In his free time he talks about the Evented Web and teaches programming.  At PyCon Russia, Jeff will introduce the topic Distributed Service Architectures with Python. <br><br><h4>  Russian speakers: </h4><br><br>  <b>Andrei Svetlov, Python Core Developer, co-organizer of PyCon UA.</b> <br>  <i>"PEP 3156 - the standard for asynchronous operations in Python."</i> <i><br></i> <br>  Python already has a lot of network programming libraries.  The most famous are twisted, tornado, gevent, medusa / asyncore.  These systems are not compatible with each other, which makes it impossible to write cross-platform libraries working in any event loop.  PEP 3156 offers a new generic standard that all developers can support. <br><br>  <b>Andrei Vlasov, IDE PyCharm developer at JetBrains, author of the funcparserlib and iterpipes libraries.</b> <br>  <i>"Static Analysis of the Python Language"</i> <i><br></i> <br>  Static analysis allows you to get information from the program source code without executing it.  We will look at the available tools for static code analysis in Python (PyLint, PyFlakes, Pep8, IDE inspections) and talk about what problems they can automatically find in the code.  I will talk about the approaches on which the static analysis in these tools is based; I‚Äôll focus in more detail on the specifics of Python analysis as a dynamic language.  The report will introduce static analysis tools, which, by using them in everyday practice, can reduce the number of problems in Python code (errors, exceptions, stylistic differences). But it will also let you know about the theory behind the static analysis tools and get acquainted with the features of static analysis languages ‚Äã‚Äãlike python. <br><br>  <b>Mikhail Korobov, Python developer, speaker of various Python conferences.</b> <br>  <i>"How to switch to Python 3?"</i> <br><br>  I'll tell you how things are going with the transition to the 3rd python, why go on it and how (in my opinion) to go on it.  Knowledge can be put into practice on the same day, jointly porting a library or two as part of the evening workshop / sprint.  I hope that after the report and workshop each person will have (or systematized) the skill of porting code to Python 3. This skill will soon be needed, for example, in order to read the code of most popular projects (even if you write at 2.x) .  Well, the benefit for world civilization has not been canceled. <br><br>  <b>Roman Imankulov, developer Doist Inc.</b>  <i>"Celery for internal API in SaaS infrastructure"</i> <br><br>  The main task of Celery is to perform background tasks.  As a rule, celery processes use the same code base as the main application.  I suggest taking a look at Celery from the other side and try to use it as a transport to connect the components of a distributed application.  The report will provide concrete examples of the implementation of the Celery API, discussing the issues of routing requests to workers in connection with this.  It will also be mentioned, why Celery is so good for building an internal API, and in what situations its use may seem redundant.  Listeners will learn how to quickly and without unnecessary overheads connect the components of a distributed application into a single whole, get rid of strong connectivity, and perhaps look at your own application from a slightly different point of view.  It is assumed that students are familiar with the concept of message queues, and represent in what cases and for what Celery or similar solutions can be used. <br><br>  <b>Alexander Koshelev, Development Team Leader, Yandex.</b> <br>  <i>"Dissection of asynchronous code operation"</i> <br><br>  What happens inside an asynchronous code?  What happens when logic becomes cpu-bound?  Is it possible to make a hybrid synchronous asynchronous architecture?  I will try to answer these questions using the example application on Tornado.  I will visualize the work of the application and suggest ways to solve some problems. <br><br>  <b>Konstantin Lopukhin, CTD</b> <br>  <i>‚ÄúAn Approach to Data Versioning in a Relational Database‚Äù</i> <br><br>  I want to talk about the problem of versioning data in a relational database - where such a problem arises, possible choices and solutions.  I will tell you more about the approach based on intervals, which allows you to work in the system at any time in the past, to roll back the entire system or its individual parts.  The approach is implemented in a small library of documents for Django, but the principle itself is easily portable.  I will consider the application of this approach both for traditional applications and for constructing a versioned EAV database representing data in the form of a graph. <br><br>  <b>Danila Shtan, head of the development of the holding 66.ru</b> <br>  <i>"UWSGI as a python-web-developer Swiss knife"</i> <br><br>  uWSGI, which began as a fast container of applications on python, gradually evolved into an infrastructure solution not only for launching, but also for developing applications in general (and not only in python).  Unfortunately, the lack of documentation often repels developers and system administrators from using uWSGI.  My report is aimed at people (both developers and sysadmins) who have practical experience in deploying python web applications in a production environment that are ready to consider alternatives to the chosen solutions.  In addition to becoming familiar with the application server itself, we will look at additional features (for example, caching or performing background tasks), which often allow (especially in small projects) to reduce the number of used third-party technologies like memcached or celery. <br><br>  <b>Denis Kolodin, Software Analyst, Forum IC</b> <br>  <i>"Low-latency and soft-realtime in Python"</i> <br><br>  The report will cover the development of high-speed software with predictable reaction times.  It will also present ways to integrate Python using ctypes and cython with high-speed services of the operating system.  The issues of memory management, processes, threads, fibers and GIL are addressed.  Students will understand how to build systems with expected response times.  Knowledge can be applied to the development of servers serving multiple clients at the same time or performing high-speed data processing. <br><br>  <b>Dmitry Prokofiev developer, Yandex</b> <br>  <i>"The evolution of data synchronization between services"</i> <br><br>  The report will tell you why Yandex needed data synchronization and what was encountered in the process: Why we synchronize at the application level.  Update log vs Insert log.  DB related issues.  Data types, no transactions.  Problems with Django.  Problems associated with changes below the application level.  For example mass update. <br><br>  <b>Mikhail Yumatov, Senior Developer, Trilan</b> <br>  <i>"SaltStack"</i> <br><br>  SaltStack is a tool for parallel execution of commands on servers, where commands are functions in Python.  In the report I will try to explain why you should pay attention to SaltStack, even if you are already using Chef or Puppet, than it can be useful.  I'll tell you how we use SaltStack to automate the deployment of projects and pay attention to additional pleasant features, such as the notification system between servers, the system of user rights and some others. <br><br><h4>  Master Classes </h4><br><br>  <i>Note: a master class is a work format for 4 hours, when participants come with their laptops and work under the guidance of a master on a practical task.</i>  <i>The whole theory of the issue is studied immediately with practical examples, which are carried out by the hands of the participants.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  <b>Konstantin Lopukhin, CTD</b> <br>  <i>‚ÄúMaster class: we write our interpreter using RPython‚Äù</i> <br><br>  At this master class we will see how bytecode interpreters are organized (almost all interpreters for modern dynamic languages ‚Äã‚Äãare exactly like these), what advantages does RPython provide for implementation (used in PyPy), and how JIT (just-in-time compiler) works.  The practical part will consist of the implementation of several small parts - the implementation of a new byte-code, the addition of just-in-time compiler, analysis and improvement of performance.  Participants will learn what parts the interpreter consists of and how they work, how JIT works, why TDD is good, and then they can write a fast interpreter for a small dynamic language over the weekend. <br><br>  <b>Andrei Svetlov, Python Core Developer, co-organizer of PyCon UA.</b> <br>  <i>"Master class on creating network applications from scratch"</i> <br><br>  Many programmers wrote asynchronous code using ready-made solutions.  The purpose of the master class is to show how this all works ‚Äúunder the hood‚Äù.  It will be interesting to those who have already written network code using ready-made libraries or to those who want to learn how to do it.  Participants will gain knowledge of the basic principles of creating asynchronous network libraries, starting from a low level and ending with user-friendly structures. <br><br>  <b>Mikhail Korobov, Python developer, speaker of various Python conferences.</b> <br>  <i>"Workshop on porting to Python 3"</i> <br><br>  Practical application of knowledge gained during the report. <br><br><img src="http://ru.pycon.org/img/logo.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Organizational matters: </h4><br><br>  Conference site: <a href="http://ru.pycon.org/">ru.pycon.org</a> Reduced ticket prices are <a href="http://ru.pycon.org/">valid</a> until the end of January.
