  <section class="page js-page"><h1>UFO mission STS-75</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Flight Space Shuttle STS-75 was not lucky at least twice.  At first, many years before the start, some jokers invented a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/251926/">‚Äúreport on checking sexual positions in weightlessness,‚Äù</a> for obvious fake by putting the number of the mission from the future.  By chance, this number was STS-75, whose crew turned out to be purely masculine.  Then, already during the flight, the routine live broadcast with the MCC, which showed the detached <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/285782/">satellite on the cable,</a> became a very famous "evidence" of UFO sightings.  We <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/284634/">can hardly prove anything to</a> convincing conspiracy theorists, but you will agree that it is curious to know how experiments on board, the imperfection of video equipment and some physics created the myth about the observation of aliens. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ca/674/2f3/9ca6742f36a840a3909148f62a7baddd.jpg"><br>  <i>Round "UFO", a frame from video STS-75</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The imagination and diligence of people who believe in UFOs is enough to stabilize the video, draw the movement paths of objects, apply cunning filters and count the pulsation period.

      But let's look at the original video.  What is happening there?  A few days before the shooting, when the cable was unwinding, it broke, and the satellite flew away.  But, since the satellite with the cable remained in a similar orbit, they regularly flew near the shuttle, they could be watched, photographed and filmed.  And when the distance between the shuttle and the cable was about a hundred and fifty kilometers, the astronauts Franklin Chang-Diaz and Claude Nicolier took the camera and began to shoot the cable during a communication session with the MCC on live television, that is, on the ground they took the picture and could communicate, and the viewers still added the voice of the commentator.  We'll see the original video without processing (from 2:48) <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ujcSwuRBXRc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Strange, but the negotiations do not contain any surprise or excitement of meeting with the unknown. <br><br><blockquote>  Franklin: &lt;inaudible&gt; get an image? <br><br>  MCC: Franklin, we see a long line, something like stars, and a lot of something floating in the foreground.  Can you describe what you see? <br><br>  Franklin: The long line is a cable, and here we have a little garbage that flies with us, it is illuminated by the sun, at such a small angle, a lot of ambient light, Claude is trying to tune the camera. <br><br>  MCC: Accepted. </blockquote><br>  So, for astronauts, the moving points in the foreground are debris flying near the shuttle.  And where did he come from?  The answer is simple.  First of all, the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/246952/">shuttle's toilet</a> is designed in such a way that solid waste was stored and returned to the ground, while liquid was thrown overboard into space with a special system.  Secondly, it was specifically in this mission that experiments were conducted with an additional discharge of water.  Therefore, the shuttle, which did not change the orbit, was surrounded by a huge number of small ice floes.  The astronauts in the post-flight press conference show a very beautiful discharge of fluid and footage of the flight surrounded by pieces of shimmering ice (from 2:04) <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jk8N4vnArCY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Why is the picture so bad?  In the yard in 1996, good technology, which would remove the color image in HD quality and send it right there through the satellite repeater, has not yet been invented.  Of course, the aliens decided to take advantage of this and fly around until people could shoot anti-gravity patterns on the flying saucer cover. <br><br>  So let's say we really see trash.  But how did he turn into circles with holes in the center and some notches on the sides?  If you have a mirror or a mirror-lens telescope, you could already guess.  For example, in my Newton reflector I observed similar ‚Äúplates‚Äù dozens of times, only I had them with a thick ‚Äúleg‚Äù.  If you direct the telescope at a bright star and defocus it strongly, then instead of a star you will see the surface of the main mirror.  A black circle in the center is a secondary mirror. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d4/a21/b5a/4d4a21b5ac73404b848220360a5f00f7.jpg"><br>  <i>"Leg" - mount secondary mirror</i> <br><br>  Honestly, I could not find the specific model of camera and lens used in that flight, but the mirror-lens lens, which is logical to use for shooting distant objects, will give just such a picture for point-like objects during defocusing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3f4/c33/774/3f4c337742084ba786950dbad3080d8a.jpg"><br>  <i>Example of a lens / mirror lens</i> <br><br>  The video clearly shows how the operator changes the degree of zoom and focus of the lens on a cable that is more than one hundred kilometers away in difficult shooting conditions.  A close shallow and bright piece of ice in such conditions will be out of focus.  The protrusions on the periphery of the "UFO" - this is obviously the attachment of the main mirror.  If the mechanism is still incomprehensible to you, a visual experiment is shown in the Hunters History Channel UFO episode devoted to this event (from 5:41). <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DdDE4B2A5DI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  If you were attentive, you might have noticed that the close "UFO" passes as if behind a cable.  So can not be near?  Not.  Video shot in difficult conditions of abundance of ambient light, overexposed (unduly exposed).  Objects in the frame are brighter than in reality, and there may be an illusion of their wrong position relative to each other.  Similarly, astronauts of the Apollo program on the Moon suffered, being, as it were, inside a camera, between a layer of photographic film and crosses painted in front of a photographic film.  The experiment with the overexposed frame and the different position of the fishing line in reality and on the monitor can be seen in the video above (from 6:50). <br><br>  Well, and probably the last question that may arise - why are the ‚ÄúUFOs‚Äù flickering?  There may be several answers to this.  Most likely, the pieces of ice just rotate.  In those moments when the camera reduces the zoom and changes focus, the pieces of ice become almost dots, and it can be seen that some of them retain flickering.  But there is another option - those who remember monitors and TVs with cathode ray tubes, know that the screen does not seem flickering to the naked eye.  But if you shoot a working monitor on the camera, then the running strip will be visible - the camera is different from the eye and has time to notice the operation of the sweep system.  The original video was most likely filmed not on a digital matrix, but on a Vidicon - matrix in 1996 already were, but were used almost exclusively in cameras.  The original signal was most likely recorded on tape and then digitized to get on YouTube.  In conditions when the video has changed several formats and types of media, I would not be surprised at any flickering. <br><br>  A couple of years ago, I <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/245884/">put the</a> parameters I liked into the Drake formula, and I got that there should be about 3000 alien civilizations in the galaxy.  But, fortunately or unfortunately, we have not yet recorded any reliable evidence of their existence. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373177/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373177/</a></p>
