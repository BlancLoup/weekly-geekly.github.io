  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Talk about food stamps?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I live in California for the eighth year, I work, I earn my money, I save for the house.  I am an immigrant in the first generation (in the sense that I was born in Ukraine).  In the nineties, when the poor Ukrainian reality was picked up by my parents and my sister and I were taken first to the promised land, and then to the USA.  When I was 18 years old, two weeks after arrival, I was given the choice of whether to go to work / study or go back to Israel / Ukraine.  Having swallowed bitter teen tears, I decided that an almost caught crane was still better than a long rotten tit. <br><br>  Well, okay, the lyrics aside, I just want to say that it‚Äôs good in the states for someone who wants to live better.  There are no problems with work.  I am 19 years old with no education, only with enthusiasm I began to receive quite a decent salary.  Of course, this is rather an exception to the rule, but if there is a desire, there will be work.  Get off, learn English, make connections, enter the desired circle and porshik just around the corner.  In general, everything is injected here.  Someone more, someone less.  Those who hate food stamps for some reason more.  The reasons are quite clear - why should I work from morning till night, pay 30% of taxes, and my neighbor doesn‚Äôt spend days on end and goes to Mac Donalds?  Did you know that you can eat hamburgers with crispy fries on food stamps every day?  So I was surprised too.  If you are so poor, and you can‚Äôt find a job for what year, why should you be fattening?  Eat bread, milk and potatoes.  Damn, even I can not afford to eat at McDonalds every day! <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      My good friend has a distant relative alcoholic.  My husband is also an alcoholic.  Two kids brought and live on welfare.  A friend is outraged, he says, I spend $ 40,000 a year on my child, and they are all free of charge, on taxpayers' money.  So among the working population, there is a perception that welfare and unemployment are pure freebies.  The minimum salary in California is $ 8.25 per hour, and it is quite possible to live on this money.  Not to glam, but not to do anything at all.  If you make some minimum effort, you can easily get 12 and 15 per hour.  But do not want the same.  One of my friends has been living on unemployment for the second year already.  He receives a check for $ 600 every two weeks and is not blowing.  More precisely on the realtor learns. <br><br>  As it was rightly noted here, immigrants have a difficult fate - since there are no roots on this continent, everything must be obtained by oneself, literally tearing it with the teeth of fate.  By the way, this is a note for those who sleep and see how they will be given a personal piston and a house and a half hectare upon arrival in the states.  Figley.  You will have to start from the bottom - and only perseverance and firmness of character will bring success.  This is the way the reason why many return.  They say that the people here are not the ones, the country is not the same.  But in reality it is difficult to immigrate psychologically and physically.  Not everyone is on the shoulder. <br><br>  So it goes.  And you're talking about poor Americans at food stamps. <br><br>  PySy: welfare this soc.  allowance.  Unemployment is unemployment benefit, paid as a percentage of the last salary, maximum $ 2,000 per month. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136788/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136788/</a></p>
