The basics</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I will not reveal anything new for experienced marketers, but I will try to explain the basics of marketing on analogies with the kitchen.  As they say, you won't spoil the porridge with butter, which is not the case with seasoning.  Seasoning can make the food tasteless to the inedibility, and may reveal all the flavors, so that even the most ordinary dish will resemble a culinary masterpiece.  Same thing in marketing. <br><br><img src="http://i23.fastpic.ru/big/2011/0617/c7/bb404a74ff06476681f8d010eb3ea9c7.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Children ice cream, his woman flowers.  And look do not confuse </h5><br>  A good housewife, like a good cook, always knows for whom she will cook.  And, accordingly, makes a menu of consumer preferences.  If you know that after an hour or two, a hungry friend who, for example, does not like onions and has lactose intolerance, will visit you, it is unlikely that you will begin to prepare a cheese and onion soup for his arrival.  In business, in the same way, you should know who your consumer is and prepare the dish according to his taste and his preferences.  The template phrase about ‚ÄúThe path to the heart of a man‚Äù can be easily interpreted as ‚ÄúThe path to the heart of the consumer lies through what it is and how you offer it.‚Äù <br><br><h5>  The cannibal's third commandment: raw hot does not happen </h5><br>  When a noisy company goes on a hike, it finally makes the evening halt and cooks kulesh on divorced fire, fries sausages and begins to eat, this simple food for some reason seems very tasty.  Why?  After all, kulesh is salty, sausages are unsweetened.  Everything is very simple - the same rules apply in the forest as in the market jungle. <br><ul><li>  Firstly, there is a unique selling proposition and no competition, because the store is far away, and the nearest U Abdul cafe is even further. </li><li>  Secondly, the tourists were directly involved in the preparation of the dish, someone was collecting firewood, someone was peeling potatoes.  In the market jungle, an example is the issue of shares on the market and if a person bought them, took part in the development of a company, then he will buy the goods and / or services of this company, since he is financially dependent (in the case of tourists, the dependence is hunger) and, more importantly, he took part in the creation of the company. </li><li>  Thirdly - this, of course, is the correspondence of the atmosphere in which the tourist receives the product.  These are the smiles of his friends, and Kolyan plays the guitar so well, and the crickets are filled with cicadas, and the fire is peacefully crackling, and the flames play with flames.  Meeting the consumer‚Äôs expectations, whether going to the forest or to the store, is essential.  Suppose a man walks into a store in the market jungle, and there the sellers roll their eyes and shrug their shoulders with a silent expression on his face "Here, damn, again Vasya came ...", and the floor is dirty, the spider concretely settled in the corner on its web, the music does not play at all, but it‚Äôs audible as a tape recorder chews up the tape.  Such an atmosphere can also be harmonious, the buyer thinks, but I, in fact, wanted to buy myself a wedding dress, and not a bunch of brutal things.  And if in this market jungle there is at least minimal competition, at least someone sells tail coats, the buyer will go to competitors, or even run away. </li></ul><br><h5>  ‚ÄúThat's what I don't like cats for.‚Äù <br>  - You just do not know how to cook them </h5>

      Before we start cooking, we must know and / or understand the recipe.  What in what quantity, what quality, in what sequence and most importantly how to cook.  We must have all the ingredients ready.  Nobody starts cooking kebabs in nature when meat is not yet purchased.  Before you start your business, think about what you need for it and how quickly you can organize it.  Pay attention to the obvious things, such as: time, delays, cost, competition, and make a plan.  Sometimes people make mistakes in organizing their business, which, when interpreted at the household level, look curiously: <br><br>  <i>"Oh no!</i>  <i>I'm late for a meeting, if I don't come to him, I will lose the company!</i>  <i>10 minutes left, if I hurry, I‚Äôll just have time.</i>  <i>Taaaaks, cook carpaccio and work "</i> <br><br><h5>  Porridge butter will not spoil </h5><br>  Oil, of course, can also be spoiled, but you need to try hard, but it is easy to over-salt it.  Same thing in marketing.  There are so-called proven methods - add oil mask, a little salt, a little pepper and you can eat.  But what if instead of the ordered dish in an expensive restaurant, they bring you just boiled buckwheat porridge, put two cooked sausages on top?  In fact, buckwheat is delicious and sausages are cooked, but why does this cause bewilderment?  There are three main reasons: <br><ul><li>  <b>Actually the dish.</b>  When a person orders an expensive dish, he knows that the products from which it will be cooked will be of high quality, that not the ketchup from the supermarket will be served with him, but the sauce prepared under the guidance of the chef, the dish will ‚Äúopen‚Äù and start playing with different shades of taste that will be provided by the use of seasonings that are not obvious to the layman </li><li>  <b>The delivery method</b> is the same interior, the atmosphere that was set by the restaurant owners, the courtesy and competence of the waiter, the people who sit at the next table, the music that plays. </li><li>  <b>Expectations</b> - when a person comes to eat, he expects to be fed quickly, tasty and affordable.  But this is only the tip of the iceberg, in fact, the expectations can be very individual.  Perhaps the guy leads the girl to an expensive restaurant in order to make an impression.  A businessman is looking for new acquaintances that will help his business.  Someone is going to quarrel or, at a minimum, be perturbed (regardless of the quality of the services provided).  Someone else is coming because here he made an offer to his future wife and here they are celebrating a golden wedding together.  Someone because he likes the waitress and he feels good when she looks at him, talks to him, etc.  If you think about it, then the expectations and the reasons why the consumer goes exactly to you, and not to competitors, can be both many and one. </li></ul><br>  Marketing, advertising and PR as a product exist to identify these causes, and if they are not there, create them based on the expectations of potential consumers, bring the services provided in line with their desires, come up with a reason and organize a story about it.  The era of ‚Äúvparinga‚Äù and ‚Äúvtyuhinga‚Äù is already ending, as can be seen from the level of distrust of advertising, the end of this era is the beginning of a new one.  An era in which marketing is no longer able to replace the main course, but will be able to present it in all its glory. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/123107/">https://habr.com/ru/post/123107/</a></p>
