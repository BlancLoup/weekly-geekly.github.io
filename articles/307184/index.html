I confess that the second idea was much harder for us, because the task was desperately nontrivial: to find an ideologue who is always in the background in such large projects.  Since June 27, we have received many options for a possible ideologist of this campaign.  Basically, all the ideas circled around the employees of the corporations Nintendo, Google (now Alphabet), The Pokemon Company or the global advertising agencies that serve these corporations.  But for many days we could not find any specifics. <br><br>  The turning point was a careful study of the investors of the company Niantic labs, which we were advised to do by experienced colleagues engaged in long-term investing in securities. <a name="habracut"></a>  Excerpts from the official blog Niantic from February 25, 2016, which describes the entry of an investor with extensive experience in advertising: <i>"... I am pleased to announce that a number of partners have joined us ... They all invest, but more importantly, each brings unique strategic resources to our team.</i>  <i>David Jones and his company 'You and Mr Jones' invest unprecedented knowledge of new technologies in building brands ‚Äù</i> ( <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/niantic-inv/">source</a> )

David Jones. <br><br>  <b>Why do I conclude that David Jones is the ideologue, and not someone copied his seeding scheme?</b> <br>  The answer is simple: you can duplicate it, but not so simple, since the possibility of direct access to the world's largest mass media is earned mostly not even with money, but decades of building relationships with key players in this market - editors-in-chief and journalists. <br><br><h3>  PR campaign for Pokemon Go </h3><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/306522/">You can read the</a> study of the PR campaign <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/306522/">in the first article</a> . <br><br>  After a comprehensive study of the issue, we believe that the ideologist of the campaign for Pokemon Go is David Jones.  In short: <br><ol><li>  David had a reason to do this project personally, because  He is a direct investor in the company Niantic labs. </li><li>  David Jones has extensive knowledge of branding and advertising technologies, including viral mechanics, as well as knowledge of political PR technologies and successful experience in this. </li><li>  He has excellent acquaintances with the entire elite of the world media market, experience of interacting with the media for the largest advertising and PR campaigns in the framework of work in HAVAS World Wide. </li><li>  Experience of successful promotion of commercial brands in a similar seeding scheme.  In particular, SONOS and One Young World, cited above. </li></ol><br>  For those who are not familiar with the topic of ‚Äúsowing viral information‚Äù, I recommend watching videos from the Cannes Lions 2015 festival. Starting at 30 minutes, it will be about sowing (distribution): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DaoHKFcWuUk8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoHKFcWuUk8</a> <br><br>  We tried to contact David, but for many years in high advertising positions we were taught him not to publish his e-mail.  Having sent letters to all available addresses, we have not yet received comments. <br><br>  If it turns out that I am wrong and someone else is the ideologue of the campaign, I will publicly ‚Äúsprinkle ashes on my head‚Äù, apologize to the person and continue my research.  My confidence is ninety-five percent.  But only for the reason that the author did not confirm his involvement in the work on the PR campaign.  Therefore, five percent still laid on a probable error. <br><br><h3>  The purpose of this article </h3><br>  To <u>bring the PR campaign</u> to its ideologist David Jones (an investor in Niantic labs) and invite him to Ekaterinburg for the possible holding of his forum ‚ÄúOne Young World‚Äù in 2017 or 2018. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/307184/">https://habr.com/ru/post/307184/</a></p>
