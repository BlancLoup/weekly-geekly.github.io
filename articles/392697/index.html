Now for the same purpose special chemicals are used, but they pollute the soil, the products themselves and are more expensive. <br><br>  When the project was implemented in the field, the plant resistance to fungal diseases increased by 70-80%, the yield increased by 30-40%, and the number of diseased tubers and fruits decreased by 70-100%. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.findpatent.ru/patent/257/2570624.html">A patent for the strain</a> has already been received, now the team is working on a patent for a biological product.

Now more often use special chemicals that lead to pollution of the soil and the plants themselves.  Therefore, in the last few years, a new method of protection has begun to develop - with the use of biological products based on microorganisms and their metabolic products. <br><br>  The share of such drugs is insignificant, but in connection with the requirement for environmental protection and non-pesticide protection technologies, the search for new drugs is now relevant.  In the southern regions of Russia, including the Astrakhan region, the environmental situation is worsening.  Unreasonable use of chemicals worsens the situation.  The assessment of the territories of the arid zone (irrigated agriculture zone) of the South of the European part of Russia and the CIS countries with a similar climate showed that anthropogenic disturbances exceed the rate of natural recovery processes and led to a decrease in ecosystem stability. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/253/8aa/863/2538aa863e0ca64ce00d1f31f3d28569.png" width="600" alt="image"><br>  <i>Frost &amp; Sullivan and RVC, <a href="http://www.rusventure.ru/ru/programm/analytics/docs/20141020_Russia%2520Biotechnology%2520Market_fin.pdf">"Review of the biotechnology market in Russia and assessment of its development prospects"</a></i> <br><br>  New products contain natural strains that are safe for all ecological niches, but have a pronounced activity against phytopathogenic fungi, insects and viruses.  In Russia, Professor I. S. Dzerzhinskaya and M.F.  Koryazhkina, but further development of a laboratory sample of a biological product and testing it on agricultural fields was not developed. <br><br>  Microbiologist, graduate student of Astrakhan State Technical University <a href="https://www.facebook.com/di.tremmor">Dinara Baubekova</a> developed a biological product based on a strain of a microorganism of the genus Bacillus.  At the first stage, a collection of strains was collected, then they were examined for various properties, and a suitable "candidate" was selected.  A biological product is tried in action on agricultural fields on various crops - solanaceous and melons with different planting terms. <br><br>  Besides the fact that the active bioagents affect the plant in order to protect against fungal diseases and stimulate its growth, they activate regulatory mechanisms in agrobiocenoses (aggregates and organisms living on agricultural lands).  The drug has no phytotoxicity, it has no effect on warm-blooded animals and is environmentally friendly. <br><br><blockquote>  How it looks in practice: we spray the vegetative parts of the plant with a biological product, we spill the soil with a biological product - under the plant root.  Uniform distribution protects the plant from pathogens of fungal diseases and contributes to the formation of a special fungicidal field.  <i>Dinara Baubekova, drug developer</i> </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f0e/ab0/854/f0eab0854a2a57d0049d20ea2d35cb44.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/538/67b/c10/53867bc10ce52a460766b08886084e82.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  When the project is implemented in the field, the following occurs: <br><ul><li>  increasing the resistance to fungal diseases (Alternaria, anthracnose, downy mildew) by 70‚Äì80%; </li><li>  yield increase by 30‚Äì40%; </li><li>  decrease in the number of diseased tubers and fruits by 70‚Äì100%; </li><li>  rapid germination and an increase in the mass of tubers and fruits of agricultural crops by 20%; </li><li>  an increase in the content in the crop structure of food (by 80‚Äì95%) and seed (by 60‚Äì80%) tubers; </li><li>  increase in starch content in tubers (by 20%) and the amount of sugars in fruits (by 10%). </li></ul><br>  <a href="http://www.findpatent.ru/patent/257/2570624.html">The patent for the strain is</a> already registered.  Now the team is working on obtaining a patent for the drug.  After that, the stage of commercialization will begin: a pilot production batch will be received, documentation will be developed and then samples will be tested on the fields of farmer companies in the Astrakhan region.  Developers plan to conduct sales through a network of distributors of biological products and fertilizers. <br><br>  10% of the turnover plan to allocate for research.  The range will be expanded at the expense of other combinations and preparative forms of the developed biological product, as well as the development of biological products based on other strains of the collection. <br><br>  Organic farming, which has become widespread in Europe, is just beginning to develop in Russia.  The penetration of biopesticides in the country is less than 1%, and the total market volume is $ 4 million.  For comparison, according to the Kleffmann ‚Äì Agrostat marketing agency, the volume of agrochemicals market in 2013 in Russia amounted to $ 1.3 billion.  But the market for biopesticides is booming, and over the past 5 years, its volume in physical terms has increased by 2 times. <br><br>  According to studies, in Russia there are 300 thousand farmers and the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãcommercial crop production is 130 million hectares.  In the future, the drug developers want to take a share of 2-3%, and within 5 years to achieve revenue of 1 billion rubles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/392697/">https://habr.com/ru/post/392697/</a></p>
