Nothing like that</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Fasting is not paid for, and therefore I will smack the truth-womb without brakes.  The article turned out to be ambiguous, even in some places referring to "I resent."  Still, the main theme is not resentment at the poor performance of the NTS company, but an overview of the HTC Sensation phone without smoothing the corners. <br>  Who has prepared, but have not yet spent seven hundred American dollars on this pipe - do not rush, first read. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Prehistory </h4><br>  My first android became Desire.  I changed HD2 for it, because I hesitated to butt with WinMo, and it was boring to return to the ranks of the apple fag. <br><br>  Desire at the time of its appearance was good for almost everyone.  Only one thing frankly irritated me in it - the power button protruding from the end of the phone, which is why it constantly turned on in my pocket when changing the position of the body from sitting to standing, or even when moving up the stairs.  With Desire, I passed a year, perverted over it as I could.  And firmware, and batteries, and external gadgets.  So I quite clearly imagine what an android is capable of. <br><br>  In general, when I saw the first announcements of Pyramid, special attention was paid to the telephone performance characteristics.  Its dual-core and large screen with a resolution almost like that of the 4th apple, but on a larger diagonal, attracted me and I decided to upgrade to it at the first opportunity.

      The opportunity was realized through ebay at the beginning of June, and after almost two weeks of EMS butt, the phone was finally in my hands.  I decided not to hurry and devote at least a day to study what HTC did with its Sense.  ‚ÄúSuddenly you will like it and leave it?‚Äù Thoughtfully crawling on the interface for quite a long time, ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù it. <br><br><h4>  Nishtyak </h4><br>  I can honestly say - Sense 3.0 is the best shell in terms of visualization.  A lot of y-ty-tyulechek that will equally please both geeks and ordinary users.  Very pleased with the task manager "out of the box", which is conveniently located in the upper pull-out menu. <br><br>  New Lockscreen - just a godsend.  It is very convenient to run the application directly from it.  I have four options available that run from Lock Screen was enough. <br><br>  Already ‚Äúnative‚Äù widgets like Friends Stream have become much more convenient in the details.  TweetDeck is still far, but better than it was. <br><br>  The Mail app is probably the best email client for a phone I have seen.  Simple, convenient, informative. <br><br>  Locations also pleased, though not in everything.  Very pleased with the speed of finding yourself on the ground.  In a moving car, Locations, launched for the first time, found himself minutes in two with an accuracy of 50m and then another minute was built up to maximum accuracy.  I am not a motorist, but I actively spin the pedals.  The program does not know how to use the ‚Äúbicycle‚Äù mode, but it refused to start the hiking route from Novogireevo to Schelkovskaya because it is far (!).  I do not know what distance they are walking on in Taiwan, maybe 12 kilometers there - this is a serious trip for a week, but I easily just walk further.  For this reason I could not assess the quality of the built-in card.  On the main roads leads confidently, warns about turns, shifts the route quickly. <br><br>  The camera is like a piece of iron - complete and irreversible sucks.  Read more about cons in the sump.  But the negative impressions in the essential part are being leveled by a really very convenient application for working with cameras.  There are quite a few customizable effects, which gives quite a lot of space in trying to pretend to be a foil or even a cool old film camera. <br><br>  The screen does not seem huge after Desire, but is impressive in the amount of information that fits on it.  In landscape mode, the sites almost do not have to squeeze or stretch, and so everything is clearly visible.  Now browse any news site on the way to work has become much more pleasant.  And how much easier it has become to work on the big screen in ConnectBot - I can‚Äôt even tell you. <br><br>  Very pleased with the large amount of memory built into the phone.  Still, after hemorrhoids with A2SD and moving applications back and forth, fighting for every megabyte, getting a gig is cool.  After linking the phone to my account I was distracted for 10 minutes, and when turned on, I found that all my software was already on the phone and nothing needed to be transferred. <br><br><h4>  Sump </h4><br>  First, Sense with all its wealth.  I said this, I say, and I will say - HTC, pry out the legs and arms of your programmers and change their places.  I don‚Äôt want the Stocks application to hang in my phone‚Äôs memory and consume my battery and my traffic.  It would be necessary to treat the traffic of users more carefully.  In Russia, only in non-rubber there is a mobile anlim for more or less reasonable money.  And in the USA, by the way, there are also tariffs with a limit of 200MB, while Sense eats by itself 4MB per day for all kinds of weather, location service and godless Stocks (is that what he is pumping out there?). <br><br>  A battery is just a paragraph.  HTC, my dear guys, the 1550mAh is the same battery as in Phillips Xenium x713.  But he lives on it a month.  Read lips: me c i.  Sensation for 5 hours while I slept, devoured 8% of the battery just lying on the table in the ‚Äú4 stick‚Äù zone.  WiFi was turned off, cellular data was turned off, all applications were killed before starting the test.  Playing on the phone in the subway while you are going to work is a sure way to provoke the generation of a pack of bloody diarrhea rays towards HTC when it detects a battery that has sat down in 40 minutes.  I played the same games on Desire for the same amount of time and more than 10% of the charge did not go away during that time.  Last night I saw that 29% of the battery remained.  Enabled video to record.  I managed to shoot 13 minutes exactly before the phone turns off automatically.  Those.  The phone can take a maximum of 40 minutes of video, after which it can either be inserted into the cradle or a new battery inserted.  What is the matter, gentlemen developed?  And don't tell me about the gluttonous screen.  Advertised it as mega-economical. <br><br>  The camera, I repeat - rubbish.  The fourth apple, which is already a year old, gives the best quality shots.  And it doesn't matter to me whether he does it with iron or post-processing.  Hellish overshoot on photos and the world's poorest algorithm for dealing with noise is what you get on photos from this tube.  To this, it is also worth adding an incredibly inhibitory focus tracking algorithm.  Shooting something that is not moving in the transverse plane is very difficult - the focus floats away.  Let me remind you that the phone has two cameras, 8 megapixels on the back and 0.3 megapixels on the front side.  So, the front one is not worth mentioning at all - anyway, neither Skype nor Google shows a movie (at least to me). <br><br>  The phone is warming.  About and without.  Like the damned 270th atom.  I honestly expected that the dual core would allow the phone to work under load in literally microseconds, so that it would not get warm quickly either.  But no.  Worn in the front pocket of your pants in the summer is a bad idea; you can get boiled eggs in a bag.  Watch yutub, play 3D games, shoot on camera - all this warms up the phone.  According to the battery monitor, the temperature can reach 51 degrees.  This is me in Tower Raiders 2 played for half an hour.  In the palm of your hand to keep such a hot machine is very uncomfortable.  At least in the summer.  But in the winter, I feel, you can heat their pockets and not only. <br><br>  Applications are not killed by long ‚Äúpressing the button‚Äù Back.  This is a natural setup.  The same Skype can now be closed only using the Stop Skype application. <br><br>  The back cover, in which all antennas are displayed.  Cool, cho.  Goodbye dreams of an extended battery from Mugen Power.  A bag of rock salt under the sheet to the engineer who invented it. <br><br>  Holes all over the back cover.  Holes for the LED backlight, a hole in front of the camera module, a mesh external speaker, and as many as five some strange holes with a diameter of a needle, not counting the microphone from the bottom.  What for?  In the case of the phone all the small rubbish from the pocket gathered.  To wipe the camera, you now need to remove the cover, blow it and the phone, and then crawl a T-shirt right on the inside of the phone.  Or is it a feature like this - a phone-vacuum cleaner? <br><br>  The power button sticks out no worse than Desire.  And, given the increased size of the phone, now it even spontaneously turns on when walking, which I learn from the rise in temperature in my pocket. <br><br>  Loud sound of the appearance of the main screen with the clock and the weather after the lock-screen.  That's what the asshole came up with?  At two o'clock in the morning I turned on the phone, and he began to voice the storm to me at full height!  Yes, so that the designer children were born in triples annually! <br><br>  At the same time, the audibility of the subscriber on a noisy street leaves much to be desired.  It is no worse than that of Desire, but from such a shovel, I expected a higher volume in the ear. <br><br>  S-ON.  It's just a tin what a bummer.  The first thought after realizing that it would not be possible to alter the pipe, until HTC issues an update, was to sell it to hell while it was expensive, and buy some kind of nexus, arc, or something else that is normally sewn.  Because everyone remembers how much time HTC feeds Desire owners ‚Äôbreakfasts from 2.3+. The second thought was‚Äú not for that I butted with EMS to just give up. ‚Äù  However, if there is no unlocking until August, then I will sell it.  Because I do not intend to put up with the battery lawlessness.  The most disgusting thing is that everyone knows that in order to unlock sensation, you just need to organize a ‚Äúleak‚Äù from HTC to xda-developers, and there already those interested will be dragged around the world.  And do not bother with any PTA.  Those who are not interested will be happy with the stock firmware locked.  Learn from Apple.  And to me, if you please, give an open loader. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  I have very dual feelings.  I bought this phone just for the screen.  If Desire had been put inside this case, and they would have given the extra space under the battery, then I would be more happy than now.  A lot of small and not so cons significantly overshadow my life.  On the positive side, I can say that I‚Äôll most likely stop carrying the ypad with me, because now I‚Äôm also very comfortable reading from the phone. <br><br>  In general, all the advantages are somehow connected with a large resolution and screen size, but the minuses are full of kuzovok.  My verdict after a week of use is not to buy, if there is not a very big need for a larger screen than 3.7 ‚Äù480 * 800. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122975/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122975/</a></p>
