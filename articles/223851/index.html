  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why conspiracy theories arise and how to deal with them</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In our Jewish Masonic age of conspiracies and conspiracy theories, it can be difficult for a person to understand what is actually happening around him.  And the matter is not so much in TV, Soviet newspapers and American Internet.  The dog is buried in the natural human being to explain and classify everything - traction, which is just as strong as the desire to eat, or sleep.  To understand what is happening now is to predict what will happen next, which, in turn, will increase the likelihood of survival. <br><br><h4>  Patterns as a basis for self-study </h4><br>  Due to the centuries-old process of evolution, only the most capable of learning remained among us.  Who has not been trained, he died.  Therefore, for all this for a long time, a person has developed his own training system, the basic principle of which is in patterns. <br><br>  The principle of operation of this self-learning system is rather trivial: everything that happens more than 1 time is a candidate for becoming a pattern.  All subsequent patterns, as a rule, are based on the base of existing patterns.  For example, a beginner alpine skier will learn to ski using the information he already has about body coordination in space, which he could get either by learning to ride a bicycle before, or, for example, by learning to skate before.  If there was neither a bicycle, nor skates, and nothing at all, then training will take place on the basis of information obtained from an experienced person about walking in the park, or running around the stadium during physical education lessons.  Obviously, in this case, the training will take place much slower than if the person already had experience in classes as close as possible to downhill skiing.  Of course, there are exceptions when a person, for example, memorized a wrong blow, which he practiced at home for years, and then got to the coach, who clutches his head and says ‚Äúbetter if you came completely without skills (wrong patterns), so that I am from scratch you fashioned a fighter. "  Here it is important to understand that this kind of defective pattern, or anti-pattern, will even interfere with the speedy training of a person.  In this particular case, the model ‚Äúthe more patterns, the better‚Äù - does not work. <br>  But in general, if a person has a bit of consciousness and he follows the diet on the correct patterns, then the number of these patterns in his head will steadily increase the speed of learning new patterns - the person will grasp on the fly. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Redundant patterns </h4><br>  But what if there are no these basic patterns?  Based on what to build your training? <br>  On the one hand, one could just score and teach nothing - leave a blank page in this area.  It would be reasonable, for example, in a situation where a gypsy speaks you a few words in gypsy and you unsuccessfully try to relate them to something that you already know, which leads to the brain freezing, which in such a state is quite hypnotizable.  In the case of a conscious rejection of the "patterning", the person would not fall into the trap with the gypsy.  On the other hand, a person is too afraid not to learn - ‚ÄúWhat if I miss something?‚Äù, ‚ÄúSuddenly this information will be important for me?‚Äù.  He is too afraid not to be able to explain the situation in which he finds himself, because this ultimately is fraught with death.  That is why so many people fall for gypsy hypnosis - the patterning mechanism always works, and it turns on especially sharply when it suddenly turns out that in some field of knowledge a person is a complete zero.  This is one of the reasons why children, who have everything by zero, learn so quickly - they also want to eat patterns, besides sweets for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  And this is one of the reasons for the emergence of the concept of God.  God is first and foremost an attempt by a person to explain what he was unable to explain with the help of patterns that already exist in him.  Can not be explained by science?  Let's write it on the pattern codenamed "God"!  In such cases, programmers typically use the UNKNOWN string.

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      <br>
      Another example of excessive patterning is the situation when a person watches a boring movie, finishes up a boring book, goes on a stupid free newspaper in the subway.  In this case, the person again becomes a victim of his fear of the future and the unconscious desire to learn - ‚ÄúWhat if something important happens at the end of the film?‚Äù, ‚ÄúMorality at the end of the book?‚Äù, ‚ÄúSuddenly, on the last page of the newspaper, I see a message about magnetic storm, or an earthquake? "  Of course, in order to justify his stupidity and time spent, a person then comes up with a thousand apologies in the spirit of "you can learn something new from any book," or there "live and be there, be aware of all the new movies", but this topic for another conversation. <br><br>  Over the course of the life of patterns, a person becomes so numerous that there is no point in continuing self-study.  What for?  He already knows how everything works in this world.  He knows how to tie shoelaces and knows how to caress a kitten.  He knows how to make a resume and how to solve conflict situations - he already has a solid survival kit.  What else is needed? <br><br>  Years will pass, and this person, even despite some intellectual nearness, will gain the fame of a ‚Äúwise man‚Äù - due to his years of service.  A younger person will turn to such a person - not for intellect, but for experience.  Such people, as a rule, know everything about everything, and if they do not know, then they think out a new pattern from the existing patterns and at the same second already ‚Äúknow‚Äù.  That's just the knowledge that is literally sucked from the finger - it accumulates in exactly the same way that profits from non-existing credit money accumulate - a derivative from the air and nothing more.  So, in our country, entire kitchens are teeming with ideal strategists, philosophers, economists from God, competent lawyers, and courageous fighters, who certainly know how to manage the state, rather than "these assholes in power who purposely ruin the country."  Such people are a by-product of their own brains, sharpened by patterning.  What else is interesting is that, apart from the illusions about one's own competence, excessive patterning is fraught with another ailment - the invention of conspiracy theories. <br><br><h4>  Conspiracy theory as an attempt to explain the inexplicable </h4><br>  A conspiracy theory arises when a person is unable to explain something based on the patterns he has ‚Äî for example, like so ‚Äî man descended from a monkey.  In order to fill the gap in his knowledge and not destroy the existing basic patterns, on which there are many other derived patterns, a person comes up with a theory that could explain everything.  For example, the pride and respect of a person for himself and his kind can be based on the pattern ‚Äúman is the son of God‚Äù.  Since this pride could morally help him in bad times, a person does not want to part with this pattern and admit that a person is descended from a monkey.  A person, accordingly, comes up with a new pattern that would not shake an existing design.  As a result, we get - ‚ÄúThe Lord created man in his own image and likeness,‚Äù or ‚Äú... about 10 thousand years ago, there was an alien base on the territory of modern Iraq, which brought people to Earth as an experiment.‚Äù  At the same time, the fact that a person painfully looks like a monkey is of course nothing meaningful coincidence.  In general, Darwin died long ago.  What is more likely?  The fact that man is essentially an animal, or the fact that thousands of years ago on Earth were the mysterious settlements of little men, presumably from the planet Nubira, which were our ancestors?  Most likely, of course, that a man is just a monkey.  But you don‚Äôt want to believe in it and it‚Äôs inconvenient to live with it, especially if you want to consider yourself a cool pepper, a descendant of Gods, a great creation of higher powers.  That is why in recent times there are so many conspiracy theories about the Jewish-Masonic conspiracy, the golden billion, <a href="http://youtu.be/ZN2Ap1UZkKc">reptiloids</a> and newcomers who rule the world and so on. <br><br><h4>  What feed conspiracy theories? </h4><br>  All these conspiracy theories are fed by the sincere desire of a person to explain everything that happens with the help of the magic question ‚ÄúWho benefits from this?‚Äù. <br><br>  This question is often used to get to the bottom of things.  You do not know why certain events take place in the country?  Ask the question - "who benefits?".  Want to know why the war started in Iraq?  Ask who it is profitable.  Do you want to know who is causing the riots in the South-East of Ukraine?  Ask who it is profitable and get an answer.  And this materialistic model seems to be good, and can explain many events taking place.  It is difficult to oppose this approach, because the thirst for gain is de facto recognized by many people as part of the nature of any person. <br><br>  Judging by this logic, someone stands behind every event.  The genius of combinatorics, he calculated the entire batch 100 steps forward, foresaw and weighed all the options, prepared Plan A, Plan B, Plan C and even Plan D. There are no fools!  They know exactly what they want.  These sales reptile zhidomasony. <br><br>  This conspiracy logic produces selected pearls: <br><br>  1. Turchinov and Tymoshenko purposefully destroy Ukraine, because Putin promised them money. <br>  2. Ukraine is ‚Äúdrained‚Äù, as the Crimea merged.  Again, for the money from Putin. <br>  3. Yatsenyuk - agent of the State Department, who organized the revolution for Obama's money.  Because NATO just wants to keep its bases in Ukraine too. <br>  4. The whole world once again conspired against Russia.  These bourgeois dream to destroy the great Russia, and the Russian people to make slaves. <br>  5. Kolomoisky runs tanks and helicopters at his own expense because he wants to squeeze Akhmetov‚Äôs business. <br>  6. The revolution was started by the oligarchs in order to raise all prices and thus cash in on. <br>  7. Tymoshenko was released from prison because Putin was profitable - she would buy gas from him at a high price. <br>  8. On the Maidan fought mainly for Klitschko's money.  In general, these were professional mercenaries from Poland and Montenegro. <br>  9. Yulia imprisoned herself in order to wind the falling rating during his time. <br>  10. Heavenly hundred were shot by Turchinov‚Äôs order, so that the revolution could continue and he could become acting.  the president. <br>  11. In the Odessa House of Trade Unions, Yatsenyuk organized the slaughter in order to rally the nation around the tragedy. <br>  12. Putin planned the ‚Äúbloody Saturday‚Äù on the Maidan on November 30 to squeeze the Crimea and the rest of Ukraine. <br>  13. (and this is my theory) - The Right Sector is a project of the Kremlin, which was created specifically to substantiate the entry of Russian troops. <br><br>  And so on. <br><br>  And even though these pearls give a lot of positive emotions, the unprepared man in the street is powerless against them, as an unarmed person is powerless against scrap - all because of the apparent "validity" that is based on the concepts of profit and materialism.  If we assume that a person does what he does for ideological reasons, then it can be said - ‚Äúhe does this in order to assert himself, to think better of himself, so that, finally, dopamine hormone figs in the brain, like a drug addict and he got a thrill from it. ‚Äù  And in any case, even behind the most ideological person will be necessarily a gray cardinal, a money bag, an invisible figure, in whose hands everyone is dancing like puppets.  He is the one who rules the ball.  Quiet, Pawson and Murka, everything is under control, all the brothers-in-law and godfathers have already penetrated everywhere.  This strong and stable construction, however, has its Achilles heel. <br><br><h4>  Use on health: </h4><br><blockquote>  When a heavy downpour begins, water floods the roads and floods the underground passages, the umbrellas sellers get super profits.  Why did it rain?  So, in order to get to the bottom of the truth, you need to ask the same question - ‚Äúto whom it was profitable?‚Äù.  Aha  - There those sellers with umbrellas fabulously gilded on him.  It's them!  It was they who threw off onto the plane that sprayed aerosol in the sky and caused rain!  And with them in the share probably still sellers of raincoats and rubber boots, but there you are bastards! </blockquote><br><br>  This simple example proved that random processes are possible in the world that were not directed by anyone.  Of course, it is likely that the sellers of umbrellas really threw themselves on an airplane with an aerosol and therefore it started to rain, but the likelihood of such an event is extremely small, and after applying the Occam's Razor principle, this is generally insignificant.  Of course, I understood that there are random processes in the world and in society, but some comrades about the events in Ukraine are tearing the roof off so quickly and quietly that they had to urgently look for similar methods to <a href="http://youtu.be/_dydTviK8gY%3Ft%3D1m2s">set the poor minds away</a> .  With this small example, absolutely all conspiracy theories can be called into question, which, as one, are based on the idea that everything is seized. <br><br>  There is also a more lightweight version: <br><blockquote>  If the sun shines, it means someone needs it. </blockquote><br><br>  And after all, all these speculative theories could be quite successfully dissected with the help of Occam's Razor.  True, then the world would be much simpler and more boring.  A world in which there is no evil fate and failure, there is no genetic heredity and a wide bone, a world in which you yourself are responsible for what happens to you, and, finally, a world in which there is a place for accidents and, most likely, no invisible hands of Big Brother, which stands behind every little event in your life. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/223851/">https://habr.com/ru/post/223851/</a></p>
