  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mouse-baby for work "in the field" - what is it and why is it needed?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Probably, anyone who has a laptop or netbook knows what a touchpad is and knows how to use it.  My netbook also has a touchpad.  For a long time I tried to get used to it, but I did not manage to fully adapt.  The netbook's touchpad is small, the function buttons are also not very large.  Let's just say, constantly using such a touchpad is not very convenient.  Of course, you can use the mouse, and the touchpad - as an addition to it, but this is also not always convenient.  In a cafe, just on trips the mouse is not the most convenient tool.  And I decided to find something more convenient.  In this review, I'm going to talk about a gadget that recently came into my hands, and which I tried to use as an alternative to a conventional touchpad and a regular mouse.  The results of testing, I think, will be of interest to many representatives of the community. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The device that came to me was an optical mouse on the finger MT6022 from the company "Master Kit".  The device is positioned as an alternative to the usual mouse.  In other words, the mouse is designed for situations where the use of a conventional manipulator is inconvenient (no smooth surfaces), for example, in transport, on a park bench, lying on a sofa, and the like.  By the way, the mouse was mentioned on Habr√© <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/24034/">here</a> , but no one has yet tested this device, so I will be the first in this sense. <br><br>  I‚Äôll say right away that the mouse is a wired one, and despite the fact that the USB cord is quite durable, I consider the manipulator‚Äôs ‚Äúconductivity‚Äù a disadvantage, although not very significant.  Why?  Well, for example, if you need to move away from the netbook or notubuk further than a meter, you will have to remove the gadget from your finger.  True, it's pretty simple.  In this case, a velcro mount was invented, which makes it possible to easily remove and put the device on your finger.  The mouse can be mounted both on the index and on the ring finger of the right hand. <br><br>  As for the touchpad, it has an advantage in this case.  After all, such a tool does not have any wires, and the touchpad will not mind if you go somewhere, without restricting your movement in space.

      On the other hand, bearing in mind the small size of the ‚Äúon-foot‚Äù mouse, it is difficult to imagine where the wireless module and battery can be placed.  Now the mouse, though light, but her weight on the finger felt.  But, in principle, it would be nice if there was a wireless model. <br><br>  The resolution of the on-mouse mouse, indicated in the specifications, is 1200dpi, this is not so much, but it is enough for ordinary needs.  To draw with such a resolution beautifully, of course, will not succeed.  But using the touchpad is even harder to draw.  On the other hand, how often do we draw something?  Well, of course, if you are a graphic designer, then yes, you have to draw often.  But, probably, you have more advanced tools, in terms of drawing. <br><br>  I have some difficulty when you need to select and click on a small interface element, but I think this requires skill.  Then the touchpad comes forward - because with his help, making a click on small elements is not difficult. <br><br>  Separately, I note that on the mouse except for the left and right buttons there is a wheel, this facilitates scrolling compared to the touchpad.  In addition, while the mouse is running, the touchpad is not blocked, so that both devices can be used simultaneously. <br><br>  In general, the functionality of a mini-mouse is similar to the functionality of a conventional manipulator.  You just need to get used to the portability and some features of the mini-rodent.  Yes, it is unusual, but on the road or all sorts of sofa poses a clear plus compared with the touchpad. <br><br>  I note that, like all modern mice, this one in the absence of movement switches to economy mode, muffling the brightness of the LED.  Therefore, you will not blind others, waving his arms.  Airplanes also do not try to shoot down, it will not work.  And the police does not sleep. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b68/dec/abe/b68decabe19c95082d71835713effa8e.jpg"><br>  During the test, I noticed what was indicated in the device description.  Namely, the fact that the ability of a portable manipulator to work in conditions that can be problematic for an ordinary mouse is a big plus of the device.  The baby mouse works fine on soft surfaces (sofas, bed, knee), it should be noted that it does it even better than on smooth horizontal surfaces.  Actually, there is nothing to be surprised at, this mouse-baby is designed. <br><br>  As my personal practice has shown, such a mouse is most convenient when you are lying and the netbook warms your stomach.  But this is for me, and I do not travel so often.  In addition, it is quite convenient to work with the mouse when you are sitting in a chair, but not as usual, but across.  Many netbook models have touchpad buttons on the front edge, and they rest against the stomach, if you sit in this way.  Working with the touchpad becomes almost impossible.  Here in this case, the mouse, which is referred to in the reviewer, really helps out.  But, admit, many people like to sit in a chair, not like everyone else :) <br><br>  I tried the mouse in the "field" conditions, taking a netbook and this device to the university, where there are not many opportunities to use a stationary mouse.  The ‚Äúmini-rodent‚Äù showed itself well, and besides, it attracted additional attention from a pair of my classmates, who urgently wanted to try the device on their own finger.  Increased attention of others in some cases can also be credited to the advantages of the mouse.  Well, seriously, I rescued the mouse in a cafe, where they don‚Äôt have much space either, and in the park (the mouse was tested a little earlier, when it was still possible to walk or sit on a bench in the park, not feeling all the benefits of late autumn in the form of wet snow and other favors of nature), where I took a netbook to listen to music, but could not resist and decided to drop by a couple of familiar sites (yes, one of these sites was Habr). <br><br>  Of course, I could not resist, so as not to disassemble the "rodent".  Electronics to a minimum.  Everything is kept on a single chip, in which the photodetector is already embedded.  Minimalism in electronics is good.  The simpler the filling, the better. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/49a/b26/1a6/49ab261a65d4bb4d9f41a9e4d34acbfd.jpg"><br><br>  Well, it's time to take stock: <br><ul><li>  Minus: requires addiction.  Even with the right grip is controlled more difficult than a regular mouse.  As an alternative to a conventional mouse ... maybe, but definitely not in my case. </li><li>  Minus and plus: wire.  Wire - minus.  But since the wire, it is necessary to praise the wire - the wire is covered in dense matter that protects it further. </li><li>  Plus: good for use on the road, in non-working positions, in places where there is not much space.  Portable.  The scroll wheel gives megabonus compared to the touchpad when reading long pages. </li></ul><br>  Other devices from Master Kit can be found <a href="http://dadget.ru/katalog/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr.ru%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_term%3Dmouse%26utm_content%3Dmouse%26utm_campaign%3Dmouse">here</a> .
