A quarter of a million people died, all but 20,000 of whom were civilians.  However, it is already known that the bombs dropped on the Japanese were not very powerful.  In addition, they exploded before reaching the ground.

      The first Soviet atomic bomb, tested on August 29, 1949 at the Semipalatinsk test site, was copied from the American sample. <br><br>  Great Britain followed the lead of the USSR and, on October 3, 1952, in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Monte-Bello Islands (north-west of Australia) made the first test of surface nuclear weapons.  The result was an explosion of about 25 kilotons.  In 1960, France chose the Algerian desert to blow up a device three times the power of a bomb dropped on Nagasaki. <br><br>  The Tsar Bomb, developed in the USSR, is considered the most powerful tested nuclear weapon.  The total explosion energy, according to various sources, ranged from 57 to 58.6 megatons in TNT equivalent.  Tests of the bomb took place on October 30, 1961.  Result: the fireball of the explosion reached a radius of approximately 4.6 kilometers, the mushroom cloud rose to a height of 67 kilometers, and the diameter of its two-tiered hat reached (at the upper tier) 95 kilometers.  The bomb was 1500 more powerful than those dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. <br><br>  The largest nuclear weapon, Castle Bravo, was tested on March 1, 1954 on the Bikini Atoll (Republic of the Marshall Islands, associated with the United States).  In addition, this weapon is the most powerful of all US nuclear tests.  The explosion was three times stronger than scientists predicted.  The cloud that formed after the explosion of ‚ÄúCastle Bravo‚Äù was attributed to habitable atolls, which caused radiation sickness and birth defects.  According to the data of the Japanese Ministry of Health, as a result of the test of ‚ÄúCastle Bravo‚Äù, 856 Japanese fishing vessels with a total crew size of about 20 thousand people were infected. <br><br>  Over the next decades, China, India and Pakistan have successfully tested nuclear devices.  There is an opinion that Israel and South Africa may have experienced nuclear weapons in secret.  The DPRK ratified the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 2003, but later withdrew its signature and, in 2006, may have tested a small nuclear device. <br><br>  The map also contains pictograms of non-military explosions of nuclear devices, primarily by the USSR.  These include excavation of artificial harbors, geological exploration of gas and oil fields, as well as tests aimed at stimulating fields and facilitating the production of natural gas. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/391593/">https://habr.com/ru/post/391593/</a></p>
