Exhibitions, premieres, and the like are held regularly, but this is all a formal setting, and there‚Äôs no communication between the players.  But to collect gamers for a few days inside a simple recreation center, where the main entertainment is not technology, but sports - is it possible? <br><br>  From <b>August 6 to August 8, the</b> festival <b>GAMER LIVE 2010 was</b> held at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ll%3D56.390344,36.891725%26spn%3D0.009217,0.020063%26t%3Dh%26z%3D16"><b>Vympel</b></a> recreation center near Moscow, and the answer is yes!  On Habr√© has already been published the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/games/99228/">announcement of</a> this event, dedicated to the birthday of <a href="http://gamer.ru/">GAMER.ru</a> , and now - a story about how it happened, and photos.  And yes, the girls were there too, moreover, of their own free will! <br><br>  The opening ceremony of the festival took place on the evening of Friday, <b>August 6th</b> .  In Moscow, participants were given packages with gifts from the organizers, as well as a badge with a name and nickname.  From the sweltering and veiled smog of Moscow, we set off on a comfortable bus to the music, of course, from the games.

      <i>[There are many photos under the cut]</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="http://www.gamer.ru/system/attached_images/images/000/233/629/original/IMG_4431_50_.JPG" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://www.gamer.ru/system/attached_images/images/000/233/633/original/IMG_4508_50_.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  The main goal of the first day is to get comfortable in a new place and to get acquainted with the clan members, shoulder to shoulder with whom you have to fight for victory in the next 48 hours.  Despite the general friendly attitude, <b>GAMER LIVE</b> is also a team competition, and the first task for the clans was to come up with a name and show off effectively at the evening performance.  Upon arrival at the place, everyone ran up to the gazebos, and for about an hour there was a creative process: <br><br><img src="http://www.gamer.ru/system/attached_images/images/000/233/642/original/IMG_4635_50_.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  And finally, the representation of the clans on the stage of the local <b>DK</b> : <br><br><img src="http://img7.imageshack.us/img7/694/img4425ni.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://img812.imageshack.us/img812/2039/img4434.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The rest of the evening was spent in dating, conversations and board games. <br><br><img src="http://img34.imageshack.us/img34/8300/img4439c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/54c/591/59c/54c59159c187f1a0dd5133d34c100eeb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The second day was devoted to rest from computers and a sedentary lifestyle.  After morning exercise in the open air, it was time for the Fogeym quest in the best traditions of the <b>MMORPG</b> .  The entire territory of the base was involved, where the teams searched for the right people and took the next task from them.  In the best traditions - because instead of grind mobs, players solved intellectual puzzles, put down puzzles for speed, and at the same time demonstrated strength, agility and endurance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3c5/b00/fd8/3c5b00fd834d7cb99460f27d0ede4c80.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://www.gamer.ru/system/attached_images/images/000/233/649/original/IMG_4939_50_.JPG?1282210511" alt="image"><br><br>  Assignment texts are worthy of special mention: <br><br><img src="http://www.gamer.ru/system/attached_images/images/000/233/646/original/IMG_4819_50_.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  Enough running up, we went to the pool.  The pool was surprisingly cool for the forests of the Moscow region: large, deep, with a five-meter tower.  But the main thing - with cool water in the forty-degree heat! <br><br><img src="http://img18.imageshack.us/img18/9968/img4664c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://www.gamer.ru/system/attached_images/images/000/227/241/original/IMG_4739.jpg?1281349023" alt="image"><br><br>  After lunch there was a paintball tournament from the company <a href="http://warside.ru/">Kraken Games</a> .  Although many of them took real rifles for the first time, the action turned out to be very interesting and entertaining - at short distances and among the trees tactics were more important than firing accuracy, and with this gamers have no problems <br><br><img src="http://img185.imageshack.us/img185/4342/img4765.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://www.gamer.ru/system/attached_images/images/000/228/751/original/IMG_2600.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  Then there was a rest in the form of a presentation of new <b>NVIDIA</b> products: <b>GTX 460</b> video cards and 3D Vision Surround.  Anyone could appreciate the <b>3D-</b> picture at once on three monitors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1c3/cbc/568/1c3cbc568f5233fd19c083896b8fe8c9.jpg" alt="image"><br>  After the presentation, there was a story by <b>Daniel ‚ÄúGraver‚Äù Katsnelson</b> about the life of cybersportsmen and his career in <b>Counter-Strike</b> . <br><br><img src="http://img836.imageshack.us/img836/3627/26782219.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And at the end of the day - an outdoor show program: contests for gaming erudition and acting, a mini-tournament on <b>DJ Hero</b> and many, many prizes.  For example, players had to recall quotes from WarCraft and StarCraft, depict dead terrorists and drag the Ring of the One Power into the fire, without departing from the scene. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/25a/ff9/081/25aff908100627ca9278cc66e8242c5f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/009/07e/aac/00907eaac4491d1e3ab9401ecbe94121.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://img828.imageshack.us/img828/6319/92223493.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the third day of the morning, a game zone was opened, where there was a complete set of <b>Guitar Hero</b> with two guitars, a drum set and a microphone.  And of course, immediately there were many groups willing to try out a strange thing.  Later, a tournament was held between the clans for the title of the best rock group, where not only the accuracy of hitting the notes, but also the entertainment performance as a whole was evaluated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c43/256/f32/c43256f326f4db05c96a6d05d13bf14d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d42/624/255/d42624255d24788f1ba8fb7d16475d53.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After lunch, it was time for the main event of the third day - the tournament on the legendary <b>StarCraft</b> (first part).  Not everyone wanted to be distracted from <b>Guitar Hero</b> , so the games were held in parallel.  Participants fought on gaming <b>PCs</b> <a href="http://www.it-menu.ru/catalog/40044496.htm">USN Level 516 WCG</a> , which became the official gaming platform of the tenth <a href="http://www.wcg.ru/">World Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãGames</a> championship.  The tournament was held with the support of the online store of computer delicacies <a href="http://www.it-menu.ru/">IT menu</a> and became the final part of the main quest of the summer. <br><br><img src="http://www.gamer.ru/system/attached_images/images/000/233/676/original/IMG_5517_50_.JPG" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/285/9bd/52c/2859bd52ccb458e61f13106f0045c027.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the ceremony of summing up, the winners of <b>GAMER LIVE 2010 were</b> determined: the brave clan <b>"The Witchers"</b> came out on top, followed by the <b>"Good Trolls"</b> , and the third place was shared by the <b>Kompot</b> and <b>Clear Sky</b> clans. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8a4/a28/993/8a4a2899389acb4cafd3aafdf6bba230.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>[A lot of photos can be found <a href="http://www.gamer.ru/games/3596-gamer-live">in the festival blog</a> ]</i> <br><br>  Finally, I would like to bring the conversation with the barmaid of the recreation center: <br><br>  <i>- Who are you guys?</i>  <i>A lot of you ...</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- We are gamers, uh ... we are the ones who play computer games</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Is it necessary to constantly kill there?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Sometimes you have to, yes</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Oh, and I read, those who play - they are crazy, cut off from life, afraid to go out into the street, cut each other ...</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Well, look at us, are we like that?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- I would not say ... Normal guys, funny!</i>  <i>Gamers, speak?</i> <br><br>  So, the first festival <b>GAMER LIVE</b> performs its main task perfectly: it destroys stereotypes.  Gamers, in fact, also people =) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f33/e55/cb0/f33e55cb0164052a620c5b4a8d04e2cf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>The social network <a href="http://gamer.ru/">GAMER.ru</a> is especially grateful to the general partner of the festival - Fogeym entertainment portal, companies <a href="http://warside.ru/">Kraken Games</a> , <a href="http://nvidia.ru/">NVIDIA</a> , <a href="http://snowball.ru/">Snowball Studios</a> , 1C-Softklab, Playstation, Electronic Arts, information partners - First television channel and <a href="http://goodgame.ru/">Goodgame</a> portal <a href="http://goodgame.ru/">. ru</a> for the help in organizing and holding the event.</i> <br><br>  <b>See you at GAMER LIVE 2011!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/102215/">https://habr.com/ru/post/102215/</a></p>
