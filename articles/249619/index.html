Since then, we have analyzed every comment, request from the support service and have worked tirelessly on improving our tool for visually commenting sites and images.  Today I would like to present you a small report on our development over the past year: <br><br><h4>  <b>Integration</b> </h4><br>  Our team initially relied on integration, since most companies already have a certain process and we understood that it is unlikely that anyone would use our system as the main bug tracker.  Therefore, the main focus was on developing a tool that could be easily incorporated into any existing process. <a name="habracut"></a>  Over the past year, we have added about 20 integrations with various systems so that any team can quickly integrate our tool into their workflow.  We mainly support interaction with task management systems. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/475/cfb/71d/475cfb71d5574368a1ecbf4f100c6561.png" alt="image"></div><br><br><h5>  <b>Supported project management systems:</b> </h5><br><ol><li>  <a href="https://trackduck.com/en/content/integrations/Basecamp/">Basecamp</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://trackduck.com/en/content/integrations/Jira/">Atlassian jira</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://trackduck.com/en/content/integrations/pivotaltracker/">Pivotal tracker</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://trackduck.com/en/content/integrations/trello/">Trello</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://trackduck.com/en/content/integrations/redmine/">Redmine</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://trackduck.com/en/content/integrations/asana/">Asana</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://trackduck.com/en/content/integrations/github/">Github</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://trackduck.com/en/content/integrations/gemini/">Gemini</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://trackduck.com/en/content/integrations/Teamwork/">Teamwork</a> </li></ol><br><h5>  <b>Chatami</b> </h5><br><ol><li>  <a href="https://trackduck.com/en/content/integrations/slack/">Slack</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://trackduck.com/en/content/integrations/flowdock/">Flowdock</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://trackduck.com/en/content/integrations/hipchat/">HipChat</a> </li></ol><br><h5>  <b>CMS</b> </h5><br><ol><li>  <a href="https://trackduck.com/en/content/integrations/wordpress/">Wordpress</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://trackduck.com/en/content/integrations/modx/">Modx</a> </li></ol><br><h5>  <b>And also with other systems</b> </h5><br><ol><li>  <a href="https://trackduck.com/en/content/integrations/intercom/">Intercom</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://starthq.com/apps/trackduck">Starthq</a> </li></ol><br>  If you did not find your system in the list, you can use the <a href="https://trackduck.com/en/content/integrations/Zapier/">integration through Zapier</a> .

    <h4>  <b>Java script API</b> </h4><br>  Using our js api you can use the TrackDuck widget in the interface of your system.  This will allow you to add the ability to visually comment on any content on your system or, for example, you can get screenshots of any place on your pages without using our control panel.  Based on this functionality, we have developed a plugin for the Intercom widget, which allows you to add screenshots of the page to messages to the support service.  The plugin has already proven itself in our system and on several connected projects.  At the moment we include it only on request. <br><br><h4>  <b>Rejection of the free version and special rate for freelancers</b> </h4><br>  With the release of the project from the beta version, we made a difficult decision to completely disable free accounts in our system, since unfortunately user support took quite a lot of time and part of the resources of our small team had to deal with it.  We decided to focus on commercial users, as this was more in line with our service development strategy.  Also, corporate users have the opportunity to personalize our control panel and widgets, to buy plans without restrictions on the number of projects. <br><br><h4>  <b>Revised commenting widget</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2e1/70e/821/2e170e82161b4082bc5917b408061766.gif" alt="image" width="330" align="right"><br>  In total, since the launch, we have reworked and redesigned our widget 8 times, working on usability and speed of work is still ongoing, here are some significant improvements that you can take advantage of today: <br>  adding files and images to a comment: you can add files to your comments. <br>  adding screenshots to a post or comment.  Now the user has the ability to add a screenshot of a part of the page or image to his commentary, which facilitates the discussion of visual elements in different parts of the page. <br><br><h4>  <b>Improved work with images and designs</b> </h4><br>  Now in 1 click you can change the order of images in any TrackDuck project, you can also set any name for your image.  For each loaded image or design it is now possible to set a number of parameters, such as background color, image positioning on the screen (center, left, etc.), also you can use the special Smart-crop mode, which allows you to do ‚Äú Endless ‚Äùbackground for your design from the leftmost pixel of your image.  In addition, the designers who work with TrackDuck now have a presentation mode available - just upload your images (we support multi-loading), sort in the necessary order, open the first one and you can show one by one, controlling the demonstration from the keyboard. <br><br><h4>  <b>Weekly design inspiration</b> </h4><br>  We try to support talented, but as yet not very well-known designers, every week on Wednesdays we release a selection of designers from around the world on a specific topic, for example, one of our latest releases was devoted to designers who make <a href="http://blog.trackduck.com/weekly/15-designers-damn-good-making-infographics/">wonderful infographics</a> . <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fd4/e18/705/fd4e18705729446e8ab187d6edb4c357.jpg"></div><br><br><h4>  <b>Subscribe to <a href="http://blog.trackduck.com/">our blog</a> :</b> </h4><br>  Very soon our blog will be a year old, during this time we have released a large number of interesting articles, interviews with industry professionals, talked about how to develop our product.  I present to your attention a selection of 3 of the most interesting articles in my opinion, unfortunately so far only in English: <br><ol><li>  <a href="http://blog.trackduck.com/2014/12/08/colour-theory-the-basics-useful-tools-and-further-resources/">Color Theory: The Basics, Useful Tools and Further Resources</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://blog.trackduck.com/2015/01/27/6-things-digital-agencies-get-wrong-testing/">6 Web Design Trends for 2015</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://blog.trackduck.com/2014/11/26/improve-onboarding-process-trello/">How to Improve Your Onboarding Process With Trello</a> </li></ol><br><br><h4>  <b>Thank you for this wonderful year!</b> </h4><br>  We would like to thank all our users, the number of whom has long overstepped for 10,000 for their support, advice, feedback.
