That is, the network is the same.  But billing is now my biline.  And the servers obviously too. <br><br>  In the next sentence, I will express my opinion about the people who prepared and organized this transition.  You are pus on the body of Moscow providers, you are absolutely brainless ciliates who have no place in such a business, I would not trust you to operate a tent on the mitino radio market.  I hate you.  With all my soul. <br><br>  Those who are interested in how it looked - I ask for cat.  Muscovites, too, everything is bad with the Internet. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I‚Äôll say at once why I used the Corbina.  This is the most stable provider in my neighborhood, the speed is stable -18 \ 18 mbps (at a rate), the money was written off evenly, several times a day, the type of Internet connection is l2tp, the load on the router is minimal, quite small ping ... space.  I was not sorry obviously overpay (compared with other providers in the area).  Naturally, against this background, it would not be a sin to set up a small server at home and slowly host sites of friends and ejabberd.

      It all started this morning.  Having come to work, I could not log into the jabber through my server.  Pinged home router - the answer was approximately as follows: <br>  Destination Host Unreachable <br>  From m9-bb-teng3-1.msk.corbina.net (195.14.32.29) icmp_seq = 2103 <br>  Since this is not my server, I wrote to the technical support of Corbina and went to go about my business with a satisfied look. <br><br>  At home I was already in the evening - well, let's say, around 21.00.  When I saw the silent router again, I transferred a small amount to my account with Korbin (by the way, thanks to QIWI - now your LC works fine from the phone).  Well, yes, I am inattentive - I could have seized the moment of shutdown.  This effect is not given any.  However, I did not see my money anymore. <br><br>  I did not call, I wrote from the mobile phone again to the caliper.  And then I realized that the support for the Corbin no longer exists - I did not receive a report about the created ticket.  And there was no letter of the previous ticket either. <br><br>  We switch the router to DHCP mode, stomp on stat.corbina.net and see the following there: <i>From December 1, 2009 a new Personal Account is available to you ...</i> and a link to the new account.  What do you think?  Right!  It is not accessible from the internal network.  Totally. <br><br>  We crawl to the specified address from the phone and get into the personal account of the biline.  Beautifully made (by the standards of the year of the commercial year 2002), it is absolutely non-functional and happily informs us that ‚ÄúThere is no money on the account.‚Äù With a bill of 300 rubles, yes.  Well, okay. &lt;Sarcasm&gt; Let's say that from December 17 (it was on that day that an advertisement about canceling the daily payment was posted) I entered this new personal account and even rewound me that I would end on the 21st, due to the mythical reason to a positive balance &lt;/ sarcasm&gt; <br><br>  We see the button "trust payment".  Wow.  At least something good.  We press on it (I remind you - when the Corbin network is working, I have to move from the phone through the billing room) and we get figs with oil.  Service unavailable.  This is not entirely logical in this situation.  Probably I have transferred too little money to the bank? <br><br>  Then I was going to go and pay for the Internet.  As in the distant 2004m - for the whole month at once.  Saved by the fact that stopping to smoke in front of the store, I noticed the following advertisement, dated today: <br>  <i>We would like to inform you that at the moment it is temporarily impossible to accept payments on the ‚Äúold‚Äù 13-digit number of the Personal Account (Corbina).</i>  <i>We ask to pay by a new 10-digit number (Beeline).</i> <br><br>  Cool  And I pay through my personal account and for me there is only a button ‚Äúpay for the Internet‚Äù.  Without any numbers.  Well, warned at least in time and thanks for that.  22nd.  On that day, when an ordinary home user could no longer get into this personal account. <br><br>  In the personal account of QIWI, I never found the beeline internet.  Only beeline TV.  I did not risk it, I paid through a button on the terminal itself - minus 50 rubles by a commission.  Out of the store, updated the page lk.beeline.ru ... Well, in general, the money did not come more slowly.  It's good.  Only in the jabber from the phone I still can‚Äôt log in (the router is always-on).  We come home, push buttons-links ... <s>And in general we come to the conclusion that the server l2tp.corbina.net no longer exists.</s> <br><br>  <s>We change the type of connection to PPTP</s> , with sadness, we look at the download of the router that jumped 5 times, we run speedtest to a personal server with guaranteed 100 \ 100 Mbps.  My speed is now 16.5 megabits DL and 6 mbps UL.  Well approximately.  But in any case, talk about the symmetry of the channel is not necessary.  She is not in sight. <br><br>  About a few reconnects for the last hour I will not even speak.  About the fact that Corbin owed me repairs, but in the biline they appear as closed, I will not say anything either.  About the fact that the problems with access to Europe have not been resolved - everything is already up to date. <br><br>  And another very interesting thing: <br>  <i>The end date of the billing period 2010-01-21 21:46:21</i> <br>  Although the services were paid today at ~ 22.00.  Excellent practice of many telecoms - pay for the Internet at the end of the month, use one day and pay again? <br><br>  Let's sum up.  What is Beeline Internet after Corbina: <br><ul><li>  Non-working without internet lk </li><li>  Decreased by one and a half megabits DL and 2-3 times UL </li><li>  inadequate caliper </li><li>  the changed billing system, which led to the fact that many customers today or tomorrow, and maybe longer, will remain without the Internet </li><li>  the inability to change the tariff until you pay for your beautiful high-speed Internet and do not use the month for that hunchbacked Zaporozhets from a print ad </li><li>  Error 502 Bad Gateway in the LC provider </li><li>  incomprehensible status of this provider in QIWI LC </li><li>  idle trust payment that we all really needed today </li><li>  daily billing promise in the first quarter of 2010go year.  We are waiting for him in 2011 </li><li>  completely brainless and untimely system of delivering news to customers.  By the way - 90% of clients never read these announcements. </li><li>  inconvenient payment time </li></ul><br><br>  Thanks for having guessed not changing my static ip. <br><br>  <s>PS: the L2TP server is still being searched in the biline.</s> <br>  PPS: Corbin.  The one that is real.  You really were a good provider. <br><br>  UPD: L2TP server found.  UL truth has not changed.  (85.21.0.251 for my segment). <br>  UPD2: Problems began to be solved.  The <a href="http://inkvizitor68sl.habrahabr.ru/blog/79025/">comments</a> indicated where to go for the most urgent. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79025/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79025/</a></p>
