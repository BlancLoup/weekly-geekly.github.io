Then he called on the progressive public to build a <a href="http://hectop.livejournal.com/tag/%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2584%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0">distributed Bolcosphere 2.0</a> . <br><br>  Such a formulation of the question seems to me the most correct and here are my 5 cents in the collection of ideas.

      Distributed blogosphere should be divided into strictly delineated entities. <br><ul><li>  User ID </li><li>  User Content </li><li>  Container (or server). </li><li>  Search server. </li></ul><br>  Consider them in more detail: <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  User ID (UID). </h4><br>  The simplest and most crucial component.  According to the form, the UID is a url.  In terms of content, the UID should include a set of standard blogosphere interfaces: <br><ul><li>  Open user ID.  (so that it can always be authorized). </li><li>  RSS feed blog. </li><li>  what else standard interfaces. </li></ul><br>  It is very important that the user has the opportunity at any time to change the DNS settings for his UID and redirect him to the new server.  The most correct guarantee that the url (that is, the UID) will always remain with the owner is to have it in the form of a pure domain (without additional directories), which is registered to the owner of the UID.  Although it does not have to be something pretentious type tema.ru.  Geographical third level domains are in bulk and free. <br><br><h4>  User content </h4><br><br>  This is what now makes of an empty LJ account - the thousandth.  Namely: <br><ul><li>  Structured information from the profile.  Name, nickname, email, ICQ, birthday, etc. </li><li>  Avatar (s) </li><li>  A set of static pages. </li><li>  Blog feed </li><li>  Comments to blog entries, pages, photos, etc. </li><li>  Media storage  Photos, podcasts, videos, etc. </li><li>  Friends lists and security settings.  Who sees what / who can. </li><li>  Design pages (in the form of CSS probably). </li></ul><br>  The content format of the user must be standardized.  Those.  for example, the directory structure should be defined where XML and media files are laid out in a strict order and which can be packed into a neat zip file. <br><br><h4>  Container (or server). </h4><br><br>  Hardware, infrastructure and software that can host the contents of one or many users.  It should look like this: <br><ul><li>  register on the server. </li><li>  redirect your uid to the DNS server. </li><li>  we load on the server a backup of your content (the format, as we remember, is standardized). </li><li>  We get our cozy ZHrshechka at the usual address. </li></ul><br>  I felt sad, offended: <br><ul><li>  pick up the backup content.  (which of course we did regularly) </li><li>  registering your own hosting </li><li>  we deploy standard (and open) server software. </li><li>  redirect to your hosting DNS your UID. </li><li>  we load to ourselves a backup of the content. </li><li>  We get back our cozy ZhZhishechka at the usual address. </li></ul><br><br>  Who will keep the content server?  I see at least three obvious scenarios: <br><ul><li>  a small server on your own hosting for your loved one (and maybe for a few more friends). </li><li>  service for a monthly fee.  Gentlemen pay 5 tanks per month and they are not interested in issues of availability, connectivity, business continuity and emergency recovery. </li><li>  service for advertising.  Boys allocate space for banners and text ad units and do not soar with payment. </li></ul><br><h4>  Search server. </h4><br><br>  This is a server that knows the profiles of a large number of users (all?) And can answer questions like: <br><ul><li>  find me Vasya Pupkin, who studied at school 13 in the town of Muhosransk, graduated in '67. </li><li>  find all users with the interest of ‚Äúdried chamomile‚Äù. </li><li>  find all girls aged 14 to 20 years from the city of Upper Podgorsk who have been online in the last 7 days. </li></ul><br>  The search server plays the role of an aggregator and some common denominator for the blogosphere.  We go there to see and show others.  Notice the huge role that people search for current social network operators.  It is this functionality that binds users to the service and ‚Äúcements‚Äù the audience.  Separating the search from the servers and content, we make it a nice and innocuous assistant.  After all, there can be several independent search servers. <br><br>  Technically, server software can be quite simple.  Monetization is obvious.  Over time, the search function will gladly pick up large search companies. <br><br>  Thus we have a distributed network of content servers.  The part works on a commercial basis, part amateur.  We also have the blogosphere population.  Everyone has their own name in the form of url.  Which does not take away.  Each user grows the content of his blog on a particular server.  However, the user is not tied to his server as serfs, but is free to pick up his content and go where it is better.  For other members of the blogosphere, this transition will be absolutely transparent.  Url has not changed.  All this life is watched by a search server.  Collect and cache open information.  Help users find each other. <br><br>  Everyone is happy. <br><br>  PS: I wanted to publish in the blogosphere blog, but they have something broken there.  gives some kind of error about karma.  : - / </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/47753/">https://habr.com/ru/post/47753/</a></p>
