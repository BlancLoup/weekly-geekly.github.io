  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow for innos D6000 is on its way</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello!  Even at the time of the announcement of <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/innos/blog/270252/">the innos entry into the Russian market,</a> we promised that for the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/innos/blog/273450/">innos D6000</a> smartphone, the firmware with Android Marshmallow will be released.  And now we inform you that there are only a few weeks left before the release of this very firmware.  Its beta version has long been installed on the smartphones of all innos Europe employees.  The main bugs (where without them!), We, along with our Chinese colleagues, have already ‚Äúcaught‚Äù, colleagues have fixed bugs, and only a couple of trifles remain.  However, from our point of view, some trivialities are quite critical, and therefore we are not going to release the firmware for the time being. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7d7/46e/3b6/7d746e3b6887ce334a0687d629d1b376.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What can you say about the new firmware?  First, by optimizing power consumption at the level of Android Marshmallow itself, you can count on about a 15 percent increase in battery life of the smartphone.  Roughly speaking, if earlier on innos D6000 with its batteries with a total capacity of 6,000 mAh it was possible to drive in Asphalt 8 for about 8 hours, now it will turn out to reach 9. In other modes - calls, playing music, watching videos - increase plus or minus same. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a40/a15/c1a/a40a15c1a581ab399d42293dda8c713c.jpg">

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Secondly - and this is quite important - the firmware is not based on Android 6.0, but on Android 6.0.1.  For example, for the Oukitel K10000 (here is its <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/innos/blog/277844/">comparison with the innos D6000</a> ), an update with Marshmallow was also released the other day, but version 6.0 is used there.  In 6.0.1, the Google developers, we recall, fixed all the minor errors found after the release of 6.0 (for example, a problem with the system clock), added a number of security-related fixes, and implemented the ability to turn on the camera by double pressing the power button.  In general, it is unlikely that anyone would venture to argue that 6.0.1 is worse than 6.0.  Of course, better! <br><br>  Third, Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow on the innos D6000 looks about the same as the old OS versions.  That is, the black background of the main menu, Material Design is implemented only in part.  The thing is, we didn‚Äôt integrate the Google Start launcher into either the older firmware or the new one.  Some manufacturers integrate, and we believe that the user should provide a choice.  After all, Google Start can be downloaded and delivered from the Play Store in a few seconds.  And get a white background of the main menu, high-grade Material Design and so on.  By the way, we are not adding Google Start, not only we, but even the closest Google partners.  I remember when the firmware for LG Nexus 5 with Android 5.0 came out, the author of the post looked at the pictures on the Internet and saw that the OS had significantly changed the interface - Material Design, everything was fine.  Immediately useful to update your ASUS Nexus 7 (2012).  Updated from 4.4 - and suddenly realized that the interface has not changed at all.  Later it turned out that the Google Experience Launcher launcher (now Google Start) was included in the Nexus 5 firmware, which it also changed.  Now this shell is available on Google Play for Nexus 7 (2012), and for other devices that are not related to the Nexus line. <br><br>  A few screenshots of the firmware from Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow for innos D6000: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e40/011/f41/e40011f41e1144728cd390d5347b9113.png" width="400"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f56/ff5/0de/f56ff50de396b214e4a5a900cf73243d.png" width="400"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0c0/c02/bb2/0c0c02bb26f035a5dc85b5f3a09ae0ed.png" width="400"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3b9/27c/70b/3b927c70b55d68a3c9f0a7786077c11e.png" width="400"><br><br><h2>  Short video review: </h2><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/YXENojAFPGU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjp67FRj2v3uP2zzhx_ghyiDMBAtg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Fourth, it is worth answering those who reproached us for the overly long preparation of Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow for innos D6000.  It is clear that the user wants here and now.  And we strive to work as quickly as possible.  But!  innos D6000 - the device is far from ordinary.  A unique concept with two batteries (built-in at 2 480 and removable at 3,520 mAh) and the ability to hot-swap a removable battery on the fly, without shutting down and rebooting the device, implies a very serious tilling of the Qualcomm system software and its integration with the new version system.  It takes time - alas and ah. <br><br>  Moreover, we wanted to do (and did) so that with Android 6.0.1 there are no new glitches, and the device worked even longer.  And so that we can continue with full responsibility to call the innos D6000 "the most thoughtful smartphone in the world with a powerful battery."  Of course, it was possible to hurry and get hemorrhoids at the exit both for users and for us.  But we do not work that way. <br><br>  Well, it is also worth adding that as of June 2016, the share of the Marshmallow version among all Android versions only slightly <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html">exceeded 10%</a> .  So we did everything faster.  For example, Marshmallow received far from all versions of the Samsung Galaxy S5, which sold millions of copies and, by the way, was the flagship. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f70/9c5/fb0/f709c5fb09d79467aa2c1931d8b07297.png"><br>  <i>Share distribution of Android versions for June 2016</i> <br><br>  The release of firmware from Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow for the European / Russian version of innos D6000 is scheduled for July 2016.  It will be available as an update over the air, and in the version for installation from a PC (all files can be downloaded <a href="https://www.innos.com/ru/software/">here</a> ).  It is worth emphasizing that the Chinese version of innos D6000, not purchased through our <a href="http://innos.com/ru">official Russian website</a> , will not receive this update and will remain on 5.1.1.  Because the Russian / European version is slightly different in hardware - for example, it has support for the LTE Band 38 and 40, which is missing in the Chinese versions. <br><br>  If you have questions regarding the innos D6000, the new firmware and in general our access to the Russian market, you can feel free to ask them in the comments.  We will respond as soon as possible. <br><br>  Some more useful and interesting materials: <br>  ¬ª <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/innos/blog/273450/">Detailed innos D6000 - the most thoughtful smartphone with a powerful battery</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/innos/blog/270252/">About the history of innos and brand entry into the Russian market</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/innos/blog/277384/">Compare innos D6000 with other popular smartphones with powerful batteries</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/innos/blog/277844/">Comparison of two smartphones with the largest batteries in the world - innos D6000 with Oukitel K10000</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/innos/blog/277070/">First results of innos in the Russian market</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395683/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395683/</a></p>
