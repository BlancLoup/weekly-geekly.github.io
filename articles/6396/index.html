  <section class="page js-page"><h1>worldoftides</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> BACKGROUND <br><br>  The World of Tides is created on the basis of space fiction by D.S.  Gradinara "Spreading its wings" and "Gray tide". <br><br>  Human civilization has finally found the opportunity to get rid of the continuous internal wars that once devastated the territories of the Earth and the planetary colonies.  The hard power of the Dominants, who united economics and politics into a single whole, rejecting the previous division of finance, industry and power, has become an instrument that made it possible to achieve a state of peace.  From now on, nothing and no one got out of the control of the Global Solar Council, which was made up of representatives of the five Dominants who divided the spheres of influence.  Over the past two hundred years astronautics has received an incredible pace of development, and people have gone beyond the limits of the solar system, colonizing more and more new worlds.  A significant role in the stellar expansion of mankind was played by the discovery of an amazing phenomenon of the Universe - the Tides, thanks to which space reconnaissance, and after them - huge colonial transports, rushed into the corners of the Milky Way Galaxy, which are unattainable with the usual relativistic burden.  But it was a peaceful colonization.  In the compartments of transports there were colonist detachments, but not assault infantry, equipment for planetary development and terraforming of distant planets, but not gun platforms and rocket launchers.  On board the colonial transports, in the hangars, automatic probes and ore-mining complexes were waiting in the wings, but not combat units of menacing fighter spacecraft.  They will appear later ...

      From the planet to the planet, from the star to the star, caravans moved, claiming man‚Äôs power over space.  But every pilot researcher who entered for the first time in the newly discovered Tide, hoping and holding his breath, was waiting for a meeting with other creatures, a different civilization, a different mind.  To find the answer to the eternal question - are we alone?  Is man alone among the billions of stars in the galaxy? <br><br>  These days are over ... The answer was received.  The first civilization we encountered ‚Äî the Immortals, a race of intelligent worm-like creatures with incredible vitality and possessing unique technologies that surpass the earthly level ‚Äî turned out to be hostile.  The Immortal Race has been expanding for a long time.  But they had a battle fleet capable of destroying the population of the Earth and all the dominions of the Sun. <br><br>  The Oasis of the Pioneers, the planetary system, the Bead Thread, the Euphoria and Oblivion hydroplanes, which once were shining with the cleanliness of the newly built house, are now burned to the ground, destroyed by the planetary bombardments that made them more unfit for human habitation ... maybe - aggressive, hostile to them, maybe - completely defenseless.  Anyway, the purpose of the Immortals' wanderings was not at all creation. <br><br>  On Earth, they still remember the flight of the ‚ÄúMissionary‚Äù.  A distant reconnaissance spaceship was sent with a message of friendship.  The informatorium on its board contained precious experience and achievements of mankind.  Video systems broadcast this event to all corners of the Solar.  It was an unforgettable sight!  Fifty messengers of goodwill ‚Äî engineers and physicians, biologists and historians, people of various specialties ‚Äî proudly climbed the gangway connecting the launch pier and the starship ready for flight.  What happened next - do not forget too.  The starship is back.  Half-charred, with ruined superstructures, destroyed by a signal bridge and gaps in the sides.  There were no survivors.  The ship led the automatics, which at the last moment managed to take it out of the heavy gravitational shelling, on the only surviving engine, back to the Tide.  Sent to eliminate errors, automatic probes were destroyed one by one by the Immortals, without any attempt to make contact ... <br><br>  So began a new era of humanity.  The era of star wars, in which millions and billions were to die.  Colonists, astronauts, equipment mining stations - they all came under attack. <br><br>  While these were marginal worlds, the trouble did not affect the cradle of human civilization - the Earth, and was still far from the planets of the solar system.  The immortals carried out a methodical destruction of industrial and habitable planets, using the tactics of slow but steady extrusion of humanity from outer space.  So we were given to understand that there is no stellar friendship and fraternity between completely different races of intelligent beings, who are equally eager to conquer the galaxy.  In this difficult time, in the midst of doom, chaos and fear, the engineers of the Sun designed ships and stations that could protect the Sun.  Thus, former prejudices, former dreams of conquering the universe, went into oblivion.  And the former ore carriers got a thick skin of armor on the new shipyards, and the licked sides of the cruise liners bristled with the sockets of the gravitational emitters.  So the fleet was born. <br><br>  Dominants, using all available human and material resources, erected giant outposts - Star Fortresses, blocking the tides leading into the solar system.  And here the spheres of influence and areas of responsibility were divided between them, and internal conflicts broke out again, the struggle for the strong to absorb the weak.  Such is human nature ... <br><br>  Since the dominant "Amga-Saale" and "Victoria" were formed as the last power structures, it was they who had to prove their worth, - there, on distant frontiers, when laying the controlled outposts. <br><br>  The fortresses of Asia, Africa and America were erected on the most profitable exits from the Tides.  While the flotilla of civilian and industrial starships were hastily re-equipped as military ships, while their crews, suffering terrifying losses, bleeding to death, were gaining bitter combat experience, while the Immortals only groped for the direction of the main attack, still had the opportunity to strategically place the Fortresses in areas where military supplies were not difficult materials.  In these operational squares, ore accumulations of asteroids rich in deposits of necessary raw materials were in abundance.  But the creation of the fortresses of Australia and Europe was more like the hasty patch of holes in the defense.  By blocking the two remaining Tides leading to the Earth, these outposts could only be satisfied with an irregular supply, in the absence of asteroid and planetary raw materials in the immediate vicinity. <br><br>  The activity of the Immortals, who correctly determined the dependence of outposts on supplies, was much higher in these areas than in other Fortresses.  This did not allow spraying the forces of the VKS - Military Space Fleet concentrated here - on the barrage of service and the simultaneous extraction of strategic materials in remote locations.  In the event of a weakening of the combat fleet based here, the breakthrough of the Immortals would be fatal to the Sun. <br><br>  The first unsuccessful attempt to organize something like a special supply fleet led to the emergence of real pirate freemen, the so-called "irreconcilable".  A group of pilots who deserted from the VKS, announced its readiness to begin hostilities against the Dominants immediately after the end of the war.  The option in which the Earth would lose the battle was not taken into account.  It would be nonsense to calculate the consequences of such a catastrophe as the destruction of the Earth.  Therefore, the ‚Äúirreconcilables‚Äù, having established their own bases in secluded corners of deep space, waged their own struggle against the Immortals.  They were not mad at all.  Rather, idealists, fans who oppose the globalization of power.  One way or another, I had to find another way out.  Finally, common sense and long negotiations between the Dominants, allowed him to find ... <br><br>  The Earth‚Äôs combat fleet has not yet become a smashing sword, fulfilling the role of an exclusively shield that cracks from enemy strikes.  But you can't wait for the enemy to accumulate enough strength to pierce him?  Yes, we are building spaceships, the Jupiter shipyards stamp them without stopping.  There, at Jupiter, in the rings of automatic plants, real hell was going on!  Often, not only people could withstand, but also equipment ... At the same time, laboratories and military workshops are preparing new weapons, enhanced engines, protection and everything else that a warship needs.  Everything, except for the only thing - pilots.  Those who must control the spaceships.  Those who are able to oppose the pressure of the enemy are not only the speed of ballistic calculators, the speed of accelerating engines, the artillery and rocket power of the ship, but also their own will to win, their fearlessness, faith in human superiority over alien beasts. <br><br>  The selection of astronauts for the fortress fleets was strict.  Not everyone is given to withstand the exhausting tension of the battle being waged at near-light speeds, not everyone can be spurred by modifications of the superreaction, superfast performance of the brain and muscle tissue.  Total mobilization did not solve the issue.  After all, all our abilities are hidden deeply - at the genetic level, and this is a stubborn fact.  There were enough forces to recruit detachments and groups of assault infantry, as well as an excess of industrial facilities for the manufacture of new starships.  But there was not enough raw materials to maintain these crazy paces, there were not enough people who are genetically suitable for turning pilots of warships into pilots.  A vicious circle looped around the neck of the struggling humanity ... And at the same time, in distant sectors of space, scanners caught the presence of deposits of raw materials and strategic materials.  Who will go after them?  Who will be able to conduct a caravan of cargo ships, even if equipped with missile weapons and emitters of melee weapons?  Who will go and return - with loot!  With new blood for pulsating military veins?  And yet, on Earth there are three and a half billion Lowmen, who do not have the necessary gene, to become pilots of videoconferencing, living on social benefits, cut down to impossibility with the start of the war, people who were waiting for their fate - to get into the assault infantry , mortality has already reached ninety percent, or die in the event of a breakthrough of the Immortals.  And the enemy was able to revive their own pilots and warriors from the only surviving cell that carries the DNA code.  Three and a half billion - on Earth, and about a billion - in the remaining dominions.  Hundreds of refugees with ships launched to the Sun, but what awaited them on Earth?  The same uncertainty ... <br><br>  It was then that the program of stewardship came into being. <br><br>  In the old era of the conquest of maritime spaces, the free captain was considered a privateer, to whom the government issued a license to conduct war and piracy against the enemy state.  The close medieval system of privateing was chosen as dominant for transferring a part of economic activity in the external sectors to independent captains who were ready to conduct dangerous operations, constantly risking to run into patrols and raids of the Immortals.  Such a system proved to be very effective, each captain was responsible only for himself and made decisions himself, choosing the best opportunity for himself, such efficiency and flexibility allowed star privateers to quickly spread their enterprises to all external sectors.  The dominants needed only to create the necessary infrastructure for privateers, to supply the necessary material supplies and space stations in which privateers could conduct their business.  All the measures taken and the costs quickly paid off, the dominants ceased to incur excessive losses, and privateers spread throughout the cosmos and provided inflows of rare resources to the solar system, which, together with risky trade, allowed supplying some enterprises with dominants that were highly dependent on VKS patrols.  Later, the Captains who received a license for space privateering were nicknamed ‚ÄúScapers‚Äù from the Old English Space Caper. <br><br>  So, we were given a patent for shooting any alien evil spirits, which only will meet on the way.  They gave an opportunity to see worlds where no one has ever been before.  Gave a chance in life!  But at the same time they shouldered a heavy burden.  From now on, everything is a desperate resident of the Earth, a refugee miner who lost his home, a pilot of a truck or a passenger liner, who does not have a damned transformation gene in his blood ... We are all the army of the Solar Supply, left to ourselves.  We are the most important component of the VKS fleet, without which the fortresses cannot survive.  And damn it, this transformation gene!  We will get our experience in battle!  We, who could not swim, were thrown into the stormy sea.  But the one who will find the strength to rise above the wave, bring the starship exactly on target, take what belongs only to him - by right of the strong!  - and break through the chain of enemy patrol ships, he will become a real sky-marque, deep-space filibuster, which knows no doubts and fear! <br><br>  Let pilots of VKS, tied up like chain dogs to Fortresses, boast, let them brag about their training and giant battleships.  Without us they are - no one!  Predatory animals sitting in a cage.  And we have to feed them with the hand. <br><br>  Happiness, when there is a cluster of asteroids saturated with hyperstructures, a material without which it is impossible to recreate the combat optics of starships.  Double happiness, if in a loose boulder, for billions of years compressed from cosmic dust, a special stratum is found that contains a protograph - the compound from which nanotubes are chosen for making ultrafast calculators: ballistic, tactical, command, navigation ... rubble will be the only stone containing particles of gravikvazer.  The capabilities of the fleet ‚Äî ours and the Immortals ‚Äî depended entirely on this unique formation.  We do not pick up, take the enemy, so the question was. <br><br>  A crystal the size of a wheat grain, hitting a splitter, gave enough energy to provide the city quarter for the whole year!  In our torpedoes - three quasi crystals.  Each launch is a step to victory, but at the same time - three blocks of the Megapolis, left without energy.  And splitters of overclocking engines destroy hundreds and hundreds of crystals!  The earth more and more plunged into darkness, remaining without light, warmth, and without the usual luxury of civilization.  A short blanket, which can not simultaneously cover the legs and head.  A short blanket on a frosty night ... <br><br>  While the Earth was in lethargic sleep, the VKS fleet was to ensure its safety.  And our, skaperskiy, fleet - ensured the viability of videoconferencing.  And more and more often, going out on a raid, we hear the wishes of combat pilots behind our backs. <br><br>  ‚ÄúHey, scooter!  Come back with loot!  We are waiting for you!" <br>  ¬© GDTeam <a href="http://worldoftides.ru/">Source</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/6396/">https://habr.com/ru/post/6396/</a></p>
