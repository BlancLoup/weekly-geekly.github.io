  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to get feedback without registration and SMS. Pro reviews from colleagues and clients</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  My name is Kate Frank and I work a lot with feedback. <br><br>  We all love to receive feedback on our work, and we love it very much when we are praised and upset when we are criticized.  This is normal because we are human and prone to emotion.  At the same time, we ourselves, with much greater pleasure, give precisely negative feedback, and this is also normal, because we are human. <br><br>  In this article, I will talk about what kind of feedback happens and what mistakes we make, when we give it, what most people would like to see, and about sore points - about how, in my experience, it's better to ask about it when it comes to For example, feedback from customers.

    <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zf/3f/lt/zf3fltgykz8fmzyeizid2_oxxpc.jpeg" width="300"></div><br>  But first, a small disastrous life story. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In one large restaurant chain, the staff motivation system was tied, including through feedback from customers (guests).  According to a complex system of coefficients, the rating of institutions was calculated and bonuses to employees were calculated.  Moreover, both feedback from the site, from the mail of the quality department, and "asterisks" in the application and evaluation of visits were taken into account.  It would seem a transparent and convenient scheme?  Everything was going well until it was accidentally found out that when calculating the restaurant staff asked the guests to like the visit and indicate the name of the waiter who served them.  In general, it is not difficult at all and there have been quite a lot of such reviews to attract the attention of security guards and HR.  What kind of transparency of the scheme can we talk about if employees have the opportunity to wind themselves votes?  It turns out that the review is not sincere, and people will get extra charges for it.  And then a key decision was made: to limit the possibility of submitting such a review.  According to the new rules, it became possible to leave feedback about the visit only 3 hours after the check was closed.  At the same time, any estimate below 5k was automatically considered as non-fulfillment of the plan for this indicator and was minus from the premium.  Guess what happened in the end?  What normal person will go into the application at all three hours after dinner to leave someone a compliment or write a thank you on the site?  Yes, no!  Only those who didn‚Äôt like it, got nasty, were tasteless and salty, bitter coffee, dirty floors (underline the necessary ones).  The result - a rapid drop in statistics on all indicators in restaurants, staff deprived of bonuses, as a result - a falling level of service, offended and demotivated personnel, dismissals, staff turnover.  Complete failure, right? <br><br>  So! <br><br>  <b>I internally got used to divide any feedback into two types:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  The first type is constructive reviews, criticism and everything that usually remains inside the company.  Usually this is something that is discussed at project meetings, DSM and flyers and is not carried out to the outside information field.  Let's call it <b>internal feedback</b> . </li><li>  The second type is all commercial.  First of all, these are customer reviews, likes and comments in social networks or appstor, the results of survey forms, reviews and press releases (not prepaid, of course).  In general, everything that is customary to be proud of and that you want to publish immediately, because we have been praised!  Let's call it <b>reviews</b> . </li></ul><br><h3>  Internal feedback. </h3><br>  How many times have you been going to the project team to discuss some stage or the result of the work and as a result it turned into a collective stream of criticism of the format ‚Äúeverything is all right, but now let's talk about the jambs!‚Äù?  What happens to the one who actually did the job?  It's no secret that we all feel at this moment.  It becomes terribly offensive.  The feeling that everyone sees only mistakes and no one in the whole wide world can simply say ‚Äúyou are good‚Äù.  It also seems that the meeting turned into a competition "whoever finds more mistakes in the work of N will receive an award."  Familiar? <br><br>  Our company has a graphic designer Anya.  It took about a year for Ani to build the processes of writing TK and preparing tasks for designers, as well as re-educating the team.  ‚ÄúCriticizing - suggest,‚Äù Anya always says and harshly suppresses all those who comment on the layout ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like everything here.‚Äù  It turned out that a truly constructive and reasoned criticism, aimed at helping to make the product better, and not at hurting or offending a person, is an art.  All of us are personalities, everyone has their own opinion and sometimes it is even too much and we love to express it, but we do not follow the argument.  We are just learning, and Anya will write an article about all these painful processes in the near future, and we will try to publish it without criticizing. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/b3/3a/jj/b33ajj1s0ig4duarmw-xx0r7lhs.jpeg"></div><br>  Recently, Anya published a <a href="https://habr.com/company/mobile_dimension/blog/418919/">translation of the article</a> , which describes in some detail about the stresses in the designer‚Äôs life, but this also applies to all other participants in the workflow. <br><br>  <b>Announcing a future article about processes and feedback, I would like to mention simple rules of communication:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  If someone‚Äôs criticism or harsh comments during work meetings really offend and upset you, but don‚Äôt help at all, feel free to say so.  The really cool projects are made only in those teams in which people respect colleagues and each other's work, and do not seek to offend or hurt.  Learn to understand each other.  Feel free to say: ‚ÄúListen, this is unconstructive, emotional and evil, let's be better!‚Äù And you will be surprised how much easier it will be to breathe. </li><li>  <b>"Criticizing - offer</b> . <b>"</b>  Just learn to give a detailed commentary after the phrase ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like it‚Äù.  It is important not just to explain what exactly and why you do not like, but to give recommendations, no matter how stupid they are, how it can be improved.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like this picture <i>because</i> it looks like a bomb explosion‚Äù is a bad feedback.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like it, <i>but it seems that if</i> these lines are painted green, it will look like a tree and look different and better‚Äù is already perceived differently. </li><li>  Always put yourself in the shoes of another person before saying something.  Think about how much work he has done to come to you with what you are discussing.  This is not even a bit going out and telling everyone: "Look, I did, now I am ready to listen to criticism from you."  Respect the time and strength of others if you want yours to be respected. </li><li>  Praise more often!  Do not start your comments with negatives, start with compliments.  To disassemble only shoals is a bad tactic, it demotivates and knocks the ground out from under their feet.  You want to be praised too :) It is best to observe harmony and use the positive-negative-positive sandwich scheme in your comments. </li><li>  And most importantly, all people are different.  We often forget about this simple thing.  Everyone is different and the perception is different, so your opinion is not the truth in the first instance, and we cannot force other people to do something exactly as we imagine in our head. </li></ol><br><h3>  Reviews </h3><br>  Now, probably the most interesting.  It's no secret that everyone is proud of the feedback from customers and is happy to publish them at the earliest opportunity.  In 90% of cases on sites offering any services or products, you can find a whole section with reviews, and when you come to the office to contractors - a wall with letters and thanks.  We are, by the way, no exception. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/og/tl/gj/ogtlgj4g-5hwtucyffrt8s--sl0.jpeg"></div>  <i>Source: Garden State film</i> <br><br>  When I came to work in the team, I was faced with the task of adjusting the collection of customer feedback.  In the beginning it seemed to me that there was absolutely nothing complicated here, but I can talk to people.  After a year and a half, the task is still standing, the perfect recipe has not yet been found, and I find myself, the article is not about the best way to collect compliments, but only about a few life hacks that I have tested, but with different success, but work. <br><br>  In addition to the fact that in the world of marketing and PR you cannot simply take and publish a review or mention, but you need to coordinate it with client PR, brand manager, director, president and a whole army of people, there is also the lower part of the iceberg - how to get it at all.  Surely, many were faced with a situation when the project was completed, the acts were signed, the client is happy and here it is, the coveted moment ‚Äúcould you not leave a review?‚Äù, But instead of a review you get ‚Äúyes, yes, of course, just let's do a little later‚Äù.  Most often, this is the last letter you can get. <br><br>  During the time that I collect feedback, I tried a lot of things and I want to share some of the life stories that I use in my life every day. <br><br><ol><li>  First, just accept it.  No one will ever send you a review himself, will not voluntarily go somewhere to sign and print on a beautiful corporate paper with a logo.  This happens in life in two cases from twenty and in American films.  In my memory, it was only four times, and then, I did not ask for it, it happened by itself.  And it does not mean that you are working poorly or you have bad projects.  Just the people who work in your client, are arranged exactly the same as you yourself.  You have rendered a service or sold a product, they are satisfied or at least satisfied.  Write about this review and carry it somewhere, and then send - this is somehow too much, and there is no time.  Another thing, if something did not suit them!  Believe me, you would get a review even earlier than the project would have ended in the volume of four volumes. </li><li>  Write reviews and press releases yourself.  Even if it is a press release, which for you on your site will publish a PR client, "who could have done it himself."  Could, but will not.  If you do not do this, no one will do it and they certainly will not.  This is necessary not for them, but for you.  Write the text, send it to them and ask for approval.  It is captivating, because you have already done half the work for them, it remains only to sign with your boss or sign for yourself. </li><li>  Try to agree in advance that you will then request a review.  Include this item in the contract if possible.  Ask for permission to place the logo.  Use all your seduction skills, but be sure to fix the arrangements in the mail.  There is nothing worse than a scandal with a client who did not allow you to post something at home. </li><li>  Never post anything about customers whose relationships have for some reason deteriorated.  For example, you screwed up.  Or in your opinion, the client screwed up, but you are guilty anyway.  In any case, post reviews and logos are not worth it.  You just provoke a wave of negativity.  Moreover, I do not recommend extreme experiments with the placement of anything that is directly prohibited, either verbally or in writing. </li><li> When requesting feedback, warn immediately why you need it.  Someone does not want to be published in social networks or does not like to glow at all.  And someone will be happy to give feedback, but according to their rank they cannot sign on their own.  Specify these points in order not to accidentally offend the manager of your client or not to substitute himself. </li><li>  Never delay getting a review.  If you meet the client personally, suggest sending it to him right now, without delaying (text prepared in advance, of course).  Remember that after he goes on vacation and returns, the last thing on earth when analyzing 100,500 letters is he will want to sign your review with his boss. </li><li>  Never praise yourself and your company excessively!  Reviews of the format "Unsurpassed service, we are delighted with the services," and so on - this is too much.  Write clean, clear, neutral, but with a positive coloring of the text. </li><li>  Always respond to negative feedback.  Approach this caution, avoid the hackneyed phrases like ‚Äúthanks for your opinion, it is very important for us‚Äù and do not ignore angry messages.  They are kosyachat everything, even the best, but you need to be able to work with objections.  If there are objections in open space, like a Facebook mention or a media review, find the strength to discuss it inside and prepare a weighted answer.  Do not entrust it to the smm department; they are not obliged to single-handedly understand that someone is dissatisfied with the services of the company. </li><li>  Post on your site only good or neutral reviews.  A negative review published for a potential client looks exactly as you imagine it to be - ‚Äúoh, a bad review was published to dilute‚Äù.  It is obvious to all that the company's website is a marketing tool designed to show the company in the best light.  However, if on any other resource your company is open for commenting and reviews, I do not advise you to remove the negative, it is enough just to moderate the message flow. </li><li>  Come up with some value for the client.  What will he or the company give this whole undertaking?  It is unlikely that a huge corporation is interested in simply mentioning it on your site and they consider it informational, to be honest.  But the mention on the IT resource or participation in the review, which will underline their technological expertise or some other steepness - is another matter.  Try to find the key to your client and what will be important for him. </li><li>  Forget about feedback forms and Google polls from 20 questions "Rate from 1 to 5 ..." or "write what you like about our decision."  Nobody fills them.  If you really want to question someone - hand out a short questionnaire at the event, promise everyone who has filled out some prize (discount coupon in your service) and take it easy. </li><li>  Really publish what you promise to publish!  You'd be surprised, but many of those who agree to publish reviews, then wonder how they and their statements look on your resources.  When you ask for a month to give a comment, and then it goes into the noosphere - you are unlikely to receive it again. </li><li>  Well, finally the last.  The word ‚ÄúReview‚Äù or ‚Äúrating‚Äù generally scares people.  We ourselves hang up the phone after talking to the call center, not wanting to waste time assessing something there.  When I hear the word "review", I imagine how I will be forced to write, fill in, reply, send photos ... Figure out how to get away from this word altogether.  Ask at the end of the project: ‚ÄúWell, how do you like our solution?  Are you satisfied? ‚Äù, And having received the answer, ask permission to publish, explaining that you are really very pleased to receive such a cool comment. </li></ol><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fk/ov/3z/fkov3zqmkr5texidu0wcheecxcg.jpeg"></div><br><h4>  Few examples </h4><br>  <i>All pictures are taken from the Internet.</i> <br><br>  As for the wording and specific advice on the visualization of their requests - do not use imperative and any imperative forms.  Smaller points at the end, mandible intonations. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zg/tx/ie/zgtxieqg5t7se9fxde07vmp2oiw.jpeg"></div>  <i>Who is important?</i> <i><br></i> <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9b/nc/tw/9bnctw-yidbrrdoei_xbbh1yx-c.jpeg"></div>  <i>I would like to answer ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, but I don‚Äôt want to type some link from the phone.</i>  <i>Why not place a QR with a link to the institution's page?</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8k/tg/rn/8ktgrn6epe6ux_vip-xytp2wg7g.jpeg"></div>  <i>Please note that dissatisfied users or users in confusion do not offer to leave a review.</i> <br><br>  By the way, did you notice for yourself, what irritation does the script question ‚ÄúThis information was useful to you?‚Äù Cause after an absolutely useless conversation with any technical support?  Analyze the relevance of such requests for ‚Äúthank-you letters‚Äù after a failed project.  Think about changing the wording. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-v/pe/nv/-vpenv_ywajpak7lmvcsj_j1ivk.png"></div>  <i>The "subscribe to news and discounts" scenario should not be practiced if the user or client is dissatisfied with or minus you.</i>  <i>Trying to slip him some kind of newsletter will only cause even more irritation.</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lf/ll/1g/lfll1gpnj41jhmidfr3fxrhqikc.jpeg"></div><br>  Practice negative reviews, fix them, and don‚Äôt try to bother a client who has already said several times that he will not give you a response, your offer is not interesting and ‚Äúnever call me again‚Äù.  Everyone knows the words that in your CRM client should always remain in the funnel and you can call him endlessly, sometimes bad friends with common sense.  Such a feature is often distinguished by banks and microfinance organizations, and after a million calls, you only want one thing - to be deprived of all of their licenses. <br><br>  What else?  The last thing I want to say is that we always forget that feedback may not always be explicit.  You can not persuade the client to publish, interview, logo or review?  Invite him as a speaker or expert to your event and include information about it in the program.  Use the fact that your client is the same person as you.  Do you like compliments?  :) <br><br>  If someone managed to find an approach to the client, which I have not tried, and which leads to the desired result - share in the comments! <br><br>  Katya Frank, Head of Mobile Dimension Marketing </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/421165/">https://habr.com/ru/post/421165/</a></p>
