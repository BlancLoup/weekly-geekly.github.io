  <section class="page js-page"><h1>All in 1: Fujitsu ESPRIMO X913-T Monoblock</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The concept of "monoblock PC" is not new in the IT world, but such solutions are rarely found in apartments or offices as well.  Meanwhile, among them come across very interesting devices!  For example, the new Fujitsu ESPRIMO X913-T. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/76d/4d2/c3f/76d4d2c3f5161d2d44a52d9edd695553.jpg"><br><br>  The modern user, spoiled by thin monitors, the thickness of a normal candy bar only hurts the eye.  Therefore, the X913-T developers went to the trick: they placed all the components of the system unit not in the monitor case, but in the stand, killing two birds with one stone at a time: and the monitor was made fashionably thin, and the stand became large and massive, due to which the system acquired increased resistance to rollover.  The user received an elegant 23-inch monitor, which has a lot of useful connectors in the stand - and there is no longer any need to climb under the table to plug in a USB flash drive or headphones, and IT-Schniki ... They are paradise at all: reducing the number of cords by two (monitor power and DVI ) repeatedly increases reliability, because the banal loss of contact is one of the most common reasons for calling an IT specialist to a workplace. <a name="habracut"></a>

However, this is only a basic version, there are also more advanced sets, up to a 2.4 GHz LX900 wireless kit with a ten-button laser mouse as an option. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b9c/746/fc2/b9c746fc23a0b15536a7222dfa672e10.jpg"><br><br>  The X913-T display has two degrees of freedom - the lower leg bracket allows the panel to be raised and lowered, and the upper one to rotate within very wide limits.  The screen can even be deployed horizontally and use it as a large tablet, since it is touch sensitive and detects up to ten simultaneous touches. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/89c/6e9/082/89c6e9082f4da7e327c001960d542fd1.jpg"><br><br>  This begs the question, what should the user sacrifice for beauty and convenience?  In fact, nothing but a discrete video adapter and optical drive - yes, that did not fit.  In general, inside the X913-T is more than worthy.  Fujitsu's own D3204 motherboard is based on the Intel Q77 Express chipset and has all the relying capabilities (USB 3.0, gigabit network controller, vPro).  Given Fujitsu's extensive experience in the design and manufacture of motherboards, this is a serious bid for the stable operation of a candy bar over the years.  The board uses a low-voltage processor for an LGA1155 socket up to an Intel Core i5 vPro, and up to 16 GB of DDR3-1600 memory with two SO-DIMM modules, a 2.5-inch hard drive, or solid-state drive ‚Äî that is,  quite serious configurations are available. <br><br>  In addition to performance, Fujitsu decided to please the user and the picture, providing a monoblock monitor with an IPS matrix.  The price was not affected too much, but the viewing angles are much better, and the colors do not float when tilting the line of sight, and this is very important when working at a computer.  An interesting detail is that there is a kind of oblong device above the X913-T monitor, and this is not a simple webcam, which you can guess by its size. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f37/95d/926/f3795d926480592f565c7de4bcea9e71.jpg"><br><br>  This Fujitsu know-how is a multifunctional module.  It will hold a webcam, microphone and ultrasonic presence sensor.  The most obvious application of this module is participation in videoconferences, but this will not surprise anyone now.  But the login feature of face recognition is not yet found very often.  The ultrasonic sensor will block the session when the user leaves the computer, which also has a beneficial effect on safety and energy saving.  However, the behavior of the candy bar in this regard is flexibly configured. <br><br>  Regarding security and administration features.  Implying the use of the X913-T in the corporate sector, the developers at Fujitsu supplied it with a smartcard reader, a TPM module.  As befits a serious office machine, the all-in-one PCB fully supports Intel vPro and iAMT.  In addition, it is worth considering the DeskView management pack, which is developed and maintained by Fujitsu itself - with its help you can easily monitor the operation of the machine and, if necessary, manage it. <br><br>  Of course, she could not circumvent Fujitsu and such a current topic as energy saving.  This issue was approached in all seriousness and not limited to the simple installation of a low-voltage processor.  So, the power supply unit is certified 80 PLUS Gold and its efficiency reaches 90% and does not fall below 87% even with a load of 10%.  Thanks to the LED backlight and the advanced power control module, the monitor ‚Äúeats‚Äù a few watts, and the system as a whole consumes about 31 W in idle time - and this is, for example, the main operating mode for an office PC. <br><br>  In conclusion, it is worth mentioning the urgent problem of noise pollution.  You are at home, or at work - various technicians constantly rustle around you, and computers make a very weighty contribution to this cacophony.  You can get used to this noise and stop noticing it, but it will not disappear from this, and will continue to damage your health.  But ESPRIMO X913-T practically does not participate in this - its noise level does not exceed 18 dB in idle mode, which can be compared, perhaps, with a quiet whisper. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/171547/">https://habr.com/ru/post/171547/</a></p>
