The situation is simple: I bought a product in a certain store, indicated an ebeytudy address, everything is as usual.  But the store delays the shipment of the goods and sent a notice saying that we are sorry, we are delaying, the letter weighs 28 grams.  and their 2 pieces.  I don't need them, I used them, for which the ebeydudei wrote off $ 16.  Although I do not need these letters nafig and I did not order them.  I think many are familiar with the situation when the store sends a notice or advertising message. <br><br>  Posted in support with the hope of an adequate solution to the problem: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <br>  <b>ET:</b> Good afternoon! <br>  On our website in the Help section of <a href="http://ebaytoday.ru/help">ebaytoday.ru/help it is</a> stated ‚ÄúIf you want to dispose of MF, you will be charged a fee for sending, depending on the weight of your tariff plan‚Äù <br>  You sent a parcel for recycling and you were charged a fee for recycling according to your tariff plan. <br><br>  <b>Me:</b> But I have no other choice?  If I do not recycle, I will write off the money for storage

      <b>ET:</b> You have a choice: dispose of the package or send it.  We, as an intermediary, fulfilled our conditions, we took the parcel-letter to the warehouse.  Further, the choice is yours, what to do with the parcel. <br><br>  <b>Me:</b> But I did not order this parcel to your address ... If a dozen more shops send advertisements to me on my own initiative, why should I pay for it ??! <br><br>  <b>ET:</b> If letters, parcels arrive in the name of our user, we are obliged to accept and enter them into the system.  We do not know what our users are ordering, so they are obliged to make all purchases in the system.  If you do not want to send you catalogs or any other correspondence from the stores where you place orders, indicate on the site that you do not want to receive correspondence from the sites. <br><br>  <b>Me:</b> In this case, it was not an ad-type correspondence, it was an excuse saying that we are delaying the delivery of your order.  And it does not depend on me whether they send such a letter or not.  As for you do not know what they are ordering - for this there is a section WAITING FOR A SEND.  so I did not wait for the letter.  It seems to me not logical to pay $ 8 for an unnecessary A4 sheet, which I did not order <br><br>  <b>ET:</b> We do not hide parcels, letters, and we cannot know whether it is necessary or not.  Section I‚Äôm waiting for the package to be filled not by all users, so we can‚Äôt focus only on this section.  Hundreds of packages a day come and there is no information about them in this section. <br><br>  <b>Me:</b> And whose is the problem that the site is not made a phased order of the goods and is not written in huge red letters to fill this section?  Well, or another solution to the problem is to make a tick receive a correspondence from stores in my name or not.  Or it is banal not to take money for the disposal of purchases weighing less than 50 grams.  You can solve this problem, you just have to want it.  Specifically, in my case, there is such a thing - loyalty to customers and just common sense.  Because of principle, you will simply lose the client, and since I think this problem is not my only one, it is still worse. <br><br>  <b>ET:</b> We have the service Your address in the USA, hundreds of parcels, letters and other correspondence come to our address, we cannot check every such letter and decide whether we need a correspondence or not.  When ordering, notify the store that you do not want to receive from them catalogs, letters to this address.  Solve this issue in advance with the stores in which you place orders. <br><br>  Generally as the wall: ( <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> problem <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_angry/117902/">solved</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117902/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117902/</a></p>
