  <section class="page js-page"><h1>JavaScript application for iPad. Couple of tips</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> I got a project on adapting a flash e-learning course for iPad. <br>  I wanted to share some points. <br><br>  <b>Media</b> <br>  The project was supposed to allow playing video / audio files, and without unnecessary movements by the user. <br>  IPad video can only be played by clicking on something, i.e.  automatically play a media file, for example, when you load the page does not work, or it turns out, but not in all versions of iOS. <br>  So the first time to play video / audio has to click on the user.  Further, if the src attribute is changed to the same tag, catching the onended event, playback can be done automatically. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  There were several problems with this part of the project: <br>  1. Before the file was uploaded, the video tag showed a QuickTime logo. <br>  display: none or visibility: hidden did not work.  Helped -webkit-transform: translateX (-2048px). <br>  2. Some kind of jerking of sound took place before the video was loaded and ready to play.  The problem was solved by checking the readyState property of the video tag. <br>  3. For some reason, sometimes, by clicking the user, instead of the desired video file, an audio file was played.  I read that in iOS the media object is implemented as a singleton, i.e.  There can be only one instance per page.  In general, this is all theory and this did not make me any easier.  I tried to delete the src attribute or make it empty - no effect.  By experimenting, src = ".." helped (src = "." Still did not help).  Probably, it was possible to come up with something more beautiful, but since  it was impossible to delete media tags and then I was very tired of this glitch, then I left everything that way. <br><br>  So, playing the video file do this: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
     <code>$(video).css("-webkit-transform", "translateX(-2048px)"); // -     <br> <br> /*       ,      */ <br> video.play(); <br> if(video.readyState !== 4){ <br> setTimeout(function(){ <br> video.pause(); <br> }, 1); <br> } <br> <br> /*   ,       */ <br> $(video).bind("canplaythrough", function(){ <br> $(video).css("-webkit-transform", "translateX(0)"); <br> video.play(); <br> });</code> <br> <br>  Another point about the video - clicking on it will not be able to catch, you need to put a layer on top and have an event to track on it. <br><br>  <b>Window events</b> <br>  1. ononline, onoffline - it was necessary to track the connection to the Internet in order to show the user some warnings and, if possible, to continue working. <br>  2. onpageshow - works when the user does not close the window, clicked on the ‚Äúhome‚Äù button on the device itself, and then went back to safari. <br>  3. onorientationchange - works out when switching between portrait and landscape modes of the device itself.  Here you can catch window.orientation value to determine the mode. <br>  4. onbeforeunload - this seemingly standard iPad event does not work.  I had to download the entire application to the external iframe and monitor the onunload event. <br><br>  <b>Animation</b> <br>  1. Better to do with the help of css, using -webkit-transition.  It works much faster, and this is very important, especially for iPad1. <br>  2. Instead of animating the top and left properties, use translate3d. <br>  3. The scale is well animated, it can come in handy when switching between portrait and landscape modes. <br>  4. The opacity, width, height are badly animated, especially if the element has -webkit-box-shadow. <br><br>  <b>CSS</b> <br>  Everything is very good here, one browser and many useful features. <br>  1. As far as possible, you need to avoid downloading pictures.  Gradients, circles, triangles - everything can be done in styles. <br>  2. The fastest way to hide items is with the translate3d or translateX properties. <br>  3. You need to study the ‚Äìweb-kit css properties, which can save a lot of time.  Here you can see <a href="http://css-infos.net/properties/webkit">http://css-infos.net/properties/webkit</a> . <br><br>  <b>Touch events</b> <br>  1. I used jQuery Mobile, I really had to dig it up a bit, otherwise it added extra tags to the page.  In svzak with scrollview plugin, a powerful scroller is obtained.  I also tried <a href="http://cubiq.org/iscroll">http://cubiq.org/iscroll</a> <br>  2. For Drag'n'Drop, I used this plugin <a href="http://www.gotproject.com/blog/post2.html">http://www.gotproject.com/blog/post2.html</a> , though I had to finish it, because  it did not take into account the scale value of the elements. <br>  3. Instead of clicking, I used touchstart whenever possible ‚Äî much faster. <br><br>  <b>Performance</b> <br>  1. iPad1 and iPad2 are very different in performance, so it is better to develop using iPad1. <br>  2. It would be good to avoid serious manipulations with the addition / removal of DOM elements - iPad1 sometimes just bent over me. <br>  3. Also, it is better to connect the files in the application header using, say, headjs.com, without this, sometimes the browser crashes without warning. <br><br>  In general, the impression of work remained mixed - constantly had to look for some hacks, and because of this, there was often a feeling that everything was not going the way it should be.  In my assessment of the project, I made a mistake twice due to the fact that I had never worked with iPad devices before. <br>  But when I looked at the result at the end of the work, it was pleasant. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136738/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136738/</a></p>
