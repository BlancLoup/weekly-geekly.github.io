      The company ‚ÄúDadzhet‚Äù sent me the ‚ÄúDawn‚Äù light-clock ‚Äî a device that can be referred to as a ‚Äúclock radio‚Äù as a first approximation.  Remember, these were: a red (blue) display, glowing poisonously at night and interfering with sleep, and a loud wake-up call in the form of an unexpectedly on radio.  Well, if with music in the style of "relax" or cheerful "heavy metal".  And sometimes something else happens, to which the young organism, not quite rested, was not accustomed.  For example, the thunder in the literary radio readings for the uncooperative. <br><br>  In general, one can be surprised to learn that alarm clocks are among the most relevant gadgets.  In the era of smartphones, it would seem, the end of the clock has already come ... However, they, it turns out, have retained their narrow and specific niche. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What is the "highlight" of the "Dawn" light-clock room?  His "trick" in the wake-up algorithm.  A few minutes before the beep, which can be not only the radio, but also the sounds of a waterfall, the traditional buzzer and the birds singing (the time is adjusted), the gadget's egg-shaped cap begins to glow, gradually gaining brightness and color tone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/04b/004/e71/04b004e7137746daaba44beb7ee0fa53.jpg"><br><br>  According to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe developers, the photobud simulates dawn, helping to wake up in a more humane and human way.  Therefore, some of the massiveness of the device - because of the size of the frosted canopy, illuminated from the inside by powerful three-color controlled LEDs. <br><br>  In addition to the main function, but rather in addition to it, the device can be used as a night lamp with adjustable color and brightness. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a6/b83/9c8/3a6b839c868347fd974acda3b546928d.jpg"><br><br>  You can run a program of continuous color change, the ceiling will be poured: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fc0/756/805/fc0756805875490c9b35544ddd3b89de.jpg"><br><br>  During the day, this alarm clock works as an ordinary clock, adding some romance to a room: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb5/63e/7d1/fb563e7d13eb47cf83a7493467bdab7d.jpg"><br><br>  In addition, AM / FM radio is built into it - the antenna represented by the wiring and the small speaker at the back are shown here: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/14c/dd5/ad1/14cdd5ad133140c4bc68a20cca4ba3be.jpg"><br><br>  There, among the numerous control buttons, you can see the AUX input for an external audio source: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ea/ead/2b4/6eaead2b4a5745c3ad2a1ce43f80e9c0.jpg"><br><br>  The alarm clock is powered by and 220 V, but when you turn off the settings does not lose, thanks to the batteries: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ced/748/b22/ced748b22018429ca8c7ed12953b5695.jpg"><br><br>  For wake-up, you can use, firstly, a pre-tuned radio - not an option for me, for sure.  Given the repertoire of local FM radio stations, the alarm clock will want to turn off the shotgun. <br><br>  Secondly - external audio source via AUX.  But this is not very clear, because there is no command interface for its inclusion.  Is that it will have its own alarm clock, but then what is it all about? <br><br>  And, thirdly, the built-in signals, called the "sounds of nature."  On the video, you can listen to all four options, but you can recognize the first one as something more or less useful - something like the cricket trills, and the fourth, which the wife immediately called ‚Äúpeacocks screaming‚Äù.  The third, apparently, should depict the cries of gulls over the sea, but more like a baby crying in the bathroom, and the second (perhaps symbolizing the sound of rain), rather causes associations with the toilet.  In my pioneering childhood, they cruelly joked about sleeping comrades in the camp ... <br><br>  Video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lp36a9L3-Iw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Nevertheless, having experimented, I can note that it is really to wake up in the ‚Äúfirst light, then sound‚Äù mode somewhat more comfortable than from an alarm clock in the phone, suddenly screaming under the ear.  I belong to that happy part of humanity, which does not use alarm clocks, but the children doomed to kindergarten and school, rated the effect positively. <br><br>  Some internal device.  The cap was snaps and lifted without effort and tool.  Below it is a white LED matrix and two ‚Äúfor chroma‚Äù RGB LEDs: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/997/80d/807/99780d8071a341aebf08aadf80977912.jpg"><br><br>  If you unscrew the five screws from the bottom, then the upper part is separated together with the matrix: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f9f/90c/c48/f9f90cc4873049ee9ab45e520c2e4e12.jpg"><br><br>  Inside, everything is so nostalgic-analog - a power supply with a transformer, and a receiver with a mechanical KPI!  Strange, I thought that now there are digital radio modules everywhere ... <br><br>  Now about the shortcomings.  Very bright non-switchable backlight night hours.  It is adjustable, but even at a lower level of brightness it illuminates the room like a night light.  It does not bother me, but my wife does not like it. <br><br>  Quite a complicated interface for setting functions.  The device is full of buttons and switches, but there are no instructions in the kit, just download PDF from the site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0c9/e98/006/0c9e98006f524b42a9f9d110e0cc7075.jpg"><br><br>  Pulsed dimming of the backlight creates a flicker effect in dim light (in the video here and there is noticeable).  This is not perceived by the eye, but if used as a night light and at the same time read from the screen, some ripples are possible.  But this is quite a rare combination of factors. <br><br>  Findings: <br><br>  In general, a good device.  It looks interesting, the functionality is original, so it is not a shame to give someone.
