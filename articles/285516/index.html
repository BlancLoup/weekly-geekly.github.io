  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Developer Auction: companies trade for the best specialists</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3ab/525/3b4/3ab5253b4e304a5fdfb5558b38df4b8f.png"><br><br>  A couple of days ago, a second developer auction ended on the <a href="http://developerauction.com/">Developer Auction</a> website.  It was even more successful than the first one in September: employers made bets of $ 78 million, and about 200 programmers were ‚Äúbought‚Äù in total. <br><br>  Such a model of employment is very beneficial for prominent programmers, whose level of professionalism is above average.  After all, such specialists are no longer themselves looking for work, but on the contrary - headhunters from different companies hunt them.  And to get the maximum salary / bonuses, the applicant must hold a competition between them.  This is exactly what is happening on the Developer Auction website, where companies bargain, making the most lucrative offers to the candidate. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  On the Developer Auction website, profiles of the best hand-selected developers are posted.  The selection criteria are quite versatile: earlier on the site it was stated that programmers should be either known in their field, or worked at Google, Zynga, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, Yelp or Square, or finished at Stanford / MIT.  But if a programmer has an outstanding profile on Github and even no education or work experience, then he will also be accepted for auction.  It is beneficial for creators of the Developer Auction site to accept and employ as many applicants as possible, so they are not particularly strict in choosing.  In the latest edition of the <a href="http://developerauction.com/for_developers">FAQ</a> even removed the criteria for the selection of candidates.  But nevertheless, the organizers strive to observe the quality of the ‚Äúgoods‚Äù and they may reject your profile if they deem it necessary.

      The candidate is not obliged to accept the most advantageous offer according to the results of the auction; he may accept any other or not accept anything at all.  Naturally, his profile is not publicly displayed, but is sent only to potential employers confidentially, so your current employer will not know anything. <br><br>  True, the applicant himself does not receive any guarantees on the basis of the auction, because he is still waiting for an interview in the company. <br><br>  Developer Auction acts as a recruitment agency and receives a percentage of each transaction.  Unlike regular recruitment agencies, they share the remuneration with candidates.  If you accept the offer of the employer, the Developer Auction will immediately send you a check in the amount of $ 3,000 to $ 6,000, returning 20% ‚Äã‚Äãof your remuneration. <br><br>  At the first auction in September, questionnaires were taken only from candidates who are willing to work in the San Francisco area, but now the Developer Auction has expanded its field of activity to New York, Los Angeles and Boston. <br><br>  In general, a Developer Auction is an interesting new employment model that allows developers to most accurately estimate their value in the labor market. <br><br>  via <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/26/developer-auction-racks-up-78-million-more-bids-expands-to-la/">TechCrunch 1</a> , <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/06/quora-airbnb-others-made-30m-in-job-offers-to-engineers-in-first-2-weeks-of-developerauction/">TechCrunch 2</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285516/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285516/</a></p>
