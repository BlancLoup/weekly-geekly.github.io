Recently, our companies are mastering the production of car radar detectors and today we will introduce you to one of our new products - the compact radar detector <b>Mio MiRaD 860</b> : <br><br> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/mio/blog/251070/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d66/bca/6c8/d66bca6c862a440cb03e5d8029b3c30c.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  All Mio products are sold in black and orange boxes and the MiRaD 860 is no exception.  The radar detector itself is mounted inside the porous filler, under it is a short instruction, a special mount on a sticky basis, a USB wire and a car power adapter.  The adapter has a power button, and the wire itself is quite long and flexible ‚Äî useful properties if you decide to make a hidden cable routing.  At the end - an L-shaped plug, which practically do not have to ‚Äúaim‚Äù at the connector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/780/13c/6a2/78013c6a2fe54daf8e6f2d8637028d8f.jpg">

Some manufacturers use for this purpose all kinds of "sticky rugs", which are quickly covered with a layer of dust;  In Mio, there is a special washer on a sticky basis (3M tape), inside which there is a magnet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7fd/f24/12c/7fdf2412c7f743b0905fa83402eeba9b.jpg"><br><br>  We glue the puck to a convenient place on the dashboard and then simply radar-detector to it: we just have to bring it up, as it immediately reliably magnetizes. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#f4701d">Appearance</font> </h2><br>  During installation, it is important not to confuse the front of the device with the back :) This is fairly easy to do, since the front and rear of the device looks almost the same.  Behind the tinted plastic panels on the one hand is the main receiver of the signal from the radar, on the other hand - the information display: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/978/e83/3f2/978e833f24f54627b2dab5e7e733a387.jpg"><br><br>  On the sides, there is only a miniUSB port (for updating the database or firmware via a computer) and a jack for powering the car (DC 12-24V).  Quite deserted, but in general it is not a type of device on which there should not be an empty space from any buttons and ports. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/90d/6e6/0ff/90d6e60ff15d406c87cf8e0c82574ee0.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, there are already 4 buttons here - they are located in the upper part of the device (if the radar detector lies horizontally on the car dashboard) and perform the following functions: <br><br>  <b>SET</b> - allows you to enter the main menu of the device or switches the indicators (time, battery voltage and load mode); <br>  <b>MOD</b> - select alert mode; <br>  <b>UP</b> and <b>DN</b> - increase and decrease the sound volume and change the sensitivity mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff9/a85/d43/ff9a85d4364848e684633ad0a11782fc.jpg"><br><br>  The buttons are quite large - if you have to press them on the go, you will not miss. <br><br>  On the reverse side of the radar detector are the speaker holes, as well as a special metal platform, thanks to which the device is attached to the auto panel on a magnetic base.  The radar detector is not a DVR and superstabilization is useless here, however, the magnetic mount fixes the device quite strongly and there are no bobbing or rattling during the ride. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a29/bf7/2a6/a29bf72a60214843b4dc7de59a68cf6e.jpg"><br><br>  As the main material of the body is used soft-touch plastic-type soft-touch with decorative gray inserts.  Here, perhaps, all that you can tell about the appearance of the device :) <br><br><h2>  <font color="#f4701d">Functional features</font> </h2><br>  Mio MiRaD 860 belongs to the class of radar detectors with GPS-receiver.  That is, like many modern radar detectors, it uses two sources in its work to give warning signals: <br><br>  - hardware through the receiver radar detector <br>  - database of GPS-coordinates of cameras <br><br>  The hardware detector is capable of detecting almost all types of stationary and mobile radars that are used in Russia - in the K, Ka, Ku and X ranges (including such systems as the Strelka ST 01, Strelka M, Robot and others).  Subject to the device and such radars that do not emit a signal, for example, "Avtodoria" - a system for measuring the average speed of a vehicle between two complexes installed on the track.  As it is easy to guess, this is done at the expense of the object database (to which the coordinates of the stationary arrows are also recorded for reliability; self-recording is possible (the device allows up to 360,000 points to the database); the database is updated quite often), processing which, the radar -the detector makes alert sounds.  This approach is also good in that it allows the driver to be notified about the danger even in the case when radio signal detection is impossible - for example, on a turning arc with a large number of obstacles (trees, houses).  For the processing of all data meets the new processor MACOM. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/abf/5aa/89a/abf5aa89a8404b94b924fa830d8e7d1c.jpg"><br><br>  Each manufacturer of radar detectors reports a small number of false positives, but the MiRaD 860 has really few of them.  In the presence of 4 modes of sensitivity of the detector: low, medium, high and high;  The first two modes are optimal for the city, but the last two are most suitable for the highway, where the amount of interference is minimal, and maximum sensitivity allows you to ‚Äúsmell‚Äù the radar even at a very long distance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/037/a2e/520/037a2e520dff47c9a568e1f11d9f7280.jpg"><br><br>  One of the device's chips is patented Smart Alert technology.  It lies in the fact that the radar detector will notify in advance about the radar, depending on the speed: if you drive 40-60 km / h, the notification will be 350 meters, and if 100-120 km / h - per kilometer.  This approach allows you to make a reduction in speed more smoothly, without intensive braking. <br><br>  Also, the device has several warning modes.  The ‚ÄúSafe ride‚Äù mode (default) reports cameras without specifying the speed limit.  In other modes, you can activate all other warnings - about speeding, approaching cameras, speed limits on the road section, etc.  As they say, as you wish. <br><br>  The cost of the device at the time of publication of the review is in the range from 4700 to 5200 rubles. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#f4701d">Instead of output</font> </h2><br>  <b>The Mio MiRaD 860</b> is a reliable compact companion that will often help you out on the roads and help you avoid an increase in expenses with fines.  Everything written above is also true for the <b><a href="http://www.mio.com/ru/products-speed-camera-detector-MiRaD-865-overview.htm">Mio MiRAD 865</a></b> radar detector, which appeared in the middle of spring: this model differs only in the way of mounting - the vacuum sucker, usual for everyone, on the glass (or rather, the module with three small suckers) instead of the magnetic lock. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c3c/89c/46e/c3c89c46e67c452382755cbe6c26eb0d.jpg"><br><br>  Well, if, in addition to the radar detector, you still want the DVR, but do not want to block your view, we advise you to pay attention to our ‚Äúfood processor‚Äù called <b><a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/mio/blog/249358/">Mio MiVue 588</a></b> - the older model FullHD-DVR with built-in hazard notification function ( due to the base of GPS-coordinates). <br><br>  Do you need a radar detector?  And if so, then as a separate device, or does the symbiosis of two devices work?  If you drive without speed violations and just honor traffic rules, then respect you and respect! <br><br>  We are waiting for your questions in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365579/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365579/</a></p>
