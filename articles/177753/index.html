Mission for the company</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Quite often, the question of writing a company's mission arises when the discussion of the site structure begins, or rather, about the us section.  History, structure, employees, mission ... And what is it all about and what for? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Mission identification </h5><br>  In a good way, the mission is part of the company's positioning strategy.  Which, as we know, is most often absent at the start.  Because starting his own business with himself and a couple of diggers, the entrepreneur thinks not about philosophy, values ‚Äã‚Äãand other beautiful, but extremely ephemeral things, but about the most pressing tasks: where to get the dough, to find dudes who are ready to work for the future prospects, like Do not burn out and quickly and permanently destroy the arising jambs. <br><br>  Nevertheless, if you properly shake the owner so that he starts to move his brains in this direction, in the most miraculous way it turns out that he has everything: the brand philosophy, values, and mission.  At least at the level of vague mystical sensations, on the basis of which he regularly makes certain decisions (for example, which of you does not work with rollbacks in principle?).  You just need to ask the right questions - and formulate. <br><br><h5>  And if more specifically? </h5><br>  To formulate a mission you need to ask yourself a flurry of trivial, at first glance, and very useful questions on closer examination.

      For example.  That's all you do ‚Äî what is it for?  What principles do you follow when doing business?  Increase quality or reduce the cost?  Make the service and product available to the maximum number of people or serve a handful of favorites in full?  Offer unified solutions or piece goods, amazing imagination?  For whom is the existence of your company and all that it produces important?  For customers, employees, partners?  Who is more important to you, what do you do for them and what do you want to do?  What global goals do you set for yourself?  How does what you do affect people's lives?  What, ideally, positive changes will bring the world your business?  And, specifically, your target audience? <br><br>  <b>What happens if you answer these questions:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aa4/0c8/d03/aa40c8d037527cdbf6874e048fda3ece.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>‚ÄúWe are confident that with the help of technology development and innovation we will find answers to the challenges of tomorrow.</i>  <i>Technology creates opportunities: for business growth, for the involvement of citizens, developing countries in the digital economy, and finally, for the growth of each person.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Our goal is to develop innovative technologies and efficient processes that create new markets, make people's lives better and continue to strengthen Samsung's position as a market leader. ‚Äù</i> <i><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/686/8d8/c5a/6868d8c5adecd977ed5418bca891afa1.jpg" alt="image"><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúFacebook was not originally created as a company.</i>  <i>It was made to achieve a social goal - to make the world more open and to strengthen the ties between people.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Facebook is committed to creating services that enable people to share everything they consider necessary to share with each other, and in turn help them transform many institutions and industries ‚Äù- Mark Zuckerberg</i> <i><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c65/3ba/42d/c653ba42deb497df8adac1282a0f92bc.jpg" alt="image"><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúWe will supply the most beautiful and popular casual clothing in the world to the market.</i>  <i>We will dress the whole world "- Levi's</i> <i><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/182/92b/d58/18292bd58d4f972fc50aedceba847044.jpg" alt="image"><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúThe mission of Aeroflot is to help passengers realize their life plans and dreams - to work efficiently, have a good time relaxing, meet family and friends, and discover new countries and cities.‚Äù</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>And from personal copywriting experience: ‚ÄúYes, we want the grandmother in the ticket for heat to see the number a couple of zeros below!‚Äù (Manufacturer of heat exchangers).</i> <br><br><h5>  Is it really necessary? </h5><br>  A small construction team that finds customers ‚Äúan acquaintance‚Äù is like a fish umbrella.  A small IT company?  Or a fashionable startup?  Large network company? <br><br><blockquote>  Do not waste your time developing the mission of the company if it is not in your company yet.  This is a loss of both time and money.  99% of the company's employees will not remember it.  The company's mission has virtually no influence on your customers and partners.  This is fashion.  She will pass " </blockquote><br>  So authoritatively claimed by the authoritative ‚Äúmarketer‚Äù Igor Mann in ‚ÄúMarketing 100%.  Remix.  And then I changed my mind, spent several master classes on writing a ‚Äúwow mission‚Äù and began to clarify in other sources that the mission does not need only 90% of companies.  And if we agree with this, the question immediately arises: who are these notorious 10%, who can‚Äôt do without a mission? <br><br><h5>  It‚Äôs time to take on Claudia and start thinking about a mission if: </h5><br>  <b>Besides her, you have nothing to tell about yourself.</b> <br>  And you do not want to become the author of the next masterpiece from the series: "a young dynamic company ...".  And you need to tell about yourself: customers, partners, investors and a crowd of other important people.  In such cases, the choice is not great: either honestly and interestingly about the mission, values, competitive advantages of cooperation and the scheme of interaction of cooperation - or be silent as partisans. <br><br>  <b>Want to scale up</b> <br>  ‚ÄúAll major brands have a mission, and if we have it, we will also look cool‚Äù - this is our rational grain.  Solid design, calm pathos text, high-quality photos and a beautifully listed list of goals - works the same. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6b1/558/d23/6b1558d239f3ac9261dcdb5cfe2276eb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Mission is one of your competitive advantages.</b> <br>  Social responsibility is not just a beautiful flag, which you are waving, but a real position and you want to declare it openly, and what is there to hide - to play.  Care for the environment?  Why be silent: say, write, show how you do it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d3d/38d/9d4/d3d38d9d497e01ba61be26a9e96bd9ac.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>You are a startup</b> <br>  Guess why? <br><br><h5>  Someone brings good and justice to the world, and I stupidly carry a bag of dough </h5><br>  Let's immediately discuss everything against: <br><br>  <b>Mission is dust to customers</b> <br>  From this point of view, any advertisement is brainwashing.  Only one works, and the other does not.  Missions are the same story. <br><br>  <b>Mission is a staff zombie method.</b> <br>  Alas, the people around them are not such idiots as we sometimes would like.  And the staff is no exception.  If people sincerely love the brand in which they work, sincerely share its values ‚Äã‚Äãand call their friends' colleagues, there is nothing wrong with that.  Study carefully the Mcdonalds corporate environment, talk to one of the network marketing agents.  Yes, they have an unhealthy shine in their eyes.  Yes, it looks a little scary.  But it makes the company profit and makes these people happy.  Why not? <br><br>  <b>Mission always lies because it idealizes</b> <br>  Do not want to lie - be honest.  Who hinders?  The brave, by the way, conquer the sea.  Let us recall a person widely known in narrow circles: ‚Äúwithout garbage‚Äù is also a mission. <br><br><h5>  How to invent a mission out of the blue </h5><br><br>  If you really want to come up with a beautiful mission, but the only reason for the existence of your company is the desire to make a profit, then you are too lazy to think.  And do not worry, everyone has come up with a crowd of philosophers, sociologists, economists, and just people who love to work the brain.  Take, customize and use: <br><br>  <b>Principles that suit everyone:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e33/0a5/6d7/e330a56d7a4fe0154490cad07efcf123.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  No good dentist need a mission </h5><br>  When you open the site of the next large Russian holding and see a sheet of pompous phrases, you start to choke not with delight. <br><br>  Well, don't do that.  After all, the tablets on which the covenant is stamped ‚Äúthe mission of the company must be so boring that everyone reading it teeth will be reduced‚Äù does not exist. <br><br>  Be ironic, original and sincere.  A brother-in-law sees from afar: it will only attract your customers. <br><br><h5>  Worth looking at :: missions of famous companies </h5><br>  <b>Starbucks</b> <a href="http://starbuckscoffee.ru/ru/_About%2BStarbucks/Mission%2BStatement.htm">starbuckscoffee.ru/ru/_About+Starbucks/Mission+Statement.htm</a> <br>  <b>Mcdonalds</b> <a href="http://www.aboutmcdonalds.com/mcd/our_company/mission_and_values.html">www.aboutmcdonalds.com/mcd/our_company/mission_and_values.html</a> <br>  <b>Google</b> <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/ru/about/company/">www.google.com/intl/ru/about/company</a> <br>  <b>Whether to cry, or laugh: Lukoil</b> <a href="http://www.lukoil.ru/static_6_5id_2106_.html">www.lukoil.ru/static_6_5id_2106_.html</a> <br><br>  And finally face palm: <br>  ‚ÄúSharing responsibility before God, with one‚Äôs own conscience, past, present, and future generations ‚Äî spreading one‚Äôs own example of righteousness, peace, and joy in business activities, in relations between people within and outside the company, on the world market.‚Äù  Valenta Mobile </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/177753/">https://habr.com/ru/post/177753/</a></p>
