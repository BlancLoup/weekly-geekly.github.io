Well, or at least support the supporters.  Here is <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/">The Daily WTF</a> , for example.  The main page is covered with a white rectangle with the following text: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><blockquote><h4>  Support The Daily WTF in support of the SOPA movement. </h4><br><br>  Now is January 18, 2012, and, although most of the Internet has decided to blacken [blackout - in the sense of ‚Äúclosing‚Äù] its sites in protest against the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), we took the opposite position and whitened [white-out] Daily WTF in support of supporting SOPA.

      If there is something that both SOPA advocates, such as myself, and his opponents may agree with, PROTECT-IP and Stop Online Piracy Act have little to do with protecting intellectual property and stopping Internet piracy. <br><br>  In the end, those who decide to <a href="http://www.solidarity-us.org/node/1326">steal the result of creative work, such as the ‚ÄúI have a dream‚Äù speech,</a> written by author Martin Luther King Jr., can already be sued and prosecuted in accordance with current US copyright laws.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/patent/136260/">Intellectual property thieves living abroad may already be extradited</a> to appear before our fair federal court.  And the <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/130763-homeland-security-dept-seizes-domain-names-">Department of Homeland Security can already arbitrarily withdraw domain names</a> that conform to its arbitrary standard of violation of the national something-there. <br><br>  Although these laws make such actions more illegal (and, therefore, reduce their number), they do something much more important: they help destroy the DNS and the Internet, as we know it.  And this is exactly what we strongly support. <br><br>  You see, before, if you wanted to go online and access information stored there, such as digitized photos, electronic bulletin boards (BBS), informational data banks, you only needed to know one thing: a phone number.  You just ran your favorite communication program (I preferred Telix), he dialed this phone number, and, after a refreshing symphony of beeps and whistles, you were on the Internet. <br><br>  Each phone number sent you to a wonderful peaceful community that was almost completely self-sufficient.  There were no ‚Äúhyperlinks‚Äù between the systems: you simply wrote down the phone number, disconnected from this system, and then dialed the new number.  And let me say, little in life could be compared with the absolute delight of opening a new issue and a new electronic resource. <br><br>  And then this Information Superhighway came - and its tightly integrated Domain Name System (DNS) - exterminating these peaceful, independent communities.  BBS-ki past were milled and mixed in a giant "dot-com" machine, leaving us with an interconnected web of domain names.  You do not ‚Äúgo online‚Äù - you are already online - and if you want to access an electronic resource, you can use a ‚Äúdomain name‚Äù such as TheDailyWTF.com. <br><br>  Domain names are a rather confusing concept, as they not only describe what an electronic resource is, but also where it is located.  Nothing else in the world works that way for obvious reasons.  Can you imagine how this would complicate ordinary, everyday things, like getting a phone number?  How is it, "Jenny eighty-six point com" or "Jenny eighty-six point none"?  It would be total chaos. <br><br>  SOPA and PROTECT-IP give hope for a return to the golden age of telecommunications, to the days when the Information Super Highway has not yet infected the online culture with all this nonsense with domain names.  Let DNS die a natural death and get ready for the return of the Internet Protocol Number (IPN).  All you need to do is get a notebook, in which the names of electronic resources and their corresponding IPN are written.  And let the first entry in it be <br><br>  Daily WTF 74.50.110.120 <br><br>  We can only hope that our legislators, following common sense, will also prohibit HTTP (and HTML / JavaScript), and we can all return to a more reasonable GOPHER standard. <br></blockquote><br><br>  Translator's note: trolling is good, good.  But in my opinion too thin.  I almost missed the text without reading, taking the title seriously. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136534/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136534/</a></p>
