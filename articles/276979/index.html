  <section class="page js-page"><h1>PRIMEFLEX vShape - turnkey solution for the implementation of virtualization</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, many companies plan to transfer their core business applications to a virtual environment, so they need to build a server platform that provides high-performance and reliable operation of virtual machines.  When choosing servers, storage systems and switches for implementing virtualization, companies often try to save on equipment costs and buy the cheapest products, and then charge their IT specialists with building a hardware platform on which to install the VMware hypervisor or Microsoft Hyper-V.  Although this ‚Äúdo-it-yourself‚Äù approach at first glance minimizes the costs of implementing virtualization, in fact there are several ‚Äúpitfalls‚Äù that can significantly increase the cost and timing of such projects.  In this article we will talk about the integrated system <a href="http://www.fujitsu.com/ru/products/computing/integrated-systems/vshape.html"><b>Fujitsu PRIMEFLEX vShape</b></a> , designed for the fastest and most reliable implementation of virtualization in the enterprise. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/208/f3a/ce4/208f3ace41f1415289858efcb9e081e0.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of all, the selection of the cheapest servers does not always guarantee the cost savings on the purchase of equipment.  The use of servers with the most high-performance models of processors and memory modules allows you to get the same power level as when using a larger number of relatively cheap servers.  Therefore, saving on the price of a single server results in a higher cost of the entire server complex, as well as increased costs for its power and cooling.  For example, if business applications in a virtual environment require at least 100 processor cores, then using dual-socket servers with a 6-core Intel Xeon E5-2620 v3 processor will require nine physical servers, and using newer servers with more expensive 18-core Xeon E5-2699 v3 - only three.  In addition, reducing the number of physical servers saves the space occupied by the server complex in the rack, and reduces the number of switches and ports needed to combine these servers and disk arrays into a single system.  Also, this configuration is easier to manage and requires less power input, therefore, saves on bespereboynik. <br><br>  The second typical problem when building a hardware platform for virtualization on your own is design errors, because of which you often cannot obtain the level of performance required for effective business applications and you need to urgently find a budget for purchasing additional servers.  Or it turns out that part of the capacity of the built server complex is idling, and this means that the implementation project of virtualization could be done at lower cost. <br><br>  Finally, despite the use of standard server hardware when self-deploying virtualization, there is always the risk of incompatibility between individual hardware components and software for building virtual environments.

      However, all these problems can be avoided when introducing virtualization using the integrated system PRIMEFLEX vShape, which Fujitsu has been producing since 2012.  The current third generation of vShape consists of the following main components combined into a single complex: <br><br><ul><li>  PRIMERGY RX2450 M1 dvuhsoketny rack server </li><li>  Shared for all servers disk system <a href="http://www.fujitsu.com/ru/products/computing/storage/disk/eternus-dx/dx100/index.html">ETERNUS DX100 S3</a> </li><li>  One or two Brocade switches through which IP SAN or FC SAN servers connect to the disk array </li></ul><br>  PRIMEFLEX vShape comes in several Fujitsu certified reference architecture configurations, in which the number of servers, their RAM, and the capacity of the disk array are designed to service a certain number of virtual machines.  A standard virtual machine receives one virtual processor 1 GHz, 3 GB RAM and 100 GB disk capacity.  The basic parameters of the reference architectures are presented in the table below (in redundancy configurations (HA), redundancy of switches is used to protect against failures). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/642/f84/247/642f842472644b2baebceabfd68474e8.jpg"><habracut><br><br>  PRIMEFLEX vShape can use VMware and Microsoft hypervisors.  In the first version, VMware Essentials Plus is delivered with the solution, in the second version, Windows Server 2012 R2 together with Hyper-V Manager and Cluster Manager. <br><br>  VMware vSphere Desktop Edition with Horizon or VMware Essentials Plus is included with vShape VDI, and vSphere STD with vCenter Standard when using Citrix XenDesktop. <br><br>  The use of PRIMEFLEX vShape reference architectures not only eliminates the risks that are inevitable when introducing virtualization on your own, but also saves the customer time, which, with the traditional do-it-yourself approach, goes into developing a virtualization server platform, building it and testing it.  The customer receives from Fujitsu a fully operational hardware complex along with a pre-installed and fully configured hypervisor and, as a result, can transfer its applications to the virtual environment much faster. <br><br>  The main areas of application of PRIMEFLEX vShape are the implementation of vSphere / Hyper-V server virtualization, the deployment of virtual desktop infrastructure (vShape configuration for VDI), and the construction of a private cloud.  To expand the capabilities of the solution, several options are offered: <br><br><ul><li>  Scale performance for up to 2,400 virtual machines or 2,000 virtual desktops </li><li>  Expansion of disk array capacity </li><li>  Integration with the backup console <a href="http://www.fujitsu.com/ru/products/computing/storage/data-protection/cs200c/">ETERNUS CS200c S2</a> </li><li>  Disaster Resilience Option </li><li>  Delivery with pre-installed software and customer applications </li></ul><br>  Fujitsu PRIMEFLEX vShape allows the customer to quickly and with minimal risk to build a virtual infrastructure with an optimal level of performance and fault tolerance for its needs. </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/276979/">https://habr.com/ru/post/276979/</a></p>
