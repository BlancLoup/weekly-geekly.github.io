I am the announcer Chumak and I help people achieve more with the help of a tool that is always with you - the ability to speak. <br><br>  Some of you were at my training on public speaking before the HighLoad ++ conference, some were not, but that's not a big deal.  We will arrange it right here on the pages of Habr.  In subsequent publications, I will analyze speeches with HighLoad ++ in the context of oratorical skill. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bc/ua/ci/bcuacicohcd62pf7duplzfkszeu.jpeg">

      I will not touch on the substantive part, you obviously understand it better than me.  I will mark the good points of the speeches and the ‚Äúpoints of growth‚Äù - the problem areas, having corrected that, the author of the report can become a more effective speaker. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Surely you have seen people go out from the audience during your presentation.  Someone was important to answer the call.  Someone realized that the topic was not his, and went to another report or drink coffee.  And someone was interested in the topic, but you were not interested as a speaker.  Sad right?  I know these feelings, I had it myself.  But do not take everything personally.  It's okay  Go! <br><br><h2>  Why do we go on stage? </h2><br>  The main thing that the speaker should always remember is that we go on stage to give something to the audience.  Do not get.  Give away.  To bring some benefit.  If there is no use, you can not go out.  But this case is not about us. <br><br>  So the main question is: ‚ÄúHow can I make it so that what I want to convey to the audience really reaches it?‚Äù And this question is not because they don‚Äôt understand.  They understand.  But they may perceive something in their own way.  Give your own interpretation.  Something may not understand at all.  Because I, as a speaker, explained this incomprehensibly.  Did not take care to make this clear.  This is the key: to be clear, to speak in the language of the audience and in its world.  This is what I call care. <br><br><h2>  Oratorical skill is a concern for your audience. </h2><br>  And it is through this filter that we will consider speeches.  But the manifestation of this care and respect is expressed in different things: careful preparation, speech structuring, rehearsals both in front of colleagues in the office, and right in the place where you are to perform.  And now it's not just about the content part, in which you yourself have been pumped.  Look at the chart.  It shows how the audience perceives what is happening on the stage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1e6/3b0/bc0/1e63b0bc08a2dd88e80a0d4fd5433aaa.png"><br><br>  We are so arranged.  And either we understand and use it to be more effective, or not.  This is another tool.  <b>Same as code optimization.</b>  The application will still work.  The only question is how much resources it will occupy.  How many resources will you, as a speaker, spend on engaging the audience in the process? <br><br>  The audience at the conference a priori came to the content, and it is interesting to her.  But how much we, the audience, being in comfortable chairs, will spend our strength to understand what is at stake?  Will we hardly listen attentively and constantly ask ourselves: ‚ÄúWhat did he say there now?  Maybe go to another report? ‚Äù, Or with interest to delve into what is happening, without having any desire to leave the hall? <br><br>  Here is a simple example. <br><br>  Imagine that we have two identical candies in sterile conditions.  One of them is in a bright and attractive wrapper, and the second is not.  Which one are we likely to buy?  Most likely the one in the wrapper.  Why?  Because we buy candy, and we buy it on a wrapper.  Although the wrapper unfolds and is immediately discarded as soon as we get to the candy itself. <br><br>  Equally the same thing happens in the performance.  No matter how valuable and useful the information is, it will not linger in the head if it is not properly packed. <br><br>  Let's take a look at how we perceive the information that comes to us. <br>  We divide the entire array of data that we receive about each other into ‚ÄúWHAT‚Äù and ‚ÄúHOW‚Äù. <br>  The content of your report, the thoughts, the benefits that you want to talk about - this is 5% of the total performance.  This is what you say.  Thought forms, mental images.  And what you want the audience to perceive. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAnd playing with us is [name] from the city [cityname].  Attention, the question: ‚ÄúDoes this mean that HOW TO SPEAK is more important than WHAT TO SPEAK?  The minute has gone. " <br><br>  Not.  This means that in order for these most valuable 5% to remain in the heads of people, it is necessary to take care of the remaining 80% - how people perceive you. <br>  You yourself are capable of giving rise to different interpretations in the minds of the audience. <br><br>  Yes, you yourself are capable of giving rise to different interpretations of yourself and your speech in the minds of the audience.  And it is in your interest that these interpretations work for you and help you communicate the thought. <br><br>  This is by no means a hoax, as you might think at once.  Not.  It's about being the best version of yourself. <br><br>  In the following publications I will comment on the performances on several parameters relating to different channels of information perception: visual (what we see) and auditory (what we hear).  Here they are: <br><br>  Visual: <br><br><ol><li>  Facial expression </li><li>  Pose </li><li>  Gesturing </li><li>  Moving around the scene, the distance between you and the viewer </li><li>  Eye contact with the hall </li></ol><br>  Audio: <br><br><ol><li>  Intonation </li><li>  Pitch (Frequency) </li><li>  Intonation </li><li>  Timbre </li><li>  Pace </li><li>  Volume </li><li>  Diction </li><li>  Pauses </li><li>  Parasite words </li></ol><br>  All of these are equally important factors that every speaker needs to follow.  By controlling them, you care about your listeners and that the information you have prepared is perceived more easily. <br><br>  And yes.  Even in the most disastrous performance you can always find good moments.  As well as in the best - points of growth. <br><br>  I will select the reports in random order.  If you want to be among the first or vice versa - against parsing your report, let me know.  You can contact me through Habr or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Speakerchumak">Facebook</a> .  The main goal of the entire series of publications is to give an objective view from the outside to make the next conference even better with your help. <br><br><hr><br>  Friends, we want to immediately give an announcement of our May conference RIT ++.  On it, Dmitry Chumak will hold a training and help you in preparing speeches.  For speakers, as before, it will be at our expense.  12 streams are expected at the festival, and we invite pros to share their unique experiences and tell colleagues interesting case studies from practice.  Applications for performances can be left <a href="http://speakers.ritfest.ru/">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/345698/">https://habr.com/ru/post/345698/</a></p>
