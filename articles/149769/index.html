  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Satellite vehicle monitoring system "AutoTracker"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the dawn of the development of the satellite navigation market, the company Russian Navigation Technologies was established, the main product of which was the satellite vehicle monitoring system called AutoTracker.  At that time in Russia almost nothing was known about the monitoring of transport.  Everyone understood what a GPS navigator is, that you can determine your location on an electronic map, and understand how to get from your starting point to your destination.  But before the use of navigation systems in fleet management was still very far away.  At the same time, the cellular communications market is rapidly developing, and the cost of GPRS data transmission is rapidly decreasing. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Then the idea emerged that if you locate the car and immediately transfer its coordinates via GPRS, you can constantly control where the car is located in real time.  At that time it was a very urgent task, because  official cars are often traditionally used for non-official purposes.  GPS capabilities (like any satellite navigation system) were not limited to this.  Together with the current location, the speed is also determined, and the set of accumulated navigation data allowed the software to determine the distance traveled, places of stops and stops, speed limits in all areas, to signal the arrival at some place.  And this is only the so-called navigation options.  Developers quickly realized that it was equally important for fleet management to control vehicle performance.  And the same navigation device installed in the car, began to collect information about the work of transport, and first of all about fuel consumption and level. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ccc/b37/b71/cccb37b714e623b0a4d67ea201fd4f21.jpg"><br><br>  At first, only the GPS receiver was used in the equipment for monitoring vehicles, but as the GLONASS system developed, more and more devices began to appear with the support of the Russian navigation system.  Combined GLONASS / GPS onboard terminals are used mainly in state and municipal fleets, and where required by law. <br>  Despite the fact that transport monitoring systems are still a new market, Russian Navigation Technologies has strong positions on it.  Since the beginning of work more than 120 thousand units of transport are equipped with the AutoTracker system.  There are more than 40 well-known brands among customers, including Gazprom, Rosneft, Alrosa, Sibur, TNK-BP, Luklil, Sberbank, Severstal, the Kopeika and Magnit retail chains, Mosmetrostroy, the brewing company Baltika and many others. <br>  The satellite vehicle monitoring system, such as AutoTracker, is a complex hardware and software system, during the development, implementation and operation of which many difficult and interesting situations arise.  Therefore, in a blog, we would like to publish a cycle of materials on how the satellite vehicle monitoring system works, how and what clients' tasks we solve, how we develop products and infrastructure.  I want to pay a lot of attention to technical issues, server and client software, mapping and communication systems. </div>
