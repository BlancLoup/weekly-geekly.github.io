    <blockquote>  TEC pitch night was a turning point for us - we raised $ 250,000 literally at the event, and the remaining investment almost immediately after.  This is all thanks to Anna and Stas *, who taught us to present the startup to investors, introduced us to investors, and moreover, helped us to the very end of raising investments.  If I ever need to raise money again (although I hope I don‚Äôt need it), TEC will be my first step. </blockquote><br>  There is also a large conference that gathers a decent amount of Russian-speaking public, through which it is easier for a startup to ‚Äúenter‚Äù Silicon Valley - <a href="http://siliconnews.ru/svod">SVOD (Silicon Valley Open Doors)</a> - an annual technology investment conference, which is held in partnership with TEC club and AmBAR, and regularly gathers in its The walls of this amazing audience are more than 600 participants - investors, start-ups, entrepreneurs from all over the world, including from the countries of the former Soviet Union.
