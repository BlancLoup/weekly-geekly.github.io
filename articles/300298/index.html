The company decided to use this circumstance, having agreed with several operators. <br><br>  Yesterday, April 20, <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/line/2016-04-20_eset_predstavila_spetsialnuyu_versiyu_eset_nod32">it became</a> known that Eset has released a special version of mobile antivirus Eset NOD32 Mobile Security for the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D1%258B">MTS</a> retail network.  ‚ÄúThe purchase model is adapted to the sales process in the MTS stores.  The seller recommends the antivirus to buyers, after payment the user receives an SMS with the activation data and a link to download the distribution package.  You can also extend the product in the MTS salon, ‚Äùsays Alexey Kosichenko, director of the development department at Eset Russia. <a name="habracut"></a>

      ‚ÄúEset sells licenses for MTS through the official distributor, so in general the sales process does not differ from the principle of the Eset partner network.  In this project there is a share of the experiment, so the mechanisms of mutual settlements can be adjusted depending on the wishes of the operators, ‚Äùhe added. <br><br>  According to Alexei Kosichenko, Eset has been cooperating with mobile operators in Russia for several years. <br><br>  In 2014, the company released a special version of Eset Nod32 Mobile Security for subscribers of PJSC <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D1%258B%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB-%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">VimpelCom</a> (Beeline brand).  ‚ÄúAt that time, it was the only carrier project on anti-virus protection, where one-click purchase and linking to the subscriber‚Äôs mobile account was implemented.  The product was named Mobile Security, today the number of its users is measured in hundreds of thousands, ‚Äùsaid Alexey Kosichenko. <br><br>  According to VimpelCom spokeswoman Anna Aybasheva, the Eset application automatically updates virus databases, allows you to use additional anti-phishing, SMS filter and call functions, perform application auditing and much more. <br><br>  "Moreover, it is pre-installed on all current smartphones and tablets under the Beeline brand, as well as on devices from other manufacturers, as part of exclusive co-branded models," Anna Aybasheva <a href="http://www.comnews.ru/node/100588">told</a> ComNews. <br><br>  Alexey Kosichenko said that Eset also has joint projects with <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25A4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">MegaFon</a> PJSC.  The head of the MegaFon press service, Yulia Dorokhina, added that the operator‚Äôs clients can also protect their mobile device for free with antivirus software from <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE">Kaspersky Lab</a> . <br><br>  ‚Äú <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tele2">Tele2</a> plans to implement an antivirus solution.  Now the company is in talks on cooperation with the leaders of the information security market, ‚ÄùOlga Telekina, a Tele2 spokeswoman, said. <br><br>  The advantages of such an anti-virus solution for subscribers are, as Alexey Kosichenko noted, that they can quickly and easily protect a mobile device.  As for telecom operators, he added, recommending antivirus to subscribers, ultimately they reduce security risks throughout the network. <br><br>  ‚ÄúBy the way, some operators had attempts to develop their own anti-virus solutions, but in the end they came to the conclusion that anti-virus vendors should be involved in protecting subscribers,‚Äù concluded Kosichenko. <br><br>  The trend of ‚Äúintegrated protection‚Äù is also common in the social networking market.  So, Eset Nod32 technology on this model uses <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook">Facebook</a> .  Antivirus modules are also integrated into complex corporate security solutions, notes Alexey Kosichenko. <br><br>  At the end of 2015, the share of sales of Eset antivirus for mobile devices in revenue increased from 5% to 15%.  At the beginning of 2016, Eset products appeared in 6,000 mobile retail outlets.  ‚ÄúIn 2016, a common business with telecom operators will bring Eset from 8 to 10% of revenue.  As the figures show, mobile users and mobile retail have become growth points for software vendors, ‚Äù <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/top/2016-04-18_biznes_eset_v_rossii_po_itogam_2015_gvyros_na">said</a> company representatives to CNews. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe company compensates for the drop in sales in traditional offline retail by several measures, including bringing new solutions for mobile devices to the market and creating a common business with telecom operators,‚Äù Eset said. <br><br>  The head of Eset in Russia and the CIS, Denis Mateev, also explains the company's revenue growth by active work in the corporate segment: ‚ÄúDespite the fact that the economy was experiencing a difficult period, we managed to keep a high level of renewals and grow well in new sales, primarily to large corporate clients .  In addition, its role was played by the growth in sales through online shopping, he said. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300298/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300298/</a></p>
