  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Video Card Repair</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After reading a recent note about the repair of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/127957/">processors</a> , I decided to share the method with which I repaired my video card. <br><br>  Somewhere about a month ago in the course of work, I received artifacts on the screen.  Since the video card is hot GeForce 9800GTX + AMP Edition, and it's summer outside, I was not surprised.  I thought that just a video card in a closed case warmed to the state of artifacts.  I note that because of its overclocking past, which is mainly focused on video cards overclocking, artifacts do not lead to panic.  Turned off the computer, let the gland cool down a little, opened the case cover, the cooler turned it on at full speed, rebooted the computer.  But it was not there, the artifacts met me right from the boot screen.  Then I appreciated the scale of the tragedy.  Such problems are usually not treated and it is easier to buy a new video card. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I had to switch to an integrated video card and started to prepare for the purchase of a new video card.  For the right choice looked at the forum overclocker.ru.  Once there, I decided to ask the community if there are ways to cure such problems and I was not mistaken - there were <a href="http://forums.overclockers.ru/viewtopic.php%3Ff%3D3%26t%3D334265">ways</a> . <br><br>  Everything turned out to be quite interesting.  ‚ÄúHot‚Äù video cards tend to produce artifacts after some time.  The fact is that in the process of work they can warm up to a temperature at which the solder softens, the contacts gradually recede and as a result at some point the contact disappears completely - artifacts appear.  Contacts disappear either on the GPU or on the memory chips.  I apologize for such an explanation on the fingers.

      What is the repair with such problems?  The point is the same heat and return the contact in place.  So how to find out what kind of contact went problematic, we decided to heat all the contacts.  This is done either in the oven or with a building dryer, and the video card is positioned so that the chips under the weight are ‚Äúcrushed‚Äù. <br><br>  The first thought was that it would not work.  And then I thought, anyway, the video card is in a landfill.  He took off the cooling system, peeled off all the stickers, tried to remove everything that was possible.  Then to the kitchen.  In order to save everything that may suffer from heating, we wrap the entire board with foil, except for memory and GPU chips, and leave ‚Äúunscrewed‚Äù and place under the chips on the back of the board.  He put a card in the oven and began to heat, detecting the time during which the card was heated at a certain temperature.  The temperature was determined exclusively using the oven temperature controller.  So: <br><ul><li>  I set 50 degrees, wait for heating and keep it at this temperature for 2 minutes </li><li>  I expose 100 degrees, I wait for heating and 4 minutes I hold at this temperature </li><li>  I set 150 degrees, wait for heating and keep it at this temperature for 4 minutes </li><li>  I set 200 degrees, wait for heating and keep it at this temperature for 2 minutes </li><li>  I set 220 degrees, wait for heating and keep it at this temperature for 5 minutes </li></ul><br>  Upon completion, the procedure turned off the heat and waited for the temperature to drop.  I did not immediately remove the card and did not touch it, so that the elements would ‚Äúfloat‚Äù on the melted solder and it would not get worse.  In order to speed up the cooling procedure a little, I slightly opened the oven door.  As a result, the card cooled for about 50-60 minutes, after which I took it out and gave another 15 minutes to ‚Äúdry up‚Äù at room temperature.  I collected the video card and inserted it into the computer.  Honestly, I didn‚Äôt really believe in the success of such a repair, but the video card was successfully launched without artifacts and has been working properly for two weeks already. <br><br>  I think many have similar video cards that I‚Äôm not working like, but I‚Äôm sorry to throw it out.  At your own risk, you can try this repair: either get a working device or finally decide to throw out the video card.  Reading the messages on the thematic forum, I came to the conclusion that the percentage of successful ‚Äúbaked goods‚Äù is 70-80%.  So the success rate is quite high. <br><br>  PS I apologize for not providing the post with photographs - when I was engaged in this procedure, I did not take a photo shoot. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128300/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128300/</a></p>
