Nevertheless, although it was not easy, we managed - the coordination system of observers successfully worked during the pre-election stage and directly during the elections, having fulfilled the tasks assigned to it. <br>  Of course, there were overlays, the biggest one - almost an hour downtime of the call center call recording interface on election day, provoked by a large DDoS attack on the FBK ‚Äúneighboring‚Äù projects (our mistake could have been better prepared), but on the whole it did not affect the results. <br><br>  After the elections, for obvious reasons, the development actually stopped, and the project was slowly prepared for the opening of the code.  In my free time I will work on it, but one will not go far, and therefore, of course, we need the hands and heads of those who are willing to donate a little time for the development of the system.  The fact that she will be needed, no doubt, is the first big election, where such a scale of coordination of observers is needed - the elections to the Moscow City Duma, which are just around the corner.

      So, the project repository - <a href="https://github.com/fbkinfo/rosvybory">github.com/fbkinfo/rosvybory</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If you are not ready to take and begin to write code, but there are some constructive suggestions or criticism, then, of course, do not hesitate, either here or immediately to issues on the github.  A whole bunch of great engineers worked on the project, but with different experiences and in very hellish conditions, so the project can be refined a lot, and the specifics would help a lot and I, as maintainer, and probably other developers who will help. <br><br>  You can try the current version in action on the demo version, see <a href="https://github.com/fbkinfo/rosvybory/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE-%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580">github.com/fbkinfo/rosvybory/wiki/Democ server</a> . <br>  The main task now is the revision in accordance with the <a href="http://fbkinfo.github.io/rosvybory/">existing formulation</a> . <br>  More specific tasks and fixed bugs - <a href="https://github.com/fbkinfo/rosvybory/issues">github.com/fbkinfo/rosvybory/issues</a> (I still have to figure out how to properly arrange them, we used another tracker during development). <br>  Taking into account that the project will be needed further, it is also necessary to cover with tests - now there are quite a few of them - and refactoring to the best of our ability and desire ‚Äî many things were written for speed. <br><br>  At the moment, it seems that there are not very many very important tasks, but I‚Äôm sure that the guys from RosVyborov themselves and other observational organizations will also throw feedback and ideas that, as they become available, will be published in the issues. <br><br>  I have no experience with the content of the public repository, so the advice and criticism on the organization of this process is also welcome. <br><br>  Join now!  As they say, RosVybory will not write themselves. :) <br><br>  PS <br>  Come to the meeting of IT professionals tomorrow everyone who wants to help the Fund for the fight against corruption.  Let's get acquainted, talk about projects and plans for the future.  October 9, Wednesday at 19:30, Taganskaya Street, Building 29. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/443888772399542">www.facebook.com/events/443888772399542</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/196848/">https://habr.com/ru/post/196848/</a></p>
