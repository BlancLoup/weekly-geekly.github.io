      We introduced ourselves, talked a little about our previous experience.  A guy of my age, according to him, a freelancer with experience.  Appears even on one foreign site in the column "Top Rated" with more than three hundred positive reviews.  I told you that I have been programming in php for 5 years, I also have some experience, I have shown.  Those.  people, like, stupid met at all. <br><br>  They were already alerted by the link to registration on the freelance site with his nickname at the end and the site description capability at the speed of ‚Äúseveral days / site‚Äù, which was silently offered by him. <br><br>  Word for word, and we had such a dialogue (spelling and punctuation are preserved, personal data are hidden for obvious reasons): <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>XXX</b> <br>  so how do u with print? <br><br>  <b>Umkus</b> <br>  I'm typing fine.  This is my main occupation. <br><br>  <b>XXX</b> <br>  clear <br>  if me will have an option to print? <br>  that is, I make a decision, I appeal to you <br>  telling <br>  you are typing <br>  I give a little dough <br>  interested in? <br>  For example, if I take 200-300 dollars for a project, the solution is already invented, why don't you make 30 bucks stupidly for typing? <br><br>  <b>Umkus</b> <br>  Wait, what's the system?  What will I recruit? <br><br>  <b>XXX</b> <br>  code <br><br>  <b>Umkus</b> <br>  Those.  you will say that = something like ‚ÄúConnect to the base, make a request, and output the result in the table‚Äù, and I type it? <br><br>  <b>XXX</b> <br>  Yes <br>  I will talk down to the functions if you do not know <br>  full algorithm <br><br>  <b>Umkus</b> <br>  You forgive me, of course, but for some reason it seems to me that you hold me for an idiot. <br><br>  <b>XXX</b> <br>  why? <br>  type a few pages of variables for $ 10 per hour <br>  I'm just typing rather slowly <br>  and the more it annoys me, the slower the speed <br>  so I lose time, even if I don‚Äôt spend it on finding projects, I‚Äôd better spend it on my family <br>  and $ 10 per hour for dialing code is quite decent in my opinion <br>  you will not need to develop an algorithm <br>  I just say write an array with this sort of <br>  and you recruit, learn along the way <br>  =) <br>  what is bad? <br>  explain, can I not understand the thread? <br><br>  <b>Umkus</b> <br>  Just hold on ... <br>  Come on, XXX, good luck to you. <br><br>  A curtain‚Ä¶ <br><br>  But wait!  Maybe a person has a talent?  Perhaps he really ate a dog on heavy algorithms and the development of weighty systems and he has something to learn?  But no.  A superficial analysis of the work done by the freelancer revealed that the works by these were mainly bug fixes of existing applications and their often non-essential modifications. <br><br>  Not.  The man just types it out slowly, his job is annoying ... And this is the notorious ‚ÄúTop Rated‚Äù freelancer? <br><br>  It's a shame, comrade freelancer!  Shame on you </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/48375/">https://habr.com/ru/post/48375/</a></p>
