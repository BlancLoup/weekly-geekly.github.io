      Or the girl Anya saw new shoes in the store and wanted to buy.  There was a sinfulness of ‚Äúpride‚Äù - she wants to brag to her friends.  And maybe ‚Äúenvy‚Äù, if a friend bought new beautiful shoes, and Ani now does not have enough money.  The relationship is becoming visible: sin is a need.  And in this article we will learn how to use them for the benefit of quick qualification of needs. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  What is sin? </h2><br>  To sell well, you need to be well versed in the deepest motives and desires of a person.  There is one indisputable truth: all needs come from one beginning - the instinct of survival.  Needs help the individual or the species to which he belongs to survive. <br><br>  Let's break down sin and break it down.  To begin, we give a definition.  Sin is the need of the individual, which, when satisfied without measure, begins to bring harm.  More often it is a series of instinctive drives that work at a subconscious level.  But they are not given complete freedom.  They are controlled by the conscious, which limits them and gives an assessment of the actions.  Under certain circumstances, this control may be weakened, and the person commits a sin. <br><br><blockquote>  There is no person ‚Äúwho lives and does not sin, and that no one is clean from filth even if he lives on earth for one day‚Äù (Job 14: 4-5). </blockquote><br>  Consider the first sin - ‚Äúpride‚Äù (pride, vanity) At the heart of sin is the need to demonstrate and protect their status.  A person is proud of something and starts, consciously or unconsciously, to demonstrate this to society.  What happens if a person does not demonstrate status? <br><br>  <b>A chain of consequences follows: low level in the social hierarchy -&gt; lack of resources (no protection and little food) -&gt; death.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  This is illustrated by the example of the homeless.  They ceased to demonstrate the status of a minimum acceptable in society (tidy appearance) and society stopped giving them resources, which greatly complicated their task of survival.  Now the ultimate benefit of demonstrating status becomes clear: the individual wants to survive. <br><br>  But what will happen if you stop controlling this need?  Then again there will be a threat to the life of an individual already from the side of another sin - the envy of the congeners.  They may stop communicating, robbing or even kill him.  That contradicts the goals of survival.  Therefore, the best strategy is to maintain a balance. <br><br><h2>  How do sins use in sales? <br></h2><br>  Consider a good example with the iPhone.  Apple immediately asked a clear positioning - a phone for the elite.  But dozens of new models of phones from other brands are much better in performance and cheaper.  However, millions of people buy the iPhone.  It comes to madness when people start to take turns in a few days before the start of sales.  Try asking the iPhone owner why he chose this phone.  The answer will be absolutely illogical, emotional and contain Apple-imposed stereotypes: beautiful, convenient, fast, best, good camera. <br><br><blockquote>  According to TechInsights, the income that Apple receives from each sold iPhone is at around 60%. </blockquote><br>  In reality, a cheaper model of another brand would suit the customer.  But the buyer pays extra for the intangible imaginary property "status", the cost of production in which is zero.  Thus, skillfully influencing the need to stand out in the hierarchy (the sin of ‚Äúpride‚Äù), Apple created a huge demand for products and began selling phones with an unprecedentedly high margin. <br><br>  For sales of any product, you can apply this method of labeling needs with sins. <br><br>  <b>The trick: the more sins we catch people, the more they will be tied to the product.</b> <br><br><h2>  Examples </h2><br>  <b>Fitness Center Extreme Fitness.</b>  <b>Sins for a woman:</b> <b><br></b> <br><ul><li>  pride (I want to get approval); </li><li>  envy (a friend has a better figure); </li><li>  lust (marry well). </li></ul><br>  <b>Restaurant Honest.</b>  <b>Guest sins:</b> <b><br></b> <br><ul><li>  gluttony (a lot of delicious food and alcohol); </li><li>  greed (cheap). </li></ul><br>  <b>Yandex Food.</b>  <b>Sins for the client:</b> <b><br></b> <br><ul><li>  gluttony (lots of delicious food); </li><li>  laziness (no need to go for food, they themselves will bring). </li></ul><br>  <b>Timati concert.</b>  <b>Sins for the visitor:</b> <b><br></b> <br><ul><li>  idleness (I do not want to work, derived from laziness); </li><li>  lust (looking for a woman); </li><li>  pride (I will take a photo with the artist, upload photos on Instagram). </li></ul><br>  <b>Car alarm Starline.</b>  <b>Sins for a motorist:</b> <b><br></b> <br><ul><li>  laziness (reluctance to go down to warm the car, it is inconvenient to close the door with a key); </li><li>  greed (if I steal, I lose a lot of money). </li></ul><br>  <b>English courses.</b>  <b>Student sins:</b> <b><br></b> <br><ul><li>  anger: (unfair treatment of foreigners for you if you don‚Äôt know the language). </li></ul><br>  <b>Instagram service.</b>  <b>User sins:</b> <b><br></b> <br><ul><li>  jealousy (look like with friends, I want the same); </li><li>  Pride (I want to brag myself). </li></ul><br>  <b>BMW car.</b>  <b>Owner sins:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  laziness (I don't want to walk or wait for the bus); </li><li>  Pride (I want to show how cool I am). </li></ul><br>  <b>Lada car.</b>  <b>Owner sins:</b> <b><br></b> <br><ul><li>  laziness (I don't want to walk or wait for the bus); </li><li>  greed (not enough money, do not want to earn more). </li></ul><br>  That is why BMW and AvtoVAZ are not direct competitors on the market.  Audiences have different needs, despite the fact that the main function of both cars is movement. <br><br>  <b>Thus, using the methodology for qualifying needs for sins, you can quickly create an avatar of the target audience segment and use them in creating sales strategies.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/450692/">https://habr.com/ru/post/450692/</a></p>
