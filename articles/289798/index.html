In the ‚Äútrade‚Äù segment, the share of search engines reaches 37.22%.  Services for the promotion of sites in demand.  At the same time ordering SEO customers are afraid.  The case when you want and prickly.  Let us examine the main fears that we encountered when dealing with customers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/f29/caf/33f/f29caf33faf7d175b03906351876bb08.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Fear of wasting money</b> <br>  The main fear of the client.  Money must be paid today, and the result is promised in 4-6 months.  This is hard and distrustful. <br>  Customers want to pay "for the result, not for the air."  At the same time they pay billboards, without demanding guarantees that 100500 customers will call them.  Acquire the services of doctors who take money for admission, and not for guaranteed recovery. <br>  Customers require 100% guarantees where they cannot be.

      <b>Fear caused by other people's words</b> <br>  The marketing guru, whom the client honors, has spoken badly about seo.  The junior partner said that website promotion is a hoax.  My wife advised me not to get involved, because they wrote to Cosmo - seo does not work.  Any person from the client‚Äôs environment - a brother, a matchmaker, a secretary, a friend or a lover - can be an authoritative expert in Internet marketing. <br>  The client trusts them, even if they carry nonsense.  Because he himself understands even less. <br><br>  <b>Fear of past mistakes</b> <br>  One third of customers come with negative promotion experience.  Previous contractors failed.  Or the client thinks so, because the understanding of the goals was different.  Or a regular webmaster ruined the site.  The reasons are different, the result is the same: the client did not get the effect he expected. <br>  The customer is disappointed in the optimizer, in the service, in the search engine optimization market. <br><br>  <b>Fear of being deceived</b> <br>  Customers are afraid that they will take money from them and will not work on the site.  Or do much less than promised. <br>  Candid swindlers among the companies to promote a little more than those who pledged, but could not.  No need to promise the impossible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/e51/f18/178/e51f18178429e022b5d9a3071cecec7c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Fear of overpay</b> <br>  Seo market has not yet been formed.  It employs agencies with a staff of 100-200 people and companies with a couple of employees.  For the promotion of the same site, the cost is different at times.  Even the agencies of the same weight category. <br>  In the commercial offer, the customer is offered promotion in 25 words, in the larger semantic core, in traffic, in a complex, with and without writing texts, with and without modifications. <br>  The client does not catch the difference.  For a client, this is one SEO service.  At least half choose the price.  Burn and get the fear of past mistakes. <br><br>  Repeatedly, I came across the fact that clients are leaving the seo-agency with the desire to save money.  They are satisfied with the work on promotion, but they want to pay less.  And then even less, not realizing the risks of changing the contractor.  From us so left.  And so they came to us. <br><br>  <b>Fear of change</b> <br>  Starting new is scary.  It is doubly scary if you have to pay for it with a ruble. <br>  Why look for new channels to attract customers if the old ones work?  It is not clear whether the seo will shoot or not.  Does search promotion work in my category?  Under the seo will have to change the site.  It costs time.  Problems!  Maybe, well it, this promotion?  - such thoughts in the head of the client. <br>  He does not see the benefits of investing in change.  The fear of the new overpowers. <br><br>  <b>Fear of repeating other people's negative experiences</b> <br>  Partners of the customer promoted the site, spent 200 thousand, the result is zero.  The customer is afraid of repeating the story. <br>  Another negative experience affects the client. <br><br>  <b>Fear of being incompetent</b> <br>  Customer marketer poorly versed in promotion.  At the meeting, the agency manager uses unfamiliar terms.  The longer a marketer listens, the more discouraged the face.  The desire to quickly end the conversation. <br>  Even if a person plans to order a service, the fear of appearing incompetent is present.  Deliver thoughts of seo in clear language. <br>  Not the most popular fear.  It is even less common with business owners than hired marketers. <br><br>  <b>Fear of driving the site under the filters</b> <br>  This fear is rare.  If customers were more afraid to get sanctions from search engines, resources for us under the AGS, Penguin and Panda filters would not get into our work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/fd4/80a/ad6/fd480aad664e8b0788feb570673354d3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Site in the top, no sales</b> <br>  The customer is afraid of a decline in sales, even if the site is advanced.  Subtype of fear of spending money in vain.  This can happen if: <br><br><ul><li>  The niche is too narrow / new. </li><li>  This product is seasonal and not looking for it. </li><li>  The promotion strategy is initially erroneous (few inquiries, wrong semantic core). </li><li>  The order form broke on the site. </li></ul><br><br>  Otherwise, sales will grow.  Even if the site is a curve, and the managers are mute.  The site and before the promotion was crooked, and the manager is mute.  But they sold.  Another thing is that sales will grow even higher if you correct the curvature and dumbness. <br><br><h3>  What is the problem? </h3><br>  Danger crept from two sides. <br><br>  Objectively, SEO is a risky type of advertising.  There is a chance that something will go wrong.  It's a shame when ‚Äúnot so‚Äù happens with your project.  Search engines do not obey optimizers.  Agencies are trying to influence them, using both official recommendations and tricks. <br>  Clients transfer risks to agencies, those to clients. <br><br>  The second problem is customer ignorance.  Half of them about promotion have vague ideas.  Even worse, when the myths in my head.  Hence, the wrong goals and wishes in the spirit: ‚Äúhere are 10 requests, I need top 2 with guarantees‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need Google, only Yandex is interested‚Äù. <br>  Misunderstanding by customers of the specifics of the service is a serious problem for the market.  And it creates and strengthens the fears of the client. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289798/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289798/</a></p>
