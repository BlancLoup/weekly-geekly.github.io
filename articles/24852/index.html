  <section class="page js-page"><h1>read less, work more</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Since childhood, I have no love for books in which they say: <br><ul><li>  How to make a million; </li><li>  What is the best way to train (I confess, when I did boxing, I decided to read one book of some famous coach); </li><li>  How to become beautiful (oops); </li><li>  How to become smart (oops); </li><li>  How to succeed; </li></ul><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Therefore, I very rarely read blogs on the topic (as it is fashionable to say now) Lifehack.  But today I read <a href="http://romanpushkin.blogspot.com/2007/10/blog-post.html" title="Your weapon is a shovel. Roman Pushkin">one interesting post</a> in which the author says: <br><blockquote>  I can tell you - here it is, this post.  This post has everything you need.  No extra thoughts.  You have already understood that there are not and will not be any magic recipes.  Magic days are not and never will.  You have a tool - your capabilities.  You have an uncultivated field - your life.  Begin, use your time resource to plow the field.  Of course, you can run across the field to plow it faster.  But you get tired faster.  You can find a tractor, but where and how long you will search for it.  Are you ready for this?  Your weapon is a shovel, take it and work it.  There are no ‚Äú1000 secrets of successful people‚Äù, ‚Äú10 proven ways to plow a field in 10 seconds‚Äù. </blockquote><br>  Personally, I think that the time spent reading some techniques in which the author promises mountains of gold is a waste of time.  I do not deny there are interesting and correct books, but how to distinguish the wheat from the chaff.  I easily worked out ways for myself: <br><ul><li>  If in the book the author starts praising the method from the very beginning, tells how he achieved a lot, then this book is 100% complete shit, if you don‚Äôt know the name of the author, otherwise it will be at least an interesting book of a successful person. </li><li>  If the author writes that you can easily achieve success in 21 days, just read the book to the end, then this is again a complete bullshit. </li><li>  If the author writes that you will achieve overwhelming success, then he, I am 85% sure, simply lies. </li></ul><br>  All this, immediately clear, is done in order to make you read the book to the end, or at least buy it.  For example, take the following inscription on the back of the book (he made it up himself): <br><blockquote>  Author: V. Pupkin <br>  Professor of Mathematical Sciences of the State Mathematical University, Nobel Prize laureate, Oscar, and a whole heap of awards and diplomas.  Analyst of a large company whose name is a financial secret. <br>  In this book will tell you: <br><ul><li>  how without knowledge of probability theory and mathematical analysis, in just 5 days, win a million in a national lottery. </li><li>  how to play currency rates and securities to multiply a million, and get 20 million in just 15 days, </li><li>  how, without knowledge of economics, in just 10 days, create your own business, and get 200 million (and this is not the limit) profit, with minimal costs. </li><li>  how to get hold of the girl of your dreams. </li></ul><br>  What this book will give you: after reading this book, and with a little effort, with minimal investment (money for a couple of lottery tickets), you can achieve business success that you can only dream of in a month. </blockquote><br>  I can already imagine how many people will buy this book (they will buy it, but they will not admit it to anyone), how many then it will be sold, as their method in all kinds of electronic stores.  After all, the main goal that the author sets is not to teach you something.  He needs the book to be sold. <br><br>  By the way, the same can be said about Internet homeless people.  What do you think they are blogging for?  Yes, they earn on the Internet, they do not hesitate to arrange their financial striptease, they share techniques and programs.  But I want to say only one thing, they do not spoil the whole topic, they will write about what everyone is writing.  Their main goal is not to teach SEO.  The main objectives: to get a lot of unique and links with the homeless for less, to raise their credibility, and find customers. <br><br>  Recently, I began to observe that mostly good books and other media resources are more like a reference book or a textbook.  After all, people learn from programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãbooks.  And more often they choose reference books and self-textbooks than the series for teapots (among other things, the series for teapots covers not only computer subjects, but also teaching others that already makes a normal person think).

      My opinion: less reading, more work.  In the book or on the Internet you have to look, then, when questions arise.  They say that smart people learn from the mistakes of others, but then it turns out that fools are more experienced, and smart people learn from fools.  I have it in my head does not fit.  I think that you first need to try, and then watch how everyone does.  What if you do better. <br><br>  PS Again from the saying, it turns out that I am not a clever <strike>fool</strike> , I started a lot by asking myself the question, where to start?  What was a big mistake when I read a book, I often lost interest in starting something at all.  Maybe that is why earlier it was hard for me to decide.  Now I work, if it turns out - I am happy, if not - I read. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24852/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24852/</a></p>
