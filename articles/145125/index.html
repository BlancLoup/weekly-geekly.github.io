For deepening using conventional household electric jackhammer with sufficient impact energy. <br><br>  As in the case of the ‚Äúcasing‚Äù (Section <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/144731/">G2</a> ) - a large area of ‚Äã‚Äãcontact of the grounding conductor with the ground is achieved by a large length (depth) of the electrode.  Due to the achievement of the deep layers of soil, in most cases having less electrical resistivity, this method has greater efficiency (less ground resistance). <br><br><br><br><br><br>  Connecting pins to each other can be done in several ways: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>‚ÄúBlind hole + thorn‚Äù</b> .  On one side of the pin there is a blind hole 50-70 mm deep, and on the other side there is a spike 50-70 mm long, having a diameter slightly larger than the groove.  When mounting the spike is pressed into the hole. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/da8/7b7/b3c/da87b7b3c7ccff3d06794bc256f04bf5.png"><br><br></li><li>  <b>‚ÄúBlind hole + pin + blind hole‚Äù</b> .  The pin on both sides has a blind hole 50-70 mm deep.  The pin length 100-140 mm is used as a separate additional part.  During installation, it is inserted between the pins and pressed into both holes. <br>  <i>It is considered a very unreliable method of connection.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/197/3e3/3b7/1973e33b71a6f33a0f712b4abf37d8e1.png"><br><br></li><li>  <b>"Thread + coupling + thread"</b> .  The pin on both sides has a thread length of 50 mm.  Coupling, pipe section with internal thread, is used as a separate additional part.  During installation, it is screwed onto the recessed pin, after which the next pin is screwed into it. <br>  <i>As the long-term practice has shown, this is the most reliable method of connection, allowing to assemble precast grounding electrodes up to 40 meters deep with guaranteed preservation of the necessary electrical and anti-corrosion properties along all lengths.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>This depth is a compromise between the maximum impact energy of the jackhammer, the friction force between the mounted electrode and the ground, the mechanical strength of the coupling (its cost).</i>  <i>Without an increase in the impact energy, it is impossible for the electrode to become even deeper due to the friction force.</i>  <i>With increasing impact energy, it is necessary to increase the strength of the coupling, which causes an increase in its cost.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dd8/a60/622/dd8a6062211a1797a3fc911b2601cedc.png"><br></li></ul><br><br><br><a name="d11"></a><h5>  D1.1.  Solution features.  Anti-corrosion properties. </h5><br><a name="d111"></a><h6>  D1.1.1.  Versatility and ease of use </h6>  This solution can be called a ‚Äúconstructor‚Äù, because  any necessary construction is assembled from unified elements.  For example, a deep electrode at 30 meters. <br>  All parts have industrial production, which eliminates the need to ‚Äúfinish‚Äù something on the object.  At the same time, they have the same quality and the same properties, which plays a role when carrying out a large amount of installation work on many similar objects, and also has a positive effect on the predictability of results. <br><br>  The handling of pins is facilitated because  They are only 1.5 meters long and weigh no more than 3 kilograms.  This allows you to transport them in a small car. <br><br><br><a name="d112"></a><h6>  D1.1.2.  Long service life </h6>  Coating a steel pin with a layer of zinc or copper increases its service life up to several times (relative to the service life of a pin of the same size without coating). <br><br>  Methods of protecting steel from corrosion in coatings vary greatly due to the different participation of these metals in electrochemical reactions, which have the most destructive effect on the pin.  Due to the difference in these reactions, the difference in production, the difference in the cost of production, there are constant disputes over which coating is still better. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Zinc coating</b> <br><br>  In the pair of ‚Äúzinc-iron‚Äù zinc is a reducing / donor ( <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">wiki</a> ).

Iron is primarily oxidized / corroded by iron, thus protecting copper. <br><br>  <i>Strange ... we need the opposite action.</i>  But here lies the peculiarity of the electrochemical reaction: it is possible only in the presence of electrolyte / water.  If iron is isolated from it, the reaction stops. <br><br>  Therefore, the copper coating must be thick and uniform in order to prevent its deep damage during installation and thus prevent electrolyte / water from entering the iron. <br><br>  At the same time, the softness / plasticity of pure copper has a positive effect: it greatly reduces the friction force when scratching, which does not allow the sharp element in the ground (for example, stone) to completely scratch the coating in depth to the steel core.  The stone simply glides over the surface, removing a small outer layer.  This behavior of copper can be compared with soap, used to remove a ring stuck on a finger. <br><br>  <font color="green"><b>Advantages:</b></font> <font color="green"><br></font> <ul><li>  very long service life of copper-coated pin - up to 100 years (subject to the integrity of the coating) </li></ul><br>  <font color="red"><b>Disadvantages:</b></font> <font color="red"><br></font> <ul><li>  the need to create a coating of large thickness (200 microns) to protect it from deep damage during installation.

An extensive study of underground corrosion was carried out, during which 36,500 samples representing 333 varieties of ferrous and non-ferrous metals and protective materials were tested at 128 sites throughout the United States. <br>  One of the results of this study was the fact that the ground pin, coated with 254 microns of copper, retains its technical characteristics for more than 40 years in most types of soil.  And rod electrodes, coated with 99.06 microns of zinc, in the same soils can retain their qualities only for 10-15 years. <br><blockquote>  Underground corrosion (United States.

Super compact </h6>  The small length of the pins and the use of a small-sized power tool allows you to install the deep earthing where before it was in principle impossible: at sites with the most constrained building construction and even in the basements of buildings.  When working outside the building, a ‚Äúpatch‚Äù of earth with a diameter of 20 cm is enough to deepen the electrode. <br><br>  Such compactness is especially relevant in light of the need to obtain a large number of documents for opening coverage, carrying out work and the subsequent refining of the territory. <br><br><br><a name="d115"></a><h6>  D1.1.5.  No welding </h6>  All elements of the design are securely mated without electric or gas welding.  Used either permanent or threaded connections.

Calculation of the received grounding resistance </h5>  The calculation almost completely repeats the calculation of a single electrode from Section <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/144731/">G2.2.</a>  with the exception of transverse dimensions - with modular grounding the diameter of the electrode does not exceed 20 mm <br><blockquote>  <em>On the example of a <i><u>thirty-</u></i> <u><i>meter</i></u> composite electrode of copper-plated pins with a diameter of <u><i>14 mm</i></u> , mounted in a ditch with a depth of <u><i>0.5 meters</i></u> .</em>  <em>The soil in which this electrode will be mounted will be, to simplify the calculation, homogeneous loam, common to Russia, with a specific electrical resistance of <i><u>100 Ohm * m</u></i> .</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>The calculation is carried out in 1 stage.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>The grounding resistance of a single vertical grounding electrode is calculated by the formula:</em> <em><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c07/cb3/df2/c07cb3df29d491365e2aa53425acb593.png"><br></em> </blockquote>  R1 will be <font color="green">4.7 Ohm</font> (at p = 100 Ohm * m, L = 30 m, d = 0.014 m (14 mm), T = 15.5 m <i>(T is the distance from the upper ground level to the middle of the recessed electrode)</i> ). <br><br>  This result is worse than that of an electrode having a diameter of 100 mm, but I note that a decrease in the diameter of the electrode by 7 times (700%) caused an increase in the grounding resistance of only 27%. <br><br><br><a name="d13"></a><h5>  D1.3.  Installation </h5>  Installation of modular grounding is very easy and is available even to the girl. <br>  The pins are driven into the ground one by one with a jackhammer, gradually increasing the depth of the grounding electrode.  Jackhammer is located above the pin. <br>  The installer‚Äôs tasks: to keep the hammer evenly above the pin (not ‚Äúon weight‚Äù, ie, the hammer with its weight presses not on the hands, but on the mounted pin) and to build up the electrode - to install the next pin above the already recessed one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7bd/d11/d9e/7bdd11d9e5a5281589a6429be88891f2.png"><br><br>  If the installation is performed outside the building, the installation of the modular grounding / earthing switch is made in a ditch of a small length and a depth of 0.5 meters, which also contains the grounding conductor (copper wire or traditional steel strip) that goes to the object (electrical panel). <br><br>  If the installation is carried out inside the building (in the basement), then the installation of the earthing switch is made at the floor level.  Next, the copper wire obtained earthing connects to the shield. <br><br>  Both when using steel strip and when using copper wire, a bolt clamp in brass or stainless steel is mainly used to connect them to the pin. <br><br>  Sometimes you can find a way to connect using exothermic welding (a mixture of combustible material with copper dust fills the point of contact between the conductor and the pin, welding them together).  But this is exotic. <br><blockquote>  More information about mounting threaded pins can be found on YouTube ( <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D8dfn00rw7PU">link</a> ). </blockquote>  <i>UPD: A jackhammer can be rented for a day (from 500-700 rubles) or purchased at almost any power tool store (from 9-10 thousand rubles).</i> <br><br><br><a name="d14"></a><h5>  D1.4.

it has two huge drawbacks:</i> <i><br></i> <ul><li>  due to the salt leaching from the ground (rain, spring snow melting), the ion concentration drops to its natural level in 2-3 years </li><li>  Salts cause severe corrosion of steel, destroying electrodes and grounding conductor in 3-5 years.  These shortcomings threaten to restore the grounding almost from scratch. </li></ul></blockquote><br>  Needed measures to counter these shortcomings and they became: <br><ul><li>  constant maintenance of the concentration of ions in the soil.  In other words, their replenishment with new portions. </li><li>  use in the construction of materials that are minimally exposed to salt, and less aggressive components of these salts </li></ul><br>  As a result, a solution was developed that was called ‚Äúelectrolytic grounding‚Äù <i>(electrolyte - salt solution)</i> . <br><br>  An electrode of this type is a tube of short length (usually 2-3 meters) made of stainless steel, which has a perforation almost along its entire length.  Inside this tube are granules (not powder) of a mixture of salts. <br><blockquote>  <i>In addition to the usual NaCl, there are 3 more components in the mixture.</i>  <i>The composition is supposedly a secret of the manufacturers, but we know how it happens :-)</i> </blockquote><br>  Industrially produced two types of pipes.  Vertically and horizontally (in the form of a rotated letter ‚ÄúG‚Äù - like this ‚ÄúI ___‚Äù. <br>  Such an electrode is placed in the ground: vertical execution - in a pre-made well of the required depth (2.5 - 3.5 meters);  horizontal execution - into a previously dug ditch 0.7 meters deep 2.5 meters long. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9d4/2f9/d80/9d42f9d80b2aa5ecc3910f934808c120.png"><br><br>  Moisture from the soil is absorbed by salts in the electrode and comes out in the form of a solution (electrolyte) into the same soil, impregnating it and causing a decrease in its specific electrical resistance. <br>  Because of this, the grounding resistance of the electrode (pipe) placed in this ground is reduced. <br><br>  Because  a mixture of salts is in the granules and in its composition there is a special additive, it does not dissolve in its entirety in the springtime, when the soil is saturated with water.  In this way, a long-term and uniform electrolyte output from the electrode is achieved, gradually increasing (and not just preserving) the concentration of ions in the surrounding soil.  Usually, the factory ‚Äúcharging‚Äù of the electrode lasts for 15 years, after which repeated ‚Äúrefueling‚Äù <u>is possible</u> . <br><br>  The use of a stainless steel pipe as a material and the use of a salt mixture less aggressive than NaCl ensure the service life of the ‚Äúshell‚Äù of such an electrode for at least 50 years. <br><br><br><a name="d21"></a><h5>  D2.1.  Solution features </h5><br><br><a name="d211"></a><h6>  D2.1.1.  Easy to use in permafrost or stony ground </h6>  The design of the electrolytic grounding electrode allows it to be used in ‚Äúproblem‚Äù soils. <br><blockquote>  Permafrost soils are constantly (year-round for hundreds of years) frozen.  Meet in the north of our country.  The depth of freezing of such soil reaches 2 kilometers (near Yakutsk).  Permafrost begins from 1-2 meters above ground level, i.e.  from the depths that can not warm the sun in the summer. <br>  Permafrost soil is very difficult for building earthing: it has a very high electrical resistance (100-300 times more loam) and has the property of ‚Äúpushing‚Äù metal electrodes out of itself due to the effect of water expansion during freezing.  This occurs after summer thawing of the soil (the transition of ground moisture into a liquid state) under these electrodes. <br><br>  Stony soil containing a large number of stones ranging in size from a fist to meter-high boulders is no less difficult for the construction of earthing due to the fact that it is difficult to submerge electrodes in the usual way - stones interfere. </blockquote>  To install an electrode of this type in a horizontal version, only a shallow depth (0.7 meter) is needed, which is relatively easy to dig in both types of soil.  Placing the electrode in the top layer of soil above the permafrost eliminates the effect of ‚Äúpushing‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/271/304/e6b/271304e6bbf2bb1eca116e6663f781c6.png"><br><br>  The small penetration of the electrode makes it possible to use it limitedly in the rock shoes - if there is at least a meter layer of loose (above the ‚Äúimpregnation‚Äù with the electrolyte) soil above the stone monolith. <br><br><br><a name="d212"></a><h6>  D2.1.2.  Compactness </h6>  Electrolytic grounding electrode is up to 12 times more efficient than a conventional steel electrode of the same size.  This means a 12-fold reduction in the required number of grounding elements, and therefore the area occupied by them is significantly reduced. <br>  At the same time, the dependence of ground resistance on the season is very weakened due to a decrease in the freezing point of water with an increase in salt concentration in it to -5 degrees (the temperature of the usual soil under the snow cap).  This removes the need to use additional grounding electrodes to compensate for the increase in resistance in winter. <br><br><br><a name="d213"></a><h6>  D2.1.3.  Talik formation </h6>  The property of the electrode to reduce the soil freezing temperature has a negative point.  A talik zone ( <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA">wiki</a> ) is formed near the electrode, which may pose a danger to the foundation of a nearby building or pavement.  The talik zone on the ground surface is an oval measuring about 3x6 meters.  Therefore, in the course of design work, it is necessary to take this into account and distance the electrodes from objects that may be damaged. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/58a/cc3/529/58acc3529eed4f6de517eb24ce1ead2e.png"><br><br><br><a name="d214"></a><h6>  D2.1.4.  No welding </h6>  A special bolt clamp made of brass or stainless steel is used to attach the grounding conductor to the mounted electrode. <br><br><br><a name="d22"></a><h5>  D2.2.  Calculation of the received grounding resistance </h5>  I will give an example of calculating the grounding resistance of an electrode of horizontal execution, since  This is the most common variant in practice, having a horizontal length of <i>2.4 meters</i> and its diameter of <i>65 mm</i> .  The soil, as usual, will be a homogeneous loam with a specific electrical resistance of <i>100 Ohm * m</i> . <br><br>  The grounding resistance of a single horizontal grounding electrode is calculated by the formula: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e81/30e/e32/e8130ee323d99296c0a141599e8c2c8b.png"><br><br>  In the case of an electrolytic grounding electrode, a factor is added to the formula that describes the concentration of electrolyte in the soil around this electrode: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cba/ad4/a45/cbaad4a4576d405dd5ae331acecbd2f3.png"><br><br>  The coefficient varies from 0.5 to 0.05.  Gradually, it decreases, because  electrolyte penetrates the ground to a larger volume, while increasing its concentration.  In ordinary soil, it is 0.125 after 1-2 months of salt leaching.  The process can be accelerated by adding water to the electrode at the final stage of installation. <br><br>  R1 will be <font color="green">4.14 Ohms</font> (at C = 0.125, p = 100 Ohm * m, L = 2.4 m, d = 0.065 m (65 mm), T = 0.6 m <i>(T is the distance from the upper ground level to the middle of the recessed electrode)</i> ). <br><br>  Excellent result for a single earthing device with a size of only 2.4 meters! <br>  But, as always, the payment for the result in the price of such an electrode ...
