  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Interviews with people not without whose participation WAP has become what it is</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As a supplement to the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/mobile_20/52373/">chapter on the history of ruWAP</a> , I interviewed three people, before our eyes and not without the participation of which WAP has become what it is now. <br>  So, I present the interviewees: <br><ul><li>  <strong>DeeSee</strong> - the founding father of <a href="http://s-c.ru/">WAP.Siemens-Club.Ru</a> </li><li>  <strong><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/unnamed777/" class="user_link">unnamed777</a></strong> - Administrator of several popular WAP sites (I don‚Äôt <strong><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/unnamed777/" class="user_link">provide</a></strong> addresses at the request of him), moderator in several sections on the <a href="http://forum.s-c.ru/">sc.ru forum</a> , one of the pWAP teachers. </li><li>  <strong>Aryan</strong> - the administrator of the increasingly popular <a href="http://dmobi.ru/">portal</a> and the most popular <a href="http://c-cl.mobi/">click club in WAP</a> </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Interview with the founder of SC.ru - DeeSee </h3><br>  <strong>[rk]:</strong> How did you get acquainted with WAP? <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> Essentially, the operators started up the test run of GPRS (for a few months the GPRS was free) ... <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> Once at the time of launching into test operation at MTS, I got a phone with GPRS support ... <br>  <strong>DeeSee: it is a</strong> sin not to take advantage of a freebie :) <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> that is how an acquaintance with a wap happened ... <br>  <strong>[rk]:</strong> do you remember the first site you remember? <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> camera, like all <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> then the ‚Äúbattles‚Äù of the operators were ... <br>  Beeline and MTS subscribers each sat on their website ... <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> Access was blocked ... <br>  <strong>[rk]:</strong> did you initially use only the services of OpCoSa, and in fact there was no information (or in general) of other sites? <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> there were several websites in a ruwapa, such as: wap.rbk.ru, wap.lenta.ru <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> only some of the largest had similar versions ... essentially like RSS ... translating the news to wap ... <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> but there were no private sites ... <br>  <strong>[rk]:</strong> Which services did the operators provide, which of them were popular, and which ones did you use yourself? <br>  <strong>DeeSee: there</strong> were standard services: weather forecasts, TV programs, news, etc. ... there was a chat for communication, where the communication between happy owners of phones with GPRS took place <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> there were changing links, looking for downloads for phones together and setting up weekly chat rooms ... the audience was at 95% Moscow and Moscow. <br>  <strong>[rk]:</strong> When did the first "amateur" sites appear? <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> well, this was again the flow from the chat ... everyone was tired of exchanging links, began to look for ways to create websites ... at that time few people understood what a wap site creation was ... they were looking for so-called site builders ... Tagtag.com was found, it actually started to appear websites ... Websites were on transliteration, Russian letters were rare for VAP ... Both of them were more actively developed by one of the same chat visitors - Mypuk ... then they began to learn what utf-8 is and free hosting such as nm. ru ... but nevertheless nobody for vap is progr  He amused: who could, laughed at the ‚Äúsmall‚Äù sites, and who wanted to ‚Äî could not ... therefore communication was also limited on these sites ... after six months, the first sites began to appear having some kind of own services, and not links to third-party resources ... <br>  <strong>[rk]:</strong> when did you decide to organize your first WAP site and what was it (is) for the site? <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> the ‚Äúoldies‚Äù had one social circle, the website creation fever took over ... as a rule, websites made for their phone model ... I had Siemens ... during the time spent in the vap, a huge number of pictures, melodies and other things were accumulated ... well-versed in the intricacies of compatibility content for mobile phones ... I decided that in vain knowledge did not disappear, it is necessary to create a website.  Actually, the wap site (wap.siemens-club.ru) was born on such an enthusiasm ... It was distinguished by a large volume of downloads for all Siemens models ... Since  Simens had the most convenient browsers for VAP, their substantial superiority in quantity was natural ... The people reached out ... <br>  <strong>[rk]:</strong> How do I remember it was around 2002? <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> yes, I think 2002 or 2003 ... <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> probably 2003 <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> first half of 2003 - personal website creation fever ... <br>  <strong>[rk]:</strong> Were there any difficulties in creating a site, any specific problems regarding wap browsers? <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> yes, there were a lot of them ... <br>  <strong>DeeSee: besides the</strong> specifics of wml itself, there were features among the browsers themselves ... <br>  let's say it was impossible to create &lt;input&gt; inside the &lt;small&gt; tag ... <br>  browsers have cached data entered in the fields ... <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> and more ... <br>  <strong>[rk]:</strong> did he have a connection and does wap now have a siemens club with siemens-club.ru? <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> the wap and website development teams were different ... but at the moment a new version is already being created in solidarity and the current version is being maintained ... <br>  <strong>[rk]:</strong> it is clear when the first popularity came and is it true that the site owes its popularity to ‚Äúprotest‚Äù against the introduction of biline Internet fees? <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> hard to judge because of this or not ... <br>  The site has steadily grown in attendance.  everyday.  and at the time when the action was planned, ours already occupied a worthy place among similar ones ... the action really attracted attention to the site itself, but I deserved popularity, I think my personality ... at that time, the owners of Siemens were provided with the most advanced innovations ... the same wavs for a call ... now everyone has a mp3 in the phone, and then they counted the number of voices in polyphony, realtone was a breakthrough, and only we were actively creating them ... <br>  <strong>[rk]:</strong> Did you do everything alone or did partners appear? <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> initially there was a small team ... I was always an ideologue and enthusiasm :) I didn‚Äôt stand in one place, I constantly thought out all sorts of things to make people comfortable ... <br>  <strong>[rk]:</strong> it is clear, with increasing popularity probably new ones were required.  capacities - the site at that time already paid for them? <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> no ... the situation was difficult ... the wap project created huge loads on the common server (wap + web) ... because  the web was in higher priority, they even thought of somehow cutting the site to reduce the load ... the specificity of the wap - basically downloading content, non-living chatting ... until we learned what nginx is, the content was given through Apache, but since  GPRS download speed was small - several KBs, while there were so many hanging processes that the RAM was eaten instantly ... the traffic per day was more than 500GB ... nginx saved us, they also threw off their own money and bought servers ... <br>  <strong>[rk]:</strong> It is clear how the idea to create a ‚Äúblacksmith of the talents of ruVAP‚Äù appeared - the forum of the Siemens club and why exactly the forum sc.ru became this very smithy? <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> as I wrote above - I was looking for some new directions in the vape ... at this time I was actively interested in the topic of Siemens re-flashing, writing patches, porting them and stuff ... by the way, the main patch masters were once on the web forum of our site ... I decided that it was worth trying to light up the wap audience with all the possibilities of their Siemens ... since  there is no better place than a forum for discussion, I started creating a wap forum directly ... and so my acquaintance with php happened ... taking a popular web engine for a couple of months, rewrote and adapted it for vap ... further "active" visitors of the file, they flooded into the forum, and the communication went along ... together with the abuses of the visitors, the forum was brought to a really convenient means for communication ... people liked it - they pulled themselves up, and became known to their forum ... <br>  <strong>[rk]:</strong> but you didn‚Äôt stop at sm.ru - sp-c.ru appeared, what can you tell about it? <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> when Siemens began to "curl" ... the sale of the unit of mobile phones to Benq was approaching ... began to look for other directions ... for me, the only interesting option was Symbian platform smartphones ... I bought SX1 and it went ... <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> ... creating a site for smartphones ... <br>  <strong>[rk]: I</strong> see, now let's get a little away from your projects. <br>  <strong>[rk]:</strong> How did the introduction of the monetization of projects affect their popularity, whether there was no outflow of visitors?  (I gave a large number of people an address to the address, and I received an answer from half, ‚Äúeverything is paid, I searched and did not find anything,‚Äù and only showing them that they were downloading, but here it is a forum, they became ‚Äúmembers of the club‚Äù) <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> there was no churn, just like you, friends brought your acquaintances, and with an increase in the general wap-audience, the project continued to grow and remain in the lead ... <br>  <strong>[rk]:</strong> you probably kept visiting statistics - were there any peaks observed and vice versa, did attendance decline, at what time did they have events (did the introduction of gprs pay any impact?), if we consider the overall attendance ‚Äúschedule‚Äù.  since its inception - is the project now (sk) becoming more popular / stable or is there a slowdown in activity? <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> after the introduction of traffic fees, there was an outflow of visitors to the Moscow region ... but at the same time, GPRS was being simultaneously introduced into test operation in other regions ... and history repeated, only with other regions ... <br>  every month the wap-audience grew ... accordingly, our project as a whole grew, although, perhaps, after the news of the sale of Siemens, it was no longer so active ... and then the number of Siemens fell, interest naturally fell ... attracted by its unique forum, which gathered up to 500 users online ... <br>  <strong>[rk]:</strong> Since the advent of WAP, there is an opinion that WAP is a stillborn child, so they say, including many respected people, what is your opinion on this? <br>  <strong>DeeSee: a</strong> look at the developers of large web projects is probably understandable: <br>  there are so many possibilities in the web, such diversity can be offered to the user: if you want a flash site, you want a web 2.0, and against the background of this wap with such scarce features ... <br>  If vap is a markup language - wml, then yes, it really has already died, the progress of mobile organizations has been too great lately, there is no sense in it ... <br>  If vap is a website for mobile devices, such as a phone, then it's hard to call him stillborn ... <br>  It develops like the web, if you do not take into account the hypertext markup, then for a long time large wap projects use the same technologies as in the web ... the same workload, also data caching ... and this is not casual, not from the boredom of wap developers, but from necessity because  The mobile Internet audience continues to grow ... the majority of the mobile phone is at hand, and the laptop is not in the pocket ... in addition, content operators have given a large audience influx into the vapa, with their SMS services through the central channels and in the press, as a rule, it was necessary to go to download in wap ... <br>  <strong>[rk]:</strong> And probably the last question: how do you see the wap in the future, for example, after 5 years, and how do you imagine the Siemens-club and sp-c in the same future? <br>  <strong>DeeSee: the</strong> weak players in the vape will die and the big ones will come from the web (perhaps, those who called him "stillborn") ... <br>  wap and web will already live together ... i.e.  VAP can be called a light version of the site ... <br>  <strong>DeeSee: there are no</strong> bets on sp and <strong>ck</strong> , there are bets on other projects for which a large amount of knowledge has accumulated over the last couple of years on the web ... you need to be ahead of time;) <br>  <strong>[rk]:</strong> Well, let's wait for you to hit and wap the audience again.  Thank you for answering the questions.  :) <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> Yes, there is nothing, it was even pleasant to remember the past :) <br><br>  <u>This interview was conducted a couple of days before the unification of the <a href="http://forum.s-c.ru/">forum.sc.ru</a> engine with <a href="http://waper.ru/">waper.ru</a> , so we talked once again, on the ‚Äúgiven topic‚Äù</u> <br><br>  <strong>[rk]:</strong> Tell us briefly about the events that took place on the sc.ru forum <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> The site has long demanded a change ... <br>  The audience of the site fell, the subject of the site unfortunately is not relevant at the present time ... <br>  To revive the site it is necessary to quite qualitatively and redo a lot ... <br>  One person is quite hard to implement. <br>  It was decided to combine the efforts of the developers of sc.ru and waper.ru over a common engine (please pay attention to the issue of a common engine, not a common site) ... <br>  From this engine s-k will receive further development of the popular forum and downloads on the site, Vaper - communication among active visitors, acquaintances and more ... <br>  The first thing we decided to start with is the forum, as the most important component of the site ... <br>  <strong>[rk]:</strong> At what stage is the unification of the forum now - has everything been done that is planned or is there something in the process / plans? <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> After moving to a new engine - the functionality of the forum was limited to the functionality of the vaper.ru forum‚Ä¶ <br>  Accordingly, now we are working on restoring the functionality of the old forum on a new engine ... <br>  Visitors could already notice a number of convenient innovations. <br>  There is a rather large list of functionalities that we would like to introduce on the forum - we are currently working on it. <br>  <strong>[rk]:</strong> Some users (including some moderators) believe that a ‚Äúuniversity with a kindergarten‚Äù association was made;  Some people left the forum altogether, others opened their old school sc forum.  How can you comment on this? <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> There is a certain contingent of visitors who provoke visitors to wrong actions.  For example, some are trying to lure visitors to their site on the sly.  These people are not so many, but they are extremely active on the forum, they force the atmosphere. <br>  It is obvious that after moving to a new engine, the audience united.  There is nothing wrong with that.  Nobody forces anyone in other Vaper forums. <br>  Later, the forum will already look like a separate component of the site, and not one of the communities.  With its visitors and design.  Position which we will be as the main technical forum. <br>  Similar to the functionality. <br>  My advice to visitors is to remain loyal to them and communicate as before, do not go in the wake of dishonest users! <br>  I repeat that all the requests of the visitors have been heard and are already being implemented. <br>  <strong>[rk]:</strong> You said that no one forces the users of the community to participate in the life of other communities, but here (as far as I know) the users of the vaper themselves are automatically added to the "Siemens-Club community", as is the case now ? <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> No one is automatically added ... Only those visitors are added who decide to chat on the forum with <br>  <strong>[rk]:</strong> You said that the forum is planned to be made the ‚Äúmain technical forum,‚Äù that is, in the end, the name Siemens Club will lose the first part of its name? <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> not really ... <br>  so it will be called SC ... <br>  just at the entrance through <a href="http://s-c.ru/">sc.ru</a> - as was the forum with <br>  When entering through <a href="http://waper.ru/">waper.ru</a> - technical forum <br>  <strong>[rk]:</strong> Can you share plans for the further integration of the engine? <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> there is no sense to go far ahead ... and the closest is to improve the interface for communication in the forum, as well as some functionality for searching downloaded files on the forum <br>  <strong>DeeSee: the</strong> rest of the changes are global and new in general for wap, therefore I will not say anything about them. <br>  <strong>[rk]:</strong> And now the most provocative question is probably: who is now at the helm of the WAP Siemens Club? <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> Everything is as before ... We are both.  I‚Äôm more of a Sergey, a Vaper. <br>  <strong>[rk]:</strong> Is there a significant influx of vaper users to the Siemens Club? And are the opinions true that the ‚Äúgirls‚Äù were flooded with? <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> I did not have time to deeply analyze this issue.  But he definitely noticed the translations of some visitors from smths into the ‚Äúgirls‚Äù. <br>  <strong>[rk]:</strong> What do you want to say to users who are not indifferent to sc fate? <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> Keep chatting on the forum as before.  All that is needed is now.  That which is lacking - will appear. <br>  <strong>DeeSee:</strong> ... and do not pay attention to people who interfere with communication, click the "complain" button)) <br>  <strong>[rk]:</strong> Thanks for the second interview, it was nice to talk :)

    <h3>  Interview with <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/unnamed777/" class="user_link">unnamed777</a> </h3><br>  <strong>[rk]:</strong> How and when did you find out about WAP? <br>  <strong>unnamed777:</strong> I found out, naturally, from the operator‚Äôs site, and I was very upset that I couldn‚Äôt see it on my current phone, however, a WAP site emulator was found on the Web, through which I walked around the sites for a while, but found nothing particularly interesting .  And the first exit from the phone took place on the day of the purchase of a new body - August 7, 2004 <br>  <strong>unnamed777:</strong> The first site can be considered the site of the operator - wap.megafonsib.ru.  After walking a little on the site, I got on the search engine wap.pslink.ru.  From it I went to the first download site - mypuk.ru <br>  <strong>unnamed777:</strong> And right on the same site I realized that the links in the ‚ÄúDownload for Free‚Äù site header always lead to the sites of content providers.  At that time, the sites didn‚Äôt really try to earn money, so they could be happy to walk on them - no to you ‚Äú** la horse‚Äù, ‚Äúxxx game is a creeping member‚Äù.  These were really good sites. <br>  <strong>[rk]:</strong> When did you want to participate in the construction of a WAP yourself? <br>  <strong>unnamed777:</strong> About a week later, when I wanted to upload my wallpaper to the phone, but there was no data cable.  I began to wonder how you can create your site.  If he doesn‚Äôt name the memory, I didn‚Äôt find any domestic designers, but I came across a rather popular mywap.o2.co.uk, where you could create a wap site in transliteration.  But after registration, I realized that I couldn‚Äôt do anything traveling there and scored.  The second time, the desire came when I realized that the teachers in the lyceum, in tests, allow using phones as calculators.  It was decided to create pages with spurs on the basis of the analysis and geometry. <br>  <strong>unnamed777:</strong> Since I didn‚Äôt yet know what wml was, but I knew what html was (the level was limited to basic tags), I downloaded a few wap pages from wap.mypuk.ru, wap.siemens-club.ru and wap.ngs.ru.  The study of the wml markup structure began with them. <br>  <strong>unnamed777:</strong> Two weeks later, a small site wapshpora.nm.ru was born, the address of which was distributed among classmates (in the lyceum we had groups, not classes), which they successfully used.  It was then that I learned that not every wap site can normally open on the phone.  Here, it seems to me, from that moment my life began in a vape <br>  <strong>[rk]:</strong> And at this time he himself used what sites, or rather what services on them he preferred? <br>  <strong>unnamed777:</strong> Actually, there were no special services then.  Sites were either home pages or downloads.  I always downloaded only on one site - wap.siemens-club.ru, because there was always a lot of content and there was a search on this content, which was a rarity in those days <br>  <strong>[rk]:</strong> As I understand it, did you have Siemens at that time? <br>  <strong>unnamed777:</strong> yes <br>  <strong>[rk]:</strong> When you got to the sc forum, what it was for you / is / will be for the resource, what relation do you have to it ... in general, tell me everything about the forum <br>  <strong>unnamed777:</strong> I registered on it on February 27, 2005, was a bit like sections and left.  Why - I don‚Äôt know, maybe this idea seemed hopeless.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first post was left there only in September of the same year, when I unsuccessfully patched my, already new, Siemens CX70 and no rollback to backup, during the flashing they could not restore the body. I could not get an answer, but that very night I made my own pet. Then I realized that I could help other forum participants myself and began to sit in the ‚ÄúSiemens xx65‚Äù section. And in the first week or two I received three positives for the answers. Somewhere in November, I decided to see a list of other existing forums. And to my surprise, I found the ‚ÄúWAP-resources‚Äù forum, which at that time was the ideal forum. All told each other, helped. There was still no special advertising of their </font></font><strike><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">shit</font></font></strike><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">sites with invitations without fail to visit this particular site and register on it. Clear questions, understandable answers, interesting topics, in which you can always penetrate into someone's discussion and contribute. </font></font><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">[rk]:</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> As I became a moderator, did this `work` heavily burden it on a" voluntary basis ", as I understand it - do you plan to help another forum in the future? </font></font><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">unnamed777:</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> I was sitting in this section only as a </font><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">helper,</font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> I never asked any questions myself. In my eyes, the forum was growing up. When I first read the topics, there were practically no questions about programming, there were questions about services / features / markup. Gradually the contingent began to grow up, and questions about programming began to appear - in php. </font></font><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">unnamed777:</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since I was the most, so to speak, experienced wap-programmer (at that time I was co-administrator of a large wap-site), they listened to me, constantly asked, consulted like a specialist. But when I was tired of answering the same questions, I wrote a FAQ on the basics of PHP, by which many later began their study of the php language. </font></font><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">unnamed777:</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this fact, they forgive people forgiving, a lot of people used it, they even merged it into a separate file, passed it to a friend, placed it on other sites and thanked me :-) In general, it seems to me that I can consider myself one of Ruvap's ‚Äúteachers‚Äù - I did not know in the vapa of a larger forum where vap- (programmers | developers) would sit (I really don‚Äôt like the word wap-master). In February-March 2006, I was appointed moderator of the Vap-Resource Forum and I continued its development not only as a carrier of useful information, but also as a forest nurse. </font></font><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">unnamed777:</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2008 (or 2007, I do not remember) programming was separated from WAP resources into a separate forum, and a little later, when the administration changed, another restructuring took place. As a result, Web resources and Web programming came out of one small forum ‚ÄúVap-resources‚Äù. Unfortunately, due to organizational mistakes of the new administration, the Vap-resources forum has turned into a garbage can, but this is a completely different topic. </font></font><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">[rk]:</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> How do you relate to the current fundamental changes on the forum - "changing the engine" in the form of data transfer to the social. network waper.ru as I understand you do not like? </font></font><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">unnamed777:</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Naturally. Making a generalized quote from the reviews of all the forum moderators, the whole situation can be described as follows: the technical forum was crossed with a kindergarten and makes it ‚Äúhawk.‚Äù Quotes moderators and my full and non-journalistic opinion can be seen in my personal blog. When porting, we were not even warned that we would get into it, it was simply said ‚ÄúThere will be a move, the forum will be temporarily unavailable‚Äù. As a result, our credibility as moderators was undermined, since the users believe that all this was planned by us and we were silent, and the authority of the administration itself, which organized this. Of course, the forum needed development, as it just stood for a while on the spot with all its bugs. But not so drastic. Users must be respected, not indifferent to them.Although in the closed section there is information from the administration (including from DeeSee himself - the father of the C-K forum) that after a while everything will fall into place. But what it will be - an isolated forum with an old design or a more familiar atmosphere, but in a kindergarten team - time will tell</font></font><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">[rk]:</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> You mentioned that you were the soadmin of one of the sites you visited - what was / is this site, what role did you play on it? </font></font><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">unnamed777:</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was wup.ru. I got into it by chance, answering wml questions from its creator in a local forum. Then another site had a different domain (or rather, a subdomain hoster) and it just opened. My role there is a programmer. First, the rules of others are free, then, when I gained experience, I began to write my own, which were sold to other, friendly sites. My most popular script was news with comments and an assessment of the news itself (please do not compare wap and web - these are two completely different communities), which a half or two years ago stood at 70% of wap sites that were not created by designers. Someone bought them, someone did not buy, of which there were most. Not everyone knows who their author was and on which site they originally appeared. In the summer of 2007, I decided to leave the project due to disagreements with its owner.Gradually, the site was dying and now it just costs a paid redirect to the next strawberry. Now I am taking part in the development of two WAP sites, one of which can be called highly visited, and the second one may soon become one :-)</font></font><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">[rk]:</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Let's go back to the beginning of your career as a WAP programmer </font></font><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">[rk]:</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> were there any problems that were characteristic only of WAP? Tell about them briefly. </font></font><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">unnamed777:</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Yes. Since long ago </font></font><strike><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, when dinosaurs lived on the streets</font></font></strike><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">phones went into the wap only with the help of wap-gates - special gateways that compiled the pages into a format understandable to the phone, it was required to write a valid markup. There was still no information in runet about the rules of markup, specifications, etc., for some reason I did not guess to look at foreign sources (I was 16 at the time, I knew English badly). It was necessary to delete all the code on the page one by one and constantly open it on the phone to check operation (if the page was invalid, the gateway couldn‚Äôt compile it, and no one had heard about the validators - surely everyone saw the error of the 502 gateway on OpenWave browsers or similar on other browsers). There were also specific bugs - and gates, and phones. What is only the bug 55-65 series of Siemens when redirecting header ('Location') - they turned off with a peak with such a redirect.</font></font><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">unnamed777:</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Yes, and in itself the creation of a site was difficult then - it was necessary to understand what you are doing, and not like now - go to the site of free scripts, take the script, go to the popular site - take the design. And that's all - the site is ready </font></font><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">[rk]:</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> If you now move away from your projects and look at the wap as a whole - what was it like before, what is it now and what is your future like in your opinion? </font></font><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">unnamed777:</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2003-2005, the wap was a place where you could only get downloads to your phone - ringtones, pictures. Around 2005, various services began to gain popularity - chats, guestbooks, news, stories (libraries). Around the same time, the popularization of paid content began - on every site in the header you could see a link to buy content. Vap began to transform from amateur to commercial activity. The first wap2.0 sites began to appear - color sites with html-tags. When browsers began to work directly with servers without gates, the sites were not made just lazy, because no specific knowledge was required. Now VAP is money for site owners and wide opportunities, often paid, for visitors. This is a serious business, which is now difficult to get into, but it is easy to fly out of it.</font></font><br> <strong>unnamed777:</strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As for the future, the fact that he thought he was not there. Now it is much more correct to call the site mobile, not wap. Further development is easy to predict - the mobile Internet will gradually be mixed with the usual. The difference will be only in the layout and client applications - the faster and cheaper mobile traffic will be, the more powerful and more convenient mobile terminals will be, the more mobile the site will look like a website. If you look at the wap from the point of view of the owner of a profitable portal, then it seems to me that now it is worth developing commercial services, and not just fill the site with content and post links to content providers or alarms (Java applications represented as a game, but actually a midlet,which, when launched, sends a bunch of text messages with orders to the numbers of content providers - a very fast, but very ugly way to make money on the site). For example, sweat video by subscription, browser games, any other services whose ideas can be borrowed from the web.</font></font><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">[rk]:</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Since we have repeatedly touched upon the topic of content providers and earnings, then </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1) How do you feel about the emergence of a large number of sms-content providers </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2) How do you feel about the development of services of buying / selling wap-traffic and services cheat them? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">3) What awaits them all in the future? </font></font><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">unnamed777:</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Choice is always good. Someone offers a greater commission for the purchase of games from Russian operators, someone gives more for the purchase of melodies from the Ukrainian ones. The more competition, the content providers make cooperation ‚Äútastier‚Äù - bonuses, privileges in payments, service. They have a future - they will stop buying content, services will be sold. There is always something that can be sold to the user :-) But this can not be said about the sale of traffic. It is beneficial only to the owners of such sites and arlymschikam - the first because the money goes without much effort, the second ... Actually, the same :-) The site owner who wants to get an audience of visitors, much more reliable to buy ads on the visited site of the desired topic or clicks in banner-exchange systems, although it will be more expensive than the banal buying up of traffic. Guessthat this service sector will be supplanted by contextual advertising systems in the future</font></font><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">unnamed777:</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> And to any services cheating, I am, of course, negative. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Would you be nice if you bought a liter bag of milk, and after payment it was found that there is only half a liter there? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Taking into account the fact that you are not selling this milk, of course :-) </font></font><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">[rk]:</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> What can you tell our reader - a potential WAP developer - goodbye? </font></font><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">unnamed777: </font></font></strong> <strike><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, you do not create govnosay, eh? </font></font></strike><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you want to make a site for money, then first prepare the money, and then the site. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Without a decent investment, nothing will come of it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If the site is for yourself \ for the soul \ for general development - do it, just do not write about this site after creation in all forums and guest pages.</font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Interview with Aryan </font></font></h3><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">[rk]:</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> when and how did you find out about WAP?
