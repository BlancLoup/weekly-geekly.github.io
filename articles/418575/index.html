However, this Japanese habit can be unpleasant for foreigners.  And in 2020, a large number of them will come to the Olympic Games in the Land of the Rising Sun. <br><br>  In Nissin, they set out to solve the problem with a cultural feature by creating a ‚Äúnoise-canceling‚Äù plug.  They were <a href="https://soranews24.com/2017/10/24/nissin-develops-fork-that-covers-up-the-sound-of-slurping-noodles-">inspired by the</a> idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Otohime TOTO device, which is installed in many toilets in Japan and produces artificial loud sounds of drainage. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nKIYKwsPB6o" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The dimensions of the plug are impressive - 4.4 cm (width) and 15.2 cm (length).  A <a href="https://www.upi.com/130-ramen-fork-cancels-out-loud-slurping-sounds/4901508899988/">narrow microphone is built into the</a> thick grip of the device, which captures the sound of sticking.  Then the plug transmits a signal to a mobile phone, and that one reproduces an audio range that masks a potentially unpleasant sound for others.  This audio range can be configured in the app - a choice of simple gray noise, the sound of running water, xylophone, etc. <br><br>  Otohiko could be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/10/24/nissin-cup-noodle-otohiko-ramen-fork/">pre-ordered</a> for about $ 130 in Japan.  However, the device did not go on mass sale - only 5 thousand of such plugs were released.  Now Nissin is <a href="http://nissinfoods.com/stories/introducing-the-first-glasses-specially-designed-to-wear-while-eating-cup-noodles">promoting a</a> new gadget - glasses for eating noodles with a fork on a magnet and a built-in fan from fogging lenses. <br><br><h2>  Microphone for "silent" singing </h2><br>  Another Japanese invention is a gadget for ‚Äúsilent‚Äù karaoke singing Noiseless Karaoke Mic.  A soundproof polymer bowl is <a href="https://www.japantrendshop.com/iphone-ipad-noiseless-usb-karaoke-mic-p-1346.html">put on the</a> microphone, which closes the mouth during the performance of the songs.  The device connects to the iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch through an adapter, to which the headphones also cling.  As planned by the creators of the gadget, singing will be heard only by the performer himself, and not by those around him. <br><br>  The device did not find popularity.  Users <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Karaoke-Noiseless-Microphone-iPhone-smartphone/product-reviews/B00E3OAHH0/ref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr%3FfilterByStar%3Dcritical%26pageNumber%3D1">say</a> it breaks fast.  Also in the network there are <a href="https://www.themarysue.com/noiseless-microphone/">reviews</a> , the authors of which question the ability of the device to muffle loud sounds.  Does not add to the popularity of the gadget and its price tag.  At the start it cost about $ 93, and now on Amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B00E3OAHH0">you can buy it</a> for $ 72. <br><br><h2>  Speaker to send emoji </h2><br>  The small round speaker TeleSound was <a href="https://gajitz.com/sounds-emotional-little-speaker-gives-voice-to-1000-emojis/">conceived</a> as an emoji messenger.  It connects to the smart phone via Bluetooth and voices all the emoji that the user receives in the chat. <br><br>  TeleSound turns on automatically when it is located less than 10 meters from the ‚Äúpaired‚Äù smartphone or tablet.  If the user does not want to be disturbed, he can turn off the device simply by turning it over. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/60440734" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Judging by the campaign on Kickstarter, the creators did not manage to collect the necessary amount of funds to implement the idea.  Of the $ 100 thousand. They scored only $ 14 thousand. The project never saw the light, and the creators shot a "farewell" <a href="https://vimeo.com/62939958">video</a> . <br><br><h2>  Google MediaCare </h2><br>  Gadget Google Nexus Q <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_Q">is</a> a digital media player in the form of a black ball with a <a href="https://www.infoniac.ru/news/Obzor-Nexus-Q-nezavershennyi-misticheskii-shar.html">glowing</a> diode strip.  The device was first introduced in June 2012 at the Google I / O Developer Conference. <br><br>  Nexus Q was created to work with media services of the company, such as Google Play Music, Google Play Movies &amp; TV and YouTube.  Users could stream content from these applications to a TV (via HDMI) or a speaker system (even an amplifier was built into the Nexus Q).  The remote control for the decision of Google was a smartphone or tablet on Android. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mubRc2kP3DA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  After being released to the US market, the project was <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2012/07/31/google-suspends-launch-of-nexus-q-promises-free-q-to-those-who-pre-ordered/">criticized</a> for its low functionality, in particular, it could not work with third-party music streaming applications.  At the same time, the device was quite expensive - $ 300 at the time of launch.  Because of the criticism of the community, the project was quickly turned down, but everyone who pre-ordered Nexus Q <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2012/07/31/google-suspends-launch-of-nexus-q-promises-free-q-to-those-who-pre-ordered/">got the</a> gadget for free. <br><br><h2>  Wireless speaker terminator </h2><br>  Engineers from England have developed a smart speaker, which is made in the shape of the head of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-800_(%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582)">T-800 robots-killers</a> from the Terminator.  The gadget has impressive dimensions - 45 cm in height.  Both ‚Äúeyes‚Äù of the device are lit in red, and the left one is additionally equipped with an HD camera.  Recording is activated automatically after movement sensors trigger or manually.  At the same time, the video is broadcast either to the user's smartphone, or stored in the cloud. <br><br>  The speaker connects via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and using an AUX cable.  The bundle includes Alexa, the AI ‚Äã‚Äãvoice assistant of Amazon.  When connected to a mobile phone using the column, you can make and receive calls. <br><br>  The developers conducted a fundraising company at Kickstarter, but their product was not a success.  It was not possible to collect the required amount, despite the fact that <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/terminator-speaker-with-alexa-absolutely-will-not-stop/">large</a> Internet resources <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazons-alexa-terminator-smart-speaker-kickstarter-campaign-2017-7">were writing</a> about the project. <br><br><h2>  Sony Dancing Player </h2><br>  In 2007, Sony created a digital music robot player and launched it.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Rolly">Sony Rolly</a> fits in the palm of your hand, has 2 GB of internal memory and plays music, spinning to the beat of the melody. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tf/ru/ka/tfrukaemvkyzqsqxiqd_5cuzfqo.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Photo <a href="">Wikimedia</a> <a href="">CC</a></i></font> <br><br>  Sony Rolly can play music from a cell phone, computer or MP3 player.  Before loading songs into the player, a special program Rolly Choreographer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Rolly">analyzes the</a> tracks and creates motion files for the dance.  To store them along with the music track files are used in .mtf format.  However, the player is able to dance with streaming music - without preliminary preparation - but the result is worse. <br><br>  At the start of sales, the player cost $ 399, did not have a display and a headphone jack.  And he never managed to gain popularity.  Now the gadget is no longer sold officially, but it can be <a href="https://www.ebay.com/p/Sony-Rolly-Sep-10bt-White-Sound-Entertainment-Player-Exellent-Japan/2256141398%3Fiid%3D122933724037">found</a> on eBay as a collectible. <br><br><hr><br>  <i>Additional reading:</i> <i><br><br></i> <ul><li>  <a href="https://telegram.me/audiomaniaRU">Microformat - our Telegram channel</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5957.html">6 interesting gadgets for vinyl</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-4731.html">Column-dogs and musical stone</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5884.html">5 places in the world to hear</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5604.html">Weekend reading: 5 books about music and musicians</a> </li></ul><br><hr></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/418575/">https://habr.com/ru/post/418575/</a></p>
