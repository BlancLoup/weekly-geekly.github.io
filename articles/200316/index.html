  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Post good: Samsung continues to develop solar energy to create an autonomous "Digital Village" in Africa</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Habr! <br><br>  Samsung Electronics is known not only for its desire to lead in all areas of home appliances, consumer and commercial electronics and innovative technologies.  For many years, the company has been actively working on global projects within the framework of the social program of corporate responsibility ‚ÄúHope For Children‚Äù.  Last year, we already talked about the good deeds that under the auspices of Samsung were implemented in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/samsung/blog/157747/">South Africa</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/samsung/blog/160859/">Brazil and Vietnam</a> . <br><br>  The concept of an Internet school on solar energy, which was built in the god-forgotten African village of Fomolong last year, was further developed.  A new initiative of the company called Samsung Digital Villages (Digital Villages) will be deployed in South Africa.  Its main goal will be the unification of African settlements, hospitals, schools, lighting systems and energy infrastructure of a single system operating on solar energy.  The project is aimed at improving the quality of health care, providing new educational opportunities and creating conditions in which ordinary people can live an economically independent life.

It should once again be noted that all the project components, without exception, work on solar energy, which the African continent is incredibly rich in. <br><br><h4>  Tele-Medical Center (Tele-Medical Center) </h4><br>  In many regions and remote rural areas of Africa, there is an acute shortage of qualified medical personnel and resources ‚Äî this is hardly to surprise anyone today.  In order to receive adequate medical treatment, local residents often have to go on hours-long trips to the nearest hospitals and clinics. <br><br>  A solar-powered tele-medical center is a mobile container that is designed to provide residents of remote areas and settlements with convenient access to medical services.  In cases when consultation of authoritative colleagues is required, doctors from the Center can activate a video conference with central clinics in the largest cities of the region in real time.  The Center also provides a database and access to a server for storing virtual med.  patient records. <br><br><h4>  Health Center </h4><br>  The health center is a large truck that also provides medical care to local people in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãits location in Digital Village and in surrounding areas.  It is equipped with medical equipment for the treatment of diseases of the eye, ear, nose and throat and dentistry, and also has the capacity for blood analysis and instant diagnosis. <br><br>  High hopes have been placed on the Tele Medical Center and the Health Center: mobile Centers are expected to help successfully overcome geographic and economic barriers in the fight against a multitude of diseases in South Africa, Ethiopia and Gabon. <br><br><h4>  Internet School (Internet School) </h4><br>  Internet school is an oblong metal container capable of independently generating the power necessary for its operation through photovoltaic cells installed on its roof. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/27a/42f/0b7/27a42f0b7c6f0e5bd976b59c1e08b374.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The power of solar panels is enough for the autonomous operation of the facility for three days when fully charged.  This provides uninterrupted power to a large touch screen, which replaces the teacher with a blackboard, and netbooks that students use during multimedia courses, as well as provide Internet access. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2d8/d64/f52/2d8d64f524e489abe4cecdbe20d3ecb6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Solar Generators (Solar Powered Generators) </h4><br>  In addition to the key task - improving the quality of education, medical services and living standards, an equally important aspect of the Digital Villages project is a direct contribution to the development of small enterprises through the introduction of solar energy generators and LED lighting systems.  Due to the fact that the innovative Samsung project operates exclusively on solar energy, the negative impact on the environment is excluded, and operating costs in areas where Digital Villages will be based will be significantly reduced.  The term of work of generators is 7-8 years. <br><br>  Solar generators will provide electricity to homes, schools, hospitals and key municipal premises.  They work silently, do not emit harmful substances into the atmosphere, and the cost of their maintenance is negligible. <br><br><h4>  Further development of the Digital Village project </h4><br>  According to the results of the discussion of the ambitious project with the governments of various African countries, Samsung intends to add police stations and post offices to the Digital Village plan, as well as to focus on the use of satellite communications. <br><br>  This year, Samsung plans to build Digital villages in three countries: South Africa, Ethiopia and Gabon.  Negotiations are underway with other governments and international organizations to expand the project and cover settlements in the most inaccessible areas of the continent. <br><br>  To provide the project with a sufficient number of qualified personnel, Samsung is developing partnerships with medical and educational institutions.  To provide medical services, resources will be attracted from the health authorities of each country that participates in the project, as well as specialists from local universities and the international organization World Vision.  Employees of the Ministry of Education, UNESCO, as well as other governmental and civic organizations will be involved in the implementation of educational programs. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/200316/">https://habr.com/ru/post/200316/</a></p>
