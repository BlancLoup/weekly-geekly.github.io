      <b>"General Information"</b> .  We chose the top-8 cryptocurrency available for mining by capitalization.  For each of them, they compiled a list of the largest pools in terms of production - 9 for Bitcoin and 3 each for the other currencies. <br><br>  <b>"Technical characteristics of Bitcoin pools"</b> and <b>"Technical characteristics of other pools"</b> .  They identified a list of important criteria for miners - hash rate, distribution and size of commissions, clarity and stability of the service, and others.  Collected this information for selected pools. <br><br>  <b>"Community"</b> .  Found information about the social component of pools - who most often visits their sites, from which users of countries, how often they share information about the pool, and so on. <br><br>  <i>For a detailed study of the mining pools worth exploring the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O0-knVO__5VzIyJiEAP56TfyDz7b0lIiJowHlcRN6sU/edit%3Fusp%3Dsharing">table</a> .</i>  <i>To understand the selection process, it is better to read the text below.</i> <br><br><h3>  Step-by-step explanation of the work done </h3><br><br>  Step 1. Chose the top 8 cryptocurrency capitalization with <a href="http://coinmarketcap.com/coins">Coinmarketcap</a> .  At the time of this writing (11/17/2017), this list included Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dash, Monero, Ripple, IOTA.  Of these, only the first six are mined, since they support the Proof-of-Work algorithm.  Read more about it <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/263769/">in the article on Habrahabr</a> . <br><br>  Step 2. Compiled a general list of mining pools for these currencies and sorted it in descending order of production.  For bitcoin, we chose top 9 for analysis - the pool on the 10th place is constantly changing.  For Bitcoin Cash we considered top-4 pools, and for other currencies - top-3.  Information sources: <br><br>  <b>Bitcoin:</b> <a href="https://btc.com/">https://btc.com</a> <br><br>  <b>Ethereum:</b> <a href="https://www.etherchain.org/statistics/miners">https://www.etherchain.org/statistics/miners</a> <br><br>  <b>Bitcoin Cash:</b> <a href="https://cash.coin.dance/blocks/thisweek">https://cash.coin.dance/blocks/thisweek</a> <br><br>  <b>Litecoin:</b> <a href="https://www.litecoinpool.org/pools">https://www.litecoinpool.org/pools</a> <br><br>  <b>Dash:</b> <a href="https://chainz.cryptoid.info/dash/">https://chainz.cryptoid.info/dash/##extraction</a> <br><br>  <b>Monero</b> : <a href="https://moneropools.com/">https://moneropools.com</a> <br><br>  <b>Step 3.</b> For each pool collected general information.  This name, site, link to rating, list of supported cryptocurrencies, year of foundation (start of the site), owner of the pool.  <i>The results on the sheet "General Information" in the table.</i> <br><br>  <b>Step 4.</b> Analyzed what miners pay attention to when choosing.  We chose six parameters: <br><br>  <b>Supported currencies.</b>  The pool must mine the selected cryptocurrency. <br><br>  <b>Pool type</b>  Some pools mine one cryptocurrency, others several at once.  If these currencies use similar Proof-of-Work algorithms, then the pool can switch the mining to the most profitable mining capacity at the moment. <br><br>  <b>Withheld commission</b>  The lower the better. <br><br>  <b>Convenience control of farms.</b>  The ability to track the effectiveness of each individual miner, API access, the presence of a correct interface translation. <br><br>  <b>Payments.</b>  Frequency, the ability to manually adjust, the presence of automatic conversion. <br><br>  <b>Reputation.</b>  Payment stability and stability of the pool.  For example, the pool with less <a href="http://www.internet-technologies.ru/articles/article_2255.html">ping is more</a> stable. <br><br>  <b>Step 5. We</b> found out that the commissions in the mining pools consist of: commissions for the found block and other additional fees - for example, for transferring the payment to the client‚Äôs wallet. <br><br>  At the same time, there are 7 types of accrual of profit (reward) in mining pools.  You can read about each in the <a href="https://in-trend.biz/wiki/krypto/prop/">cryptocurrency encyclopedia</a> .  Most used species: <br><br>  <b>Proportional.</b>  After finding a block pool, the reward is divided in proportion to the contribution of each participant. <br><br>  <b>Pps.</b>  Every sent number is rewarded.  Estimated as current reward per block divided by current difficulty. <br><br>  <b>Score.</b>  The estimated reward system of the found number, the algorithm is determined by the pool organizer. <br><br>  <b>PPLNS.</b>  Similar to Proportional, but the division of the reward is proportional to the contribution to the complexity of the last found numbers multiplied by N, where N is usually 2. <br><br>  <i><b># interesting The</b></i> secret rule of miners is the choice of not too large pools due to the risk of ‚Äúattack 51%‚Äù - capturing more than 50% of blocks of cryptocurrency by one mining pool.  In this situation, the dominant player gets the opportunity to selectively skip certain transactions, so the confidence in the currency falls.  As a result, it depreciates.  More information about this can be found on <a href="https://ru.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_51%2525">BitcoinWiki</a> and <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/kaspersky/blog/337410/">in the article on Habrahabr</a> . <br><br>  <b>Step 6.</b> Based on the <b>4th and 5th steps, we</b> identified important technical parameters: the frequency of payments, the method of distributing the mining reward, the transaction fee, additional fees, auto withdrawal, feedback on the work with the pool, understandability of the site and the convenience of working with it. <br><br>  For mining pools, Bitcoin additionally analyzed the stability of work, the proportion of unreclassified blocks, the number of errors in the calculation of the reward and the removal of the commission.  <i>The results on the sheets ‚ÄúBitcoin pools technical characteristics‚Äù and ‚ÄúOther pools technical characteristics‚Äù sheets in the table.</i> <br><br>  <b>Step 7.</b> Evaluated the marketing component.  Selected eight parameters: <br><br>  <b>Sociology.</b>  The number of visitors to the site over the past month, the country where they come from, and their interests. <br><br>  <b>Transitions.</b>  Sources of transitions, traffic from social networks. <br><br>  <b>Mention.</b>  The total number of available referral links to the pool, the number of requests in search services for which the site is on the 1st place, as well as reviews. <br><br>  Information was taken from the official sites of the mining pools, from the <a href="http://bitcointalk.org/">bitcointalk.org</a> forums and also with the help of the services <a href="http://similarweb.com/">similarweb.com</a> , <a href="http://spywords.ru/">spywords.ru</a> , <a href="http://buzzsumo.com/">buzzsumo.com</a> , <a href="http://semrush.com/">semrush.com</a> .  <i>Results on the ‚ÄúCommunity‚Äù sheet in the table.</i> <br><br>  <b>Step 8</b> .  Analyzed and revealed the main patterns in the considered pools.  <i>The results are described in the conclusions of this article.</i> <br><br><h2>  Brief description of selected mining pools </h2><br><h3>  Pools that mine BTC (Bitcoin) </h3><br><br>  <b>Antpool</b> <br>  Chinese mining pool.
