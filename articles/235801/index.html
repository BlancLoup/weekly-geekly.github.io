But from the totality of rumors and leaks to the network, it can be judged that today will be presented: <br><br><h2>  New iPhone 6 </h2><br>  The predecessors in the face of the iPhone 5 / 5s have served the required two years, so it's time to update the range of smartphones from Apple.  It is expected that two new iPhones will be presented, differing primarily in screen diagonal: 4.7 (iPhone 6) and 5.5 (iPhone 6 Plus) inches, respectively (the 5 / 5S now has a 4-inch display and even once called it a giant).

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd6/f76/9ff/cd6f769ffded4c949f87ee39efb3cefb.jpg"><br><br>  There are a lot of renders of new iPhones, models printed on 3D-printers, prototypes and other ‚Äúofficial iPhones with two SIM cards‚Äù, but before the official announcement I don‚Äôt want to draw any conclusions.  And according to rumors, we are waiting for a metal case with rounded corners, sapphire glass (on older models), an integrated NFC module, an 8-megapixel camera (with optical stabilization), a model with 128 GB of memory and a new iOS 8 on board. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e2f/b99/b4b/e2fb99b4b62e4ea19d429b0fda6ec775.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df5/205/ec2/df5205ec26e94c568de40dca77f2cdef.jpg"><br><br>  New items are expected to be on sale on September 19. <br><br><h2>  IWatch watch </h2><br>  As one famous designer said recently, ‚Äú <i>Switzerland has problems</i> .‚Äù  It is clear that it was not about the whole country, but only about the Swiss horse-humpback: hours.  Everything would be fine if these words were not from Apple designer, Johnny Quince. <br><br>  Therefore, it is possible to breathe out with relief - most likely, it is precisely today that numerous posts will cease to appear with rumors about fruit watches, which at the moment everyone calls iWatch.  Indeed, it seems a little strange that now almost every self-respecting brand, not to mention the second and third echelons, has a smart watch (or some other wearable bracelet-type gadget).  But Apple has not delivered them yet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff9/b10/b95/ff9b10b95c97456f8e41c9d0db8da84d.jpg"><br><br>  Knowing the marketers of the apple company, maybe they will be able to actually substantiate the need for a gadget of this kind for each consumer and make those who do not have an iWatch feel something deprived.  At least, that‚Äôs how it used to be with the iPhone ( <i>pff, yes, he‚Äôs without buttons, he‚Äôsn‚Äôt even able to play games on him</i> ) and the iPad ( <i>and who needs it ‚Äî he already has an iPhone, and he still won‚Äôt replace the laptop</i> ) - but Now these gadgets are almost in every family. <br><br>  In principle, the presentation of the three devices already mentioned above could take the allotted time, but without additional products, the happiness of the company's fans would be incomplete.  There is no specificity in this question, so I will list the possible options. <br><br>  May present: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Apple's payment system</b> <br><br>  There are several prerequisites on the basis of which it can be concluded that Apple is preparing its own payment system.  At least, the noble ground for it seems to be about to appear: iPhone 6 with the NFC module, providing iOS 8 to third-party applications with access to TouchID, a collective chat in Skype of Apple employees and representatives of payment systems such as Visa, American Express and MasterCard ... In short, there is no smoke without fire. <br><br>  Will this theory be confirmed - we will find out in a few hours. <br><br></li><li>  <b>New iPad Air 2 and iPad mini Retina 2</b> <br><br>  It is possible that the update will affect the company's tablets - at least, it would be time.  According to rumors, the new iPad Air (the ‚Äú2‚Äù will be added to the model name) will have onboard an TouchID sensor, which is run in to the iPhone, as well as a new camera and A8 processor.  The younger brother in the face of the iPad Mini Retina 2 can get the same innovations.  And maybe not get it - here, as in a joke about a dinosaur, 50/50. </li></ul><br>  Well, in conclusion: it is unlikely today will do without the announcement and the exact date of release of the new version of iOS 8, the beta version of which has long been available to developers.  The same goes for the new OS X Yosemite, the new version of the operating system for Apple's ‚Äúadult‚Äù devices.  In the meantime, the site has only the line ‚ÄúThis Fall‚Äù - most likely, this is not about September 9th. <br><br>  The presentation will be broadcast on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/live/">official website</a> .  Nevertheless, I want to keep the tradition and make a text version of the presentation, so that there is something to discuss, looking at the pictures. <br><br>  If there are a lot of comments under this publication at the beginning of the announcement, then a separate page will be created for the broadcast - so that you can discuss directly what was announced. <br><br>  What do you expect from the presentation? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/235801/">https://habr.com/ru/post/235801/</a></p>
