  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Xperia E4 Review</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  What are the requirements for users of a budget smartphone?  In addition to price, as a rule, the most important criteria are durability, reliability, autonomy and high-quality communication.  The screen and the camera, in such cases, are on the sidelines, as well as powerful hardware, but it is always nice when, for the same money, you can get an IPS-matrix, and very decent performance.  The next available smartphone Xperia E4 is just from this category. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/842/9e3/882/8429e38822474a9384053240058c6ab4.JPG"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Appearance and ergonomics</b> <br><br>  The design of the device will appeal to those who are nostalgic for the times of the Xperia ZR - the case, in modern times, is quite compact, with strongly rounded edges.  A very interesting design technique can be called a prominent frame of the screen.  Actually, the phone is ‚Äúinserted‚Äù into the massive back cover - a similar design could be observed in the last year‚Äôs ‚Äúbudget‚Äù Xperia C, with which our today's hero is related and the MediaTek chipset.  The design provides a "hot" replacement of SIM-cards, and also allows you to minimize the number of external connectors, of which there are only two "on the surface" - micro USB and 3.5-audio.  This model does not have water protection, so no plugs are required on the connectors.  To remove the cover, just press your fingernail on one of the corners.  Despite the simplicity, the design is very durable and reliable, the main module does not leave its place even after falling on a hard surface, and thick plastic protects the corners of the screen - the most vulnerable spot - from impacts.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/343/f98/be4/343f98be451b407c916b0618438e2617.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c4/219/d3b/4c4219d3b71a47ca99489121b92e464e.JPG"><br><br>  The layout is quite familiar and continues the tradition of OmniBalance: a large round power button on the right side (ideally fits under the thumb), a volume rocker slightly lower, and decided to do without a separate button to start the camera.  On the front panel there are symmetrical slits for the microphone, the earpiece and the peephole of the front camera, and on the back cover you can find the main camera lens, LED flash and external speaker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2cb/df0/7ce/2cbdf07ced2f426ea0357cfdb746c88e.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf9/d84/a9f/cf9d84a9fc2e4d019024d621d211b41a.JPG"><br><br>  <b>Screen</b> <br><br>  Despite the not very high resolution (960x540) in our times, there is no way to complain about the picture quality.  The IPS-matrix provides excellent viewing angles (brightness and saturation does not change even at maximum tilt), and very convincing color reproduction.  Pixelateing is noticeable only if you gaze at it intently and try to notice it specifically (well, or when reading too small text, which, however, is easier to enlarge than to try to consider).  The image density of 220 ppi for a budget device can be considered very decent! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aed/396/017/aed3960172e7427eb4f3c3996764e92b.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fab/c68/7f0/fabc687f06e7480985709ffc181cac5e.JPG"><br><br>  The screen behaves well even in bright light, the sensor works adequately and quickly adjusts the brightness in accordance with the situation, but this function, of course, can be turned off and set the required level manually.  The factory film on the screen from last year is not even on the flagship models, but there is an oleophobic coating that does an excellent job.  The maximum number of simultaneous touches supported by the sensor is five, it works clearly and responsively, does not imagine wrong touches, but reacts to conscious ones as expected. <br><br>  <b>Camera</b> <br><br>  Standard for budget devices from Sony modest 5 MP Exmor RS camera copes with its task quite well, especially with good lighting.  Relying on the automatic mode is far from always, but with manual settings (as usual, you can adjust the exposure, white balance, focus mode, HDR, etc.) it is quite possible to get very decent shots.  They no longer save on the front camera: now it is 2 megapixel, quite suitable for both video chats and self portraits.  Examples of pictures, as usual, are attached. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/05f/d6e/76f/05fd6e76f46d438b933d38f927e763b3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/042/f74/888/042f7488854149ee98315484996acf7b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c33/ed3/251/c33ed32518f644c4aad529842f26a0d6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c3/ef8/f73/4c3ef8f738c5434880d1eb9361169899.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/393/bdc/c50/393bdcc50b8944baa3437054bf3b28c0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/154/8b5/0de/1548b50de6974a1298a00250bfd5da04.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Performance</b> <br><br>  The quad-core system on the MediaTek MT6582 chip perfectly copes with any day-to-day tasks, be it watching videos, surfing the web, playing games or reading.  The brakes are not observed either in the shell or in third-party applications - modern demanding 3D games with quite complex graphics work quite well.  The phone is very resistant to overheating, and even demanding operations practically do not change its temperature.  Compared with the previous model in this segment - E3, there was an increase in the amount of internal storage.  Now it is 8 GB and can be expanded by installing an SD card up to 64 GB.  In tests E4, compared with its predecessor, showed a slight increase, after all the main changes were made not on the iron, but on the display.  The results of synthetic tests can be found below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a1d/ef7/3c7/a1def73c7de94c908be9af4bb1c5b133.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Multimedia</b> <br><br>  The strength of the younger Sony models is traditionally considered to be sound, the E-series smartphones are equipped with high-quality and powerful speakers that allow you to use them as a sound source at small parties.  Of course, the pumping bass cannot be extracted from the phone (a Bluetooth speaker will be needed here), but the sound is nevertheless clear and legible at that volume level, where other similar devices already have pronounced distortion.  For a particularly sociable music lovers, there is a Party Share feature that allows you to quickly share media files on your device with other party members.  There are no complaints about the sound in the headphones, it is clear, legible and with a good volume margin. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f7/7d1/063/1f77d10632314db0986dabcf669b9dc0.JPG"><br><br>  <b>Autonomy</b> <br><br>  The battery, compared with last year, has not changed.  Its capacity is still 2300 mAh, which is more than enough for such a not very energy-intensive device.  Operating time in the STAMINA mode with intensive use is about two days, and when the Ultra STAMINA power saving mode is on, the life from one charge can be extended up to four days.  Like good old times. <br><br>  <b>Connection</b> <br><br>  E4g supports work in LTE networks, and Xperia E4 has an option with two SIM-cards - E4 dual.  The choice between two SIM cards can be done, depending on the desire, once (for example, automatically using one for calls and the other for the Internet), or, if necessary, choose again each time.  The connection is confident, it does not try to disappear even in problem areas and this applies both to telephone calls and mobile Internet.  With GPS / GLONASS navigation, there are also no problems, as, indeed, with other models - geolocation works extremely accurately and quickly, even on the street, even indoors. <br><br>  <b>findings</b> <br><br>  A great opportunity to get for very little money a very productive smartphone with LTE, a large screen, an IPS-matrix, a capacious battery, well-optimized power consumption, a loud sound and a nice design.  Unpretentious and reliable device that certainly will not fail. <br><br>  <b>Characteristics</b> : <br><br>  <b>Processor</b> : MediaTek MT6582 1.3 GHz <br>  <b>Video</b> : Mali-T400MP2 <br>  <b>Memory</b> : 1 GB RAM, 8 GB internal, SD card slot <br>  <b>Display</b> : 5 inches, IPS, 960x540 <br>  <b>Camera</b> : 5 megapixel (main), 2 megapixel (front) <br>  <b>Battery</b> : 2300 mAh <br>  <b>OS</b> : Android 4.4 <br>  <b>Protection</b> : no </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/379837/">https://habr.com/ru/post/379837/</a></p>
