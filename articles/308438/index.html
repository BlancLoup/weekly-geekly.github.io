The first downloads started, and now is the time to start removing metrics in order to analyze them and identify possible weak points.  Analytics - the most important tool in the world of mobile applications.  It allows you to understand the psychology of the user, to understand how he interacts with the mobile application, and as a result will help make your child better and more profitable. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There can be a lot of metrics, and usually their set depends on the specific application.  But there are a number of key indicators that need to be monitored, regardless of the nature and scale of your project.  These include: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Application installation source</b> : information about where the user learned about your application; </li><li>  <b>User retention</b> : how many people launched your application a different number of days after installation; </li><li>  <b>The number of unique users</b> : how many people use your application during the day, week and month, how regularly they do it; </li><li>  <b>Session</b> : the duration of interaction with the application, which application screens the user visited, when and how the session was completed; </li><li>  <b>Interaction with the interface</b> : which buttons and in what sequence were pressed, A / B tests, etc .; </li><li>  <b>Finance</b> : if your application uses paid content, it is critical to know what percentage of users decide to fork out, how often they do it, what is the average profit per user, how much money the project brings to you, whether it is profitable or unprofitable. </li></ul><br>  Let's look at each item in more detail.

    <h3>  Application Installation Source </h3><br>  A very important metric that allows you to understand the effectiveness of a particular advertising channel.  You can simply track the advertising channel, the principle is the same as in the case of the transition to the website: in the link leading to the app store, special labels are inserted that are unique to each of the advertising channels.  After installation, the application reads these tags and records the source.  Further, this source is displayed in the analytics system that you use. <br><br><h3>  User retention </h3><br>  It uses a variety of metrics.  After the user has installed and launched the application, he assesses whether he likes it.  If not, he will immediately remove it or close it and forget it.  But if the application was like, then after a while the person will launch it again. <br><br>  To assess user appeal, metrics are most often removed: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>1-day retention</b> .  Metric means the percentage of users (%) who opened your application the day after installation.  That is, the number of those who are so interested in your product that they returned to it very quickly.  The low value of this indicator indicates that something does not suit users in your application.  Most often, a bad ‚Äú1-day retention‚Äù talks about problems with the interface: it can be inconvenient and / or incomprehensible, this is the first thing you need to do to correct the situation.  After all, if the user does not return the next day, then with a high probability will not return at all.  So increasing the value of this metric is one of the most important tasks after the application is laid out. <br><br>  Calculated by the formula: <br><br>  1DR = X <sub>1</sub> / Z, where X <sub>1</sub> is the number of users who launched the application the next day, Z is the total number of installs. <br><br></li><li>  <b>7-day retention</b> .  Percentage of users returning a week after installation.  If this figure is lower than ‚Äú1-day retention,‚Äù then it's time to sit down and analyze what users may not arrange after a longer, weekly familiarity with the application.  It may be worth revising the approach to <abbr title="Custom Scripts">use cases</abbr> . <br><br>  Calculated by the formula: <br><br>  7DR = X <sub>7</sub> / Z, where X <sub>7</sub> is the number of users running the application on the seventh day, Z is the total number of installs. <br><br></li><li>  <b>28-day retention</b> .  The share of those who used the application on the 28th day after installation.  If even a month later people return to your product, then it means that he ‚Äúhooked‚Äù them.  A decrease in the value of this metric compared with the previous one indicates some deep, implicit, strategic flaws. <br><br>  Calculated by the formula: <br><br>  28DR = X <sub>28</sub> / Z, where X <sub>28</sub> is the number of users who launched the application on the seventh day, Z is the total number of installs. </li></ul><br>  All three metrics are removed daily, each time the application starts, the current date and the date of installation are compared.  Analysis of the dynamics of changes in each of the metrics will also allow you to understand the reaction of users to certain changes you make to the application.  For example, a 1-day retention level usually indicates how users react to your application interface.  And if this indicator began to decline, then first of all it is necessary to check what is wrong with the interface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f4/1c8/98a/0f41c898abdc44c68a0346f826a49887.png"><br><br>  The next important daily metric is the <b>increase in the number of new users</b> .  Moreover, it is recommended to monitor the change of this parameter when conducting advertising campaigns, placing review articles, entering into partnership agreements, etc.  In this case, the metric acts as the effectiveness of all these movements.  It is advisable to impose on the graph of the number of new users not only dates, but also installation time, which will help to more accurately assess the role of the promotion and advertising measures you take.  It is also often useful to evaluate the dynamics depending on the geographical separation of users, as well as separately for different user segments. <br><br>  If the dynamics of growth will be negative, then you need to actively engage in promotion and advertising.  We will tell more about this in a future publication. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5a2/d6d/f04/5a2d6df04bb24b4a89a2ee21eb0b359d.png"><br><br><h3>  The number of unique users during a certain period </h3><br>  So, you managed to achieve a more or less sustainable growth of the audience, the project is warmly received by users and is gaining popularity.  It's time to think about the degree of user activity: how many people launch your application per day?  And a week?  Per month?  And we are talking about unique users.  Three metrics answer these questions: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>DAU (Daily Active Users)</b> : The number of unique users per day. </li><li>  <b>WAU (Weekly Active Users)</b> : The number of unique users per week.  Do not try to get this metric, adding up seven different DAUs - you will inevitably find several times those users who ran the application more than once during the week. </li><li>  <b>MAU (Monthly Active Users)</b> : the number of unique users per month.  The warning is the same as with DAU - it is not the sum of smaller metrics, but an independently measured parameter. </li></ul><br>  In essence, each of these metrics is computed from one common database, in which statistics is accumulated for all application launches.  The uniqueness of users can be determined, for example, by assigned ID or login / password pairs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d13/3ec/860/d133ec860d7e4b5a8e7eabef23bc1ab5.png"><br><br>  You can also calculate the derived <b>Sticky Factor</b> metric = DAU / WAU or DAU / MAU.  Its name can be translated as ‚Äúdegree of stickiness‚Äù.  It describes the <b>regular use of</b> your application during the week or month, that is, it allows you to assess how much people like your application based on the frequency of use.  If all users run the program every day, then DAU will be equal to WAU and MAU, and their ratio will be 100%.  But this does not happen, and therefore Sticky Factor allows you to assess how often people access your application during a week or a month.  It is logical that the decline in these indicators - an unpleasant signal, talking about the cooling of the audience. <br><br><h3>  Session </h3><br>  A session is the time that a user spent in a mobile application from the moment of launch until the end of its use.  In relation to sessions, two metrics are usually removed: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>The total number of sessions per period</b> . </li><li>  <b>Average Session Length (ASL)</b> : arithmetic average of all session lengths over a certain time interval.  Calculated by the formula: <br><br>  ASL = T / N, where T is the total duration of sessions for the period, N is the total number of sessions for the same period. <br><br>  This metric may indicate how interesting the user is to spend time in the application.  That is, it is an indirect criterion of quality.  In addition, if your application has paid content, but with an increase in the average session duration, the probability that the user decides to pay also increases.  In most projects, paying users spend more time in the application than non-paying ones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/67f/086/466/67f0864662934ae3a5a7e876046e6dda.png"></li></ul><br>  However, you should not chase after the high values ‚Äã‚Äãof this metric, because it strongly depends on the type of your application.  For example, for games, this indicator is quite critical, and the more it is, the better.  And for applications, widgets or fitness trackers, this figure will be insignificant, since for the most part they work in the background.  It is much more important to know <b>which screens the</b> user visited <b>during the session</b> .  Thanks to this metric, you can determine the sections of your application that are most interesting to users.  And at the same time, you will find out which ones can be completely removed and not to be engaged in their development in the future. <br><br>  A very useful metric is <b>on which screen the user session ends</b> .  This indicator is important, for example, if you have authorization in the application.  It often discourages users, especially if the application does not allow viewing content, but first requires a login and password.  In this case, the session will most often terminate on the registration screen.  If you add some content before logging in, then thanks to this metric you will immediately see the result. <br><br>  Another example: if you have a product order form consisting of 3-4 screens, then this metric will show at which step most users leave the application.  As a solution, reduce the number of steps, optimize their order or design. <br><br><h3>  Interactions with interface elements </h3><br>  Trying to raise the values ‚Äã‚Äãof certain metrics, very often you have to adjust the user interface and change the functionality of the program.  You can evaluate the effectiveness of these steps using <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B-%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">A / B testing</a> (real-time testing, when a group of users is offered one version of the functionality / content, and the rest of the users are offered a different version).  In our case, testing implies rolling out a new version of the application with a modified UI for some control group of users.  The rest continue to use the current version.  And we register how the control group reacts to innovations by removing interaction metrics with the application interface: for example, which of the two buttons gives a higher purchase conversion, where better to show the <abbr title="pop-up window">popup</abbr> asking for feedback about the application, etc.  You can also use third-party services for A / B testing, for example, <a href="https://apptimize.com/">Apptimize</a> , <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/">Optimizely</a> , <a href="https://mixpanel.com/">Mixpanel</a> . <br><br>  With the help of collected statistics, you can also find out how much this or that application's functions are in demand, how many users interact with the application without connecting to the network, and much more. <br><br><h3>  Finance </h3><br>  This is one of the most interesting and important groups of metrics.  If you plan to make money with your application, then you need to pay close attention to registering these metrics and controlling the dynamics of their change. <br><br>  The first thing that comes to mind is the <b>total amount of payments for the period, Gross</b> .  However, keep in mind that this is a gross income, from which you still have to subtract the share of the store through which you distribute the application.  But after deduction, we get the <b>Revenue</b> metric, which reflects the amount credited to your account. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f9a/af5/dd0/f9aaf5dd0c0a45acb2643c1574834e94.png"><br><br>  Suppose your application itself is free, but some of the content is available only for money - you distribute it in in-app purchases.  To develop the application and increase revenue, we need to know <b>how many unique users are paid during a given period</b> .  For example, how many people bought game tokens, golden shells, more powerful spells, access to advanced analytics, beautiful design or other paid delicacies offered by you per month. <br><br>  The following metric is derived from the previous one: <b>what proportion are the payers of the total number of unique users</b> (for the period) <b>Paying Share</b> .  Our unattainable ideal is 100%.  Although in reality everything is usually much more modest.  If this indicator starts to fall, then users are already fed up with the existing paid content, and it is time to either diversify it or play with discounts.  On the last point there are many different tactics.  For example, you can give discounts on weekends and on holidays.  You can create a stir, temporarily bringing prices down, and as soon as the number of downloads increases significantly, return the prices back to their previous level.  You can give discounts on coupons, you can offer to perform some simple quest.  Another option: "the first discount of 5,000 people who downloaded Ivan Kupala on the night of".  If there are other applications with paid content in your portfolio, you can use package discounts when downloading two or more of your products.  In general, there are quite a few options for using discounts. <br><br>  In addition to the number of taxpayers, we are also interested in the <b>specific number of payments per user, Transactions by User</b> .  This metric is calculated by the formula: <br><br>  TBU = T / PU, where T is the total number of payments (transactions) for a certain period, PU (paying users) is the total number of payers for the same period. <br><br>  If TBU&gt; 1, then some users made more than one purchase. <br><br>  The following important ARPU and ARPPU metrics are: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)</b> : the average profit per user for the period.  Calculated by the formula: <br><br>  ARPU = Gross / DAU, or Gross / WAU, or Gross / MAU. <br><br>  Please note that this metric handles the entire audience of your application, that is, it is a kind of assessment of the effectiveness of the entire project.  Its value is influenced, first of all, by the attractiveness to users of the pricing policy of your application. </li><li>  <b>ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paying User)</b> : average profit per payer per period.  Calculated by the formula: <br><br>  ARPPU = Gross / PU, where PU is the total number of unique users who paid for content in the application over a period of time. <br><br>  This metric allows you to estimate the specific profitability of this segment of your audience.  And the dynamics of ARPPU changes gives us a signal about the attitude of payers to the prices / quality of paid content.  For example, a decrease in prices will lead to a decrease in ARPPU, but it may raise ARPU, as some of the users who were not satisfied with the price level may start buying.  As a result, the efficiency of the project as a whole will increase.  Still, this is not the best scenario, where it is better to achieve the growth of both of these metrics simultaneously.  Say, by increasing the interest of the audience with the help of new or better content without lowering prices. <br><br>  Change dependency Paying Share and ARPPU: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/159/5b2/1a9/1595b21a9c69458a8d05d2eb4c07a3d5.png"></li></ul><br>  Speaking about the profit received from users, we should not forget about how much their attraction costs us.  In the end, the first must be greater than the second, otherwise what is the point in all this?  As a metric, the <b>cost of one application installation (CPI, Cost per Install) is used here</b> .  Calculated by the formula: <br><br>  CPI = A / I, where A is the cost of advertising, promotion and marketing, I is the number of application installations. <br><br>  This metric can be calculated both for the entire lifetime of the project, calculating the current cost of attracting the user, and for certain periods, determining the effectiveness of specific advertising campaigns or measures to promote the application. <br><br>  And we conclude our review with the <b>LTV (Lifetime Value)</b> metric - this is the specific user profitability throughout the entire period of using the application.  There are many ways to calculate LTV, but first you can use the following formula: <br><br>  LTV = ARPU * Lifetime, where Lifetime is the average duration of using the application from the first launch to the last.  For example, if a user first entered the application on January 1, and the last time - on August 15 and did not use them anymore, then for him Lifetime is 7.5 months.  By summing Lifetime for all users and dividing them by their total number, we get the average value of this metric, which will be used to calculate LTV. <br><br>  Note that when calculating LTV, the Lifetime multiplier should be a multiple of the period for which the ARPU is calculated.  If you took ARPU for a month, then Lifetime will be measured in months, not days or weeks.  Let's say if your application has a monthly ARPU of $ 5, and Lifetime is 3 months, then LTV = $ 5 * 3 = $ 15. <br><br>  This metric is one of the key parameters for evaluating the effectiveness of your project.  If LTV is less than CPI, then the project is unprofitable without any ‚Äúif‚Äù and ‚Äúlet's take a different look‚Äù: you spent more on attracting the user than you received from him for all the time that he used your application.  Therefore, LTV must be constantly monitored and immediately respond to the downward trend of this metric.  Obviously, you can increase LTV using one or both multipliers, achieving an increase in the average profit per user per period and / or an increase in the average duration of use of the application.  For example, you can reduce the outflow of users, increasing the attractiveness of the application;  reduce borrowing costs by choosing more efficient channels;  increase the cost of purchases by raising prices and stimulating the need for paid content. <br><br>  Finally, we want to give an example of metrics for two popular games: Mobile Strike and Clash of Clans.  The summary data on versions for Android and iOS in the USA are given.  If you make mobile games, you can focus on their metrics, as on the top products in this class of applications: <br><br><ul><li>  Number of downloads: 30-50 thousand per day </li><li>  Weekly number of unique active users (WAU): 1.2-7 million. </li><li>  Daily / Weekly Active User Ratio (DAU / WAU): 30-60% </li><li>  Daily profit: 800 thousand - 2 million dollars </li></ul><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">More in the screenshots</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Number of downloads: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a85/53a/077/a8553a0774a147eea6e7a76fb3ad1a24.png"><br><br>  Weekly number of unique active users (WAU): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ba3/542/7c9/ba35427c99f54b76bf73fb8c2ded5f63.png"><br><br>  Ratio of daily and weekly active users (DAU / WAU): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a8a/13c/e81/a8a13ce81af2477c87428850d4c2939b.png"><br><br>  Daily Profit: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fe4/e7a/9bd/fe4e7a9bd7bc4eb2a613b7096cbfca6e.png"><br></div></div><br>  The matrix of two indicators - 30-day retention and frequency of use per week - for different categories of applications according to the Flurry analytics system: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/966/c9b/5ad/966c9b5ada4d49838ac826d7349465ad.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/14f/f1a/b84/14ff1ab84a8543faa0b478898eb15cac.jpg"><br><br><h3>  About analytics systems </h3><br>  There are quite a lot of them, but <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> , <a href="https://dev.flurry.com/secure/loginPage.do">Flurry</a> and <a href="https://www.appannie.com/">App Annie are the</a> most popular among mobile application developers.

For individual developers and small studios, it is vital to keep abreast of their projects, nurture them and immediately react to negative signals, manifested in the deterioration of metrics when the project starts and global milestones every hour. <br><br>  The described analytics systems are only part of the arsenal of tools that facilitate the work of many studios and independent developers.  Today, the creation of successful applications requires the acceleration of the development process, the use of convenient and functional tools.  Based on this, we are developing Scorocode, turning it into a useful, and for someone, an indispensable tool for developing mobile applications. <br><br>  Good luck to you development and high revenue. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/308438/">https://habr.com/ru/post/308438/</a></p>
