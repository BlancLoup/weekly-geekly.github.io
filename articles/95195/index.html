The service is intended for those who want to conduct video broadcasting on their sites, designed for a mass audience, but at the same time does not want to pay for the traffic generated by such broadcasts.  The service can be used to broadcast video in all popular formats - in particular, Flash, WMV and Silverlight are supported. <br><br><img src="http://www.p2pvideo.ru/images/p2pvideo-1.jpg" alt="image">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  As you know, to conduct massive online video broadcast over the Internet is not a trivial task.  Even if you rely on an audience of over a thousand users, you need to purchase or rent a large number of servers, arrange for their placement with Internet service providers, learn how to work with software for streaming broadcasting, and only after that you can proceed to the broadcast organization itself.  You can, of course, outsource all the above tasks for outsourcing and buy the service from a CDN network provider, but then you will have to pay traffic for each gigabyte transferred, which is not cheap at regular CDNs. <br><br><h4>  P2P broadcast: cheap and high quality </h4><br><br>  We have worked long and hard, and now we present to your court a service for P2P broadcasts, which can be an alternative to the 2nd previously mentioned methods of organizing video broadcasting on the Internet.  In P2P broadcasts, users will transmit video streams to each other, and the central servers of the system are used to route traffic between P2P clients and are practically not used to distribute the video streams themselves.  Thus, our service allows you to save on traffic during video broadcasting and, as a result, to provide extremely attractive prices for organizing mass video broadcasting to our customers. <br><br>  With P2P broadcasts, the user receives video streams from several peers at once.  When you turn off one of the user computers, it will be replaced by one of the neighboring peers, and the broadcast will continue. <br><br><h4>  Internal device service </h4><br><br>  Our service has been tested to support streaming over RTMP and RTSP protocols and using Flash Video, Microsoft WMV and SilverLight video formats.  As a video player, standard players are used - Flash, Windows Media Player or SilverLight.  Support for a standard Flash player allows you to monetize the service in a way that is convenient for you - for example, by displaying ads before broadcasting, or by selling access to broadcasts for money. <br><br>  Unfortunately, standard players do not allow the implementation of complex scenarios for processing and redirecting video streams, so for the implementation of P2P translations on the client side there should be an intermediate program that implements the logic of P2P interaction between clients.  This program receives video streams from other peers and transfers them to standard video players (for example, Adobe Flash Player or Windows Media Player).  The program can be installed as a plug-in to popular browsers (there are plug-ins for IE and Firefox).  It may seem to someone that the presence of an additional plug-in may scare off potential users.  However, test broadcasts have shown that if you place a clear and understandable warning about the need to download a plug-in, the vast majority of users will not have problems with this. <br><br><h4>  How to connect? </h4><br><br>  To use our service, you need to send a video stream to our server.  You will also need to specify the address provided to us in your player, and also place a short Javascript code on the HTML page from which the player is called, which will determine the type of browser and load the appropriate plugin.  Every time a user goes to the video page and clicks on the PLAY button, the plugin will receive a command from the video player to enter the P2P network through which the stream is being broadcast.  The plugin will receive the video stream from other peers of this network and send it to Flash or Windows Media player, and your users will see the webcast. <br><br><h4>  About future </h4><br><br>  It seems to us that P2P broadcasts are one of the most realistic ways to integrate television and the web.  In the near future, TV channels will be able to show video over the Internet using P2P technology, since  only it allows you to get a fairly low cost of broadcasting, comparable to the cost of broadcasting the television signal through cable or terrestrial television networks.  That is why we made the Lavina.TV project and we hope to make with it our modest contribution to the development of domestic Internet and television technologies. <br><br>  UPD <br><br>  Project website: <a href="http://www.p2pvideo.ru/">www.p2pvideo.ru</a> <br><br>  The testing page with a static file is now in development, we will launch soon. <br><br>  To test online broadcasts, please write me a message, we will arrange for you a separate page with your stream. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95195/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95195/</a></p>
