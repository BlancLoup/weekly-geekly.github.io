This tool is a turboenkabulyator.  So, essentially, the only new principle is that energy is not generated by the relative movement of conductors and fluxes, but is produced by the modular interaction of magnetoresistance and capacitive directivity. <br><br>  The original copy has a base plate made of prefabulary amulite, covered with a soft logarithmic case in such a way that the two bearings are in the same straight line with a pentametric fan.  The latter consists of only six hydrooptic ointment blades of the impeller, which are so oriented with the ambime-multiplying diminishing lunar axis, that the lateral tremor is completely prevented.  The main winding is a normal type of lotus-0-delta, it is placed in pan-seven-seven-hollow slots in the stator.  Every seventh conductor is connected by non-reversible three-tubes with differential grinding spring in the direction ‚Äútop‚Äù of the ends of gram-meters. </blockquote><br>  Does <a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ids/dotdot/misc/jokes/turboencabulator.txt">this text</a> inspire at least some idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe device being described?  It is possible to translate not only two paragraphs, but the whole article, inventing new words instead of fictitious terms.  The meaning is still not added, the text is comic.  His story is closely intertwined with the genre of educational films. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Turbokabulyator <a href="http://www.adl.com/uploads/tx_extprism/1995_q1_29.pdf">is the</a> invention of the British graduate student John Hellins Kvik.  The description appeared in the scientific publication of the British Institution of Electrical Engineers Students' Quarterly Journal in 1944.  Later, the text was repeatedly published repeatedly by different authors with changes.  Here is just <a href="http://www.floobydust.com/turbo-encabulator/ge_turbo-encabulator.pdf">one of the reprints from General Electric</a> .

      In subsequent modifications, the text changed, sometimes significantly.  But the highlights remained the same.  The text still spoke about the ‚Äúlogarithmic corpus‚Äù of the fictional machine.  Descriptions always contain an overwhelming amount of technical jargon.  Words are hard to read.  In fact, they are either made up, or their use in this context does not make any sense. <br><br>  In the circles of engineers, the existence of a turbo-capacitor and numerous colorful descriptions of the design have become a joke.  If you need to understand how a man in the street sees technical texts, it suffices to read the description of the turbo-capacitor.  A non-existent machine would have remained Hochma ‚Äúfor its own‚Äù, if not for a few videos. <br><br><h1>  Educational film </h1><br>  How to show industrial installation on video for another company or employee training?  May require the participation of man.  This could be a respectable engineer or someone from management.  Do they have time for that? <br><br>  More often professional actors take part in industrial training films and advertisements.  Yes, the actors are needed even for videos that the general public will not see.  The task of such actors are the demonstration and the story about the products.  Products whose principles of work they do not understand.  The incomprehensible text needs to be spoken without hesitation, in a confident tone.  You need the impression that the person on the screen perfectly understands the design of the displayed car. <br><br>  All these complex and little-known words should sound well delivered voice.  Speak well individual sounds can be learned at patters.  And where to draw confidence voices for the pronunciation of words, the meaning of which - a mystery?  The popularity of a turboencabulator in production videos began precisely with the need to somehow learn. <br><br>  Bad Haggart is one of these actors.  Over the years, he has appeared in a variety of educational films shot in Detroit and near the industrial center.  In 1977, for the first time, he read a description of a turbo-capacitor on a tape.  In circles familiar with the genre parody <a href="http://www.plcdev.com/an_interview_with_mike_kraft">was a success</a> . <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ac7G7xOG2Ag%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhqaGOjRQHfkDVS7oR0ZD2KhwYURA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <em>The first movie.</em> <br><br>  Bad <a href="http://www.thechiefstoryteller.com/blog/item/970-complete-text-of-turbo-encabulator-the-best-worst-example-of-jargon%3Ftmpl%3Dcomponent%26print%3D1">used the</a> audio woofer, which was called ‚Äúear‚Äù in slang.  It is said that he was a pioneer in its use.  One day, Haggart needed to read a speech without visible clues.  Attempts to remember nothing failed, so he went to the backup plan.  The actor recorded the right thing on the tape recorder, and later spoke to the earphone.  Today, many use exactly the same technique - except that the headset has become wireless. <br><br>  According to one data, the recording was a warm-up before the start of the actual shooting.  Another source claims that the shooting was carried out after working on a video for a car company.  The crew only stayed extra at the request of Haggart.  The actor often did not understand the meaning of the text that he read.  Therefore, he wrote down the text about the incubator - he believed that someone else should feel this situation. <br><br>  Anyway, the man in the video very confidently talks about the non-existent machine as if he had worked with it all his life.  In the end, he declares without a smile: ‚ÄúShe [the machine] is not cheap, but I am sure the state will buy it.‚Äù Then he shows a price tag of $ 750 million (today it is about $ 3 billion).  The crew stops laughter, but Haggart is still serious.  Such a fantastic acting game requires recognition and awards. <br><br>  Turbokabulyator was not forgotten.  Sometimes other companies and actors shot their own version of the parody of the educational film genre.  Here are some of them.  Sometimes the device is called the ‚Äúretroencabulator‚Äù, because the machines shown are electric power plants, not engines or other mechanical devices, and the prefix ‚Äúturbo‚Äù looks out of place.  It is often mentioned that the outlandish machine was invented precisely in the depths of the organization, in the walls of which a video was shot. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/MXW0bx_Ooq4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjt-wIl68geTtMMaGZxPnlaDZsOFA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <em>In this version, a diagnostics fragment written from scratch has been added.</em>  <em>Actor Mike Kraft starts it with a hysterical statement: "In order to add incomprehensibility, we removed the body."</em> <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/UyRllRWfLJE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh5_CAGxnDi6qsRqVhwJmFFakTk4A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <em>Another completely frivolous version.</em> <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/RXJKdh1KZ0w%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhGVHQyDHDzj2CdQmqc8T5xZSe6yg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <em>The installation is purely electric, so now it is an retro-battery.</em>  <em>When describing the case, Kraft makes movements with his hands, and suddenly everything becomes clearer.</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368581/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368581/</a></p>
