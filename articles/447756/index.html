Gartner predicts a fourfold growth in the APM monitoring market due to the digitization of business processes and coverage of 20% of all business applications by 2021.  Unfortunately, the report does not contain data on the method of calculating such growth, but when the word digitalisation or digital transformation is pronounced, the game ‚ÄúBulshit bingo‚Äù is remembered. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">See what this game looks like.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/r9/vl/6s/r9vl6srbbnfir9wo26slh4wrjn4.jpeg"><br></div></div><br>  In the article I will do without the elements of the game and give my brief analytics of the market for APM solutions according to the Gartner report.  Under the cat you will also find a link to the original report. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This year, the criteria for including an APM solution in the report all also include three key requirements:

      <b>Digital Experience Monitoring (DEM).</b>  DEM is an accessibility and performance monitoring discipline that improves the experience of everyone who interacts with enterprise applications and services.  For the purposes of this study, monitoring of real users (RUM) and synthetic transaction monitoring for both end users and mobile devices are included. <br><br>  <b>Detect, track, and diagnose applications (ADTD).</b>  Application discovery, tracking, and diagnostics are a set of processes designed to understand the relationships between application servers, map transactions between these nodes, and provide deep test methods using bytecode instrumentation (BCI) and distributed tracing. <br><br>  <b>Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps).</b>  AIOps platforms combine the functionality of big data and machine learning to support IT operations.  AIOps for applications automatically detects performance models and events or clusters, detects anomalies in the event data of time series, and identifies the root cause of application performance problems.  AIOps does this through machine learning, statistical inference, or other methods. <br><br>  Gartner's magic quadrants are divided into 4 sectors: leaders, challengers, strategists and niche players.  Each vendor is placed in the quadrant based on its strengths and weaknesses, market share and user feedback, as well as other indicators.  12 vendors that Gartner included this time: Broadcom (CA Technologies), Cisco (AppDynamics), Dynatrace, IBM, ManageEngine, Micro Focus, Microsoft, New Relic, Oracle, Riverbed, SolarWinds and Tingyun. <br><br>  So drum roll ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wq/ed/3d/wqed3ds-x6ov2v9nqbh9dliz3um.png"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Last year's quadrant here</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/s2/yg/bt/s2ygbtvcz2m-teqeugpohiulcji.png" alt="image"><br></div></div><br><br>  <a href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints%3Fid%3D1-6DTS40P%26ct%3D190318%26st%3Dsb">Link to the original report</a> <br><br>  The current magic quadrant is strikingly consistent with <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/351770/">last year's report</a> .  The ‚ÄúLeaders‚Äù and ‚ÄúChallengers‚Äù sectors remained generally unchanged.  Broadcom, Cisco, Dynatrace and New Relic have taken root in the leader sector, and IBM, Microsoft, Oracle and Riverbed in the candidate sector.  But strategists are absent this year (last year it was the same). <br><br>  The only changes occurred in the category of niche players, in which three vendors were removed following the results of last year: BMC, Correlsense and Nastel.  technology.  BMC no longer offers the APM tool, and Correlsense and Nastel are no longer meeting the requirements of this year‚Äôs Gartner. <br><br>  This year, Gartner continues the vector of last year‚Äôs magic quadrant and left the strategists sector empty.  Gartner describes strategists as manufacturers who "provide products that have developed a convincing plan to competitively meet the current and future market demands of APM solutions, but whose current product portfolio is still under development." <br><br>  The lack of strategists suggests that the APM market is stagnant in terms of development.  This may indicate that the current APM solutions are fully functional to solve emerging problems.  All the leaders, except Broadcom, have been them for seven years in a row, therefore, their vision and strategies are probably enough to move the market forward. <br><br>  If the market does not happen new events (such as mergers or acquisitions), next year the Magic Quadrant will not change much.  Gartner came to the conclusion that the market is healthy, despite the absence of changes in the quadrants.  But they noted that new manufacturers need to provide new functionality or focus on a specific niche in order to compete with recognized vendors (I‚Äôm talking about leaders). <br><br>  In his study, Gartner also reported that manufacturers of APM solutions extend monitoring functions in most areas, including applications, networks, databases, and servers.  It is clear that vendors want to benefit from every monitoring market where they can. <br><br>  Below is a list of vendors that seem to be close to inclusion in the quadrant, but do not meet the criteria: <br><br><ul><li>  Correlsense; </li><li>  Datadog; </li><li>  Elastic; </li><li>  Honeycomb; </li><li>  Instana; </li><li>  JenniferSoft; </li><li>  LightStep; </li><li>  Nastel Technologies; </li><li>  SignalFx; </li><li>  Splunk; </li><li>  Sysdig. </li></ul><br>  I think that if one of them unites, next year we will see a new leader.  That's just the question of how quickly they can make a monolithic solution, integrating their products. <br><br>  Please complete the survey at the end of the article.  Let's see how Gartner analytics is comparable with Russian realities. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/447756/">https://habr.com/ru/post/447756/</a></p>
