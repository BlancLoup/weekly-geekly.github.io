  <section class="page js-page"><h1>ALL without exception, the ministries of Ukraine must on their websites post information about NATO</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/044/d21/472/044d214725986b619ac3f7e3f0c162a3.jpg" width="262" height="161" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"><br>  Since July 17, Natalia Vitrenko, the main progressive socialist of Ukraine, has increased her work.  Now active hostilities against the ‚Äúenemy of Ukraine‚Äù, according to Vitrenko, of the NATO bloc, must be conducted not in Sevastopol or in any other city of our fatherland.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe theater of operations has been moved to the virtual world.  Where began the active propaganda of NATO, more precisely, the preparation for the entry of Ukraine into the bloc.  Now all anti-NATO politicians urgently need to look for Neo.  To destroy the Evil Citadel - The Matrix.  Will have to fight on its territory and with their own. <br>  Not more than 10 days ago, the recommendations of the Interdepartmental Working Group in the information sphere, the Interdepartmental Commission on the preparation of Ukraine for NATO membership were sent to inform about the cooperation of Ukraine with NATO on the websites of the executive authorities.  Now ALL ministries, without exception, are required to post information about NATO on their websites.  Octopus launched.  A ‚Äújab‚Äù of reputation has been applied, as well as the entire cause of parties and public organizations that, in one way or another, are fighting to prevent a ‚Äúcapitalist aggressive military bloc‚Äù on the territory of Ukraine.  This is not waving flags, not breaking up tents, or even setting up barriers from living people.  Here the resource is more powerful required.  Sorry head <br>  have to think.  In order to inflict a counterstrike on virtual propaganda, we need a staff not of the lumpen proletariat, but of highly qualified specialists in the field of IT technologies. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And the scope of interdepartmental working groups can be envied.  They did not miss a single department, ministry or regional state administration, who very much recommended creating permanent sites, at the worst of the rubric, about cooperation with NATO.  And there is no such information about horror, almost on all sites of the executive power.  The list is quite lengthy - more than 30 offices, ministries and committees.  What should everyone inform about the NATO bloc and European integration ?!  Well, with the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Defense, the National Center for Euro-Atlantic Integration, the State Committee for Television and Radio Broadcasting, everything is clear.  Placing on their sites any information related to this topic is logical and understandable.  Indirectly, this topic may include the websites of regional state administrations, the national space agency, the head department of state service, and several other websites. <br>  But I would like to draw attention to the following list.  Ministries of Agrarian Policy;  construction, architecture and public utilities;  internal affairs;  culture and tourism;  nature conservation;  fuel and energy;  in family, youth and sport affairs;  Higher Attestation Commission of the Main Switchgear;  State Highway Service, State Archives Committees;  forestry;  pension fund and other, and other, and other.  I especially like posting information about NATO on the Pension Fund website.  Well, you need to have such a violent fantasy, what would you write about NATO on the site of this fund.  Probably, the authorities, therefore, decided to influence the deductions.  For example, the businessman wants not to pay money to the Pension Fund.  He sees that it‚Äôs written on the foundation‚Äôs website how NATO is conducting some kind of military action and the businessman will change his mind.  Now no one wants to hide profits.  Or, for example, a pensioner, before receiving his pension, will require information about the block, and then you can get money.  Vitrenko did not expect such a "pig" from the government.  Propaganda began "in the holy of holies" of the provitrenkovsky electorate.  Who else but people of retirement age, do not want to let NATO into Ukraine. <br>  The absurdity of this recommendation suggests that the officials, as always, literally took the instructions of the leadership.  In order not to miss anyone, the list includes all existing branches of the executive branch.  There is an Antimonopoly Committee on the list.  Probably, in order for NATO not to be a monopolist in the ‚Äúmarket‚Äù of Ukraine, the committee will look for a competitor for it.  I can tell you the options: either Russia or China.  But the Russians somehow become boring for 70 years, but China is yes.  This is silich.  At any time, the Chinese army can put 100 million soldiers at bayonets.  They are NATO caps thrown.  Or take the committees of forest and water resources.  We have no problems with nature.  Why would not the sites "litter" information about the military unit.  This is even a way for officials.  Rather than searching for solutions to problems associated with natural disasters, collecting data about violators, both about enterprises and poachers, it is better to copy information about the block.  The work is done.  And the fact that today, deforestation in the western regions leads to flooding, so it is secondary.  The fact that the supply of fresh water, usable, decreases does not matter.  It is better to tell you how the next Enna meeting took place, at which they briefly mentioned the block. <br>  The State Property Fund is also obliged to think about NATO.  How, the privatization of all public facilities was successful.  The treasury received huge profits, new owners of enterprises regularly pay taxes, workers receive decent salaries and have social guarantees.  So why not write how many soldiers and officers serve in the unit, how much property that is movable or not movable can be ‚Äúgrabbed‚Äù.  This is truly the "golden bottom" for the SPF.  It is urgent to make a list and think at your leisure.  Semenyuk such a prospect will only be happy. <br>  The State Department of Food and the service of drugs and medical products also do not relax.  Categories on sites, oh how they need.  Not fixable, still no information.  Instead of writing about NATO, it‚Äôs not clear what they do.  Do not think about that comrades.  Even the responsibilities of the entire executive branch include the constant distribution of press releases about events related to Ukraine-NATO cooperation, regional, local and central media, as well as popular information Internet resources.  Now, any editorial offices of newspapers, television and radio can strain, for example, the State Statistics Committee, on the availability of information about NATO.  And ask them a question: ‚ÄúWhat did you do to ensure that Ukraine would learn about NATO‚Äôs North Atlantic military bloc?‚Äù <br>  Invented a new excuse for entrepreneurs.  As soon as the inspection came to you from the Sanitary and Epidemiological Station, and you said to them: ‚ÄúAnd give us information about NATO!  No information - no verification. ‚Äù  Point.  Here are just the state tax service in the list was not.  Whether otmazatsya, or forgotten. <br>  Do not envy Natalia Vitrenko, nothing to say.  If she does not find Neo, then Trinity or Morpheus herself will have to become.  Or do a tattoo on the shoulder in the form of a rabbit and walk around the apartments, hoping to find a hacker.  Only which pill Neo found will want to swallow is unknown. <br>  The next stage for advertising the military bloc will be computer games on the websites of the executive.  There will be an emulator ‚ÄúI am in NATO‚Äù, a shooter ‚ÄúKill the enemy of NATO‚Äù, an arcade game ‚ÄúGather more NATO member countries‚Äù and so on.  Look for the Petrovka stalls. <br><br>  <a href="http://oligarh.net/%3F/themeofday/25264/">A source</a> </div>
