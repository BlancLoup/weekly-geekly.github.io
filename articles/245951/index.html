  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Interfaces What to read, how to develop</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Designing interfaces - to make the world better and more convenient, to be more precise - to eliminate inconveniences.  Whatever industry we are talking about, be it the interface of a smartphone, vending machine, application or website - in any case, the interface designer is responsible for the interaction of the person with the world around him.  You can go to dozens of courses, conferences and many other things, but so learn how to make convenient interfaces, in this case the most important thing is to love the design, see the future, if you can say so, and analyze the behavior of people.  Under the cat 6 books that will help develop in this direction, both developers and managers / owners of projects.  We tried to apply in the previous <a href="http://filegiver.com/">project</a> much of what was read, what came of it, judge for yourself. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b><a href="">Alan Cooper - Mental Hospital in the hands of patients</a></b> <br><br>  How to keep up with the technical progress that updates our phones and cars so fast that we do not have time to get used to them?  Everything that surrounds us is created by people who have begun to forget that the main advantage of the product is simplicity.  For the main engineers here, who think not at all like us. <br>  Alan Cooper offers the simplest solution to the problem: before embarking on programming, it is worth trying to model the interaction with the client. <br><br>  <b><a href="">Jennifer Tidwell - User Interface Development</a></b>

      The modern user is spoiled by a huge range of software.  Therefore, in order for the program to draw attention to itself, it must be distinguished by ease of use, coupled with all the necessary functionality, and even please the eye with a non-trivial design.  Only such software will be sold fast enough to satisfy the customer. <br>  The book by Jennifer Tidwell will tell about outstanding achievements in the field of design and about the most original and non-standard solutions to common problems that arise. <br><br>  <b><a href="">Aaron Walter - Emotional Web Design</a></b> <br><br>  Every day we travel to exactly the same sites, which cause us to be disheartened by our gray monotony.  Unsuccessful attempts to stand out only lead to irritation of the client.  How to organize such a portal, which instead of negative emotions would cause the visitor the joy and desire to return? <br>  Aaron Walter will talk about ‚Äúemotional design,‚Äù designed to give the visitor only positive feelings.  The book contains many recommendations on how to equip your site so that the impression of visiting it remains with the client for a long time. <br><br>  <b><a href="">Victor Papanek - Design for the real world</a></b> <br><br>  This book has long been considered a classic design - literature.  In many educational institutions, it is included in the compulsory reading program for design departments.  It is relevant to this day, although it was written in the 1970s. <br>  Victor Papanek proposes to consider design as planning to achieve the goal in any activity and finds us all designers, noting that any attempt to isolate the design, turning it into a thing-in-itself, will have only a negative impact on it.  The book is read very easily, because the author builds almost all the story on vivid examples. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://filegiver.com/free-download/Dzhess-Garret-Veb-dizayn-Elementy-opyta-vzaimodeystviya.pdf">Jess Garrett - Web Design - Elements for an Interaction Experience</a></b> <br><br>  An effective website should not only serve the goals of the company, but also remain useful to the consumer.  To achieve such a balance, when both tasks would be performed, with inconsistently designed interaction experience, even high-quality content will not help. <br>  Jess Garrett does not provide advice on the use of tools, but reveals general ideas that are the "foundation" in relations with users, using simple explanations and illustrative illustrations. <br><br>  <b><a href="">Jeff Raskin - Interface: New Directions in Computer Systems Design</a></b> <br><br>  This book is a great opportunity to get to know Jeff Raskin, one of the Apple Macintosh developers.  She talks about why most modern approaches to interface design lead to a dead end, and offers completely new design principles.  To argue his point of view, the author analyzes those things that are so close to us that we do not even think about how they work. <br>  The book can be useful not only for the designers themselves, but also for project managers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/245951/">https://habr.com/ru/post/245951/</a></p>
