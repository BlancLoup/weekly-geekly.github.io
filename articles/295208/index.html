  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Place "goals" in the workflow</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I think everyone knows what ‚Äúgoal‚Äù is - goals in life, goals at work, for which they are needed, but, as I have learned from my own experience in working with clients, there are very few people who set goals for themselves.  And it would be necessary.  If the owner of an average company does not have a concrete understanding of what, in fact, go, what to develop, what to achieve, then there can be no question of any increase in profits and development of the company.  But first things first. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It's no secret that the purpose of creating most companies is to make a profit in the first place, unless, of course, you plan to engage in charity.  And all the components follow from this main goal, such as: increasing the company's profit, increasing the number of customers, increasing the average check, increasing the brand awareness of the company, increasing the skills of specialists, expanding the company's staff, etc. There are a lot of such goals, priorities all set in their own way.  But the vast majority of such owners of small and medium, and not rarely, and large business do not set any intermediate goals for increasing any indicators.  Some people cannot because of inexperience and are afraid of being deceived, they just work and everything, they don‚Äôt think about anything, make ends meet, others don‚Äôt want it because the business process is streamlined, they have reached their level of comfort and do not plan anything change, although opportunities for expansion abound. <br><br>  And my colleagues and I decided to fight it and set ourselves a goal.  Try to teach customers to set goals.  Every day, communicating with new customers, we ask the question: ‚ÄúWhat goals do you set for yourself?  What do you want to get from cooperation with our company?  Do you have any development plan for half a year or a year? ‚Äù.  Most often we hear such answers: ‚ÄúI want more money‚Äù, ‚ÄúI want to increase sales‚Äù, ‚ÄúI want more customers‚Äù, ‚ÄúI want more positions on the requests of my site in the TOP-10 search engines‚Äù, ‚ÄúI want to increase the average check‚Äù, ‚Äú I want more traffic on the site "and stuff like that.  Here they are the goals of our customers.  How do you think, are these goals achievable?  If we bring one client more to the company, it means that the goal has already been achieved.  But is this the goal that you set for yourself?  Then we ask the following question: "Is there an understanding of how much you want to increase sales, average bill, number of calls, etc.?" Units answer this question with numbers, the rest say: "I don't know."  Here it is the trouble.  Many have decided that they have issued IP or LLC and that's it, they are already businessmen.  And elementary, preliminary analysis of the market capacity, analysis of demand and competitiveness in the chosen field of activity was not carried out.  I decided that I will sell phone cases through the site, I will sell, everyone has their own phones.  And in parallel, I will try to sell the machines suddenly.  Therefore, in our work, we try to find out the specific goals of our clients, so that we can clearly see what we are going and what results we will achieve. <br><br>  Often you have to deal with the fact that the client can not designate a specific goal, except as "I want to earn more."  In such situations, managers are trying to help customers determine their goal, no matter how strange it sounds.  For many years of experience, we have concluded that many clients must first of all be interested in developing their own business - this is a paradox.  This is everywhere and this is the misfortune of our customers.

      Sometimes you have to set a goal for the client.  We offer the client some achievable goal, designate the time to achieve it, draw up a plan for the implementation of this goal, achieve it, report to the client and show the result.  The client sees the effect, and he becomes interested, he is involved in his own business process.  He begins to independently form new goals for himself, for us, both for performers and for his company.  This is where our initial goal has been achieved. <br><br>  So, we have identified the client‚Äôs goals.  We must clearly understand what the client wants, what goals he sets.  Further, it is necessary to check the attainability of the identified goals, since most business owners are very ambitious, and sometimes too much to achieve their goals.  In this case, we analyze whether the capacity of the market allows to solve this problem.  The advantage of the Internet is that everything can be expressed in numbers and calculated, hence we can conclude that we can offer the client.  If the goal is achievable, we determine the timing of its implementation.  If the goal is unattainable, we identify the maximum that is realistic to achieve and also set time limits for the implementation of the task.  Also, often we are faced with the fact that the goal that the client sets is absolutely not appropriate.  That is, it is just his desire, it may be ineffective in the future, unprofitable.  Our task is to work for the result, and in such situations we try to convey to the client that such a goal will not bring anything at all. <br><br>  At the goal verification stage: <br>  - We must be 100% sure of what the client has a goal. <br>  - Whether the manager and the client correctly understand the same goal. <br>  - It is necessary to speak the goal for its approval. <br>  - It is necessary to check the reachability of the goal. <br>  - Check the ‚Äúappropriateness‚Äù of the target. <br><br>  These theses are our managers are guided before starting work with the client.  We explain why everything is studied so thoroughly.  In the provision of services, where you need to show the result of cooperation, it is necessary to set goals very clearly so that the result can be felt so that the cooperation is as transparent as possible and the client understands what he is paying the contractor for. <br>  After checking the goal, if necessary, adjust them together with the client.  This is the most painstaking task solved.  Once we are clearly aware of the goal of the client, we begin to create a plan to achieve it, with clear timelines and milestones.  After we approve the plan with the client, the specialists of the technical department, the marketing department, etc., enter the business. It is very important that the intermediate tasks are carried out consistently and on time.  After each solved task on the way to the first goal, we notify the client about it.  We keep him informed on the progress of the work. <br><br>  We have reached our goals - what's next?  The client is satisfied, he likes it, everything is fine.  And here comes the same, notorious comfort zone.  Often, having achieved little success, customers stop at what has been accomplished.  ‚ÄúNow the process has been adjusted, you can take up personal life, etc.‚Äù And at this moment it is necessary to analyze the result and form new goals, so as not to stand still, move on.  After all, there are many aspects in the business process that can be improved and improved.  We conducted an analysis of the results, provided a report to the client.  They pointed out positive and negative sides, provided a number of recommendations on how to change them, and proceed to the formation of new business goals for the client‚Äôs company.  After the initial result is obtained, the client, as a rule, develops an understanding of what to do next, he is already more deeply involved in running his business, begins to take a more active part in the formation of new goals, new ideas appear, new opportunities open up. <br><br>  Further, we act in the same vein: we have formed new goals, checked how they are achievable, corrected if necessary, approved and set about achieving it.  This process can be applied both to the macro objectives of the company, and to the micro goals of their personal goals on the way to achieving some global goal. <br><br>  A client‚Äôs life in a company is a difficult path, consisting of identifying clients ‚Äôgoals, updating their goals, achieving their goals and forming new goals.  The process of setting and achieving goals should ideally be cyclical.  There is always room to grow and develop. <br><br>  Set goals and achieve them, and you will constantly see the result of your efforts, which cannot but satisfy the potential for further development. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295208/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295208/</a></p>
