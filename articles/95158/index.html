I got used to it for a couple of days, not more.  Everything works quickly and without glitches.  At first I was strained, because he was losing my network.  When switching to WiFi -&gt; EDGE and 3G -&gt; EDGE, but then it turned out that the matter was in the old SIM card of MTS.  I changed Simka to a new Megafonovskaya and everything became perfect.

      The case with a screen in 3.7 ‚Äùis certainly not small.  One hand to reach all the buttons is problematic.  It is necessary to intercept.  The case is of high quality - without squeaks and backlashes.  However, not sticky, slippery.  So I want to ‚Äúrubberize‚Äù it.  Buttons when necessary are highlighted.  At first, the optical trackball touched, but after a few days I learned how to bypass it.  The USB port is intelligently placed below, even during charging, you can use the device. <br><br>  Locking / unlocking in two movements like on an iPhone is a ponto, but not practical.  A simple mechanical slider on the side, as on the Nokia 5800 is much more convenient. <br><br>  Screen.  AMOLED is saturation and contrast.  In my European view, and that and another bust.  I had to make obviously paler photos of relatives that I carry in my phone, otherwise they just knock down my legs.  With all this, the screen fades in the direct sun, you have to look in your own shadow.  What kind of coverage is on the screen.  It is dirty from the fingers, it is less than the Spica.  The sensitivity of the sensor at the screen is excellent.  The response to the touch is adequate. <br><br>  The sound is good.  Both in the speaker and in the headphones.  Perhaps the bell would be worth a little louder to do, however, maybe I‚Äôm already deaf.  The voice on the handset sounds very natural as in a good MP3. <br><br>  The phone interface does not make sense to describe.  It is known that the shell HTC Sense most thoughtful on the market.  And it is.  I must say that Sense is so closely intertwined in Android 2.1, that to understand where one ends and the other begins is completely impossible.  HTC offers the ideology of using full-screen widgets.  In this case, flipping desktops as it turns into a switch between tasks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4f0/7ac/b9e/4f07acb9e29ec60c0b2d40d830b0bd15.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d2a/ce2/c75/d2ace2c75851c19065a344cc5ab429e7.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d0a/140/b1e/d0a140b1e40d2c87aade4123864474fb.jpg" alt="image"><br>  device014 device011 device017 <br><br>  The virtual keyboard Touch Input is implemented elegantly.  For three weeks, the need to put something alternative did not arise. <br><br>  There is a phonebook integration in Facebook, Flickr and Twitter, but some kind of incomplete.  That is, you can, for example, link a Facebook profile to a contact, but I did not understand how to send a message directly from a contact. <br><br>  The camera, from my photographic point of view, is quite good.  Runs quickly.  There are enough settings.  I just wish that the white balance settings were more ‚Äúat hand‚Äù, otherwise they were hidden far away. <br><br>  For a powerful processor you have to pay less battery life.  The device lasts for one day, no more.  You can charge both from the network and from USB, but charging from USB goes noticeably (at times) more slowly than from the network. <br><br>  About Desire here already wrote, for this I do not put this post in the blog Android.  Ask if anything ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95158/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95158/</a></p>
