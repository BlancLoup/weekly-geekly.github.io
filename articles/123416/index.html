  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Network: what future awaits my son, can I help him</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  My son is now about 3 years old.  Beautiful is growing, not stupid like - I am satisfied.  Considering my enthusiasm from the early youth of IT in general and computers in particular, I recently began to think, and what would my son see when he was 9-12 years old when he was free to surf the net?  What is going to happen (God forbid, not earlier than his nine years), I have no doubt!  I am absolutely sure that when he goes to the first class he will definitely have at least one device, in addition to a home computer, which will have access to the Internet.  I just think of a class before the 3-5th, I can still control the sites and the content that it will view, listen to, read. <br><br>  It is clear that to some extent, in fact, social networks will remain, there will be the same Skype and ICQ (although I have doubts about it, given the huge increase in channel capacity and the development of video chats - Google+ greetings), but I absolutely I am sure that all this will be far from now.  I do not want to do futurology in the topic and speculate on how it will look and how it will be implemented.  In terms of discussion, I assume that this will be very similar to everything that exists.  And the look and ways?  Many people have already discussed this topic, whose opinion, in my opinion, is much more objective and professional. <br><br>  I now have a question more, and how can I help him?  Like any father, I want to see my son educated, intelligent and sociable, and I suspect that after a very short time this will be hard to achieve if you isolate your beloved child from all the possibilities that the global network already offers.

      The main solution is, of course, all sorts of parental control programs, specialized browsers, etc.  - software part.  On this, thank God, I have enough knowledge and opportunities.  Here I would like to speculate about education, adaptation, so to speak within the family. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I just want to make a reservation that I started thinking about this quite recently, and I do not pretend to have a profound psychological analysis in the upbringing of children and to compile the ‚ÄúUser Guide for the Formation of a Developing Person through High Technologies‚Äù.  I just wanted to speculate how to make so that of everything that can be seen by properly filling out the search string in the browser, my child often wrote the words that will help him become a more interesting and intelligent person.  And so, strictly speaking, what idea have I stopped at the moment?  It was born after reading one interesting article, which cited an example of looking at Russia as a country as a whole on the basis of negative (violence, betrayal) or positive facts of our history.  The specificity of the article in this case is irrelevant; a difference in the very approach to the fact that on the basis of different data or facts a completely different opinion can be helpful.  That's what I thought: it is necessary throughout the whole time of the formation of my child's ‚Äúacquaintance‚Äù with the network - with everything that is shown and written there, to demonstrate (with a certain selection) what he is interested in at the moment.  Interest him.  Show that the network is a great helper and prompter.  To do thematic selections on some topics, let them may not be useful later, he is still very small, his assiduity is about 10-15 minutes maximum, and he loses interest quickly - now he wants to play and right there he is all in a cartoon.  After all, I, with all my knowledge, what and how to search on the net, I can find really interesting things.  For example, recording the arrival to the station in some American town of this old train (he likes trains) with a beep, with smoke - with all the special effects, and not recording a boring lecture on locomotives from St. Petersburg State University of communications or camera filming in the metro station. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAll this is understandable,‚Äù you will say, ‚ÄúBut how does this protect him from porn and network violence?‚Äù  No  It just seems to me that now, while he learns everything, studies, examines, I must unobtrusively have time to show him that the network is a limitless expanse of everything, everything that is interesting, that they just want to know or see.  As Konstantin Kushner said, ‚ÄúChildren need to be taught only good things, and they learn bad things themselves.‚Äù <br><br>  Imagine a child who knows nothing except the search engine and the address bar, comes into the network?  This is what ‚Äúnetwork education‚Äù is. <br><br>  Moving on to an older age.  Many parents of today's youth are not very competently communicating with computers at the exit, without giving proper knowledge to children, and, often without having them, simply let them into the network.  At the exit, we get the pages of the social networks for the most part, they are absolutely incomprehensible than with what, or even purposefully absolute ... you understand, they came across.  Analogies.  As a child, my parents and friends (social circle) were taught that looking good is right, it's beautiful.  Say thank you it's polite.  And shouting vulgar jokes all over the street and, excuse me, p <i>and</i> sit up with people, it is modern speaking that it sucks and is far from awesome.  But if I tell my child that his page, his comments, his photos on the web and his page must be adequate, that they are watched and seen by everyone, then surely he wonders when he will create and fill all this.  A vivid example, which is given by all who have long been communicating in the network: before, RuNet was not so crowded with vulgarity and in general was more cultured and calm.  At the time of its formation (Runet), educated and not stupid people communicated in it, who understood that having written something in the comments or having posted a photo, and then turning off the monitor, what was written and published did not disappear, and moreover multiply!  What others see it and can remember and draw conclusions.  Then further distribution / expansion of the network, more diverse people and everything, welcome to what we have now.  And modern children (I have friends of relatives who have not been born when I registered in my first chat) have all this without due attention from adults (and the time was like that - it wasn‚Äôt exactly what adults wrote before their child‚Äôs networks were absorbed and with childish irresponsibility together with thoughtlessness laid out, described, commented.  They are just so accustomed, and as they mature, they are trying again to relearn, correct.  Heavy.  Many seem to succeed.  And this is good! <br><br>  This is about my view on raising my child to communicate with a computer and a network. <br>  I am sure that he himself will see in her, in the end, violence and musical drugs, and fascism, and pornography, and simply human stupidity - this is in bulk.  But he will meet her as an almost unlimitedly huge knowledge base for education, his hobbies, acquaintance and communication with friends.  I will do for this all that I need, as far as I‚Äôll have enough of the knowledge that I myself have acquired and will still acquire by typing absolutely everything in the search bar that interests me and having often received more than one excellent answer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/123416/">https://habr.com/ru/post/123416/</a></p>
