And with an obvious hint of Team Fortress 2. Why?  Let's try to analyze. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ed0/184/f0e/ed0184f0e9104b4ca12a634f71f809aa.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Probably for a different company, the question of a new universe would not have been so acute, but playing in a new setting for Blizzard?  Yes, and with a powerful competitor in the market in the face of Team Fortress 2, which, at first glance, pulls over the whole mass of players.

      Let's just drop the assumptions in the style: ‚ÄúThey stole Dota 2 from us - let's steal Team Fortress from them‚Äù.  When the capitalization of your company reaches (approximately) $ 15B, children's grievances can cost too much.  It seems to me that Sirius is still involved in business and nothing more.  For example, here are the TOP-10 online games of this year in terms of revenue: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/248/88a/1b1/24888a1b164e4e78bc7959510fe9c207.jpg"><br><br>  Here we see only 5 segments: online shooter, MMORPG, MOVA (or DOTA-like), tank arcade and card game.  Given that World of Tanks is too specific, in which segment is there no Blizzard?  Yes, these are shooters. <br><br>  <b>But why compete with Team Fortress 2?</b> <br><br>  Are they serious?  All shooters presented in the list are realistic, they rest on well-developed physics and the correspondence of all game characteristics to real ones (or they strive for this). <br><br>  So why Team Fortress 2?  After all, realistic shooters from the top ten earned $ 1.4B all together?  No kidding, cartoon graphics and non-existent physics.  Moreover, <abbr title="Team fortress 2">TF2 is</abbr> not even in the top ten.  Why did Blizzard choose another niche? <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Is Team Fortress 2 a separate niche?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  One can argue whether <abbr title="Team fortress 2">TF2</abbr> owns a separate niche in the online shooter market.  I'm still inclined to own - too much mechanic separates her from the realistic shooter.  The most important thing is the difference in strategic goals: <abbr title="Team fortress 2">TF2</abbr> wants to entertain you, a realistic shooter (first of all) wants you to achieve some goal (rank, clan level, etc.) </div></div><br><h5>  Competition </h5><br>  Of course, this is the most obvious answer.  Like, there are these realistic shooters (it should be mentioned that Warface and PointBlank also earn good money), like uncut dogs, and <abbr title="Team fortress 2">TF2</abbr> is the only one.  But this answer lacks a couple of clarifications: <br><br><ul><li>  All shooters from the top hold the player.  All these ranks, not an open weapon, an endless stream of goals that cause the player to return to the game again and again.  TF2 also holds the player, but incomparably softer.  That is, TF2 players are <b>mobile</b> .  Moreover, they are ready to try something new - Team Fortress 2 has been on the market for seven years, I want diversity. </li><li>  The first point also suggests the following thought.  Competition in the market of realistic shooters acquires signs of "toxic."  This, of course, only my assumptions, but such efforts to keep the player can talk about high marketing costs.  That is, attracting new players to these games can be very expensive and it is more profitable to keep them by all means.  As a result, the operating profit, even taking into account the huge revenue, may be scanty (or not consistent with the philosophy and views of Blizzard).  In turn, <abbr title="Team fortress 2">TF2 is</abbr> a monopolist in its market, and therefore its costs are lower. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Diversity </h5><br>  Marketing theory tells us that excessive variety <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/too-many-choices/">can cause a stupor</a> when you, the buyer, are confused in the grief of brands and prices and, as a result, do not buy anything. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">What you need to pay attention to the stupor of the buyer?</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Diversity really should be redundant.  Five beers, for example, do not scare anyone.  But 125 - quite. </li><li>  Buyer must be new.  If you are a professional sommelier, then 125 varieties of wine will not scare you.  In addition, an experienced buyer is inclined to try something new (if it is not laundry detergent, of course). </li></ul></div></div><br>  Understand what the difference between about 10 realistic shooters, more and wedged into this pile and make a profit, a thankless task.  And <abbr title="Team fortress 2">TF2</abbr> is the only one, so it's easier to enter the market. <br><br><h5>  Monetization </h5><br>  Yes, <abbr title="Team fortress 2">TF2 was</abbr> not included in the top by revenue, but - and to whom is it unknown?  - enters the top by <abbr title="average revenue per user">ARPU</abbr> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9de/587/bec/9de587becf4c498f80d7a6272a1028e0.jpg"><br><br>  So, there is not a single shooter above <abbr title="Team fortress 2">TF2</abbr> , this tells us about three things about the future Overwatch market: <br><br><ul><li>  You can limit the marketing budget - the project will be profitable with a relatively small audience, plus an organic (relatively free) increase in the audience gives a big profit.  Given the fame of Blizzard, substantial organic growth can be expected. </li><li>  The audience is ready to pay.  Let me remind you, <abbr title="Team fortress 2">TF2</abbr> players are mobile and are looking for diversity.  They also pay $ 4.36. </li><li>  The audience is not just ready to pay.  She is ready to pay for decorations, things that do not affect the balance (those same hats). </li></ul><br><br><h5>  <abbr title="Team fortress 2">TF2</abbr> market position </h5><br>  If you use <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B0_%25D0%2591%25D0%259A%25D0%2593">the BCG matrix</a> , it turns out that <abbr title="Team fortress 2">TF2</abbr> is the Cash Cow.  There is no income growth (last year <abbr title="Team fortress 2">TF2</abbr> was in the TOP-10 by revenue, but not in this one), but <abbr title="Team fortress 2">TF2‚Äôs</abbr> market share is very high.  That is, Overwatch enters the market with a deliberately weaker (probably correctly used the expression ‚Äúaging‚Äù) competitor. <br><br><h5>  Depth </h5><br>  This is just a giant question for realistic shooters.  Remember how Crossfire gets out of this situation (mutant attack, zombie attack).  Really, what new can give us a realistic shooter?  Nothing serious.  Fantasy world?  Anything, characters become invisible, shoot dragons and fly.  Depth, again, is associated with the loyalty and life of the player.  And, which time, costs of deduction decrease.  The fact of the depth shows the gameplay trailer Overwatch very well, it is very difficult to imagine something similar in the conditional Warface: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Pfu5NVoMg0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgxVkvbiEHtfPRkgWWmRYQvSsRiuA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Total </h5><br>  What do we get in the general balance?  Blizzard is entering a new, non-aggressive market with a paying audience.  At the same time, she can demonstrate her best qualities - humor and juicy cartoony graphics.  Plus, the core of TF2 players is ready to try a new game in a familiar genre. <br><br>  But the most interesting thing is whether Blizzard will be aggressive in the market?  Perhaps they will crush this soft <abbr title="Team fortress 2">TF2</abbr> ? <br><br>  So what is the question.  If you roughly take the existing TF2 audience for 5 million (5M), and assume that Overwatch will attract the same 5M people, then Blizzard faces a problem.  If they hold the player as softly as TF2, then a part of the attracted audience (suppose 3M) will sooner or later try TF2.  And Valve will almost double its audience and not pay a cent for it!  Naturally, according to Blizzard, this would not be fair. <br><br>  In such a case, perhaps it is worth trying tougher retention methods?  Like realistic shooters?  The correct answer is no.  Tough retention methods will spawn a marketing war.  This means lower profits for both competitors.  This also means that the overflow between games will begin to be limited.  Suppose that under ‚Äúsoft‚Äù conditions, 2M-3M players would spill over from TF2 into Overwatch.  And in harsh conditions will flow 1M-2M.  With ARPU - $ 4.36, this is a difference of $ 4 360 000. Not very weak. <br><br>  And if they can come to the right answer?  Not.  The economy describes such a situation as a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB%25D1%258E%25D1%2587%25D1%2591%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE">prisoner's dilemma</a> .  That is, as I said, Blizzard and Valve maximize profits if they are not aggressive in retaining players and allow them to ‚Äúspill over‚Äù from one game to another.  Otherwise, they will reach the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%259D%25D1%258D%25D1%2588%25D0%25B0">Nash equilibrium</a> , which we see in the MOBA market for example - the struggle and the gigantic marketing budgets of LoL and Dota 2. So, the prisoner's dilemma does not imply the most profitable solution for those involved, that is, most likely (if Valve gets involved) waiting for a marketing war.  But from the point of view of the consumer, I even like it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363285/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363285/</a></p>
