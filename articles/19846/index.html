In Russia, there are no IT companies died of starvation.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <em>Thanks to everyone who commented on the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/do_it_yourself_marketing/35253.html">first part</a> .</em> <br><br>  <strong>In Russia, there are no IT companies dead from starvation.</strong> <br>  But full of companies dead from obesity.  An attempt to do everything and immediately does not lead to anything good.  Look around and you will see that experts are much more expensive than laborers and the demand for them is much higher.  Because your task is to find your niche in the market. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Finding a niche is called the buzzword ‚Äútargeting.‚Äù  Necessary and sufficient actions when targeting are the answer to the following six questions.  If you cope with them, your company will not face starvation and obesity.  So: <br><br>  1. Your products and your partners.  Decide what you are strong in and what you specialize in, and what you can give to subcontracting partners.  (For me personally, it was very difficult to give something to a potential competitor, but practice has shown that it doesn‚Äôt hurt at all, but, on the contrary, it is quite profitable. Search for partners and building relationships with them is a topic for a separate opus). <br>  2. Your target markets.  It is best to analyze your past successful projects and go to a market in which you have already succeeded so far.  If you master a new market for you - it does not matter, show that you know the problems of the client, understand his needs, know how to communicate in his language. <br>  3. Your markets and customers.  What market share can claim your product, how much it is available to your potential customers. <br>  4. Available to you market.  Which market segments are already closed by your competitors, where is your place in the market. <br>  5. Your target segment.  What are your distinctive qualities, and what are the attributes of your potential customers, for whom these qualities are of paramount importance. <br>  6. Your classification strategy for target customers.  Highlight the main classes of your potential customers to be able to communicate with the group as a single audience.  This will increase the addressability and, accordingly, the effect.

      When working with client groups, pay special attention to the following aspects of your clients' activities: <br>  ‚Ä¢ How do they make money? <br>  ‚Ä¢ Who are their customers? <br>  ‚Ä¢ How do they use technology? <br>  ‚Ä¢ What are the main problems in their business? <br>  ‚Ä¢ Who makes the decisions? <br>  ‚Ä¢ What terminology do they use in their work? <br>  ‚Ä¢ How to contact them? <br><br>  Of course, the answers to most questions depend on the market to which the product is oriented.  But some answers have been found before you.  Research <a href="http://www.ami-partners.com/">AMI-Partners</a> demonstrate the following priorities for customers when choosing an IT product (in order of decreasing importance): <br>  ‚Ä¢ More complete customer satisfaction; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Conclusion of new deals; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Cash Management; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Time management; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Reduced maintenance costs. <br><br>  As you can see, ‚Äúthe introduction of innovative technologies based on revolutionary algorithms‚Äù is not among the top five priorities (in full results it is in eighth place).  Attempting to sell technology, as a rule, will not bring success, you need to be able to sell a solution to problems. <br><br>  So, we take into account all this and try to sell to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/">habrahabr.ru</a> media holdings: <br>  ‚ÄúInformational publications that, as a rule, grew out of traditional media have problems with attracting an audience that identifies itself to the high-tech generation.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/">Habrahabr.ru</a> is a self-organizing site and allows, with minimal investment in the preparation of authors of publications, to get up to 60,000 unique readers per day.  Unlike highly specialized websites, the audience at <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/">habrahabr.ru</a> allows advertising not only computer-related products. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19846/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19846/</a></p>
