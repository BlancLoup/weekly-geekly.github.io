      At first glance, it looks like a clever and powerful idea: take a group of doubting potential Vista users, give them fun to play around with the new Mojave operating system and then break them off: ‚ÄúThis is not Mojave.  The operating system that you liked so much, in fact ... Vista!  We just changed the name!  Ha ha ha!  How do you like that ?! ‚Äù <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  And suddenly the world is forced to reconsider its contempt for Microsoft's main product, just as in the 80s hidden cameras forced us all to reconsider views of the freshly created taste of instant coffee Folgers Crystals ( <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/video/clips/schillervision-hidden-camera/2656/">http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/video / clips / schillervision-hidden-camera / 2656 /</a> ). <br><br>  However, the problem is in the second, third and all subsequent views on the issue.  Since the re-learning process itself shows how much the so-called Mojave project is in fact false and deceptive. <br><br>  For starters, it is worth saying that he is dishonest.  People do not doubt and do not feel antipathy towards Vista because it is fun and fashionable to insult it;  There is a small benefit in swearing the operating system.  The attitude to Vista is suddenly changing, according to the company's own official recognition, for the reason that this operating system is a weed that eats memory.  The problems are unlikely to be obvious to new users, but familiarity with Vista is a matter of contempt.  Structural deficiencies manifest themselves in order to interrupt, interfere and slow down in general.  And while the company likes to note 89 percent customer satisfaction in internal research, the statistics show an 11 percent dissatisfaction, an unacceptably high percentage, expressed in more than 10 million users, 100 percent of whom have computers to spread bad news. <br><br>  Meanwhile, on the subject of ‚Äúsmall gains,‚Äù history has shown the ineffectiveness of the prospects of referring to them as uneducated sheep, who are too stupid to think for themselves.  Remember the 1985 Lemming shameful ad for Macintosh ( <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D-KNrxwl59I0">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KNrxwl59I0</a> ), the acclaimed sequel to the 1984 movie ( <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DOYecfV3ubP8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYecfV3ubP8</a> )?  As it turned out, the target audience of office computer users was not very happy about their image as people with a lack of intelligence or goodwill, and they would not follow their colleagues off a cliff. <br><br>  In the last words of the Mojave project ( <a href="http://www.mojaveexperiment.com/">http://www.mojaveexperiment.com/</a> ), we see that the object knew that its Mojave was actually Vista.  ‚ÄúBut why is she faster?‚Äù He asks, and this is the very moment X.  Touche!  "Does not fit, justify it." <br><br>  Except for this rather correct question. <br><br>  As the user of the Digg network, under the name Marketmule, says, ‚Äúoptimal installation of the operating system by the best specialist in optimal equipment in optimal conditions performs the optimal set of tasks.  In such conditions, I could make a rose from shit and win first place in the flower competition. ‚Äù  Yes, Marketmule.  You did not even mention the theme of the driving forces of man: people tend to please their gracious masters. <br><br>  However, let us return to our sheep, suppose that Microsoft‚Äôs message is reasonable, that Vista is an ideal and its dissatisfied users are hopelessly stupid or misinformed in the wildest way.  There is still no point in trying to correct their perception.  This is a stupid idea in the spirit of the US State Department, which spends endless millions of dollars trying to convince Arabs and Muslims that they misunderstand us.  As long as the US policy towards Israel and Palestine remains in its place (correct or not), the Arabs will be offended by us.  Point.  Sugary advertisements for smiling American Muslims in headscarves will have no effect whatsoever. <br><br>  Unfortunately, Microsoft, like the US government, is not going to change the product itself in the near future.  The operating systems of the new generation will appear not earlier than in a few years, and the operating system is not a jar of instant coffee, which you can force the buyer to purchase with minimal risk for you.  Honor and praise to Bradley &amp; Montgomery from Indianapolis for starting an open dialogue on the subject.  However, the agency and its client will receive unpleasant reviews for a long time. <br><br>  August 8, Bob Garfield, Advertising Age <br>  ( <a href="http://adage.com/garfield/post%3Farticle_id%3D130250">http://adage.com/garfield/post?article_id=130250</a> ) <br><br>  First published: <a href="http://drugsnboobs.livejournal.com/">http://drugsnboobs.livejournal.com</a> <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/36852/">https://habr.com/ru/post/36852/</a></p>
