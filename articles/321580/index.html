But looking through the statistics, you will be annoyed to learn that many people still do not complete the purchase.  Is there a chance to convince the changed-over visitors?

      Today, we‚Äôll tell you how to use triggers to convince a customer to complete a purchase and make him an attorney for your brand. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Conviction stage </h3><br>  In <a href="https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate">67% of cases,</a> users drop the cart without completing an order.  According to the <a href="https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate">Baymard Institute</a> survey, unforeseen expenses that arise when placing an order, such as shipping or tax, are most often caused.  More rarely, potential buyers are deterred by the need to create an account on the site and the complicated process of making a purchase. <br><br>  If you are ready to fight for profit, set up trigger letters on an abandoned basket.  So that the user does not have time to forget about the product, send a letter with a reminder on the first day after the incomplete action. <br><br>  From the letter, give direct access to the basket, as in the example from Puma: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff7/7ab/792/ff77ab7922244b2ab893457e4b3e15ab.png"><br><br>  Experian, in its quarterly report, states that resending an abandoned shopping cart doubles transactions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/194/5d8/d27/1945d8d2730140789338ac3b25855a7a.png"><br><br>  SendPulse has a <a href="https://support.sendpulse.com/index.php%3Ftype%3Dpage%26urlcode%3D840299%26title%3D%25D0%25A4%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D1%258B%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25BC-">re-send</a> function <a href="https://support.sendpulse.com/index.php%3Ftype%3Dpage%26urlcode%3D840299%26title%3D%25D0%25A4%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D1%258B%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25BC-">for unreads</a> .  You just need to set the time of sending and the new subject of the letter, if the recipient did not open it the first time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/766/133/b6c/766133b6cb694bcba2bffaac7b0b75c1.png"><br><br>  <b><i>How to increase the conversion of a letter about an abandoned basket?</i></b> <br><br>  1. <i>Theme.</i>  The subject should reveal the essence of the letter, as here: <br>  <i>‚ÄúAlexander, you have forgotten the BNS12 toolkit in the basket</i> . <i>‚Äù</i> <br>  2. <i>Product photo.</i>  The photo in a fraction of a second will remind the subscriber of the goods left in the basket. <br>  3. <i>Call to action.</i>  Do not forget about a clear <a href="https://sendpulse.com/ru/blog/how-to-improve-your-cta">call to action</a> : "Place an order", "Pick up a pending product", "Go to purchase", etc. <br>  4. <i>Motivation to buy.</i>  Offer a discount or free shipping - this will be an additional incentive to complete the action. <br><br>  The letter about the abandoned basket from the Ozon.ru store has everything to return the subscriber to the purchase: images, discount and a clear call to action. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/208/b4b/6e1/208b4b6e19354d99ae86aa2f308f9e8c.png"><br><br><h3>  Stage of support of the transaction </h3><br><br>  Making a purchase, the subscriber becomes a client.  At this point, you have the opportunity to create an interaction experience for him that can lead to repeat business and turn a client into an attorney for your brand. <br><br>  The task of email marketing at this stage is to automate the process and reduce the involvement of the sales manager.  Let us consider in more detail how to automate customer support after a transaction using email newsletters. <br><br>  <b>Confirmation of an order</b> <br><br>  The first and main role of the confirmation letter is to inform about the status of the order.  Set up instant sending of the letter so that the buyer does not have an alarm caused by ignorance. <br><br>  Such <a href="https://support.sendpulse.com/index.php%3Ftype%3Dpage%26urlcode%3D726555%26title%3D%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA-%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%258C-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%2583%25D1%258E-%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D1%258B%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583">automatic mailings in SendPulse are</a> configured with a few clicks.  Just set the condition and time of sending.  The condition in this case will be the addition of the buyer to the appropriate address book, and the time of sending - immediately. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6db/9fe/b5b/6db9feb5b886405582b0306a1d3edbad.jpg"><br><br>  <i><b>What to specify in the order confirmation?</b></i> <br><br>  - number and date of order; <br>  - name of the purchased product or service; <br>  - delivery date; <br>  - payment amount. <br><br>  We took a good example of a confirmation letter from Booking.com.  In it you will find all the details of the reservation: the address and type of apartment, phone number, the number of persons booked for the apartment, time of arrival and departure, the final price.  There is a photograph of the apartments and a map. <br><br>  Booking.com brought us a familiar confirmation letter to a new level and in fact turned it into an extension of the site and personal profile.  Directly from the letter, you can change your reservation if you notice a mistake, or contact the apartment and print or save the confirmation on your mobile device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/36d/30f/1ed/36d30f1ed05741d0be31263761f977ce.png"><br><br>  <b>We offer related products, services</b> <br><br>  Cross sales (cross-sell) are invested in the classic sales funnel to increase the amount of the original order.  How to put this into practice, consider on the second letter, the chain from Booking.com. <br><br>  A week before the date of arrival, the service sends a reminder of the upcoming trip. <br>  In the email, the client is offered to order a taxi from the airport, book a bus or rent a car.  This is a cross-sell and customer care in one package, because if the customer has not yet managed to take care of the transfer to the hotel, he is given such an opportunity right in the mailbox. <br><br>  The compilers of the letter ask if you know that Frankfurt am Main is located nearby and are making a free guide to the traveler in this city.  If you decide to visit Frankfurt, the company will have another reservation in the neighboring city. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a3/d85/689/8a3d85689105409297fa63778c3c606f.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Delivery status</b> <br><br>  The better the customer is informed about the delivery status, the calmer he is.  And your brand will be associated with its reliability. <br><br>  Therefore, adopt the letter on the status of delivery.  In the example below, the letter notifying you that the order was sent.  In it, the buyer will find: <br><br>  1. The parcel number and a link to the website of the carrier, by which its status and location is tracked. <br>  2. Date, time of sending and receiving. <br><br>  In addition to these two points, from the letter there is a transition to the purchase of women's and men's clothing, which expands its function. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/759/e69/36f/759e6936f864413b99440436c5053192.png"><br><br>  <b>Request a review</b> <br><br>  When a customer has used the service or received his order, ask him to evaluate the quality.  So you show the client that you care about his opinion, and along the way you collect real feedback to optimize your product. <br><br>  Calculate the timing of sending a letter from the time that the buyer needs to form an opinion. <br><br>  Booking.com after the client‚Äôs departure from the apartment sends a recall request, completing the chain of trigger letters after booking.  ‚ÄúHow do you rate the location of the hotel?‚Äù The letter does not distract from the target action and contains only buttons: ‚ÄúBad‚Äù, ‚ÄúSatisfactory‚Äù, ‚ÄúGood‚Äù, ‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù.  All you have to do is make one click. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/144/b0b/15a/144b0b15a7224b7aac24f845d7c7a3f7.jpg"><br><br>  Camtasia asks to rate the service on a scale from 1 to 10. The letter also has social networking buttons for users to tell friends about it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9f7/297/96d/9f729796de974873ba539b5c70954ff2.png"><br><br>  If your letter consists of several questions and takes more time, keep in mind that people will not want to spend their time on them.  So offer something in return, as Toys R Us did. <br>  For writing a product review, Toys R Us offers to take part in a $ 250 gift card draw and includes step-by-step instructions: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/55f/fc6/a04/55ffc6a048d346cba977bb407bfc7a0b.png"><br><br>  With skillful use, trigger letters warm up leads, convince to make a deal and turn first customers into regular customers - the main thing is to correctly build a strategy and understand what your audience expects from you. <br><br>  SendPulse automatically increases the open rate of your mailings, calculating the optimal time and delivery channel.  <a href="https://sendpulse.com/ru">Register and send mailings to SendPulse</a> .
