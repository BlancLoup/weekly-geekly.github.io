For water and ice it is 0 ¬∞ C ( <i>if we discard the influence of atmospheric pressure and other factors</i> ).  In addition to phase transitions in thermodynamics, phase transitions can also be distinguished as applied to video games. <br><br>  In games and near-game fields, phase transitions are much less studied and often cannot boast of rigorous scientific evidence.  This effect is often referred to as ‚Äúcritical mass gain‚Äù. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3t/ur/nc/3turncyx4e1u33yviqgohua0lre.jpeg"></div>  <i>Picture Frequency of miracles [ <a href="https://www.thepoke.co.uk/2017/02/17/frequency-of-miracles/">2</a> ]</i>

      Further, we will consider illustrative examples of phase transitions and possible ways of working with them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The phase transitions are amazing and beautiful with their <i>abrupt state changes</i> upon reaching certain <i>constant threshold values</i> for controlling factors.  And it does not matter how these factors reached the threshold values: with a gradual uniform change of values ‚Äã‚Äãor sharp non-uniform jumps, the threshold values ‚Äã‚Äãof the phase transition will be the same.  I have this effect is a real delight.  And if I used to childhood glaciation, melting and boiling, and did not pay attention to it, then to less obvious examples I have deeply warm feelings. <br><br>  The whole dramatic effect of unknown / undetected phase transitions is manifested due to a number of their features: <br><br><ul><li>  The effect becomes noticeable rather late, when the damage is already done, and a lot of angry reviews from grateful fans appeared on the forums: ‚Äúthey did it on their knees‚Äù;  "Krivoruky developers";  "Spoiled everything." <br></li><li>  The transition from one phase to another occurs "instantly" after a small change in characteristics.  That is, for a long time, linear changes in the characteristics affect the entire game linearly and balancedly, but after another increase, the player suddenly gets an invincible hero or super-complicated boss.  And the game owners get a bored outgoing player or tons of hate on social networks. <br></li></ul><br><h3>  The growth of the main characteristics of the fighting characters </h3><br>  Imagine a standard melee warrior of level 1 with a loss of 50 units and a survivability of 50 units.  He fights with the enemies around him, for example, with a caterpillar with damage of 10 units with a survivability margin of 72 units.  Suppose a warrior always attacks first, and a crawler attacks in response. <br><br>  The log of such battles can be represented as follows: <br><blockquote>  1) Warrior hp (50), dmg (50) attacks Huckle no.1 hp (72) =&gt; hp (22), dmg (10) <br>  2) Crawler # 1 hp (22), dmg (10) attacks the Warrior hp (50) =&gt; hp (40), dmg (50) <br>  3) Warrior hp (40), dmg (50) attacks Gusenozhku number 1 hp (22) =&gt; hp (0), dmg (10) <br>  4) Warrior hp (40), dmg (50) attacks Gusenozhku number 2 hp (72) =&gt; hp (22), dmg (10) <br>  5) Crawler # 2 hp (22), dmg (10) attacks the Warrior hp (40) =&gt; hp (30), dmg (50) <br>  6) Warrior hp (30), dmg (50) attacks Gusenozhku number 2 hp (22) =&gt; hp (0), dmg (10) <br>  7) Warrior hp (30), dmg (50) as well as Gusenozhk number 3 hp (72) =&gt; hp (22), dmg (10) <br>  8) Crawler # 3 hp (22), dmg (10) attacks the Warrior hp (30) =&gt; hp (20), dmg (50) <br>  9) Warrior hp (20), dmg (50) attacks Gusenozhk number 3 hp (22) =&gt; hp (0), dmg (10) <br>  10) Warrior hp (20), dmg (50) attacks Gusenozhk # 4 hp (72) =&gt; hp (22), dmg (10) <br>  11) Crawler # 4 hp (22), dmg (10) attacks the Warrior hp (20) =&gt; hp (10), dmg (50) <br>  12) Warrior hp (10), dmg (50) attacks Gusenozhk # 4 hp (22) =&gt; hp (0), dmg (10) <br>  13) Warrior hp (10), dmg (50) retreats for treatment </blockquote>  Thus, the warrior will have time to destroy 4 gosenozhek, after which he will need treatment. <br><br>  Suppose with each new level a warrior receives a bonus of 5 points of damage and 5 points of survivability.  Based on these data, you can build a graph of the number of dead crawlers before the need for treatment (loss of time and resources): <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bb/qj/ia/bbqjiatzu_t3spitepq0fpjjuhs.png" alt="      " title="The dependence of the number of dead gosenozhek to the need for treatment"></div>  <i>The dependence of the number of dead gosenozhek to the need for treatment</i> <br><br>  That is, from the 6th level (when he will have 75 damage) the player can kill the crawlers with impunity and more than twice as fast.  stop taking damage from them.  Such an imbalance is quite easy to smooth out or eliminate, when the developer is dealing with 2-able characters.  When these characters become many dozens and each has a dozen different types of attacks, the developer will certainly face an imbalance in various combinations.  A twist of some parameters will lead to the emergence of new super characters. <br><br>  For example: <br><br>  A series of the South Park animated series ‚ÄúMake love, not Warcraft,‚Äù [ <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2597%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%258C_%25D0%25BB%25D1%258E%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%258C%25D1%258E,_%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5_Warcraft%25E2%2580%2599%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC">3</a> ], where the main characters were pumped on boars dying with one blow. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n2/5x/a1/n25xa1ppaqasf2tffkjif3qxmm0.jpeg" alt=" ,   Warcraft‚Äô" title="Make love, not Warcraft"></div>  <i>Boar Extermination - South Park</i> <br><br>  At the moment, came up with several ways to deal with this problem: <br><br><ul><li>  Creating <b>vulnerabilities of</b> different classes of characters like <b>rock-paper-scissors</b> , where it is critical (collisions with real players), and where uncritical (for example, in the case of NPC) - are simply ignored.  For example, a magician always defeats a warrior, a warrior always defeats a thief, a thief always defeats a magician.  Or system: water, fire, earth: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mz/av/av/mzavavz_gqkgw7ojirlz7fh0cju.jpeg"></div>  <i>Elemental stone-scissors-paper in Pokemon [ <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockpaperScissors">4</a> ]</i> <br><br>  This approach gives some confidence that even with a broken lazy balance, an unreasonably strong character will always have his own Achilles heel. <br></li><li>  Increase the strength of <b>opponents in proportion to the strength of the player</b> .  So, for example, come in the games Oblivion and Skyrim.  Although Skyrim did it not so clumsy and almost imperceptibly.  But Oblivion received a fair share of ‚Äúpeople's love‚Äù for its auto-reliance: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fb/e4/lf/fbe4lfe0k65d9vdtmsdo1khhiry.jpeg" alt="  Skyrim &amp; Oblivion" title="Skeletons in Skyrim &amp; Oblivion"></div>  <i>Auto-leasing in Skyrim &amp; Oblivion [ <a href="http://tes.reactor.cc/post/2105646">5</a> ]</i> <br><br></li><li>  Hide the problem with <b>fences restrictions</b> .  This is perhaps the most lazy approach.  It lies in the fact that the imbalance can be hidden if you block access to it.  Thus, restrictions are used on the minimum and maximum level of the hero on: use of equipment;  access to locations and quests;  the inability to attack another player with a significant difference in levels. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fj/w1/sf/fjw1sfclbby9jwmm3rlud6dpc8w.jpeg"></div>  <i>Limiting locations to hero levels in Darkest Dungeon [ <a href="http://www.archives.darkestdungeon.com/topic/a-story-about-someone-new-in-the-game/">6</a> ]</i> <br><br></li><li>  <b>Depreciation</b> .  The method consists in the fact that for easily accessible achievements a minimum reward is given.  For example, for a victory over Gusenozhka, warriors of the 6th level and above stop getting experience.  Or an older way: an exponential growth of the required amount of experience for levelap.  Or both of these approaches at once.  Thus, the use of imbalance loses all meaning for the player.  This method is used, for example, in games Newerwinter Nigts 2, here is a table of the required experience to enhance: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/di/e8/tr/die8treum3wueav7qn5cguvgbpk.png"></div>  <i>Chart of experience required for upgrading to Neverwinter Nights 2 [ <a href="http://nwn2.wikia.com/wiki/Character_progression">7</a> ]</i> <br><br>  It is unlikely that there are many willing to destroy 4750 goblins with 4 units of experience to get a promotion from the 19th level to the 20th. <br></li></ul><br><h3>  Search for dominant strategy </h3><br>  Dominant strategy is a situation in which one of the strategies of a player gives a greater gain than the other in any actions of his opponents [ <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_(%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580)">8</a> ].  The emergence of dominant strategies is inevitable, but developers can weaken them, bringing the gameplay to a more balanced state. <br><br>  Examples of phase transitions in dominant strategies: <br><br><ul><li>  1. Hearthstone [ <a href="https://playhearthstone.com/">9</a> ].  This is a multiplayer card game from Blizzard, in which strategies with ‚Äúendless damage‚Äù are constantly emerging.  One of the most striking examples is the ‚Äúinfinite‚Äù generation of fireballs for 0 mana. <br>  The phase transition line here is a combination of the laid out cards: <br><br>  - one Archmage Antonidas, who puts a Fireball in his hand for 4 mana after the player plays any spell; <br>  - Four pupils magician, which reduce the cost of spells by 1 for each student; <br>  - any spell to start generating fireball creation. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/78cK9UXQ_4Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Hearthstone is a combo of endless fireballs for 0 mana [ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D78cK9UXQ_4Y">10</a> ].</i> <br><br>  The only limitation of such a strategy becomes time, during which it is necessary to have time to lay out the strategy and finish off the enemy, which does not allow to call this strategy completely unlimited.  Game developers periodically cover up the possibility of the execution of this strategy, but it is with enviable stubbornness reborn with the help of new combinations.  This strategy initially broke the game balance, but with the help of improvements of developers it became quite difficult to implement, so the balance was restored (using this strategy simply lose before they can realize it). <br></li><li>  2. Slay the Spire [ <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/">11</a> ].  This is a roguelike-like single-player card game.  In it, as in Hearthstone, you can create endless strategies.  The phase transition line in such strategies is a stable combination of cards throughout the player's deck - when there are all the necessary cards and there are no extra ones that could interrupt the chain of endless repetition of the winning strategy. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jrkhLuroyzg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Slay the Spire - a steady endless combo of 2 cards [ <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/">12</a> ]</i> <br><br>  Players have discovered several similar strategies.  There is probably no broken balance, because  The whole game design is based on creating such super strategies so that you can win in the end.  In addition, the randomness of the generated environment prevents the collection of such combinations on an ongoing basis. <br></li></ul><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  In conclusion, I would like to give an excellent quote from the article ‚ÄúLevel 16: Game Balance‚Äù by Ian Schreiber [ <a href="https://gamedesignconcepts.wordpress.com/2009/08/20/level-16-game-balance/">13</a> ] <i>(in general, the whole site contains a very interesting series of articles about game balance from different points of view)</i> . <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">The Role of Balance - the original</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The Role of Balance <br><br>  I was very passionate about the game balance.  ‚ÄúThis is a fun game‚Äù was my mantra.  I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve got them right now.  Such is the privilege of youth. <br><br>  While I still take a more moderate line.  Spite of being unbalanced.  I've seen other games that are intentionally unbalanced.  I have seen it astoundingly well in the marketplace, despite having egregious imbalances.  These are rare and special cases.  But he didn‚Äôt want to take priority over the ultimate design goals.  Let these techniques be your tools, not your master. <br></div></div><br><blockquote>  The role of balance <i>(transfer)</i> <br>  In my early years as a game designer, I was completely uncompromising in terms of game balance.  ‚ÄúAn interesting game is a balanced game, and a balanced game is an interesting game,‚Äù was my mantra.  I have no doubt that I annoyed many of my senior colleagues with my ranting about the deficiencies in the balance in our games, and why we should correct them immediately.  Ah, youthful maximalism. <br><br>  Although I still believe that the ability to find balance is an important and key skill of any game designer, I now adhere to a more tolerant point of view.  I met games that were interesting despite the fact that they were unbalanced.  I met games that were interesting precisely because they were deliberately disturbed by the balance.  I even met a few games that were surprisingly successful, despite the fact that there was just a glaring imbalance in the gameplay.  Although it is worth noting that these are very rare and specific cases.  So let it serve you as a reminder that all the methods and approaches that I have voiced should not prevail over the main goals of your game.  Let these approaches to achieve balance be your means, not the end. </blockquote><br><h3>  Sources of literature </h3><br><ol><li>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4">Phase transition in thermodynamics</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.thepoke.co.uk/2017/02/17/frequency-of-miracles/">Picture Frequency of miracles</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2597%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%258C_%25D0%25BB%25D1%258E%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%258C%25D1%258E,_%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5_Warcraft%25E2%2580%2599%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC">Series of the animated series South Park "Make love, not Warcraft'om"</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockpaperScissors">Elemental stone-scissors-paper in Pokemon</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://tes.reactor.cc/post/2105646">Auto-leasing at Skyrim &amp; Oblivion</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.archives.darkestdungeon.com/topic/a-story-about-someone-new-in-the-game/">Limit locations to hero levels in Darkest Dungeon</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://nwn2.wikia.com/wiki/Character_progression">The table of experience required to improve in Neverwinter Nights 2</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_(%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580)">Dominant Strategy - Wikipedia</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://playhearthstone.com/">Hearthstone official website</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D78cK9UXQ_4Y">Hearthstone - combo of endless fireballs - Youtube</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/">Slay the Spire</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/">Slay the Spire - steady endless combo of 2 cards</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://gamedesignconcepts.wordpress.com/2009/08/20/level-16-game-balance/">Level 16: Game Balance and Ian Schreiber series of balance articles</a> </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/426927/">https://habr.com/ru/post/426927/</a></p>
