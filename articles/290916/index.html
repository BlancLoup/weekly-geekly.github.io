    <pre>  Tuk  Tuk  Tuk  Tuk </pre>  "The main thing is not to break," I thought.  I tapped a pencil on the table rhythmically.  "And breathe evenly."  Tuk  Tuk  Tuk  ‚ÄúThis sun is still baking.  No strength".  Tuk  Tuk  Tuk  "Air conditioning forever no money at the office."  Knock Knock.  Tuk  ‚ÄúAnd these stupid managers.  Banal things do not know.  Understanding the sale process is not.  Not just no.  A completely absent.  From the word ABSOLUTELY. "  "So.  Breathe, breathe. <br><br>  So I thought back in 2009 <br><br>  I was the head of the sales department in one federal office.  And sales were sluggish.  And although I made every effort to motivate the staff, develop KPI, train, chew the whole process, those sales were not in a hurry to grow in my department.  It was necessary to change something.  But so what?  Staff?  Sales approach?  Marketing policy?  Pricing policy?  Most of all I was frustrated by our current CRM system.  It seems to be how it was available, but the effectiveness of its presence was minimal.  There simply were fixed customers and sales.  With my differentiated approach to assessing the salesman‚Äôs work, such a system was just a 5m wheel.  I understood.  It is necessary to put a good, flexible, functional CRM, which will not slow down the work, taking up 15% of the time for stupid filling in the fields, but helping to sell, prompting the manager.  To assist him in finding relevant customers under the current price offers.  And help me in assessing employee performance. <br><br>  And other, other, other.  I realized what I missed.  I came to the current place when CRM was already standing.  And the choice could not affect.  And now I will pick up a REALLY working tool!  I started analyzing the CRM market. <br><br>  My requirements: <br><br><pre>  It is desirable WEB-version to immediately start work, even with a thin client. </pre><br><pre>  At the head of everything - the client, and all his "Wishlist." </pre>  I should be able to sort by all sorts of fields, search by text, make selections by region, industry.  I wanted to choose customers by EVERYTHING, i.e.  In general, all parameters.  According to the secretary's eyes.  In length ... hm ... car boss.  The height of the office building.  THROUGHOUT! <br><pre>  The second place of importance for me is the staff. </pre>  My employees must "live" in CRM.  To issue invoices, make payments, form applications, discuss a client on the forum, operate files on the current transaction (attach instructions, for example, or a certificate). <br><pre>  My place is at the helm. </pre>  ‚ÄúAccounting and control,‚Äù as the great leader said.  One cannot but agree.  I wanted to see not only all the actions of employees, but also analytical calculations on these actions.  I wanted to know the correlation between the number of KP sent, calls made and the amount of the transaction.  I wanted to understand why one employee is more efficient and brings 30% of revenue to the department, and another, with the same effort, cannot make 10%.  Although visually they work equally hard.  The ideal would be a dashboard with a bunch of cool indicators.  One look at which would give me an understanding of the whole picture in my department.  Plans, their implementation in rubles and interest.  Revenue.  Active deals.  Deadly deals.  And so on. <br><pre>  Plus were a variety of "integration" </pre>  They are not primary, but make life easier.  Mass mailings, telephony, financial analysis, company knowledge base. <br><br>  Making a list of my requirements, I began an active search for a candidate.  The results, to put it mildly, ‚Äúwere not impressed‚Äù.  The despondency of the market was passed on to me.  The market was represented by 3 types of products: <br><ul><li>  <b>Monsters</b> .  You yourself know their name.  "Dynamics".  The cost of a seat is from 750 Baku commissars.  Plus introduction.  About as many more.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no money for air conditioning.  Not to mention the 6 jobs in CRM, ‚ÄùI thought.  And the monsters went to scare others with their prices. </li><li>  <b>Foreign localization.</b>  These are different vTigerCRM and their ilk.  I had high hopes for them.  In vain.  Work with the Russian language in these products stood, if not in the fifth, then in third place for sure.  I thought I could handle it.  Naive.  A stupid search for a company by name caused such hemorrhoids.  Products simply refused to sort companies by name in the correct order.  The sort looked like this: AZ, everything else in a bunch.  In addition, Russian is about 1.5 times longer than English.  And the button with the words ‚ÄúAdd client‚Äù turned into ‚ÄúExt.  of the client ‚Äùand still the letters climbed the boundaries of a button or menu and blew my perfectionist brain with their appearance.  After tormenting for a couple of months, I threw out all hopes to wait for normal localization. </li><li>  <b>Domestic development</b> .  SalesExpert, TerraSoft, 1C: CRM.  These "crafts" not only did not fall under the point 1 of my wishes, but were also clearly written by programmers for programmers.  The head of the sales department apparently advised developers only on SMS.  Yes, and some, apparently, reached "beaten."  Linear perception of reality.  Lack of understanding of the essence of sales and the needs of salespeople.  It's just like a rake.  Customer-contact-transaction.  Of course, there is a distinction of rights.  Of course there is a calendar.  But this is all too straightforward.  I needed tuning tools.  It also offered a chisel and a hammer. </li></ul><br><br>  Looking at the whole zoo, I realized that I could not see happiness.  But, as you know, every smith of his own happiness.  And I made a crazy decision: I will make my own CRM.  Himself.  For myself.  The way I understand the sales process, staff motivation and control of the sales department. <br><br>  At the moment, <a href="http://yoolla.ru/">YoollaCRM has</a> almost completely fulfilled all my dreams of a perfect CRM.  She answers all the points of my hotelok.  Somewhere more, somewhere less.  But I know for sure that this CRM is written by a sales person for salespeople.  I am inspired by the experience of the developers of the notorious <a href="http://rosegardenmusic.com/">Rosegarden</a> , who, having found no instrument for their own music making, wrote their own, so much so that he became the best in his class.  And, although, at the moment, a huge number of players (Bitrix, Megaplan, Naumen, AmoSRM, FreshOffice, etc.) are getting involved in the game, I still feel as though I am in 2009. Players create products that are either primitive (to ‚Äúbe closer‚Äù but in reality they solve 2 or 3 tasks and are no longer suitable, but everything is covered up with an ‚Äúair‚Äù design), or they are monstrous and include the well-known card game and famous women. <br><br>  I still see that Yoolla solves sales problems only with smart executives.  Those who want to think.  There is no design for the sake of design.  In it, each pixel of the screen is filled with information for decision.  It does not have beautiful large avatars, bubble dialogs and responsive design for the iPhone.  But it has everything that I wanted in 2009 and what professional salespeople want in 2015. Analytics (50+ reports), samples for an infinite number of criteria, personal presentation of lists, indicators for the entire desktop that meet you in the morning.  One look at them, and you understand who today "does not go to the grandmother."  A lot has been done and a lot more to do.  The market is changing and Yoolla is changing with it.  But the main "ridge" of the system remains unchanged.  Here I will tell you about it in the following articles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f4b/4c2/ca1/f4b4c2ca1fd242288b23b826c1a91305.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Who is not familiar with our product - please join.  We will listen to your feedback.  Just ask in the comments to write who you are by profession so that it does not work out like this: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a sales manager, but the circle in the left corner doesn‚Äôt fit in my mind with a blue frame and text.‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290916/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290916/</a></p>
