Although, as an example, we were told about the recent completion of a pilot project for equipping ambulances with means that allow doctors to have fast wireless Internet access to obtain the necessary data, for example, to decipher an ECG or to transmit some information directly to the hospital. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eae/471/dc1/eae471dc1d317d4b7dae6d41ee7e63f1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I have repeatedly talked about the company's initiatives in the field of education - these include various programs (‚Äú <a href="http://www.intel.com/cd/corporate/education/emea/rus/421287.htm">1 student - 1 computer</a> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <a href="http://www.intel.com/cd/corporate/education/emea/rus/elem_sec/programs/learn/373611.htm">Learning from Intel</a> ‚Äù), creating personal computers for elementary school students (I already did a review of two models - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/99136/">one</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/68390/">two</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/99230/">three</a> ), teacher training (the course ‚Äú <a href="http://www.intel.com/cd/corporate/education/emea/rus/elem_sec/programs/teach/373610.htm">Training for the Future</a> ‚Äù? In more than 7 years, more than 620,000 teachers across Russia have passed!), the creation of educational projects - you can learn more about all this by visiting the third ‚Äúgalaxy‚Äù - <a href="http://edugalaxy.intel.ru/"><b>Education Galaxy</b></a> .  At home, sitting in a chair, you can argue and argue on this topic for a long time, but the fact is a fact - the effectiveness of this vector of development, its importance and innovativeness were appreciated by many universities and educational development institutions, and the company continues to make a useful contribution to development of the country.  Now at the federal level, agreements have been signed on a revolutionary change in the education process (in elementary classes) - so far there are only three such agreements (Novosibirsk, Nizhny Novgorod and St. Petersburg - in these cities more than half of primary education can be started in a new format), but the rest of the cities are not far off. ;  The question of a serious modernization of infrastructure and training materials is now much more acute, but much of this does not depend on the company anymore. <br><br>  But what surprised us most was what we saw with our own eyes.  Namely, the children's computer club <b>Intel Computer Clubhouse</b> is the only computer club from Intel in Russia;  in Moscow there is no, but in Nizhny there is) On the day of our arrival the club had a <a href="">five-year anniversary</a> , on the occasion of which we were invited to the celebrations. <br>  The club does not give to play computer games or sit down pants on social networks - all this, if desired, can be done at home.  They teach children of all ages the basics of working on a computer. <br><br>  Some statistics: <br>  - More than 60 programs are studied (I don‚Äôt know what scale and at what level) <br>  - Pupils created 3 socially significant projects <br>  - The total "mouse mileage" for all the time amounted to tens of thousands of kilometers :) <br>  - In all this, 30 volunteers from 15 countries participate <br>  - In the press there were more than 200 mentions of the club, 25 video spots on TV <br>  - A huge amount of thanks from different people - from the governors to the parents of the children.  By the way, the club has such a subprogram ‚ÄúComputer, grandmother and me‚Äù - when children, after visiting the club, try to ‚Äúcomputerize‚Äù their grandmothers, thanks were also from them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8b9/dbc/27f/8b9dbc27fd51a76ec1b4502852330f35.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  All these words, I also had the chance to "honestly" speak directly with the club members, that is, with the children.  Usually in such situations I was only sorry for the children, but this time there was a complete break in the pattern - the children excitedly talked about how to make robots from LEGO, program them, and so on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8bd/518/df1/8bd518df1db684fe46ab0d9b1f631a84.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I involuntarily remembered my childhood, stories about the childhood of my parents ... yes, of course we didn‚Äôt have that) But this is logical.  The children showed several radio-controlled robots (assembled according to the instructions and one ‚Äúindependent‚Äù), which rolled and, thanks to various sensors, were able to distinguish and name colors, move along a ‚Äúcolor trajectory‚Äù, etc.  - and all this with a genuine shine in the eyes of children! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/def/cde/c3b/defcdec3b520a76f56386db70e065e27.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Photo author Sergey Vilyanov</i> <br><br>  If we had such a club, I would not hesitate to give my child there after a couple of years - he will always have time to play toys on the computer. <br><br>  In conclusion, the regional management of the company presented a certificate ($ 10,000) for the development of the club - it remains to be hoped that all this will go in the right direction.  In any case, it's nice to know that Intel is not only processors, chipsets and platforms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b19/fd0/e2f/b19fd0e2f9346e45598ca61d1288834c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Tired but satisfied, we returned home.  Nizhny Novgorod is a beautiful city! <br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/107033/">https://habr.com/ru/post/107033/</a></p>
