  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review of iOS 7 Beta 2 on iPad</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Just recently, the release of iOS 7 Beta 2 took place. As promised, there was support for the iPad, starting from the second generation. <br>  Impressions of the first use are rather ambiguous: on the one hand, quite interesting features appeared, such as a control point, which allows you to enable or disable a certain function quickly and with a minimum number of tapes;  and on the other hand, quite useless, for example, the same parallax effect (which is now called ‚Äúin the settings‚Äù), dynamic wallpaper that does not carry any useful functionality, but only a dubious decoration. <br><br>  Most of the innovations made in the first beta version, has already been <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/182932/">reviewed</a> on Habr√©, but only for the iPhone.  Now a similar review will be based on the iPad. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Main interface </h3><br>  Upgrading from version 6.1.3 was pretty painless and quick. <br>  After installation, the standard initial setup procedure.  Unfortunately, I forgot to take pictures, so I will describe the configuration steps after the update with words: 
      <br>

      <br>
    <ol><li>  Enter PIN </li><li>  Language selection </li><li>  Offer to set a password with the ability to connect iCloud KeyChain </li></ol><br><br>  Then, literally within a few seconds, the homescreen of iOS appears to our eyes (the pictures are clickable): <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/df1/e74/7ed/df1e747ed690dd24fc9670abade5bf43.png"></a> <br><br>  Significant changes from the previous beta on the iPhone is not noticed. <br><br><hr><br>  Alert Center: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dc6/809/be2/dc6809be205e2a2d02dfcd86a7403faa.png"></a> <br><br>  Command centre: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e41/0d6/605/e410d6605dd6fed01c2d22f70045b5c9.png"></a> <br><br>  It is worth noting that there is a lack of some of the functions available on the iPhone, such as a flashlight and a calculator (due to their fundamental absence).  Also slightly changed the icon of the application "Timer" <br><br><hr><br>  Spotlight (which is no longer to the left of the main screen, but called up by swipe down on any of the screens): <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4cb/3ff/af1/4cb3ffaf1085b101100bc30430d43d45.png"></a> <br><br>  Lock screen: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e0e/d0c/6a6/e0ed0c6a6fd534a2c5d7bc222f51f1f1.png"></a> <br><br>  You can now call the camera by pulling the lower right corner (where the camera icon is located) <br><br><hr><br>  Multitasking: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/582/d2c/463/582d2c463153bf84b31d6a203d6ffa0a.png"></a> <br><br>  In the iPad version, as I believe, it was quite possible to expand the number of simultaneously displayed applications to five.  The feature of simultaneous completion of several tasks works (svayp up several applications at the same time), but due to the large size of the screen of the iPad - this is slightly inconvenient. <br><br><h3>  Standard Applications </h3><br>  Stopwatch: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4b5/29d/4dc/4b529d4dc472954bda2a7003a13bcbe7.png"></a> <br><br>  Timer (in my opinion, it looks better than in the previous beta): <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e6a/63f/9e7/e6a63f9e7f3d9d96e952fdcd0c7ba90e.png"></a> <br><br>  Camera: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7bd/285/a50/7bd285a50798a16c014989c6bf4a1fd3.png"></a> <br><br>  Traditionally, there is no panoramic shooting mode and the effects of ‚ÄúHello, Instagram‚Äù (although the photo in the form of a square is still present, although it is not clear for what purpose) <br>  As you can see, HDR shooting mode has appeared.  With the default settings, two pictures are saved on the device - the original and HDR directly.  Rumor has it that the quality of the shooting was improved, but in fact I did not notice the differences. <br>  Shooting modes are switched by swipe up / down the side panel. <br><br>  A few examples: <br><ul><li>  <a href="">Standard photo without HDR</a> </li><li>  <a href="">Standard HDR photo</a> </li><li>  <a href="">Mode "Square"</a> </li></ul><br><br>  You may notice that the photo in the "Square" mode remains with the usual aspect ratio.  However, on the device itself, the photos are displayed as intended (possibly a bug, but most likely a feature): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/893/bc5/705/893bc57053ef5e35a1ade11cf3157426.png"><br><br><hr><br>  ITunes: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/de2/0fb/02c/de20fb02c3bb26a1969b1253f5501cb1.png"></a> <br><br>  It looks very sad compared to the iPhone, it is unclear even why the icons were removed - here they definitely do not take up much space, but they give a certain completeness to the bottom menu. <br>  Type "we played with fonts" in the top menu - here even the words are no longer needed. <br>  Genius is missing in the AppStore - this move is also completely unclear. <br><br><hr><br>  Player: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/853/218/7aa/8532187aa9a46cf399f4d5e25042bcc2.png"></a> <br><br>  When playback is turned on, loxcreen also changes - now there is INSTEAD of the clock the player control and the album cover are displayed: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/365/0f3/1cb/3650f31cbdb09efcd25d6870381c835f.png"></a> <br><br>  A photo: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9d5/4fc/557/9d54fc557fa0aed0a7e85e7a981fb521.png"><br><br>  There was quite an interesting grouping by the location of the photos taken.  For some cases it is very convenient. <br><br><hr><br>  Safari: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a18/1d9/250/a181d925004e325078be446c9c13f3fd.png"></a> <br><br>  Appearance is very different from Safari on the iPhone, although due to the larger available area for display, this solution is more convenient. <br><br>
<h3>  A bit of criticism </h3><br><ul><li>  First of all, I would like to express a huge FU to the one who designed the design of notes.  Links have become completely unreadable. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bca/bec/85a/bcabec85a75aba7d7a309fffba3c7f01.png"><br>  And, although something else can be seen in the picture, it is almost impossible to distinguish it on the screen with a bright backlight. </li><li>  Although this is a beta version, it is very embarrassing to go to respring when viewing standard applications (which is not observed in third-party applications). </li><li>  It is not at all clear for whom and why ‚Äúlive wallpapers‚Äù and the parallax effect (except for indulging Android users) are invented.  They do not provide useful functionality, a casual observer is almost imperceptible (if you do not poke your nose).  In general, they can be described as "useless battery eaters." </li><li>  Why remove watches from Lockscreen when a user listens to music?  Can anyone explain at least one useful factor in this action? </li></ul><br><br>  If anything else interests - ask, do not hesitate. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/184650/">https://habr.com/ru/post/184650/</a></p>
