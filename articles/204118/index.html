At one time, the tariff even did a joint - "Doctrine of 77" was called.  Now <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ekaterinaturtseva/" class="user_link">EkaterinaTurtseva has</a> arrived to visit, we will talk about gadgets. <br><br>  I keep the old models, recharge them.  I have a whole prophylaxis for them, because they are connected with the history of my life.  For example, I tenderly store Philips Xenium - a clamshell with a battery that was fierce for those times, which actually held a charge for 2 weeks.  Few people know that the development of design for this model did some respectable Europeans.  And when I came to Spain under the punishing hand and left without money, documents, this phone alone was.  Good thing he kept for so long. <br><br>  Here is another interesting device with a characteristic pattern:

I had an iPhone, two more, in my opinion, then a triple.  And so I carried my iPhine to the jeweler.  And I say: ‚ÄúMake me a cover.  So I brought you a double, lockable cover with the "Hunchback".  Measure and cut the gum, and make it like an old-fashioned cigarette case. ‚Äù  They took.  What is amazing?  That after some time I went with my daughter to pick up work.  So, in addition to casting a massive silver cigarette case, on top of the dragon they made a sapphire.  I say: "Guys, how much do I owe?" - "10 kopecks."  And they did not take more. <br><br><h4>  Why i collect them </h4><br>  A gadget is more than a piece of hardware.  There and their personal contacts, and music folder.  I even, I remember, offered to do the transfer in due time, ‚ÄúMy favorite songs‚Äù or ‚ÄúFlash Drive‚Äù is called.  The idea was this: you call a person to yourself, and you and him look at what is in his Favorite Music folder.  And with each tune there is a story from his life.  Suppose that I always have ‚ÄúMatia Bazar‚Äù, the album ‚ÄúAristocratica‚Äù - under it I left for the army. <br><br>  I give old phones to children when they break their own, but then I take these historical gadgets back so they don‚Äôt kill them.  After all, one way or another, every gadget is connected with something. <br><br>  I have always envied people who have been shabby with a single phone for years.  They go with him, right here in the buzz they talk.  They have all the contacts in it, and they, therefore, despite the broken glass, continue to speak, although they can afford another, new one.  Or it happens that people wear some old Samsung: colorful, ugly.  I know an example: an adult man, already bald, wears a pink Samsung, a cot, cannot refuse him, because it is convenient for him to open it in his car with his mouth. <br><br>  And I'm like a maniac.  When a new model is burning, I somehow test it all, do something with it, master it. <br><br>  By the way, for which I respect Euroset, they never asked to lie in advertising.  They give the model, and you take the phone, you install everything honestly, you look at how the signal is received, how the loop antenna works, how the battery behaves - and so for several days.  I perform a full cycle, that is, I completely discharge the batteries, everything is written as it should be.  I do everything that a 10th grader usually does with a phone when I receive a new gadget as a gift.  That is, I throw, if on Android, my favorite tunes, my favorite movies.  Then I rewrite the contacts by hand.  It's easier with the iPhone, iCloud is there, so it‚Äôs easy to drop everything back and forth.  For me, this is a kind of meditation before shooting an advertisement. <br><br><h4>  How did it start </h4><br>  My first gadget was a Casio watch.  There was a notebook and a calculator.  In those days it was space.  I bought them for a part of the fee from some kind of script.  In general, I have always loved watches, and now I have many hours.  This is such a hoarding hoard.  There are ‚Äúweekend‚Äù watches that are on shooting, there are those that I will distribute to children later, and there are just loved ones.  For example, we have the same Oksanka with stones, they seem modest, but accurate, and the mechanism is wonderful - ET-750 with improvements.  Pocket watch is, pieces 3-4.  My grandfather gave me the first watch.  He broke the bow, whether it was "Glory", or "Victory", or "Rocket".  I put them under the pillow, they gurgled there.  It was, of course, something. <br><br>  The first phone was the Ericsson.  From the magazine "Capital" I was given.  In those days, it was also a luxury.  Then I bought my Nokia 3210, then I went through all of Nokia almost.  For all you can not walk, but on the basic models.  Then I got the Ericsson in such a rubberized metal casing.  Between them, I mainly had Nokia - 8800, 8810. Two zeros with two batteries, the battery sat down there, and as a result, in Cyprus, I broke it on the rock, I was tired of charging it three times. <br><br><h4>  About children </h4><br>  People often ask if they give phones to children.  And with children just.  They were already born in the era of gadgets and do not romanticize them.  Of course, they first go through the stage of toys and dodging from her mother's gaze in order to secretly play to sagging cheeks and red eyes.  Then stories on VKontakte, Facebook, girls, boys, chat.  Then it also fades, is minimized to a certain extent, there is only mail and some kind of social network where you systematically support your audience. <br><br><h4>  About collection </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/14f/bd9/066/14fbd9066040c479a6cd29ba271b07b0.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Well, if you're interested, I will show my collection of phones and generally tell you what I have and where the gadgets and devices are. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/204118/">https://habr.com/ru/post/204118/</a></p>
