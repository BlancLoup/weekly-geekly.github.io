Thank you all!  One of the main questions we discussed in the comments was: how do you get people to write reviews?  Therefore, I decided to publish an article on this topic. <br><br>  Feedback on consumer products can be a powerful tool to increase sales, but it is of little use if you cannot persuade your consumers to leave feedback after contacting you.  So that you can use your product reviews to your advantage, you need consumers ready to carve out 5 minutes in your schedule to let you know what they really think.  Here is how you can convince them that it is worth their time and effort: <br><a name="habracut"></a>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <ul><li>  Offer a small discount for the next purchase to those consumers who, after receiving the product, filled out a feedback form about it.  This is guaranteed to lead you to the desired results: who refuses to save money?  Just do not promise more discounts than you can afford.  It‚Äôs one thing to offer a 25-50% discount on your next purchase to anyone who is willing to spend 5 minutes of your time on it, and quite another to watch your profits melt after this discount has actually been used. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Offer consumers the following: if they fill out a feedback form, you include their contacts on the mailing list to receive further discounts and coupons.  You have already seen this: "Answer three simple questions about your purchase - and get on our mailing list to receive discount coupons and special offers."  In addition, the bulk of your consumers are probably pretty stingy at heart;  if they were really satisfied with the purchase, they will be happy to save money in the future (hint: tell them what you will send, and, if possible, show the previous newsletter so that your messages are not mistaken for spam). </li></ul><br><ul><li>  To make money, be prepared to spend it.  Many companies provide professional reviews of consumer products;  for a fee, they will study your products and leave professional reviews on your site.  If from such a perspective you are trembling - relax.  So many companies do.  The person who made the review receives a free product and another $ 15-20 bargain, and you get a good review, which is not a shame to show your repeat customers.  As a result, everyone wins! </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Do not forget when registering consumers in your forum to request their contact information - then you can contact them in cases of receiving negative feedback.  But do not overdo it.  Enough email address, and your clientele will be more confident that you do not have secret plans to spam their mailboxes. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  When contacting consumers, attach a product feedback form and a website address where they can post a consumer product review.  Although such surveys are often sent straight to the basket, yet you will always find someone who has a desire to answer them - and each completed questionnaire will be your additional "trump card up the sleeve." </li></ul><br><br>  Many consumers, at the sight of a request to leave a comment on a product, frown in displeasure and think: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have time for that‚Äù.  And here you will have to think about how to dissuade them.  Such tricks and tactics will be the beginning of your success. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77409/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77409/</a></p>
