The set of requirements is quite expected - small size, convenient operation and good quality of shooting.  The recently released AdvoCam-FD2 Mini-GPS, which marks the given niche set of queries, has come into my hands.  Therefore, immediately I hasten to share my impressions of the operation of this new product. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/53b/2c4/357/53b2c4357819ed148100a645690d338d.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  To begin with, it should be clarified that, according to the tradition of the brand, we were offered two versions of the device.  One contains a GPS model and, accordingly, is capable of recording the speed and coordinates of the movement of a car.  I admit, I do not treat fans of this feature.  Just for these consumers, AdvoCam has provided a ‚Äúregular‚Äù version without GPS.  In this case, all the features of the registrar itself and the configuration remain the same.  I can say this at least because I had both boxes on hand :)

      <b>Equipment</b> <br><br>  The brand did not provide us with a huge amount of information, as was the case with the recently reviewed by me AdvoCam-FD5.  The data on the packaging tells us that the kit includes a 4 GB memory card, and how much emphasis is placed on the miniature dimensions of the recorder.  And weight - 58 grams. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8fa/dbd/93a/8fadbd93a5baa884321de676080b0504.jpg"><br><br>  Inside there are no surprises, the delivery is more than standard.  With the exception of one thing, the disk containing the installation file of the player program is attached.  Directly to the installer "sewn up" installation of the K-Lite Mega Codec Pack.  For prosharennyh users this is unnecessary, but drivers far from computers will not interfere. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9fd/877/0a7/9fd8770a7c4d507ab0c86f57fb0d0e76.jpg"><br><br>  Next, we see a miniUSB cable, a small instruction book with high-quality printing, a bracket and power from the cigarette lighter.  For the last AdvoCam from me personally, "Respect" - for the length of the cable offhand reaches about 3-4 meters.  Simply put, cable motivates a priori to civilized installation under the skin.  I would say something like ‚Äúis it different?‚Äù.  But in reality I constantly come across cases when the cable hangs down from the recorder directly to the cigarette lighter. <br><br>  <b>Mount</b> <br><br>  Separately, I will highlight a couple of paragraphs about the bracket, since this thing plays an important role in the use of the recorder.  Once again, AdvoCam did not move away from the rightly chosen vector for the installation of a swivel.  Therefore, the model holder is generally devoid of the screw mechanisms for adjusting the position of the camera.  In addition, there is no additional screw for adjusting the hinge stiffness.  The ‚Äúball‚Äù by default moves in such a way that it is not necessary to put special efforts under the ‚Äúmanual influence‚Äù.  The rest of the time, the bracket does not suffer from vibration and unauthorized ‚Äúadjustment‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8d1/b1f/4d3/8d1b1f4d330f9958751d65e79a83efad.jpg"><br><br>  A small minus, specifically the GPS version, is that the module is built right into the bracket.  The fact is that in AdvoCam-FD5 Profi-GPS unit with a GPS-receiver could be installed in the bracket at will.  Although in fairness - the dimensions of the "superstructure" almost does not affect. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f90/85e/40b/f9085e40b4e22c5789d17401539de621.jpg"><br><br>  I liked that in AdvoCam-FD2 Mini-GPS there is no tight latch for fixing or loosening the vacuum suction cup.  Instead, you should easily turn the lever-mounted GPS unit to secure the holder to the glass. <br><br>  <b>Appearance, controls</b> <br><br>  I think many have already guessed what inspired the designers when developing the model.  At first glance, it is clear that the recorder is made in the "vintage" style and frankly "mows down" for Soviet cameras.  Not the worst way to make a model individual.  The body is made of "a little" glossy plastic.  By virtue of how to say this, the abundance of elements of marquis do not think at all.  There, where I often touched the case with my hands, go narrow strips of plastic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d7a/f32/b13/d7af32b137bd49ee8797d13a300215e5.jpg"><br><br>  The rough protrusion again looks ‚Äúantique‚Äù on the lower left of the camera.  At this angle, the user holds his hand when working with the recorder or changes its position.  I will clarify that this pad is - and it is not rubber.  Just a successful "engraving" on the plastic.  Since I started from the front side, I‚Äôll continue its description.  The lens seriously sticks out over the main part of the body - almost the thickness of the entire recorder.  At the top right we see the IR illumination, on the left - the slots of the speaker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1b3/d7a/e20/1b3d7ae201df004dca0596447c0509d8.jpg"><br><br>  On the left side, as I understand it, the speaker ‚Äúcontinues‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cdb/fc8/31d/cdbfc831d1ca862ff3ccc174881285e6.jpg"><br><br>  On the right is the miniUSB connector (when is the microUSB waiting for something?), As well as the AV output and the memory card slot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c31/084/f25/c31084f254082bfea2df03987fcec813.jpg"><br><br>  At the bottom we observe the reset button and the HDMI output.  It is gratifying that there are both TV-out.  It is even more pleasant that not a single TV cable was put in the package - thereby not increasing the price of the model.  Personally, I have no desire to bring the picture directly to the TV.  Still, the registrar is a purely working tool whose performance does not pull on the status of a feature film for a large screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f0f/cb8/9ba/f0fcb89baefc14b5d15b5e28c52f820b.jpg"><br><br>  The button on top performs three functions.  To start, turn on / off the recorder.  If you are shooting a video, a short press takes an instant photo.  When viewing a captured video, pressing a key marks the file as excluded from participation in a loop recording.  In short, we get a protected file. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4c1/546/a95/4c1546a9580bc8e6fa2e4b4863e02bb8.jpg"><br><br>  All other control buttons are located to the right of the screen.  It's impossible to get confused, everything is clear and accessible.  The up / down keys are used to move around the menu, and at the same time can adjust the volume level.  The "M" key toggles the video / photo modes, as well as viewing the captured video / photographic material.  If you press the button during shooting, the file will be marked as protected.  The round key is either getting a photo, or an analogue of ‚ÄúOK‚Äù in the menu. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/abd/e93/16c/abde9316c5528e08ee92f282dd61926a.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Features of work and shooting</b> <br><br>  With the placement in the car, the question did not arise.  I installed the mount, stretched the wire around the rim of the window, put the charge in the cigarette lighter - and got a start on the recording engine.  In the sense - not by the sound of the engine (now an obsolete approach), but by the fact of supplying power to the electrical network.  How secretive a registrar is to make is personal.  But I would not advise too high to position the device - so that there are no problems with turning the camera to the side when communicating with the inspector. <br><br>  I will list the settings items - for those who are interested in the details.  In principle, the contents of the items are clear from the title, so I‚Äôll only discuss in detail in the first two cases.  For the rest, I will briefly say that all the basic points are in place: setting night shooting, changing the sensitivity of the G-sensor <br><br><ul><li>  resolution (1920x1080, 1440x1080, 1280x720 pixels; all at 30 fps) </li><li>  cyclic recording (the length of the rollers - 1,2, 5, 10, 15 minutes or a continuous stream) </li><li>  Motion Sensor </li><li>  power on record </li><li>  auto power off delay </li><li>  on delay </li><li>  sound recording </li><li>  tongue </li><li>  TV type </li><li>  date and time stamp </li><li>  time setting </li><li>  auto power off </li><li>  formatting </li><li>  auto power off display </li><li>  license plate installation </li><li>  reset </li><li>  lighting frequency </li><li>  G-sensor settings </li><li>  night mode settings </li><li>  night mode </li><li>  memory card selection </li><li>  firmware version. </li></ul><br>  For shooting is responsible 2 megapixel camera.  Those who seriously measure the quality of photo / video "smartphone" megapixels probably already made conclusions.  The rest remembered that 1920 x 1080 = 2,073,600 pixels and "everyone understands."  Unfortunately, the type of optics is not specified - apparently, it did not come to glass.  But the lens has a metal rim, so the model is not the most budget. <br><br>  The time has come for the main thing - shooting examples.  Attached recording day and night video.  I note that the files are saved in the MOV format, the bitrate is 7 Mbps.  In principle, the last parameter is nothing outstanding, standard for recorders.  Although I would prefer to see the installation at the level of 10-12 Mbps.  By the way, the built-in 500 mAh battery was enough for about 18 minutes of shooting. <br><br>  Sample Day Shot <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/6v4P_iX98X4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255&amp;usg=ALkJrhh9lXAuQevGmDGz7ZC5PIVUDJ8NDg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Sample Night Shot <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/U_s2q4IE-EE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255&amp;usg=ALkJrhjJ2bEDABUwt1aqh4fjhTDo6qdsfg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  An interesting point is that the recorder uses the Ambarella A2 processor - the one for which I recently criticized the teXet recorder.  After getting acquainted with the AdvoCam-FD2 Mini-GPS, I can still conclude that the installed optics mostly affect the video quality.  So, in AdvoCam-FD2 Mini-GPS, the image is devoid of obscure, faded colors.  Depending on the conditions, the readability of numbers on average is at a distance of about 10 meters, sometimes up to 15 meters.  I did not like the fact that sometimes ‚Äúfloating‚Äù pixels are visible - as if there are some problems with codecs. <br><br>  Night video is not bad.  It is clear that the distance of readability of numbers decreases - but in general the picture is ‚Äútransparent‚Äù and does not tend to ‚Äúfill up‚Äù the screen with ‚Äústars‚Äù of light sources or, on the contrary, by going to a black canvas. <br><br>  During the test runs in deep holes, and even more so the accident, I did not get - therefore I cannot fully appreciate the need to change the settings of the accelerometer.  Finally, I note that in addition to the accelerometer, the recorder has such a useful option as motion detection.  Shooting starts 3 seconds after detecting movement in the frame.  Given the size, the registrar is really not afraid to leave in the car - with a high probability prone to appropriation of another's property, citizens will not notice the device. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  The AdvoCam-FD2 Mini-GPS price tag is 5,790 rubles, the AdvoCam-FD2 Mini is 4,790 rubles.  Pros - convenient fastening, no problems in the stability of the work, small size.  In the end, a prudently attached memory card is included.  Among the shortcomings, I would say only that one should not expect an ideal recording quality from the model.  Still, glass optics, which is in the same AdvoCam-FD5 Profi, gives a better image.  If we consider the achievements of the novelty in comparison with similar at the price of "plastic" models, the price / capabilities of the device look adequate. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/186684/">https://habr.com/ru/post/186684/</a></p>
