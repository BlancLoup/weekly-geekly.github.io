  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The cult of Cargo in IT - troll adherents scrum</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For the third time in the last month, I meet with the troll of developers practicing all sorts of SCRUM / XP / AGILE and other scary words.  Generally - for good reason.  So, the meaning is as follows: <br><br>  During World War II, the United States built its military bases on all sorts of different wild islands in the Pacific.  Food and clothes were busy with airplanes, and part of the cargo was simply dropped down.  Well, and something fell to the wild people living on these islands.  And sometimes it fell so much that the aborigines scored completely on their economic activities, the cultivation of bananas and cattle breeding.  <b>The natives quickly realized that the Americans themselves did not produce nishtyaki, but they inherited everything from heaven, for loyalty to the spirits of their ancestors</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f3aa6ba3/3b986cea/836df5db/596c49be.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The war ended, the Americans turned the base.  And imagine their surprise when, 20 years later, returning to these islands, they found marching blacks with fake guns, headphones made of wood, replicas of bamboo planes in full size, dummies of straw airfields ... In general, the natives quite clearly emulated the actions of Americans , with the only difference that the spirits of the ancestors for some reason did not hurry to drop nishtyaki from the heavens anymore. <br><br>  Troll supporters of flexible technologies like this: <i>‚ÄúThe natives didn‚Äôt understand what was going on, <b>they didn‚Äôt understand how the world works</b> , and why food falls from the sky.</i>  <i>Therefore <b>, meaningless rituals were performed that did not work</b> .</i>  <i>And IT-shniki also perform meaningless rituals, for example, standing at the kanban board in the morning, or planning with the help of <a href="http://planningpoker.ru/">Planning Poker</a> cards, absolutely not understanding the meaning of what is happening.</i>  <i>Here are stupid :)! ‚Äù</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/88fd6ce3/b5e5af5d/9493779a/b0deffeb.jpg"><br>  <i>Spirits of ancestors see everything!</i> <br><br>  There is certainly a sound grain in such attacks.  Nevertheless - the position is rather one-sided, so here are my 5 kopecks about the cult of Cargo in IT. <br><br>  The only thing that the trolls can not clearly answer is how to stop being blacks worshiping planes.  And how to become those dudes who have their own planes.  In short, the question <b>"WHAT TO DO?"</b> .  The maximum that can be heard "Start thinking with your head." <br><br>  First of all, you should always think with your head, regardless of whether you practice SCRUM / XP / AGILE, write in PHP / Node.js / Java, or you generally have all the processes delivered through the ass. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a10bf10e/d9b06b59/e55e2ad6/4476c7af.jpg"><br>  <i>On this board we will now solve all our problems.</i> <br><br>  Secondly, it is not necessary to consider IT-shnik idiots.  In this industry, the concentration of sensible people is very high.  This includes those that can independently assess the extent to which any methodologies have been introduced on the quality of the work process. <br><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f2e2b582/c101c0b9/452371a1/55e8da0b.jpg"><br>  Thirdly, the advice to ‚Äúthink with your head‚Äù sounds like <a href="http://lurkmore.ru/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD"><b>‚Äúlearn math</b></a> . <a href="http://lurkmore.ru/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD"><b>‚Äù</b></a>  Sorry, but which section?  What specific actions should Negroes do so that they have their own planes?  You do not find that these actions will be a little more than fucking, and this is fucking long and difficult process? <br><br>  Fourth, wherever such methodologies are applied, they are applied adaptively.  That is, not teams adapt to ‚Äúrituals‚Äù, but ‚Äúrituals‚Äù adapt to commands.  There are endless experiments to improve the development process.  And the resulting feedback is analyzed.  For example, a team leader says: <br><br>  - And let's try scrum? <br>  - Let's! <br><br>  Tried, analyzed the result.  <b>Got better?</b>  <b>Yes - we continue to experiment and change processes further.</b>  <b>It became worse - we see why, we are looking for how to improve.</b> <br><br>  Perhaps the only problem with the natives is that they stopped in their search and experiments and did not receive any feedback. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129676/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129676/</a></p>
