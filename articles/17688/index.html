This is certainly not as expected by all theorists, but the <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D53827">unknown Web 3.0 is unknown to anyone</a> .  But, from my point of view, this is exactly what will have a very long and very positive effect on the development of the social web.  Again the <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D5821">practice was ahead of the theorists</a> .

      With this note I open a new cycle, in which I want to finally figure out myself and, maybe, show other specialists where the social Internet is going.  And how this all, from my point of view, will affect new web startups, web developers, marketers, and, of course, users.  I plan (as materials become available, the links will ‚Äúcome to life‚Äù): <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ submit a <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D65574">brief description of the concepts of</a> two new directions in the field of open social platforms: FaceBook and Open Social; <br>  ‚Ä¢ to trace the general evolution of the so-called engines and platforms of the social Internet; <br>  ‚Ä¢ give an <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/pure_content/33586.html">overview of</a> all the options for building social networks that exist today; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D85908">compare in</a> more detail the functionality of open social platforms, including in terms of a single information space; <br>  ‚Ä¢ discuss the impact of open social platforms on marketing and advertising and commercial activities on the Internet; <br>  ‚Ä¢ to illustrate <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/pure_content/33014.html">with examples</a> how it all works, and where additional money may lie here; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D85908">tell</a> what is common between the concepts of SaaS and open social platforms; <br>  ‚Ä¢ show how the <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D72401">essence of web startups is changing</a> in the new era of social Internet; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Refine, taking into account the platforms that have just emerged, our concept and business model of the <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D72401">new social Internet</a> project. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Well, I want to start with chronology. <br><br>  <strong>Season of social platforms</strong> <br><br>  It is these words that can be used to describe the events of the spring-autumn period of this year.  Brief chronicle of the main ones: <br><br>  <strong>May 24, 2007</strong>  Facebook (at the time 30 million users) announces the successful completion of the first beta test phase of a specialized open platform for building various applications to its resource.  The presented development turned out to be such a powerful move that now more and more analysts are inclined to recognize the open web platform Facebook as the hit of the outgoing year.  <strong>The revolution has begun.</strong> <br><br>  <strong>June 2, 2007</strong>  Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of FaceBook, announces additional steps in the development of his platform.  Among them is the ability of applications to work with their own registration system, i.e., outside the common login space of Facebook.  <strong>Waiting for competitors.</strong> <br><br>  <strong>October 19, 2007</strong>  On Web 2.0, Summit announced that MySpace (100 million users) followed in the footsteps of its main competitor and opens its platform for developers.  <strong>The revolution continues.</strong> <br>  <strong>November 1, 2007</strong>  Google presents its Open Social.  Unlike the FaceBook and MySpace platforms, the openness of this platform can be squared: it is open to developers and to social resources.  For example, LinkedIn, Ning, Orkit, Salesforce, Oracle, Friendster, and several other companies that put this platform at the heart of their open APIs took part in the beta testing of Open Social.  All these companies presented at the presentation the relevant applications to their social resources.  As the poet said, <strong>"revolution has its beginnings, revolution has no end</strong> . <strong>"</strong> <br><br>  <strong>December 3, 2007</strong>  LinkedIn (17 million users) announces the start of testing the extension of Open Social, focused only on their own resources.  A new specialized platform called Intelligent Applications (almost our intelligent social resource, right? :) Let's wait, however).  Friendster and Bebo are going to go the same way.  Once again, the well-known rule is confirmed: to <strong>make friends ‚Äúagainst‚Äù is easier than to make friends ‚Äúfor‚Äù.</strong> <br><br>  <strong>December 10, 2007</strong>  In the conditions of increased competition in the open social platform market, their ancestor of FaceBook (already about 50 million users) makes a forced promise to ‚Äúopen‚Äù its open platform ‚Äúclosed‚Äù for other social networks.  Taking into account their alliance with Microsoft, you can only make some assumptions about the directions of such a ‚Äúlittle openness‚Äù.  At this point, created about 100 thousand. A variety of Facebook applications.  Some of them are either already sold, or negotiations are underway.  <strong>The revolution was supported by the masses.</strong> <br><br>  <strong>Returning back (November 23rd, 2007).</strong>  A very local event is the presentation of the concept of the New Social Internet Resource Factory.  I received a lot of feedback on this project (mainly through personal correspondence).  At the same time, if the relevance of the first component of our concept, the intelligent business web, few have raised doubts, then you can‚Äôt tell about the second component - the platform for this web.  Some, in general, described it as "doubtful."  It so happened that the development of our concept proceeded in parallel with the creation of Open SoCial.  If I somehow tracked the situation with the Facebook platform, then what I‚Äôll see in the Open Social practice I hadn‚Äôt yet imagined.  And all the more I did not expect LinkedIn and Ning to join the new platform so quickly.  I may not seem quite modest, but now I‚Äôm ready to boldly state that if our concept were in the hands of Google or Microsoft, one would have expected the next stage of the platform revolution.  But, alas ... and therefore will have to adapt to the existing realities.  How?  About this in one of the following notes.  Well, for now ... the <strong>Runet micro revolution is being transferred</strong> :) <br>  By the way, how will the Runet respond to the platform revolution in general?  After all, functional clones are not enough.  The situation in some ways reminds me of the one that took <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D685">shape</a> in the 60s in the Soviet computing technology.  True, in our case, stealing is nothing - the platforms are open! <br><br>  <em>That turned out to be a busy open social platform season.</em>  <em>And we, in anticipation of further avalanche-like developments, will first deal with two, I think, landmark platforms: FaceBook and Open Social.</em>  <em>And this "disassembly" was carried out in the full version of this note (with all the necessary links), published in my iTech Bridge <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D65574">blog</a> .</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/17688/">https://habr.com/ru/post/17688/</a></p>
