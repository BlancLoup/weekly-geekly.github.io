  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The crisis of the genre: dumping on content exchanges</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Content exchanges turned into a circus and this is a fact.  Returning after, of course, a difficult school day, professional writers rush to take several dozen orders for the ruble to fifty per thousand characters.  At this point, I want to stop and thank the wise leadership of services for the creation of cheap labor, which daily litters the network with thousands of meaningless characters.  However, customers also do not particularly bother with tasks completed for a penny, accepting, of course, ‚Äúunique articles‚Äù (indeed, the check shows their high uniqueness) - they are little concerned with the meaning of the texts placed on advertising sites, because search engine robots will read them .  The main thing is to quickly fill the next site and that there is less "water". <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But among those who remain committed to ‚ÄúCtrl + C / Ctrl + V‚Äù are authors who are directly involved in intellectual work.  Enough of such people for a short time, after which they leave voluntary slavery, unable to cope with hard dumping.  In this they are helped by the exchanges themselves, who are interested in lowering prices and, consequently, greater turnover within the system.  And services that care about the quality of completed orders can generally be counted on the fingers.  Often, their strict rules do not imply an increased rate and only repel the performers of senseless fuss for the right to get access to expensive orders.  Understanding this, good writers are found there in even smaller numbers. <br><br>  You can watch this monotonous process of content circulation forever.  And at some point it starts to seem that the exchange is a roulette, in which, by and large, only the owner wins.  Of course, you can skillfully use them if you know what you want from a writer and know how to properly organize the work of those most desperate teachers and lecturers from neighboring countries and the depths of the country.  Without any questions, they will become your slaves and fill the site with quality content.  After that, be sure to go to rest, having burnt out at the thankless job.  Several conclusions follow from this: <br><br>  - ultimately, content exchanges, as a phenomenon of the last decade, will be forced to meet writers, <br>  - or squeeze out a profit from new customers, expecting restructuring into serious companies specializing in content.

      I have not visited the content exchange for a long time and was very surprised by the surrealism of what is happening to them today.  Top exchanges have become a real swamp, profit from customers.  The latter, I am sure, after a while run away from them to private companies offering the services of professional writers.  And rightly so!  Instead of taking care of good authors working on the image of the service, and stricter selection among candidates, the exchanges lower the rates and accept a system of strict fines, not taking into account the level of one or another author.  And here sits such a desperate teacher, is forced to write articles for some "startup", and then he drinks himself, falling asleep in the classroom before his customers (do not believe it? Search the video for the web!). <br><br>  I think it is now partly clear who forces the stock exchange to cut rates and creates difficult working conditions for really good authors.  The topic of earnings in the network today is relevant, by and large, for those who are not officially able to get a job for legislative reasons.  Yes, and they still could not work - the schedule in schools is merciless, Saturdays - and those are busy.  Most of the authors, of course, are schoolchildren.  They actively use free programs and send low-quality texts to customers, wasting time and nerves of the latter.  Under their blow there is another part, constantly reducing their number on the stock exchanges - these are workers in the sphere of education, as a rule, from the depths of the CIS countries.  I don‚Äôt know how now, but earlier it was possible to find such an author and get excellent work in a short time.  After ten articles, such an author disappeared.  It is understandable, a thankless task. <br><br>  Many people who think about making money on content markets want to know - is this a myth or a reality?  In order to dispel dreams of easy money and quiet work in home slippers, I will immediately say - no, it is impossible.  Especially now, when the rates have dropped to the ruble (I confess, after a few years, for me it was real news!).  Several years ago, I earned on content exchanges and as a private author (working for SEO companies and network media) an amount equal to the average income in St. Petersburg, but now I have a big doubt that exchanges can still help me with something professional authors.  So that you can understand, imagine that your wages have been recalculated and now it is only 15% of that which you used to receive.  You can work for free, by the way - for the rating that you will be charged for the slightest offense. <br><br>  And once I was brought to the content exchange for this very purpose - to check the possibility of earning money on the Web.  Alas, but there it was possible to earn only low-quality and often simply delusional content.  Even then, back in 2010, customers were willing to accept even incoherent texts, written only to make fun of readers.  For example, one article of four and a half thousand characters could have been written by me in five to ten minutes.  As a result, I came to the point that I began to set personal goals - to write incoherent texts beautifully and to reduce the time spent on writing such content (by the way, good training in developing print speed!). <br><br>  A total of about six years passed between my visit to the content exchanges.  During this time, the quality of the texts has changed significantly and not for the better, the possibilities for good authors have narrowed.  And, I am sure, a wild price cut will ever touch each of us - be it a customer or an author.  Personally, I feel this dumping today by opening the site of a reputable company and reading a description that does not correspond to the product.  And last week, I was a long time dealing with a photo of a product that was apparently thoughtlessly copied from the Web and had no relation to the name.  The same thing happens with information copied by hundreds of writers, reproducing the effect of a damaged phone.  So, dumping on content exchanges is a fact.  And to tour this circus, apparently, is going for a long time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299958/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299958/</a></p>
