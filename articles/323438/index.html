      The best software of this class has a corresponding administration console, built-in a variety of reports, means of sorting mail logs, date tracking and archiving.  Many such programs are compatible with all types of email, including mobile. <br><br>  Often, the most convenient option for the client is to combine email encryption with the business applications it uses.  In this case, you should first pay attention to the HPE SecureMail software. <br><br>  In addition, the <a href="http://www.toptenreviews.com/software/privacy/best-email-encryption-software/">ranking of</a> software for working with secure mail, conducted by TopTenReviews, put this package in first place in the top ten for 2017. He also received a number of awards at the end of 2016. <br><br>  ========================= <br>  <b>Ranking TopTenReviews</b> <br><br>  1. HPE SecureMail <br>  2. DataMotion <br>  3. Proofpoint <br>  4. EdgeWave <br>  5. Trend Micro <br>  6. Cryptzone <br>  7. Symantec <br>  8. Sophos <br>  9. LuxSci <br>  10. Privato <br>  11. Comodo <br>  ======================== <br><br>  <b>How to choose Email Encryption Software</b> <br><br>  Small businesses can directly trust their employees to decide which emails they send should be encrypted.  In this situation, almost any local desktop or cloud solution will work quite well. <br><br>  Larger companies usually do not include the end user in the process of deciding on the encryption of a letter, using pre-configured filters based on role-based policies. <br><br>  In this case, emails are encrypted after they leave the employee‚Äôs desktop, at the point through which they pass.  This can be a mail server, a gateway, a special hardware device, or a web portal. <br><br>  Sometimes the encryption method is chosen taking into account the rules and restrictions that impose corporate IT integration and compatibility requirements.  This applies, for example, to Outlook plug-ins, email sent from mobile devices, some mail protocols and archiving methods. <br><br>  The value and experience that is available to the recipient.  Therefore, enterprises are often looking for a secure email solution that provides user-friendly options for sharing secure mail. <br><br>  Modern email encryption software (Email Encryption Software, EES) is usually compared according to the following criteria. <br><br>  <b>1. Security level</b> .  All mail software somehow encrypts e-mails.  However, better email services offer a wider range of security options ‚Äî at least, end-user-initiated encryption, and corporate policy-based encryption. <br><br>  <b>2. Recipient experience</b> .  The best for the user is software that allows him to send and receive encrypted emails with his personal passwords, without the administrator participating in this process, who manages user requests. <br><br>  <b>3. Controls</b> .  Competitive EES should have advanced, yet user-friendly administration tools.  Better software also provides simple or even automatic deployment options and pre-configured policies that comply with common legal restrictions. <br><br>  <b>4. Integration and compatibility</b> .  To be really useful and effective, mail encryption software must work in conjunction with popular business software, such as Salesforce, GroupWise, etc. The best are EES compatible with most popular platforms and business applications used.  Consider in terms of the specified selection criteria for HPE SecureMail. <br><br>  <b>HPE SecureMail</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/180/315/65e/18031565ec8f48019a96ddc676d579d6.png"><br>  <i>HPE SecureMail Deployment Options</i> <br><br>  HPE SecureMail (HPESM) provides risk management by protecting communications, proprietary data and user information.  The package provides complete protection that is compatible with corporate business systems. <br><br>  HPESM does not often require complex key management in such cases, however, providing a sufficiently high level of security that also meets the current requirements for financial and medical information systems. <br><br>  HPESM is trusted by large financial institutions, but this secure e-mail can be recommended for individual use as appropriate.  It is available as a cloud solution, as an on-premise option (deployable on the customer‚Äôs site), or as a hybrid model. <br><br>  The cloud version is a fully functional SaaS service.  The on-premise solution comes in the form of an ISO image that includes CentOS (version of Red Hat Linux).  The system can be independently installed by administrators on virtually any hardware used today, at their choice. <br><br>  <b>Security level</b> <br><br>  HPESM uses Identity-Based Encryption (IBE, public key cryptography) type encryption.  Since the security policy is encoded directly in encryption and authentication methods, there is no need to manage traditional security certificates.  This significantly reduces the resources normally required for key management.  The HPESM Gateway also supports common TLS, S / MIME and PGP protocols. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d8d/c47/ac0/d8dc47ac01d2445396d5257790243cc7.png"><br>  <i>How it works.</i>  <i>The diagram shows how encryption technology protects information ‚Äî corporate and user.</i> <br><br>  The package is recommended for financial communications, where an increased level of security is required.  It provides HP SecureData Payments service for continuous payment transaction protection and browser protection through HP SecureData Web. <br><br>  All solutions are scalable, and in this regard there are no limitations.  The administrator does not need to form policies separately.  However, HPESM can also manage policies, and assign unique permissions to different users and groups. <br><br>  <b>Recipient Experience</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d4/9fc/a3c/6d49fca3c84346ae9ea06dd29d371256.png"><br>  <i>End-user response to the received encrypted message</i> <br><br>  Successful collaborative secure communications are directly dependent on the experience of end users.  HPESM mail does not require in-depth study and can be opened by the client directly in Outlook using the appropriate plug-in. <br><br>  <b>Controls</b> <br><br>  For the most part, HPESM deployment does not require the setting of specific individual parameters and can be performed over the network.  After HPESM is deployed, the administrator only needs to manage policies and groups, monitor events and manage archiving. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce3/16c/56f/ce316c56f8f648fa9e3f66e720ed12ee.png"><br>  <i>The administrator allows certain users access to encrypted files simply by selecting them from the list.</i> <br><br>  HPESM is fully compatible with Windows Active Directory and Exchange.  Users after downloading to Windows can also be automatically downloaded to HPESM.  The package has a large number of options for customizing reports, including a set of pre-configured reports.  The same goes for sorting and searching.  These include reports by date, domain, user, sender, reader, user, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca8/fa3/690/ca8fa36909654bef8bd5fe38b34852dd.png"><br>  <i>From this menu, you can encrypt files and send them by e-mail.</i>  <i>You can also configure access for certain users to them.</i> <br><br>  Directly from the management console, the administrator can easily create new policies ‚Äî encryption for new clients, mobile policies, authentication requirements, etc. From the same unified console, the administrator also sets backup and archive schedules. <br><br>  <b>Integration and Compatibility</b> <br><br>  HPESM has numerous embedded real-world usage scenarios based on market demand studies.  The product works with all mail servers, Microsoft Office 365, ERP, CRM and many other systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/815/39c/905/81539c9057644f1db3796805f0f8a656.png"><br>  <i>Encryption of important office documents, such as Excel spreadsheets, integrates directly into the application.</i> <br><br>  HPESM is compatible with identity and access management systems (IAMS), mobile device management systems (Mobile Device Management, MDM), as well as Blackberry Enterprise Server, Microsoft Exchange, Symantec Enterprise Vault, Thales and Security Modules ( HSMs), Operator Card Set (OCS), etc. <br><br>  HPESM has an API for merging with almost all widely used enterprise systems.  This makes it one of the most compatible solutions of the EES class.  Additional features include the secure transfer of large files, digital signatures, file encryption (transmitted as applications), eDiscovery and archiving.  Encryption works with files of any type, and they remain secure, regardless of where they are stored. <br><br>  <b>HPE SecureMail in Enterprise</b> <br><br>  <b>Pros</b> - HPE SecureMail provides natural mail communications, a wide range of hardware compatibility, and integration with most business applications.  HPESM supports user and corporate-based encryption, and also includes rich reporting capabilities. <br><br>  <b>Cons</b> - If your enterprise uses Lotus Notes, you should work with Lotus email security tools.  HPESM is also not compatible with Android Honeycomb. <br><br>  <b>Verdict</b> - HPE SecureMail provides secure e-mail options suitable for almost all structures, be it a separate small or medium-sized company or a large transnational financial institution. <br><br>  HPESM easily integrates with your existing IT infrastructure and provides a convenient end-user experience with encrypted email.  The product requires few resources and meets the requirements of eDiscovery. <br><br>  The solution offers more direct and tight integration than most similar systems, and APIs for various business applications.  You should contact him if you need a secure email solution that easily integrates into the current IT infrastructure of the enterprise. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/323438/">https://habr.com/ru/post/323438/</a></p>
