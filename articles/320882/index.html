So it‚Äôs in business.  Every action of the company - from hiring employees to purchasing software - is associated with money, namely, expenses and income.  So, the question must be approached carefully and make an informed decision.  You go on the Internet to read what people say, and there is a lot of mixed information, which in fact is not always reliable.  As a result, stereotypes are formed.  The same thing happens with CRMs. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/56b/427/d64/56b427d64649375d660eb5eacc3dafe8.jpg"></div>  <i><font color="#999999">Source: Yandeks.Kartinki</font></i> <br><br>  CRM-systems settled down in Russia and demanded by business.  However, it is difficult to imagine software, around which there would be as many misconceptions that will alarm the future user.  We, as a vendor, often have to deal with each of them individually and several at once.  We have selected the 15 most common stereotypes about CRM systems.  Let's look at them in detail. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Top managers should not be involved in the implementation, it is enough to install software and show where to look at the final tables.</font> </h3><br>  There are cases when top management gets involved in working with CRM after it has been installed and run-in, but this is a disastrous practice.  First of all, the management of the company determines the strategic goals and plans to achieve which operational activities are being conducted - and in the process of implementing CRM these plans must be taken into account.  For example, the head of the company decided that it was necessary to change the process of coordination of documents and logistics.  In view of the poor flow of information, only two top managers knew about it.  At this time, CRM is being implemented in parallel for the sales department, warehouse and logistics, taking into account the requirements within the old strategy.  When you first meet the boss with the program, you will have to refine it.  The worst option is when a manager simply washes his hands and does not purposefully participate in the business automation process.  In this case, you should bring to it the important advantages of the software and insist on its participation.

    <ul><li>  CRM provides information business strategy: provides actual data on sales, marketing, warehouse, etc .; <br><br></li><li>  CRM-system helps to improve the results and impacts on customer loyalty based on the analysis; <br><br></li><li>  In general, the CRM-system makes it possible to reduce the costs of some areas, for example, sales and warehouse management, by automating routine tasks, transparency of the manager‚Äôs actions and process controllability. <br></li></ul><br>  If the manager is concerned about his business, then the CRM system should also be concerned as the main automation tool for this business.  Some popular foreign and domestic systems have outgrown the ‚Äúcustomer management and sales program‚Äù stage: now CRM is a complex automation, affecting most of the processes in the company.  Accordingly, the manager must not only show interest in the program or work in it - he must become the evangelist of the system in order to transmit its usefulness to his subordinates. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">We implement CRM only if it suits 100% of users in the company.</font> </h3><br>  In fact, the requirements of various departments are quite homogeneous, if you look at them from the point of view of a CRM system: reports, filters, funnels, etc.  Each user can customize the system by assigning custom values ‚Äã‚Äãof stages, statuses, saving filters, etc. in the directory.  Therefore, most often disparate requirements are simply reduced to the initial configuration. <br><br><hr>  Five lines of advertising.  We are a Russian company that makes <a href="http://regionsoft.ru/"><b>RegionSoft CRM</b></a> and a bunch of corporate software for businesses of any scale.  <a href="http://regionsoft.ru/">Regionsoft CRM</a> is a powerful desktop system that has several versions with a different set of functions.  Telephony, KPI, business processes, mailings, reports, transactions and everything else - in stock. <br>  Write, call, all our consultations and presentations are free.  You do not even have to move away from your PC. <hr><br>  If the specifics of the business involves customization for each unit, then it is better to focus on those points that clearly require automation.  As a rule, these are multi-level complex processes (orders, purchases, long sales, production tasks), routine repetitive tasks (coordination of documents, work with requests, standard sales, purchase of goods for the needs of the office), work with a warehouse, setting and controlling tasks, KPI .  And some processes cannot be automated at all.  These are strategies for communicating with VIP clients (not scripted), processes for creating marketing activities, one-time events, etc.  All of them get into CRM in one form or another, accumulate data, but are not automatic processes.  Therefore, if the personnel service receives a request to refine CRM in terms of calculating KPI, this is one thing, and if they ask to automate the interview with applicants, another thing is necessary to weigh the ratio of the price of refinement to its utility and frequency of use in the future. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Let's put the free version, and we will do the rest in Excel and on paper.</font>  <font color="#cc0000">We and the demo version is enough, in the end.</font>  <font color="#cc0000">And simply in Excel, in principle, it will do</font> </h3><br>  If you have more than one client in your company and you do not plan to stop there, you need to use CRM.  Because sooner or later you will encounter problems: <br><br><ul><li>  scaling - as the business grows and customer base accumulates, it will be necessary to store data, unify it and process it; <br><br></li><li>  security - contacts and transactions are your expensive asset, and it should be protected first of all from departing and unscrupulous employees; <br><br></li><li>  preservation - the data must be in your intact form; <br><br></li><li>  succession - in the case of the transfer of authority from the manager to the manager or the addition of new employees to the team, clients and tasks should be transferred quickly and in full. <br></li></ul><br>  Consider the listed options in the form of a table and evaluate their advantages and disadvantages: <br><br><table><tbody><tr><th width="160">  <b>Sign of</b> </th><th>  MS Excel </th><th>  Free CRM </th><th>  CRM demo </th><th>  The combination of Excel and free CRM </th></tr><tr><td>  <b>Scaling</b> </td><td>  Filling data is possible, if necessary, add new parameters - complexity. </td><td>  Filling data is possible up to a certain amount.  Functions, usually trimmed or deprecated. </td><td>  Filling data is possible up to a certain amount. </td><td>  Scaling causes confusion and data loss. </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Security</b> </td><td>  There are certain levels of sheet and book protection, but they are easily bypassed.  An inexperienced employee may incorrectly sort and re-save, it is not always possible to recover old versions. <br></td><td colspan="2">  In the demo version - no guarantees of data protection and security from the vendor - everything depends on you. <br>  In the free version - basic data protection. <br>  As a rule, do not set permissions. <br></td><td>  The data is scattered and protected at the level of the application in which they are located. </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Preservation</b> </td><td>  Data is easy to copy, in the general file on the server everyone sees all customers, there may be conflicts and conflicts. <br></td><td colspan="2">  Data integrity at the level of the flagship CRM system: if in the cloud - everything is in the cloud, if on the server - on the server.  However, it is not possible to grant access rights and share security policies. <br></td><td>  Initially, the data are in two places - this is the main threat to preservation. </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Continuity</b> </td><td>  It is possible to transfer (or not to transfer) a file in which the devil himself will break his leg.  You can allow a newbie to the file on the server - but you risk data integrity. <br></td><td colspan="2">  Send the username / password from cloud CRM or put an employee behind the outgoing PC - as a rule, single-user CRM. <br>  But there are exceptions, but their functionality is more than modest. <br></td><td>  See option 1 + option 2 </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Convenience of work</b> <br></td><td>  The familiar interface, with large amounts of information and the need for processing - problems and errors. <br></td><td>  As a rule, the truncated or outdated version is inferior to the flagship CRM. <br></td><td>  Just as in the flagship CRM, however, there are restrictions on individual functions or the number of entries. <br></td><td>  No convenience - data loss and switching between windows in search of the necessary information. </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Data unification</b> </td><td>  In general use, the data formats are confused; if you write conditional formatting, the formulas break down, because there are still few advanced Excel users. <br></td><td colspan="2">  Unification of data at the level of the "main" CRM-system, all data are entered with an input mask, drop-down list or prompts. <br></td><td>  There is no unification - complete isolation and confusion. </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Data exchange between departments</b> </td><td>  Send the file by e-mail, share it on the local network, use Excel Online. <br></td><td colspan="2">  There is no networking capability or it is limited. <br><br></td><td>  By email. </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Data control</b> </td><td>  Poor control <br></td><td colspan="2">  If there is no network work - there is no control, all managers work in their versions.  If there is - it is possible to control the data. <br></td><td>  There is no possibility to control anything, the data is both there and there. </td></tr></tbody></table>  There are two ways of development - extensive (when you increase sales, for example, by increasing the sales staff or the number of cold calls, that is, you are developing at the expense of quantity) and intensive (when you use modern technologies, new algorithms and focus on expanding the customer base and increasing loyalty, that is, improving the quality of its customers).  Without a CRM system, an intensive development path is practically impossible.  It is necessary to stop keeping contacts and data in the table with infinitely growing columns, choose a CRM-ku and you will never look back. <br><br>  <i>Here is a simple practical example.</i>  <i>There is a company that offers brigade services and sells building materials.</i>  <i>There were three salespeople and sales of 150,000 per month.</i>  <i>We hired two more, it was 250,000. Managers recorded clients in files - that is, they simply kept records of sales.</i>  <i>They gave advertising while it was spinning, customers arrived for another 70,000, after disconnecting advertising sales returned to 250,000. As you can see, the growth is extensive (a flat schedule).</i>  <i>They put a CRM system, added data and began to make additional sales to those who had already applied, entered household chemicals and curtains into the range, initiated mailing by SMS and e-mail.</i>  <i>After three months, sales steadily surpassed 550,000 and growth continued from this new point.</i>  <i>Growth is intense.</i> <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">We will not train salespeople, why should they be distracted from work?</font> </h3><br>  If the implementation of a CRM system is not accompanied by comprehensive internal training, consider that the project has failed.  Training must be, and in several stages: primary from the vendor and secondary, continuous within the company.  If you train once, the inspired employees will return to their work computers with a new CRM, will use it for a few days ... and forget.  One of the right decisions is to demand all reports on work, hold meetings, prepare business proposals based on data from CRM.  Someone gamifies the use of a CRM system, this is not the best option, since gamification will penetrate into all areas of the company's business, this is not serious - people go to work and it should be just work.  Gamification is justified only on the corporate portal in establishing relationships or in forming a corporate culture. <br><br>  Salespeople - a separate story.  CRM is their main working tool in which they keep contacts, conduct transactions, write out documentation, prepare contracts, call, count sales, build funnels, write reminders, and send mailings.  In general, all that is possible.  Accordingly, training is necessary, and the time spent on it will more than pay off with the start of work in the program. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">CRM works and makes profit from day one: set and forget</font> </h3><br>  No, CRM itself does not make a profit, does not call, and no matter how our competitors convince users, it does nothing unnoticed - all actions of a CRM system are initiated by a person (who from a technical point of view is an operator in relation to it).  Accordingly, a CRM system brings results when an employee aimed at this result works for it.  Indeed, as you could see by the example above, CRM promotes growth in sales and profits, but it‚Äôs still for now (and I‚Äôm sure it will be for a long time) indirectly.  Due to what?  (On the example of <a href="http://regionsoft.ru/">RegionSoft CRM</a> , solutions on the market are very different). <br><br><ul><li>  By streamlining the process of communication with customers.  You do not need to look for contacts and transactions, everything is tied to a single entity - a client card in which all documents are attached, accounts and transactions are kept, contacts are indicated, correspondence is saved and in general all the smallest details, including security of relations with the client and his questionnaire. <br><br></li><li>  Due to the formalization and automation of business processes.  All routine actions are described by diagrams that start at the moment of starting the procedure and automatically notify those in charge and take into account intermediate results. <br><br></li><li>  Due to increased customer loyalty and personalization.  Even minimal client ‚Äúrecognition‚Äù by the manager and call routing have a positive effect, not to mention the pre-sales, re-sales and discount programs. <br><br></li><li>  Due to the transparency of management processes.  Each manager controls his tasks and tracks the progress of his KPI. <br><br></li><li>  Due to the transparency of relations between employees.  Access rights in CRM, personal workspace and private clients leave no chance for managers to take clients away from each other, conflicts are exhausted as quickly as possible. <br></li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/df1/e0c/981/df1e0c9811bd4b704937fcd5d06295d9.jpg" width="500"></div>  <i><font color="#999999">Again, this robot became an employee of the month!</font></i> <br><br>  All employees should be interested in working with the CRM system, this is their time, their quiet activity in the company and honest relationships with the employer.  Then the effect of the introduction of the program will be noticeable. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Determine the profitability of CRM is impossible</font> </h3><br>  When you choose a CRM system, the first mistake is to choose it for the price: a lot of money, take the most expensive and heaped up.  Expensive software is not necessarily good software.  CRM-system must be selected based on the requirements and compliance of the program to them.  As with any investment, the new system must be cost-effective - that is, bring a measurable and measurable result. <br>  Return on investment in the implementation of CRM can be measured using a set of indicators that reflect the effectiveness of the acquired software. <br><br><ul><li>  Rate the dynamics of sales.  If you see a quantitative growth in sales and growth in monetary terms - this is the main indicator of the effectiveness of using a CRM system.  Make sure that the trend does not abruptly fall and fail.  If this happens, look for reasons. <br><br></li><li>  Estimate the duration of the sales cycle.  One of the key tasks of a CRM system is to reduce the sales cycle by automating processes and communication with the customer.  If this does not happen, conduct additional training for managers, show successful examples. <br><br></li><li>  Count the number of processed calls and leads.  The new system should contribute to the speed of processing requests.  If the figures do not satisfy you, try to give recommendations on the duration of the conversation with customers and set up a plan for calls. <br><br></li><li>  Evaluate changes in customer base - there should be more potential customers in the company.  The CRM system helps to keep and not lose contacts, which means that there should be more records about leads and potential customers than in the period without CRM. <br></li></ul><br>  In the end, within a few months you will feel the effect of the introduction of the dynamics of financial indicators.  If the indicators have deteriorated or have not changed, look for the causes inside the team (sabotage of the new software), study the system interaction profile and take action. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">CRM is just a program.</font>  <font color="#cc0000">Like MS Office or Photoshop</font> </h3><br>  Not really.  From a technical point of view, yes, CRM is an application software, a set of algorithms described in a programming language, exactly like all the others.  Differences occur at the level of user interaction.  In the case of Office or Photoshop, the interaction takes place according to a simple scheme: you want something from the program, enter information into it via the interface, get the result, close the program.  The manager interacts with the CRM system continuously, it uses it as: <br><br><ul><li>  data warehouse - contributes, accumulates and stores information; <br><br></li><li>  operational tool - all calls go through CRM, contracts and primary documentation are formed in it, work with mailings, etc., is going on; <br><br></li><li>  analytics tool - interprets data, builds reports, allows you to manage sales funnel, do ABC analysis, regulate assortment policy; <br><br></li><li>  self-monitoring tool - the manager sees his targets, monitors their progress; <br><br></li><li>  task management system - all tasks are set and controlled within schedulers and calendars with reminders, within CRM you can manage projects; <br><br></li><li>  A key element of the CRM strategy is customer relationship management, understanding the customer‚Äôs profile, portrait and needs. <br></li></ul><br>  Thus, a CRM system is an integrated multifunctional software with which the user continuously interacts within the workflow, that is, in fact, receives an electronic assistant. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/44b/b05/f2d/44bb05f2d666b9499338e1884cb124a8.png"></div>  <i><font color="#999999">Well, actually, that's why we need a computer.</font></i> <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">CRM is very difficult for understanding, I will bring only contacts</font> </h3><br>  With this approach, the CRM-system is better not to implement, it just does not pay off.  It‚Äôs common for a person to be afraid of everything new, especially if he is suspected of this new control by management (which, in fact, isn‚Äôt - through CRM you cannot spy on an employee, his actions on a PC, etc.).  In fact, it is easy to master CRM and start working in it, since its structure and functionality repeat the work of a manager.  Automation frees up work time, human resources and saves the company from the vicissitudes of paperwork and the war for customers between managers. <br>  If the resistance of employees is overcome with difficulty, it should be explained that the CRM system does not have any ability to monitor something other than the dynamics of work performance and time, to motivate employees, but preferably intangible, so that they do not turn the use of CRM into blackmail.  For example, it is possible to direct part of the freed time to staff development. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Cheers, CRM!</font>  <font color="#cc0000">Now you can dismiss a couple of salespeople and a secretary.</font>  <font color="#cc0000">Algorithm smarter than people</font> </h3><br>  Despite the fact that this idea is fundamentally wrong and totally unethical, some vendors continue to use it as an argument in the process of promoting their systems.  We have already discussed above that CRM without a user is just a shortcut on a PC desktop.  But the growth of labor productivity should not lead to reductions if your company is adequate and does not intend to curtail activities.  Consider that with the advent of CRM, your staff, with the same wage, increased one and a half times due to an increase in efficiency.  And you do not need to spend money on recruitment, adaptation and training.  Your employees are well aware of the company's processes, understand its specifics and the market in which it is necessary to work.  Such reinforcement is a reason to master new niches, sales channels, develop new ways of promotion, finally attend to service and customer support.  In general, use the free resource for the benefit of the company and to the fullest. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ce/55d/217/6ce55d2172f17465f1d0c7f5523e5ca6.jpg" width="500"></div>  <i><font color="#999999">Oh ... have you not heard?</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">The industrial revolution is over ... We won ...</font></i> <br><br>  CRM-system is a valuable tool for customer service, sales, advertising and marketing, top management, logistics, etc., but the main thing is people who extract and analyze data, communicate with customers, develop creative concepts, create and sell product.  CRM displays market conditions, provides data for understanding successes and failures, reflects trends, shortens the sales cycle, but responds to these indicators and only the user takes action.  Accordingly, the tool requires human intervention to obtain results and the company to a new level of development.  If you reduce the staff in proportion to the effect of CRM, then purely mathematically, and in fact you will mark time, and not grow.  The money saved on salaries is a drop in the sea next to the income you can get by saving people and entrusting them with new tasks.  In general, do not let yourself be deceived: dismissal after the introduction of CRM is just short-sighted and stupid manager. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">CRM can be implemented without prior analysis of cases in the company - the main thing is to automate sales and marketing.</font> </h3><br>  A very common misconception.  CRM-system is better to implement after you create requirements within the working group and determine which processes need to be automated.  The CRM system does not work for you, its purpose is to collect, process and store data, as well as automate routine and repetitive actions.  It is thanks to this state of information in your company that you can work quickly, without a hitch in memory of transactions and contacts with customers - this is the first brick in relations with them. <br>  Some CRM-systems (RegionSoft CRM including) automate business processes: in fact, you enter into the system an algorithm that indicates how action takes place after an action within a process and you get a scheme according to which the usual task is ‚Äúrun‚Äù without errors and delays. <br><br>  <i>For example, before the purchase of a batch of consumables in a printing house looked like this: on the production in the middle of an urgent order, the Orakal film ended, the production workers wrote to the manager, the manager urgently brought the necessary volume through his channels, then asked the purchaser to order the lot, the purchaser made a request, the general forgot to sign, after three the days of the search for the order were printed out a new one, the manager signed, the accounting department lost the invoice, requested again, the storekeeper lost five rolls of film, found it, transferred it to production - uffff!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>With CRM, it looks like this: there is a process ‚ÄúPurchase of consumables by Oracal film‚Äù, it contains the stages and responsible ones.</i>  <i>When the film runs out of stock, the storekeeper forms an order, sends it to CRM for approval, the order goes to the purchaser there, the accounting department receives a notification asking to pay the bill, the purchaser receives a reminder that the shipment is the day after, the storekeeper receives the batch, scans the bar codes in CRM, and the manager and production see that there is enough film.</i>  <i>No fuss or panic.</i>  <i>And all in electronic form without papers, in the framework of one process.</i> <br><br>  As you can see from the example, the majority of departments are involved in business processes, which means that it will not be possible to automate sales only and marketing.  It is necessary to understand the processes, examine them, find problem points (delays, irresponsibility, etc.) and automate the business together with the correction of problems.  For some reason, it seems to many companies that the survey of processes and interactions is something very complicated, they hire consultants and voluntarily pay money for their inability to gather, discuss and agree.  As a rule, a working group within a company and the support of an actively participating manager are enough to work out the requirements, jot down the main points of the terms of reference and contact the vendor. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">No data exchange - each department has restricted information with limited access, let sales and marketing fight on</font> </h3><br>  It should be said separately about the interaction of departments when using CRM.  Centralizing data for all commercial departments saves a lot of money and time required for entering data and analyzing it, facilitates company management and allows you to get full-fledged customer stories that may underlie promising developments.  And the trick here is that the units are interconnected and each of them pursues the same goal: to increase the profitability of the business, and according to the results of the excellent work to increase their well-being.  Everything is linear. <br><br>  But no.  There are situations when sales and promotions do not just conflict, but fight for high stakes, building intrigues and closing data.  As a result, everyone works as in a black box.  The service department and the entire front office in such situations are generally extreme, as they suffer from a lack of information. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/37d/aa9/510/37daa9510359d652b93738be3909a3bd.gif" width="500"></div>  <i><font color="#999999">Friends, to start selling normally, you should at least start talking to each other.</font></i> <br><br>  The real story about this problem, however, is not about our CRM, but about the well-known import, but in Russia.  In a company with 2 million customers bought and implemented CRM for commercial services.  The marketing department demanded that only they worked in the system.  The old sales department, consisting of a logistician and a manager, was not against it.  The new expanded sales force protested.  While there were disputes and approvals, the referral service was not informed about the current action, customer complaints fell down.  CRM was open to all businesses, but marketing closed access to its data and all analytics.  After a year of dragging the blanket, the CRM was out of work, because it turned out to be ineffective (still, when no one was fully working in it).  A project worth more than 20 million rubles was useless to no one. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee8/608/618/ee8608618025c2c4a064005e57d625a9.jpg" width="500"></div>  <i><font color="#999999">Get down!</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Marketing and sales are fighting!</font></i> <br><br>  Inside the organization, all data should be used in a complex, analytical information should be available to everyone who makes decisions based on it.  End-to-end automation is much better and more productive than patchwork. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Let the CRM be used by the head of sales department, buy him a single license, so be it</font> </h3><br>  In principle, there is nothing criminal in this situation, and theoretically it is possible to collect all the data from one person.  But then the whole point of CRM is lost as a tool for team work on customer relationship management and there will still be a loss of information.  In addition, in this situation, the head will spend all the time on entering data received from employees. <br><br>  The logic of the CRM system is as follows: employees enter customer information each in their own place, it is aggregated and stored in a single database, accesses are divided according to security policies, and the manager can analyze information and make decisions based on the results.  Automating each workplace has a positive effect, but not one at all. <br>  The only situation in which the purchase of a single license is possible is to work alone: ‚Äã‚Äãa beginner IP entrepreneur or a freelancer. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">CRM without integration with social networks?</font>  <font color="#cc0000">No, no, only with VKontakte, otherwise our metallurgists will collect orders</font> </h3><br>  In 2015-2016, releases of CRM vendors related to integration with social networks flooded Runet.  Overseas social CRM has become popular much earlier because users actively communicate with brands in public, ask questions, write reviews, comment.  A CRM system for such purposes should not only hook up messages from the group's accounts via the API, but also save user profiles, accumulate their interests, etc.  Thus, the company receives not abstract registrations, but warm leads.  In Russia, most of the CRM integrated with social networks do not all tasks. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e44/f05/5a8/e44f055a829edcc30f2bf36f01b305d2.jpg" width="500"></div>  <i><font color="#999999">- Well, what a great idea for this new campaign?</font></i> <i><font color="#999999"><br></font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">- We will become digital (digital).</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Facebook</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Youtube.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Mobile app.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Interesting.</font></i> <i><font color="#999999"><br></font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">‚ÄúAnd what are we going to do in all these channels?‚Äù</font></i> <i><font color="#999999"><br></font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">‚ÄúI don't know, we'll figure it out later.‚Äù</font></i> <br><br>  Not every business needs to work with social networks.
