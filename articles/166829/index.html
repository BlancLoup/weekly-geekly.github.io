      Basic Theses ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>11. Developers pile around iOS and Android, but continue to look at alternatives.</b> <br><br>  Android continues to lead in the interests of developers from 72% (an increase of 4% compared with 2012), while interest in iOS fell by 5%.  Many developers are planning to tackle Windows Phone (47%) and BB10 (15%), which shows the unabated developer interest in a third viable mobile ecosystem. <br><br>  <b>10. HTML5 needs native APIs and a better development environment.</b> <br><br>  HTML5 remains a good alternative to native development in such categories as Business and Products (HTML is used by 42% of developers), Enterprise applications (32%) and Media (28%).  For further development, HTML5 needs better access to native APIs, a better development environment and better debugging systems. <br><br>  <b>9. iOS, Android and BlackBerry leading platforms</b> <br><br>  iOS has become the top priority platform - for 48% of people involved in developing for iOS, it is the main compared to others.  iOS, Android and BlackBerry - these three platforms are most often used by developers as the main ones.  Windows Phone and HTML serve only as an addition to them and are used by developers to expand in those segments and regions that are not covered by the main platforms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4c1/1ee/e2a/4c11eee2a4f32e350f629ad214f2d263.png"><br><br>  <b>8. Tablets received the same attention of developers as smartphones, and TV remains a niche product.</b> <br><br>  The majority (86%) of the developers surveyed target smartphones, but most of them also develop for tablets.  IOS developers are leading here, 76% of which point to the iPad as an attractive platform in terms of development and monetization.  Development for TV continues to remain in the shadows (6% of Android developers), as the hype around the Smart TV is just starting to unfold. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e83/28d/20d/e8328d20d452ebfbb9edf97837857476.png"><br><br>  <b>7. 72% of developers use 2+ platforms, but money is concentrated in iOS / Android</b> <br><br>  The choice of platforms is reduced.  On average, a developer uses 2.6 mobile platforms against 2.7 in a 2012 study and 3.2 in 2011. 80% of developers use Android, iOS, or both, which makes them the basis for any development.  Developers who do not use these platforms earn, on average, half of those who use them, which leaves no doubt about the concentration of all the forces around these two most important ecosystems. <br><br>  <b>6. Advertising is now the most popular means of monetization.</b> <br><br>  Advertising is used by 38% of developers.  At the same time, this model gives the least profit per application.  Shopping inside applications and Freemium on take-off with a 50% increase compared to 2012, now almost a quarter of applications create them.  IAP is now the second most popular earnings model on iOS, in-app purchases are now used by 37% of developers. <br><br>  <b>5. Google AdMob is used by 65% ‚Äã‚Äãof developers using advertising services.</b> <br><br>  AdMob has recently opened an ad exchange, which has given it strength to fight other ad networks.  Inneractive is the second and third largest service that deals with the exchange of advertisements and intermediary services, and InMobi, an Indian advertising network that has become an important player in emerging markets - both have 12% of developers.  Apple iAd is in fourth place with 11%, although AdMob still leads on iOS with 66% of developers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d8e/0b7/c7e/d8e0b7c7e0a73c5bd5769320dd1407fe.png"><br><br>  <b>4. PhoneGap and Appcelerator - Leading Tools</b> <br><br>  PhoneGap uses 34% of developers, Appcelerator and Adobe Air 21% and 19%, respectively.  There are more than 100 cross-platform development tools on the market and the choice for developers can be quite complex.  The most important functions for developers are access to native API platforms, optimizing performance and the ability to play native interface elements for each platform. <br><br>  <b>3. Google (69%) and Flurry (49%) ahead of all analytical services</b> <br><br>  Analytical services become extremely important in the question of optimizing applications for greater involvement and retention of users and serve as a proxy for user feedback.  User analytics services are more important for iOS developers - they are used by 39% of iOS developers versus 28% for Android, 25% for WP and 15% for BB.  Using analytics serves as an indicator of competence among developers across multiple platforms. <br><br>  <b>2. The universe of developer tools is expanding and consolidating.</b> <br><br>  The Business to Developer (B2D) market has been constantly expanding over the past 3 years with a roll of B2D startups trying to meet the ever increasing needs of developers.  For every 1000 start-up applications, there is 1 startup tool for developers.  In parallel, such consolidation occurs through organic growth (as is the case, for example, with Flurry and Papaya) and mergers / acquisitions (for example, Appcelerator acquired Aptana, Cocoafish, Particle Code). <br><br>  <b>1. More than 500 tools for developers and entrepreneurs.</b> <br><br>  Over the past 3 years, developers have evolved from coders to innovators, designers and creators ‚Äî and to a big prize for hundreds of firms operating in the B2D economy.  The needs of the developers have not changed much over the years - the number of startups has changed, from Appcelerator to Zong, which are trying to satisfy these needs.  Now for developers there are more than 500 third-party tools (API, SDK, components) that feed each step of their work.  Developer tools, from ad networks to user analytics, are the backbone of the economics of the Android and iOS platforms, and their main differentiator. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.visionmobile.com/DE13Apps4all">Download Developer Economics 2013 can be on the link.</a>  We have already begun work on the Russian version. <br><br>  The previous two Russian versions: for <a href="http://apps4all.ru/analytics/ekonomika-razrabotchikov-2011.html">2011, a report on the Developer Path</a> and for <a href="http://apps4all.ru/analytics/ekonomika-razrabotchikov-2012.html">2012 about the application ecosystem</a> (unfortunately, according to the rules of the Russian publication, direct links are prohibited, do not minus it much ...). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/166829/">https://habr.com/ru/post/166829/</a></p>
