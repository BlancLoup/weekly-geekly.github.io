  <section class="page js-page"><h1>6 student tips</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Six years ago I just came to study at the university.  Not knowing about life and higher education, practically nothing, having neither money nor parental connections, I was just beginning to learn the world. <br>  What did I miss then?  An experienced mentor who would help me find answers to many questions, helped me make important decisions, some kind of authority that could be equal to, a person who had already achieved all that I just wanted. <br>  But, unfortunately, fate decreed that such a person was not ‚Äúat hand‚Äù.  And even parents, who, it seems, should be an example for us, possessing the necessary experience, could not help me, because  they are, in general, fairly simple people and, scarcely, possessed a sufficient outlook in the field of university education. <br>  Several years passed, a lot of events happened, a lot of mistakes were made.  Some of them will never fail to fix.  Achievements, of course, can also boast, but now it is not about that. <br>  I would just like to share my student experience and give some advice to students and applicants so that they may not repeat my mistakes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Tip 1. Learn to communicate, always be able to establish contact with people. </h4><br>  University is an amazing place.  Hardly in your later life you will fall into such a cluster of the most diverse, diverse and interesting young people gathered in one place.  Here you can master the skill of communication to perfection.  Look for the right, "their" people, hold on to them, and learn to respect all the others around you.  Know how to make contact with them.  This is most likely to be a very important skill that will help you out more than once. <br>  Chat more!  Very rarely, single people with autism are well-established in life.  Never forget the simple truth: it is easiest to make friends at school and university; later it will be incomparably more difficult to do so. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/1b9171e1/d2f29bb8/a1fe4b71/b6267c12.png"><br><br><h4>  Tip 2. Focus your attention on the important </h4><br>  Set goals, reach them, rejoice in your small victories, enjoy them.  Repeat this procedure again and again.  Learn to keep your attention on the most important courses, on the most important things <i>for you</i> at the university.  Focus your attention, make plans for the future, but never lose the sense of the present moment.  At the moment, direct all your strength, all your energy. But please, do not lose control over everything else. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/5078c46a/6edfc2c6/ba9656da/9cb96bff.png">

    <h4>  Tip 3. Do not get a job during training </h4><br>  This is very controversial for many, but no less important advice.  Never, never work while studying at a university!  Especially full-time and on a permanent job.  Full-time work is likely to ruin your education, and the ‚Äúsystem‚Äù will diligently contribute to this. <br>  Why?  You lose time.  Do you gain experience?  It is not always useful.  Are you completely sure that you will need in the future? <br>  Just remember that as long as you invest your mind, health and time in the development of someone else's company (it‚Äôs a stranger, your company is a different matter), someone at the same time invests in the development of your personality and intelligence.  What do you think is a higher priority?  Consider this question.  And if the work turns out to be more important for you, then try to answer the question, why do you need education then ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/01912ffa/4caa7ed0/77968757/e561106a.png"><br><br><h4>  Tip 4. Learn, learn, learn </h4><br>  Work on yourself constantly.  You just need to constantly improve, look for new sources of information.  Read, write, solve.  Do not be afraid to express yourself, take part in everything that you consider interesting: olympiads, contests, competitions, grants, trips ... Follow these events and find important and interesting ones. <br>  Do not feel satisfied, having mastered all the knowledge gained in the classroom.  Remember that this is just the necessary minimum.  Not every student achieves success, so you must always be one step ahead of everyone else. <br>  Do not be afraid that your knowledge will not be needed by anyone.  Sensible, intelligent "heads" are expensive.  Knowledge never went unpunished, and labor unpaid!  Do not think that in your case there will be any exception to this rule. <br>  And most importantly, make sure that your <i>"study does not interfere with education</i> . <i>"</i> <br>  There are very few young people who are talented by nature, but most of them have to make their way into life with hard everyday work. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a087f73f/97ffe339/4229fcd5/36bebfe7.png"><br><br><h4>  Tip 5. Pay attention to your estimates. </h4><br>  Everyone knows, perhaps, examples of the fact that some well-known personalities (who will not name their names) have not graduated from the university, but at the same time they feel great in this life, having achieved transcendental success.  But! <br>  First of all, they are far from being proud that universities have not finished, and they do not preach this style of life at all.  Do they give priority to people without education when hiring?  Not! <br>  Secondly, if you declare yourself a troechnik and you will not be bothered by your average score, it is unlikely that this will somehow help you establish your company and achieve worldwide recognition.  Very often, young people find in this simply a reason that will cover their idleness and incompetence in some issues.  True? <br>  Is performance important, your average score?  What do parents and comrades think about this?  Not an authoritative opinion?  Then an example: one of the founders of Google believes that nothing characterizes a person‚Äôs intelligence as well as the average mark of his diploma, namely marks in mathematics and English.  The remaining estimates, in his opinion, reflect a person‚Äôs ability to realize this knowledge in all other areas.  You should know about it.  Think about it now, because you will no longer have the opportunity to correct your grade point average. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/7a36dac6/3b340014/501a3c69/e6efda8c.png"><br><br><h4>  Tip 6. Be epic </h4><br>  Now this phrase is often used to finish speaking at conferences.  For me, its meaning is made up of the following components. <br><ul><li>  Something different from everyone else </li><li>  Be famous, recognizable </li><li>  Cause respect, earn credibility </li><li>  To be better, at least in something </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/51106570/985cc68a/0590569d/a639c8b4.png"><br><br>  If 6 years ago, or at least a little later, there was a person who would tell me these, now obvious, things, I think I would build my university studies and relationships with people quite differently.  Most likely, it would change my life now, and indeed, I would be a different person. <br><br>  Please treat everything said as my personal experience.  I am in no way trying to impose my opinion and do not consider it absolutely correct, but I hope that this will be useful and useful to somebody. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130519/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130519/</a></p>
