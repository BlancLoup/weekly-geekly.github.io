We here are seriously interested in the topic of geeks health and want to talk about it again.  At this time, it was decided to touch on, though rather hackneyed, but surrounded by a bunch of myths and nonsense topics - coffee. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa4/731/e55/fa4731e553364b58a3464cf6d2926941.jpg"></div><br>  Indeed, only lazy did not write about coffee.  Literally every resource, one way or another relating to the topic of work and freelancing, was noted here.  It is not surprising that coffee has been the No. 1 drink in offices all over the world for more than one decade, and at home, people prefer to start the day with a cup of flavored drink in order to quickly remove the remnants of sleep from themselves and properly become aware of the surrounding reality.  And despite the fact that it would seem that doctors and scientists only do what they study coffee and its effect on the human body, they still tell a bunch of tales about him.  Why are there - scientists in many aspects of the effects of coffee themselves can not come to a compromise, since many studies directly refute each other.  And constantly held new ... <br><br>  So let's talk about coffee in the context of only really confirmed (or, at least, confirmed by most researchers) facts - what comes of it, what doesn‚Äôt, how to drink and drink it at all. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">How it works</font> </h2><br>  Traditionally, to seed a little bit of materiel - let's see how exactly the caffeine ‚Äúworks‚Äù in our bodies after getting there by pouring a cup of coffee in our mouth :) 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

      <br>
      A key role in the work of caffeine is played by its base - xanthine, a simple compound of the purine series.  When drunk coffee enters the small intestine and begins to be absorbed, xanthine interacts with the adenosine receptors A1 and A2 located on the cellular membranes of smooth muscles, glandular cells, the central nervous system and other organs.  Here the most interesting begins: the A2 receptor increases the content of CAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate), and the A1 receptor, which reduces its level, is blocked and stops working.  Thus, only A2 remains in the ranks, which launches a whole range of reactions, obtaining the cherished caffeine: <br><br><ul><li>  relaxation of vascular smooth muscle; <br></li><li>  improvement of blood flow in the coronary, cerebral and renal vessels; <br></li><li>  relaxes smooth muscles of the bronchi, intestines and ureters; <br></li><li>  blood flow increases due to a decrease in platelet aggregation; <br></li><li>  and, of course, the most important thing is the elimination of the inhibitory effect of adenosine on the central nervous system. <br></li></ul><br>  From this point on, adenosine ceases to inhibit the central nervous system, overclocked blood provides the brain with a good supply of oxygen - these effects of caffeine are a guarantee that drowsiness flies off us, the thinking process accelerates and mood improves, that is, everything that we drink coffee is happening for.  Well, except for taste, of course.  :) <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">Coffee Horrors</font> </h2><br>  Of course, even though coffee is an integral part of the life of a modern person, it is a drink that carries certain risks and pressures on the body.  And which truth can hurt. <br><br>  Unambiguous contraindications to the use of coffee - hypertension, kidney disease, duodenal ulcer or stomach ulcer.  Well, just in case, know that it is also better not to treat schizophrenics with coffee ‚Äî it can contribute to productive symptoms.  Prove then that you are not a hallucination. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a89/6d0/aca/a896d0acabeb4f3589e992b0d29eb6f2.jpg"></div><br><br>  But even with the health of a bull, you can go too far and get an overdose of caffeine.  To death, it is theoretically possible to drink coffee, in practice - it is unrealistic (an adult will have to drink about 70 cups of espresso for an hour).  But the overdose catch - easy.  Symptoms - headache, stomach pain, agitation (inability to sit quietly in place), psychomotor agitation and confusion to the heap.  Well, sleep this night will be broken, yes.  It releases relatively quickly (plenty of water and better get out into the fresh air), but still, you see, there is not enough pleasant. <br><br>  Well, in general - regular consumption of coffee increases the risk of coronary disease, irritates the digestive tract and creates favorable conditions for the development of its various diseases, and also leaches calcium from the bones.  By the way, coffee dependence is not a myth, ask any doctor. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/UGtKGX8B9hU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhCE9cGe39Lb_W37c7nxThycwic2Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Are you horrified?  Calm, only calm.  In fact, coffee is not so bad.  Why, there - with coffee, everything is fine.  Just drink it right. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">Coffeeman right</font> </h2><br>  So how do you need to drink coffee so that the harmful effects do not set the weather, while the beneficial ones bring maximum benefit? <br><br>  The most controversial topic about which many copies always break - how many cups a day can you drink without showing negative effects?  Here and age matters, and chronic diseases, and BMI (body mass index).  But the general recommendation will be the following for all adults - <b>no more than 3-4 cups throughout the day with intervals of at least 2 hours</b> .  Based on the average caffeine content in a 220 mg espresso cup, this is <b>no more than</b> <b>1</b> <b>gram of caffeine per day</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c57/7fe/f1f/c577fef1f06949d49d805d34b4b29c86.jpg"><br><br>  Coffee on an empty stomach is definitely harmful, so if you have the habit of starting the day with just one cup of espresso without even a sandwich, then it's better to say goodbye to it.  If breakfast after an early rise, in principle, does not come to you (he is familiar with such a problem firsthand) - be patient, wait until the stomach warms up and the appetite wakes up.  And after a snack already and coffee can be drunk. <br><br>  There are lots of recipes for coffee with spices.  Here, again, just be moderate - do not pour cinnamon and coriander with ladles.  In general, the best way is to prepare spicy coffee according to recipes, but not from fashion magazines, but from cookbooks and cookbooks.  And yes, it is better to finish such a dense meal with such coffee, as spices on a fasting alliance with caffeine can irritate your digestive tract on an empty stomach. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/638/511/a32/638511a3289d43b5a17b85b586199e82.jpg"></div><br><br>  As for alcohol, it is not recommended to mix it with coffee (both in the stomach, and, especially right in the cup).  Caffeine and alcohol have opposite effects on the body and the central nervous system and at the same time not only are not mutually compensated, but even on the contrary begin to drag the blanket.  Special liqueurs and balsams for coffee, this also applies.  Do not torture yourself by abandoning them, if you like them, just use less coffee and balms, and if you really want to - do not pour half the cup.  :) <br> <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/3373788"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a5/4c7/07a/3a54c707ac944ba0bc6c07f07c52de3e.jpg" align="right"><br></a>  You will drink coffee carefully, competently and without overdoing it - you will not only walk awake and with a clear mind, but also secure yourself a lot of useful buns: preventing senile dementia, reducing the risk of cirrhosis of the liver and diabetes, improving metabolism and burning body fat and much another.  But here another question arises: how to properly prepare an ancient and fragrant drink so that it is beneficial?  Of course, soluble powders and granules can be safely forgotten. <br><br>  One of the inexpensive (and at the same time one of the most popular) remains this <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/3373788">capsule coffee machine Bosh</a> .  It is easy to maintain, does not require any cleaning-washes, boring manual operations and all that.  I put the capsule in the mood, put the mug, pressed the button. <br><br><br><br> <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/212122"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f3a/02a/f0b/f3a02af0b6da435fa8fd8577908b87b1.jpg" align="left"><br></a> <br>  If you appreciate the taste of freshly ground grains, then you may be interested in such a universal coffee maker: <br>  <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/212122">Philips Saeco HD</a> itself smears the grain, sets the settings, prepares a mug of aromatic drink and cleans up the mechanisms for making the next batch.  Of course, because of the crisis, the price can hardly be called attractive, but believe me, it will quickly work everything to the last penny.  In general, <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/catalog/coffee_machines%3Fsort%3D5%26viewType%3D1%26rec%3Dfalse">there is something</a> to choose <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/catalog/coffee_machines%3Fsort%3D5%26viewType%3D1%26rec%3Dfalse">from</a> .  In addition, we can also buy <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/catalog/coffee%3Fsort%3D0%26viewType%3D1%26rec%3Dtrue">coffee</a> , <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/catalog/coffee_accessories%3Fsort%3D0%26viewType%3D1%26rec%3Dtrue">filters and cleaning pills</a> , as well as <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/catalog/coffee_grinders%3Fsort%3D0%26viewType%3D1%26rec%3Dtrue">coffee grinders</a> , in case you like to roast the beans yourself and cook from the freshest beans. <br><br>  That is, in fact, everything you need to know about coffee, so that its use brings only pleasure and benefit.  Have a nice coffee and see you soon! <br><br><br><br><br>  <b>Health geek:</b> <br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/250808/">How not to sour to old age</a> <br><br>  <b>Computer health:</b> <br>  <b>¬ª</b> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/251026/">Proper nutrition</a> <br><br>  <b>Our reviews:</b> <br>  <b>¬ª</b> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/248110/">Connect original gamepads to PC</a> <br>  <b>¬ª</b> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/247942/">Razer Abyssus: the most affordable Razer</a> <br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/247626/">Nikon 1 S2: one-button mirrorless</a> <br>  <b>¬ª</b> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/246340/">Lenovo Miix 3-1030 Review</a> <br>  <b>¬ªWe</b> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/245854/">understand the art-chaos of the company Wacom</a> <br>  <b>¬ª</b> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/245646/">ASUS ZenFone 5, LG L90, HTC Desire 601 - a two-part war for the consumer, part 1</a> <br>  <b>¬ª</b> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/245210/">ASUS Transformer Pad</a> <br><br><hr><br>  <b>UPD:</b> image with errors replaced. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365577/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365577/</a></p>
