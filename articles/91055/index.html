I would like to share my personal experience in financial accounting, but as an ordinary user of the service. <br><br>  In the corporate <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/finobox/blog/">blog of</a> our company, the features of the service were described in some detail, so I don‚Äôt see much point in describing the principles and technical aspects. <br><br>  Perhaps my opinion will seem somewhat subjective, but probably it could not be otherwise - after all, this post is in the ‚ÄúI PR‚Äù community.

     <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/sslord/view/311245/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b92/45c/4a4/b9245c4a442d729df069a1d8c3a84c13.jpg" width="500" height="334"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Besides the fact that I participate in the project, I have my own small business connected directly with IT. <br>  I am an individual entrepreneur and apply the simplified taxation system (USN).  That is, I have a fairly standard situation and buying an accounting program in a yellow box is like a cannon on a sparrow.  And it is still necessary to keep records. <br><br>  I have some one-time projects, as well as subscription services for certain services.  It is necessary not to forget to issue invoices to clients on time, sign acts for the work performed and pay salaries to employees.  And the most important thing is to pay taxes on time.  Over time, the number of such actions increases and it is simply impossible to keep everything in my head, but as practice shows, initially it was not worth relying only on his memory and writing in notebooks.  From the Excel assistant also failed. <br><br>  I was also worried about a rather banal question - my income is clearly increasing, but where does all my money go? <br><br><h4>  Story </h4><br>  And our project comes to the rescue - <a href="http://www.finobox.ru/">www.finobox.ru</a> <br>  At first, I just fixed all the income and expenses.  And also I got the assets that are called: current account, plastic card, WMR, deposit. <br><br>  Since the system allows you to create separate <u>tabs</u> based on payment filters, I chose for myself just this way of structuring income and expenses. <br><br>  Payments can be recurring: in my case it is the payment of permanent services, staff salaries, office and apartment rent. <br><br>  For example, I have one major client (let's call it Bigkash LLC) for which a large amount of various work has been performed for a long time and in addition to the income from this client, it is necessary to see overhead costs.  For this client, it was convenient for me to create a separate panel (filter by the ‚Äúbig bag‚Äù tag): <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/sslord/view/311315/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/910/647/8b5/9106478b5dcc6dde9424c3344ffbbdeb.png" width="500" height="326"></a> <br><br>  For the rest of the regular customers, I just saved the filters by the names of payers of payments. <br>  For employees who are paid salary each month, has its own separate tab.  Here the filter by the ‚ÄúZP‚Äù tag was configured. <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/sslord/view/311317/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/746/765/956/7467659562d880bb382c273226a946d0.png" width="500" height="265"></a> <br><br>  Quite important and large expenses for me are renting an apartment and an office. <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/sslord/view/311314/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7f7/b65/e2a/7f7b65e2a91de350710ab5a32d0baacc.png" width="500" height="286"></a> <br><br><h4>  Debts </h4><br>  I, like many, have various debts.  Unfortunately, this is how it happens that some customers delay payment, which in turn, after a while, leads to the fact that I can not pay something on time.  In such a situation, of course, it was possible to give a few tips, but I would not like to deviate from the topic, so I would simply advise interested people to read the book ‚ÄúCosts - down, sales - up‚Äù by Bob Fifer. <br>  To keep track of those customers and people who owe me money, I created a dashboard based on a filter that displays revenue with an ‚Äúunpaid‚Äù status for all time. <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/sslord/view/311316/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/121/35a/881/12135a88127192bf916f925396a24a8f.png" width="500" height="289"></a> <br><br><h4>  Documents </h4><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/sslord/view/311313/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/421/7e2/999/4217e2999a5f6d62dfbceeb1d9466b97.png" width="64" align="left" height="64"></a>  For the formation of documents, I use the application "account-acts".  After the formation of documents, this application puts a mark on payments - ‚Äúaccount‚Äù, ‚Äúact‚Äù.  Apart from the fact that I visually see labels on payments, I can also, for example, create a filter that will show me payments that had an account, but the act has not yet been created: <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/sslord/view/311318/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/edf/941/483/edf9414831848a88cc992dbc5258e301.png" width="472" height="322"></a> <br>  With this filter, I can easily see the transactions for which it is necessary to generate and sign a piece of paper, in order to avoid punitive sanctions from the tax authorities. <br><br><h4>  General form </h4><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/sslord/view/311321/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0f0/63c/d16/0f063cd16488704edec62eb326a809e4.png" width="500" height="330"></a> <br><br>  And what about my personal finances and the answer to the question from the beginning of the article?  To keep track of what items my money goes to, I assigned tags to payments: food, clothes, taxi, entertainment, etc.  And, just filtering by tags, I can see the amounts by month.  As it turned out, all the money goes to <s>blackjack</s> drinks and women :) <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  My approach to financial accounting in Finobox, of course, is not the only correct one.  I am sure that you can find many other ways, and, perhaps, more convenient ones. <br><br>  Since the system is expandable through applications that can be created by third-party developers, all this opens up attractive possibilities for using the service.  For example, I look forward to when the Piggy Bank application will appear, which will help me save money for a space flight. <br><br>  PS Note Colombo - all names of firms and counterparties in the article are fictional, coincidences are random. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/91055/">https://habr.com/ru/post/91055/</a></p>
