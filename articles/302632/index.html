This is an 8-day intensive work format in which a group of students is working on an educational project for the web or mobile, listening to lectures and attending master classes by leading local designers.  It is aimed at those who want to improve their skills or get an overview of the specialty for further development.  As a result, the group receives a project from one of the leading domestic Internet companies in the portfolio and good teamwork experience. <br><br> <a href="http://britishdesign.ru/courses/intensive-ux-ui-design/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bc7/c31/ca7/bc7c31ca7cfe2a7d206e46d43c725d20.jpg" alt="Summer intensives on UX / UI at the British High School of Design" width="780" height="289"></a> <br><br>  On the June 28-July 6 course, the Mail.Ru Group designers and researchers will talk about how modern approaches to interface design have allowed the company to make a qualitative leap.  For example, in recent years, the international brand My.com has been launched, entire product lines are being translated into its own design system, mobile applications constantly fall into the official collections of the best for the year on Android and iOS.  We are still in the middle of this path for a large-scale update, but many companies are just starting their way to systematizing the design and our experience will be useful. <br><br>  Students will learn how to work throughout the entire cycle of creating digital products - researching the target audience and the market, creating and testing concepts, designing and designing the interface, user testing and analytics, and presenting and protecting ideas.  On tasks from the largest domestic companies, you will work out the methods and practices of creating UX / UI, try modern prototyping and design tools.  As a result, your portfolio will have a close to real project, and in the summary - a new teamwork experience. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.servdes.org/conference-2016-copenhagen/">ServDes.2016 - Service Design and Innovation Conference</a></strong> <br>  A conference on the design of services ServDes 2016 was held on May 24-26 in Copenhagen (Denmark). <a href="http://www.ep.liu.se/ecp/contents.asp%3Fissue%3D125">Presentations of speeches were</a> published. <br><br>  <em>Fresh links can also be tracked in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/pdigest/">Facebook group of the</a> same name or <a href="http://eepurl.com/bu61XX">received once a month by mail</a> .</em>  <em>Thanks to everyone who also publishes links in it, especially Gennady Dragun, Pavel Skripkin, Dmitry Podluzhny, Anton Artyomov, Denis Efremov, Alexey Kopylov, Taras Brizitsky, Yevgeny Sokolov and Anton Oleinik.</em>  <em>More and more materials in reviews appear thanks to them.</em> <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://eepurl.com/bu61XX">Subscribe to the newsletter</a></strong> !
