  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About it</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This morning I woke up with some kind of incomprehensible feeling that made me just think about the simple things of our technological world.  I did not invent, did not discover anything new, I just looked at this world differently.  I made a reassessment of the obvious things, and it became terrible and sad for me.  I realized that my computer was taken away - I no longer understand what he is doing.  What was taken away from me is right - it is illusory.  I realized that nobody in the world understands where we are going.  I realized. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I remember the terribly distant 2000s on linoleum;  those days when XP came out, when it was said about pirated Windows that it works better, because it is cured of all types of messenger junk.  Those times when the established antivirus with a firewall gave a guarantee of security.  These were times when there was a feeling of complete control over my computer, when there were no thoughts that my useless computer could be monitored, some information was collected (I ask here and further to take into account the context of the word "can" - it is purely technical character determines the potential for an action, rather than conditional, caused by the desire of someone to perform this action). <br><br>  Flew years.  The technology we grew up grew.  Nothing depends on one person, hacker or programmer.  IT giants are no longer playing with these technologies, they are already using them.  They are already playing with other technologies that we suspect and do not suspect.  But this is a topic for another discussion.  This is a topic about technological singularity, about the ‚ÄúBlack Swan‚Äù (read N. Taleb), which can once again turn the world around.  Here is a conversation about what happened, about the "Present Perfect". <br><br>  Snowden showed the world a few slides.  Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, YouTube, Skype, AOL, Apple (did it last until October 2012?).  Reread this list again!  Read carefully!  Don't you think that something is missing here, some kind of company?  That's the point, it does not seem!  Everyone is here.  Everything!  Well, it is unreasonable to assume that hardware corporations would be on this list.  And Vkontakt with Yandex and Kaspersky are in the presentations of Colonel Edward Snezhkov, which he does not dare to give to the media and go to Hong Kong.  Oh, I forgot, we and the media do not have these, give something and no one ...

      Oh, we all knew everything!  We all knew that, of course, if Google wanted it, it could read our mail, that Microsoft constantly collects some unnecessary error reports, that the sneaky Skype hides its inordinately huge body in all possible and impossible ways, etc. <br><br>  We look at the case of Snowden as a movie.  Someone gets more information, some less - but we watch movies, worry, discuss ... Roughly speaking, nothing happened, nobody stopped using g-mailo, nobody deleted Skype, nobody took down their Windows.  Well, the FSO decided to buy typewriters, but this had already been planned for a long time, and it was just a coincidence.  And no one didn‚Äôt touch Eda there for 2 weeks in the transfer zone, he couldn‚Äôt go in there, and the officials said - it‚Äôs impossible, we‚Äôre a democratic country!  Fifty journalists were simply inexperienced and inattentive - they could not find him at all, but he just got tired and slept in a hotel.  And at the press conference were only the most-most independent human rights activists with state diplomas.  sample for independent human rights, and Ed just did not want to see journalists ... Stop!  Enough already! <br><br>  Where is he, what is he, why is he now - this is already a rhetorical question.  For us, he was, and even seems to be there, but somehow he is nowhere to be found.  Yes, "Neo Snowden Schr√∂dinger", what else is there to add. <br><br>  Yet, something has changed.  You no longer need to use the word "can."  Big Brother collects information about us, processes it, stores.  It is personalized information, and it is about me.  I do not know what exactly, to what extent, only Agent Smith knows.  It is logical to assume that "as long as I am nobody," they do not need me.  But then from what level does the interest in me begin?  When do I read an anarchist cookbook?  When do I have a familiar Iranian?  When do I work at the Moscow Thermal Engineering Institute?  Or my father?  Or am I an architect in an innovative project?  Is there any reason to evaluate this level?  Today, I do not fall under their criteria, and after a week, once again connecting via VPN to the work network, Skype will start pulling information.  Or is your Skype company cut?  Hehehe, cut, but not at all, it seems to me, that's exactly it works for you. <br><br>  A certain distinction has been made between the concepts of "may" and "for sure, this is already happening."  And, as it turned out, for a long time.  Now we have the opportunity to realize this and do something.  It is to do it, because life is such a thing that in order to stay in place, keep up, you need to do it, and to move forward you do a lot.  Otherwise, we will remain in the ‚Äúno one‚Äù category, we will enjoy life, the same, carefree one, which is shown by your matrix righteous scanner.  We will continue to write ‚ÄúI‚Äù with a small letter, and ‚ÄúYou‚Äù with a large one.  Edward writes: <blockquote>  ‚ÄúYou cannot wait for someone else to take action.  I was looking for leaders, but I realized that leadership was to act first.  &lt;...&gt; I do not consider myself a hero, because I act in my own interests: I do not want to live in a world where there is no secret of private life, and therefore there is no place for intellectual research and creativity " </blockquote><br>  Would I sacrifice my material goods, or in general my whole life for the sake of principle, just for the sake of my convictions?  Few will respond positively, usually those who respond in this way already live differently.  Naturally, these do not get into the organs, system psychologists know for sure who can be recruited, and who can not.  But let's mentally imagine the NSA's colossus.  Wiki: <blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe number of employees and the annual budget of the agency are state secrets.  There are various estimates of these figures: the number of employees at Headquarters is estimated at 20-38 thousand people;  besides, about 100 thousand work at military bases around the world. ‚Äù </blockquote>  What is the probability that another IT person will run away?  I do not even ask how much this probability is higher than the probability of escape of some manager.  I am sure that 95% of specialists who are confronted with a disgrace that torments their conscience, have periodic desires to hand over all this with giblets.  But this is not happening here at all, as it turned out, it happens with them.  Why?  We used to endure, we were taught this, now we have such a mentality - hello mummies in Red Square.  Wiki: <blockquote>  ‚ÄúCurrently, the Mausoleum is open for access every Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday from 10 to 13 hours.  &lt;...&gt; Access to the Mausoleum is free.  In the Mausoleum, it is assumed, keeping silence and not stopping at the tomb, to make a semicircle around the sarcophagus.  It is forbidden to keep hands in the pockets of clothes, men need to take off the headdress " </blockquote>  Do I dream this? <br><br>  But back to the Ed phenomenon.  I think you can introduce a concept, such as the ‚ÄúSnowden phenomenon,‚Äù when a specialist engaged in extremely difficult mental activity surpasses all his leadership by an order of magnitude, and understands things that he is not supposed to understand.  And for the time being, it is a damn thing for him that he is developing the Death Star, while the process itself delivers it.  But once a bum bites him on the street, and he falls ill with a syndrome of conscience with acute inflammation of a sense of justice.  And he starts to break the system, because he knows how to break it, and he does it!  That is, in theory, the construction of such an ideal global control system is impossible, since there will always be the human factor, fluctuations of consciousness and conscience.  The more the system grows, the more vulnerable it will be to internal influences. <br><br>  Why is everything happening just the way it is?  Here are the big people who are at the head of large political structures that guide the development of society, what are they interested in in general in life?  Do they try to look at a step forward, see how the system they are building fits to the tech society that brings progress.  I think no.  They are not architects - they are managers.  The manager will never be an architect.  But they are trying to build an information system of the state, or of the whole world in general, based on their knowledge not only in social areas, but now also in high technology areas.  Sometimes quite funny results are obtained, especially in this country.  But this is only the tip of the iceberg.  If we scale down along the time axis, it is immediately apparent that it is the current level of development of the society that determines the structure in which this society lives.  And on this scale there are no exceptions.  Yes exactly.  Not such a life - we are.  Not I, not You, but Us. <br><br>  The twentieth century transferred the level from the middle ages to the new time.  Changed the minds of people.  Those who are ahead no longer want to look back.  For centuries, mankind has taught history, and, based on this experience, slowly developed.  Is this approach relevant now?  Is Marx's Capital now relevant?  Here, of course, many will argue, but I can imagine such people, and their positions in society, and their relationship with high technology.  Religions that have been the strongest tool for managing society for centuries.  Are they able to fulfill their managerial function now?  Well, perhaps, only those societies that are slightly delayed with the development of technology, societies for which they are still suitable.  But such countries are not standing still, they are catching up with progress, and their system in a short time becomes unsuitable for society.  I will not continue this sharp topic; there are many countries in the world where such a discrepancy takes place, and we see what happens in them. <br><br>  I do not want my children to learn history at all.  History is no more, history is no longer a source of useful, much less correct information, and the one that is given to us is ridiculously invented.  It is useful for nothing more than the story of Anakin Skywalker.  The story was completely unsuccessful, bloody, vile, we do not even understand it!  So why keep the bad in your head !? <br><br>  We live in a time in which those who look back immediately fall behind.  Technological society people are sick of the dream of creating something new, and from time to time this happens, they invent, and take the lead.  And this process is uncontrollable, some have useful things, others are useless, some are good, others are harmful.  But this is the level of individual impulses and small-medium business, here the ‚ÄúBlack Swan‚Äù occurs rarely in our days.  It is worth mentioning that 20-30 years ago everything was the other way around when corporations were just beginning to realize the ideology of the high-tech world.  At the level of large corporations, it is more and more thoughtful, each technology should pay off, work out its resource.  As long as one technology works in their laboratories or new technologies are being developed and run-in for their sponsorship, nevertheless they make progress, albeit on commercial rails. <br><br>  But all these developments are made primarily to be in the system.  Paradox.  To the giants who have the opportunity to design and develop global information and political systems, the entrance to this arena is strictly closed.  Notice, not Google asks for help from the NSA, how to cope with these restless users, and the NSA controls how Google presents technology to the society.  Somewhere deep in the laboratories of Google, scientists conduct research, development, just doing their job.  And the system has absolutely no interest in this, as long as the technology is not published.  The system controls how the technology is built into the system, and how it serves the system.  And there are things that the system really does not like.  Strong cryptography, free uncontrolled software, anonymous p2p networks.  Yes, and 3-d printers, which will soon learn to print themselves, somehow do not fit into the ideology.  But this is the result of progress.  It is impossible to prohibit or stop.  And then there will be more. <br><br>  The system is definitely needed.  The world does not need anarchy.  But I don‚Äôt want managers to build it, I want Architects to design it.  The system must be open to understanding, otherwise it will not be able to develop in step with the times, with society.  The system must provide only the truth, otherwise it will be different for different people, and as now, cause distrust.  The system should not hide any truth, because incomplete truth is almost a lie.  If the system will satisfy such simple truths, only in this case will the attitude to the word ‚Äúsystem‚Äù change, and it will be written with a capital letter. <br><br>  And what to do?  I think, first of all, to become ‚ÄúI‚Äù with a capital letter.  Because ‚ÄúI‚Äù will be able to do something, and ‚ÄúI‚Äù will wait for ‚ÄúYou‚Äù to come up with something.  And respect someone else's "I", because it, too, with a capital letter. <br><br>  You can stop using Windows, Skype, Facebook - but will it change at least something?  I think the answer is not obvious.  It is also not clear whether the written open version of Windows or Skype can turn the market around.  Or, the system architecture department created under the government will influence the vector of political development.  We do not know exactly what steps are needed to enter a world in which technology works for the benefit of mankind, and not for its oppression.  In which the world system is based on technologies, their positive capabilities, and not the system exploits these technologies, only to be.  But it is impossible to come to such a future without taking any steps. <br><br>  ZY  The future has already come, and we are still waiting ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/187062/">https://habr.com/ru/post/187062/</a></p>
