Which, even with its small-size, low price, results in a rather decent total installation price tag. <br><br>  Lighting control (in terms of replacing standard light switches in rooms) of a smart home is usually done according to a two-module scheme.  In the base of the lamp is mounted a small block "actuator".  The actuator is powered from the network and commutes the power of the lamp, based on commands from the outside.  Commands, depending on the type of the smart home system, come either by radio, or by a separate wired connection, or by the 220V network itself. <br><br>  In the wall switch, or just somewhere on the wall, a second module is mounted - a sensor-button that transmits an on-off command to the actuator.  It could be either a battery pack that requires regular battery changes.  Or something with mains power, requiring replacement of apartment wiring.  Since the standard wiring does not provide for the supply of 220V to the wall switch unit.

      Wiring change is expensive.  Batteries to change regularly (in a pile of devices) is also not particularly pleasant.  Plus, the battery modules are often ‚Äúsupplied‚Äù with a rather original design that will appeal to not all connoisseurs of the ‚ÄúSmart Home‚Äù.  At this stage, people have to make a serious compromise.  Or lay out a lot of money, or put up with the look and stock up on batteries.  Or do not bother with a smart home.  Unfortunately, the last option is chosen by quite a few. <br><br><h4>  What is interesting planned in our system? </h4><br>  Pretty soon, I hope, within 2-3 months, a new lighting control solution will appear, devoid of the shortcomings mentioned above.  Today I want to talk about its features and benefits and listen to the feedback flow in the comments. <br><br>  The solution is single module.  Installed in ordinary apartments in ordinary boxes for ordinary switches without changing the wiring.  Communicates with the outside world via a 2.4GHz radio channel and is powered by the network that already exists ‚Äúin all switches of this country‚Äù.  That is, from the gap of one wire 220V, which goes into the switch. <br><br>  The module is placed in a conventional wall compartment, behind the switch.  The switch will need to be replaced, but not with ‚Äúour brand, with a cool design‚Äù, but with a conventional switch-button without latching.  Such switches are in the lines of all self-respecting manufacturers, for example, for sure there is a Legrand.  Outwardly, they do not differ, they just click when pressed and immediately squeeze out when released.  The appearance of the home after the installation of such a "smart home" will not suffer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dee/05a/4be/dee05a4be4e544546b376163e8c6b7ca.jpg" alt="ready assembly nRF24LE1"><br><br>  Onboard the module is an assembly based on the NRF24LE1 microcontroller (in socket), a single-channel load dimming circuit and a set of GPIO-outputs for connecting peripherals.  The periphery can be a humidity-temperature sensor, a motion sensor or any other "device of your dreams."  Naturally (and only at the beginning), this iron can be programmed with your own hands.  In one image and likeness of the Arduino. <br><br><h4>  "Business plan" </h4><br>  The price tag for the end customer is expected at the level of 1000-1500 rubles.  At the beginning, a limited (50-100 units) series of ‚Äúspecial / souvenir‚Äù copies will be sold at a more expensive (around 5000 rubles) price tag.  For those who want to sponsor the development of the project.  At the end of the sale of the ‚Äúsponsor‚Äù series, all the iron source codes will be opened (a schematic diagram, the sources of the motherboards risers, gerberas for production orders). <br><br><h4>  Questions to the masters </h4><br>  Connoisseurs of the smart home, especially those who plan to do everything with their own hands.  Would you be interested in such a module?  Would you have the desire / opportunity to participate in the purchase of an instance from the ‚Äúsponsor‚Äù series?  Would you buy a regular copy?  Or would you assemble the device yourself on your knee? <br><br><h4>  FAQ </h4><br><h5>  What is so innovative about this project? </h5><br><ul><li>  One module, not two. </li><li>  The final cost of the module in the range of 1000-1500 rubles already in small-scale production </li><li>  Possibility of independent programming and expansion of functionality due to GPIO </li><li>  A simple installation due to the power supply from the 220V break, already present in all switches of your apartment </li><li>  (most likely) Non-low-capacitor power supply </li><li>  Management from a standard non-latching key switch - the ability to choose the type of switch for interior design </li></ul><br><h5>  Why not Z-wave? </h5><br><ul><li>  Closed protocol - not for enthusiasts </li><li>  Low bandwidth - voice will not pass (and its transfer is planned) </li><li>  High price of modules </li></ul><br><h5>  Why not noolite? </h5><br><ul><li>  No encryption. </li><li>  There is no feedback, it is impossible to poll the actuators and find out their current status (on-off ‚Äî at what level is on) </li><li>  Condenser power actuators. </li></ul><br><h5>  Does your dimmer function in the same way as lights in cheap switches?  Does the lamp flicker? </h5><br><ul><li>  The principle of operation is completely different.  We use phase control. </li><li>  There are two principles of control - phase and period skipping.  We have a phase, the frequency remains stable.  But if regulation is applied with skipping periods, then there will be flicker. </li></ul><br><h5>  Will energy-saving lamps work? </h5><br><ul><li>  Normal will, but without dimming, just turn on and off. </li><li>  Special lamps that support dimming should be dimmed, but this is to be tested later. </li><li>  Work with LED lamps at the design stage is not tested, the test will be carried out later. </li></ul><br><br>  NB All answers to the topic of electrical engineering (c) Alexander Rusin, who designs the iron part of this device, but does not yet have an account on Habr√© (but really wants to get it :)). <br><br>  NEXT.  Videos with the first tests of the device are <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/193510/">published here</a> . <br><br>  NEXT2.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/195240/">habrahabr.ru/post/195240</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/192926/">https://habr.com/ru/post/192926/</a></p>
