With the passage of a series of crash tests, the company's machines simply <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/en_GB/blog/model-s-achieves-euro-ncap-5star-safety-rating">broke the equipment</a> .  Now one of the models, Tesla Model S, has demonstrated its own reliability in a very dangerous accident already in the field (literally). <br><br>  The story <a href="http://electrek.co/2016/05/06/tesla-model-s-crash-large-crumple-zone-gallery/">began with the</a> fact that the 18-year-old girl took a ride on her father's electric car.  As usual, the girl decided to take with her friends (4 people at once), and imagined herself to be a Formula 1 racer, immediately taking a huge speed (unfortunately, it is not known which one).  The result is expected: the driver lost control, the car flew off the roadway, and flying through the air 25 meters, at a speed crashed into the ground.  At the same time the car overturned at least once.  The photograph in the announcement shows the condition of the electric car after the accident.  Fortunately, none of the 5 people in the cabin died. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f62/be2/49d/f62be249d9c2468f9ba22e7e2566177c.jpg">

      Moreover, everyone was able to get out of the car on their own, without the help of outsiders.  Yes, some injuries were received, but they do not represent any threat to life.  The young people were immediately sent by helicopter to the nearest hospital. <br><br>  The car is very damaged, but the interior has remained in good condition.  One of the reasons that everyone survived is the absence of an engine in the front of the car, Tesla Model S electric motors are much smaller than the engine and are located in a safe place for passengers.  If an ordinary car got into an accident, the engine could well have entered the cabin after hitting the ground, and if not killed, then the limbs could be broken by those inside.  In addition, Tesla electric car interior is enhanced to protect passengers in an accident. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a1/0ba/e6d/6a10bae6dc8646408200067804b49275.jpg"><br><br>  Thus, the front of the car played the role of the deformation zone, taking the blow and absorbing the impact energy. <br><br>  If you want to see where the car came from, and where it flew, here is a picture: <br><br><img title="Spectacular Tesla Model S crash after flying 82 + ft." src="https://electrek.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/tesla-crash-ramp-germany.jpg?w=590&amp;amp;h=393" alt="tesla crash ramp germany" height="393" width="590"><br><br>  There is no conclusion as such, but, probably, the girl‚Äôs father, in spite of quite probable dissatisfaction with her child, is very glad that he purchased the electric car from Tesla Motors, and not any other car. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372207/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372207/</a></p>
