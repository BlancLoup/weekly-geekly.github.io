The use of robots in the industry began, by historical standards, not so long ago - a little more than half a century ago, but now you can hardly imagine what kind of production without automatic lines, without steel manipulators and watchful robots of glass robots - these iron guys have become part of production processes and go are not going to. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ff/8d8/315/4ff8d8315dfe49959ad3bbc1e70793e5.jpg"><br><br>  Despite such a vast, almost ubiquitous distribution of robots, only specialists fully realize the full range of their capabilities.  In this article, we will open the door to the world of industrial robotics for a wide range of readers: we will describe some types of industrial robots and their areas of application.  You can not embrace the immense in one article, but if readers are interested, we will definitely continue.

    <h3>  So what they are - robots? </h3><br>  There are several classifications of industrial robots: according to the type of control, according to the degree of mobility, according to the scope and specificity of the operations performed. <br><br><h4>  By type of management: </h4><br>  Guided robots: require each operator to control each movement.  Due to the narrowness of the applications are not common.  And not quite robots. <br><br>  Automata and semi-autonomous robots: they act strictly according to a given program, often do not have sensors and are not able to correct their actions, cannot do without the participation of the worker. <br><br>  Autonomous: they can perform a programmed cycle of actions without human intervention, according to predetermined algorithms, and adjusting their actions as necessary.  Such robots are able to completely block the field of activity in their pipeline, without attracting live workers. <br><br><h4>  By function and scope: </h4><br>  Robots are divided by purpose and executable functions, here are just a few of them: industrial robots are universal, welding, machine-building, cutting, picking, assembling, packaging, storage, painting. <br><br>  This is not a complete list: the number of various options is constantly growing and it is impossible to list everything in one article.  It can only be said with certainty that there is hardly any area of ‚Äã‚Äãhuman activity where robots could not make human labor more creative by taking all the monotonous and dangerous part of the work for themselves. <br><br><h4>  Other classification methods </h4><br>  Each encyclopedia, each directory and each manufacturer has its own classification and typology of robots.  Which is not surprising - it is often determined solely by the specific needs and private approach of the person who makes it up. <br><br>  Will this prevent us from examining some samples and understanding what they can do?  Of course not.  Go. <br><br><h3>  Consider the samples </h3><br>  Among industrial robots stands out the products of such well-known companies as Kuka, Fanuc, Universal Robots, some of which we will look at a little lower. <br><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/robots/robot-kuka-kr-quantec-pa-arctic.html"><b>KUKA KR QUANTEC PA Arctic</b></a> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/08d/22a/ba9/08d22aba95c945628fe4b671e9b0b8cc.jpg"></div><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/robots/robot-kuka-kr-180-r3200-pa-kr-quantec.html"><b>KUKA KR QUANTEC PA</b></a> is one of the best palletizing robots on the market.  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/robots/robot-kuka-kr-quantec-pa-arctic.html"><b>KUKA KR QUANTEC PA Arctic</b></a> - its modification, a robot operating at extremely low temperatures.  It is designed to work primarily in freezers, at temperatures down to -30 ¬∞ C.  Electronic and mechanical parts of the device do not need protection from frost, snow, frost, and also do not emit excessive heat.  The range of the manipulator of the Arctic modification, as in the standard KUKA KR QUANTEC PA, is 3195 mm, and the payload is up to 240 kg.  The device is ideal for use in the food industry and in the conditions of the Far North.  In addition to making piles of pallets, the robot can perform other manipulations, because the accuracy of its movements, or more precisely, the stability of repeatability of positioning, is 0.06 mm. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2OcSE8Ya0BE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/robots/fanuc-m2000ia-1200.html"><b>FANUC M-2000iA / 1200</b></a> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/394/71a/7b0/39471a7b0e71475ebf4212b8630da7aa.jpg"></div><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/robots/fanuc-m2000ia-1200.html"><b>FANUC M-2000iA / 1200</b></a> - a five <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/robots/fanuc-m2000ia-1200.html"><b>-axle</b></a> lifting robot lifting up to 1200 kg and moving this load up to 3.7 m - is ideal as a loader, as it works without human participation, which practically eliminates the risk of injury.

Activities such as replacing printing platforms, collecting and storing finished products no longer require the tireless attention of staff. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GoNRTucoErE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Of particular interest are universal robots, since they, by virtue of their purpose, are equipped with the most adaptive control systems. <br><br>  <b>Rethinkrobotics</b> <br><br>  These are robots like Baxter and Sawyer from Rethinkrobotics. <br><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/robots/rethinkrobotics-baxter.html"><b>Baxter</b></a> is a multifunctional robot with two manipulators and feedback and self-learning systems. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/11d/af3/d6b/11daf3d6b8e244a5930df1eb80403ea6.jpg"></div><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fCML42boO8c" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  His 7-axis manipulators are capable of almost everything that a human hand is capable of, including - having feedback and can control the efforts made.  This, plus more design features, makes Baxter safe for living workers - his workplace does not need fencing, and indeed, it takes up little space, which saves a lot of space in the workshop.  A pair of Baxters able to work successfully together. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d17/918/482/d17918482a174e30b143c08aa1cf62b7.jpg"></div><br>  Baxter is also interesting because it does not require thorough detailed programming of each of its actions - it can be ‚Äútaught‚Äù not only through an intuitive visual application, but also right at the workplace - repeating the movements shown, it remembers them and applies them later. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nmPvpxTMMuQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/robots/rethinkrobotics-sawer.html"><b>Sawyer</b></a> - ‚ÄúBaxter's‚Äú younger brother ‚Äùis an amazingly compact and lightweight robot manipulator, it weighs only 19 kilograms and can be installed almost anywhere without taking up much space. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/25f/c56/d43/25fc56d4302a47ce9648312811bb1efb.jpg"></div><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vPth0Q4apLU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The accuracy of Sawyer‚Äôs actions reaches 0.1 mm, which makes it possible to use it in hundreds of types of picking, assembly and other conveyor works. <br><br>  Both robots are easily retrained to perform new functions even without using traditional programming and are just as easy to move from one workplace to another. <br><br><h3>  Hybrid production </h3><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/chpu-stanki/stratasys-infinite-build-3d-demonstrator.html"><b>Stratasys Infinite-Build 3D Demonstrator</b></a> <br><br>  The approach of the Stratasys company, which has created an industrial device of a new type - a hybrid of a robot and a 3D printer, is very interesting. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f5/8c8/39a/8f58c839adc545579dbd7f2862aba6e4.jpg"></div><br>  Of course, any 3D printer has the features of a robot, but here it is a completely traditional form of robotic manipulator, which also has the function of FDM printing.  Stratasys Infinite-Build 3D Demonstrator is intended primarily for aviation and space production, in which its ability to print on vertical surfaces of unlimited area is so important, in accordance with the concept of ‚Äúinfinite-build‚Äù - ‚Äúinfinite construction‚Äù.  Monsters such as the aerospace giant Boeing and the automotive concern Ford, which provided Stratasys with specifications for the required characteristics of the resulting products, are associated with the project. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/648/3a9/f08/6483a9f08c7e4eb48a3639576f57b42b.jpg"></div><br>  The eight-axis mechanism of the manipulator, the abundance of specially designed composite materials for printing, traditionally high quality workmanship ‚Äî everything tells us that this device and its descendants have a great future. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u_pSEhF3q3Q" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/3d-printer-3d-systems-figure-4.html"><b>3D Systems - Figure 4</b></a> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/47f/c51/96b/47fc5196b7e14237ad4c9605b797b6fa.jpg"></div><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/3d-printer-3d-systems-figure-4.html"><b>Figure 4</b></a> of 3D Systems - a modular robotic system for automating stereolithographic 3D printing, no more, no less. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f84/e7e/a30/f84e7ea306004279b6456bc4e0daf93e.jpg"></div><br>  This is a complete automatic system that is capable of producing new products every few minutes - unlike several hours on conventional SLS printers. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/53f/697/11e/53f69711e6be4b30bb08efbd6a56acc5.jpg"></div><br>  In addition, the cycle already includes such steps as washing, separation of supports, and backlight, and not only the primary exposure.

It‚Äôs hard to imagine an operation that this machine with a metal part couldn‚Äôt do.  Hybrid approach: milling the workpiece, fusing the missing parts or printing from scratch and finishing - all operations can be performed with the part in one approach, within one given program, without interrupting the technological cycle.  The size of the processed and / or printed parts is up to 600 by 400 mm, and the weight can be up to 600 kg. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dTD475HxQlA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Such an MFP for metal work has already changed a lot in the production culture of piece and small-scale products, and in the near future this approach may be extended to mass production. <br><br>  <b>EOS - Additive Manufacturing</b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fcc/f98/066/fccf98066c2c466fa6809bd26d5a0266.jpg"></div><br>  EOS has created manipulators that can perform various operations that require the capture and movement of parts.

And this is normal: robots save employers money, and workers are saved from harmful and monotonously dulling work;  robots work around the clock and nonstop;  robots are much more accurate than living workers - they don‚Äôt get tired, they don‚Äôt ‚Äúget an eye out‚Äù, their sensors and positioning systems are able to maintain accuracy up to a hundredth of a millimeter. <br><br>  While we see them still not everywhere - many production processes are hidden from the average user, and usually not very interesting, but very soon it will be impossible not to notice that the vast majority of all material goods are produced by smart machines. <br><br>  Want more interesting news from the world of 3D technology? <br><br>  <b>Subscribe to us in the social.</b>  <b>networks:</b> <br><br> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/top3dshop/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b25/fce/eff/b25fceeffa904b06ba0818fdef351e77.png"></a> <a href="https://vk.com/top3dshop"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c76/ee9/037/c76ee903753346c29abaa49280dfd828.png"></a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/top3dshop/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f91/396/101/f91396101d2b4579bb273636bc6283fd.png"></a> <br> <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/925/e7a/3b7/925e7a3b7e02499e833866f3b09f7674.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403323/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403323/</a></p>
