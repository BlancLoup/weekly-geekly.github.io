If you feel stuck, depressed or do not get the results you want to achieve (in your business or in life), then you should probably revise your goals for the year ahead.  Along with the beginning of the year, high expectations and ambitions often come to us, because our energy and motivation is at its best.  But can you prepare all your goals and objectives, write them down and fulfill them throughout the year?  A lot of things are given to entrepreneurs incredibly quickly, but at the same time, at times, they cannot master specific tasks and goals.  To end this year productively, I will share with you my main secrets of goal setting.

    <h4>  1. Stop internal divisions. </h4><br>  This happens when we are looking for ourselves, thinking about goals.  And then immediately take a step back in fear and indecision.  Instead, it‚Äôs better to just outline the next few steps and start moving.  Actions will teach you.  If something does not work, assess the situation, correct the plan and move forward again.  And most importantly - be decisive in your commitments, go ahead. <br><br><h4>  2. Set an annual, quarterly and monthly goal and do not forget to fix your movements. </h4><br>  While this is important, write down your task, although at times it may seem difficult or impossible.  Torn to shreds such tasks and problems you move forward.  At the end of the week, summarize, if any goals remain unachieved - they should be evaluated once more and after that try to accomplish otherwise. <br><br><h4>  3. Create one common goal - personal self-improvement. </h4><br>  This goal often goes unnoticed in our tasks of ‚Äúdo more‚Äù and ‚Äúget more‚Äù.  I firmly believe that it is not we who make money, but they make us.  Business does not build in isolation - and this is true.  This is a personal and spiritual game that causes you to destroy the freedom of past habits and beliefs, and the path to existence in this world.  Set self-improvement goals each year.  Take a training course or seminar, invest in a mentor, or even start regularly reading a specific blog that will help you broaden your horizons, gain a new way of thinking and, as a result, develop your business. <br><br><h4>  4. Think over both long-term and short-term tasks. </h4><br>  Concentration only on short-term goals will keep you in a state of constant pursuit of "bright and brilliant objects", as well as hunting for cash.  Concentration only on long-term tasks can generate non-cash time gaps as long as you expect large payments or the following confirmations.  The balance of urgent and long-term tasks will provide you with profits, wild success and personal satisfaction.  It‚Äôs like a healthy diet for optimal business, productivity and personal prosperity. <br><br>  Goals should not be the main task of life or control your movement on it.  Goals are not what we have to do for ourselves, but what needs to be done for ourselves.  They should inspire us, light the way for us, strain us and even scare us a little.  But ultimately it is a gift that we give ourselves to move forward. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/243409/">https://habr.com/ru/post/243409/</a></p>
