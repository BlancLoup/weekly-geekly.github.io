  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tenders from the inside - customer's view</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Yesterday, on Facebook, my fellow Internet users got <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kirill.gotovtsev/posts/10152130179860410">hooked</a> .  The theme is simple and difficult at the same time.  The fact is that they are the suppliers of the product (websites, creatives, advertisements), and I am the very client of the public sector that sits on money.  And in me in this role poured a whole tub of resentment and mistrust. <br><br>  I decided to write here when granite appeared in the tape: ‚ÄúTenders are insanity.  No professional will participate in them.  What for?" <br><br>  It seems to me that everyone can answer the question ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù For himself if he finds out where he is going and how he can help. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It is considered (and visible) that tenders contain collusion.  Indeed, it happens very often.  Without it, even often in any way.  This is a trick, and not so much for organizing kickbacks (this is a separate topic), but for providing the very possibility of holding a tender.  How is this - ‚Äúto provide an opportunity‚Äù?  Yes, that's simple: the tender is a bureaucratic prestige, which already not very gifted people in the apparatus are forced to perform.  In the sense of working before the conclusion of a contract with the desired performer is hells ad: about two months of preparing all kinds of certificates, papers and substantiations within the organization - all for reporting in case of what they performed according to the Federal Law.  Imagine that lawyers, accountants, functional customers who were actually taken forever (low turnover) into an organization were very poorly and quickly trained, if not at all confronted with the fact ‚Äúread the Federal Law and do what it says there‚Äù and their usual work is now complemented by a whole bunch of additional processes, reporting and document management.  Naturally, the quality of performance here is lame - there are no skilled performers.  Accordingly, people are not soared and outsource this work from potential performers in a hidden form.  Here you have the reason for "collusion" ‚Ññ1.

      But this is only half the trouble.  There is a second, no less cruel, more about it. <br><br>  Tenders for the next year are born as the execution of a ‚Äúproduction program‚Äù - a plan of activities for the next period (year, three-year plan, etc.).  The plan is not being discussed with state officials (they are descending from above), I was lucky - we collect and manage most of it ourselves.  But this cannot be called luck, rather, the opportunity to choose soldering, but not the time of feeding. <br><br>  How is the process of forming the production program for a non-production enterprise (which performs bureaucratic actions, and not a service on market terms)?  There is a budget for the cost of providing enterprise functions.  Costs are spent on obtaining those or other resources (services, goods) consumed by the divisions / subsidiaries of the enterprise.  By meaning, the divisions responsible for expenses (business executives - for mops, IT specialists - for mice).  Well, everything is usually. <br><br>  It is also usually what we got from a planned economy - rhythm, discreteness of planning.  The deadline for submitting budgets for the next year is appropriate - everyone is starting to exchange cross-requests like ‚Äúconfirm the need of the past year for future planning,‚Äù usually a week or two is allotted for this.  At the same time they are asked ‚Äúand add what to add?‚Äù It‚Äôs kind of bad, if you look at the second part - where they ask about the additive, because the additive is almost always a project, i.e.  the subject of the future, not yet run-in at regular annual iterations, of the tender.  It‚Äôs bad because they start to ‚Äúwant it, because they have asked and it‚Äôs necessary to answer,‚Äù and not because it‚Äôs really necessary.  And when in real life they really need - an amazing feature of a state employee - they are silent, suffer, snort, wait to be given the right to vote at the moment of applying for budgeting.  Moreover, in order to protect their interests (fairly and pleasantly), they even take the initiative to choose a solution instead of experts instead of the role of a customer and run with something in the form of KP to put in the budget.  I still do not understand how to find this gyrus and break them, but oh well. <br><br>  This is the most important problem that you ‚Äúdo not see‚Äù from there at all: there is practically no normal management of needs, changes and projects in the public sector.  It is allowed to just write ‚ÄúI want‚Äù, but how to implement is not your headache.  Naturally, one should not expect any distinct adequacy in the actions of the customer‚Äôs representatives in the process of implementing one or another idea.  The deadlines can be tried to move during the next year (at least to make a resource plan, view the market normally, calculate the feasibility study among the ready-made options caught), but you need to catch the allocated funds in the same year to ‚Äúmaster‚Äù - otherwise the ‚Äúfailure to execute the program‚Äù solders on the premium component of the salary.  Therefore, it is important for everyone to have time to spend budgets on time: to submit the plans on time, and then implement them on time.  The quality of what you pay for remains outside the brackets.  This is another legacy of the planned economy, and the legacy in the minds - on paper everything is already pro-Western, but in reality it is not. <br><br>  This is where the main collusion with a potential contractor begins.  According to the concepts. <br><br>  Suppose I need to implement a service, and I am incompetent to do it myself.  I am looking for an artist in the market.  I‚Äôm looking trivially: google landings or ‚Äúpraise‚Äù websites (you, in fact) or contact the integrator (‚Äúgrazing‚Äù is always assigned to every sector of the economy ‚Äî visiting, interested in needs, to grab an order).  There is no time for budgeting a decision, literally hours, since  The tree of applications must be processed, turned into budget figures and passed on time.  Looking for someone to call and call.  The simplest thing is ‚Äúgrazing‚Äù, if something has not grown together - on the market.  You ask: ‚Äútime-price?‚Äù, You get a sooooo approximate answer and voila - the amount went to the budget. <br><br>  Then the theme develops: in fact, you called the subscriber.  It does not bear any obligations, but if such ‚Äúloyal‚Äù ones are not lured, they will not remain.  Once called, you must at least go to the decision - you let him in on a hidden pre-sale and pre-project examination.  TK itself can not write, because  not the problem itself is solved, but the ‚Äúoutsourcer‚Äù.  In fact, the documentation for the tender is already beginning to be prepared at this moment by the contractor himself - the person who answers the call comes in, clarifies the details and designs the solution on his own technologies or on those available from subcontractors.  Here you can choose what you like, steer the landscape and in general - it all depends on the competence and adequacy of the responsible executor of the task that the tender is preparing.  On the part of a potential executor, these are labor costs that are incurred and must be paid (later).  They are laid in the price of services, although in the estimates then appear rarely. <br><br>  The decision is chosen - it's time to announce a tender.  Announce = collect a cloud of paperwork around the draft contract and TK to publish it, explain to the dense composition of coordinators that you are implementing this ‚Äúbudgetary‚Äù wish list, within the budget limits, to the customer of the Wishlist you show what happened, you are trying to harmonize it.  In any place of the process, looping can begin (people are lazy, stupid, retain their interests), and as a result, it is practically impossible to post a tender on time - if it is not purely yours, but general economic.  From here almost all tenders grow, where the deadline is the last days of December.  From here white threads grow ‚Äúunder the contractor‚Äù in the evaluation criteria, etc. <br><br>  But no one bothers to make the tender open and hold normally.  Only one thing is necessary - so that all market participants become ‚Äúshepherding‚Äù.  For as long as there is no market, there are connections, and this is a bad method for finding a project executor.  You are required to move a little to sell yourself. <br><br>  The first step is to learn about the need ahead of time.  This is easy to do: all state-owned enterprises are required to publish procurement plans for the year right away in January (I am already preparing my own, for example).  Look for the niche of those you serve, go to their sites, the owners are obliged to keep the ‚ÄúPurchases‚Äù section there, which most often leads to zakupki.gov.ru, and there they are looking for a procurement program for a year.  Look for your own topics in it. <br><br>  Then the most difficult moment for ‚Äúproud professionals‚Äù is to kick in, personally, to come and meet.  While there is no TK (and at the time of the announcement of the program on the procurement site it is not in 95% of cases) - the performer ‚Äúby the rules‚Äù has equal chances for you to win.  Even if you leave with nothing, you will be remembered and quite likely they will call in a year.  Further scheme you know. <br><br>  Logging in the system is also possible for us - customers - there is not enough fresh blood of the performers.  Even more. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/191008/">https://habr.com/ru/post/191008/</a></p>
