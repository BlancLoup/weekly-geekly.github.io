  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nearly dismissed under article ... on Habr√©</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I did not write on Habr for almost a year and a half - I settled in at the new job.  Of course, in the IT field.  But the general exacerbation of spring affected our company, there was a reason to write.  The story is this: one of the employees wrote a good post in his personal blog on Habr (NDA was not affected).  A little later, the product manager told him that he had done it in vain and, if he reached the boss, it would be sad - because the general believes that the post to Habr = sent a resume for a new job.  A successful post with a good rating was removed in drafts, the matter was hushed up, we were <s>sleeping</s> together here.  A colleague in sorrow - of course, he wrote to share his experience in development and design, and at the same time to measure karma. <br><br>  My nickname no one knows, the office is not burning down - that‚Äôs what I decided to <s>write a post consolation</s> to talk about the very intangible motivation.  Not buns and chairs, pears, namely moments, so to say, sharing of knowledge. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/324714/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/55a/d85/8d5/55ad858d5e513e30fdbae3314d9833a4.jpg"></a> <br>  <i><font color="#999999">Something like this: a colleague saw his dialogue on the carpet of the boss</font></i> <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h2>  Take away your money </h2><br>  Large, adequate work, wages - this is the best you can dream of.  You are free, you do not think where else to earn extra money, you can buy cookies, fruits and even an ergonomic chair for the office yourself - you still have 10 hours in it, and the spine is not a breech.  But sooner or later the time comes when one material prosperity becomes low - self-actualization is necessary, the personality is actualized, that's all.  Although it sounds a little filfakovski, but in fact, this is the usual need of a normal person. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6c8/c68/10d/6c8c6810d13975ce7614645d2ff84518.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Spring is a time to love and suffer</font></i> <br><br>  So, what do employees want when the salary is arranged, the bonus is skipped, the vacation is over.  This is in addition to adequate and appreciating leadership. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Participation in conferences.</b>  For an IT person, a conference is a way to demonstrate your experience and get ready-made solutions from speakers.  Most hardcore programmer conferences give real-life practical cases that can be safely implemented by returning to the office.  So, for example, our guys after one of such meetings perfectly migrated to Hadoop in just a few weeks.  And another division washed down its micro-mini-virtual PBX in a matter of days.  Now we have it all in production. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Articles on Habr√©.</b>  If I was asked if he was Habr, I would answer in the style of the country in which I was born: "Habr lived, Habr is alive, Habr will live."  With that, I am a girl programmer, that is, not a mumps, and not sea.  The guys refer to Habrahabr as a source of information and a way to compete in the ability to dissolve the discussion and grow karma.  I can not say for sure about the time - but Habr is read at work and I am sure that at least an hour and a half, it is addressed as a reference book, etc.  In my previous work, any post on Habr was the pride of the company and hung out on the internal portal - even if it was just a personal post with a small rating.  And it was an additional motivator to develop and even more powerful work - to demonstrate their expertise. <br><br>  And by the way, the post on Habr and the profile of the employee is not only the pride of the company, but also the possibility of ‚Äúa little otdiaritsya‚Äù, because your company can stand in the profile or directly in the signature of the employee - and this is a lot of examples.  Therefore, it is best, on the contrary, to use the potential to your advantage.  Similarly, at the conference - the employee can come up with real-life cases of the company, distribute branded business cards, etc., that is, popularize your brand. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Open Source.</b>  Developers want to commit, create their projects and use open-source products in their work.  For them, this development, entertainment and, most importantly, the opportunity to share experiences.  They say that a real expert is never afraid to teach and talk about his work - he is confident in the depth of knowledge.  The love for open source is based on the same thing: involvement in interesting (and large) projects, experience, and yes - an extra line in the resume. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Books</b>  Amazon has many books in English that help develop skills and, again, give an understanding of patterns, architecture, algorithms, etc.  Programmers buy electronic and paper books themselves - but if the employer did it, it would be nice.  A manual could make new demands and clarify what is useful for the work can be learned from the read. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Magazine subscriptions.</b>  Same story as with books.  Ironically, printed magazines still offer valuable articles that are not available online.  By the way, we write out the journals to our sysadmins - from there they have already learned some interesting solutions for the internal Linux-oriented IT infrastructure, and one of them even became an evangelical DevOps in the company and actively promotes it. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Learning</b>  All these junior programmers' courses for housewives are not the same story.  There are corporate universities, authorized vendor courses, which, again, provide practical knowledge that can optimize the work of the entire company.  The task of management is not to prohibit, but to encourage in any form: for example, to pay and oblige to work N years or to achieve some specific indicators for M months. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Broadcast experience and mentoring.</b>  Ask your developers to teach beginners or young team members - and you will see how much more loyal to you they will become and how much higher the level of both ‚Äúteachers‚Äù and ‚Äústudents‚Äù will be. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Intangible reward.</b>  You will not believe, but all these letters, t-shirts, badges, backpacks and other sublimation things are of great importance.  I recently chatted with colleagues from my first job and somehow spontaneously turned out to be a flash mob: they laid out in a tape everything that was at home related to a company that has not existed for 5 years already.  Do not believe it: even pens, bags, envelopes, folders and magnets are preserved.  Because it was the memory of the team and how much benefit each of us brought customers and counterparties.  It is an affiliation, and it is valuable. <br></li></ul><br>  Yes, almost each of the above items may be an additional line in the summary of IT-specialists.  But this does not mean that they will leave.  Moreover, if you guarantee them exactly these benefits, they will think seven times whether they decide something extra 10 (a little more) thousand in salary.  This is especially valuable in regions where relocation opportunities to Moscow or St. Petersburg are added to all the other benefits from headhunters. <br><br>  I have been working in IT for many years and noticed one thing: IT people grow up in small regional companies, and they harden into large ones.  Why it happens: <br><br><ul><li>  in a small company, the developer is responsible for a large front of tasks and feels its importance and its expertise <br><br></li><li> in small companies, extreme programming is often practiced without scram and ajaila, which means that skills for creating code and quick production are developed <br><br></li><li>  we do not have testers - each programmer is responsible for covering the code with tests and he later acts as a beta tester <br><br></li><li>  There are no distractions - the work is often more like a programming contest, when everyone quickly writes code and realizes all ambitions in it <br><br></li><li>  no (or almost none) of these faking product managers who breathe in the back of their heads with their sprints, backlogs and critics on a client who has not criticized, but the curves of the user's hand. <br></li></ul><br>  In a large company behind bright offices there is often a swamp: <br><br><ul><li>  bureaucracy <br><br></li><li>  Ajaila, scrams and other games of sexually mature managers <br><br></li><li>  a piece of code that you saw all your life and sometimes you don‚Äôt even know how it will work there in the general system <br><br></li><li>  an office that draws life in it and pushes away the desire to grow further - you feel like a big boss in this leather chair at this poppy table. <br></li></ul><br>  Of course, this is a bit exaggerated, but in part it is.  So any company always has a chance to be friends with developers (and everyone else in general) and keep the team on human relations. <br><br><h2>  And how are you? </h2><br>  Once such a booze has gone, tell us how it is with you and are they firing for posts on Habr√©? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/324714/">https://habr.com/ru/post/324714/</a></p>
