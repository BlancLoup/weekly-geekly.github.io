  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Report of the analytical agency Gartner. Market "clouds" - forecast to 2015</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  According to the analytical agency Gartner, in the next two years, cloud technologies will be extremely relevant and virtually all industries will be replaced by virtualization.  In general, the shifts that can be observed today on the Russian cloud market are quite positive and are estimated as a threshold for global migration to cloud solutions, which analysts are now talking about. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0b3/944/9db/0b39449dbfa6e2654d1c80c061f48fa1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Due to the fact that this area is considered very promising, more than half of the companies plan to invest in it (10% more than last year).  Demand of corporate clients for private "clouds" is growing.  In this regard, in the foreseeable future, the popularity of desktop and application virtualization will also increase.  Up to 75% of respondents interviewed by the agency plan in 2014 to implement the strategy of organizing private "clouds". <br><br>  SaaS is rapidly gaining momentum.  So, according to Gartner, by 2015 more than 50% of enterprises will have SaaS applications. <br><br>  By 2014, the center of the "digital life" of the user will no longer be a personal computer, but PersonalCloud. <br>  Having a single point of control, maintenance, planning and making changes is the main advantage of virtual solutions.  It can significantly improve the efficiency of IT services and reduce the cost of operating IT. <br>  Due to this, the enterprise releases significant computational resources. <br><br>  Today, more and more companies are coming to the conclusion that it is necessary to introduce cloud technologies.  The benefits and advantages of the "clouds" are indisputable.  Thus, 60% of surveyed organizations say that they are ready to implement solutions based on cloud computing technology in the next five years in order to improve the efficiency of business development.  This indicator is almost twice as high as the data obtained in 2009.  Since technologies are becoming a key means of achieving competitive advantage and encompass all aspects of an enterprise, the role of the IT director has never been more significant than today. <br><br>  According to Janet Horan, vice president and chief information officer at IBM, "the winners will come from companies that recognize the enormous potential of technologies such as cloud computing, analytics and mobility, and will be able to use this potential to transform their business." <br><br>  Summing up, we note that the Gartner data show that working with cloud platforms is a serious strategic initiative that promotes the achievement of new business goals that have a valuable contribution to the enterprise.  "Clouds" is no longer just an innovation of the future, but a reality of today.  Russian companies are trying to catch up with the West in this matter and are actively introducing cloud technologies, understanding and using all their strengths. <br><br>  Original Source: <a href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/research/cloud-computing/">Gartner.com</a> <br><br>  - @ActiveCloud <br><br>  <b>ActiveCloud by Softline</b> is one of the leading providers of hosting and advanced cloud solutions for business, operating in the market since 2003 (since 2010 the company has been a member of Softline Holding).  The company has representative offices in six CIS countries and serves about 25 thousand customers.  All services of the company are fully automated.  Round-the-clock support and SLA with financial guarantee of availability up to 99.95% is provided. <br><br>  Clouds are already being used by organizations such as Tinkoff Credit Systems, Eldorado, Sanofi, Natur Produkt, Mospivo and many others. <br><br>  Note that the use of cloud technologies does not require investments in server infrastructure, IT-staff, operation.  Using a simple web-interface, the customer configures the required virtual server by specifying technical parameters (disk space, processor power, RAM, number of cores).  You can manage your virtual server from any device with Internet access. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/165209/">https://habr.com/ru/post/165209/</a></p>
