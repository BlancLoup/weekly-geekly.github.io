Thomas Chang is the product manager responsible for Europe‚Äôs Gigabyte motherboards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/17d/88f/3df/17d88f3df6b0a4572b561ecb999b4a85.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After consulting with members of the <a href="http://occlub.ru/">OCClub.ru</a> team about questions that would be interesting to receive an answer, I arrived at the office in three hours.  But Mazur (the editor of one well-known resource who was supposed to make me a company as asking questions) was late, and I had the idea to make some pictures of the office. <a name="habracut"></a>

Oh.  The company's roots lead to Asia in Taiwan, and Asian motifs on the lockers fit very well into the interior of the office. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3bd/0cf/1ab/3bd0cf1aba188048637b14441b03fa1a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is a pity to throw out the boxes from the boards to the employees of the company and they prefer to put them on the cabinets.))) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7fd/7bd/10a/7fd7bd10a60cd6431b13a48715d1fdd4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And who is tired of work or decided to smoke can go to the balcony.

Do not believe if they say that there are no boards for tests))) <br><br><img src="http://img208.imageshack.us/img208/166/dsc0223p.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, the ideal order in the workplace - the main guarantee of successful work. <br><br>  An hour later, Mazur appeared and we started. <br><br>  <i>Thomas, tell us about the upcoming Gigabyte X58A-UD9 motherboard.</i> <br><br>  Gigabyte X58A-UD9 will be officially announced by the end of April, and so far there is little information about the board on the Internet.  At the overclocking event held in Taiwan, several world records were made at once in the upcoming new product.  The Intel Core i7 980X processor was able to overclock higher than 6.5 GHz by the hands of the best overclockers of the planet.  This high result was contributed by 2 eight-pin power connectors of the processor.  After all, before on our boards this could not be found.  24 phase system is responsible for the power supply, which is also a kind of record for the number of phases.  USB3.0 and SATA III are also present as mandatory connectors for a modern motherboard.  The highlight of the board will be a special USB port for charging Iphone, Ipad.  This is our unique innovation. <br><br>  <i>Yesterday I looked at the photos of the board on the Internet, and they differed slightly from your presentation in the presentation</i> (Thomas showed the board showing in the presentation. By the way, the question of the need for a port to charge Apple devices disappeared as if by itself. After all, we watched the presentation from a Macbook and next to Iphone lay in acid green cover) <br><br>  Yes, initially on the radiator hiding two Nforce 200 chips, the number 7 was beautiful. After all, the board has seven PCI-Express x16 expansion slots.  This should satisfy demanding users who want to put a maximum of video cards in their systems.  But the final design of the board will still be the number 9, showing the model of the board. <br><br>  <i>At the moment you are using the technology of the virtual phases of the power processor.</i>  <i>When will the phases become real?</i> <br><br>  At UD9, these are the real phases, all 24 are real.  In the future, the phases will be real, and their number will vary depending on the voracity of the processors. <br><br>  <i>And why on the motherboards on the P55 chipset is used a high radiator in place of a nonexistent chipset?</i> <br><br>  On the lower segment boards, the radiator is absent due to its uselessness.  And on more productive solutions, this radiator serves as an element for cooling the power supply of the processor and the south bridge, because the heat removal area is larger.  And it just fits perfectly into the design of the board.) <br><br>  <i>It is believed that the future of processor power systems (VRM) will be digital, as for example done on the EVGA Classifield.</i>  <i>Is Gigabyte working in this direction?</i> <br><br>  Yes, we are working with digital VRM, and in the near future we will present our achievements. <br><br>  <i>Will new proprietary technologies be announced on Gigabyte motherboards in 2010?</i>  <i>Maybe Ultra Durable 4?</i> <br><br>  In fact, nothing new will happen.  Coordinated new was the introduction of the port for charging Apple.  But Ultra Durable will remain in the third version for now, but the design of cooling systems for motherboards will change.  We plan to present it at Copmutex 2010. <br><br>  <i>On April 27, new AMD six-core processors will be announced.</i>  <i>Will the support for new processors be old motherboards?</i>  <i>Will it be possible to unlock the cores on the new AMD 890 boards?</i> <br><br>  BIOS versions with support for new processors can now be downloaded from our official website.  And the possibility of unlocking the cores will be present on the new boards.  We do not see the need to remove this ‚Äúloophole‚Äù from users, and we want to give them maximum pleasure from communicating with our boards. <br><br>  <i>The line of Gigabyte motherboards on Intel P55, X58 chipsets was very successful and interesting.</i>  <i>But we are already looking forward to information about new chipsets of the sixtieth series.</i>  <i>Should we expect the continuation of a triumphal procession of motherboards of a new generation?</i> <br><br>  I really hope for the success of the new boards.  We make every effort to at least repeat success.  New boards will receive just the new design of the cooling system.  This is all I can say about the updates.  Everything else is under the NDA. <br><br>  <i>Thank you, Thomas, for the pleasant conversation.</i> <br><br><img src="http://img232.imageshack.us/img232/1359/dsc0220x.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  PS And then came the turn of Thomas to ask me questions) And first of all he asked: <i>How to translate Habrahabr?</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/91647/">https://habr.com/ru/post/91647/</a></p>
