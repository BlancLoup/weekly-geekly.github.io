  <section class="page js-page"><h1>C ++ in 2015</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d08/ee9/aeb/d08ee9aeb4fd46feb35851efd01b303a.png" align="right">  The year is just beginning, so let's see what C ++ expects in 2015, as we already did in <a href="http://meetingcpp.com/index.php/newsreader/items/c-in-2013.html">2013</a> and <a href="http://meetingcpp.com/index.php/br/items/c-in-2014.html">2014</a> . <br><br>  Last year brought <a href="http://www.bfilipek.com/2014/12/c-status-at-end-of-2014.html">many changes</a> , the main of which, of course, is the standard <a href="http://meetingcpp.com/index.php/br/items/looking-at-c14.html">C ++ 14</a> .  What is important, C ++ 14 today exists not only in the form of a standard, but also partially supported by GCC and Clang.  Visual Studio also supports some (though not all) features of C ++ 14 and almost all (although again not 100%) features of C ++ 11.  The compiler from Intel has become fully compatible with C ++ 11.  Thus, modern C ++ standards are available for all platforms - there would only be a desire to use them! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  C ++ Standards </h4><br>  Let's start with the classic C ++ standard in the understanding of ISO.  If this year you plan to switch to a new version of the standard in your project or start a new project, your choice is C ++ 14.  Technically, C ++ 14 just recently <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm%3Fcsnumber%3D64029">became the official ISO standard</a> .  In 2015, I would very much like to see its full (or at least partial) support by all major compilers. <br><br>  There is one more thing.  There is still little clarity on this issue, but by the end of 2015 there is hope to see some form of a draft standard C ++ 17.  Some things are already known from last year's meeting of the committee in Illinois - concept support and improvement in the part of parallel / multi-threaded programming is expected.  If everything planned enters the standard, there is a chance that C ++ 17 will change the world of C ++ more than any of the previous standards.  Of course, this will be so only if all theoretically planned features will be included in the standard, such as support for <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/infopulse/blog/203724/">renewable functions</a> (await / async), which so far is only in Visual Studio. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Thus, it will be very interesting to follow the development of all these planned language additions.  The January meeting of the committee will be devoted to concepts, so their inclusion in the C ++ 17 standard looks very likely. <br><br><h4>  Community and blogs </h4><br>  In 2014, many new C ++ communities appeared.  And not only in Europe and the USA, but including in India.  At the Meeting C ++ conference there were guests from Australia and South Korea.  I think this trend will continue in 2015 - the existing groups will expand, new ones will appear.  Here are the user groups of Europe known to me: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b3d/570/b84/b3d570b84b53e0529f6934c9d84ab1be.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I also noticed that many people began to write more actively articles on C ++, there are already 93 different feeds on blogs, YouTube channels and C ++ libraries in my RSS reader.  If you want to read something fresh from C ++, start with Meeting C ++, reddit, hackernews and isocpp.org. <br><br><h4>  Libraries </h4><br>  I said last year that the growth and development of many libraries are waiting for us - and that‚Äôs what happened.  2014 was a very good year, many companies laid out interesting developments in open source, github continues to delight us with good C ++ projects in various fields. <br><br><h5>  Boost </h5><br>  <a href="https://kylelutz.github.io/compute/">Boost.Compute</a> became the first library adopted in Boost this year.  There is hope to see two releases of Boost in 2015, many interesting libraries are under consideration.  If you want to participate in the development of Boost - joining the review can be a good start.  Also last year, at the C ++ Now conference, the ‚Äúincubator‚Äù of the Boost library was presented, and today there are already 16 libraries in it, to the development of which you can join. <br><br><h5>  Qt </h5><br>  In December, Qt 5.4 was released, significantly improving support for the Android operating system library and development for embedded systems.  QML is now a full-featured interface development tool for both mobile and desktop applications, and in 2015, Qt will continue to delight us with new features.  Qt 5.5 release is expected in late April. <br><br><h4>  Instruments </h4><br>  Also in 2015, the C ++ language tools will continue to develop.  On the IDE market, a new potentially powerful player is entering the scene - CLion.  We are also waiting for Visual Studio 2015 with its support for Android and the new C ++ standards. <br><br>  GCC plans to release version <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-5/changes.html">5.0</a> , which will bring support for OpenMP 4.0 and full (?) Support for the C ++ 14 standard. <br>  The remaining development tools will also continue to evolve.  Maybe <a href="https://www.biicode.com/biicode-open-source-challenge">biicode</a> will become an open product? <br><br><h4>  Important Dates </h4><br>  Let's look at some important dates for the C ++ language in 2015.  First of all, scheduled committee meetings: <br><br><ul><li>  January 26-29: ISO C ++ concepts meeting, (New Jersey, USA) </li><li>  February 23-27: ISO C ++ Library meeting, (Cologne, Germany) </li><li>  May 4-9: ISO C ++ Spring Meeting, (Lenexa, Kansas, USA) </li><li>  October 19-24: ISO C ++ Fall Meeting, (Kona, Hawaii, USA) </li></ul><br><br>  In addition, the following C ++ conferences will be held: <br><br><ul><li>  February 27/28: C ++ Russia </li><li>  May 5-6: ADC ++ </li><li>  April 21-25: ACCU </li><li>  May 11-16: C ++ Now </li><li>  September 20-25: CppCon </li><li>  December 4-5: Meeting C ++ </li></ul><br><br>  The Meeting C ++ 2015 conference, as well as some others, has not yet been announced.  Her announcement will be in mid-February. <br><br>  This year should be a good year for C ++. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/248253/">https://habr.com/ru/post/248253/</a></p>
