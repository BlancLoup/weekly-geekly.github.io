We decided to go back to basics and asked Oleg Hrienko to write another article about the monetization of content projects.  This time we will talk about working with direct advertisers, namely, about what actions to take after attracting them to the resource. <br><br>  Finding an advertiser for your online project is no easy task.  Its solution requires serious preparation from the owner of the resource and special skills from the sales manager.  Therefore, it is doubly insulting when the first placement is the only one, and the client leaves. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This demotivates the team and makes impossible serious business planning.  In addition, a departed customer can share his negative experiences with his colleagues, which complicates the task of finding a replacement for him. <br><br>  Preventing the departure of the advertiser is the most important task of the project manager.  If the product is still raw, it is necessary to use all possible arsenal to ensure the effectiveness of the placement.  Rely on chance or subjective assessment of the quality of the resource can not under any circumstances.

    <h4>  What does the advertiser want from placing </h4><br>  It is necessary to invest in the heads of sales managers the idea that finding a client and getting payment from him on the bill is only part of their work.  It is much more important to figure out what exactly the advertiser wants to receive from the placement.  No fantasy on this score is unacceptable!  Only accurate and objective knowledge.  The information obtained will help both the work to achieve the result and further negotiations with the client on the extension. <br><br>  The worst option is if the customer wants to receive sales as a result.  This means that he intends to shift his work to create his own ‚Äúselling site‚Äù, traffic management, marketing, etc.  on the advertising platform.  That is, it requires the advertising medium to perform the functions of the agency.  Most likely, such an advertiser will be a one-time, although this is not a reason to refuse to work on the extension. <br><br>  It is better if the advertiser has already formed a list of metrics for which he will monitor the performance of the site.  These can be calls, time on the advertiser's site, total number of conversions, CTR.  It is important that these metrics be formed on the basis of client experience. <br><br>  It would not be superfluous to find out where it was located earlier, what results it received and whether it considers its advertising activity successful. <br><br>  Managers are often shy about asking advertisers about this.  Such behavior should be stopped and the order should not be accepted for work until the necessary questions to the client, at least, are asked. <br><br>  The situation can be complicated if your client works through an agency.  Media buyers rarely disclose their methodology for evaluating site effectiveness.  But this is not a reason to despair.  Necessary metrics will be given by service like similarweb.com.  Enter the address of the advertiser‚Äôs resource into it and you will know what quality of traffic the client is counting on. <br><br>  If your product is more difficult, nothing will be left but to learn from the experience of competitors and see what indicators their regular advertisers received for similar campaigns. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3e4/537/4fb/3e45374fb8dd49c48909815bf6a26553.png"><br><br><h4>  Test first </h4><br>  Do not be afraid to test your advertisers before the placement.  Metrics in order to find out to understand how in reality you correspond to them.  There is nothing wrong with creating a copy of the client‚Äôs site with your phone and order form to pre-verify effectiveness. <br><br>  If the test scores are good, you can please the sales manager with this information and strongly advise him not to take seriously the client‚Äôs possible complaints about poor results - this is just a bargain with him or a veiled request to roll back. <br><br>  However, if the results are worse than expected (especially if the results on the advertiser's site are worse than the data on similarweb), it is urgent to take measures to ensure that the client is satisfied with the work with you. <br><br>  We list the main problems that you may encounter on the test results: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Not enough traffic</b> <br>  One of the most common problems of young portals.  The main method of solution is the expansion of advertising space and formats (text announcements in articles, TGB, mailing on its own base of subscribers, etc.).  However, this may not be enough. <br>  Landing will come to the rescue here on your own website where cheap traffic from other resources is bought (teaser networks, context, affiliate programs, social networks). <br><br>  <i>Important: when buying traffic, you should not compete with your own advertiser.</i>  <i>He did not pay you to reduce his overall effectiveness.</i> <br>  Landing ‚Äúwarms‚Äù the purchased traffic and, as a result, the advertiser receives targeted visitors with the desired characteristics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da8/12a/402/da812a40291f4b10b2b7e3c25cb5973c.png"><br><br>  It is necessary to take into account that the quality of traffic ‚Äúsifted‚Äù through a landing page is inversely related to its conversion.  It is necessary to determine the ‚Äúgolden mean‚Äù between the clickability of the landing page and the quality of the audience delivered to the advertiser. </li><li>  <b>Bad behavioral metrics on the advertiser's site</b> <br>  Some advertising formats (for example, branding) can generate a large amount of traffic, but give poor results on the advertiser's site.  If this turned out to be true for your case, the following measures should be taken: <br><ol><li>  Replacing advertising materials with more targeted ones </li><li>  Disabling advertising for mobile devices (very often, the advertiser‚Äôs resource is simply not optimized for mobile devices, which is why its quality indicators deteriorate with enough traffic) </li><li>  Using landings for buying traffic on external resources, as well as better conversion of your own.  Using this method, you add the maximum quality traffic to the advertiser. </li><li>  Disable bots.  Especially true if you have already made a landing page to solve the problem of insufficient traffic.  Many sources can give you bots instead of live visitors.  It is necessary to screen out such partners and disable </li><li>  The narrowing of the audience on which advertising is broadcast (all the same as with mobile devices) </li></ol></li><li>  <b>Not enough calls</b> <br>  Immediately it should be said that usually all the metrics of advertisers for this indicator should be divided into two.  Advertisers will never report their real minimum on calls.  But you can always figure it out through more experienced competitors.  A few hours spent on the ringing and bargaining will give more accurate indicators than the assurances of customers. <br>  To increase the number of calls, the same scheme with landing pages is used, however, the purchased traffic should be more targeted, aimed at the call.  In addition, you can use the ‚Äúnot announced‚Äù by the advertiser action of the form ‚Äúevery third caller receives a gift from our portal - a tablet‚Äù. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Final bargaining </h4><br>  The end date of the campaign is approaching.  You have received all the necessary metrics and are ready to roll over the client.  Give a few days before the end of the campaign a task to your sales manager and equip him with all the information about the current placement (number of conversions, impressions, CTR).  Tell him not to worry about the possible negative reaction of the client.  If you did everything right, then this is just a game to bring down the price. <br>  In the end, if a client talks to you, and does not immediately hang up or constantly demands the return of invested funds, this is a sure sign that he is ready to buy further. <br><br>  At the same time, the maximum task for the seller is not just to save the customer, but to increase the cost for him.  Actually, here all the talents of the seller must be fully manifested: the ability to bargain and convince a customer who already knows the product more or less. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/820/d6c/668/820d6c66875343519d95968a53714efc.gif"><br><br>  <i>A good and interesting test for a sales manager.</i>  <i>It is recommended to introduce a rule: there can be no prolongation without bargaining.</i>  <i>This is fair - you do everything to make the client get the best result for himself, so why would he in turn not pay you the most out of what he can.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292900/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292900/</a></p>
