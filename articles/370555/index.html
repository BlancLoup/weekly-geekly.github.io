You may even know what ICO is - a crowdfunding model in which the project puts on sale tokens that give their customers some privileges.  We won't go far for examples: Polybius tokens guarantee a share of the company's profits, 20% of which will go to their owners. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d5a/cf7/6dc/d5acf76dc5df484ca9dc5467fcc638a1.jpg"><br><br>  In essence, a token is a smart contract.  In the case of "Polybius" - a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.  Of course, smart contracts can be written not only on ‚ÄúEther‚Äù, but it is the most popular, well-known and most trusted.  Therefore, the choice did not have to suffer much. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Basic Polybius Token Facts </h2><br>  Or what you can read in the PLBT smart contract source code:

    <ul><li>  all Polybius tokens were released before the start of ICO </li><li>  the cost of the token is $ 10 </li><li>  In the first 48 hours of ICO, tokens were sold with a bonus of 25%, after which the bonus began to decrease by 5% per week. </li><li>  the number of tokens sold by the end of ICO will be taken as 93%.  5% on top will go to the founders of the Polybius project.  The remaining 2% will go to the bounty - various rewards to people who supported the ICO </li><li>  the number of tokens is initially limited: there are 20 million of them in total - and this means that the ceiling of fees at ICO minus the share of founders, bounty and bonus tokens is less than $ 180 million. Even if the last day of accommodation for us on a snow-white yacht, the holds of which are packed with money, Alisher Usmanov, we will not be able to sell him more. </li><li>  at the end of the ICO, unsold and unallocated tokens will be destroyed.  The release of new tokens is impossible under the terms of the smart contract. </li><li>  after ICO, it will be possible to trade tokens on cryptobirds. </li></ul><br>  From an investment point of view, the Polybius token is unique, first and foremost, because of the project behind it outside the cryptomir.  Yes, we call Polybius a cryptobank and a blockchain bank, which is true, but it‚Äôs still the project‚Äôs insides.  The facade will be a respectable universal bank, which equally can accommodate both a fashionable cryptostartape account from the Zug valley and retirement savings of the respectable Frau from Dresden.  Both their money and its money - fiat money - will ensure the value of the PLBT token for as long as Polybius itself will exist (yes, it will last for years). <br><br>  The profit of the bank in fiat currency makes the token a more predictable investment - cryptocurrencies are very <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C">volatile</a> in nature (we already speak like real bankers, do you notice?).  We don‚Äôt have to go far for examples: Ethereum‚Äôs frantic growth <s>since the cryptomer learned that Polybius tokens would be released on it</s> - on the one hand, and the rather noticeable Bitcoin failure of the last days, costing us about $ 2 million after we <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/polybius/blog/290081/">reported</a> about passing the twenty millionth mark of fees - on the other.  Don't worry, we knew what we were going for. <br><br>  Being secured with fiat money, but being a crypto product in essence, the Polybius token is at the junction of two worlds - and taking the best of each, as we would like to believe.  And this makes it unique, we would even say must have been an element of a balanced investment portfolio. <br><br><h2>  And dividends will be? </h2><br>  The question of the month to which we answer every day: how do token holders know that even after reaching the operating profit, Polybius will start paying dividends?  Everything is very simple here: under the terms of the ICO, payments to tokenholders are tied directly to the profits of the Polybius project.  Everything will be very transparent, reports on the financial condition of the bank will be issued quarterly - not because we are so kind, but simply with reporting in Europe <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/polybius/blog/287938/">everything is strict</a> .  At the end of each fiscal year, net income will be recorded after deducting all expenses and paying taxes, 20% of which will go to payments to tokenholders.  Thus, every year when we have a profit, tokens will have dividends. <br><br>  There are two important points here: <br><br><ul><li>  Token holders are the founders themselves and the key persons of the project.  Our plan for disposing Polybius profits is now as follows: 20% go to tokenholders, 80% are reinvested in the development of the project.  Thus, the owners and management of Polybius will receive dividends from it on a par with all ICO members. </li><li>  Let's not forget that the main value of any ICO are the tokens themselves.  They have their own price, for the period of placement the component is $ 10.  At the end of the ICO, the tokens will be added to the listing of a number of large cryptobirds, their course will begin to live its own life, depending on the news and the success of Polybius.  As the bank grows, so will the rate of the token.  With each new dividend payment, the token rate will increase again. </li></ul><br><h2>  Why will the rate of Polybius tokens grow? </h2><br>  In the coming year, we see at least three events that should positively affect the token rate: <br><br><ul><li>  Completion of ICO and access to US exchanges.  Now the US financial legislation does not allow US citizens to participate in the ICO.  One of the largest law firms in the world, Hogan Lovells, who advised us on this issue, recommended limiting sales to America, and now everyone who registers on <a href="https://polybius.io/">polybius.io</a> sees a strict warning that US citizens should not participate in the ICO.  Of course, this lowered our potential fees.  But on the other hand, it is good for token holders: after entering cryptobirds, citizens of any countries can get the opportunity to buy them without restrictions.  And we expect that the Americans will immediately raise the PLBT rate. <br><br></li><li>  Launch of the Digital Pass prototype.  So far we have not talked much about this idea.  However, now, when the amount required for its development and launch has already been collected, we will be corrected.  Digital passport under the working title Digital Pass is a tool for managing and accessing sensitive personal information on the blockchain.  Its task is to reliably and reliably replace paper documents and the user's personal presence in contacts with public and private institutions.  This will provide an opportunity to remotely receive financial, medical and other services, traditionally requiring a personal visit, presenting original documents and / or a personal signature, or receive services previously available only to residents of the country.  Now we are talking about European countries - no matter how tightly connected the EU is, there is still no single credit history or medical insurance database, so a citizen of one EU country may not be able to get a loan or medical insurance in another.  Polybius Bank, and in the future, our trusted partners, for example, credit agencies, will confirm the accuracy of the information originally submitted by the user (roughly speaking, he is him), and the blockchain-based Digital Pass technology guarantees protection against distortion, forgery or removal of materials.  We plan to roll out the √ü-version of DP within six months, and this event should also spur interest in the project and, accordingly, the PLBT course. <br><br></li><li>  Access to new major stock exchanges.  Now the list of future sites where PLBT can be traded includes litebit.eu, btc-alpha.com, c-cex.com, livecoin.net, spacebtc.com, cryptodao.com, bittylicious.com.  We are planning to enter even larger exchanges, and we expect that each such announcement will push the PLBT rate upwards. <br><br></li><li>  Run the bank.  Obtaining a license <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/polybius/blog/288098/">in one of the European countries</a> can take from 4 to 24 months.  When this happens, the owners of the Polybius tokens will celebrate the breakthrough of the course, and all the others will look at them and regret that they have not invested in PLBT ‚Äúwhen they were ten each‚Äù. </li></ul><br>  However, we would not recommend to rush to resell tokens.  All the fun will be after the launch of the bank, key products and the first dividend payments - that's when PLBT will rise in price for real.  And before that, better be patient. <br><br>  You can invest in Polybius tokens, as long as they are ten each, right now at <a href="https://polybius.io/">ICO</a> .  Until June 21, tokens are sold with a 10% bonus.  Currently, ICO fees are $ 20.3 million in dollars. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370555/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370555/</a></p>
