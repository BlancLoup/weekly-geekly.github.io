      It's nice that our favorite company accepts crowdsourcing as a modern tool. <br><code>&nbsp;</code><br><br><h2>  Short story </h2><br>  The project was launched in 2008.  Since then, only 3 constructors have been released: <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/211">Shinkai 6500</a> , the Japanese adore their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSV_Shinkai_6500">scientific submarine</a> , capable of diving to a depth of 6500 meters, </li><li>  <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/439">Hayabusa</a> , again the Japanese love their <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F%25D0%25B1%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0_(%25D0%259A%25D0%2590)">space station</a> , which studied the asteroid Itokawa and successfully returned to Earth with soil samples, </li><li>  <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/4038">Minecraft</a> ! </li></ul><br>  Several projects scored the required 10,000 votes, but were rejected by Lego.  For example: the sets for the film "Zombie by the name of Sean" and the TV series "Firefly". <br><br>  There are several projects that have scored 10,000 votes but have not yet passed the test of the company.  One of the last: the designer of the <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/3431">Mars rover Science Laboratory</a> and <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/1786">UCS Sandcrawler</a> from Star Wars.  But perhaps the most attractive for the inhabitants of Habr will be the designer for the game ‚Äú <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/18258">Portals</a> ‚Äù! <br><code>&nbsp;</code><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  rules </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/180/98e/b38/18098eb38a587a342a545f4d8c5a98a4.jpg"><br><br>  Participation rules are as follows: <br><ol><li>  We first register on the site so that you can vote, discuss and add your projects. </li><li>  Then we invent our project and upload it to the site. </li><li>  How do we want to collect 10,000 votes from registered on the site (you can register through accounts on Facebook or Twitter). </li><li>  If the project has scored ten thousand, it does not mean that the designer goes into production.  Lego team must check and decide whether to release or not. </li></ol><br>  A constructor may be rejected for several reasons: <br><ul><li>  the presence in the plot of a positive image of bad habits, such as alcoholism (the film "Zombie named Sean"), </li><li>  violence and other non-childish joys, </li><li>  but the main indicator is the lack of playability. </li></ul><br>  After all, Lego is children's designers, despite the fact that many adults continue to play it.  A short video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Ffeature%3Dplayer_embedded%26v%3DU6yDJA2a4lM">how this works</a> . <br><code>&nbsp;</code><br><br><h2>  A small review of projects </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ec8/b25/3f1/ec8b253f16fa97098d75efea4deeb517.jpg"><br><br>  Of the more than 3,000 projects proposed by users, only about 500 scored more than 100 votes, and about 50 more than 1,000. Lego initially set the bar very high, it is very difficult to achieve 10 thousand votes.  For any need an additional campaign in social networks.  So did Minecraft fans and create a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/LEGOMinecraft">separate community</a> . <br><br>  There are a lot of board games, <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/131">chess</a> , <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/17173">reversi</a> , <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/15161">monopolies</a> , <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/15481">Plants vs. Zombies</a> , <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/11292">Scrabble</a> and all sorts of projects among the projects. <br><br>  There are several projects for fans of Apple products: a <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/10142">store</a> , an automatic <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/11850">stall selling iPhones</a> , a <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/1151">portrait of Jobs,</a> and even the designer of the <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/24923">iPhone</a> itself.  However, Android fans also advanced their <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/22758">logo</a> and scored more than 7 thousand votes. <br><br>  Of course, there is a wish to collect <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/555">Wall'e</a> with <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/18739">Eve</a> .  There are projects on " <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/18262">X-Men</a> ", on " <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/15739">Star Trek</a> ", " <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/14530">Scooby-Doo</a> ", " <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/10944">Lord of the Ring</a> " and even on the program " <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/13466">Destroyers of Legends</a> ".  Rock music was not <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/11370">spared</a> : there is an offer to release <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/13678">minifigures with rock stars</a> and a separate <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/11370">mat group</a> . <br><br>  Personally, I liked this <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/14605">project</a> . <br><br> <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/14605"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f62/163/9f4/f621639f438cf2e7a34510502d7444cf.jpg"></a> <br><br>  In the childhood in magazine "Do it yourself" I read about such a game.  Then more than once she met in Futurama, and then you can build it yourself, rebuild it, and still play with the children.  In April 2013, the project scored 10,000 votes and may be released. <br><code>&nbsp;</code><br><br><h2>  Will there be a Russian project? </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c14/53a/194/c1453a194d63cfe686e0a2c6fcfff1fd.jpg"><br><br>  Why not?  For example, we have a wonderful independent cultural product ‚Äú <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD-%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0!">Kin-Dza-Dza</a> ‚Äù, which can be implemented in the designer and supported by our community. <br><br>  Or any "Smeshariki" could become a designer.  True, there is such a thing as copyright, but the creators of the series themselves can act as initiators of the project. <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/DarkDenid/">DarkDenid</a> proposed designer with Yuri Gagarin.  I think this is a great idea!  Right now I'll start collecting and pushing a project. <br><br>  There are no obstacles.  There would be fans, desire and perseverance, and everything is possible. <br><code>&nbsp;</code><br><br><h2>  Project Criticism </h2><br> <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/8663"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3e0/f8e/a76/3e0f8ea76d745b72eaf1e1f1d70a4660.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Although the project‚Äôs exhaust is not high yet, there are only 3 designers, the project is good because it gives feedback.  Lego designers looking at the proposals may not take the project entirely, but some chips may push another idea. <br><br>  Nevertheless, it is noticeable that projects that ‚Äúlike‚Äù and not buy make their way upstairs.  I would suggest Cuusoo to try to connect Crowdsursing with Kraidfandding, so that users vote for the project not with likes, but with euros and dollars.  Because parting with hard-earned money, other assessment systems are included in the head and the picture may look more realistic. <br><br>  How to manage this money is already a technical question.  For example, Lego may not pay this money to the author of the project prior to launch, but pay off the prototype with the details.  Voters can not demand money back, but can return in the form of a discount on the designer, if he will be released. <br><br>  There is another moment.  The company so far uses only an individual mind, but not a collective one.  Now the company addresses to each individual project author: <br><br>  - Give us something! <br><br>  But it would be better to turn to the community, as a collective mind, so that the community would give an assessment and criticism, and would generate ideas.  Technically, this may look different, but there are mechanisms.  You can immediately suggest a topic: <br><br>  - How to implement in the designer Lego Tetris? <br><br>  The question is not trivial, there is no simple answer to it.  But this is what arouses creativity!  If there is already a whole community around the project, users will probably agree to play this game, and you don‚Äôt even have to promise prizes.  The process of participation in such creative contests is interesting. <br><br>  The project can be divided into stages: concept, main implementation, details.  And at each stage, listen to suggestions from the community and catch individual ideas.  I repeat, all this can be done without promises of royalty, here the value is not in money, but in involvement. <br><code>&nbsp;</code><br><br><h2>  A little about the history of the project </h2><br>  Initially, the platform for finding new ideas <a href="https://cuusoo.com/">Cuusoo</a> was created in Japan and resembles a crowdfunding kickstarter.  The difference is that there is no need to pay in advance.  Enough to vote. <br><br>  Lego has joined the domain lego.cuusoo.com, has released several designers and moved to its current location. <br><br><h2>  Authorship </h2><br>  Pictures from the <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/">official site</a> .  Except for one where patsak and chatlanin are made from minifigures.  I don‚Äôt know the author;  The text of <a href="http://vadimgalkin.pp.ru/">Vadim Galkin</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/154593/">https://habr.com/ru/post/154593/</a></p>
