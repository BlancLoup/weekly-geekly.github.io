      Recently, it has become increasingly common to talk about SIEM systems, especially since for certain companies and organizations, having their own SIEM system becomes not only relevant, but also a prerequisite. <br><br>  In order for the SIEM-system to provide the most extensive and complete information, it is necessary that as many devices, objects and applications as possible ‚Äúdeliver‚Äù the primary information to it.  It is clear that corporate antivirus is one of the main data providers here.  But how to integrate it with the SIEM system? <br><br>  Consider this question on the example of the cloud-based corporate antivirus Panda Adaptive Defense 360. In the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/panda/blog/312544/">first</a> part of the article, we considered the option of integrating the antivirus with its own simplified SIEM-system Advanced Reporting Tool.  In the second part of the article we will consider the situation when it is necessary to integrate an antivirus with a third-party SIEM system (the user already has his own SIEM system or plans to purchase a particular system). <br><br><h4>  <b>SIEMFeeder</b> </h4><br>  <b>What is SIEMFeeder</b> <br><br>  SIEMFeeder is a special service developed by Panda Security for transferring information and knowledge from the Adaptive Defense 360 ‚Äã‚Äãcorporate antivirus to a third-party SIEM platform. <br><br>  The main goal of this service is to enrich the corporate SIEM platform with detailed information on the activity of each process running on corporate computers.  As a result, the system administrator can get unprecedented visibility of everything that happens in the corporate network.  SIEMFeeder facilitates the detection of unknown threats, directed attacks to steal confidential corporate information, constant threats of increased complexity (APT). <br><br>  <b>SIEMFeeder architecture</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/80c/790/cec/80c790ceccbd454ba02ed9b48385c505.jpg"><br><br>  SIEMFeeder collects information about the activity of each application and the process running on the corporate network, thanks to continuous monitoring of the entire network by the corporate antivirus Adaptive Defense 360. This information in the cloud Panda platform with Big Data is automatically analyzed using artificial intelligence technologies to generate specialized security knowledge.  As a result, each process running on each computer in the enterprise‚Äôs network with an accuracy of about 99.999% and with almost zero false positives is classified.  After that, SIEMFeeder transfers all this information flow to the corporate SIEM server. <br><br>  Moreover, to get the most out of SIEMFeeder, there is no need to make any changes to the settings of the computers on the corporate network: the service runs inside the Panda Security infrastructure. <br><br>  The information flow is as follows: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Computers in the corporate network protected with <a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/russia/intelligence-platform/">Adaptive Defense 360</a> automatically send information about each running process to the Panda cloud <br>  ‚Ä¢ Cloud Panda accepts information, processes it and complements specialized security knowledge <br>  ‚Ä¢ The SIEMFeeder service receives information from the Panda cloud and encapsulates it in the form of logs, which are then transmitted to the user. <br>  ‚Ä¢ sFTP server in the corporate network receives logs from the SIEMFeeder for temporary storage with subsequent transfer to the SIEM server <br><br>  In addition, the architecture contains firewalls on the perimeter of the corporate network and locally on computers on the network to protect incoming and outgoing traffic. <br><br>  <b>Requirements for implementation and integration</b> <br><br>  In order to correctly implement the integration of a corporate antivirus with a SIEM-system within the framework of the considered example, it is necessary to consider the following requirements: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ implementation requirements <br>  ‚Ä¢ requirements for the SIEM system <br><br>  <b>Implementation requirements</b> <br><br>  To implement and use SIEMFeeder you need: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ computers on which Adaptive Defense 360 ‚Äã‚Äãcorporate security solution is installed <br>  ‚Ä¢ active license for SIEMFeeder <br>  ‚Ä¢ sFTP server <br>  ‚Ä¢ correctly configured firewall (built-in Adaptive Defense 360 ‚Äã‚Äãor third-party) <br>  ‚Ä¢ sufficient bandwidth to receive data <br><br>  <b>sFTP server</b> <br><br>  An sFTP server with the following characteristics must be installed on the corporate network: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ it must have enough storage space for information that comes from a SIEMFeeder.  Estimated volume: 2 MB from each computer per day <br>  ‚Ä¢ sFTP server must support up to 10 simultaneous connections with the same account <br>  ‚Ä¢ connect accounts with password-based authentication <br>  ‚Ä¢ the time after which the data connection is disconnected in the event that there is no data traffic: 20 minutes <br><br>  <b>Firewall setup</b> <br><br>  To establish a connection between the SIEMFeeder and the sFTP server, all intermediate firewalls must allow network traffic with the following characteristics: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ access via port 22 to sFTP server <br>  ‚Ä¢ access from the IP address 91.216.218.191 <br>  ‚Ä¢ transport protocol: TCP <br>  ‚Ä¢ application level protocol: SSH <br>  ‚Ä¢ Connection type: incoming traffic to the corporate network <br><br><h4>  <b>Requirements for the SIEM system</b> </h4><br>  <b>Supported SIEM systems</b> <br><br>  To be compatible with a SIEMFeeder, a SIEM system requires that it supports the following log formats: ArcSight Common Event Format (CEF) and QRadar Log Event Extended Format (LEEF). <br><br>  SIEMFeeder can send data in either of these two formats (CEF or LEEF).  Below is a limited list of SIEM servers that are compatible with the above formats (for example): <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ AlienVault Unified Security Management (USM) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Fortinet (AccelOps) FortiSIEM <br>  ‚Ä¢ Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) ArcSight <br>  ‚Ä¢ QRadar Security Intelligence Platform (IBM) <br>  ‚Ä¢ McAfee Enterprise Security Manager (ESM) (Intel Security) <br>  ‚Ä¢ LogRhythm <br>  ‚Ä¢ SolarWinds Log &amp; Event Manager (LEM) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Splunk Security Intelligence Platform <br><br>  <b>SIEM Server Configuration</b> <br><br>  In order to properly configure the SIEM server, you must import the sFTP server as a data source and correctly map the events and fields received from the SIEMFeeder (for more information about the data being transferred, see below). <br><br><h4>  <b>SIEMFeeder availability</b> </h4><br>  The SIEMFeeder service is available around the clock in 24/7 format.  Any possible breaks in the operation of this service will be previously reported to the administrator. <br><br>  In order to prevent data loss in the event of a failure, inaccessibility of the user's sFTP server or as a result of any other errors, Panda Security keeps logs generated by SIEMFeeder until they are transferred to the user (within a reasonable period of time). <br><br><h4>  <b>Transmitted events and data</b> </h4><br>  SIEMFeeder transforms information received from Adaptive Defense 360 ‚Äã‚Äãcorporate antivirus into events.  Thus, an event is the basic unit of information transmitted by the SIEMFeeder. <br><br><h4>  <b>Event structure in SIEMFeeder</b> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b4/4b4/6f0/2b44b46f00af4f1384c9df915ef73499.jpg"><br><br>  An event consists of a variable number of field-value pairs and one type / category of event.  Field-value pairs depend on the type of event. <br>  In addition, a preamble is added to the event with the information necessary to encapsulate the event into a CEF or LEEF compatible log file.  This information allows SIEM to correctly identify events in the form of compatible logs and include them in its repository. <br><br>  <b>Event group</b> <br><br>  The log file is a group of events transmitted to the SIEM server.  These log files generated by SIEMFeeder have different sizes and can contain one or more events belonging to different categories.  In addition, events included in a single log file may contain information from one or more user computers. <br><br>  <b>Sequences and delays in receiving information</b> <br><br>  The maximum amount of time that can pass from the moment when an event occurs on the user's computer, until the information about it is delivered to the SIEM system, is 20 minutes.  Adaptive Defense 360 ‚Äã‚Äãagents interact with the cloud every 10 minutes, after which the data is processed in the cloud and supplemented with specific security knowledge, transformed into a log file and sent using the SIEMFeeder to the user's SIEM system. <br><br>  SIEMFeeder does not send log files in a predetermined sequence.  However, all logs contain a time stamp, which allows the SIEM server to accurately "arrange" events on the timeline. <br><br>  <b>Format CEF-file SIEMFeeder</b> <br><br>  As we mentioned earlier, SIEMFeeder can send information in two formats: CEF or LEEF. <br><br>  The CEF format contains two data sections: a prefix or a preamble, which identifies an event category, and an extension section with fields and values.  At the same time, SIEMFeeder does not include the syslog header in the CEF logs.  Example: <br><br>  CEF: 1 | Panda Security | paps | 02.43.00.0000 | registryc | 1 | <br>  ClientId = Date = 2016-11-04 23: 47: 49.000087 MachineName = WIN-JNTIXXX MachineIP = xxx.219.203.xx User = NT svchost.exe ValidSig = Company = Microsoft Corporation Broken = true ImageType = EXE 64 ExeType = Unknown Prevalence = High PrevLastDay = Low HeurFI = 67108872 Skeptic = AVDets = 0 JIDFI = 3431976 1NFI = 132943 JIDMW = 11197481 1NMW = 5131976 1NMW = 5131976 = Goodware MWName = TargetPath = 0 | pune.com RegKey = \ REGISTRY \ MACHINE \ SYSTEM \ ControlSet001 \ services \ Tcpip \ Parameters? DhcpDomain <br><br>  <b>Prefix</b> <br><br>  CEF: 1 | Panda Security | paps | 02.43.00.0000 | registryc | 1 | <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>CEF version (CEF: 1)</b> : Identifier of the format and version of the log <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Device vendor (Panda Security)</b> : Service Provider Name <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Product (paps)</b> : Internal name of the software or device <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Signature ID (2.43.00.0000)</b> : The protection version that generates the event. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Name (registryc)</b> : Type of event sent. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Severity (1)</b> : Event severity.  This value is always ‚Äú1‚Äù, except for events with alert type (alertmalware, alertpup, exploits).  In more detail about the types of events we will say below. <br><br>  <b>Extensions</b> <br><br>  The extensions section contains various fields with different information depending on the <b>Name</b> field (event type). <br><br>  <b>Encoding</b> <br>  All log files sent by SIEMFeeder use UTF-8 encoding. <br><br><h4>  <b>Format of LEEF-file SIEMFeeder</b> </h4><br>  The LEEF format contains two data sections: a LEEF header that identifies an event category, and an attribute section that contains event information in the form of fields and values.  In this case, SIEMFeeder does not include the syslog header in the LEEF logs. <br><br>  Example: <br><br>  LEEF: 1.0 | Panda Security | paps | 02.43.00.0000 | registryc | sev = 1 devTime = 2016-09-22 15: 25: 11.000628 devTimeFormat = yyyy-MM-dd HH: mm: ss.SSS usrName = LOCAL SERVICE domain = NT AUTHORITY src = 10.219.202.149 identSrc = 10.219.202.149 identHostName = PXE68XXX HostName = PXE68XXX MUID = 1F109BA4E0XXXX37F9995D31FXXXX319 Op = CreateExeKey Hash = C78655BC80301D76ED4FEF1C1EA40A7D DriveType = Fixed Path = SYSTEM | \ svchost.exe ValidSig = Company = Microsoft Corporation Broken = true ImageType = EXE 64 ExeType = Unknown Prevalence = High PrevLastDay = Low HeurFI = 67108872 Skeptic = AVDets = 0 JIDFI = 3431993 1NFI = 116241 JIDMW = 11195630 1NMW = 4308325 Class = 100 Cat = Goodware MWName = TargetPath = 4.5, you need to have to set up to get to at a level, you have to set up to get a price, you can get MACHINE \ SYSTEM \ ControlSet001 \ services \ Tcpip \ Parameters? DhcpDomain <br><br>  <b>Headline</b> <br>  LEEF: 1.0 | Panda Security | paps | 02.43.00.0000 | registryc | <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>LEEF version (LEEF: 1)</b> : Log format and version identifier <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Vendor (Panda Security)</b> : The name of the service provider <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Product (paps)</b> : Internal name of the software or device <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Version ID (2.43.00.0000)</b> : The protection version that generates the event. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Event Description ID (registryc)</b> : Type of event sent <br><br>  In LEEF log files, the Severity event parameter is not passed in the header, but it is indicated in the section with attributes (the ‚ÄúSev = number‚Äù field) <br><br>  <b>Attributes section</b> <br><br>  The attributes section contains various fields with different information depending on the type of event. <br><br><h4>  <b>Event categories</b> </h4><br>  The type of event received is displayed in the <b>Name</b> field in the prefix section (CEF format), or in the <b>Event Description ID</b> field in the header (LEEF format). <br><br>  Below is a list of all possible events with explanations of their values, grouped by type: <br><br>  <b>Adaptive Defense 360 ‚Äã‚Äãagent deployment</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>install</b> : install agent <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>upgrade</b> : agent upgrade <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>uninstalll</b> : uninstall agent <br><br>  <b>Create alert</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>alertpup</b> : Alert created after detecting a potentially unwanted program (PNP) <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>alertmalware</b> : Alert created after detecting a malware sample. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>exploits</b> : Alert created after an exploit is detected. <br><br>  <b>Changes in the user's operating system</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>hostfiles</b> : The hosts file has been changed. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>monitoredregistry</b> : read access to the computer registry <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>registrym</b> : Modifying a branch in the registry to point to an executable file. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>registryc</b> : Creating a branch in the registry pointing to the executable file. <br><br>  <b>Processing process</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>createremotethread</b> : Created remote launch thread <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>createprocess</b> : process created <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>exec</b> : The process is complete. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>createpe</b> : Created executable program <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>modifype</b> : <b>Modified</b> executable file <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>renamepe</b> : Renamed executable file <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>deletepe</b> : <b>removed</b> executable program <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>loadlib</b> : Library loaded <br><br>  <b>File download</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>urldownload</b> : file downloaded <br><br>  <b>Data access</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>createcmp</b> : Archive file created <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>opencmp</b> : Archive file opened <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>monitoredopen</b> : Access monitored data files <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>createdir</b> : Created a folder in the file system <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>socket</b> : A network connection is established. <br><br>  <b>Blocking information</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>toast</b> : Adaptive Defense showed a pop-up message. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>notBlocked</b> : The corresponding file was not scanned during the download. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>toastBlocked</b> : Active Defense showed a pop-up message after blocking an unknown file <br><br><h4>  <b>Event structure and field syntax</b> </h4><br>  SIEMFeeder describes each event dispatched using a field-value pair.  Events in SIEMFeeder are divided into two types: active events and passive events. <br><br>  <b>Internal structure of active events</b> <br><br>  Most events that are received describe the situations in which the parent process performs an action on a child process.  The type of item that receives the action varies depending on the category of the event.  Thus, as a child element can be: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Another process</b> : In events where a process is downloaded / loaded, a library is loaded, etc. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Executable file</b> : In events where a program is created, modified, deleted <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>System file</b> : In events where manipulations are performed with the hosts file, the registry <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Data file</b> : In events where you can access Office files, databases, etc. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Download file</b> : In events where the process downloads data <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Archived file</b> : In events where an archived file is created, modified, deleted <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Folder</b> : In events where a folder is created, modified, deleted <br><br>  Depending on its type, the event will or will not contain certain fields describing the characteristics of the parent and child elements.  For example, if the event type is associated with the creation of a folder, the fields associated with the event will describe the characteristics of the parent process (malware or not, the process path, the process meta-data, etc.), as well as the characteristics of the child process.  However, in this case, since we are dealing with a folder, some event fields will be empty. <br><br>  <b>Internal structure of passive events</b> <br><br>  We are talking about events that in most cases do not have a clearly defined parent or child process.  Passive events, for example, include generating alerts when a malicious program is detected, or installing / modifying / removing the Adaptive Defense 360 ‚Äã‚Äãagent. <br><br>  <b>Parent and child prefixes</b> <br><br>  Active processes, including two files or processes, show the prefixes Parent and Child to show which information belongs to which process: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Parent</b> : Fields starting with the Parent tag describe the attribute of the parent process. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Child</b> : Fields starting with the Child tag describe an attribute of the child process <br><br>  <b>Other prefixes and affixes</b> <br><br>  Many fields and values ‚Äã‚Äãuse abbreviations.  Knowing their meaning, it is much easier to interpret the field in question: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Sig</b> : Digital Signature <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Exe and pe</b> : Executable file <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Mw</b> : Malware <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Sec</b> : Seconds <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Op</b> : Operation <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Cat</b> : Category <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>PUP</b> : Potentially unwanted program <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Ver</b> : Version <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>SP</b> :

</h4><br>  Adaptive Defense 360 ‚Äã‚Äãis able to automatically and almost in real time to transfer to a third-party SIEM system a huge amount of information about all the processes monitored on computers in the corporate network.  In turn, the SIEM-system allows you to instantly provide the processed expert information in a digestible form, so that the user can make effective decisions to counter malicious and unauthorized actions, minimize security risks and prevent leakage of corporate data.  In addition, SIEM systems can be used to thoroughly investigate information security incidents to determine what, where, when, how and with whom it happened. <br><br>  However, even if the enterprise already has a corporate antivirus, then a separate Adaptive Defense product can be used as a ‚Äúcollector‚Äù of a huge amount of primary information with its subsequent automatic upload to SIEM without affecting the performance of computers.  Given that Adaptive Defense will be extremely useful as a ‚Äúdefender‚Äù against unknown threats, targeted attacks and cryptographers, working in parallel with the existing corporate antivirus. <br><br>  In the huge flow of information it is difficult to quickly record and track everything that is needed.  And in this regard, the integration of corporate antivirus with a SIEM system can be a great help. <br><br>  <b>We offer to evaluate the capabilities of <a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/russia/intelligence-platform/">Adaptive Defense 360</a></b> using a demo console (without the need to install the product). <br><br>  The demo console is designed to demonstrate Panda Adaptive Defense 360, which already has certain information on user settings, profiles, etc., which allows you to evaluate the console in a mode as close as possible to real work. <br><br>  Access to the demo console: <a href="http://demologin.pandasecurity.com/">demologin.pandasecurity.com</a> <br>  Login: DRUSSIAN_FEDERATION_C13@panda.com <br>  Password: DRUSSIAN # 123 <br><br>  <i>Note: Reset changes in the settings of products that are made when viewing the demo console, occurs daily.</i> <i><br></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/323536/">https://habr.com/ru/post/323536/</a></p>
