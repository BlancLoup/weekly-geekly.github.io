  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fat = sick! Or how to lose weight</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Geektimes is a resource for IT specialists.  Long sitting at the computer (that is, a sedentary lifestyle) snacking, piecemeal, fast food, on-the-job dinners and other satellites of such a lifestyle often lead to excess weight.  Because of my gender, this problem may worry me more than males, so I figured out something for myself.  I want to share my knowledge and experience with others.  I do not pretend to the truth, I do not have medical education.  Not criticism, but useful advice is welcomed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  An important addition - there are diseases (most often associated with hormonal disruptions in the body), in which you will not be able to lose weight with proper nutrition and sports.  In this case, let one - to the doctor and the sooner the better - these are very dangerous diseases. <br><habracut><br>  To begin, I will explain why the <b>fat = sick</b> .  Overweight people are the first on the way to diabetes, hypertension (and it leads to heart attacks and strokes - "leaders" among the causes of death), diseases of the musculoskeletal system (muscles do not develop, and the load on the bones due to the large weight only grows ).  Often food seizes stress, then gets upset looking at himself in the mirror, again seizes this disorder, and so on in a circle.  Often, overweight people do not like themselves - and this is psychological problems. <br><br>  <b><u>How to understand is overweight or not?</u></b> <br>  The most common ‚Äúhomemade‚Äù methods are the calculation of body mass index (BMI) = body weight in kg / (height in meters) <sup>2</sup> <br>  For example, my BMI is 50 / 1.62 * 1.62 = 19 <br>  Norm - from 18.5 to 25 (very average).  In my opinion, girls with an index of 24-25 are overweight, but this does not affect the health critically. <br>  The second method - many conventional scales consider% body fat.  Doctors in fitness centers (that is, not a guru of dietology and all that) consider him in simple programs like <a href="http://medintelsys.com/CORVID/corvidsr%3FKBNAME%3D../wecrus.cvR%26Charset%3DCp1251">this (link taken from Wikipedia)</a> .  Specifically, about this link - the indicators of calories for a person there are some too cruel, I would not focus on them. <br><br>  <b><u>What happens in the body, where does fat come from?</u></b> <br>  In the body there are 2 processes - lipolysis (the breakdown of fats) and lipogenesis (their accumulation).  How to "turn on" lipogenesis?  Simply simple - eat a cake (sweet + fat), eat Big Mac and wash down with cola (the same).  There is a lot of insulin in the blood (because of sugar) and a lot of fatty acids.  + 10-15 grams of fat on the tummy.  This is the simplest example, there are others, but in principle, there is enough knowledge that fat + sugar (or other simple carbohydrates - those that are absorbed quickly) gives a 100% weight gain.

      For stability (i.e., weight retention), it is necessary to avoid sudden surges in blood sugar, eat slow carbohydrates, do not drink big mams with cola.  But for weight loss is not enough. <br><br>  <b><u>What are some ways to lose weight?</u></b> <br>  First, it is <b>fasting</b> .  Perhaps only under the supervision of a doctor, because your body simply slows down the metabolism utterly, which is fraught with a huge number of possible adverse effects.  Yes, there are examples when people from 200 kg dumped to 120 kg while starving, but (in my opinion) if you have less than 50 kg of excess weight, you should not even think about it.  And if you consume less than the basic calories per day (about 700-900 for women, 1000-1200 for men) - you are starving! <br><br>  It is also known from the school biology course that our body can make fat from proteins and carbohydrates (which is why special lovers of hard mono-diets can gain weight from lettuce), but from fat it cannot do anything.  Or leave as is or spend on energy.  1 g fat = 8-9 calories.  10 kg of fat - 85,000 kcal, divide by 30 days (in a month) - 2833 kcal per day.  Every day it is aerobic exercise for 4-5 hours (which is unrealistic for a complete and unprepared person). <br><br>  Secondly, <b>physical activity</b> .  It's all pretty simple.  Muscles are made up of fibers that contract.  To reduce them, energy is needed, energy is taken from the ATP molecule, the body needs glucose to replenish its ATP stock (glycogen is a chain of glucose molecules).  What we need is for the body to get glucose by the oxidation process (there are other faster, but not relevant processes to us), which is why the load must be <b>aerobic</b> .  And oxidation is a rather long process (that is why it is said that fat is ‚Äúburned‚Äù after 30 minutes of jogging or another type of load).  That is why you will not lose weight from a barbell with a jerk, and yes from a bicycle ride.  The logical conclusion - in order to lose weight you need to load the muscles, but at the same time adhere to certain rules of nutrition. <br><br>  In the ways of weight loss diets, I do not mention, since mono diets (10 days on kefir / buckwheat / rice) - this is starvation and violence over the body, and I want to consider diets as images of food later.  About what, how, how much and when to eat, as well as how to load myself physically I want to talk in the following sections.  If the topic is interesting, I can tell you about some tricks for losing weight. </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/70898/">https://habr.com/ru/post/70898/</a></p>
