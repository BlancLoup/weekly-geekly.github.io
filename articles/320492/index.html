But finding the right people who were highly qualified specialists, could work effectively as a team, and shared your values ‚Äã‚Äãand goals, is not always easy.  Plarium has gone from a small studio to a large company and knows how to attract the right people.  In this article, Plarium HR specialists will share tips on effective staff selection for various vacancies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/791/64c/a4e/79164ca4ecdb4240bdde6d56ddca5241.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Usually, when a company is born, little attention is paid to recruitment.  A startup is basically a group of enthusiasts who believe that their product will become commercially successful.  In this case, the founders of the company appeal to friends who can help in solving certain issues.  By the time when the number of employees of the company reaches at least thirty people, a smooth transition to the organization of staff recruitment and transfer of this function to outsourcing to a recruiting company or HR freelancers should begin. <br><br>  After increasing the staff of the company to up to one hundred people, its founders find it difficult to devote time to recruiting and adapting newcomers, since management focuses on strategic objectives: product improvement, search for new sales markets and marketing.  At this time, it is impractical to completely outsource the selection of personnel to outsourcing.  The use of freelance recruiters is not prohibited, but it is better to have your own personnel manager, who will study the work of the organization in detail and know what personal and professional requirements are for applicants in each department or team.  The third-party recruiter may find specialists with relevant work experience, but since he does not understand all the features of the company, its organizational structure and corporate culture, it is difficult for him to figure out how competent future employees are, how they will fit in with the team and whether their work will be effective.

      With a company of up to one hundred people, one HR manager can work.  As for companies with more than one hundred employees, then you need to think about creating a personnel management team and assign specific departments to each HR specialist. <br><br>  Sometimes situations arise when the company‚Äôs activity expands dramatically, with the result that the task appears to quickly fill the shortage of personnel.  On average, one HR-manager closes five-seven vacancies of IT-specialists per month, and, unfortunately, no matter how much you want, it will not be possible to recruit a large number of highly qualified employees without assistance in a short time.  In this case, management should decide how to distribute existing employees in the existing areas while searching for new ones. <br><br><h3>  Ways to find staff </h3><br>  To search for staff using various methods.  Most often this is a vacancy announcement on various sites and social networks.  However, this method is ineffective: there are many responses, but potential candidates, as a rule, do not have the necessary experience and skills for the position.  With the help of ads alone, it is impossible to find specialists who from the first months of work will be useful to the company. <br><br>  Professionals feel comfortable in their workplaces, where they are ‚Äúblown away dust particles‚Äù, motivated and encouraged in every possible way, so they will not leave their positions for no apparent reason.  To attract highly qualified personnel, well-known headhunting is used.  Recruiters find candidate contacts through various online resources: specialized forums, social and professional networks, for example, VKontakte, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Vimeo and YouTube video hosting sites, personal blogs and publications.  Then HR managers contact the person and try to interest him.  You can lure an experienced specialist with an interesting project or with a new technology that he would like to study, provided that this is not foreseen at the current place of work.  It is also possible that a person thinks about a change in the sphere of activity, for example, from the banking industry to game devs.  If the candidate has been able to be interested, he is contacted with the head of the department to discuss the nuances of possible cooperation.  Next, a person is given a test task to evaluate his skills in practice.  After successful completion of the test task, an interview is scheduled.  If at this stage it is possible to reach a general agreement, then a decision is taken on cooperation. <br><br><h3>  Resume analysis </h3><br>  One of the important steps in the work of an HR specialist is the consideration of a resume.  By summary, you can make certain conclusions about applicants for a particular position.  First of all, note how the person‚Äôs past experience corresponds to the area in which your company works.  In the case of Plarium, we look to see if the applicant worked in the game development company.  If yes, then this is definitely a plus - the higher the requirements for a job, the more significant this plus. <br><br>  It is also worth mentioning that jumping experience in a resume is a repulsive factor for an HR manager.  In our studio, 80% of such resumes are cut off.  Agree, if a person has changed several companies within a year, then this causes suspicion.  Obviously, he can not consolidate in one place and work effectively in a team.  Most likely, this is an unreliable specialist, who has no desire to learn the nuances of his profession and to understand the principles of the company.  However, there are always exceptions.  For recent students and university graduates, the presence of such experience is better than its absence. <br><br>  Making a resume also says a lot about a person: people of creative professions make it more freely, and technical specialists - clearly and succinctly.  If the job requires a high level of literacy and care from the performer, for example, for a copywriter or editorial post, then resume errors are unacceptable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/104/328/1f0/1043281f011242c8a81afce4d2814a9a.jpg"><br><br>  Some positions are suitable for people without work experience.  For example, even a young specialist, for whom there are no special requirements, can be invited to the office manager position: you just need to be careful, accurate and stress-resistant. <br><br>  Sometimes there are resumes in which the specified work experience only partially meets the requirements.  Even before the interview, such candidates are given a test task in order to test their practical skills and see if they will cope with their upcoming duties.  After correctly performing the test, they are invited for an interview. <br><br>  Living in the information age, do not neglect the opportunity to test human behavior for overall adequacy in social networks.  Explore his personal page, see posts, subscriptions and photos.  One should be wary if a person is aggressive in political judgments, shows acute religious intolerance or actively supports the ideas of nationalists.  In a large collective, such categoricalness can lead to conflicts. <br><br><h3>  Interviewing </h3><br>  After analyzing the resume and test assignment, an interview is held in which it is advisable to combine elements of a stressful interview and a comfortable conversation.  The type of interview depends on which department they are going to invite the person to.  If the work is connected with people (in our company it is a technical support department), then steel nerves are important, the ability to abstract from possible insults to users, quickly switch from one task to another.  Such a candidate should be checked in a stressful situation, for example, to conduct interviews with a large number of people.  You can use the method of ‚ÄúGood and bad policeman‚Äù, where most often the personnel manager plays the role of a positive hero, who seeks to provide a comfortable environment, and the future immediate manager asks tricky work questions, tries to put a person off balance to assess how he leads yourself in a tense setting.  Ask the candidate what he would do in a particular case.  For example, a product update is planned and for this it is necessary to complete a task for which two hours are allocated, but, having begun work, he understands that it will take twenty hours.  Update is not possible to postpone.  What will be his actions? <br><br>  To check whether the applicant is competent in his field, you can ask the same question, changing its wording.  If the answers differ significantly among themselves, then most likely the person lies about his skills and experience. <br><br>  It is not necessary during the interview to follow a specific list of questions.  It is better to focus on the human reaction: if he is tense, then create a comfortable environment, and if you are confident in yourself, add a little pressure. <br><br>  Of course, the personnel manager must take into account the requirements of the head of the department in which they are looking for employees.  It is necessary to pay attention not only to professional skills, but also to personal characteristics.  The same quality of a candidate can be a plus for one position and a minus for another.  For example, creative thinking is necessary for artists who create the visual part of the game.  At the same time, this quality is not necessary for content managers, it is much more important for them to be attentive to details and to be able to work with large volumes of information. <br><br>  If a person does not meet the requirements of one vacancy, his candidacy can be considered for another.  You should also save a summary of all candidates in the database, because they can be useful in the future. <br><br><h3>  The organization of the trial period </h3><br>  A specialist who successfully passed the interview is invited for a trial period.  At first, the employee studies and receives the necessary information to achieve the goals set for him.  Depending on the nature of the position occupied, the period of training for effective work in the company may take a week or a month.  If a person copes with all the tasks, then the contract with him is extended. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c38/3a6/511/c383a6511af34aea9c198342806b448c.jpg"><br><br>  Some candidate errors cannot be ignored under any circumstances.  In companies with established internal processes and a built-in system of interaction, the appearance of a person who breaks these processes or divulges confidential information is unacceptable.  It is important that the candidate become part of the team and accept the general ‚Äúrules of the game‚Äù of the team. <br><br>  During the probationary period, the manager, who is directly involved in the adaptation and entry of the person into the position, is obliged to inform him of the quality of the work done by him.  An employee needs to receive an objective assessment of his activity: what knowledge is important to have and in which areas he needs to improve. <br><br>  According to the results of the probationary period, the head provides the HR department with a review of the work of the new employee, containing all the positive and negative points.  If the applicant did not pass the probationary period, then it would be nice to tell him what skills he should develop and master.  If successful, the new employee is provided with information indicating the necessary skills through which he will be able to get up the career ladder.  It is important to understand that a probationary period is a mutual process between an employee and a company.  If at least one of the parties treats it in bad faith, then to establish an effective interaction will not work. <br><br>  Each firm builds a job of finding personnel, focusing on their preferences and requirements, but there is a point that is common to any areas of activity: organizations are interested in attracting competent employees.  We are confident that if we carry out quality work at all stages of the selection of candidates, the chances of finding real professionals will increase many times.  It must be remembered that people are the main asset of the organization, and the mission of the HR department is to bring together the best under one roof to achieve common goals. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/320492/">https://habr.com/ru/post/320492/</a></p>
