  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New book on Cortex-M0 / M0 +</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  AWP has sold over 200 licenses for Cortex-M cores, and thousands of these devices are on the market.  Although the company created the M7 core last year, which offers incredible performance for the MCU, the initial level of the core line continues to be of great interest to manufacturers.  The implementation of the M0 core requires about 12,000 gates (it‚Äôs hard to say if we are talking about gates or basic elements, in any case this is a little, but in the first ‚Äî much less ‚Äî the translator‚Äôs note), so it costs a little more than nothing (the implementation, of course, and not a license, by the way, if anyone knows the prices - share in the comments - nn).  M0 + has the same set of instructions (as M0-pp), but shows better performance with low power consumption for battery-powered devices, plus advanced (optional) debugging capabilities, and even an additional memory protection unit (MMU for the poor). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  (The following is ... translation of the description of the book describing processors - which is a derivative of iron, the third? - nn). <br>  Joseph Yu wrote a new book about these two processors.  "The complete guide to the ARM Cortex-M0 and Cortex-M0 + processors" complements its early volume on the M3.  Given the size of 746 pages, I must agree that this is indeed an exhaustive and undoubtedly ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù work on these cores.  The author of the book works on ARM, and some parts of the first two chapters can be viewed as company advertisements, although they also contain a lot of valuable information. <br><br>  The book is very relevant, as it covers issues related to obtaining high EEMBC (performance indicators - PP) at ultra-low supply voltages.  I wrote about this in March and for those of us who work with battery-powered systems, it‚Äôs worth seeing what values ‚Äã‚Äãthis indicator can be raised to.  The chapter covers low-powered features, but you have to study the documentation of the products you use in depth, as licensees sometimes add to the number of their own functions to minimize the consumption of pendants. <br><br>  The audience of the book is somewhat blurred.  I would argue that it consists of practicing engineers, since the book contains all the details necessary for implementation.  But it has a whole chapter dedicated to explaining the basics of embedded software development that readers of this site can skip.  This section of the book contains an introduction to the CMSIS library, an important resource for Cortex-M users, but we already know everything about dumping, data types, and other basics of our business.

      As in his earlier book, Mr. Yu does a good job describing the architecture of both microcontrollers and bus devices.  If you use, or are considering such devices, then this information is absolutely necessary for you.  ARM cores are complex, contain many buses, pipelines of variable length, various orders of bytes in memory, and other features that can cause confusion. <br><br>  The best part of the book is four chapters on getting started writing code.  Each covers one environment from Keil, IAR, GCC and mbed.  Choose the appropriate tool (let's start hollivar? - pp), go to the appropriate chapter, and Mr. Yu will help you quickly complete the environment setup and write your first code for Cortex-M0 / M0 +.  He also provides some specific advice for Freescale (FRDM) and ST (STM32) products.  Your boss must pay for this book. <br><br>  One section describes in detail the transfer of code from different processors (for example, 8051) to M0 / M0 +.  This will undoubtedly baffle sellers of other types of processors!  But basically this section describes in detail the transfer of code from more complex, ARM cores to entry-level cores, a process that has certain features.  These recommendations are very useful. <br><br>  The style of the author is clear and typography is not fancy.  One pun, which is perhaps more similar to a complaint about the state of the modern publishing industry: there is not a single sheet indicating the participation of the editor.  Once upon a time (in one galaxy - nn) there were such people who were masters of the English language, who found obvious language errors and corrected them.  (Well, it's just grammatical errors, it's still a garbage. But when you read a published book - translation of technical literature, and the Bode diagrams are transferred with an offset, and you just can not understand what a strange break in the frequency response, this is really unpleasant. Or when calculating thermal resistance, a comma is omitted, 62 is written instead of 0.62, and suddenly the thermal resistance of the system increases when the radiator is installed, so it can carry the brain. Those who are in the subject learned the book. - long paragraph) This book contains many grammatical errors.  Example: ‚ÄúEasy to learning programming of new devices‚Äù (probably, it‚Äôs really a mistake here, but not with my knowledge of English, to find it, so I take a word for Jack).  They distract, but do not reduce the merits concerning technical content. <br><br>  The book costs $ 62 on Amazon, or $ 34 for the Kindle version (probably the electronic version is nn).  To give as much as 62 bucks for a book is a very funny offer for today's state of affairs (they have a crisis there too? It seemed to me that 62 bucks there and here are slightly different bucks - nn).  But if you are new to these kernels, crush your toad and buy a book.  She will give you an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe necessary things for real projects. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/273877/">https://habr.com/ru/post/273877/</a></p>
