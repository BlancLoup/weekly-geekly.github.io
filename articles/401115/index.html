Here we have touched models of both classic acoustics and portable models, embedded systems and speakers. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/553/8e5/752/5538e5752f744b2eb59704d5b0b65b20.png" width="400"></div><br>  <i>/ Bookshelf acoustics <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/polochnaya_akustika/old_school/old_school_studio_monitor_m2.html">Old School Studio Monitor M2</a></i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Brand <a href="http://oldschoolaudio.ru/">Old School</a> was created specifically for those who want to return to the past, but at the same time get a modern sound quality.  It all started with the Arslab Old School Superb 90 column, which externally resembled the classic <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/blog/248764/">S-90</a> model, but with a completely different element base. <br><br>  There were many who wanted to return to the past not only in Russia, so soon the acoustics of Old School turned into a separate brand, and the line of unusual audio solutions was replenished with several more interesting models.  Today, products are available in Europe, Asia and the Russian market, and the brand‚Äôs own production is in Latvia.
