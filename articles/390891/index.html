This ransomware infiltrated the school‚Äôs computer network last week, hitting the 25 servers that stored all the information about the students.  Immediately after this happened, the staff of the institution shut down all the servers to prevent further spread of the virus.  Naturally, school services stopped working. <br><br>  The cryptographer requested 0.8 bitcoins from the computer, it turned out exactly 20 bitcoins.  School representatives said the virus had penetrated the old server with outdated software and hardware.  A complaint was filed with the FBI, but, like in all similar cases, the Bureau could do little to help. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After the IT specialists, who were called upon to help, could not do anything, the school administration decided to pay.  And on February 15, the payment went to the attackers.  Local newspapers also reported problems when making a payment, because the school first had to look for a way to convert dollars into bitcoins, with all costs indicated in the standard documents. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Almost immediately after the payment, the administration received a key to decrypt the files, and was able to restore all services and files.  Even before the network became infected with a cryptographer, the school began to look for a company that could protect the institution‚Äôs network.  As you can see, the administration failed to find protection on time. <br><br>  I recall that recently, one of the hospitals in Hollywood <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/271162/">had to pay</a> $ 17,000 to developers of similar software, since ransomware completely blocked the work of the institution‚Äôs network.  The encryption virus that infected the institution‚Äôs computer network encrypted all files on infected PCs, and the key that allows decrypting the files is known only to hackers. <br><br>  Attackers who create this kind of ransomware do not always send the keys after the victim makes a payment.  But in this case everything worked out, and the work of the school network and services is now proceeding as before. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390891/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390891/</a></p>
