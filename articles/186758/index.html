  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Experience of entering the ‚Äúbusy‚Äù market of regional real estate portals</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The idea to write about how we decided to create "one more real estate site" in our region arose after reading <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/184334/">this topic</a> .  But below will be considered not so much the technical part (although there may be questions about it, and readers can voice them in the comments - the answers will be) as many ideological moments that helped us to do not just ‚Äúanother site about real estate‚Äù, but something useful. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Position before the start </h4><br>  It is clear that in order to break into an already occupied glade (3 large portals with attendance from 1 thousand to 5 thousand people a day and a base of offers in more than 13 thousand objects), it was necessary to find something that no one has, and as if to eat us.  After a <s>year of contemplation of the dark energy of the Universe in the lotus position of</s> some thoughts, the thought came: we have new buildings in the city, and information on them is presented: <br><br>  a).  On the plates near the construction sites. <br>  b).  On the sites of developers. <br>  at).  On the pages of advertising newspapers. <br>  d).  Partly from real estate agencies. <br>  d).  Sometimes nowhere.

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Looking at the list, it became clear that the scattered, uninformative and poorly presented information on the Internet seems to hint to us: we need to present all the new buildings in one place and place <b>special emphasis on this</b> .  After it became clear where to start - everything began to turn ... <br><br><h4>  Debut. </h4><br>  We were divided into two groups: techies and ideologues, ideologues ran and collected information about new buildings, techies did not run, but they also moved. <br><br>  Actually the block of information about new buildings did not contain anything technologically interesting in the implementation.  Three tables with a one-to-many ratio plus an output interface.  Boredom.  But I <b>managed to</b> implement it and release <b>it in a short time</b> .  To our surprise, we soon (after 3-8 weeks) received information from developers who, including  before that <b>they were not presented on the Internet</b> , that calls were sent to them with reference to our website.  This fact inspired us, it became clear that the defense in the sector of the market <s>front was</s> broken through and into this breakthrough, after intelligence, about which we have rushed below. <br><br><h4>  Mittelspiel. </h4><br>  In order to build on success, analysis of local competitors and similar services in capitals was carried out.  The analysis showed that metropolitan services, by and large, look more solid, more thorough and more laborious in execution, so it was decided to borrow from them <b>only some of the most interesting elements</b> (search on the map and similar amenities). <br><br>  Local resources performed by seemed simpler, so they decided to compete with the convenience of metropolitan sites, <b>eliminating the inconvenience that competitors have</b> , linking to the base of new buildings and price: we <b>decided to provide the</b> basic functionality (creating an arbitrary number of ads with photos) <b>to everyone</b> : and realtors, and private owners.  And, as written on Facebook, ‚ÄúIt's free and always will be free.‚Äù <br><br>  After the strategic directions of the breakthrough were identified, the question became about the benefits that the portal user (buyer) needs to give and the inconveniences that need to be taken from him. <br><br>  The list of differences from the ‚Äú <b>standard regional set</b> ‚Äù turned out to be short: <br><br>  1. <b>Remove duplicates</b> who host many agencies, incl.  mimic under the owner, thoroughly littering the issue.  We decided to do this as follows, if the server decides that this is a duplicate ad, then it shows in the list only that which is the most profitable at the price.  And he writes that "5 more similar ads you want to see." <br>  2. <b>Remove the price of the object "negotiable"</b> .  They thought - ‚Äúwhat kind of eroticism?‚Äù Because the hedgehog is clear that there is an object, in the conditions of housing shortage the price is dictated mainly by the seller - so name the price, and the ‚Äútop price‚Äù is only palpable. <br>  3. Also, we <b>did not give the opportunity to place ads with the price per square meter</b> - this is generally an incomprehensible entity, so why indicate N thousands per square if the whole apartment is for sale? <br>  4. To give the <b>opportunity to place a 3d tour</b> of the apartment or video - so as not to go far, but to watch the apartment, without leaving the chair directly. <br>  5. <b>Search on the map in a given area</b> with expandable settings - very important for those users who want to search in a particular area. <br><br>  With the technical implementation of the ads, I had to work longer: it was necessary to pull <a href="http://api.yandex.ru/maps/">API cards from Yandex</a> , to come up with similarity criteria, to outline the function of converting minutes of latitude to kilometers, depending on this same latitude, to <s>screw up <a href="http://hybridauth.sourceforge.net/">Hybrid Auth</a> with plug-ins to</s> configure authorization via <a href="http://ulogin.ru/">uLogin</a> (by the way, thanks to them very much). <br><br>  Ideologists <b>immediately ran through agencies</b> , telling us that everything was the same, only better and cheaper.  It is interesting, but it seemed suspicious to the agencies that they don‚Äôt take money for basic functionality and some innovations didn‚Äôt seem as useful as it seemed to us, but we didn‚Äôt return duplicates and the definition of apartment price per square meter.  m <br><br><h4>  Endgame </h4><br>  Now our database contains more than 1000 ads in the capital of the region.  And its growth is limited so far only to some apprehensive agencies: they do not believe that it will always be free of charge (and this is so), and they think that while the resource is too young, it will pass with time. <br><br>  That's actually all that I would like to briefly say about what actions had to be taken to make "another site about real estate" and not to go unnoticed. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> If the habosoobshchestvo have questions, ask - answer. <br><br>  <b>PSS</b> Well, yes, the result of the works: <a href="http://novostroy29.ru/">another site about real estate</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/186758/">https://habr.com/ru/post/186758/</a></p>
