  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Escape from the ‚ÄúOthers‚Äù column: local brands increase market share</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Three months ago, I talked about the situation with local Russian electronics trademarks and their market shares in the post <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/190534/">‚ÄúOther‚Äù column: about budget smartphones and local brands</a> .  In it, I remind you, it was about the fact that domestic companies engaged in the supply of inexpensive Android-backgrounds from Asia are beginning to crowd in the so-called global brands in Russia. <br><br>  And now, towards the end of the year, there is new evidence that these very global brands are really losing market share under the pressure of Russians.  The newspaper "Vedomosti" published an interesting <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/tech/news/18612401/%2520rossijskie-brendy-smartfonov-naraschivayut-dolyu-rynka%3Ffull">article</a> , which deals with a report on the domestic smartphone market from the marketing research institute Gfk for the first 9 months of 2013.  Point number one: if you believe the report of the specified office, the total share of the market leaders of "smart phones" - Samsung, Apple and Nokia - for the specified period fell to 52.6% (almost a third).  For comparison: in the first 9 months of 2012, it reached 70%. <br><br>  As for the notorious column ‚ÄúOthers‚Äù, combining dozens of brands with scanty shares, we managed to break out of it - and at the same time get some positions in the chart (see below) - to four local brands.  These are Explay, Megafon, Highscreen and MTS.  The first three brands, according to Gfk, today together occupy about 6% of the smartphone market.

Here it is worth noting that the first is present on the smartphone market only from mid-2012, and the second seriously took up this trend only in 2013 - hence this rapid growth (they grew almost from scratch).  According to the calculations of the same Gfk, for the first 9 months of 2012, Explay and MegaFon for two had 0.5% of the market, and now - 2.4 and 2.6, respectively. <br><br>  As for Highscreen, Gfk experts recorded a fivefold increase in sales of smartphones of this brand, which led to an increase in market share from 0.5 to 1.1 percent, which is equivalent to 147 thousand devices.  However, referring to the source Vedomosti, which is close to Highscreen, they write that in fact, Highscreen in the first 9 months of 2013 was able to sell 350 thousand devices.  And this is not 1.1, but 2.5 percent.  Where the truth is God knows, but the fact remains: Highscreen smartphones disperse hundreds of thousands of pieces across Russia - and this is without much support from Svyaznoy and branded operator shops, as in the cases of Explay and MegaFon, respectively. <br><br>  During the first 9 months of 2013, sales of MTS smartphones increased 4 times, so this brand has 2.1% of the market today.  Escape from the ‚ÄúOthers‚Äù, in other words, is also fixed. <br><br>  Almost all the experts polled by Vedomosti tend to believe that the reason for the explosive growth of local brands lies in their activity in the budget segment.  First-line brands are not able to offer solutions priced at up to 10 thousand rubles with imputed characteristics, while B-brands are happy to do this.  (Some information on this topic is in the post <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/196626/">‚ÄúMediaTek and Samsung: the possibility of cooperation and interesting consequences,‚Äù</a> where I compared budget smartphones with quad-core processors from Highscreen and Samsung.) <br><br>  In the future, however, local brands will also have a hard time.  Let us recall electronic readers: one day, a year in 2011, literally EVERYTHING began to be carried.  There were hundreds of models from dozens of brands on the market.  Now there are only a few left.  Yes, the point here is not only that the strongest survive, but also that the demand for reading rooms has fallen markedly under the pressure of the tablets.  However, the second does not negate the first reason - and the situation with smartphones is exactly the same: some local brands will ‚Äúdie‚Äù in the future, a significant part of B-brands will move to the lowest segment and offer ultra-budgetary ones of the same type, and only those who will invest in the design and unique pieces of devices.  Without forgetting about the imputed price tags. <br><br>  What do you think, dear habrove?  Does it make sense to buy devices from B-brands or is it worth contacting them as a last resort.  I now understand with brains that their products have already grown to an acceptable level, but the soul does not yet lie to such devices. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/202924/">https://habr.com/ru/post/202924/</a></p>
