As a result, advertising efficiency increased by 10-20%.  The article is a great comment from BBDO, why native advertising needs b2c. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Viktoria Generalova, Senior Digital Manager Digital BBDO, tells about the preparation and results of the Rostelecom campaign.

    <h2>  What problems and obstacles do b2c brands face when they want to advertise in the media and why do they need native advertising? </h2><br>  The problems of the b2c sector are directly related to the consumer.  His view is blurred, competition in the b2c segment is extremely high.  Therefore, advertisers constantly need to look for all new approaches to their customers in order to get into their desires and make their proposal as relevant as possible. <br><br>  The domestic user is becoming more and more savvy and educated on the part of the Internet, and begins to easily filter the content imposed on him.  The solution in this situation is a competent symbiosis of the native format and the advertising communicative message integrated into it. <br><br>  Native formats allow you to use behavioral targeting for keywords, which also increases the chances of displaying the relevant message. <br><br>  A growing pool of clients is ready to consider the native format on a regular basis.  Seeing the actual quality indicators, customers want to increase volumes. <br><br><h2>  Promotion of Rostelecom services using native Relap advertising </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/180/eaa/885/180eaa885866b467d00661b3dd02c770.png" alt="image"><br>  <em>Campaign example</em> <br><br><h2>  Tasks </h2><br>  In conjunction with the main objectives of building the image and knowledge of the brand, as well as its key products, we are faced with the task of increasing the client base of the client, which is expressed in attracting all new users. <br><br>  Together with colleagues from Relap.io, a test proposal was formed, after which we had to evaluate its conversion rate. <br><br><h2>  Decision </h2><br><ul><li>  Search for a relevant audience by analyzing the texts and behavior of media readers. </li><li>  Placement of native advertising on large media platforms. </li><li>  Geo-targeting on cities in Russia, where Rostelecom wants to attract new users. </li></ul><br><h2>  Result </h2><br>  Advertising efficiency increased by 10% -20%, depending on the specifics of the campaign. <br><br>  Concerning the interaction and preparation of materials, no difficulties arose.  Colleagues from Relap.io, processed our brief, gave their recommendations on the preparation of creatives and we started to work. <br><br><hr><br>  <strong>Comment <a href="https://relap.io/">Relap.io</a></strong> <br><br>  <strong>How are we looking for a relevant media audience?</strong> <br><br>  Media use Relap not only as an advertising platform, but also as a recommendation system.  There are more than 3,500 Russian media outlets, among them RIA Novosti, Izvestia, Life, Drive2, AdMe.  The total audience of 60 million people. <br><br>  We know where and what articles users read and analyze the content of texts.  Thanks to this, we can distinguish audience segments by interest. <br><br>  For Rostelecom, we found readers who have recently been interested in home Internet services and related topics. <br><br>  Advertising Relap works cross-domain: for example, we can show Rostelecom advertising on Izvestia for those who have previously been interested in articles about the quality of the home Internet on other sites. <br><br>  So by analyzing user behavior, we managed to bring people who were interested in its services and promotions to the Rostelecom website. <br><br><hr></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/317244/">https://habr.com/ru/post/317244/</a></p>
