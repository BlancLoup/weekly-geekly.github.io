It tells about specific documents, their purpose, and so, all sorts of little things.  The first part can be read <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/my_business/47845.html">on the link</a> . <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  4. Documents and their purpose </h1><br>  Before discussing documents, it is necessary to remind of such a concept as the authentication of securities for a bank.  At the moment when you conclude an agreement with the bank, you prepare a card with samples of signatures and a seal imprint (if there is one, an individual can easily have it).

      Signatures on any document to be recognized as valid may be from one to two.  The first signature and the second signature respectively.  In addition, there may be two first signatures, and there may also be two second signatures. <br><br>  This mode is designed to more conveniently control the account.  For example, the director and his deputy have the first signature, respectively, the chief accountant and his deputy have the second.  For a document to be recognized by a bank, any first and any second signature is sufficient. <br><br>  Of course, at the same time, if the deputy director and deputy chief accountant in collusion, they will be able to cool the company cool :) <br><br>  The document itself is checked for correctness of filling and for coincidence of signatures by an employee of the bank (usually it is a transaction officer assigned to you).  If she has doubts, she can get a sample card and check. <br><br>  Remember that obtaining any documents from the bank may require a power of attorney, however, a power of attorney is not needed in order to carry them there.  For example, if the payment order is filled out correctly, the signatures are the same and the seal is correct, the bank employee does not have the right to refuse to accept it. <br><br><h2>  4.1.  Payment order (payment) </h2><br>  A payment order is used to transfer non-cash money (that is, the bank's obligation to one customer) from one person to another.  The form of the payment order does not change for quite a long time, and to an unprepared person may seem like a Chinese certificate. <br><br><h2>  4.2.  Letter of credit </h2><br>  I‚Äôll just make a reservation that I will not consider all types of letters of credit here, the task is to explain what it is.  For details, you know, you can use the search. <br><br>  So, I have a deal with my supplier.  I want to buy a product for any amount, and I have it in my account.  I go to the bank, I put there a piece of paper in the prescribed form (it is called a letter of credit), which indicates to whom the money will be transferred (i.e., the details of my supplier) and what are the conditions (for example, the payment will be made only if documents confirming the delivery). <br><br>  The bank accepts the letter of credit and charges me a fee, after which it notifies the payee‚Äôs bank that the letter of credit has been accepted and the bank certifies my intention to pay. <br><br>  As soon as the invoice for the transfer of goods is signed by both parties and submitted to the bank, payment is made. <br><br>  At present, a letter of credit is rarely used.  Rather, it is hardly used because of its complexity for understanding the Russian person, and also because the bank can ask a non-sickly percentage (from 1 to 8) for making such a transaction.  However, abroad it is quite common and is a good deal insurance. <br><br>  It should be understood that the letter of credit is also a subtype of a payment order, only in this case the bank is the certifying party. <br><br><h2>  4.3.  Check </h2><br>  We all watched American films in which the main character receives or issues a check.  Honestly, I once liked it very much and wanted to try it myself :) <br><br>  First, let's see what a check is.  A check is an instruction to the bank to pay in cash the amount from a bank account to a specific person.  And only him, no one else. <br><br>  If I have a bank account and I want to be able to write checks, I need to buy a checkbook at the bank.  There are 50 checks in it, in which my requisites are already entered, it costs usually from 25 to 50 rubles. <br><br>  After I received the book, I can fill out a check.  In it, I specify the person to whom the amount is issued, what exactly the amount and on what basis the amount is charged.  For example, if I withdraw money for wages to employees, or for ‚Äúmiscellaneous expenses,‚Äù I indicate this on the check.  The reason for this indication is simple - the bank takes a different percentage for withdrawing money for different needs.  The lowest percentage is on salary. <br><br>  The sweet process of filling the check begins.  It has several subtleties. <br><br>  First, in the fields where the amount is indicated and the recipient, after the amount is written there, dashes are put so that it is impossible to add anything. <br>  Secondly, no (absolutely no) corrections to the check are allowed. <br>  Thirdly, one bank may require writing a round sum without kopecks, and another may require adding "00 kopecks". <br><br>  After the check is filled to the fullest extent, the person who entered there with passport data is sent to the bank and receives money.  Hooray :) <br><br><h2>  4.4.  Payment request </h2><br>  As the name implies, this document applies when you need to demand payment.  It's simple. <br><br>  For example, I rent premises from the city administration.  The contract stipulates that I must give the administration the right to charge me the amount of the rent if I delay it for more than 10 days.  I submit a copy of the contract to the bank and the bank makes it possible. <br><br>  Now, imagine that I have delayed the payment.  The administration refers the Bank to the ‚ÄúPayment Request‚Äù document, in which it clearly indicates how much I should be charged and on what grounds.  My bank, having received such a requirement, debits the required amount from my account. <br><br>  The payment request I reviewed is called unaccepted, i.e.  does not require my consent (I was obliged to this agreement).  In real life, there is also an acceptance payment request, in which everything looks the same as I described, only for write-off I must also express my consent :) <br><br><h2>  4.5.  Collection </h2><br>  According to the collection, the bank can receive money from a third party for me, for example, from my buyer, and then transfer it to my account.  In essence, this is a payment request, only executed by the bank instead of me. <br><br>  However, in the practice of Russian use of collection, the most frequent situation is different.  The right to use the collection on the current account of any company enjoys tax inspection.  For example, I did not pay taxes for the past quarter.  One joyful morning, I will see that I have written off the necessary amount at the request of the tax inspectorate. <br><br>  It should also be said that there is a commission for processing any document.  The difference is only in its size.  So, for example, a payment order costs from 12 to 25 rubles per share, but it is not worth a penny if I pay taxes on this order.  The exact cost should be seen in the bank account agreement. <br><br><h1>  5. All sorts of stuff about the bank </h1><br>  <i>I tell on the example of the Security Council of the Russian Federation</i> <br>  In general, working with a bank is as follows.  The department is opened for current accounts at 9 am.  I, as a client, having a power of attorney, or being the holder of the first signature, receive such a thing as an ‚Äúextract‚Äù, if it exists.  The statement is in the event that operations were carried out, and the statement is made for each day with operations. <br><br>  Taking an extract, I can understand who paid me and how much, since copies of the documents that accompanied the movements will be pinned to it.  The only exception is a check, here I must remember myself, to whom and what I wrote out. <br><br>  Also, the bank accepts any documents listed in paragraph 4 before lunch for execution on the same day.  Checks are always accepted.  So, for example, if I brought a payment order before lunch, it will be carried out and processed on this day, the next day, in the morning, my recipient will see my amount (receipt) in his statement, and I will see the expense in my statement .  If I brought a payment order after lunch, it will be processed today only if the recipient is in the same bank as me.  In another bank, it will leave only the next day. <br><br><h2>  5.1.  Internet banking </h2><br>  Many banks provide the ability for customers to manage their current accounts directly from the workplace.  Basically, such systems are called ‚ÄúClient-Bank‚Äù and a great number of them have proliferated today. <br><br>  Their main advantage lies in two things: there is no need to visit the bank and the documents are imported into the program for registration without any special problems. <br><br><h2>  5.2.  Additional services </h2><br>  In addition to being normally treated by a client in a good bank, you may also be provided (or may not) by various additional services.  For example, a bank operator can help with filling out a payment order.  However, not every bank allows you to do this. <br><br><h2>  5.3.  Cashier, cash discipline </h2><br>  This is a big question in itself, however, I will cover it a bit to make it clear.  Every company has such a thing as a cash register limit.  This does not apply to individuals and individual entrepreneurs.  Cash limit means the maximum amount of cash that may be in the cash register of an enterprise.  If you have more cash in the cashier than indicated in the limit, they must be handed over to the bank for crediting to the current account. <br><br>  The cash limit is set by the bank so that you can control the company's cash settlements. <br><br>  In addition, the bank may request the company's cash documents for verification in order to see how well cash transactions are kept. <br><br>  Here, perhaps, all that I wanted to tell.  Of course, much could remain behind the scenes, so welcome to the comments. <br><br>  With love, <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/maniaque/" class="user_link">maniaque</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30216/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30216/</a></p>
