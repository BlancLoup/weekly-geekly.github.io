But very few people know how the history of the division began, the product of which I found myself on the crash test. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/49f/c85/898/49fc8589810f43a19c9a47a80f9288db.jpg"><br>  <i>4:44, make a wish.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Prehistory </h2><br>  Previously (and now too) wristwatches were considered as fragile items.  And one day a young man, <b>Kikuo Ibe</b> (the leading developer of watches from CASIO) decided to correct this situation - he wanted to make a watch that would not break even in the event of a fall.  To solve this problem, in 1981, within the company, a working group of three people was created, which took the concept of ‚ÄúTriple 10‚Äù as the basis of their work: the watches they created had to withstand a fall from a height of 10 meters, a water pressure of 10 bar, and a service life The battery should be 10 years old. <br><br>  At that time, it was an incredibly difficult task (hello to all wearable gadgets of modernity that cannot work on the same charge for a couple of days) - after months of hard work, the group members were exhausted spiritually and physically, threatened that the project would go to a dead end is closed.  However, a solution was found.  According to the official version, Kikuo Ibe himself found him when he accidentally saw children play in one of the parks.  ‚Äú <i>During the repulsion of the ball from the ground, everything inside the ball is completely protected from impact,</i> ‚Äù he suddenly thought.  This observation led him to create a clock with a hollow design, the module of which smoothly moved in the internal space of the case.

      Then there were several years of experiments with more than 200 prototypes.  Ultimately, a shock-resistant product was born, which entered the market in April 1983 - the <b>G-SHOCK DW-5000C-1A</b> model.  They were the beginning of the unique way of G-SHOCK, during which the changes affected everything, except the principle of the basic design of 1983. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff4/27f/9ad/ff427f9ade5d46c38f23f6bbd15cfd6f.jpg"><br><br>  I had a digital watch <b>CASIO G-SHOCK GD-120CM-5E</b> in a woodland camouflage coloring on the test.  The device is the most spotted representative of the <b>G-Specials Collection</b> range - all devices have camouflage (other colors) or are intended for other similar lifestyles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/389/f78/9b9/389f789b9480405898282f01d664bc6e.jpg"><br><br>  Since initially the conversation was about the crash test, I will not focus much on the capabilities of the clock.  But at the same time, they can not be enumerated, so in short: the time (including the world, 48 cities from 31 time zones) is shown, there is a calendar, a stopwatch, a timer and 5 alarm clocks with Snooze function, LED backlight.  The cost of the watch is almost 10 thousand rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d45/c33/b04/d45c33b04822420ea8a6d66bddc047b7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f79/098/ea9/f79098ea978d4cf991f651d5cb2ca867.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb0/1b0/08f/bb01b008f9bb41aa8ca7b4423afae89e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b5d/ff3/904/b5dff3904f8b4ec8ac294cfb8ee97e2e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ff/7ae/538/1ff7ae538a5a4c14909a12fbad751189.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0c5/79f/fde/0c579ffde5c045e5882ec24a6e4c6962.jpg"><br><br>  The watches are quite massive (weight is 72 grams), their presence on the hand will be constantly felt, although you will soon get used to the size.  Both the watch and the strap are made of a special, especially durable polymer that is resistant to various external stimuli. <br><br><h2>  Let's go! </h2><br>  Before the start of crash tests, I spent some time on YouTube, watching how other people tormented the G-SHOCK watch.  It is a pity that this wasted time will not return - all the tests were some kind of bland, boring and not revealing.  Perhaps because people tormented their own watches and they didn‚Äôt have the task to break them.  My initial conditions were somewhat different - the clock was not mine, but got to the test;  at the same time, the potential death of the device was agreed upon, therefore in the tests it was decided not to lisp and not play with the clock in calf tenderness.  Break so break.  As in the "diamond hand" - to beat hard, but carefully. <br><br>  I did not have a crash test plan as such - I just had some sophisticated versions of torture, which were decided to be implemented according to the principle ‚Äúfrom simple to complex‚Äù.  Something suggested on Twitter and instagramme, here are some of the options: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Wash with the help of AED.</b>  AVD - High Pressure Apparatus, the most famous representative - ‚ÄúK√§rcher‚Äù at the car wash.  There is an AED with a pressure of 120-220 bar, while the manufacturer supplied the watch with waterproof properties at pressures up to 20 bar.  An interesting option - in theory, the watch should be beautifully cut with a stream of water. <br><br></li><li>  <b>The explosion of firecrackers.</b>  In view of the approaching NG, he took this option to work without question. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Wash in a washing machine.</b>  At first, this test seemed suitable to me, but after the first tests it became clear that nothing interesting would have happened with the washing machine.  Yes, and camouflage spots would still not be washed;) <br><br></li><li>  <b>Play for hours in hockey.</b>  Sport is life! <br><br></li><li>  <b>Roll in the sand.</b>  The easiest way to spoil the display of any gadget, about it just below. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Put under the jack.</b>  Why not?  Every time I do a tire with some gadget! <br><br></li><li>  <b>Microwave oven.</b>  Instant death for electronics of hours and, most likely, for a microwave. <br><br></li><li> <b>Shoot with a pistol.</b>  In principle, near the house there is a shooting complex, where you could agree on a crackdown on the clock.  But let's be realistic: it's clear that none of the civilian gadgets can resist firearms, so this option is only suitable for a spectacular farewell to the device.  On the other hand, during my school years I was in the museum of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and there I remember a police badge that saved the owner from a bullet - what if the clock was also bulletproof? </li></ul><br>  In any case, already in the middle of drawing up the plan, it became clear that the clock would not survive, but it was a mystery at which of the stages they would go the distance. <br><br><h2>  <b>Test 1.</b> Wear resistance of glass </h2><br>  The manufacturer reports that the watch uses scratch-resistant mineral glass.  I do not know what exactly is meant by mineral glass, nor do I know the composition of the Gorilla Glass, however, I was almost 100% sure that there would be nothing with glass. <br><br>  Not wrong.  From the usual knife and other sharp objects, the screen of the clock does not feel any emotions - you can safely lead with a blade, no traces and scratches will remain.  But in the same way you can do it with many smartphones, for example, my old video with the crash test of my HTC HD2 screen: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/nPPpWz66TUo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi0O6hSb75SyOKoHnBIzJIR6KLEgg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  However, you can scratch the screen.  Like the CASIO G-SHOCK watch, like any smartphone with Gorilla Glass.  According to the Mohs scale (mineralogical scale of hardness), Gorilla Glass has approximately 5.5‚Äì6 points, which means that any harder mineral can damage it.  And such is full: for example, quartz (7 points), which can easily be in your pocket in the form of grains of sand.  Easily and naturally, these grains of sand will scratch everything in the world, and the screen as well - you will not even notice.  Well, or topaz / corundum / diamond - if you (or your girlfriend) wear tzatskis with these stones, use diamond coated drills, then the screens of your devices are in danger. <br><br>  There are other materials that can make scratches on the screen - for example, my beloved titanium, an extremely hard metal.  With a titanium ring you can easily draw something on any glass, including on the glass of a CASIO watch.  Sometimes I regret that the ring is titanium - all the dishes are scratched. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/089/090/8b6/0890908b6f4d4cb9aa6fe3cc99438f1a.jpg"><br><br>  One feels that the glass is thick and very durable - even nuts can be prickled on it, nothing will happen (it‚Äôs a pity that I didn‚Äôt take a photo / video), although the reverse side of the clock is much better suited for this. <br><br><h2>  <b>Test 2.</b> Water </h2><br>  The manufacturer claims not only moisture resistance and water resistance, but direct protection against water protection (the fifth class of protection, the highest for the company is up to 20 bar of pressure, that is, with such a clock it is theoretically possible to dive to a depth of 200 meters). <br><br>  Unfortunately, there were no deep-sea dives, however, water became the first element that the clock encountered.  First, just under the tap, then in the kettle of water. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae0/c58/bee/ae0c58bee7d648b9a15d55102ab97451.jpg"><br><br>  Electronics goes, and bubbles, despite cavities in a design, do not leave.  Boring <br><br><h2>  <b>Test 3.</b> Boiling water </h2><br>  It is especially important that the clock worked in boiling water - it is useful, for example, if you cook shrimp.  Because if you don‚Äôt cook it, they will be hard, and if you digest, they will be like porridge.  Well, or what else sugar in the tea stir, when there is no spoon - not the same finger? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc1/116/906/bc111690692846dc9eac9e7e43814b00.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff0/227/b3b/ff0227b3b2504cae9e61794df7b1cbbd.jpg"><br><br>  I did not rule out that the plastic device may melt from a long stay in boiling water, or something happens to the paint.  But then I thought - the same watch was designed specifically to break off people like me during crash tests!  Therefore, the clock went and went. <br><br><h2>  <b>Test 4.</b> Ice </h2><br>  Nowhere did I find the working temperature range for this watch model, but this does not mean that they should not work in the cold.  On the contrary - in the cold they simply have to work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c87/a32/db4/c87a32db42d54c35b0a2695dc2713165.jpg"><br><br>  I had to use the refrigerator freezer in the office where the minimum temperature was set - minus 32 degrees.  Just freezing the clock is not interesting, so they went into the freezer in the original stylish case in which they are sold.  The case itself was filled with water. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/529/e7e/6de/529e7e6de74d4901ab7763876a8bf018.jpg"><br><br>  After a while, it turned out to be a hexagonal ice spike with a sticking strap coated with hoarfrost.  They barely pulled it out, as the case side interfered - they washed the clock in boiling water and decided to freeze it again, in a more convenient (for later experiments) container. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1d0/507/6c0/1d05076c0f7c4b3f8a57ff98735dc315.jpg"><br><br>  A knife digged the ice to the dial - go! <br><br><h2>  <b>Test 5.</b> Shocks and falls </h2><br>  Need to use watches as brass knuckles, and on them an uncomfortable block of ice?  No problem.  No need to wait until the clock is thawed - the fastest way to free them from the ice captivity is by hitting the floor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3f1/230/a1e/3f1230a1eff147dc800c6e3a8322ecf0.jpg"><br><br>  I want to note that all previous experiments were repeated several times.  From cold to boiling water, from there to the freezer again, and so on.  So with the falls.  The first test was successful - the ice shattered into small pieces, and for hours at least henna.  Given that they fell on one of the most ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù gadget surfaces - tile. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/37f/b0e/12c/37fb0e12cce744dba141ddde6df991d5.jpg"><br><br>  Each of us sometimes nerves nerve.  Someone at this moment smokes cigarettes, someone - foul language, and someone kicks a cat or throws the phone into the wall.  Therefore, it was necessary to test the CASIO G-SHOCK and in this case, so the clock again flew to the floor, but with more power (and without a protective layer of ice).  And again there was nothing for them - they just bounced aside, not a single detail fell off, there was not a scratch on the watch. <br><br>  But on the third roll, unfortunately, the integrity of the watch dropped out of the distance - the sentence ‚Äú <i>Straight with all the dope, throw!</i>  ‚ÄùWas taken by my colleague too close to my heart.  Pay attention to the force with which the watch is thrown, as well as to the fact that they withstood the first such fall (without ice): <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y5S3JnVF3OM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhbPmeU0M2wTCkkixj3STmV4YHnfA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The clock broke - the blow was so strong (and, apparently, at an unfortunate angle) that the bottom metal cover literally tore off: it was attached to 4 screws - their legs (with thread) stuck in the clock, but the caps pulled off and the cover flew off, and with it flew all the contents. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/185/e20/44e/185e2044e0ff4f248b8a81ed61b439b0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d4/b47/cfd/8d4b47cfdf164060be5b07c7ba117a46.jpg"><br><br>  But it is worth paying tribute to the fact that there was still no scratch on the watch!  And the installed glass was safe and sound!  That is, if more reliable screws were used, then something would hardly have happened with the clock.  The detached strap does not count - he just knocked out the sleeve, which was put in place after 5 minutes (the sleeve itself was searched longer - rolled under the aquarium). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/04c/dad/8b2/04cdad8b26df422d8bd09a73afe59626.jpg"><br><br>  On the one hand, the clock fell apart and failed the test.  On the other hand, I just started to get a taste :) The case is like new, and if you spend time assembling the parts that have scattered, there are non-zero chances that the watch would work again.  Therefore, I decided to glue the lid on the superglue and consider the clock conditionally alive to check the mechanical strength of the case itself. <br><br>  Nevertheless, I want to note that I am surprised at the mechanical resistance of the watch.  They were thrown very strongly, not at all like they were thrown in many other crash tests.  And they are not broken the first time - this means that, under normal conditions, you can not worry about them.  If someone hits them, they will be pinched by the doors of the subway or they will simply fall to the floor - nothing will happen to them. <br><br><h2>  <b>Test 6.</b> The explosion of firecrackers </h2><br>  Before the New Year holidays, there are especially many shops of all kinds of pyrotechnics on the streets.  And if in my childhood I had to behave well for several months for a pack of ‚Äúcorsairs‚Äù, now I can afford to buy it with my pocket money, without good behavior. <br><br>  It would be possible to start the clock on some rocket, but with these things the jokes are bad, so I just bought three packs of Corsair-5 firecrackers and one pack of Corsair-8 ‚Äî the largest one ever. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9f7/eb5/bd3/9f7eb5bd39ae4636892afedd109e2b36.jpg"><br><br>  The watch strap was enough for 12 ‚Äúsmall‚Äù corsairs - a little more space was left for Bengal lights.  After all, it was necessary to somehow simultaneously set fire to and blow up all the firecrackers, so that the arms and legs would remain in place, and the whole mess was captured on video.  In this regard, Bengal lights came in very handy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/438/d7d/796/438d7d79692b4f8e9bb220c63bba4581.jpg"><br><br>  An explosion (quite loud) thundered, a cloud of smoke appeared - there were no hours in place.  As it turned out they were not around.  After 5 minutes of searching, a watch strap (whole and intact) was found in the grass in 5 meters, and after another 5 minutes - the watch itself.  And, surprisingly, also safe and sound!  But again, the strap hub flew out, and it was pointless to look for it in the grass.  And without it, the strap could not be attached in order to continue testing with the corsairs. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/tY2-XQoANEU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhibxua5ovMCfX0vIjGXnjcmpVHYEA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  And I thought - if from 12 firecrackers (even if they didn‚Äôt explode all at once), nothing happened, why suddenly everything should turn inside out from a little larger firecracker in size?  ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I replied to myself and carried the clock to the next test. <br><br><h2>  <b>Test 7.</b> Jack </h2><br>  It is difficult to come up with a more ridiculous test for watches than hitting a car wheel on them.  The weight of my car is about 1200 kg, that is, roughly 300 kg is distributed to each wheel.  And considering the contact area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe wheel and the size of the clock, it turns out that you can just sit down with the same success - the result will be the same. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/285/b4e/9f3/285b4e9f3278469088c1b3cd09279fe9.jpg"><br><br>  But to use a watch as a jack (more precisely, as a gasket between a car and a jack) is a more indicative test of strength. <br><br>  I take out a jack, put a clock on it and place the design right under the car's side member.  For quite a long time the car went up ... but then there was a characteristic cotton - the glass burst.  Sweet and with a crunch.  Unfortunately, the gained height would not be enough for tire, but if you lower the wheel, then it could well be removed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b7c/6f7/ab8/b7c6f7ab8a144d7c8536cad5ec41e1c6.jpg"><br><br>  I take out the "terminator" from under the press, inspect.  The screen really crunched, shattered into small pieces.  Although in some pieces it was clear how thick glass is used - about 2 mm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/583/ccb/bd3/583ccbbd39064d328dd1e90dd134c8a6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/26d/dbc/0af/26ddbc0af5ef47b5ae8d2f7626a90b78.jpg"><br><br>  Also the device case bent, some buttons fell out.  From the geometry of the damage, it can be concluded that the clock was again unlucky with the tester (that is, with me) and the torture tool: the jack pad has a small depression under the ledge on the side member, so the clock literally pushed through with this ledge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fc5/42b/063/fc542b06366744b6867111e7364704b3.jpg"><br><br>  And if the jack and the support were flat (unsafe from an automobile point of view), then the watch would have a much better chance of survival: they would not be pressed through, but flattened.  And in this case, it would be more likely to survive - even after the second ‚Äúdeath‚Äù it is clear how mechanically durable the material of the device body is. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c18/790/40d/c1879040db244525bc206eb6489a1fa7.jpg"><br><br>  Further experiments on the clock, it was decided to stop, as this would no longer be a crash test, but a mockery of those who died twice in peacetime. <br><br><h2>  What's inside </h2><br>  Even after the clock scattered on the staircase, I looked inside.  Powered by a CR2025 battery, which, by the way, was torn off during a roll on the floor.  The manufacturer claims that the clock can work from it for as long as 7 years, provided that the backlight will turn on only once a day, and the alarm clock will not work longer than 20 seconds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/23b/fa1/a98/23bfa1a986104d2bba8ebcaaf2c24630.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb5/28d/768/fb528d768be44c95ab44abec468d1f73.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/535/b13/193/535b13193a794b73bdd0aa49f1503dc2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e07/420/884/e0742088401c4656a493e777ae4052dd.jpg"><br><br>  Only one shawl, one display, one battery and several rubber seals - that's the whole stuffing.  Each of their layers was securely fastened in a white plastic tie on the latches. <br><br><h2>  Total </h2><br>  The Internet is full of videos with crash tests of these (or similar) hours, but almost everywhere all tests pass in a rather benign mode.  From viewing them, a false impression can be created that the watches are generally unkillable - unfortunately, this is not the case, and I visually proved it.  If you wish, you can break anything, even a cast-iron ball - therefore, having entered into a rage, you should not forget that we are talking about watches.  Let with the strengthened armor, but it is hours, and they will not work if on them the freight train will pass.  In my opinion, it is quite logical. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b8b/22a/71e/b8b22a71e6d647b78ac91a860a0b78c0.jpg"><br><br>  What is the worst sound can make a gadget with a screen?  That's right, the sound of a crashing screen.  And if you do not engage in nonsense, like me, then you most likely will not hear this sound from G-SHOCK.  For 7 tests at the clock, the end of the world came twice: in the first case, the electronics died (by stupidity), in the second - the shell itself.  But in both cases the circumstances were far from reality and were chosen only for reasons of effect;  in real life, you are unlikely to stick your hand with the clock under the jack or, with all the dope, hammer them against the wall.  Therefore, the conclusion suggests itself - if you use the clock in the normal mode, then anything can hardly happen to them at all. <br><br>  Oh yes.  Hours died in the framework of the <a href="http://special.habrahabr.ru/g-shock/">special project with the company CASIO</a> - on its page you can win the same, only new ones! <br><br>  <b>C coming!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365863/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365863/</a></p>
