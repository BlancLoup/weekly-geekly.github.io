However, even here something remains unchanged for decades.  For example, human interaction interfaces ‚Äî they have hardly changed since the early years of computers.  However, now fundamentally new ways of communication are closer than many people think.  Simply download the released Intel RealSense SDK Beta and start designing intuitive, human-oriented interfaces.  No, just downloading the SDK is not enough ... well, first things first. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="https://software.intel.com/realsense">The Intel RealSense SDK</a> continues and develops the ideas embodied in the Perceptual Computing SDK, a tool for creating computer device control interfaces using hands, face, and voice.  The developer is available to track the position of hands and fingers, analysis of facial expressions, the use of elements of augmented reality, speech recognition, and that's not all.  In order for all this wealth to be fully applied in practice, special 3D cameras are needed.  A sample camera module already exists and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/211168/">was demonstrated</a> at the beginning of this year at CES.  Currently, Intel is negotiating with major manufacturers of equipment for cooperation - the integration of the camera into their devices.  Agreements have already been reached with vendors such as ASUS, Dell, Fujitsu, HP, Lenovo and others. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/52a/a5b/31f/52aa5b31fcfd4536859dfb564d7fffdb.jpg"><br>  <i>Intel RealSense SDK allows you to track up to 76 face points</i> <br><br>  What specific features does the new Intel RealSense SDK offer us?  We list the points: <br><ul><li>  <b>Facial expression.</b>  Face analysis now supports depth and allows you to track up to 76 key points to build the most accurate 3D mask, as well as the definition of turns and head tilt.  The software can not only fix the presence of a person in sight, but also determine its emotional state. </li><li>  <b>Hands and fingers.</b>  Intel RealSense SDK detects and tracks gestures and the position of hands and fingers in the range from 0.2 to 1.2 m. The number of reference points has increased to 22, this will make the interface smoother and more accurate. </li><li>  <b>Gestures.</b>  The gesture recognition system defines static positions and certain hand movements, such as grabbing / dropping, moving, increasing / decreasing, and so on. </li><li>  <b>Speech</b>  Voice communication is the most intuitive way for a person to interact.  Intel RealSense SDK includes speech recognition algorithms created by Nuance. </li><li>  <b>Augmented Reality.</b>  Intel RealSense SDK, one of the leaders in this field, Metaio, took part in the development of the Augmented Reality module.  Available tools allow you to create believable virtual worlds with complex content. </li><li>  <b>3D scanning.</b>  This module is not part of the Intel RealSense SDK Beta, it will appear later in the SDK release in 2014, but it may interest you now.  Designed in collaboration with 3D Systems, Inc.  3D scanning module allows you to receive, edit and share 3D images of small objects. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce8/954/616/ce89546163514f1cbb8979f41be2913a.jpg"><br>  <i>Intel RealSense SDK tracks 22 points on the arm and joints</i>

      Hardware and software requirements for the operation of the Intel RealSense SDK: <br><ul><li>  Processor - Intel Core 4 generation and higher; </li><li>  Operating system - Microsoft Windows 8.1 64-bit; </li><li>  Programming languages ‚Äã‚Äã- C ++, C #; </li><li>  Microsoft Visual Studio - VS 2008, VS 2010. </li></ul><br>  Along with the release of the Intel RealSense SDK, the IDZ launched a <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/realsense">forum</a> to discuss issues related to the product. <br><br>  I would like to emphasize that the Intel RealSense SDK is not compatible with the previous generation Perceptual Computing Camera.  This is done because much of the new functionality of the old camera is not supported;  in addition, backward crutches can subsequently hinder the development of technology. <br><br>  Now about the difficulties mentioned at the beginning.  Unfortunately, the Intel RealSense camera model currently available for developers has not yet been released.  The Intel site is now <a href="http://click.intel.com/intelr-realsensetm-developer-kit.html">pre-ordering</a> a camera for the price of $ 99 (without immediate payment, only reservation).  Those who intend to seriously engage in intuitive interfaces has washed to reserve the camera now.  Its sales will begin in the 4th quarter of this year. <br><br>  And you can do more inventive.  Right now, the Intel RealSense App Challenge 2014 application contest is taking place (for more information about the conditions of the competition, please read <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/230969/">here</a> )  The participants who passed to the second round will receive the Intel RealSense camera absolutely free of charge and at the time already agreed.  Reception of applications will end in a few days.  Hurry up, you still have time to jump on the last step!  And you probably will not regret it later. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/238137/">https://habr.com/ru/post/238137/</a></p>
