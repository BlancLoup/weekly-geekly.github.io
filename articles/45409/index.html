Like, completely at the hands of strayed, scum!  They do not want to do anything. <br><br>  Of course they do not.  Nobody wants.  And some want to benefit their projects, but do not know how best to do it.  Or they know, but they didn‚Äôt read the wrong book, so one harm from them.  In general, there are different customers. <br><br>  The first thing to remember: customers are actually useful (and not idiots, no). <br>  Second: the customer is, in fact, the same resource as a programmer or designer. <br>  Third: the main task of the project manager (we all know who <i>actually</i> drives the universe <i>(devilish laughter)</i> ) is to learn how to manage a customer as effectively as programmers.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>So.</b>  The customer is, in fact, the same resource as a programmer or designer.  It doesn‚Äôt matter whether it‚Äôs external or internal.  The designer knows how to draw websites, the programmer knows how to make them work, and the customer understands (yes, today we will assume that he understands) what is the profit and the main meaning here.  The customer also has useful resources like editors, on which, like on rabbits, you can test all interface innovations.  You can also use them as a test text generator. <br><br>  The main difficulty in managing the customer as a resource is that the customer in no case should know that he is a resource.  Moreover, the customer must sincerely believe that the cause of all this movement, in fact, is himself.  If it were not for him ... Yes, it's terrible to think what it would be! <br><br>  It is in this state from the customer the most useful. <br><br>  Customers (yes, almost all) suffer from a lack of attention.  Do not write them long letters.  The ideal letter consists of two lines.  Maximum - out of three.  And of these three lines (better than two) it should be clear what the problem is and what are the options for resolving it.  In addition, the Ideal Letter to the Customer must answer the question ‚ÄúWhat is the problem with the choice of a decision‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhen the decision needs to be made‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>About the decisions.</b>  You, of course, know better what the customer needs.  Of course, you have already thought through all the options, took into account all the risks, considered the resources, discarded the foolish ideas and set the task in development (because the deadline, as always, ‚Äúyesterday‚Äù and there is no time for desalinization). <br><br>  A brilliant letter to the Customer is in the same three lines (preferably two), carefully and imperceptibly leads the customer to the choice of the right solution. <br><br>  <b>About the deadline.</b>  A normal person wants to work only if this work prevents a universal catastrophe.  And even a normal person will not do such a responsible job on time.  And the customer is a person (no, well, really!).  Therefore, if you need an edge by Friday, write a Hysterical Letter to the customer about Monday.  At best, you will receive them by Wednesday (if you‚Äôve got a good deal on Monday and Tuesday).  At worst - by Friday. <br><br>  <b>About hysterical letters.</b>  A hysterical letter may consist of one word or two pages (or four and a half paragraphs, it does not matter).  But this does not cancel the first rule of the fight club - the first three lines should contain a maximum of useful information.  Since, as a rule, Hysterical Letters describe quite serious technical problems and require the customer to make informed decisions, the first three lines should a) make the customer understand that the galaxy is in danger b) encourage him to continue reading and making an immediate decision. <br><br>  As a result of clandestine studies of many years, the reference phrase was derived, with which any hysterical letter should be started: ‚ÄúColleagues, you have problems.‚Äù <br>  If you have a very trusting relationship with the customer, the word ‚ÄúProblems‚Äù can be replaced with any other, more capacious word. <br><br>  It is important, however, to keep the pronoun ‚Äúyou‚Äù.  The customer does not always identify himself with the problems of his projects.  Some people mistakenly believe that the problems of ‚Äúprogrammers who do not do anything again!‚Äù. <br><br>  And, yes, Hysterical Letters are most effective if used rarely.  And it will turn out like in a fairy tale about a boy and wolves. <br><br>  <b>About the tasks.</b>  Do not be afraid to set tasks for the customer.  He is a resource (only, shhh! Anyone!), He must comply with them.  It is, after all, in his own best interest.  Set tasks just as you set them for a programmer.  You do not ask him: ‚ÄúWrite me a code, my friend!‚Äù.  And why do you ask the customer to tell you why in general all this is necessary? <br><br>  The task should be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_(project_management)">clear, measurable, consistent, realistic and time-</a> bound (ehegei! Well, you are managers!). <br><br>  <b>About the language.</b>  Customers don't know a damn about technology.  And they should not.  When you tell them ‚Äúthe faddie doesn‚Äôt shout‚Äù they can‚Äôt link it to ‚Äúthe pictures are not displayed‚Äù.  They get hysterical.  They shout "It broke!".  Talk to them in human language.  Or say something soothing to them like ‚ÄúYou better not know it.  Everything's under control.  Now everything will work. ‚Äù.  It helps, really. <br><br>  <b>About age.</b>  Treat customers like children.  Teach them.  Share knowledge.  Allow to invent names for servers. <br>  Customers are cool.  True.  And it's so great when one day you hear on the phone: ‚ÄúThe editor cannot go into the back office ... Did you have a session server again?‚Äù. <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/45409/">https://habr.com/ru/post/45409/</a></p>
