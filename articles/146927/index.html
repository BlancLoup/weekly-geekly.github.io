      Each person underwent interviews or interviews, some of them were interesting, some were not very.  I will not give examples of how not to do it or how it is done ideally. <br><br>  I continue my style of presentation - the maximum of specificity, use and practice.  The whole philosophy will be in the comments or personal messages. <br><br>  If this topic is interesting to you and there is something to share with habrachitelechami - please under the cat. <br>  + Bonus at the end of the article. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  1. I'll start with the main thing.  Why are we looking for an employee? </h5><br>  Although the question seems simple, in fact it involves some kind of brain activity and getting a specific result - the text of a vacancy.  If you have any difficulties with the preparation of a vacancy, contact the HR-manager - this post is for the interview itself. <br><br><h5>  2. Test task </h5><br>  The second thing you need to prepare is a test task that a person can perform, either at an interview or at home.  Be sure to set the deadline for the assignment, this assignment should not take more than 3 hours to complete.  Ideal for 1-2 hours.  The ideal test task is aimed at identifying those places that are not described in the documentation, but which are identified only with experience.  Therefore, here we check - knows / does not know. <br><br><h5>  3. Technical questions on the topic </h5><br>  The third thing you need to prepare for an interview is a list of questions, both very simple and very complex, which greatly exceed the level of requirements for this vacancy.  It is very important that the list is uniform for all - this will help objectively compare the technical level of the candidates among themselves.  You can give some simple tasks, such as writing a function on php using recursion, to calculate N!  (factorial). <br><br><h5>  4. General questions on the summary. </h5><br>  Fourth, find out how a person lives, why he went to this institute, why he chose this particular job.  What are the criteria for choosing a new job?  etc.  Standard questions on the topic, why didn‚Äôt find a job for a long time, often changed, and so on, leave to the HR manager. <br><br>  We are looking for someone close to us in spirit, and do not get to the bottom of the reasons for refusal.  I repeat - we need to understand how this person looks like us, what are his strengths, how to use him better in a team and what role should he offer to him? <br><br><h5>  5. Algorithm for an IT interview </h5><br><ol><li>  We start the interview with a story about the company, why we, what we do - we tell relevantly to the position to which the person came.  Remember that the main motivator is the work itself, so improvise at this stage, for each person - let him ask questions.  Tell us who you are looking for and what you expect from a candidate for this position. <br>  <i>Note: This dialogue will help bring the meeting to a productive course, help the candidate to relax and more adequately answer other questions.</i> <i><br></i> <br></li><li>  Further, let the applicant tell his relevant experience on the basis of the information received, i.e.  how it can be useful to the company, how its experience intersects with our requests. <br>  <i>Note: At this time you make notes that it would be good to ask or clarify.</i> <br><br></li><li>  After listening to the story, go to the list of "Technical Questions on the topic," record the answers on a piece of paper - this will help in the future to refresh the data on this candidate in order to objectively compare it with other applicants. <br>  <i>Note: here you should have a general impression about a person‚Äôs professional qualities, how he approaches the task, whether you like his questions, etc.</i> <br><br></li><li>  Now we turn to the ‚Äúgeneral questions on the summary‚Äù - here we are already doing a bilateral dialogue, question-and-answer, clarification, stories for professional life. <br>  <i>Note: at this stage, we understand "our" / "alien"</i> <br><br></li><li>  We say goodbye.  At the interview we never give an answer and assessments, we must have a definite opinion on the candidate, and this requires time for the brain to synchronize physics with metaphysics.  If you have any doubts, then you need to give a test task - discussing immediately what a person will do and for what time he should send an answer. <br></li></ol><br><br><h5>  6. After the interview: </h5><br>  We write a brief summary of this person - the pros and cons.  Maybe some kind of comments. <br>  We put everything in one pile and, in general, we make sure that all information is systematized for all candidates.  If you have agreed on something, then it must also indicate, including dates. <br><br>  If you understand that you need to send a test task, then you need to do it (if possible) immediately after the interview. <br><br>  Many companies do not spend time on giving up - on parting from a lengthy ‚Äúwe will call you‚Äù, I don‚Äôt allow myself such a thing and I don‚Äôt advise you, because the IT market is quite narrow - and we all know each other in one way or another, and therefore do not spoil the relationship It is necessary - you want to respect you, so respect you and others.  Always write a polite refusal, if you can, then a reason or some kind of advice for the future.  It is always better than just silence. <br><br>  **** <br>  And now the promised bonus <br><h5>  An example is how I was looking for a technical designer. </h5><br>  I decided to find a technical designer, but I had no idea how to test them.  Therefore, contacting people who are looking for the same professionals at a professional level - these turned out to be Art Directors.  Having interviewed several of them, I compiled a task and enlisted their support in working out these tasks, in order to assess their level. <br><br><h6>  The task turned out like this: </h6><br><br>  First task: we have a picture <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/59b/806/91d/59b80691d05ddb1c60dcded0b9c15e83.jpeg" align="left"><br>  To do the following (one of two things - by the choice of the designer): <br><br>  1) put the car in an empty room (clear glare from the glass and the body), repaint in crimson color, put a Russian license plate; <br><br>  2) to depict the car entering a sharp turn at high speed;  repaint the body in the colors of the newly Russian police, install a flashing beacon on the roof. <br><br>  Pay special attention to drawing headlights. <br><br>  The second task: to depict a tangerine tree planted in a glass pot (for the basis you can use flower.jpg from the attachment, but not a panacea).  Size of the finished jeep: 256 by 256 pixels, all textures should be sharp, the contours are well cropped.  All in the best traditions of gift icons for Vkontakte. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f81/175/2b0/f811752b052621aa7bad2f4c1657658e.jpg"><br>  - Please confirm receipt of the test task. <br>  We are waiting for your results DD.MM.YYYY, until 17:00 <br><br><h6>  Here are some results I got: </h6><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/efd/0b1/66f/efd0b166f37d091db91de41035cd7b46.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a9c/dfb/89b/a9cdfb89bccdd595be90cca9a17fe8dc.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/584/e9c/ba6/584e9cba6684084ae3ad0c977105686e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f1e/ad6/781/f1ead67819f9a350097b3995898ee7ec.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2a1/8a2/1be/2a18a21be91eb5b99cb283f4dfebe70e.jpg"><br><br>  The result - two excellent technical designers work for the company. <br>  And what test tasks do you have? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146927/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146927/</a></p>
