Personal attention to each client </h5><br>  People love personal touch and are willing to pay for it.  Remember the millions of faceless sites and applications that are the same for everyone and are good for anyone.  It‚Äôs another thing when a person is served personally, and he may not even guess that there is a smart program on that side, and not a blue-eyed blonde.  In addition, personal service opens up new opportunities for the promotion of services, additional bonuses and personal promotions, which can bring huge returns.

    <h5>  2. Text interface eats little traffic </h5><br>  This is very important in the light of the fact that about half of clients access the Internet only from mobile devices and not everyone has unlimited or high speed.  Will I have to wait until your bold website loads with a bunch of pictures and ads?  Not!!!  I will write to the bot and immediately get what I need! <br><br><h5>  3. Low cost </h5><br>  How much have you already paid for the site and mobile app?  100,000?  500,000?  Are you satisfied with the result?  Some have a slow Internet, others have Android, and some have an old iPhone version ... hell!  With bots, everything is wrong!  They can write from any device that has a browser, and the Telegram mobile app is now for everyone.  Refuse to develop / support mobile applications in favor of bots and you will save a lot of money and nerves. <br><br><h5>  4. Flexibility and speed of response </h5><br>  Need to change something?  No problem!  The bot can be fixed and restarted in 10 minutes and voila, everything goes as it should.  The client wrote through the website / application to the mail to the support / delivery / service, and these radishes responded to him only a week later?  You have definitely lost a client.  Such situations will no longer be with bots!  Instant response to any need with mailing to all responsible persons. <br><br><h5>  5. Protection from competitors </h5><br>  Your competitors intercept people who join your groups in social networks and offer them their services.  Not?  Are you sure?  With bots, only you know your customers and do not share them with competitors. <br><br><h5>  6. Does not require installation and authorization </h5><br>  To use the bot, the client does not need to download and install the application on the phone or fill in the registration form on the website or in the application.  As soon as the client has written the bot, you immediately know his name and login, thereby reducing the funnel by 1-2 steps, focusing specifically on the service or product.  Customers leave, lazy to download the application?  Use the bot. <br><br>  I think there are a couple of dozens more ... "And what's the drawbacks ?!", you exclaim, falling from the chair.  Behind this we open the greatest holivar in the comments. <br>  PS: If you or your friends need a bot, then our studio <a href="http://t-bots.ru/">t-bots.ru</a> will help with this. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296388/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296388/</a></p>
