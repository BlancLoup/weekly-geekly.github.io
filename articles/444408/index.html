  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Apple released a new iPad yesterday, and they have questions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ib/x0/mc/ibx0mcxiygnns1up2dzmtfx8l6m.jpeg"><br><br><p>  A few hours ago, Apple (quite unexpectedly) introduced the iPad Air and the new iPad mini.  They went on sale in her store.  This time, the company did not make a big presentation with a thousand journalists.  Instead, they just posted an <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/03/all-new-ipad-air-and-ipad-mini-deliver-dramatic-power-and-capability/">announcement</a> on their blog.  New devices are impressive with their characteristics.  But for inattentive users, they can turn into an extra headache. <a name="habracut"></a></p><br><br><h2>  iPad Air </h2><br><p>  The updated model, also borrowed the name of the line of macbooks (like the iPad Pro).  Ultra-slim body with a 10.5-inch display and a powerful Apple 12 Bionic chip.  The company says that it improves the performance of the device by 70% and makes it twice as easy to handle graphics.  And advanced machine learning algorithms and Core ML improve the work of the gadget in AR and makes it possible to generate photorealistic effects in 3D games. </p><br><p>  In fact, the device occupies a niche between a 9.7-inch iPad and an 11-inch iPad Pro.  The display uses technology True Tone.  It is 20% larger, and in it there are half a million more pixels (although it is not specified as to whom).  Supports work with Apple Pencil and smart keyboard. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vm/5t/kn/vm5tkn8szvkwtvet89au-q_mmw8.jpeg">

    <p>  The device costs a little less than an iPad Pro.  It comes in two versions: with 64 GB or with 256 GB of internal memory.  The cost of the first model in the US <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-air">starts</a> at $ 499, the second - from $ 649.  So far, iPad Air <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-air">is available</a> only from Apple on the official website, but it is expected to launch soon on the company's website <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/45E1434A-FD58-40A7-BC14-A698CD36DF7C%3Fingress%3D0%26amp%3BvisitId%3D57fdd14d-c5dc-4b0d-bd2e-5e7e3f0ff240">at Amazon</a> . </p><br><br><h2>  New iPad mini </h2><br><p>  The line has not been updated for three and a half years.  Many experts believed that Apple will soon announce the termination of support for these models, given that smartphones have almost reached its dimensions during this time (iPhone XS Max has a 6.5-inch screen).  But the mini-device unexpectedly returned.  It retains its 7.9-inch screen, only the one is now 25% brighter, supports more colors and works with True Tone.  The iPad mini is now "the highest pixel density in the entire iPad line." </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sy/om/w7/syomw7oollwk7byu__6c204cx00.jpeg"><br>  <i>Tim Cook rejoices in the new iPad mini</i> <br><br><p>  Inside, everything is also impressive.  The device is equipped with the same as the iPad Air, the A12 system with a 6-core 64-bit ARM-processor.  Able to shoot high-quality photos and 1080p-video, Apple especially boasts shooting in low-light conditions.  Like iPad Air, it works on iOS 12. It has a Touch ID fingerprint scanner and a Lightning connector.  Unlike larger versions of the iPad, it is equipped with a mini-jack for headphones (hooray!). </p><br><p>  Apple sees such a device as a replacement for a paper notebook.  According to them, </p><br><blockquote>  With Apple Pencil support, the new iPad mini is perfect for sketching and recording thoughts on the go. <br></blockquote><br><p>  The device is also released in two versions - with 64 GB memory (for $ 399) and 256 GB (for $ 549).  Sold only at the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-mini">office.</a>  <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-mini">site</a> .  Like the iPad Air, three colors are available: silver, gold and space gray. </p><br><br><h2>  What's the catch </h2><br><p>  Not even a day has passed since the release, and new devices have already been criticized.  According to the characteristics, appearance and even the price they are quite good.  But Apple, in an effort to preserve "beautiful" product names, may unknowingly mislead some users. </p><br><p>  So, by the name of the iPad mini is fully consistent with the previous device from its line.  What opens up wide scope for scammers and thousands of dishonest resellers.  Moreover: the device is externally identical to the model of 2015, and comes in the same box.  Determine that they have ‚Äúnot exactly the same‚Äù iPad mini, unlucky buyers can only after turning on the device and checking its characteristics. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8u/uc/h4/8uuch4g_vh_ogorbytemle0hcrq.jpeg"><br>  <i>Weekend Challenge</i> <br><br><p>  But even more, this problem with names is noticeable in another area.  In the same press release, it is separately noted that in addition to new devices, to open a full range of their capabilities, buyers should purchase an Apple Pencil stylus (for $ 99) and a smart keyboard (for $ 159, only for iPad Air). </p><br><p>  That's just the fact that six months ago, Apple introduced the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MU8F2/apple-pencil-2nd-generation">second generation Apple Pencil</a> .  And it is with new devices ... not compatible.  They only work with the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK0C2AM/A/apple-pencil">first generation Apple Pencil</a> .  Which looks very similar, only slightly longer and with a removable tip. </p><br><p>  The old Apple stylus does not know how to charge from the iPad wirelessly, attach to the body of the tablet with magnets and recognize gestures.  But the main thing - he is old!  And the devices are very new.  Tens of thousands of users can be forgiven if they consider that they need to take a second Apple Pencil. </p><br><p>  Meanwhile, the owners of the new iPad Pro also <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MK0C2AM-A-Apple-Pencil/product-reviews/B016NY7784/ref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_kywd%3Fie%3DUTF8%26amp%3BfilterByStar%3Done_star%26amp%3BreviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26amp%3BpageNumber%3D1%26amp%3BfilterByKeyword%3Dipad%2Bpro">complain</a> that they have taken the first generation Apple Pencil, but it does not work.  Still, fools!  They bought an Apple Pencil, and they needed an Apple Pencil! </p><br><p>  So now buyers of Apple appliances will have to take on even more homework.  Or wait until the company recovers with an acute attack of branding and stops fearing the simple number ‚Äú2‚Äù. </p><br><br><p>  <strong>PS</strong> For the best buy tablets, smartphones and other gadgets in the US you have Pochtoy.com.  iPhone and iPad in America are cheaper by 10-20 thousand rubles, depending on the model.
