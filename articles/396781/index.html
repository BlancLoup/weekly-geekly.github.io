Today in our blog we would like to say a few words about whether it is possible to swim in headphones with bone conduction sound. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a6/ae0/3dc/1a6ae03dcfac4d748009c25ad24f3874.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In fact, a similar question is often asked at exhibitions and at purchase, and this is very logical: firstly, the design of the headphones itself hints that they are quite tight, and secondly, the class of headphones - ‚Äúsports‚Äù - suggests that they could have complete protection against water, and thirdly, one of the ‚Äúpurposes‚Äù of bone conduction of sound is the connection with scuba divers, which Casio showed almost the first time:

However, in the basic characteristics of Aftershokz models about water resistance, everything is very categorical: <br><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_(%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%258C_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2589%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%258B_%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8)">IP55:</a></b> </li></ul><br><br>  That is, protection from dust, its deposits inside, which is guaranteed not to damage the functionality of the headphones and - the second 5 - protection from jets under pressure from any direction.  Roughly speaking: you can get under a shower, you can take a shower, and everything will be in order. <br><br>  Nevertheless, consumer headsets with bone conduction of sound, which have "water-like" waterproofing, it turns out, exist.  Some time ago, there was a model from Panasonic, for which it stands <a href="http://shop.panasonic.com/support-only/RP-HGS10-W.html">on the official website</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-RP-HGS10-W-Conduction-Headphones-Reflective/dp/B00QN43YFU">on Amazon</a> : "Waterproof."  True, thank you for marking the class on the official website: IPX4, and this is ‚Äúdust-free‚Äù and one unit worse than Aftershokz - spray. <br><br>  Here, too, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/262934/">we mentioned a Chinese device</a> , the site of which is currently unavailable on Alibaba: the manufacturer also indicated that the headphones are waterproof. <br><br>  As an example, Aftershokz sports headphones, which we consider to be the best in their class: ‚Äúsports headphones with bone conduction sound technology‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>How made</b> <br><br>  In fact, they are very well made: the rubber pad is outside: the Bluez 2 model is solid, the Bluez 2S or Trekz has holes, the inside is well-glued, the parts are hermetically cleaned: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f9a/41e/ec1/f9a41eec10a345769e4fd200c08d0dab.jpg"><br><br>  Moreover, if the first photo is not very striking: the holes on the case from the inside are additionally covered with a water-repellent material: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d10/79a/8b3/d1079a8b34ae45369e1a2db15cfd1f51.jpg"><br><br>  <b>A cup</b> <br><br>  The minimum that we could do was to leave one of the models for a couple of days in a cup.  With water, of course. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a00/87d/e4e/a0087de4e9d4418288923b99573a0871.jpg"><br><br>  Under the water, we completely submerged the speakers of the headphones, leaving the control panel and - as a result - Bluetooth outside.  This, as it turned out, is important. <br><br>  Headphones and after a couple of days sounded great, including under water: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/0-_Je7_0aBw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjmcD9tavLWuJw_pX9hySXsT-10xA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The only thing that rushed "in the ear": in the first fractions of seconds, they seemed to stutter, but then the sound was restored to the original.  Of course, the water has left its mark, though, it is easy to come down: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/248/729/f04/248729f04ac44188948feb4720bd91d8.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Shower</b> <br><br>  The declared streams were the most successful: no sticking or stuttering was seen during subsequent playback, the sound from the speakers and the microphone are original.  Observation, by the way, for all cases is this: headphones should be allowed to dry out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e57/53f/f09/e5753ff091df482c98b49812d6c5d234.jpg"><br><br>  Although, given that the control panel at Aftershokz is not touch-sensitive, they are controlled with wet hands.  I spent 15 minutes in the shower and washed my hair at the same time.  I don‚Äôt know how many lovers there are to chat on the phone in the bathroom or rinse to the music, but in Aftershokz this is real.  For example, if you are waiting for an important call, but decided to take a bath ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d86/0be/102/d860be102401433db1c0a0a33729c4c0.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Pool</b> <br><br>  In the pool took two copies: Bluez 2S and Trekz.  The latter, by the way, behaved worse: if the Blues caught all 25 meters, then the Treksa began to stutter and shut off at half the distance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/194/d82/c7a/194d82c7a99045f483c4479b3b0754f2.jpg"><br><br>  The cap with them is quite comfortable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/650/7d6/67f/6507d667f1ff43058e836ceafa4f57c0.jpg"><br><br>  But it will be impossible to swim.  The fact is that when a Bluetooth sensor is submerged under water, the sound is immediately muted.  Yes, if you emerge, they instantly begin to play a melody, but it turns out that you cannot swim on your back: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/eqgQczep4Qg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhss-mIHYufvVxUwBi9dQaKChDg9Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>No sound</i> <br><br>  don't fall on your right side: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z-ldOsBCBZg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjd6jGui-14pCE_6aJbgON38tCu0g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>When turning on the right side - the sound disappears</i> <br><br>  "Frog-like" - please: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/saXLi2IXb5E%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg5IAdvBSLZ-5b8RhXvi-TiJSmgWQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>The sound is fine</i> <br><br>  In this case, they sit perfectly, do not fall down, do not get lost in the water. <br><br>  <b>After pool</b> <br><br>  The microphone is great.  The sound is the same.  All my standard track list from VC plays great, but!  For some reason, only the Gaza Strip began to ‚Äústutter‚Äù at full volume. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/58c/335/d25/58c335d2583f4092b9853bed0aab7448.jpg"><br><br>  There was a feeling that from the pocket in the first hour it became worse to catch Bluez 2S.  Now they are dry, the problem has disappeared. <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúDe facto‚Äù and ‚ÄúDe jure‚Äù</b> <br><br>  It turns out that, on the one hand, the headphones are better than all the others in their class in terms of protection against moisture, perhaps even slightly better than those claimed by the developer, but legally if it is determined that they have lost some of the possibilities due to improper handling of water - it cannot become a reason for an exchange and return, and the case will be recognized not as a guarantee.  Type: at your own risk. <br><br>  So it would be correct to say that Aftershokz sports headphones are not waterproof and are not suitable for swimming in the pool, but have the best protection against water in its class: <b>IP55 standard</b> .  Given that this opportunity is not designated anywhere as a competitive advantage, and headsets are positioned as safe due to the fact that they do not cover their ears. <br><br>  Despite the fact that we carried out our tests in fresh, tap water, they must withstand excessive sweating, heavy rain.  The sea is not known. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Aftershokz Catalog</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/aftershokzbluez-2-bluetooth.html%3Futm_source%3Dgk%26utm_medium%3Dbluez2water%26utm_campaign%3Dbluez2water">Bluez 2S in Medgadgets</a> <br>  Bluez 2S <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/268104/">on Geektimes</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/aftershokz-trekz-titanium-grey.html%3Futm_source%3Dgk%26utm_medium%3Dtrekzwater%26utm_campaign%3Dtrekzwater">Trekz in the Medgadgets</a> <br>  Action on <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/aftershokz-trekz-titanium-blue.html%3Futm_source%3Dgk%26utm_medium%3Dtrekzbluewater%26utm_campaign%3Dtrekzbluewater">blue</a> and <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/aftershokz-trekz-titanium-green.html%3Futm_source%3Dgk%26utm_medium%3Dtrekzgreenwater%26utm_campaign%3Dtrekzgreenwater">green</a> Trekz - 1000 cheaper <br>  Trekz <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/270790/">on Geektimes</a> <br></div></div><br><br>  Thank you for your attention and take care of the technique. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396781/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396781/</a></p>
