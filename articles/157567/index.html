It happens just lazy and I want to get my simple question, no less a simple and human answer, and not to go into the depths of the site, wade through a bunch of hyperlinks and stationery. <br>  Fortunately for modern online stores, they have in their arsenal a lot of tools to provide operational advice online. <br><br>  <b>Online chat</b> <br>  Online chat, live chat (or online consultant) is one of the most popular methods of online communication between an online store and potential buyers.  There are some simple guidelines for using this tool. <br><br><h5>  Location </h5><br>  It is better to place the (tab) button of the online consultation for the visitor of the online store to the right or to the left of the content field, but not in the footer of the main page or in the contacts section (precedents happen).  The client, being in any section of the site (description of the goods, description of the delivery terms, order from the basket), should easily find the live chat button.

    <h5>  Responsiveness </h5><br>  If you set up a live chat on the site, be prepared for the fact that this is an information channel of operational communication.  Highlight the employee, whose duties will answer questions from visitors.  It is very unpleasant to see widgets of online consultations which operators regularly disappear. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/899/eec/fd9/899eecfd9c245e03d9cc2ed15c25c74a.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Personal data of the operator </h5><br>  I don‚Äôt know about you, but I‚Äôm somehow uncomfortable when, via a live chat from an online store from Novosibirsk, a white-toothed dark-skinned beauty obviously found on the expanses of photo stocks addresses me.  I am not a racist and, all the more, I have nothing against white teeth.  However, stock photos of American support service operators with their Hollywood smiles look a bit strange when used in runet stores.  Real employee photo or logo look more acceptable. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3c7/0ba/0f3/3c70ba0f3d87502543f4b391c427c8e8.jpg"><br>  Do not get involved in funny nicknames.  I regularly have to communicate with support staff of one of the payment systems of the Runet, who are very successful in humor.  Vozmodno, someone seems funny to chat in an online chat with Roman Sutul, Arnold Schwachenbaum, Snezhanna Snezhkova and a dozen fictional characters, but the seriousness of the intentions of such a company does not seem so obvious.  There is a feeling that ‚Äúon the other side of the monitor‚Äù sits a company of schoolchildren who are more interested in having fun than to provide a quality service.  When a competitor is located at the ‚Äúdistance of a click‚Äù from a buyer, even such an unobvious minus cannot be ignored.  Nick in the live chat should be in the format ‚ÄúStore support service operator‚Äù, even better if it is the real name of the employee (communication with a personalized person in our digital age is doubly pleasant) <br><br><h5>  Informative </h5><br>  Do not think that live chat is another reincarnation of the site map or search function.  Often we have to deal with the fact that the support service answers a specific question with a link to one or another section of the rules.  Of course, when it comes to the conditions of the store, written on 15 PDF lists, the link is justified, but if the support operator is asked a specific question, if you please, answer quite specifically. <br><br><h5>  Literacy </h5><br>  It's simple.  She must be.  If it is not there, then a positive attitude to the resource (be it a service or a store) will not be saved by either a beautiful design or excellent usability.  As an example, I will give a screenshot of the dialogue through a live chat with a single resource support service: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b96/cfa/3e1/b96cfa3e10ee24193efb360f844a6f8c.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Skype</b> <br>  This is another popular way to communicate with the client.  The most common mistake that occurs in 60% of sites: next to the Skype button is not indicated the time when you can get advice.  The visitor can only guess when the support operator deigns to get in touch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/650/5ca/d95/6505cad95e7f553ab5aaffa1c30a0608.jpg"><br>  The operator‚Äôs working time (with indication of the time zone) is a mandatory element if you use Skype consultations.  About Skype nickname in the form of the name of the store, probably, you should not even speak.  Using a personal account for business purposes is incorrect (unless you are selling products under your own brand). <br><br>  <b>Email, contact form</b> <br>  The traditional and most popular information channel of communication with customers.  The progress of owners of online stores in the mastery of this tool on the face.  Almost all sites use the ticket system in correspondence (numbering of the message thread), this allows you to save the correspondence data with users.  Most online stores have turned to personalization support services.  When operator No. 7 deals with your question, and Julia Ivanova, a junior customer service representative, it somehow warms up. <br><br>  A typical mistake occurring on the Runet is, above all, an abundance of electronic mailboxes.  Not once, not twice, I met Internet shops where the main page was full of various emails.  There was also the address of customer service, technical support and sales, delivery, on top of all was the contact form and the address info@magazin.ru format on the page about us.  I, as a buyer, brought such a number of addresses to a dead end in order to understand to whom to send my question I had to conduct a real investigation.  You will send your message to the sales department, but they suddenly will not understand, they will say that this does not concern them, you will send it via the contact form, it‚Äôs not at all clear where your letter will come.  As a result, I bought the product in another store. <br><br>  Some may disagree, but the email address (or contact form) presented in the ‚ÄúContacts‚Äù section on the store‚Äôs website should be one.  The modern buyer has enough worries, do not load him with worries about where to send your question.  Let your secretary sort the letters, after all, this sweet girl will have something to do besides brewing an espresso and reading the new Cosmo. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/157567/">https://habr.com/ru/post/157567/</a></p>
