  <section class="page js-page"><h1>HP competition - part two, positive</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Just a week ago, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_angry/131426/">I wrote</a> about the interesting results of the competition ‚ÄúWorkplace of a dream‚Äù held at Habr√©.  Three days after that publication, the representatives of the organizers contacted me, commented on the situation with the replacement of the laptop, apologized and offered some way to smooth out the unpleasant residue. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It's time to tell you that holding a competition is the work of <a href="http://affect.ru/">Affect.ru</a> .  For those who see ads in the link, read both posts. <br><br>  The direct organizer Andrei talked to me on the phone (unfortunately, I still could not hear and remember the name).  He repeatedly apologized for the mistake made by the managers and said that initially a laptop worth about 18 thousand rubles was planned as the first prize in this competition.  But, the model of greater value was brought in as a first prize, which became clear already at the stage of summing up, that is, the organizer failed to prevent an error.  And <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_angry/131426/">our</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_angry/131426/">conjectures</a> that a laptop just started playing an adventurous manager, are wrong. <br><br>  Andrei offered to return the laptop and replace it with the HP Probook 4720s, which was originally recorded for the first prize.  I have already sold the prize, so this option did not fit in any way, as did the ‚Äúcompensation of value‚Äù offered to me with money.  In this case, my first post would be more like extortion, which I absolutely do not need.

      After listening to the apology, I promised that I would definitely add the official response of the organizer to the article, and suggested that I come up with some other way to smooth the joint.  Andrei called back some time later and said that a bottle of brandy was due from the manager :).  I refused to drink, thanked and offered to consider the moment as completely exhausted. <br><br>  A day later, Andrei called me again and said that a meeting was held at the company, during which the organizer decided to donate me another laptop, the same Probook, and also bring it to me on my own.  Actually, in the evening of the same day I was with me :) <br><br>  To say that I am surprised by such a gesture - to say nothing.  As a result, having won the competition, I won two prizes at once.  Thanks to Habr and Affect. <br><br>  If someone is interested - the full model of the HP ProBook 4720s laptop (XX844EA). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131865/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131865/</a></p>
