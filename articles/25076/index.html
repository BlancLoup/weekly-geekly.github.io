Well, they appeared and appeared, I perceived it as a kind of keyboard replacement for those who are too lazy to type - try to enter the microphone on a given topic.  But then I signed my google reader on the hacked main page of Habr and they began to appear there with incredible perseverance and periodicity, which baffled me - were they also listening?  Previously, I just somehow did not think about it, but here you have a certain coefficient of popularity on your face, let me figure out what's what. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I will say right away - nonsense.  Well, first things first, go through the masterpieces.  I specifically listened to everything that happened there in the last couple of weeks and even earlier, selectively.

      Guys, why the hell are you doing this?  Have you heard from yourself?  Take, for example, habrakast - it's some kind of garbage extravaganza.  Talk about nothing at all.  I can just as well go into some kind of "mug" and warm my ears at any table with more than two people.  What are you discussing there?  "News", which already died down all over the Internet?  If you compare the news feed in the eyes and ears, then there are no advantages.  The text I can just run through my eyes, snatching out the main thoughts and going deep if there is something sensible written there.  Audio file, I just hesitate to rewind so - oh, hell, he now said something!  Back!  And ... Mlyn, again garbage.  Well, the news can not only be submitted but also discussed, if with knowledge and revealing some hidden undercurrents and stones, and reading between the lines.  But it turns out just chatter to take time.  It makes no sense.  Of course, I understand - it‚Äôs cool to get together from different parts of the globe and at the same time discuss something.  Modern technology, everything is cool.  But it reminds me of the time when people learned from us that there is an Internet and you yourself can forget about a page where you will tell about your favorite cat, and each newly appeared webmaster considered it his sacred duty to use as many chips as he learned the best case is to read a book on html and javascript, and more often - copy from another similar page.  The fact that there is a technology that allows you to do something new is not a reason to use it.  Because technology is a frame for a diamond, not the stone itself. <br><br>  Then - all this sounds extremely reversible, is heard with difficulty.  One - kartavit (do not yell the current - I also grunt, so I use the right bespectacled to call bespectacled).  Arwen sometimes doesn‚Äôt wake up at all - you throw heavier and more frequent network packets at her there. <br><br>  In general, most of the time of all castes comes down to the caste itself.  This is almost the pattern: here I am (we), we write down the caste, blah blah blah, the number of such and such, blah blah blah, and a couple more minutes about what it is, where it is, how it is.  Also somehow echoes with, for example, websites about making money on the Internet, which tells about how to make a website about making money on the Internet, filled with matter about how to make a website about making money on the Internet.  That is podcasts about podcasts.  Well, yes, here we are, we cook in our eternal theme, it's cool, let's all come to us urgently.  Moreover, without enthusiasm, simply because they decided to do it weekly.  I think you can do this every day without much straining, and at the beginning of the cast you can discuss how the previous one turned out, and at the end tell you how next time you will discuss what you have recorded today.  Air time will be filled without problems, I give a tooth. <br><br>  I listened to Aosiniaocast - it's also not clear why he does it.  And it sounds like a person is still being paid for unloved work. <br><br>  Dolce Welle - likes to spit into the microphone and talk about what is new in his life now.  What about castes, about yourself or all the same about what is happening outside the window in the world? <br><br>  IT thoughts - mass thoughts.  Well, like everyone else, the standard is about the microphone, the voice recorder.  Oh yah, (I will soon be turned out at the mention of them).  Nothing new, everything has already been, everything is read. <br><br>  What is amusing is how the podcasters strive for the quality of the air.  The beats there, the musical inserts, are, of course, good.  Only it is necessary to begin with learning to speak - once, to write a sound - two.  And technological tricks - this is only later, a bow on top. <br><br>  But, there are also quite quite listenable things - Umputun, Rosnovsky.  These figures also like to hammer in the broadcast with the story that they are capturing the broadcast, but at least you can listen to them: there are competent phrases, they don‚Äôt slip into silly jokes and do not insert any meaningless constructions into sentences.  Almost.  Umputun - almost everything about myself.  But Rosnovsky would like to highlight the fact that he is generally slipping into the beaten track of monetization, trying to cultivate a certain brand.  That T-shirts will release, the site propiarit (gather 500 friends).  Well, in Rosnovsky‚Äôs T-shirts hardly anyone besides Rosnovsky himself will walk and the matter is not in design, I understand that it‚Äôs nice to make t-shirts with your own symbolism that (!) Anyone can even buy.  But doing advertising in the caste is somehow too much.  The most honest way is to make money from something else, and the castes, like a personal blog, are used to present your own valuable (extremely valuable) opinions to others. <br><br>  The only really interesting thing that I met was an interview with Ashmanov, provided by the same Rosnovsky.  Here and an interesting person and is able to talk and interestingly tells interesting things on the topic, without stooping down to the cats. <br><br>  To sum up: caste is now just sucks.  In general, I am a categorical person, I like to rub off my shoulder, although sometimes my elbows have to be bitten and therefore, my opinion, the stump may be clear and the assessment of the whole economy will seem to someone too harsh and pretentious.  This presentation should not be taken as a criticism of the people doing these podcasts.  All of them, of course, clever educated accomplished personalities and I do not want to offend any of them.  But this podkasterskaya razvlekuha they get frankly sucks and uninteresting (with very few exceptions).  In addition, I would like to separate personal podcasts, about myself, and that whirlwind of amazing and incredible events (and what else) in my personal life, from podcasts on a topical topic.  Still, this is not ZheZhe, with the cult of personality, and Habr, with the cult of information. <br><br>  I stand for quality content.  If you want to keep a personal blog - for God's sake, lead.  Want to write books - write.  Do you want to make music - make music.  You record podcasts - go ahead.  But it is bad - this is not when few people know about your hobby, but when you try to give people something that does not hold water.  Habr, in particular, is a place where there is a lot of good content, which won its fame, but this is not a reason to push something of low quality here in order to raise its own popularity.  There will be a cool podcast - people will post it themselves and say - see how great it is!  On the topic, he says normally, interestingly, something new.  But about a car with an automatic transmission, then why?  You probably have your own blog - there is a road to it.  If you manage to write a good text - it does not mean that you will have the same interesting podcast.  The text, all the same, disciplines, allows to return, to correct something, to add, to develop, to lick it, in order to get a candy in the end. <br><br>  And with podcasts, you are a mess. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/25076/">https://habr.com/ru/post/25076/</a></p>
