We chose LiveJournal because it is easier to start there and gain readers. <br>  <a href="http://bubbleclot.ru/">Bubbleclot community</a> created by us for the interaction of various kinds of marketers, creatives, designers and customers of high-quality kopleksnyh services. <br>  I will try to explain the essence briefly. <br><br>  In our opinion, a community of this kind is now necessary and very relevant, since  There are more and more people, and the quality falls under the pressure of most thoughtless design and advertising.  Good specialists can be counted on the fingers and toes while the rest make consumer goods.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/bubbleclot/2021.html">The principle of the Bubble Company</a> is that the number of freelancers (freelancers are our target audience, because design studios and advertising agencies should provide quality services by default, however, we will not refuse their participation either) producing a really high-quality product with an idea helping the goals of the customer must grow.  And that the interested society and customers should know such freelancers. <br><br>  - A good project differs from the checkpoint in that it has a beautiful design and an interesting concept.  It is thanks to an interesting idea, or in the particular case of an advertising concept, that a beautiful picture becomes memorable, and the site becomes original and benefits the customer‚Äôs business.  And precisely because of the good graphics and design, the advertising concept has a chance to produce an effect on the final consumer. <br><br>  - A good specialist is different because he makes good projects.  Makes a lot of good projects. <br><br>  In the context of the global financial crisis and during massive cuts, the number of freelancers in runet is increasing every day, and competition, respectively, is becoming tougher.  It seems to us that in such a situation a customer with a good budget should know about 20 freelance designers by work or style in order to maximally protect themselves from poor-quality services and scam. <br>  We will create a market of PR services for freelancers.  In the cradle of Babloklota ordinary PR people will be brought up, capable of spinning a good freelancer on the Internet for small budgets so that he will be known in the right circles.  The quality of PR services and projects manufactured by designers and marketers will increase over time, because  the community will shape the criteria for quality services, and the participants will help each other and improve themselves. <br><br>  What can and should be written in the Bubble Club? <br>  The community has several publication directions: <br><br>  - Articles on the near-designer, PR, advertising, creative themes; <br>  - Heading "Illustrative example."  A post about a project, website, advertisement or person combining high-quality design and marketing; <br>  - Evaluation of design, advertising, or ideas from the necessary point of view; <br>  - Contests, battles, contests, organized by the administration of the community; <br>  - Orders: <br>  a) On a person‚Äôs or a project‚Äôs PR <br>  b) On the development of advertising concept <br>  c) To develop a concept and design (integrated order) <br>  d) For the design of the finished advertising concept. <br><br>  Rotation and communication in one society with people more experienced in other areas will in any case have a positive effect on your work.  Designers will become better at marketing, and marketers will improve their taste.  Finally, a number of criteria will be expanded to assess the quality of the work of designers and services of marketers, and good specialists will become known.  In other words, a community of this kind keeps in itself a lot of advantages. <br><br>  Join us and let's raise the quality of work to a new level;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/49034/">https://habr.com/ru/post/49034/</a></p>
