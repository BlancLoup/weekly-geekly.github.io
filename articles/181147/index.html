  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do not do as I do. Or about your future job</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  0. Introduction. </h4><br><br>  This post may well be both a continuation and an antipost of this <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/180695/">post</a> . <br>  This is rather a brief note about my personal situation from which you can learn a useful lesson: do not do it as I do. <br>  These are my thoughts and actions, but I hope that they will help someone. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  1. Preamble or introduction. </h4><br>  It so happens that tired. <br>  That really got to work on one office and you want to change the profile orientation. <br>  Or even not so profile, but all the same - to change. <br>  And you make a decision: you get a personal HR-a, post and send a resume, meet new people and potential employers. <br>  A sense of zero. <br><br>  At the moment I am working in a provider of Internet, telephony and television technical director. <br>  We have a huge potential, but in view of the invalid marketing policy, we are slightly in the pope. <br>  In connection with this, I am very long and hard looking for a new job. <br>  About this this short tale. <br>  You come for an interview to the position of a technical director, and you: ‚ÄúYou know, you are from another industry.  You do not suit us. ‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúWhat nonsense ?,‚Äù I think, ‚ÄúTelecoms!‚Äù  It is always on the edge!  On the one hand the Internet with peering wars, on the other hand - a capricious client. <br>  But it was not there. <br>  In fact, it is different. <br>  You come to the company, which is engaged in international telephony, and everyone is happy that you came! <br>  And all your skills are suitable.  Even more than that - the firm suits you. <br>  But the president of the company says: ‚ÄúYou are not so hot in the development‚Äù <br>  Fine! <br>  We read, we study, we get new acquaintances, and! .. And nothing. <br>  You are no longer a programmer. <br>  Agile you enter at home.  Moreover, you have introduced ITSM long ago. <br>  Those.  in fact, you are a great manager. <br>  Mile Stones, Achievements, etc. you use for work. <br>  But that does not roll. <br>  And it does not roll precisely because you are a manager in your environment. <br>  That is how they explain the reason for the refusal. <br>  But on the other hand - what kind of rigidity can be where sometimes it is necessary <br>  to build a web high-load, and where is the trouble-free backbone network? <br>  It turns out that you need to clearly define not only your positions, but also the positions of who you want to become.

    <h4>  2. The essence. </h4><br>  For example, a company that is a payment system (a-la Qiwi). <br>  Vacancy of the system administrator. <br>  You are not taken for two reasons: <br>  - you are already a tech. <br>  - you are no longer a system.  admin <br>  Let me explain why. <br>  As a manager, you do not stoop to junior padovanov.  Your pad do it for you. <br>  As a sysadmin., You are not quite aware of whether the update has been released for such and such module Nagios / Zabbix / Cacti, which eliminates this or that jamb. <br>  You know that this can be done here.  Or write such a crutch. <br>  But you are not aware of updates. <br>  You have been working with your ‚Äútop managers‚Äù for a long time and just manage the processes. <br>  And most importantly, you are already a manager. <br>  Can you work under someone else? <br><br>  For example, a startup company is launching a mega-game and you are claiming to be a backend developer. <br>  You are not suitable for us, not because you have just solved our ‚Äúmain problem‚Äù, but because you want to grow in our company from the developer into the necessary substitute *. <br><br>  For example, Sale. <br>  A large, huge sale, which has long grown out of itself and has a small Yandex inside. <br>  Joke. <br>  Or not a joke. <br>  Because the whole farm handles the Internet on the subject of product analogs. <br>  Position: team lead group administrators. <br>  Disclaimer: You want to change too much.  We have enough of the fact that the farm barely cope and we do not think to increase capacity. <br><br>  For example, traffic arbitration. <br>  Position: manager of all and all. <br>  Disclaimer: Too cool trying to attract money to the company (here you should ‚ÄúShchitooo ??‚Äù). <br>  Example: Japan;  popular music tracks in Japan;  Russia;  popular resources;  users;  xsud. <br>  Explanation: the office is engaged in traffic arbitration for other offices;  segment: Japan-Russia. <br>  We need a person who can optimize the work of several departments, thereby reducing costs and increasing margins (again, ‚ÄúSchiyito?‚Äù). <br><br><h4>  3. Conclusions and stuff. </h4><br>  There are a lot of examples. <br>  The conclusion is simple. <br>  When you want to change a position, think seven times about how you will live afterwards. <br><br>  Thank. <br><br>  Py.Sy .: sorry for the confusion. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/181147/">https://habr.com/ru/post/181147/</a></p>
