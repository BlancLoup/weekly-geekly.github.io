Want to know the secret about how to turn users who have evaluated your trial version into those who regularly pay?  According to the author of the article, everything is very simple, and the whole secret lies in one word - communication.  And this communication should be properly organized.  How exactly? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It is not enough just to have a well-made website with video tutorials and an extensive knowledge base.  Of course, this is useful, however, you should also find an approach to your users, so that they feel that you are the same person as they are. <br><br>  Now we will talk only about the main points, but let this phrase become your guiding star: <u>‚ÄúPeople want to buy from those whom they trust</u> . <u>‚Äù</u>  One of the ways to build trust with new users is to communicate with them via email, SMS and using push notifications.

      Did you know that 66% of companies that use the free trial model have a conversion rate below 25%.  Why?  Users fall into the Bermuda Triangle in the SaaS realm.  They register for the free version and then disappear without a trace ‚Äî often because the company‚Äôs representatives do not communicate with them. <br><br>  The first three days are the most difficult.  If you motivate the user to actively use your application for three days, he is 4 times more likely to perform the target action. <br><br>  Fortunately, sales and customer support professionals do not need to devote all their time to reach every user.  Just competently using the tools of communication with the user on the basis of his behavior and psychology, as well as the correct text, you can build strong relationships with the client automatically. <br><br>  Let's look at 7 ways to attract paying customers via emails, push notifications and text messages. <br><br>  <u><b>Email</b></u> <br><br>  <i>1. Send a welcome letter</i> <br><br>  Do you know that about 75% of users expect that after registration they will receive a welcome letter?  They are not only interested in your product, but also give permission for you to share information with them. <br><br>  When a user registers for a trial version, automatically send him a welcome letter.  It is important that it be sent within an hour after registration.  90% of potential customers cool down after 60 minutes.  New users can try your service in a hurry and forget about it.  Sending a welcome letter will help build a stronger relationship with them. <br><br>  Try to make your welcome email look like it was sent by a real person.  Use an address to which the user can subsequently reply.  Tell us how often you will send letters.  Be sure to make it clear what the benefits of your service are.  Offer the user assistance if he has any problems (this is a kind of call to action).  Some potential clients may decide to respond to this email - in this case, be sure to continue the dialogue with them. <br><br>  A welcome letter like this will help attract and motivate more users to perform targeted actions: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d3b/ace/aff/d3baceaff3284c6ab27199c497793f5f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Hello [username],</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I noticed that you registered with our service, and just wanted to thank for it.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I would also like to help you get started.</i>  <i>Is there something that you are not sure about or have not fully understood?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I'm always here to help you, here are links to some helpful videos that will help you understand where to start.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Write at any time!</i>  <i>I am always happy to help!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Jill from Autosend.io</i> <br><br>  <i>2. Send e-mails to attract inactive users</i> <br><br>  Send emails to attract inactive users.  For example, 2 days after registration, send us a useful guide or a list of tips on how to start working with your service. <br>  Most users do not work with your application, because they do not know how to do it. <br><br>  A letter built according to this scheme will help to involve inactive users in the process of working with your service: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/789/5c3/2df/7895c32dfc624b8eb8f6e02574d2ad6f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Hello, [username],</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Here are some ways to use our application to help you save money:</i> <i><br></i> <ul><li>  Import bank reports (it will take 2 minutes). </li><li>  Tell us about your favorite stores so that we can get coupons for you (this will take 3 minutes). </li><li>  Tell us about your planned purchases so that we can find the best deals (it will take 5 minutes). </li><li>  If you click here, then set all the necessary settings right now and be able to save your money. </li></ul><br><br>  You can also attract the attention of inactive users with the subject ‚ÄúWe miss you.‚Äù  For example, if a user is not active for two days after registering, remind him what he is missing and what he can get from your application if he returns. <br><br>  <i>Hello, [username],</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Where have you gone?</i>  <i>We have added some new features that you haven't had a chance to try yet.</i>  <i>They can really help you reduce your carbon footprint.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>We added:</i> <i><br></i> <ul><li>  search for recipes that do not include meat, which will help you eat more properly; </li><li>  a public transport card that helps you find another way to get around the city; </li><li>  Search for rental bikes that you can use while traveling. </li></ul><br>  Just click here, sign in, and you can take advantage of all these features in just a few seconds. <br><br>  E-mail should not talk about how great your application.  Your task is to motivate the user to use the service again.  To do this, remind them why they registered and how your application can help them.  Make sure that your letter, designed to return the user, there is a clear call to action.  This should be something that will please the customer and motivate him to return. <br><br>  Good examples of calls to action for writing, the purpose of which is to re-engage a client: <br><ul><li>  create your [product name] now; </li><li>  try it right now; </li><li>  take yours right now; </li><li>  look at it in action; </li><li>  Watch this video now. </li></ul><br><br>  <i>3. Offer to extend the trial period.</i> <br>  No need to offer to extend the trial period for each user.  Those customers who are inactive by the end of the trial period can hardly be persuaded by offering them more time. <br><br>  Extension of the trial period is relevant for the segment of users who are actively working with your application every day during the week, but stop using the service as soon as the trial period ends. <br><br>  Here is an example of a letter that can be sent to active users, offering them to extend the trial period: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/40a/4fb/883/40a4fb8839184ece8b15673a6637cb33.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Hello, [username],</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I noticed that your trial period was over, but you had the opportunity to enjoy our application for a very short time.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Do you want to use the trial version for a few more days?</i>  <i>We will be happy to give you this opportunity.</i>  <i>Just let us know about it.</i> <br><br>  You can also send such users a letter asking for feedback (along with a proposal to extend the trial period).  Pay attention to reviews left - this information can help in increasing the conversion. <br><br>  <u><b>SMS messages</b></u> <br><br>  It may seem to you that there is no point in sending sms to users when you can communicate with them by mail. <br><br>  However, here are two reasons to do this: <br><br><ol><li>  Less competition.  Compared with 1216 e-mails, users receive an average of only 178 sms. </li><li>  Your message is guaranteed to read.  99% of all sms read, and, 90% of them read within three minutes after receipt.  Compare this data with the email opening rate (22%).  Text messaging also has a much higher CTR than e-mails - 19% compared to 4.2%. </li></ol><br><br>  <i>4. Ask users to leave feedback on sms</i> <br><br>  Instead of emails, send sms to inactive users or those who have ended the trial period.  Ask them to provide feedback so you can answer their questions and suggest resources that can help them. <br><br>  When you ask for feedback, be extremely brief and polite.  Here is an example of sms that you can use: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/158/b70/d10/158b70d109bc406c840395fca7328b6b.png" alt="image"><br><br><ul><li>  Thank you for using the [fare name].  Your feedback would be very helpful. </li><li>  Hi, [username], can you take a couple of seconds and leave feedback about [tariff name]? </li><li>  You have the opportunity to speak!  What do you think of [service name]? </li><li>  How can I help you use [fare name] more effectively? </li></ul><br><br>  5. Send sms about unsuccessful payment <br><br>  If you turn a user into a paying customer, you don‚Äôt have to give him up if he doesn‚Äôt get paid  Difficulties in payment occur more often than you think.  In fact, 11-14% of operations simply do not pass (!). <br><br>  The customer may have entered the wrong credit card number.  Or maybe problems with your site.  But maybe the whole thing is that the user used the wrong browser? <br><br>  Whatever it is, send the user an automatic sms if his payment has not passed.  Suggest personally helping the customer to complete the purchase.  You can also send him a link with an alternative payment method. <br><br>  Here are some examples you can use: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a34/1a6/8ea/a341a68eacdb43bdb5319fd2e9b88797.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Hello [username], it looks like there are some problems on the payment page.</i>  <i>Maybe call me and help you with this?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Hello [username], I noticed that you have problems with payment.</i>  <i>Help is needed?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Hello [username], does your payment page work?</i>  <i>If not, let me know and I will be happy to help you complete the operation.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Hi [username], it seems that some problems have occurred on the payment page.</i>  <i>Here is a link to an alternative payment option.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><u>This is the final step.</u></i>  <i><u>Do whatever you want to turn the user into a paying customer, especially if you know what he wants.</u></i> <br><br>  <u><b>Push notifications</b></u> <br><br>  The speed of response to push notifications is three times faster than by email.  If you want to receive answers quickly, use push notifications.  Here are two ideas for increasing conversion with this messaging method. <br><br>  <i>6. Offer a discount</i> <br><br>  Sometimes users go to the page with tariffs, but do not upgrade from a trial version to a paid one.  If this happens to your service, you need to do something.  For example, to offer such users a special discount. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3c0/925/380/3c0925380629416eba40b73004338973.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>We offer you a 25% discount on [fare name] within the next two hours.</i>  <i>Time is limited!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Thinking about becoming our client?</i>  <i>The time has come!</i>  <i>We give you a code with a 20% discount [code number].</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Thanks for the work!</i>  <i>Pay for the use of our service now and get a 25% discount on the promo code [code number].</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  <i>7. Motivate users to complete the trial period.</i> <br><br>  You do not need to wait for the trial version to end so that the customer starts paying.  An active user who likes to use your application will turn into a paying customer faster if you offer him an appropriate incentive.  Remember that users who are actively working with your application for 3 days are 4 times more likely to perform the necessary target action.  Use this feature to turn active users into paying customers as quickly as possible. <br><br>  The incentive you can offer depends on what motivates your users. <br><br>  This can be a discount or upgrade to a premium version of the service at a lower price.  Or provide free, costly advice from an expert who can help the client effectively grow the business. <br><br>  Try sending a push notification like this to motivate users to become paying customers as early as possible: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d5/17a/fe7/2d517afe76e64051b90ffb3b9bb50f2b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>You have the opportunity to save [amount] on our app!</i>  <i>Switch to a more advanced rate with a 10% discount right now.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Like our app?</i>  <i>Upgrade and enjoy more features!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Want to access all features?</i>  <i>Upgrade and get 1 month free!</i> <br><br>  Regardless of what you choose, remember that people like to feel special.  By starting to communicate with them as early as possible, and by doing this as often as possible, you will make them feel part of your team, which will help avoid customer churn. <br><br>  So, what will be the first email, sms or push notification that you send to users?  Have you already used trigger messages to turn as many trial version users as possible into paying customers? <br><br>  We wish you a high conversion! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/243605/">https://habr.com/ru/post/243605/</a></p>
