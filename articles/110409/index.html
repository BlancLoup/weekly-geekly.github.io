  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Chronicles of communities of testers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, there has been an interesting trend - the emergence and development of offline communities of testers in the post-Soviet space (of course, there are communities in India, Great Britain and other countries, but due to their remoteness, they are not considered in this note).  It seems that the flywheel is spinning in the opposite direction, people are returning from the vast expanses of the Internet to offline, and this definitely gives positive results. <br><br>  This article would like to start a small cycle about the communities of testers. <br>  We think that participation in meetings will be useful not only for people testing programs, but also for representatives of many other IT professions.  As practice shows, the most interesting and topical issues are discussed at meetings when they are attended by programmers, analysts, technical writers.  After all, testing is not a self-sufficient process, its task is to provide information to the rest of the project participants.  Therefore, we are always happy when representatives of other professions come to us and we will be even more excited if someone wants to make a presentation. <br><br>  In this article, we will talk about how different tester communities appeared in the CIS countries, what caused them, how they developed and the current state of affairs. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In <b>2003</b> , <a href="http://case.habrahabr.ru/">Slava Pankratov</a> launched the <a href="http://software-testing.ru/">Software-Testing.ru</a> portal.  At the forum at the portal, people discussed topical issues and periodically offered to meet, either coming to a city, or attending a profile conference.

      After several years of communication in the online community, <a href="http://vldcorp.habrahabr.ru/">Vlad Orlikov</a> organized his SQA Days conference.  Yes, yes, those same <a href="http://it-conf.ru/ru/content/294.htm">SQA Days</a> , which have since been held twice a year and collect hundreds of participants, including from near (and not only) foreign countries.  After the first conference, the first offline testers community in Moscow was born.  Some time ago, in connection with the return of Vlad to Minsk, it ceased to function, but was later revived in a new format, which will be described below. <br><br>  At about the same time, in <b>June 2007</b> , their own community of testers began to emerge in Bishkek.  IT-Schnick and all sorts of activities in the field of IT was not enough, there was an information vacuum, and the need to communicate and share experience was.  The organizers were <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/rkononov">Roman Kononov</a> and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/sjukeshov">Samat Zhukeshov</a> .  We started by talking to the IRC channel, a couple of months later the first meeting took place.  Currently, they live mostly offline, their site is not. <br><br>  <b>January 30, 2008</b> was founded the Kharkov Club of Quality Engineers <a href="http://www.qaclub.com.ua/">QA Club</a> .  At the first meeting there was a full house, and still there is no shortage of participants either.  Currently, the club is thriving, and its organizer, <a href="http://vmusiyachenko.moikrug.ru/">Victoria Musiyachenko</a> , creates other communities and platforms for communication. <br><br>  <b>On October 28, 2009</b> , in Moscow at the SQA Days 6 conference, two testers from the northern capital, <a href="http://retverd.habrahabr.ru/">Roman Tverdokhlebov</a> and <a href="http://leshal.habrahabr.ru/">Alexey Lyanguzov</a> , met.  After the conference, returning to the Leningradsky railway station, they decided to gather people to drink beer, to discuss the conference and interesting topics.  It must be said that a similar attempt had already been made in <b>2008</b> , but it was not crowned with success.  The mistakes of the past were taken into account and the meeting took place.  Moreover, over time, from gatherings in the bar, we grew up in the <a href="http://sqagroup.spb.ru/">SPB SQA Group</a> community with regular meetings, at which invited speakers or community members hold seminars, master classes and trainings. <br><br>  Siberian tusovka started at a regional IT conference in <b>May 2010</b> : Testers of DublGIS, dressed up in T-shirts with provocative inscription ‚ÄúNo bugs, checked!‚Äù, Initiated a rally at the flip-chart with an even more provocative slogan ‚ÄúEverything you wanted to know about testing and were afraid to ask "and offered to gather and communicate on professional topics.  This was followed by an informal meeting in one of the pubs of the city, it was the beginning of the Siberian QA community. <br><br>  At the same time on the forum already known to readers at software-testing.ru a branch was created dedicated to the <a href="http://software-testing.ru/forum/topic/17086/">communication of Siberian testers</a> .  Autumn was dedicated to local and metropolitan conferences, bringing to the masses the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa QA party.  The plans - another conference and thematic seminars.  The community has <a href="http://qasib.blogspot.com/">its own blog</a> in which you can read about past events and the impressions of the participants. <br><br>  <b>On June 22, 2010</b> , under the impression of SQA Days 7, the first meeting of Dnepropetrovsk testers, organized by <a href="http://ua.linkedin.com/in/victormalyy">Viktor Maly</a> , <a href="http://ua.linkedin.com/in/katyakameneva">Katya Kameneva</a> and <a href="http://qa-rules.blogspot.com/">Natalia Novotna, was held</a> .  The demand unexpectedly exceeded the supply, and the event had to be moved from the room to the conference room.  Now the <a href="http://dnepr.qacommunity.com.ua/">community is</a> developing, in addition to the seminars they held a test session, in the near future a pre-New Year meeting will take place. <br><br>  Somewhat later, <b>on October 19, 2010</b> , the first meeting of the <a href="http://testing-club.ru/">Moscow club of testers was held</a> (the very resurgent first community).  Its organizer is <a href="http://bfrolov.habrahabr.ru/">Boris Frolov</a> , and the source of inspiration (guess?) Is SQA Days 7. Just as in the case of the Dnepropetrovsk club, there were suddenly more people than could fit into the ordered room, so the registration had to be closed early.  Just the other day, the second meeting took place, at which Slava Pankratov held a workshop on test design, and <a href="http://belonesox.habrahabr.ru/">Stas Fomin</a> (by the way, not a tester, and he never was) told about systems that can help testers <br><br>  At the SQA Days 8 conference, a round table was organized spontaneously during the dinner, at which almost all the aforementioned community organizers, testers from Kazan and Siberia and just sympathizers met.  Shared experiences, ideas, ideas, agreed to keep in touch and help each other. <br><br>  <b>December 16, 2010</b> , after SQA Days 8, simultaneously with the second meeting of the Moscow club, the first meeting of the <a href="http://ap-test-team.blogspot.com/">Kazan</a> Testers <a href="http://ap-test-team.blogspot.com/">community was held</a> .  The organizers, <a href="http://i-lyubin.moikrug.ru/">Igor Lyubin</a> and <a href="http://a-chumagin.moikrug.ru/">Alexey Chumagin</a> (by the way, they were at the fourth meeting of the St. Petersburg community in <b>April 2010</b> ), report that the event turned out to be very relevant and found a lively response among those who had gathered.  So the sequel will be! <br><br>  At the moment there is a <a href="http://sqagroup.spb.ru/communities/">map of regional communities</a> , their <a href="http://software-testing.ru/local-tester-groups">list</a> , enthusiasts in different cities who are planning or are taking the first steps in this direction. <br><br>  Those who wish to help organize local communities in <a href="http://software-testing.ru/forum/topic/17043/">Minsk</a> , <a href="http://game-ts.blogspot.com/2010/12/blog-post.html">Voronezh</a> , <a href="http://www.nn.ru/community/user/testpo/">Nizhny Novgorod</a> , even if you are not testers, feel free to contact enthusiasts, you may become co-organizers or an active core of new clubs or communities, the first speakers.  I also skipped information about attempts to organize communities in Izhevsk and Astana.  For those whose cities have not heard anything yet, there is a great opportunity to take the initiative. <br><br>  Separately, I would like to thank all those people who provided the opportunity for the emergence of such a movement and support!  Thanks you! <br><br>  In the next article, we plan to tell you about the benefits of participation in the communities, and how they help their creators, share the goals and plans of the SPB SQA Group. <br><br>  All questions can be asked in the comments and in personal messages, we will be happy to help! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110409/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110409/</a></p>
