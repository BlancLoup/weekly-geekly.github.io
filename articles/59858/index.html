  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to save on promotion?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Now it is no secret to anyone that for successful promotion in search engines for more or less competitive inquiries can not do without external links. <br>  A small number of links can be obtained naturally and for free, but if you are fighting for some highly competitive word, then without buying links there is no way.  And here already comes to the fore ‚Äúrace of budgets‚Äù. <br>  How, then, from the huge number of sites and pages, choose exactly those that will give the effect?  After all, buying 100 references for the sake of 10 workers is a thankless task, I would even say that it is unprofitable.  And the reasons for ‚Äúthrowing money away to the wind‚Äù are many.  Here are some of them: <br><br>  1) The link is simply <b>not posted</b> for one reason or another.  This can be done as intended (the webmaster deceived you and the system) or by accident (the code broke, the site was not available).  In any case, you, as a buyer, should not be worried about these nuances.  If there is no link, you should not pay money for it! <br>  2) The page where the link was purchased is <b>not indexed by</b> search engines.  There are options, for example, you can buy a link and wait for the robot to go in and remember both the page and the link.  But it could be in a week, a month, a year ...  And all this time, you'll just pay the money ... <br>  3) The site where the link was purchased <b>is located under the</b> search engine <b>filter</b> .  In this case, the page can be indexed, and even your link is visible.  BUT, it will not transfer weight, or it will, but it is so small that there is no sense in it. <br>  4) <b>The parameters of the site</b> where the link was purchased do not correspond to the indicators you need.  For example, TCI and PR = 0, or a huge number of external links.  This situation not only makes the purchase of such a link meaningless, but also potentially dangerous. <br>  5) The site where the link was purchased is <b>glued to another site</b> .  In this case, the site may have good performance, and the pages are indexed, but the use of it is very doubtful. <br>  6) The site is good, the link is placed, the page is indexed, but the search engines do <b>not see it</b> (checked through the webmaster panel).  It should be understood that the operation of the algorithm of robots is completely unknown, and it is not always possible to explain why two identical pages work differently.  Therefore, if the link is, and through the webmaster's panel it is not visible - most likely the purchase of such pages is just as meaningless. <br><br>  You can write a dozen more reasons why money for buying links is wasted.  Of course, all these parameters are easy to check directly through search engines or with the help of special toolbars.  But if you have such pages for analysis not 10, but, say 100?  And 1000?  ...  And the main problem: links to pages should be checked not only before the purchase, but also after, with a certain frequency, because  indexed pages ‚Äúfall out‚Äù of the index, and purchased links may not be indexed ... <br>  For such purposes there are several options for checking, but from our point of view, the most convenient is one of the services of Seolib.ru, in the arsenal of which there are two convenient tools: <br>  - <b>Analysis of purchase links</b> (description: <a href="http://www.seolib.ru/script/extlinfo/">www.seolib.ru/script/extlinfo</a> ) <br>  - <b>Automatic link analysis (+ link analysis from Sape).</b>  (http://www.seolib.ru/help/sape/) <br>  The difference between these scripts is that the first allows you to check one-time pages and links that interest you.  The second one - does a similar analysis automatically with a specified frequency (daily, weekly).  Another advantage is that for analysis you can export your projects from the largest link exchange Sape.ru, for the analysis of already purchased links. <br>  The analysis is performed on the following indicators: <br>  -indexing pages in Yandex and Google <br>  - the presence of the Yandex filter "you are the last"; <br>  - Check for a virus in Google; <br>  - analysis of the number of external and internal links; <br>  - information about the CY and PR pages; <br>  - Page response and error message (404, 403 ...); <br>  - check the presence of links on the page; <br>  - check the visibility of links Yandex and Google; <br>  - Visibility links in Yandex.Webmaster

      Savings strategy usually consists of the following steps: <br>  1. First you select the pages on which you would like to buy links.  Immediately select pages with a margin of 40-60 percent. <br>  2. Then, through the manual analysis of the purchase links, analyze the pages for indexability, the number of external and internal links, TCI and the PR. <br>  3. From the first array, select only those that are suitable for indicators and indexed. <br>  4. Buy links to them. <br>  5. A week later, run an automatic analysis of purchased links.  Moreover, if you bought them through the Sape system, you can completely export your project with all the pages and prices.  This is convenient because  if there is a suspicious page, the price can play a decisive role - whether or not to leave such a link. <br>  6. At least once a week to conduct such an analysis of purchased links and discard non-working.  Under the words to carry out the analysis, we mean not to independently check all indicators, since  the system will do it for you.  You will need to simply delete unnecessary links. <br><br><img src="http://www.galleries.com.ua/My-gif/sape1.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  The cost of such a service is quite acceptable: 0.001 USD  for checking 1 links.  In other words, for the analysis of 1000 links you will pay only 1 cu, which is quite acceptable, given that the average link costs from 0.05 to 0.25 cu, i.e.  link analysis will take about 0.6% of the budget value.  And the potential savings: from 30 to 50% of the total reference budget). <br>  <a href="http://www.seolib.ru/">www.seolib.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/59858/">https://habr.com/ru/post/59858/</a></p>
