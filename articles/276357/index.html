Like any baby who is only three months old, he is lost against the background of more senior comrades.  And one can only guess what he will become when he grows up and strengthens.  However, like every baby, our browser has parents.  Among them is our team, which is responsible for the <a href="http://xn--h1aehhjhg.xn--d1acj3b/">Children's regime</a> in the project.  And we would like to tell you what and why we wanted to do, what we did not have time to finish yet and how we plan to develop the project further. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/39c/1a3/ebb/39c1a3ebb62f407692db9d311a9ab4eb.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>IDEA</b> <br><br>  In our company, as is the case in IT, mostly young and family people work, and many of them already have young children.  Being engaged in a family filter in a big search, we often heard requests from colleagues and our users: they say, search is a search, but if children leave one-on-one with a computer, they start poking at any links that come up.  And, naturally, they find such ... SUCH, CARL !!!  It seems clear what.  Not to mention the fact that sometimes the computer itself stops working normally.

      It is clear that in our century, hundreds of programs have been written for parental control, and perhaps even more programs for filtering inappropriate content.  As a rule, they are implemented either as extensions, traffic control programs, or DNS servers.  Each of these solutions has its pros and cons, especially for those who have already tried to work with them.  As a rule, one thing unites them - very few people use them!  It turned out that such parents, who used extensions, or even know about the existence of programs that filter content, are not just a minority, they can be literally counted on fingers. <br><br>  <b>STUDY</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/01c/0f7/397/01c0f7397c804aebbe4944843142b9c6.jpg"><br>  To test our hypotheses and improve the defense mechanisms of our services, we turned to the sociologists of the <a href="http://fom.ru/">Public Opinion</a> Foundation.  In the course of the study, parents whose children use the Internet were asked what the Internet seemed to them to be safe for the child, and what did not.  And the results showed how naive adults are in assessing their children.  For example, parents of undergraduates (under 10 years old) think that their children ‚Äúon these your Internet sites‚Äù do not do anything except entertainment.  That, in general, almost corresponds to the truth.  But the parents of older children are confident that in adolescence in the first place goes ... study.  That is, a teenager at the age of 13-15 years at the computer, in their opinion, writes essays.  At the same time, the absolute majority - 94% of parents - believe that adults should keep track of which sites their children visit.  49% of respondents explain this by the fact that the Internet has a lot of harmful information that is not designed for children.  And at the same time (we got to the most important) only 17% (!) Use some programs, settings and special modes in order to protect children. <br><br>  In general, after the study, we realized that the educational program and protection tools are needed not only for children, but also for their parents.  Moreover, very few are able to create conditions for safe work in the network: only 12% (!) Of the surveyed parents use firewalls, 9% use special software for parental control, 5% include family or children's search mode on the Web 4% activate a special mode from the Internet provider.  Well at least antivirus is on the PC in 63% of families.  But even this figure is depressing, to be honest. <br><br>  Having studied all this, we decided to make some very simple mechanism, simple and understandable for parents, not requiring any additional steps from them.  Increasingly, the media is talking and writing about the concept of "digital hygiene", but it will remain so, while the means to ensure it will be more complicated than a conventional toothbrush.  And it seemed to us quite harmonious to transfer the toolkit for the protection of children's stay in the network directly to the browser.  Not even that.  We decided to make it an integral part of the browser.  This leaves the opportunity to use those technologies that already exist, and gives a lot of space for the implementation of new security tools.  Whatever you say, namely, the browser is the very point through which the child gets acquainted with the Internet. <br><br>  <b>THE FIRST STEPS</b> <br><br>  The first steps to implement the idea were quite obvious.  To begin, we decided to make separate profiles for adults and children.  A separate profile for the child is an important thing.  Having put ourselves in the place of the child, we realized that, as in real life, we need to keep away from the kids matches, sockets and lighters.  Therefore, in the children's profile, the possibilities to change the settings, put new extensions, go back to normal mode were lost. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/341/acc/585/341acc585b2d4e1f8d52cb03d8b502fa.png"><br><br>  Having made a separate children's profile, we thus created for the child a separate space in the browser - the ‚Äúplayground‚Äù, which now had to be furnished and secured against all sorts of harmful and dangerous things.  There was little time to arrange the ‚Äúnursery‚Äù, so first of all we decided to take advantage of the search.  There, a family filter has long been registered, reworked and removed from search 2 billion pages with dangerous content, and themed pages for different categories - not very bad.  Therefore, it seemed to us logical to transfer the work done from the search to the browser, and build on them the first bastion of security.  But it turned out - it seemed to us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/79d/871/413/79d87141395c4b68ac192919318d8274.png"><br><br>  There were too many pitfalls during the transfer.  But the main problem was that the search and the browser had completely different usage patterns.  The search knows only those documents that it downloads and indexes.  But the browser is just like spacewalk.  This is where the devil lies.  The child, clicking on the links, goes where they lead him.  As a result, he visits websites regardless of whether we know this page or not, whether we checked it or not, whether it is dangerous or not. <br><br>  All this forced us to go in two ways: pumping up bad sites, thereby replenishing the base of bad sites, and prohibiting the child from visiting those pages that we have not yet had time to check.  The search is a kind of bottleneck, through which, it turned out, the easiest way to control and filter the issuance of results.  Therefore, when switching to Children's mode, the child is placed on the search engine <a href="http://xn--h1aehhjhg.xn--d1acj3b/">Sputnik.deti</a> , the search for which is a collection of children's websites in the .RU segment.  They are searched and found by automatic search robots and <a href="http://www.sputnik.ru/">Sputnik</a> analyzers.  The database also includes sites selected by the project partners: Kaspersky Lab, Netoscope project, Roskomnadzor and other companies.  Any resource is tested by our search assessors and security system.  At the start, there were more than 5 thousand sites in the database, half of them are portals of schools, the rest are developing and entertaining content.  Yes, there are few sites yet, but we are constantly adding to their number.  In fact, any owner or representative of an online project for children can take part in the development of the service - it‚Äôs enough to suggest your site to be added to the search area.  (By the way, offer your options for children's sites! Satellite. Children / about).  We decided that it would be better for the child not to visit any good site, but then we minimize the opportunity to look at something bad.  It must be admitted that there are indeed very few children's websites on the Runet, and the next task in this direction is filling the database with resources that are not specifically childish, but will be interesting and useful for children. <br><br>  <b>RELEASE</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b77/0d1/1be/b770d11be02c47d5afef9b2a1133dec1.png"><br><br>  It is with this tool we came out in release.  In the Children's mode, we try to prevent the child from getting to sites with bad content, while trying to minimize the number of errors on the good ones.  Do not forget that in the Children's mode the Advertiser also works, in it the default mode is enabled by default.  But if you want, you can include strict.  As practice shows, there is a bit of advertising on children's websites, a maximum of 2-3 blocks about similar games or services.  And when strict mode is on, they will all be blocked. <br><br>  We understand that as the project grows, the number of associated problems will grow.  Any system working with big data, subjecting, quality increases only with time, accumulating user experience for self-learning and improvement of algorithms.  For faster development always need a quick accumulation of experience.  The fastest way is feedback from the user.  Of course, there is a risk that negative feedback will affect the reputation of the product.  However, we decided to follow this path, which will help us overcome growth problems more quickly, and parents will be able to take advantage of the current level of browser protection and the solutions they used before.  And with each feedback received ‚Äî bad or good ‚Äî we are getting better.  On this, perhaps, everything to start.  We promise not to be limited to this introductory article, and we will try to make a whole series of materials about our technologies such as Advertiser and Stalker, how we work with Big Data, how the DataMining process is built, as well as about our map service and our mobile products. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/276357/">https://habr.com/ru/post/276357/</a></p>
