In today's final publication, we want to bring to your attention various interesting study events that we have prepared for the audience. <br><br>  <b>PostgreSQL training for PG Day'17 Russia</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/720/493/e7f/720493e7ff82e0cb5f3fa86bc1051eb8.png" alt="image" align="left" width="120">  <b>Alexey Lesovsky</b> , our permanent speaker, a DBA with many years of experience, one of the leading experts of Data Egret, will present a master class <b><a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/papers/118%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dprogram2">on setting up a Posgres for Linux</a></b> .  Alexey is one of the leading experts in system administration of the Posgres and the surrounding infrastructure. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In his training, Alexey collected a wealth of information on how to configure PostgreSQL and hardware along with the operating system for optimal performance.  Will consider the numerous components and their configuration.  Separately, the methods of diagnosing and troubleshooting the operating system and Postgres itself will be studied.

Alexey has been involved in the implementation of 1C solutions in domestic business for many years, conducting trainings and training seminars on the development, administration and construction of technical processes. <br><br>  The task of this master class is to teach you to effectively diagnose problems with the performance of the tool and to take effective steps to eliminate them.  Especially for you, Alexey will review the necessary software and the order of its use, will talk about typical scenarios of 1C behavior and their display using pgBadger, will give recommendations on diagnosing and debugging problematic queries, and also explain what influence the versions of the platform and PG have on the stability " production ".  Just the other day we published a <b><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/pgdayrussia/blog/331448/">detailed interview</a></b> with Alexey, in which he tells in detail about the planned training. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8eb/160/e43/8eb160e43b0884e14599aadd87d1ba9e.png" alt="image" align="left" width="120"><br>  Ivan Frolkov, an expert at Postgres Professional, <b><a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/papers/131%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dprogram2">will talk about the capabilities of Postgres Pro Enterprise</a></b> , the domestic fork of PostgreSQL, intended for use in large businesses and state-owned companies, namely, autonomous transactions, distributed master, adaptive query scheduling, and many other features of Postgres Pro Enterprise, explain the differences assemblies from the "vanilla" version and will offer numerous examples of the use of new "features" in everyday development tasks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b18/f89/41e/b18f8941e0d98625a0b62cb17e48aa65.png" alt="image" align="right" width="120">  <a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/papers/173%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dprogram2"><b>Java and PostgreSQL: the secrets of high performance</b></a> are not a master class, but a real rock concert.  World stars will come especially for you: <b>Dave Cramer</b> , creator of the JDBC driver for PostgreSQL, and <b>√Ålvaro Hernandez Tortosa</b> , a Java expert and contributor to JDBC.  Together with <b>Vladimir Sitnikov</b> , one of the most active contributors to the pgjdbc project, colleagues will spend the whole day telling and showing tricks and techniques of JDBC &amp; pgjdbc.  Master classes with speakers of this level are extremely rare things, but we have tried especially for you and managed to gather these three coolest specialists under one roof so that they could share their experience.  <b>Only practice, only Java, only hardcore!</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/142/cc7/f8c/142cc7f8c115d119b6cd3e8a723beab7.png" alt="image" align="left" width="120">  Perhaps the most interesting event on monitoring will be a practical master class <b><a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/papers/134%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dprogram2">Monitor PostgreSQL with the Elastic Stack</a></b> by Philip Crenna (Philipp Krenn), an engineer at Elastic.  Everyone knows how to use the Elastic Stack to aggregate logs, but not everyone knows how to use this toolkit to effectively monitor the state of PostgreSQL, collect the necessary metrics, analyze logs and monitor queries performed.  During the 4-hour workshop you can build such a tool under the strict guidance of Phillip to teach you all this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ae/2b8/598/2ae2b8598cb69e949e7e4600b6f402ae.png" alt="image" align="left" width="120">  What to do if you are a system administrator or a DevOps engineer, you do not have a DBA in your team, and the Postgres is heavily used in the project?  Ilya Kosmodemyansky, the founder of DBA Data Egret, will help to survive in this situation.  Ilya has prepared for you a <b><a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/papers/188%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dprogram2">master class on survival in difficult conditions</a></b> .  System administrators and DevOps often encounter a problem ‚Äî there is no dedicated database administrator on the project, and PostgreSQL is increasingly ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù as the load grows. <br><br>  In one academic day, Ilya will briefly tell the maximum amount of knowledge about the PostgreSQL DBMS, necessary and sufficient to start using it tomorrow and not repeating well-known errors.  In this course there will be no excess of theory - it is not enough for some admin to really know the subtleties of the B + -tree device or to navigate in a variety of normal forms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b19/829/758/b19829758457929f55781f3526dcf05c.png" alt="image" align="left" width="200">  And, of course, two excellent master classes are devoted to MySQL performance: the <b><a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/papers/163%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dprogram2">architecture and performance optimization of InnoDB by</a></b> Peter Zaitsev and the <b><a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/papers/129%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dprogram2">debugging of MySQL performance by</a></b> Sveta Smirnova.  In preparation for these large-scale events, we interviewed Peter and Sveta.  Be sure <b><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/pgdayrussia/blog/330716/">to</a></b> <b><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/pgdayrussia/blog/330520/">read</a></b> <b><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/pgdayrussia/blog/330716/">them</a></b> . <br><br>  <b>Computer science at PG Day'17 Russia</b> <br><br>  Teaching theories at a conference that is attended mainly by practitioners is not an easy task.  The vast majority of modern specialists in DBMS look at things purely from a practical point of view.  Such a tendency was formed for a reason - we all have to work in the limitations that form modern databases.  Nevertheless, it is sometimes useful to take a step back, assess the current situation and understand which fundamentally new ways to solve a problem are possible? <br><br>  This year we decided to take a chance by organizing a section on the more theoretical aspects of modern database science. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/51c/dac/48a/51cdac48a0ca29d8304daeb92dcfd7cb.png" alt="image" align="left" width="120">  <b>Viktor Leis</b> , Ph.D. and professor at the Munich University of Technology, will come to share his experience with you.  Victor's scientific career is devoted to the processing of requests, competitive access, data storage and other pressing problems of data warehouses.  In his <a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/papers/215%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dprogram2"><b>report,</b></a> Victor will talk about research in query optimization and compiling queries into machine code, which formed the basis of his doctoral dissertation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/988/c98/867/988c988673bba82aa7029267b5bbdd71.png" alt="image" align="left" width="120">  <b>Andrei Nikolayenko</b> , IBS Systems Architect, will offer you an <a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/papers/205%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dprogram2"><b>overview of the</b></a> main benchmark benchmarks for DBMS performance in a historical perspective, with a focus on the current state in the face of changing typical loads and the emergence of new DBMS classes. <br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/555/531/955/555531955a37b528499e3c160c6739b3.png" alt="image" align="left" width="120"><br>  <b>Artem Barger</b> , an employee of the IBM research team, an expert in building distributed industrial systems, will hold a two-hour seminar on the development of distributed cryptocurrency on the example of the HyperLedger project.  HyperLedger is an open initiative aimed at creating a scalable distributed blockchain infrastructure.  The seminar will be divided into two sections.  <b><a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/papers/192%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dprogram2">The theoretical part is</a></b> devoted to the issues of architecture, organization and the concept of blockchain.  In the <b><a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/papers/207%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dprogram2">practical part,</a></b> students will learn about the HyperLedger project API and get acquainted with the example of performing various operations that form the foundation for the functioning of a distributed database. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/266/38a/58d/26638a58db2c138d75840834b52cd310.png" alt="image" align="left" width="120">  The section will be moderated by <b>Evgeny Morgunov</b> , Ph.D., associate professor of the Computer Science and Computer Engineering Department of the Siberian State Aerospace University.  Eugene will also present to the audience a <a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/papers/194%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dprogram2"><b>review of the Data Envelopment Analysis methodology</b></a> for an empirical assessment of the performance of database specialists. <br><br>  Looking forward to seeing everyone next week in St. Petersburg!  <b><a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/request/registration%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dprogram2">Registration will be open</a></b> until the start of the event. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/331722/">https://habr.com/ru/post/331722/</a></p>
