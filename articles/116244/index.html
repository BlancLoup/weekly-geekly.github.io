Last night, I finally brought my small just-for-fun project to the usable state - <a href="http://godkillskitten.com/">http://godkillskitten.com</a> . <br><br>  In short, this is a site where everyone can publish small critical notes about things that many people do day after day, not realizing that they are not doing very well.  After the publication of the note, the author immediately receives a link that can be shared with his "muse", or simply posted in a prominent place somewhere on the Internet.  Good notes after consideration by the moderator are available on the main page of the site, average ones live for one month and are available at a link known to the author, only frankly bad ones are deleted. <br><br>  Yes, more notes can be printed and hung on the wall <strike>in the accounting</strike> .

      The project will be useful to a wide range of people - system administrators, support and support staff, programmers, motorists, teachers - in general, everyone who wants (and can) make the world a little better.  :) <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  How it all began </h4><br>  Once upon a time, the 100,500th letter received with the subject ‚Äú <i>On: Re: On: Re: On: Re: Urgently send a report !!</i>  ‚ÄùAnd with the text that had no perfect relation to the report sent six months ago, I decided that I had to do something about it.  The personal explanation to the addressee is not our method (such letters, unfortunately, come from many people), so <a href="http://else.if.ua/2011/01/tema-pisma-eto-vazhno/">this</a> post <b>*</b> was written in my personal blog, and for a while I added links to it to the answers to some letters. <br><br>  You know, it helped.  I was pleasantly surprised - instead of letters with the subject ‚Äú <i>Fwd: Bring to the attention of employees,</i> ‚Äù letters began to come in ‚Äú <i>Fwd: Changes in the collective agreement</i> ‚Äù, well, all these ‚Äú <i>Re: Re: Re: ...</i> ‚Äù became significantly less.  In addition, an analysis of site attendance statistics showed that the post is very popular. <br><br>  At first there was the idea to continue the cycle of publications on this topic in the blog, but she lost to another idea - to make a separate resource, where everyone can speak in a similar way.  Launched NetBeans. <br><br><h4>  How is it done </h4><br>  The task of creating a site with the functionality I need is, on the one hand, quite simple, because the amount of functionality itself is very modest, on the other hand, too specific to fit into some standard solutions like CMS (due to the lack of user registration, for example) .  The ideal option would be to use some kind of good framework, but once again assessing the scope of work, I came to the conclusion that I would still be able to solve this problem faster with the help of my own samopisny PHP micro-framework (MVC).  I'm not sure now of the correctness of this choice, since the estimated timing of the project‚Äôs implementation eventually resulted in t √ó Pi, but what‚Äôs done is done.  Especially because the fun of writing their bikes is still much more than from studying Zend manuals.  :) <br><br>  Under this project, classes for working with bit.ly, creating a sitemap, and RSS are created from scratch, is simple and very interesting, and I got a lot of fun in the process.  The most interesting task, perhaps, is the implementation of ratings - I did not want to limit the possibility of voting for a note to one IP-address, but at the same time I had to somehow protect myself against cheating.  Yes, I understand that this is not necessary for anyone, but - a matter of principle.  Details of the decision for obvious reasons, I will not describe here, but there is some reason to believe that it will still work. <br><br>  Very useful experience was the observation of the consequences of defects in usability - users were not clear that their texts will be displayed within a specific template, so 90% of publications required editing.  Adding a sample form to the fields has largely eliminated this problem. <br><br><h4>  What's next </h4><br>  The plans for the near future - the organization of the broadcast of new entries in Twitter and LiveJournal.  If the project arouses interest and will be popular, I will make it the Ukrainian version (most of the entries can be ‚Äúsynchronized‚Äù between the Russian and Ukrainian sites, making the translation). <br><br>  Of course, I would also like to put in order the visual and textual design of the site - I am not a designer or a writer, because their quality makes you want something better.  But here, alas, I cannot cope without the help of specialized specialists - if someone is willing to participate, I would be very glad to cooperate. <br><br>  Save the kitten - share your worldly wisdom!  :) <br><br>  <i><b>*</b> The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe question form was inspired by the once-popular demotivator. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Every_time_you_masturbate..._God_kills_a_kitten">Every time you masturbate ... God kills a kitten</a></i> <br><br>  <b>Upd .:</b> I would love to bring all the entries that appeared after the publication of this post to the main page of the project, if you left more detailed explanations to them (‚ÄúBecause‚Ä¶‚Äù field).  The options ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs bad,‚Äù ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs not possible‚Äù and ‚Äúbecause only asshole do it this way‚Äù √± don‚Äôt roll a bit, I would like something more substantiated, clever, and, if possible, good.  :) I see that you have to think thoroughly over the rules and user agreement. <br><br>  <b>Upd 2. .:</b> Habraeffekt.  :( I decide with a support question about the upgrade of VPS resources. I had to remove the topic from the main one, I apologize. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116244/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116244/</a></p>
