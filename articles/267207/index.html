  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Wooden" data center group Inoventica</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Inoventica data center is located in Sudogodsky district of the Vladimir region and is the first cloud-based data center of the Inoventica Group.  Put into commercial operation in February 2012. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e6/3f1/8c7/6e63f18c7f72484dbf0352e06705bf7f.jpg"></div><br>  The data center has the following advantages: <br><br><ul><li>  Modern high quality equipment from HP; </li><li>  Throughput up to 40 Tbps; </li><li>  Channel width is 10 Gbps and 1 Gbps; </li><li>  24-hour technical support. </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The optimal structure of capital investments during the construction of the first Inoventica data center was achieved through the use of innovative technological solutions (the use of a cooling system based on free-cooling technology and the availability of a remote monitoring and infrastructure management system), as well as an automatic service management system.  The data center was built in record time - six months, despite the fact that general construction work was completed in 90 days.  Minimization of operating costs at the stage of commercial operation of the data center is achieved through its integration into a dual-use facility - a recreational and recreation complex.  Because of the need to comply with the uniform eco-style of all the buildings of the data center complex, it acquired a unique design and name - the world's first ‚Äúwooden‚Äù data center.

The same indicators can boast the largest players in the Internet market, such as Google, Facebook, Yahoo. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c65/342/f9c/c65342f9c6e449338316623fc4dc8b55.jpg"></div><br>  Although there are fire extinguishers and fire alarms in the data center, and the complex has its own fire engine, we deliberately refused to install a gas fire extinguishing system.  Such a system is required by Tier specifications, but it is not needed to comply with GOST.  Since servers are our property and insured, we don‚Äôt have a goal to save them at any cost. <br><br>  As server hardware, we mainly use servers manufactured by Hewlett-Packard, and Supermicro of various configurations.  For the organization of high-performance and fault-tolerant data warehouses are used products of the company Hewlett-Packard (3PAR). <br><br>  In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that the use of innovative technologies by our company in cooling and scrupulous attitude to all the details when implementing the data center allows us not only to provide services at a competitive price, but also to offer our customers the most environmentally friendly IT services in Russia. <cut></cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/267207/">https://habr.com/ru/post/267207/</a></p>
