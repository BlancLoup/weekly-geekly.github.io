  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yandex and the Higher School of Economics open the Computer Science faculty</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Computer science is developing so rapidly that classical education simply does not have time for it.  Meanwhile, the need for specialists in the field of Computer Science is now enormous.  Together with the Higher School of Economics, we want to create a faculty where people can get a full-fledged higher education in this area.  He will train specialists in the ‚ÄúTheoretical and Applied Informatics‚Äù and ‚ÄúSoftware Engineering‚Äù programs.  Classes will begin in September this year. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/yandex/blog/217981/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b6f/f99/de3/b6ff99de390f4c01ab9ae22e135b34ba.png"></a> <br><br>  The new faculty of computer science is the ‚Äúbig‚Äù faculty.  In the Higher School of Economics, the so-called structural associations are responsible for the whole subject area.  He will unite the department of software engineering, as well as the department of applied mathematics and computer science, which already existed at the Higher School of Economics.  They will add a new department - big data and information retrieval.  It will be created on the basis of the basic department of Yandex, which has been working at HSE since 2008.  The curriculum of the faculty is created jointly by university lecturers and Yandex specialists.  It will include courses in machine learning, computer vision, Big Data and other areas of computer science.  Lectures and seminars will be conducted by HSE teachers, Yandex staff and teachers of the School for Data Analysis. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It is assumed that as a result of the training, students will receive both the entire set of professional skills of a programmer and deep knowledge of fundamental mathematics.  Starting from senior courses, they will be able to choose one of the areas of modern computer science for themselves and either dive into academic science or try themselves in practical work.  There will be several directions in the master's program, including the program of the basic department of Yandex - ‚ÄúInternet data analysis‚Äù.

      The faculty will be undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate.  Classes will begin in September.  In 2014, 180 people will be credited to budget places.  It is also possible training on a fee basis.  Upon admission, the results of the USE in mathematics, computer science and the Russian language, as well as the results of mathematics and computer science competitions will be taken into account.  Graduates will receive state diplomas. <br><br>  The Dean of the Faculty will be Ivan Arzhantsev, Doctor of Physics and Mathematics, who previously led Yandex‚Äôs educational projects.  The head of the educational program in the undergraduate program will be Anton Konushin, Ph.D. in Physics and Mathematics, Assistant Professor VMK MSU. <br><br>  HSE already ranks fourth among research institutes and universities in the number of publications in the ‚ÄúInformation Technologies‚Äù direction.  Together with the HSE, we want to create a world-class Computer Science department.  We are sure that its graduates will be in demand both in science and in IT companies. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/217981/">https://habr.com/ru/post/217981/</a></p>
