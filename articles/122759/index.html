  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Virtual Publishing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This article is caused by reflections after reading these two topics here: " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/books/122666/">Publishing World</a> " and " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/internet/122550/">JK Rowling will sell electronic versions of the Harry Potter books</a> ."  I am very, very happy that sales of e-books on Amazon have exceeded the number of printed ones.  But read articles directly and logically follows the unpreparedness of the existing infrastructure for the development of electronic book publishing.  And I had a question - what exactly is stopping? <br><br>  In my opinion, at the moment all the necessary technologies have already been created to ensure the interaction of all the necessary chains in the field of book publishing (as in music) from idea to sale in the online store.  It remains only to see it and do it. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  I am not a programmer and I don‚Äôt represent the amount of work needed for the implementation of the ‚Äúvirtual publishing‚Äù project (let's call it that way), but I believe that this project is very, very much in demand. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      What, in my opinion, should be: <br><br>  It should be a professional network (similar to a social one), where all the necessary specialists could dynamically create groups to create a literary work, lead a project within this group, almost instantly involve additional specialists on the same resource, publish and go about their business after end of the project. <br><br>  For example, I am a writer.  I registered in the system, went to the ‚ÄúEditors‚Äù section, selected several candidates (by rating), sent them suggestions, held talks there and if yes, I included them in the group.  In the same way, artists, proofreaders, translators, promoters and anyone else, if it is associated with the publishing business, are searched.  The work proceeds on the same principle as group programming projects are being done.  After the project is completed - click the ‚Äúpublish‚Äù button, and that's it.  You are already a published writer. <br><br>  Further members of the group can leave feedback about each other, rating (for determining ratings). <br><br>  Additionally, in the same resource, it probably makes sense to make a calculation system.  It is especially useful if the group was originally created on the basis of revenue sharing.  The system should itself receive revenue from sales and distribute among the participants in accordance with the agreements. <br><br>  The financial system can also be taken into account when drawing up a specialist rating. <br><br>  By the way, you can separately provide a specialized section for communication with readers (maybe something in the form of a forum or Support system).  You can not throw consumers after publication. <br><br>  Pages of fan groups. <br><br>  In general, a social network, but sharpened by a business task. <br><br>  The system itself should take a small percentage of those who will sell the final product (that is, do it in a closed group).  In the case of an open creation, the condition for the rights to the final product should be only a free license.  The ability to create in open mode will be used by the authors themselves as advertising and as a system for popularizing the resource and attracting visitors. <br><br>  A similar problem at the moment and the musicians.  After all, even a good poet or musician cannot find each other.  When found, they need a composer, an arranger.  They might need a flutist.  It would not be bad all in one place and in a convenient form. <br><br>  Automatically provide all authors with a protection service, such as DRM-free, which allows you to track every copy. <br><br>  You can sell finished products directly from this site (why do we need Amazon or iTunes). <br><br>  I do not declare the creation of a new startup.  These are just thoughts. And this section seemed to me the most suitable for this publication. <br><br>  This article is my first on Habr√©, please do not judge strictly. <br><br>  PS I may not be very specific in expressing my vision of how the search for specialists should occur.  So I clarify the idea - as on the stock exchange.  I needed an artist, for example - I put a tick, pressed a button and got a list of artists with a rating.  Everything is online.  And if it suits me, then I included it in the project again with one click of a button.  A project is something like SourceForge. <br>  And likewise, if a free artist wants to find a job - welcome to the stock exchange or auction.  Most of all, when looking for a specialist, it is annoying to see an infinite number of resumes.  I just want to have some kind of rating, some points.  And the price of a specialist should be based on the rating and quantity on the market. <br>  By the way, the desire to earn a rating will serve as an incentive to participate in certain image, free projects. <br><br>  I repeat once again that these are only thoughts.  I wanted to get some kind of discussion, and not links to other sites or expressions like: ‚ÄúThere is already and a cart with a horse works reliably, why make a car‚Äù.  Yes, then, that life is development. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122759/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122759/</a></p>
