  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"The Case of Pirate" Lineage "": how it will be</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In due time on Habr√© <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/Dura_Lex/86165/">it was reported</a> about withdrawal of several Lineage game servers.  And now, Kommersant has <a href="http://kommersant.ru/doc.aspx%3FDocsID%3D1341997">found out</a> that the seizures were carried out in criminal cases.  As written in the note, "this is the first time in the history of the spread in Russia Lineage 2 and only the third in the history of online role-playing games." <br>  I don‚Äôt know about the second case, but I watched the first one closely.  Knowing our judicial system, I will try to slightly predict the development of events in the case of the ‚Äúruler‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="http://www.duralex.org/category/dela/ragnarok/">The first case of the "pirated online game"</a> was initiated upon the operation of the server Ragnarok online.  Of course, no piracy was there even close: on the server worked the game emulator, written by enthusiasts on their own.  In the States, the developers of the original Ragnarok tried to drive these enthusiasts, but did not succeed.  In Russia, they were more fortunate. <br>  Maybe you think that the investigation has appointed an examination of the server parts, original and samopisny, found that they are different, and this calmed down?  Well, it appointed an examination, and the entire Runet with ecstasy read out a <a href="http://www.duralex.org/2007/05/31/novosti-kompyuternoy-ekspertizyi/">passage from this examination</a> : <br><br>  <i>"The table of the program" Microsoft Excel ".</i>  <i>In this table, the comparison was as follows.</i>  <i>The contents of the file of one program, in the form in which it is presented in the dialog box of the ‚ÄúUltraCompare‚Äù program panel, were copied and transferred to one column of the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.</i>  <i>In the adjacent column of the same tabular sheet were transferred supposedly coinciding data from the same file of another program.</i>  <i>At the same time, Microsoft Excel automatically distributes the text to the cells of the table, taking into account the tabs placed in the text, that is, the text in both columns of the table will be equally divided only if the tabs of both texts are the same.</i>  <i>Then, in the cells of the third column of the table containing the data of the files of both programs, the ‚ÄúCOBPAD‚Äù function was inserted from among the built-in functions of the Microsoft Excel program.</i>  <i>This function checks the identity of the contents of the cells of a table containing two texts and returns the value TRUE if the contents of the cells match, or FALSE if the contents of the cells do not match.</i>  <i>this comparison takes into account the sequence of characters, the order of placement of punctuation marks, the number of spaces, the placement of tabs, uppercase and lowercase letters, that is, the TRUE value can be obtained only if the contents of the compared cells completely coincide.</i>  <i>Full coincidence of the table cells indicates that the contents of the compared files are completely identical, that is, the files themselves are the same (the files ‚Äúbinkw32.dll‚Äù, ‚Äúcps.dll‚Äù, ‚Äúdbghelp.dll‚Äù, ‚Äúgranny2‚Äù were checked in the same way. dll "," ijl15.dll "," mp3dec.asj "," mss32.dll "and" mssfast.m3d "available in the file structure of both programs).</i>  <i>Also, these files were listened to using the ‚ÄúWinAmp‚Äù program and I can only confirm that these files are also identical in hearing, the music is played using the same instruments (voices) in the same key and in the same rhythm. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Have you tried to compare dll-files with Microsoft Excel?  But the experts of the State Unitary Enterprise Informzaschita tried it, and they did it.  The full text of the examination is <a href="http://www.duralex.org/2007/06/05/delo-o-pohischennom-servere/">here</a> . <br>  So, the expert found the client part of ‚ÄúRagnarok‚Äù on the withdrawn server, compared it with the Russian client part, and came to the conclusion that it was changed in a pirated way.  No wonder: it really was a different program.  "Expert" compared different versions of customers. <br>  Then there was a court, which, in its verdict, did not notice that the examination was, in fact, about various programs.  Or rather, he remarked - and wrote in the <a href="http://www.duralex.org/2007/06/07/delo-o-pohischennom-servere-prigovor/">verdict</a> that ‚Äúthe client part of the program worked as a server‚Äù.  The position of the ‚Äúvictims‚Äù in the case also deserves attention: in their opinion, a bunch of client and server programs is a single complex, and the illegal use of this ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù occurs even when you write a program replacing one of its parts.  As you understand, this approach is very promising for the ‚ÄúVortsov with piracy.‚Äù <br>  The result of all this was, of course, a conviction.  Upon appeal is upheld. <br>  (More links about this case are <a href="http://lqp.livejournal.com/230663.html%3Fstyle%3Dmine">here</a> ).

      Approximately the same thing is likely to happen with the ‚Äúruler‚Äù: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúAccording to detectives, the suspects created websites, registered them on the servers of hosting providers, and then placed pirated versions of the game on them.</i>  <i>In this case, the pirates, modifying the software code Lineage 2, somewhat changed the appearance of the game and gave it for its own product. "</i> <br><br>  That is, the version that these are different programs, the result, most likely, is not even considered.  Be sure they will prove ‚Äúillegal modification.‚Äù  With the help of Winamp and Microsoft Excel. <br>  In addition, "damage", "according to preliminary estimates by detectives, amounted to more than 100 million rubles."  This is very bad, this is the third, heavy, part of Article 146 of the Criminal Code.  It is possible to get it under arrest, especially if you move a closed server somewhere abroad, as the owners of one of the seized sites were going to do.  With the phrase "continued to engage in criminal activity."  This is nothing that the damage is ‚Äúinflated‚Äù, it is so in a number of ‚Äúpirated‚Äù cases: sometimes ‚Äúpre-release‚Äù works <a href="http://www.antirao.ru/faq/spravka-sposoby-proizvolnogo-uvelicheniya-razmera-prestupleniya-po-state-146-uk-0">are valued at millions of rubles for one disc</a> , and the investigation and the court obediently hawk it. <br>  In addition, judging by the entries in the blog of one of the "defendants", he somehow frivolously treats this whole thing.  The last entry there is dated by the beginning of March, I hope that this is simply because there is nothing to write, and not because the comrade is under arrest.  And the criminal record under article 146 (perhaps another 272/273) he has already secured for himself, unfortunately. <br>  In general, I have bad news for all owners of the "line".  If you keep the server in Russia - move.  I don‚Äôt know about servers working in ISPs, but it‚Äôs much easier to catch a ‚Äúpirate‚Äù than on the ‚Äúbig‚Äù Internet, most of the sentences for torrents, ‚Äúdonkey‚Äù, ds ++ and so on are made because of the distribution in lokalka . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88738/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88738/</a></p>
