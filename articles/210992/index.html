  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview of dedicated servers Kimsufi and SoYouStart</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> A year ago, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/167117/">an article</a> came out that prompted me to buy a server in <a href="http://www.kimsufi.com/">Kimsufi</a> - a division of a major French hoster, <a href="http://www.ovh.com/">OVH</a> , specializing in cheap servers, often on old hardware (there are processors from the '08 -09's).  The server turned out to be quite good, it was inexpensive, and in general I liked everything.  Around the same time, there were several articles about Proxmox on Habr√©, and it was I who put it there (since Proxmox was in the standard choice of hosting provider during installation), which I was very pleased with.  But today's article is not about that. <br><br>  After several months of using the ordered server, I recommended Kimsufi to my friend, and was surprised to find that, according to the updated agreement, only EU citizens can use the servers. <br><br>  And, from the new year, OVH launched a new site for sales of cheap dedicated servers - <a href="http://www.soyoustart.com/">SoYouStart.com</a> , and also opened up the opportunity for everyone to register on <a href="http://www.kimsufi.com/">Kimsufi.com</a> , and besides, the latter became available in <a href="http://www.kimsufi.com/ru/">Russian</a> !

      Under the cut - a review of new server offers from OVH - the new SoYouStart and the updated Kimsufi - <b>dedicated servers from 8 euros per month</b> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, two new offers from OVH - <a href="http://www.kimsufi.com/ru/">Kimsufi</a> and <a href="">SoYouStart</a> . <br><br>  <b>Kimsufi servers</b> are low-powered, but cheap servers.  A ruler from 8 euros per month for a PS-1 server with a single-core Celeron¬Æ 220 and two gigabytes of memory up to 30 euros for a PS-31 server on a 4-core Xeon E3-1225 v2 and 16 gigabytes of memory and 500 GB of disk per raid one.  Not bad! <br><br>  All Kimsufi servers have a 500 GB disk, moreover, starting from a PS-5 server for 12 euros, there are two disks in Raid-1 software.  It also provides a 100-megabit network, one ipv4 address and one ipv6 address (/ 128).  The one-time installation fee for Kimsufi servers is 10 Euro. <br><br>  <b>SoYouStart servers</b> continue the lineup and start from the server SYS-E32-1 with the same Xeon E3-1225v2 processor, but with 32 GB of memory and 2 TB of disk - for 35 euros.  The line ends with a SYS-W35-3 server with a Xeon-W3565 processor (an old Bloomfield) and 48 GB of memory for 48 euros.  More powerful servers are available on the main site OVH.com (from 82 euros). <br><br>  All SoYouStart servers have a 2 TB disk (soft-raid-1), and two servers have a 120 GB SSD disk (also in soft-raid-1, but two servers have hard-read).  Connected to a gigabit network with a guaranteed bandwidth of 200 Mbps, one ipv4 address and a / 64 ipv6 subnet are also given.  One-time installation fee for Kimsufi servers is 50 Euro. <br><br>  Kimsufi servers are only available in France, and SoYouStart servers are available at one of three French data centers, as well as at a data center in Canada.  Unfortunately, not all servers are available in any of the proposed data centers, and of the entire Kimsufi server line (31 positions in the line), only 13 are available for order (at least as of this writing). <br><br>  The following table lists the main server parameters for Kimsufi and SoYouStart.  For the bundle, one of the cheapest OVH main line servers and one of the cheapest Hetzner servers have been added to the table.  The table shows only available to order servers Kimsufi ( <a href="">full table</a> ). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/77b/c4e/32d/77bc4e32d3546cf3a76f63b5dd69e0aa.png"><br><br>  The column "Virt." Indicates whether the processor supports virtualization. <br><br>  The column ‚ÄúCPU bench benchmark‚Äù contains processor ratings for the site <a href="http://www.cpubenchmark.net/">www.cpubenchmark.net</a> . <br><br>  The ‚ÄúPower‚Äù columns show the conditional server power and take into account the processor and memory.  Calculated by the formula: <br><br>  Power rating CPU bench: <br> <code>() = ( CPU bench) / 1000 + ( )</code> <br> <br>  Power by frequency formula: <br> <code>() = (  ) x (- ) + ( )</code> <br> <blockquote>  A sharp increase in memory does not always give an equally sharp increase in performance (of course, apart from certain memory-demanding tasks), so I take into account the influence of the memory subsystem as the root of gigabytes of RAM. </blockquote><br>  The total power is the arithmetic average of the two previous columns.  This column takes into account both the computational potential, based on frequency, and the technology-dependent value, determined by the independent cpubenchmark rating. <br><br>  In the column ‚ÄúSpecific Rating‚Äù I derived the ‚Äúspecific cost‚Äù of the server - I divided the resulting total power by the cost of the server per month. <br><br>  All data is summarized <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc%3Fkey%3D0Atxnwb8-C24HdGw0WkNKd1Q5M0RMMWVVaWFvclM0S0E%26usp%3Dsharing">in a table</a> on Google Docs.  Unfortunately, Google Spreadsheet does not know how to color the columns as conveniently as MS Excel. <br><br>  It is clear that the proposed formula for calculating the power is far from ideal, but it shows an approximate ratio.  If someone offers a more competent estimate of server capacity, I will add the proposed method to the table. <br><br><h5>  Results </h5><br><br>  In my opinion, Kimsufi servers are quite an interesting offer.  If someone needs a dedicated server and the VPS is not satisfied, but there is not enough money for the popular Hetzner, or a powerful server is simply not required, then this offer is for you.  In the end, many domestic hosters offer less powerful VPS for much more money. <br><br>  SoYouStart servers turned out to be priced at the cheapest Hetzner server, but they have mostly older hardware, which led to a lower specific rating. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/210992/">https://habr.com/ru/post/210992/</a></p>
