However, taking into account the fact that a significant part of the vehicles sent to Venus and Mars were lost, and the average time of their work did not exceed a couple of years (compared to decades with many vehicles exploring the Sun), the situation in the research apparatus-years is still in favor of The sun <a name="habracut"></a>

Despite the fact that the main goal (getting into the moon) failed, her mission was very successful.  One of the achievements of this device is the first in the history of direct observation of the characteristics of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0-1">solar wind</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/848/054/0a3/8480540a38664b99bfc29c5fae33693c.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580-5"><b>Pioneer-5</b></a> - made the first measurements of the interplanetary magnetic field, the level of radiation and the properties of solar flares.  Despite the rapid failure (he worked in orbit from March 11 to April 30, 1960), this tiny satellite weighing 45 kg with a diameter of 66 cm is considered the most successful of the entire series of Pioneer satellites. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7b6/e07/c27/7b6e07c27b934e09b97bf2970afffdbc.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbiting_Solar_Observatory">Orbiting Solar Observatory</a> ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbiting_Solar_Observatory">Orbiting Solar Observatory</a> ) satellites are 8 consecutively launched vehicles aimed at studying the 11-year solar cycles in ultraviolet and x-rays.  From the launch of the first observatory on March 7, 1962 and until the end of the last of them in October 1978, usually two or three vehicles of this series were in orbit.  The orientation of the apparatus on the sun was carried out by rotation. <br><br>  A serious accident is connected with the second device: on April 14, 1964, on tests of integration of the device with the third solid-propellant <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0-C">Delta-C</a> rocket, one of the technicians accidentally set fire to it with a discharge of static electricity, while three people burned in the incident, and the device ricocheted from the roof in the corner of the building .  It took 10 months to restore it, after which it was launched on February 3, 1965. <br><br>  The third unit did have to be made in duplicate, since the modifications in the third stage Delta-C (made after the previous case) led to its premature launch in flight, and the unit itself burned down in dense layers of the atmosphere.  Despite this, the new ‚Äúthird‚Äù device was able to establish the uniformity of gamma radiation throughout the sky, and also found x-ray flashes from the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD_X-1">Scorpius X-1</a> object.

They can be attributed to the first "long-term" scientific missions - the last connection with the Pioneer-6 device was established on December 8, 2000 (in honor of its 35th anniversary). <br><br>  Presumably, with the exception of Pioneer 9, which failed in 1983, they are still functional.  The main reason for not using them further is the archaic nature of the instruments (the capabilities of which overlapped the new satellites) and communication facilities (requiring huge plates at a communication speed of 512 bit / s). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f01/2ec/293/f012ec29393c453798d03114a6e5365d.png"><br><br>  A pair of devices of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helios_(spacecraft)"><b>Helios</b></a> series (launched on December 10, 1974 and January 15, 1976) is a joint development of NASA and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%2580_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8">DFVLR</a> (then also in the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D1%2583%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D0%2593%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8_(1949%25E2%2580%25941990)">Federal Republic of Germany</a> ).

The devices were able to detect "magnetic clouds" from the plasma (together with another satellite, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Maximum_Mission">SMM</a> ), but at the time they could not link their origin with coronal mass ejections. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e3/dc/59e3dc6c842bd340362486.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  <b><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B4%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582">The international comet explorer</a></b> - launched on August 12, 1978, became the first spacecraft launched into <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D1%2580%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0_%25D0%259B%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B6%25D1%2583">orbit by Lissajous</a> , at which it rotates around the L <sub>1</sub> point between the Earth and the Sun.  The device has three detectors of cosmic rays of various energies, detectors of protons and magnetic fields, waves in a plasma, and x-rays.  Having completed his main mission on the study of solar-terrestrial connections, solar wind and cosmic rays on June 10, 1982, he was sent to study <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/21P/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8_%25E2%2580%2594_%25D0%25A6%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0">comet Jacobini-Zinner</a> , whose tail he passed on September 11, 1985. <br><br>  On May 5, 1997, the device was sent by NASA to "retire" with the shutdown of all scientific instruments.  In 1999 and 2008, NASA verified its condition.  In April 2014, a project to restore communication with this device, which collected almost $ 160 thousand, appeared on the RocketHub crowdfunding platform.  Already on May 29, 2014, this team managed to establish a connection with the device (with the permission of NASA, of course).  And on July 2, they tried to start its engines for the first time since 1987, but this was not possible due to the lack of nitrogen to pressurize the tanks.  The team continued to work with scientific instruments until September 16, when contact with the device was lost.  Presumably this was due to the reduction in the release of energy by solar panels, as the device flew past the Earth flying away from the Sun at that moment (so communication with the device was already lost in 1981).  The next meeting of the apparatus with the Earth should occur in 2031. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ad3/f08/5c2/ad3f085c2e9445e583b4602b35ebe209.jpg"></a> <br><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25BE%25D1%258F%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580"><b>Voyager 1 and 2</b></a> - although the main purpose of these vehicles was to study the outer planets of the solar system, they also contributed to the study of the sun: they were used to refine the properties of the solar wind at different distances from the sun, the speed of propagation of coronal emissions of matter and location <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2583%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0">the head shock wave of the</a> solar system (places where the solar wind collides with the interstellar medium). <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/daf/4ce/06a/daf4ce06a4674c94afe18062a714bbde.jpg"></a> <br><br>  <b>Solar Maximum Mission</b> (also known as <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Maximum_Mission">SolarMax</a> or simply SMM) was launched on February 14, 1980 to study solar phenomena.

In the course of this, the device was found near the expected position, but the data showed that it rotates at a speed of 1 turn in 53 seconds with the solar panels lost their orientation on the Sun. <br><br>  Only by August 3, when the orientation of the solar batteries was partially restored and the batteries of the device began to charge, a short signal was received from him in a few seconds long.  After charging both batteries on August 12, SOHO was given the command to turn on the heaters of the tanks with hydrazine, which by that time was completely frozen.  Several times the warm-up process had to be suspended as the telemetry showed that the batteries started to discharge (the orientation of the solar cells was not accurate and they did not cover the heaters' energy needs, and the <a href="https://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/operations/Recovery/recovery_team.html">‚Äúrescue team‚Äù SOHO</a> did not want to risk reducing the battery charge).  After the process of heating the fuel tanks and fuel pipelines, SOHO was again oriented to the Sun on September 16.  Then the gradual recovery of the instruments started: SUMER - was launched the first on October 7, COSTEP and ERNE were switched on on the 9th, UVCS - on the 10th, MDI - on the 12th, LASCO and EIT - the 13th, CDS and SWAN - 17- first, and only on October 23, with the launch of the last device (CELIAS), the device fully restored its functionality. <br><br>  However, this was not the end of his adventures: after the restoration of the working capacity of scientific instruments, it turned out that only 1 of the 3 gyroscopes of the device continues to work, and on December 21 the remaining gyroscope was also out of order.  The ESA had to develop a new work program for SOHO so that it could continue to work without spending the remaining precious fuel.  The apparatus was reprogrammed on February 1, 1999. <br><br>  Despite this start, a terrible start, the device continues to work without significant failures.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But any equipment eventually becomes obsolete, and with the SDO placed into orbit at the beginning of 2010, some SOHO devices having common tasks began to be turned off: in July 2010, the EIT device was transferred to a limited mode and takes only two sets of images per day (for the sake of maintaining a continuous series of observations), since April 12, 2011, the MDI device has been turned off, on 23rd of January 2013 - UVCS, on August 8, 2014 - SUMER, and on September 5th - CDS. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition to its main mission, SOHO, with the help of volunteers, helped to open 2,000 comets by </font></font><a href="https://soho.nascom.nasa.gov/hotshots/2010_12_28/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">December 26,</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 2010, and by </font></font><a href="https://soho.nascom.nasa.gov/hotshots/2015_09_15/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">September 13,</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 2015, their number exceeded 3,000 - thus, using the SDO, more than half of all the known comets were discovered . </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/0f3/6cb/7bf/0f36cb7bfbf747c491020fc2bb511b3a.jpg"><br><br> <b><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Composition_Explorer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Advanced Composition Explorer</font></font></a></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- This device was launched on August 25, 1997 to study high-energy particles of the solar wind and interplanetary medium.

To accomplish their mission, they were sent into orbits around the Sun in such a way that one unit would overtake the Earth a little, and the other would lag behind it a little. Thus, they received a picture of two points equally spaced from the Earth, which gradually moved away.
