  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Customer focus as the basis of business: Experience IaaS-provider "1cloud"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  All new players are appearing on the cloud services market today, but not everyone knows where to start a business and in what areas to develop it.  So it was with the company <a href="https://1cloud.ru/">1cloud</a> : its founders Vitaly Gritsay and Konstantin Kudryashov conceived their project as a ‚Äúcloud solutions store‚Äù - a service where software manufacturers and integrators would register their templates, and customers would deploy them at the capacities of 1cloud. <br><br>  But the analysis and the first tests showed that the direction of the project needs to be changed.  From the marketplace, 1cloud has turned into an IaaS and PaaS provider with full automation of all customer requests.  The main task of the service is to make complex things (from the point of view of IT infrastructure management) simple for users and to lower the threshold for entry into this area among non-specialists. <br><br>  Today we would like to talk about what decisions were made in the company 1cloud on the way to the development of the service and what services were introduced to ensure the convenience of users.

Our service has quite different clients: individuals and legal entities, web studios and application developers, site owners and integrator companies.  At first glance, it is impossible to meet the requirements of each category of users.  But it is not. <br><br>  As a result of the research, we found that for any client in the first place is the simplicity and ease of use of the service.  It is important for all users to quickly deploy a site without being immersed in technical problems.  And this means that in order to ensure a high level of convenience and speed, you need to save users from having to install, configure extra software, as well as monitor its operation and the relevance of licenses. <br><br>  To do this, we have implemented the server order function for organizing our own hosting with a preinstalled control panel.  In this case, the server is configured in a special constructor, which in real time shows the change in its cost depending on the choice of parameters. <br><br>  Another problem faced by all hosting users is the administration of leased licenses for the programs used.  To make it easier to track information about which licenses are activated for a particular server, as well as their cost data, there is a special page in the 1cloud system where users can add licenses or extend existing ones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/331/8c9/d66/3318c9d662f04738951fd3e212202945.png"><br>  <i>Additional licenses on the <a href="https://1cloud.ru/infrastructure/panel-upravleniya">1cloud service page</a></i> <br><br>  The next task we paid attention to was the issue of improving the quality of integration of client applications with our cloud.  In order for customers to have the ability to manage their servers from third-party applications, we implemented the REST <a href="https://1cloud.ru/api">API</a> .  So we made the service more convenient for a whole group of users, among which are resellers of our services, partner companies, and application developers (API helps to automatically scale the hosting infrastructure). <br><br>  Another of the functions provided to users is the ability to select different types of <a href="https://1cloud.ru/news/Dostupna_vozmojnost_dobavleniya_diskov_raznih_tipov">disks</a> for different tasks.  This approach is justified when creating multi-tier data storage systems.  Data that is often used by applications can be placed on faster drives, such as SSDs, and to store online backups, you can connect a slower, but cheaper and larger SATA drive to the server. <br><br>  Using different types of disks allows you to make the overall infrastructure solution more flexible, efficient and cost-optimized and meets the needs of many categories of users.  In addition, all clients have the ability to manage disk space on the fly - so they can order additional disks for their virtual servers without stopping them. <br><br><h3>  Know customers in person </h3><br>  Of course, we take into account the individual needs of customers and offer them optimal solutions, which sometimes go beyond the direct services of an IaaS provider.  For example, for legal entities, the possibility of quickly generating bills, acts of work performed, and reconciliation acts turned out to be equally important.  Therefore, companies can now see full information about the status of the account. <br><br>  We decided to go even further and made life easier for business by making it possible to place ‚Äú1C <a href="https://1cloud.ru/news/Avtomatizacija_buhgalterskih_zadach">Accounting</a> ‚Äù in the cloud, which makes it easy to organize distributed access to it.  Now, accountants do not need to be in the office to make any changes.  Such solutions can significantly increase customer loyalty and make the service even more convenient. <br><br>  Further, we decided to continue to study the needs of this category of users in order to understand what other services may be in demand.  We realized that many corporate clients are interested in creating <a href="https://1cloud.ru/news/Chastnye_seti_i_shablony_virtualnyh_serverov">private networks</a> .  The relevance of this function was due, for example, to security issues, so as not to broadcast all traffic through the public Internet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/255/3c1/14d/2553c114df5643818ae159c2bcfa093d.png"><br>  <i>Creating a private network through the 1cloud control panel</i> <br><br>  In addition, customers wanted to increase the speed (the speed of public connections varies from 10 to 100 Mbit / s, and the width of the private network channel we have is 10 Gbit / s) and improve the efficiency of applications.  This has led to the emergence of the possibility of incorporating client servers into the private network using the 1cloud control panel interface. <br><br>  We analyzed the other categories of clients and identified the functions necessary for them.  For integrator companies, we provided the opportunity to customize our solutions and create templates from reconfigured services, and we offered web studios affiliate programs that allowed them to get a steady income. <br><br>  It is important for application developers to quickly deploy test benches and production benches (as part of continuous integration processes), and reliability becomes a plus for site owners as load increases and the ability to flexibly change the configuration of virtual servers, adapting it to current needs. <br><br>  As for individuals, they most often use a virtual infrastructure for tasks that require large computing power, which are unlikely to exist on a home PC.  These are just a few examples of using virtual infrastructure for the needs of businesses and individuals - the number of such examples is growing both in the industry and in our practice - not least thanks to the work on the user interface. <br><br><h3>  Interface - the face of the company </h3><br>  All the above transformations were implemented in the process of working and studying users.  Of course, at the first stage one should not try to ‚Äúmake a product for everyone at once,‚Äù since for a young project this almost always leads to a slowdown in the development process and its excessive complication.  In our case, at the very beginning of the journey, we focused on identifying the main consumers.  They turned out to be legal entities, so the main work was carried out precisely in this direction. <br><br>  The next difficulty on the way to creating a service at the initial stage was the choice of a suitable design.  At first glance, the design is just a ‚Äúwrapper‚Äù, something derivative in relation to the product itself.  But we in 1cloud quickly came to understand that the interface and design is, in fact, the first, and often the only thing that the user faces.  Ignore this aspect, considering it secondary, in no way. <br><br>  At the stage of testing the business model, we decided to push off from the design page of the western IT company DigitalOcean.  This allowed us, on the one hand, to quickly test the hypothesis and understand that our service would be useful to potential customers, on the other hand, to study the criticism of users who did not like the visual similarity of products.  As a result, we came to understand the need to emphasize the individuality of the service with a unique, but at the same time user-friendly design. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/52a/776/08b/52a77608b8364475ad7600e165617c14.png"><br>  <i>First interface: hypothesis testing ...</i> <br><br>  Therefore, we redesigned the appearance of the site.  The new version is optimized in terms of searching for information that users pay attention to when they get acquainted with the 1cloud service.  In addition, in the future we plan to launch a mobile application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f9/509/11d/6f950911dd474b12bc05cd2dd6932830.png"><br>  <i>... current version: running product - <a href="https://1cloud.ru/services/vps-vds">VPS / VDS</a> order window</i> <br><br><h3>  findings </h3><br>  Based on our own experience with the development of the IaaS provider 1cloud, we can conclude that we should not be afraid to change the direction of activity if the initial hypothesis was not confirmed.  It is important to constantly improve your product, make it convenient for all categories of users: even if your audience of clients is mainly other companies, this does not mean that there will always be specialists in their staff who have the time and knowledge to deal with the work of your product. <br><br>  Most likely, even people who are able to do everything ‚Äúdo it yourself‚Äù will thank you for automating certain services and providing easier to use solutions.  After all, this is why companies or people turn to you.  What you do for them is not their main job.  therefore, they will be grateful if you make it easier. <br><br>  <strong>PS</strong> A few materials about the development of our IaaS-provider: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://1cloud.ru/news/myths-about-cloud-providers-part1">Cloud Technology Myths.</a>  <a href="https://1cloud.ru/news/myths-about-cloud-providers-part1">Part 1</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://1cloud.ru/news/it-project-area-choice">How to choose a direction for the development of an IT project</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://1cloud.ru/news/how-to-create-iaas-provider">How to create a virtual infrastructure provider</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/312120/">https://habr.com/ru/post/312120/</a></p>
