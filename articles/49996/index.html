In addition to the driver works navigator.  Innovative minibus has an approximate route: for example, clockwise around the city center.

      The site, which should support different mobile devices, displays the location of the bus and the route for the near future.  Those who wish to ride leave the application on the site in the form of a point from which to pick up, and a point where you need to get there.  The navigator compiles the route based on the applications and you can estimate how quickly the IT-bus will reach you. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Where and when is it useful? </h4><br>  In the daytime, in places with well-working vehicles such a gadget is useless. <br><br>  At night, an innovative minibus will be very useful.  You sit in a bar, relax, feel - it's time to go home.  You take out the smartphone, you are noted, in a couple of minutes you know, when approximately the IT-bus will pick you up. <br><br>  IT-bus can be useful in areas with a large area: in industrial zones or in the suburbs.  Here, however, it is important that the users of the mobile Internet were enough.  However, the mobile Internet is developing so fast that in 5 years every grandmother will have this thing. <br><br><h4>  Aesthetics of innovative minibus </h4><br>  Innovative minibus should be different.  Should play easy house or lounge (note on the perspective).  It is better to paint a minibus under a hippie-mobile, so that <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA">strangers</a> would not accidentally climb. <br><br><h4>  Software navigator </h4><br>  The main difficulty - a clear work navigator.  We can not "forget" customers, it is necessary to make the best route, taking into account all landings and landings. <br><br>  I do not believe in artificial intelligence, but programs that would help the navigator are necessary.  I see the following: <br>  - a program offering routes to the nearest points, the final decision remains for the navigator; <br>  - a program that keeps records of all passengers not taken, and all not landed; <br>  - a program that would calculate the approximate time for each passenger before landing and before the exit. <br><br>  It is important to develop an easy-to-understand routing interface - there can be many points, it is easy to get confused.  Usability rules, reread Steve Krug and Jacob Nielsen. <br><br><h4>  Payment and trolls </h4><br>  Everything that is regulated via the Internet, sooner or later falls under the attack of the trolls.  Suppose a certain group of destructive-minded individuals is registered on the site, puts an unimaginable number of points on the map, the bus travels along a difficult route, but there are no people.  Excess gas consumption, hassle for the navigator and driver, the delay time for users.  With a serious attack, work can be completely paralyzed. <br><br>  Only one way out - payment must be made at the time of the point on the card.  Either the payment goes through a web wallet, or through a withdrawal from a personal account in the system, and the account must be replenished in advance.  This, of course, is a serious obstacle while electronic money is not so popular.  But we are talking about the future, although not so remote. <br><br>  The conclusion of contracts with payment terminals would be a good help.  Pay and order immediately.  IT-bus is on its way to you. <br><br>  Possible payment option via CMC, or through debiting funds from the user's phone (thanks to <a href="http://lesnig.habrahabr.ru/">Lesnig</a> for the help). <br><br><h4>  Big cities </h4><br>  The city in which I live (Tver), a small one, at night time you can make a big circle in about thirty minutes.  However, in Moscow, one innovative minibus in the city can wind for two or three hours. <br><br>  The solution is possible the following: creating several approximate routes, for example: <br>  - center-north <br>  - center-east <br>  - center-south <br>  - center-west. <br><br>  If the order and payment system is uniform, then you can provide discounts for 2 minibuses in a row.  And even make the payment as in the subway - one payment, for the transfer of money is not taken.  You specify the starting and ending points, and where to transplant you is the navigators' business. <br><br><h4>  Social self-organization </h4><br>  <a href="http://wilwill.habrahabr.ru/">Wilwill</a> proposed the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a service that would unite potential passengers and drivers - drivers would mark their intended route, and passengers would mark their intended route.  The system would select options. <br><br>  If you make a good API, then the system could be integrated into social networks and still make money on it.  The system is quite viable, although there is a danger that ordinary taxi drivers will get into it and spoil everything.  We have to agree on some low fixed fee. <br><br>  By the way, Beijing is remembered this summer.  There, to improve the ecology, private traders traveled every other day: cars with even numbers drove through even numbers, and with odd numbers even through odd ones.  Immediately there was a service for the selection of people who have similar routes to work from work.  Registration fee, and bring each other should have been free. <br><br><h4>  Prospects for innovative minibus </h4><br>  For some reason I think that the innovation bus has a future.  Probably because I came up with it! <br><br>  We have about 40 routes in Tver, but it is still not always convenient to get there, even during the day.  The suburbs are often difficult to leave.  At night there is no choice - just a taxi. <br><br>  Innovative minibus could be an alternative to taxis, winning in price, and an alternative to public transport, winning in flexibility.  And as for the IT-atmosphere, it is easy to make those and others! <br><br><h4>  Idea license </h4><br>  The idea is distributed free of charge, that is, free of charge, but with the condition that on every innovative minibus there should be a large link to <a href="http://vadimgalkin.pp.ru/" title="Personal page of Vadim Galkin">my personal page</a> .  Same thing when publishing an article. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/49996/">https://habr.com/ru/post/49996/</a></p>
