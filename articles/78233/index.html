  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Laptop for the best design</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hey.  On the eve of the New Year, we, together with the Gozo.ru website and our regular partner, the network of <a href="http://notik.ru/">Notik</a> stores, decided to organize a kind of creative competition with a good main prize: the <a href="http://www.notik.ru/goods/7156.htm">Dell Latitude D430</a> + <a href="http://www.notik.ru/goods/7156.htm">laptop,</a> something else.  The essence of the event is simple. <br><br>  We, as you know, have recently organized the sale of our branded habrafutball (in Smart-Masses, by the way, <a href="http://www.smart-masses.ru/catalog/apparel/tshirts/427/">there are</a> still old stocks at a reduced price), but here‚Äôs the problem: there were different designs for a cat.  At the same time, topics with amateur designs, some of which were worthy of implementation, appeared on Habr√© more than once.  So, it is obvious that among you there are a lot of those who come up and make much more cool and interesting layouts than we once did.  And therefore we ask you to participate in creating the best habrafutbolok in the world.  To the author of the coolest layout, we and the ‚ÄúNotik‚Äù will wholeheartedly give a decent laptop and a T-shirt with our own pattern, and the other four a little less successful - for any nominal t-shirt to choose from.  And also: for each t-shirt sold her author will receive royalties. <br><br>  So, what to do: <a name="habracut"></a><br>  - to take billets of <a href="">T-shirts</a> and <a href="">habralogotypes</a> , armed with appropriate tools, to make a <i>one</i> - <i>sided</i> layout of a shirt that you want to wear yourself; <br>  - send the resulting mockup with an email with the subject ‚ÄúHabra-T-shirt‚Äù to us at editor@habrahabr.ru (we look at the mock-ups in the comments, but do not accept participation, use mail); <br>  - wait for the T-shirts with their layout and ... <br>  - ... to do everything so that this T-shirt is sold more than others :)

      The winner will be the one whose T-shirt will be sold (that is, ordered and paid for in the Gozo.ru store) in the greatest quantity by the end of the <s>last Sunday of this year, that is, on December 27,</s> March 31, 2010.  From 00:00 on February 1, work will be terminated. <br><br>  Now some important nuances: <br>  - the picture should be somehow connected with Habr (the inscription ‚ÄúI saw Mizgol on Habr√©‚Äù, for example, rolls, and ‚ÄúI saw Mizgol‚Äù - not) and contain the address of the site, but the presence of the logo (or its elements) is optional.  The logo, by the way, can be used in any form: only ‚Äúhair‚Äù without an inscription, only an inscription, or all together.  If the layout includes a logo whose size is larger than that provided, feel free to increase the logo: during production it will be replaced with a quality one. <br>  - the image on the model should not violate the laws of the Russian Federation and anyone's copyrights (you can‚Äôt do anything); <br>  - technical requirements for layouts: formats - vector or raster;  if you do in a vector, it is advisable not to allow the appearance of small details (very small letters, thin lines, very small holes, etc., a small habweb, for example, will not roll);  if you work with a raster, then make a drawing in natural size with a resolution of at least 300 dpi.  And yet: it is not practical to make layouts for t-shirts with dimensions greater than 250 mm in width and 350 mm in height; <br>  - each author can send as many different layouts as they want, as long as they are interesting and of high quality; <br>  - only those models that will meet the technical requirements and our inner feelings of the beautiful are allowed to participate in the competition (that is, they will go on sale): mats, stupidity, porn and Dzhigurda will not pass. <br>  - it is possible to stimulate the sales of your habra-T-shirts by any available means, even buying up a large lot with your own money :) <br><br>  In the course of the competition, follow the updates of this topic: we will publish links to all the layouts and names of the authors that went on sale. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Good Samaritan laid out the archive with the drawn habral - <a href="http://depositfiles.com/files/f0p4bpwfl">http://depositfiles.com/files/f0p4bpwfl</a> .  However, keep in mind that, firstly, these logos are unofficial, and secondly, their illegal use entails ... blah blah blah, well, you know. <br><br>  <b>UPD2:</b> in connection with the appearance in our box of mock-ups on other people's T-shirt images, and even in the png, gif and jpg formats, I hasten to inform you that Tru designers do not do that. <br><br>  <b>UPD3:</b> since the process of bringing the submitted models to the mind took longer than planned, the deadlines for the competition are shifted by a month. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78233/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78233/</a></p>
