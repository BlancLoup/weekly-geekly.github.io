    <h4>  Summary </h4><br>  SMM blooms on the fertile soil of high-quality and original content.  What separates the banal and boring posts from those that fly like lightning in the social.  networks?  Hotel-casino "Aria" chose this style of communication in the social.  networks, as the "story stories" and received a sharp increase in repost by 310%. <br>  Let's find out what the results of the previous, not so successful advertising campaign led to. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Problem </h4><br>  In Las Vegas, everyone is trying to get your attention.  Against this background, it is difficult to somehow stand out, especially for a new casino. <br>  Aria was opened in 2009 and Derek Schoen, director of interactive marketing, launched the first marketing campaign, “Vegas Center.  Has shifted.  In this advertising campaign, emphasis was placed on the novelty of the casino, which, according to calculations, was in itself to attract customers. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9cb/66f/57f/9cb66f57f9f010b94dcd73d9d1edaca0.png"><br>  “However, we noticed that advertising in the first place caused potential customers to wonder why they should visit this particular hotel?” Said Schoen.  Most marketers, at this moment, would begin to bite their elbows out of desperation.  But the team "Arias", on the contrary, saw this as an opportunity. <br><br><h4>  Campaign </h4><br>  The Arias team applied the technique that Shoen calls the “storytelling”.  Instead of directly urging people to visit the hotel-casino, the team showed why they could become hotel customers. <br>  Also hoping that the reasons will be interesting enough so that people can share it in the social.  networks. <br><br><h4>  Step # 1. Find something unique </h4><br>  Marketing specialists made a list of more than a dozen of the advantages and features of Aria, which would help emphasize its uniqueness.  The list includes: <br><br>  <b>"Bar Masa"</b> - the restaurant of Japanese cuisine of the highest class <br><br>  <b>The Golden Living Room</b> is a living room dedicated to Elvis Presley (the theme has changed since then). <br><br>  <b>Blossom</b> is a Chinese restaurant with a relaxed atmosphere and private gazebos. <br><br><h4>  Step # 2. Tell what's unique </h4><br>  The team moved to a deeper level, describing in detail the uniqueness of all the selected hotel features. <br>  For example, marketers identified the following four details that made Bar Mass outstanding: <br><br>  • <b>Chef</b> - Chef Masa Takayama owns a restaurant that has received three Michelin stars.  And this is the first Japanese restaurant in the United States awarded this honor.  “If you want to go to his restaurant in New York, you will have to book a table 2 months in advance,” said Schoen. <br><br>  • <b>Super freshness</b> - “Our fish was caught no more than 24 hours ago, before being on your plate” <br><br>  • <b>Cocktails</b> - You can try high-quality Japanese liqueurs, whiskey and sake.  “They are offered with a limited selection of cocktails to better emphasize their authenticity,” said Sean. <br><br>  • <b>Service</b> - The restaurant adheres to the traditional Japanese style of customer service, which can be called a true work of art. <br><br>  <b>More than unique</b> <br>  These benefits of the Bara Masa were not just unique.  They helped Aria to stand out visibly from the competition.  “These cool little stories showed that we were the best in these areas,” said Schoen. <br><br><h4>  Step # 3. Create visual images (photos and videos) </h4><br>  The team saw that all these details, or “short stories,” were of great interest to Facebook and Twitter users.  The team wanted to <i>show</i> more than just <i>talk</i> .  To do this, using a conventional digital camera, they began to do, as Shoen said, “cool, funny, and fast photos”.  These photos beautifully illustrated the little stories.  They included such photos as: <br><br>  • Several types of fresh sushi <br><br>  • Gaming machines with monitors that resemble curved 40-inch TVs (the only ones in Vegas) <br><br>  • Private gazebos in the Chinese restaurant Blossom <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6df/361/e5f/6df361e5fdf1ae784e316d22c2c34a02.png"><br><br>  <b>The team even made several video clips:</b> <br><br>  " <b>Lumina"</b> - "The only colorful fountain in the world that can be seen even in sunlight" <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3f0/db1/a6a/3f0db1a6a723bf126e4107c385dc6f18.jpg"><br><br>  <b>The crystals in the City Center</b> are a high-tech water show that “shouldn’t be missed while visiting Las Vegas.” <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/yNxxRzDN0K0&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgJOCseiQ2XFjIbRfFdiijUwmRrYQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Step # 4. Spread the stories </h4><br>  The Arias team began sharing these mini-stories with their Facebook audience (678,000 subscribers at the time of this article) and Twitter (134,000 subscribers).  If the first advertising campaign stated that, “Center Vegas.  Has shifted ”, now in every little story, this slogan has been slightly modified, for example: <br><br>  <b>"Bar Mass"</b> - "#Culinary Center, shifted" <br><br>  <b>"Blossom"</b> - "#Center of Privacy, has shifted" <br><br>  <b>"City Center Crystals"</b> - "#Charm Center, has shifted" <br><br>  The team included these headers in all new posts, using the original hashtag, "#Center". <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6a2/e24/25f/6a2e2425fb108a98c2cfc75f112950e7.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Step number 5. Do not push for booking </h4><br>  “In Las Vegas, it’s very difficult to get people to book in advance.  Usually, people choose what they want to do and then spend their time spontaneously in Las Vegas, ”said Schoen. <br><br>  That is why marketers of Aria did not set a goal to immediately motivate users to use online reservations with the help of stories.  Instead, the team sought to raise awareness of the hotel and all its benefits, creating a positive impression. <br><br>  “We would like you to have pleasant emotions, and you would learn a lot of interesting and new things,” said Schoen. <br>  “We are doing this so that the next time people are in Las Vegas, they could say:“ Hey, I heard about Bar Mas, I want to try what sushi they have there. ” <br><br><h4>  results </h4><br>  The team of "Arias" sought to ensure that mini stories (with photos and videos) not only attracted attention, but also actively spread by social users.  networks.  “The number of reposts of this content has increased 4 times, compared to our average level.  The most widely distributed content of all that we did was stories created as part of the Center’s latest advertising campaign, said Schoen.  Posts with small stories several times exceeded the average Aria figures: <br><br>  <b>310%</b> increase in the number of reposts with the hashtag "# TheCenter" <br><br>  <b>200%</b> increase in interaction speed <br><br>  <b>320%</b> increase in the audience who liked it (the number of "likes" and subscribers) <br><br>  “I like to talk about stories,” said Schoen, “because this is something that every company should do, but does not always do.  And I think that in the marketing of history is the main thing. " </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/217025/">https://habr.com/ru/post/217025/</a></p>
