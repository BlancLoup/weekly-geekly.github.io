      Trigger-based email marketing is just the tool to help you increase conversion.  If for the first stages of the funnel trigger-email is not an assistant (and this is its only drawback), then it is ideal for the final stages (lead heating, sale, resale).  It perfectly combines automation and personalization, the relevance of which we have already written in the <a href="http://carrotquest.ru/blog/5-prichin-otdat-oskar-e-mail-marketingu/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_term%3Dsoldatov%26utm_content%3Dtrigger%26utm_campaign%3Demail-marketing">article</a> . <br><br>  Trigger messages are automatically sent when a user performs an action (event). <br><br>  <b>For example:</b> <br><ul><li>  if the user is registered - he is sent a letter of thanks for registration; </li><li>  if the user put the product in the basket, but did not buy it within 10 minutes - a reminder about the left product is sent; </li><li>  if the user has not visited the site (in his personal account) for the past 30 days, a reminder letter is sent. </li></ul><br>  <b>Conditions (triggers) can be different:</b> <br><ul><li>  by time (for example, the user has not visited the site in the last 7 days); </li><li>  by action (for example, a user has viewed the same product 2 or more times); </li><li>  taking into account the properties of the user (for example, we can identify users who came from contextual advertising). </li></ul><br>  Occurring events tell us a lot.  As in the example above, the user has viewed the product on the site 2 or more times.  He is probably considering a purchase.  And we must push him to this purchase, until he went to the competitors.  If you automate the process - this is trigger email marketing. <br><br>  The objectives of the letters may differ, depending on the stage of involvement of the user, the scope of activities, etc.  What we will analyze in detail below. <br><br><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/45e/322/dc2/45e322dc2bb3a0a7f30b48650ab868ef.jpg" alt="image09" width="1509" height="270"></a> <br><br><br><br>  The only problem is that in order to use this tool you must know the user's email address (therefore, trigger-email is powerless in the early stages of the funnel).  In our service <a href="http://carrotquest.ru/marketing%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_term%3Dsoldatov%26utm_content%3Dtrigger%26utm_campaign%3Demail-marketing">Carrot Quest,</a> you can collect addresses from any field on the site.  The address is automatically linked to the user's personal card.  This card also stores data about all the actions of the visitor, his correspondence history.  With this information any trigger mailing on the shoulder. <br><br>  In the next article we will discuss the question of how to send a message to the user if he did not leave an email.  Do not miss!  And now, on triggers about trigger email marketing ... <br><br><h3>  <b>Engagement cycle</b> </h3><br>  In order to work on increasing conversion from one stage to another, you need to have a good understanding of the sales funnel (engagement cycle) in your company.  We'll take as an example the standard user engagement cycle.  The basis of all about this.  Stages can be broken down into sub-steps.  Accordingly, in different business areas or with different approaches, the funnel will be different (for example, it will be wider and deeper). <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/712/50a/5e1/71250a5e10eb2e251969eb48698a0b87.png" alt="image00" width="976" height="100"></a> <br><br>  Trigger-based email marketing works during the sale and return stages, which we will analyze.  Let's imagine that the Lead in our understanding is a user who has already left us his email.  From this point, and begin to build their trigger email-campaign. <br><br><h3>  <b>1. Increase sales with trigger email marketing</b> </h3><br>  If you know your customers and how they behave, then trigger email marketing will increase the number of purchases and the average bill. <br><br>  Before the sale does not reach a large percentage of your users.  You have to understand exactly at what stage they ‚Äúfall off‚Äù and start holding them back. <br><br><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/4d3/fb0/a52/4d3fb0a52f6004e213fb9d46c7cdaf7d.jpg" alt="image08" width="1268" height="667"></a> <br><br>  We divide the sale stage into 2 cases: <br><ul><li>  We sell to those who have not completed the order (dropped the basket); </li><li>  We increase the conversion to the purchase of products of interest to the user. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  <b>A. We sell to those who have not completed the order</b> (dropped the basket) </h4><br>  Each of you was surprised at least once, seeing how many users began to place an order (payment), but did not finish.  For online stores it is generally a common thing, as for us to brush your teeth in the morning.  You can see for yourself.  There is a lot of information in the network, which shows that the percentage of "abandoned" baskets in stores is on average 50-70%. <br><br>  Imagine if you start working with these numbers.  If you return at least 15% of those who have left, then you will already significantly improve your sales. <br><br>  Recently I came across an interesting foreign example.  How <a href="https://peakdesign.com/">Peak Design</a> (a store selling photo and video equipment) returns users to ‚Äúdrop out‚Äù baskets.  They send 2 letters.  The first is sent 30 minutes after the user leaves the basket, the second after 30 hours. <br><br>  This is what the first letter looks like (after 30 minutes): <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/523/e0d/398/523e0d398d5781527421db64519f5e8e.png" alt="image10" width="520" height="850"></a> <br><br>  If the reader did not respond to the 1st letter, in 30 hours he will receive the 2nd, in which a small discount is offered. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/331/ac3/a6b/331ac3a6b5fca760998280d2b05aad69.png" alt="image11" width="520" height="850"></a> <br><br>  Peak Designe thus returns 12% of left users. <br><br>  You can take this figure as an average value and multiply it by the average revenue (profit) from the basket.  You can receive such amounts additionally if you just set up a similar campaign of trigger-mailings. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/9c8/5cc/b9b/9c85ccb9bfd11843c32d87f3318bfc67.jpg" alt="image12" width="801" height="272"></a> <br><br>  To combat the abandoned basket in the Carrot Quest, there are other effective tools.  For example, popup chat or pop-up.  Details about this we will write in our <a href="http://carrotquest.ru/blog/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_term%3Dsoldatov%26utm_content%3Dtrigger%26utm_campaign%3Demail-marketing">blog</a> .  If this information is useful to you, subscribe to the blog and save it to your bookmarks. <br><br><h4>  <b>B. We increase the conversion to the purchase of products of interest to the user.</b> </h4><br>  The situation is a bit more complicated and much more interesting when the user has viewed a number of products on the site, but has not logged in.  Few services can track a user in this case.  In this regard, <a href="http://carrotquest.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_term%3Dsoldatov%26utm_content%3Dtrigger%26utm_campaign%3Demail-marketing">Carrot Quest</a> gives freedom to maneuver.  The system always remembers the visitor and his actions (entered email, pressed a button, opened a page of a category or product, etc.).  You do not need to re-authorize a visitor to track his movements. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/99e/8be/188/99e8be188d861d3b72ce48df9bb521e7.png" alt="image02" width="708" height="569"></a> <br><br>  Users often browse products, services on sites (without having re-authorized).  They do not even think about authorization at this moment, why should they ...  Later, they simply forget about the pages and products they are browsing, as there are many distracting factors around.  Probably, if a user views the same product several times, then this product is of interest to him and he is considering a purchase option. <br><br>  You need to play on this.  Launch a trigger list for a segment of users who have viewed the same product more than once.  Thereby you will minimize the possibility of leaving the client to your competitors. <br><br>  If you do not use these chips, then some users will move to your more adventurous competitors. <br><br>  <strong>What can be offered in the case of viewed products:</strong> <br><ul><li>  Small discount (with limited time); </li><li>  Urgency (keep up while the goods are in stock); </li><li>  Free bonus (delivery, setup, etc.); </li><li>  Similar or related products. </li></ul><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/326/d16/f49/326d16f49252a58ec031ff35a568a38d.png" alt="image01" width="663" height="493"></a> <br><br>  There is another great option - you can write to the visitor, <b>even if you do not know his email</b> .  In <a href="http://carrotquest.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_term%3Dsoldatov%26utm_content%3Dtrigger%26utm_campaign%3Demail-marketing">Carrot Quest,</a> you can make the same offer via chat or pop-up. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/863/2f4/67c/8632f467cea91cd89f4cea79929cf74c.png" alt="image04" width="834" height="331"></a> <br><br><h3>  <b>2. We return visitors for re-purchase or how to increase the Retention rate.</b> </h3><br><br><br>  As you well know, "one old client is better than new two."  The cost of attracting a new client is often very high, so it is necessary to retain the existing ones and return the departed.  Most companies have a big problem at this stage.  Although there is nothing difficult in this and you can start improving the indicator right now. <br><br>  Right today, start counting CRR (customer retention rate) - customer retention rate.  Monitoring and working on this indicator will help you turn one-time customers into permanent ones, which will lower unit costs of attraction and increase profits. <br><br>  Most recently, we published an article on email remarketing, it will complement this and tell you about <a href="http://carrotquest.ru/blog/5-prostyx-strategij-email-remarketinga-dlya-povysheniya-ltv/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_term%3Dsoldatov%26utm_content%3Dtrigger%26utm_campaign%3Demail-marketing">5 simple user return strategies</a> . <br><br>  Next, we consider several options for returning users to the site. <br><br><h4>  <b>A. Additional products and services.</b> </h4><br>  Offers of similar or additional products are very relevant to customers.  For example, if a customer has purchased goods of the same brand in your store, you can offer him other products of the same brand and probably many will be interested.  If a client bought a Samsung speaker ("home theater") a month ago, then he might be interested in related products (TV, set-top box, headphones, etc.).  If you offer products of the same brand, involvement will be correspondingly higher. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/8c8/b00/0ca/8c8b000ca1ee64e0f3ced31bb4f928a7.png" alt="image03" width="500" height="400"></a> <br><br>  In our service, you can know about all the actions of the user, so configure the trigger mailings more subtly. <br><br>  You can set various variants of events and test them, after a while you will definitely determine the optimal list of events to which you need to react and select effective letters for different segments. <br><br>  So it looks like in our service: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/dd7/73e/eaf/dd773eeafa18cc2005b0954ba70d491c.png" alt="image06" width="1183" height="350"></a> <br><br><h4>  <b>B. Product Life Cycle.</b> </h4><br>  Pay particular attention to the life cycle of your product or service.  There are such goods that we will constantly buy: clothes, food, medicines, equipment, etc.  Think about how long your customer will need a new purchase?  If your product is periodically needed by a potential client, then you just need to try the next solution. <br><br>  Imagine you are selling t-shirts online.  Your data shows that 3% of customers who bought T-shirts come back after 6 months and make repeated purchases. <br><br>  There is an excellent solution for such a case.  Set up an automatic newsletter that will be sent to customers 5.5 months after the last purchase. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/eec/95f/5d5/eec95f5d5e307c22b3c5befced8b9b37.png" alt="image07" width="500" height="332"></a> <br><br>  This is an opportunity to increase the number of loyal customers.  Re-sell to customers who otherwise would not return.  Many of them will simply forget where they bought their t-shirt (even if they liked it very much).  After all, there are many other offers on the Internet. <br><br>  Remember that the main reason for unsubscribing is an excess of messages sent.  Therefore it is important to send letters on time.  And the main assistant in this is knowledge of the life cycle of your product. <br><br><br><br>  Trigger email marketing is a tool that is enough to set up and test just a few times, and it will continue to maintain high conversion all the time. <br><br>  Achieve fantastic conversions and don't lose your customers, especially twice.  If the client leaves the 2nd time, then he will never return. <br><br>  <strong>Your team from <a href="http://carrotquest.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_term%3Dsoldatov%26utm_content%3Dtrigger%26utm_campaign%3Demail-marketing">Carrot Quest</a> .</strong> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289818/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289818/</a></p>
