Photo hosting sites, which claim that they are ‚Äúfree‚Äù, but at the same time forget about this important degree of freedom, are ruthlessly screened out, but somewhere at the end of the review, links to the most popular ones are given.  Other important conditions for entering the list are not forgotten - reliability and storage time, usability and the absence of intrusive advertising.  Subsequently, it is worth choosing from the entire list of 5-7 most worthy and convenient hosting sites. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5e6/d48/4a0/5e6d484a038cd1531f614d70cfd5a8a1.png"><br><br>  The special cases for which this review is made are the publication of a certain image (pictures, drawings, photographs, screenshots, graphs) on other (not own) resources, especially where there are no solutions for publishing photos (Habr including) or they are inconvenient .  These are articles on foreign resources or in their blogs on foreign hosting (for example, blogger.com) with inconvenient or defective picture management, on online auctions, comments on blogs and forums.

      Hosting for this publication provides text links in the form of HTML-, BB-codes or direct links to the image and page view, preview (they are also thumbnails) of various sizes and a number of other amenities.  Consider them all and arrange the hosting found in descending order of averaged convenience.  At the end, as a bonus, links to some other online image preparation resources, which also follow the optional authorization rule. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><hr><br><h2>  Research history </h2><br>  Recently, some hosting was introduced for public advertising purposes, which caused a number of unobvious doubts about its respectability.  Meanwhile, ideas of using it as an image service for publishing on Habr√© were heard.  There was a counter-question: which image hosting, in particular, for Habr, is better to use? <br><br>  First, several hosting sites were investigated using the example of a single image.  It was found that the convenience of work for different hosting sites is different, and the results (by weight of the full picture, type and weight of the preview) are different.  It is not clear that in this ‚Äúindustry‚Äù there was a quality standard; everyone is striving for convenience and stop at different lines.  There are few reviews of hosting sites [1] (all of them are also important as evidence of their former reputation), give an answer only to some of the questions.  Therefore, it was decided to go into testing more thoroughly, to figure out what is really needed, by priorities, and what can be donated.  It turned out that there are not 5-10 suitable hosting sites, but 4 times more (about 30), despite the fact that it is 2 times more screened out (40-60).  The list of hosting does not claim to be complete and does not recommend anything to use - it simply cites data on the listed hosting, and the data speaks for itself.  It is likely that temporary unstable services got here and more worthy ones did not get.  Therefore, in the future, the table will sometimes be shuffled according to the results of checks. <br><br>  For example, in the future it is not bad to carry out load testing of each of the hosting sites [4], to make download attempts several times at different rush hours, to monitor the availability of each hosting for months.  All this, of course, is not done immediately.  We take advantage of the fact of publication, to then monitor the services and monitor the quality of storage. <br><br><h2>  Target service niche </h2><br>  They are not designed to show small service drawings of website design (some allow), for this purpose, regular universal hosting is used.  But they are trying to ensure the quality and reliability of displaying important for the user graphic information.  On the reliability of the show, even their own development hosting will lose to them in the long-term existence of the link. <br><br>  We are interested in hosting with some hard conditions.  For example, there is a mandatory authorization - then you can not watch (because there are enough hosting with the possibility of anonymous publishing).  Working only with the client program or inconvenience without it is the same.  No preview size options - great reasons to choose other alternatives.  Yes, and any restrictions of the free version of the account do not go to benefit, because they distract for unnecessary control: will my old photos not stop showing if any threshold is exceeded?  Nevertheless, they are worthy of consideration and choice of tastes. <br><br>  The required services are only a part of the overall image processing task.  The previous parts (editing, capturing) are not deliberately considered, although some editing may end up in the hosting service.  We will not look at too simplified and integrated services like gyazo.com, in which little attention is paid to the quality of details.  They are good for one-time viewing of screenshots by a small group of people, but they lack tools for publishing (for thousands of views and quality requirements).  Therefore, by default, we assume that we have a graphics editor and a screenshot taker, and without what they can do, we can do without. <br><br>  Image hosting is divided into photo hosting and, conditionally, technical image hosting.  If the first ones are focused on photographers and other ‚Äúordinary people‚Äù who may not have their own site, then the second ones suggest publishing photos (or screenshots, pictures) in blog or forum entries, and therefore do not seek to give their own gallery service for viewing.  The first are fully capable of working in the niche of the second.  Therefore, the strongest hosting in the world is designed for the first type - for all.  As payment, they all mostly limit free accounts in the rights and duration of storage.  We are interested in both reliability and non-restriction, so we will have to consider not only recognized leaders. <br><br>  We list, in descending order of priority, the necessary and desirable qualities of service.  At the beginning of the necessary, then under the line - desirable. <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Requirements </th><th>  Expanded notes to some requirements </th></tr><tr><td>  1) non-weight <b>optimization</b> (or at least <b>failure</b> to <b>use one‚Äôs own ‚Äúoptimization‚Äù of the</b> service with an increase in the weight of the original images or a change in quality) </td><td>  In the task bundle, point 1 is important - the absence of imposed optimization, because it is supposed to publish <b>for multiple impressions</b> , and the author is able to make a high-quality image.  In fact, if online Picasa gives a size 10 times worse than the source file and you can‚Äôt do anything about it (see PNG as an example), do you need such a program?  That optimization will require to leave the model ‚Äúin 1 program from gyazo.com - everything‚Äù to the model ‚Äú2-3 programs, but of high quality in one‚Äôs business‚Äù.  This controversial point is fundamental to the question of why we are looking for a service in this particular niche - only publication. </td></tr><tr><td>  2) <b>reliability of</b> shows (absence of short-term failures, including during peak hours) </td><td>  2) and 3): In 95% of cases, these 2 points are decisive.  Unreliable service is only suitable for instant display and only during ‚Äúfavorable hours‚Äù, i.e.  simply not needed.  But we will be able to evaluate these items only from reviews, indirect signs (for example, the presence of a business model) and experience. </td></tr><tr><td>  3) storage time </td><td>  (months and years of storage) </td></tr><tr><td>  4) work <b>without an account</b> </td><td>  (it is not always at hand the password or the desire to enter / receive it) </td></tr><tr><td>  5) <b>preview</b> with the choice of the size of the preview at the time of creation;  quality of parts in the preview and its weight </td><td>  1-2 fixed versions of decent previews will come down - the quality and weight of the previews themselves will be more important. </td></tr><tr><td>  6) <b>view full clean</b> images (without html and ads) </td><td>  It seems to be a violation of the business model, but the presence of this item, even with reputable services, says that it does not interfere too much with existence, but rather attracts customers. </td></tr><tr><td>  7) source <b>pictures - from computer</b> </td><td>  (there is an option when copying only from the web) </td></tr><tr><td>  - <i><font color="#aaaaaa">(optional)</font></i> - </td><td><hr></td></tr><tr><td>  8) <b>signing</b> or captioning (important is a good online optimization after signing) </td><td>  Signing will be important for the speed of publication - let us know how to use the editor or we have a good screenshot with the signatures, but the signatures on the previews are very useful, since the previews are created automatically. <br>  By the way, as a way to bypass the lack of previews, make 2 pictures in the editor and automatically (a plug-in in the browser) publish 2 images at once, then automatically link them in the pasted text.  Work, of course, more at the stage of creating 2 drawings.  Now, if the offline editor already knew how to cook a preview ... </td></tr><tr><td>  9) <b>source</b> pictures <b>from web</b> </td><td>  (not only from the computer) It is technically easy to implement, so having a copy from the web is an additional plus. </td></tr><tr><td>  10) <b>code</b> options <b>for publishing</b> (BB codes, HTML codes, clean link) </td><td> Conveniently, you can choose from all the options that may be needed, and the copying process is uncomplicated (for example, click + Ctrl-C, sometimes even just click, although it seems that this brute-force will erase something else important in the clipboard). </td></tr><tr><td>  11) <b>drawing</b> elements (frames, shadows, pencil) </td><td>  If it is already in the editor, it is not necessary, but it will be useful when either the editor is not there, or during subsequent editing. </td></tr><tr><td>  12) upload including <b>several files</b> </td><td>  (important for publishing large photo reports) </td></tr><tr><td>  13) <b>editing</b> without changing the storage address </td><td>  (it is necessary, when the link of the publication cannot be changed) </td></tr><tr><td>  14) <b>removal</b> from a hosting </td><td>  (Sometimes you need to delete your traces.) There are 2 options: non-authorization and keep an encrypted link for deletion / editing (in fact, a password) or authorization and without the need to store special links. </td></tr></tbody></table>  Finally, the review solves another strategic problem.  Such painstaking work would not be necessary if it were not for the task to embed the most successful and robust services in the plugin for Firefox / Chrome, in the future - for Opera.  Not only for Habr, where, of course, he is urgently needed, but generally as a universal plug-in (there are some for several Western services [2], but once repeated, it is qualitatively and with a comprehensive analysis).  Therefore, we will be interested in the presence of the <b>API</b> in the service. <br><br>  Of course, other ways are possible: 1) only a screenshoter that can edit within the necessary limits, like Ashampoo Magical Snap 2 + image hosting or 2) online flash editor + plug-in for screenshots in FF + image hosting with the ‚ÄúCrop (cropping)‚Äù function.  They are also sufficient for publications, but due to quality issues we will consider them to go beyond the scope of the article and research. <br><br><h2>  Preparation for testing </h2><br>  To determine the quality of image processing when saved on a hosting, take a few pictures of different types and genres.  Two screenshot PNG-8, one animated GIF, Two half-tone JPGs of different weights, one very large png with texts.  Total, 6 pictures.  They will measure the quality of compression and display previews.  We will get a clear picture of data storage on each of the hosting sites.  If it was possible to draw conclusions on 1-3 pictures, the rest were not uploaded to the hosting, therefore we have links from 1 to 6. <br><br>  The choice of PNG-8 only is due to the fact that PNG24 is disadvantageous in volume for photos with semitones (in most cases it is better to choose JPG), and hosting companies tend to save PNG type in PNG24 rather than PNG-8, therefore testing PNG-8 will help to reveal more flaws save operations. <br><br>  1-test-shotChromeExt.png - PNG-8, small screenshot, 892 h 1014, <b>37`452</b> bytes; <br>  2-test-oak.jpg - small photo, 517 x 317, <b>41`844</b> bytes; <br>  3-test-elfim.gif - test animated avatar, 128 x 96, <b>58`697</b> bytes; <br>  4-test-GerdArntz.png - PNG-8, big long screenshot, 1002 x 11`862, <b>1`099`246</b> bytes; <br>  5-test-river.jpg - large photo, 1996 x 2649, <b>1`272`068</b> bytes; <br>  6-test-austria-hungary.png - PNG-8, 2 color, wide map, 4463 x 3330, <b>828`732</b> bytes; <br><br>  It would be tempting to put on the page all the previews from the hosting sites, but we will not do this - even 1 preview (50 pictures) - this is a lot for 1 page.  Therefore, we will put here for clarity, 6 previews <a href="http://radikal.ru/">from one</a> good hosting, and all other links to the images of other providers will be through &lt;a href&gt;.  At any time, the reader will be able to manually verify the existence of a picture on the selected hosting by clicking on a link. <table><tbody><tr><th>  one </th><th>  2 </th><th>  3 </th><th>  4 <font color="#cc6666">*)</font> </th><th>  5 <font color="#cc6666">*)</font> </th><th>  6 <font color="#cc6666">*)</font> </th></tr><tr><th> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f1a/f84/661/f1af84661aa961bee66376983a27a61b.jpg" title="test-shotChromeExt.png, 37 KB"></a> <br></th><th> <a href=""><img src="http://s48.radikal.ru/i121/1003/c6/c51bb33a286ft.jpg" title="2-test-oak.jpg, 42 KB"></a> <br></th><th> <a href=""><img src="http://s003.radikal.ru/i204/1003/63/d98e054b26a2t.jpg" title="3-test-elfim.gif, 59 KB"></a> <br></th><th> <a href=""><img src="http://s004.radikal.ru/i205/1003/00/f48d10e882fbt.jpg" title="4-test-GerdArntz.png, 1.0 MB"></a> <br></th><th> <a href=""><img src="http://s003.radikal.ru/i201/1003/23/deb671543f7at.jpg" title="5-test-river.jpg, 1.2 MB"></a> <br></th><th> <a href=""><img src="http://s004.radikal.ru/i206/1003/f5/90c68478478ct.jpg" title="6-test-austria-hungary.png, 0.8 MB"></a> <br></th></tr><tr><td colspan="6">  <b><font color="#cc6666">*)</font></b> When clicking on 4, 5, 6, be careful: <b>traffic is about 1 MB</b> ! </td></tr></tbody></table>  We will provide the types of links: direct, to the screenshot, to the browse page, and, if available, some interesting features: gallery, preview options. <br><br><h2>  The list of studied hosts. </h2><br>  The comparison did not include some well-known, reliable, but not passed by some parameters hosting.

Next, do not forget to remove the checkbox for optimization and resize (there is a stepped resize).  No other settings.  Gives a series of texts for insertion, a preview (120x91), without statistics, without deletion.  Preview hassle-free, easy.  Those.  convenience is minimal, but everything is there, and hosting is very large, which deserves attention.  If on the page of viewing the image is reduced by means of html, then the cursor on it is ‚Äúhand‚Äù, and you need to click to view in full size.  Explicitly spelled out unlimited by the number of anonymous downloads and by the size of the pictures.  Misleading the extension ".jpg" and the like when displaying pages ".htm".  Enough for publications, it should be stable for impressions and does not have extra details on the preview page. <br><br>  The registration mode provides a number of other amenities: flash widgets for a site with a variable preview size.  But for some reason it is not clear how to upload a photo to an album (via the website) without compressing the dimensions and without processing.  Otherwise, the site looks like a place of communication level 2005-2006, plus blogs. <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://imageshack.us/">imageshack.us</a> <br><br>  <a href="">1</a> <a href="">2</a> <a href="">3</a> <a href="">5</a> <br>  preview <a href="">1</a> <a href="">2</a> <a href="">3</a> <a href="">5</a> <br>  page <a href="http://img682.imageshack.us/i/1testshotchromeext.png/">1</a> <a href="http://img232.imageshack.us/i/2testoak.jpg/">2</a> <a href="http://img101.imageshack.us/i/3testelfim.gif/">3</a> <a href="http://img13.imageshack.us/i/5testriver.jpg/">5</a> <br>  other design <a href="http://img682.yfrog.com/i/1testshotchromeext.png/">1</a> <br>  gallery <a href="http://img682.imageshack.us/gal.php%3Fg%3D1testshotchromeext.png">1-2-3</a> <br>  player <a href="http://img682.imageshack.us/slideshow/webplayer.php%3Fid%3D1testshotchromeext.png">1-2-3</a> <br>  A separate review is at the bottom of the article. <br></td><td>  The richest in capabilities of the services in question.
