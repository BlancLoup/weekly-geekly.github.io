  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Communication with technical support hosters</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> I am writing this article as an employee of a small hosting company.  Everything written in the article is not the opinion of the company, but my opinion as a technical support employee as a whole.  Much of what is written is the experience of my colleagues from other companies.  Probably for some, I am writing quite obvious things.  However, very often I encounter negative news on forums (which is no secret - and also on Habr√©) regarding the work of technical support of a hosting provider.  This note will allow you to avoid unpleasant situations in communicating with us, and just answer some questions "why so and not otherwise?" <br><br>  Immediately make a reservation that I did not come across clients, communication with which would resemble a great call to technical support for stream - all of our customers are adequate.  It can be said that my mind is not clouded with hatred of users.  I never had to be nervous at work, after the change I always have a great mood.  Maybe only want to sleep a little more than just after a night in front of the monitor.  I work both day and night - accordingly I will take into account the features and round-the-clock work of technical support. <br><br>  I do not take into account the really "bad" employees.  For me, a real tech support employee is a young system administrator in a spherical vacuum, whose experience so far does not allow him to become an administrator.  About the "blondes" also mention.

      UPD: In the comments, many express a somewhat strange point of view about the article.  This is not a direct instruction for action.  <b>This is a set of tips that will help you get a benevolent attitude from technical support specialists.</b> <br>  Also, do not confuse the <b>technical support</b> and <b>help services of the host</b> in this article. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The first thing to do after checking in to a hosting service is to find out the schedule of technical support.  If not written on the site - there is a small trick.  We go to the vacancy and see what schedule is offered to young employees like "assistant system administrator" or "technical support specialist".  Believe me, no director will pay the full-fledged system administrator for night shifts - it's just expensive.  And the efficiency of administrators working at night is decreasing.  Therefore, if a salary of 40.000+ is offered for round-the-clock schedules - do not pay attention.  This is most likely just an administrator on duty who deals exclusively with the performance of the hosting service at night.  Exceptions are, but not so often. <br><br>  The next step is to find out what the first line of technical support is.  There are 3 cases here.  If hosting is large, blondes or inexperienced students sit on the first line and they will not help you much.  Such firewalls.  They are taken in order to weed out telephone spammers, send them to manuals and reply ‚Äútechnical work is being done on your server‚Äù.  The second case - the first line of support consists of assistant system administrators.  In my opinion - the perfect case.  80% of the problems you can solve at the first level in this case.  The third case - on the hosting there are only system administrators. <br>  You can find out the necessary information, again, on the page with vacancies or it is trivial to inquire from the technical support service itself. <br>  Why do you need this information?  In the first case, you can write-call technical support for any adequate question - this is rather a reference.  Their job is included in the cost of hosting.  But do not overdo it - they are people too and they want and relax in the workplace.  But if you have a technical problem - you have to describe it in a clear language for a long time and diligently - according to the instructions, they will try to help you, until they understand that they will not cope.  In the second case - you can already throw in the forehead technical terms and slang.  Yes, it is indecent, but they will understand you.  Distinctive features of such support is the habit to communicate with references to manuals and solve your problems ‚Äúwithout departing from the cash register‚Äù.  It is convenient for you - your problem, even of high complexity, is solved by one person.  You should not be offended by the links - usually the load in such a support for each employee is high and there is simply no time to paint with your hands.  The third case is the worst, but economical.  In fact, it implies the absence of any help in setting up something on the part of the company's employees - they respond only to the phrase ‚Äúthe server has fallen!‚Äù, Reluctantly answer the rest over a cup of coffee, and sometimes the next day. <br><br>  It would be nice to know how long the staff should respond to you.  We have this time - 15 minutes.  If you do not respond clearly longer - it is worth reminding about yourself. <br><br>  If you decide to call - just call the contract number or your account number in the system.  Calling a login by phone is not worth it.  Describe the problem clearly and in brief, the necessary questions will be asked.  If your problem is described in the ticket / letter - call its number. <br><br>  Well, finally it is worth knowing exactly what is the responsibility of technical support.  It means ‚Äúfree‚Äù.  In fact, some of our work is included in the cost of services.  But there are cases when extended technical support is provided for a fee.  Why know this?  You will know what problem it is worth writing to the support, and which one is better to go to Google.  If you ask to dig deeper into your VDS without paying for the administration services, you can be helped.  But the task will have a very low priority and its solution will be delayed for a long time. <br><br>  We now turn to the explanation of some features of the technical support of a spherical mid-size hoster.  I will build this part in the form of question-answer. <br><br>  Q: Why on the site indicate ICQ and / or Skype technical support? <br>  A: Believe me, this is not for you to ask you to remind you of a password or make changes to the configuration.  It is worth asking general questions here (what's the software, where is the pimp in your panel, and does $ php_module_name work for you).  In general, here it is worth knocking on issues not related specifically to your account.  It is also worth sending messages like "$ server_name fell" here.  But in no case is ‚Äú$ domain_name not working for me‚Äù.  Remember, you are not identified as a client when you write in conventional IM. <br>  Exceptions are the creation of a ticket (writing a letter) of the form ‚ÄúI need IM communication with administrators for making important changes, my ICQ is &lt;set of 5-9 digits&gt;, now I will write to you‚Äù.  But, usually, this is possible in those cases when you pay for the server administration services - for example, to explain to the system administrator a ‚Äústep-by-step‚Äù operation and conduct it quickly. <br><br>  Q: Why does the site indicate the phone? <br>  A: Everything is relevant here too, which is relevant for ICQ and others.  With the only proviso that by phone, usually, you can directly reach the accounting department if you are a representative of legal entities.  faces.  In no case do not call with the words "connect me with the director!".  You must know his first name and last name and have a reason to be connected with him.  You will be asked about this reason. <br><br>  Q: Why on the phone with me trying to end the conversation earlier than I want? <br>  A: Your problem is not so important to communicate with you by phone.  Either an employee of the company sees that all other employees are also busy talking on the phone and no one can take the next call. <br><br>  Q: Why aren't you introducing yourself? <br>  A: You, as a customer, call not a specific Vasya Pupkin, but a company with which you have an agreement.  If you introduce yourself, I will introduce myself too, if you start a discussion right off the bat, then apparently you don‚Äôt care who, but how quickly fix the problem.  However, the most reliable way for everyone to communicate is to write a customer ticket (letter) for technical support. <br><br>  Q: Why do you not use the pace of decency like "hello, goodbye"? <br>  A: We use them in the form of templates.  No, we could spend 20% of our time typing such words from the keyboard.  But this time. <br><br>  Q: Why do they communicate with me as if I am a system administrator? <br>  A: You use Hi-Tech services.  You are buying a technical platform, not technical support.  In particular, if you pay for hosting a hundred or two rubles a month. <br><br>  Q: I bought a domain from another hoster and I can not ‚Äútie‚Äù it to your server. <br>  A: Technical support for one hoster is not involved in explaining anything related to another hoster.  No, we will certainly explain how to use the panel Reg.ru or ru-center.  But we have hardly ever seen the domain control panel ‚Äúout of the site that sells domains for 100 rubles‚Äù. <br><br>  I will be happy to answer other questions from the comments and add them to the article. <br><br>  We turn to the third part of the article.  Your mistakes, as a customer, and how to avoid them.  Yes, this part is a little sarcastic, many will seem ridiculous.  But this is all - from my experience and the experience of colleagues.  If you recognize yourself in one of the errors considered, know that you did not read the article for nothing. <br><br>  1) Call by phone with the words "Hello, I place your site abracadabra and ...". <br>  Yes - for you this site may be ‚Äúabracadabra‚Äù, but for us it may well be the site abrocadabra.  It is difficult to perceive the name of sites on the phone. <br><br>  2) Call by phone with the words ‚ÄúI would like to change (password | settings | tariff), delete data, refuse services‚Äù. <br>  Remember when you call by phone - you are not our client until we are 100% sure <br><br>  3) Call by phone at night. <br>  No, of course there are big hosters, where at night a crowd of systems is on duty.  admins and they are happy to talk to you in a half awake voice.  But you yourself need it?  Is your problem really that important?  Maybe we should wait until 10 in the morning?  No, if the server is down, make sure to call, but if you can‚Äôt find the button in the dashboard, it‚Äôs better just write a ticket / letter  Or search better, especially in conventional panels like ISPmanager or Plesk. <br><br>  4) Call by phone. <br>  Good technical support consists of a class of people who prefer to print something instead of bothering to turn the tongue.  In addition, we will know exactly who you are and what our services you use.  And what they wrote before. <br><br>  5) Use technical support as google. <br>  You bought hosting for 100 rubles a month and think that you are now obliged to answer absolutely every question?  You can not read about how to install Drupal?  You can not find reference information on the site host?  Perhaps you should consider hiring an administrative programmer. <br><br>  6) Contact technical support with the requirements of the form ‚Äúcreate an FTP account for me, create an SQL database for me, restore me a backup‚Äù. <br>  Most likely, this is not our responsibility.  You can do it yourself.  If we are "not in the scrap" - we will do.  But be prepared to go for a walk in Google or the information section on the site.  Or buy administration services.  If you can not do it yourself - that is, the hoster does not provide such features in the panel - then, okay, we will do it. <br><br>  7) Do not answer technical support questions. <br>  You wrote "and restore my backup"?  Be prepared for what you ask.  And do not go to sleep after this phrase.  Did you write about getting an additional IP?  Be prepared for asking you why you need it (hello, new RIPE rules on issuing IP addresses) and asking again - are you ready to pay for it or additionally something else (hello Flexei-Pack from hetzner) <br><br>  8) In the middle of the night, ask technical support for changing the tariff or connecting an additional service.  Or that you would be sent a contract.  Or the act of providing services. <br>  In a good company there are managers for this.  And accounting.  And they work during the day.  Usually - from 10 to 18. If there are no managers and accounting ... Then yes - to you for technical support.  Or in the billing panel (hello, oh great billmgr). <br><br>  9) In the middle of the night, contact technical support with requests like "I need to make important changes to the server configuration."  Even if you pay for administration services. <br>  In addition to the fact that even a good specialist can make mistakes right away at night - at night, high-class specialists rarely work.  They sleep in a warm bed with his wife or girlfriend.  Therefore, your changes will be made by the next beginner system.  admin  If you need to make changes at night - write in advance during working hours.  You will clarify all the details, the night shift will be instructed. <br><br>  10) Contact technical support in the early morning. <br>  This is the worst for many professionals.  If the shift lasts from 20.00 to 8.00 - then by 4-6 in the morning the brain is almost off, honestly.  Not because of the duration of the shift, even, but simply because it is early morning.  Better wait for the morning / afternoon shift. <br><br>  11) Write letters consisting of the words ‚Äúthank you‚Äù, ‚Äúgoodbye‚Äù, ‚Äúhello, how are you?‚Äù <br>  Remember - any ticket / technical support letter must carry information.  Formally, we must respond to every letter.  And how do we respond to the letter "goodbye"?  And just takes time.  If you want to seem polite - write "Yes, thank you, everything works." Or "Yes, thanks, I was able to log in through the FTP account created."  Semantic load is, we have something to answer, you showed your politeness. <br><br>  12) Try to leave your message last in the ticket. <br>  If you have nothing to say - just say nothing.  We often have instructions - the ticket can be closed only if the last message is a message from our specialist. <br><br>  13) Use translators to communicate with foreign technical support.  (or a foreigner to communicate with Russian) <br>  If the contract / website does not indicate exclusive languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat should be used when contacting technical support - write in your own language and add a phrase like "Sorry i don't know russian, i wrote in spain language".  We'd rather use the translators ourselves.  Or maybe we have a person who studies Spanish.  But to read the incidents of Google translate when translating from Spanish to Russian - dismiss ... Oh yes - be prepared for the fact that you answer in English and you yourself have to use a translator. <br><br>  14) Scream, swear, write angry letters, swear. <br>  Honestly - I don't care about all this.  I will calmly listen, say ‚Äúsorry, write to the post office, goodbye‚Äù and hang up.  My nerves are more precious to me.  Want an employee to be punished?  Write to.  Create a ticket, write to the mail administrators and so on.  We are not obliged to grovel before those who do not know the banal rules of decency.  No, of course we are obliged to comply with the terms of the contract, but it also does not say that we should read or listen to your vocabulary. <br><br>  15) "Connect me with the director!" <br>  Director in the company in order to manage the company, and not in order to communicate with customers.  You can safely send all the necessary information to the technical support service - they will give it to him. <br><br>  16) Offer your services by phone. <br>  No matter what services you offer.  Avoid calls to hosters.  Out of a couple of hundred telephone spammers, I did not send to the next subscriber only one - the one who offered to add our hosting button to the QIWI terminals.  But in fact, if we needed it, we would call the QIWI representatives ourselves. <br><br>  17) Ask to call the employee over to the telephone. <br>  Well, firstly, it may be trite to be in the office.  Secondly - it could be the head of the department, you just got through the moment when everyone was busy. <br><br>  18) ‚ÄúI'm tired of repeating my problem on the phone to each employee!‚Äù <br>  Take advantage of mail / tickets.  We are not psychics at all and cannot telepathically explain to the manager what the client, whom we have just kicked, wants from them. <br><br>  19) My DS / VDS is not working as I need! <br>  We can only reinstall your OS.  And no, we will not save any files.  I do not like?  All hosters have a button ‚Äúpay for advanced administration services‚Äù <br><br>  20) But yesterday I had a backup available for the 10th number, but today it is not!  And nukabysheverneme !!! 111 <br>  Well was.  Well swum.  Well, we disabled the backup server, because we plug a new hdd into it.  And maybe they just deleted your backup.  Are you sure that in the contract (in the description of the service) it is precisely stated that backups are part of the hosting services?  Many hosters do them for themselves, in case the server goes down.  And for you leave access to them simply as a nice addition. <br><br>  21) My site gives the error "$ incomprehensible_code_of_ error" <br>  We are admins, not web developers.  Tell us what you need to fix the error, and not what kind of error.  Or pay for the services of our developer. <br><br>  22) A month ago, I transferred the site to Drupal to you, and now I saw that nothing but the main page was working. <br>  Put in place .htaccess.  And if you do not have it - find it.  We will not write it again.  And in general - it was worth contacting earlier. <br><br>  23) If you transfer me a site from that hosting to you - I will be your client. <br>  (In no case, this item does not apply to small hosting sites - I have noticed for a long time that if you enter the first couple of hundreds of clients, you will be treated very well) <br>  This will help you if you are going to rent an expensive VDS or just a dedicated server.  Maybe it will help.  But in general - we do not care.  You are just another customer.  Maybe we are good and will transfer.  Or maybe we are all busy. <br><br>  24) I want to host your site for free, and on the main one - hang your banner. <br>    .     ‚Äî . <br>       , ‚Ä¶    IT- . <br><br> ,       .   ‚Äî                 ‚Äî ,  ,     .       ,    .
