I continue to talk about the letters in the blog of Michael, the owner of Textbroker. <br><br>  So, the urgent need for thank-you letters happens after something ends.  For example, a meeting or event.  Or a contract.  In general, you need to say thanks for this episode (so as not to look like a freak) and more, it is advisable to get a couple of bonus points. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Here are the bonus points and do. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Thank You Letter Structure </h4><br>  <b>The usual structure is:</b> <br><ol><li>  Thank you, good fairies, it was cool. </li><li>  We hope for further cooperation. </li></ol><br>  Well, this is usually expressed in the "Company thanks for the excellent performance ..." and other nonsense.  It works, it is part of old business etiquette, and often that is enough.  But you can do much better, right on the head. <br><br>  To do this, you need to understand why a thank-you letter is written at all.  As a rule, there are several tasks: <br><ul><li>  Act on etiquette. </li><li>  Make it clear that everything was fine. </li><li>  Exchange achivkami. </li><li>  Memorized person "on the wrong side." </li><li>  Say "thank you" publicly. </li><li>  Once again remind myself of a piece on the wall of the office. </li></ul><br>  Therefore, I propose to do a little differently. <br><br>  <b>Other structure, more cunning</b> <br><ol><li>  First, thank for what was.  And show specifics.  Only if in the old letter you used the official wording and thanked in general, then it is necessary to note the general organization of the process and give one or two examples with specific details.  For example, the last time when we organized a large-scale photography, this detail was the perfect coordination of models - no one continued, and everyone was on time.  Such details are very important both for ‚Äúthanksgiving‚Äù and for reviews.  By the way, as a matter of fact, a thank-you letter and a review, for example, on Yandex.Market, are built in the same way.  But more about that later. </li><li>  Then talk about how it went with you.  If you were doing an event at the site of the one you thank, then you briefly tell you that everything was great.  This is a feedback showing that you are satisfied.  Suddenly, it is important. </li><li>  Constructively criticize.  This is the thinnest and most important part that is usually missed.  First of all, it is very important not to hurt non-constructive offensive criticism - after all, the letter‚Äôs task is a little different.  Secondly, this part is needed to show that you do not care what and how in general, and you want to improve and help.  Our formula proven over the years is: ‚ÄúEverything was fine, but next time let's do it this way and that way‚Äù (for example, we add chairs, because there are more people than planned).  At this moment you will receive two things at once: the person will remember that the next time you will do even better (and will call you again), and in general will think about the next time.  And mentally put you there. </li><li>  Give thanks personally.  This, too, many people forget.  It is necessary to thank the person for what he did personally on the spot, noting some kind of success, like: ‚ÄúWhen the power was turned off, Irina was able to restore everything in 6 minutes - so promptly they did not react on any site.‚Äù  By the way, if you send a letter on the form physically, do not be lazy and send two - one to the company, the second to the person.  Your contact will be just nice.  Well, I even saw how such things were applied to the resume. </li></ol><br>  Well, and then the rest - we hope for cooperation and so on. <br><br><h4>  See what you did: </h4><br><ul><li>  Worked on etiquette </li><li>  One more compliment to your contact. </li><li>  They showed specifics, that is, they showed that this is not a reply. </li><li>  Gave helpful feedback </li><li>  Showed what can be done better </li><li>  Laid their next partnership in the mind of contact </li></ul><br>  Everything.  You are wonderful. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298698/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298698/</a></p>
