  <section class="page js-page"><h1>SmartProgress Launches Mentoring Platform</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>What to do when you do not know how to approach the solution of an important task, and among friends and acquaintances there is no one who could help you with it?</i>  <i>Write a post on the Internet.</i> <br><br>  No, really.  <a href="https://smartprogress.do/">The service to achieve the goals of SmartProgress</a> does just that: you formulate your goal and share your experience all along, communicating with like-minded people along the way.  But not all goals are achievable alone: ‚Äã‚Äãthat is why we launched a new functionality - <a href="https://smartprogress.do/site/coaching/">group programs for achieving goals under the guidance of a mentor</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/310/65a/6d7/31065a6d7a7f45ba8df4b44210b95d98.jpg"><br>  <i>Now achieving goals can be done as a team work.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The Evolution platform (code name) can be safely called an analogue of the App Store for mentoring, only this service is intended to host programs for group training.  Just like in the App Store, Evolution users will be able to view reviews from other people who have previously bought a mentoring program as part of achieving their own goals, and evaluate their effectiveness through a rating system.  All this information is available in the profile of trainers and their courses.  It also shows the duration of the course.

      SmartProgress users can sign up for a course, pay money and follow the trainer's assignments.  The platform is the arbiter of the quality of the course.  This means that if the client receives poor-quality services (his coach does not complete the task that was set at the beginning of the course), then such a client will get his money back in full.  Users of SmartProgress received two new incentives to help them achieve their goals.  This is, in fact, the trainer-mentor and colleagues in the group. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e31/305/402/e31305402224453badc3a2e2a8adb872.jpg"><br><br><h3>  <font color="0685f9">‚ÄúEvolution‚Äù for customers or How is learning and achieving goals</font> </h3><br>  The main thing that the SmartProgress client should do for itself is to formulate goals for itself and fix them on the SmartProgress.do website.  Achieving the goal - a task that faces the user of the system.  However, in a group program a person can get help with this from the coach and fellow students.  Collective work on achieving goals under the control of a trainer will help you not to go astray, find the best way, and not ‚Äúwander among the three pines‚Äù. <br><br><h3>  <font color="0685f9">Why do I need a coach?</font> </h3><br><blockquote>  I believe that every project, and, in general, every person needs a mentor - a more experienced person who has already traveled a certain path that you just embark on. <br>  <i>- Igor Bogachev, Executive Director of the Information Technology Cluster of the Skolkovo Foundation</i> </blockquote><br>  Mentoring is one of the most important ways of learning something invented by man.  Pushkin had Derzhavin, Alexander the Great - Aristotle, and Plato - Socrates. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f34/73d/4c8/f3473d4c85684bccb4d8ab4ba97b5c70.jpg"><br><br>  As part of the mentorship program, the trainer will conduct webinars, give homework assignments and monitor their implementation and the activity of the service user as a whole using his monitoring functionality.  Thanks to this, the coach will see the activity of each user and how he is working on his goals.  Control by such a mentor is a very useful thing for many people in need of external control. <br><br>  Publishing a diary to achieve goals available to the user and his coach, not only disciplines, but also helps to better understand their goals and the way to achieve them.  At the same time, if the user stops publishing reports and doing homework, this means that he is no longer ready to work towards the realization of his dream - he is eliminated from further work <br><br><h3>  <font color="0685f9">Collective interaction</font> </h3><br>  The new features of SmartProgress include the communication of users in groups, the discussion of the problems of participants in group programs and the achievement of goals.  Thus, in addition to the ‚Äúmentor-student‚Äù connection, the ‚Äústudent-student‚Äù connections are formed in the groups.  This allows you to communicate with the same people motivated for success, help them and, in turn, be charged with their positive attitude, motivation, faith in success.  And the ability of users to see the progress of other participants in the goal achievement program will motivate, communication with them will inspire further achievements. <br><br>  For coaches and mentors, the new functions of SmartProgress are an opportunity to take your business to a new level, get new customers, expand the geography of their students.  If you want to become a mentor - leave a <a href="https://smartprogress.do/site/evolution">request</a> . <br><br>  The novelty will improve the achievement of results by SmartProgress clients.  Working under the guidance of a mentor will allow you to avoid mistakes, help you quickly choose the right path for yourself and at the right time get important advice, help, advice or even a ‚Äúkick‚Äù in the right direction. <br><br> <a href="https://smartprogress.do/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/52b/7d4/88b/52b7d488b26969ab5e60319395742893.jpg" align="left"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291076/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291076/</a></p>
