Those.  if you once were interested in a particular product on a specific site that uses remarketing, you will most likely encounter a lot of advertising banners for this product on other sites. <br><br><img src="http://mannakasha.com/wp-content/uploads/remarketing2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Who can use retargeting?</b>

    <ul><li>  Online store direct sale.  If you sell socks, tanks or services of Filipino housekeepers, and payment occurs directly on your site. </li><li>  Site business card shop.  In this case, the final conversion on your site is a visit to the contact page and, accordingly, a call (letter, meeting, etc.). </li><li>  Informational portal.  It can be a blog, a news resource, a political party site ‚Äî conversion in this case are measurable indicators of traffic, returns, depth, and viewing time;  immeasurable - brand, noise and voice in the elections. </li></ul><br><br>  Why is it important to understand where of these groups you are?  Because the sales funnel, conversion goals and measurement tools in each of them are fundamentally different, respectively, and the approach in the application of retargeting will be different. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Online store.</b> <br><br>  Here, the sales funnel is the most capable of turning into a pipe from all other groups.  Traffic is mainly chased from contextual advertising, banner, search results, social networks, message boards, etc.  Lida in this group are of the highest quality, because  often come on target requests.  Of course, if you are a large online trading network or an avid moneymaker, then probably your funnel is much wider at the entrance than at most other stores (while your leads are not so high-quality, but there are many times more). <br><br>  Often, each store can be divided into <b>several stages of the transformation of the lead:</b> <br><br>  1. Site homepage or login page. <br><br>  2. Long viewing of a specific product or section in the magazine. <br><br>  3. Filling the basket. <br><br>  4. Attempt to pay (for example, click on the button to pay). <br><br>  5. ThankU page that appeared after the payment. <br><br>  At each of these stages lead can break off the hook and leave (except the last).  To minimize this, we are talking about retargeting. <br><br>  The main mistake of most stores is a universal approach to all leads at all stages. <br><br>  <b>How correct ???</b> <br><br>  Your task is not just to return the person to the site, but to return him to where he was staying and was interested.  If the exit level was at the first stage - we return it to the first stage, if the lead has already filled the basket - we return it to the site with the basket already filled, etc ... <br><br>  Also, an excellent approach is to return a person to the landing page (the page was created for each of the stages), where he will be offered such conditions that he cannot refuse: <br><br><ul><li>  promotional items, discounts, special offers; </li><li>  where objections will be worked out; </li><li>  where will be access to online chat with support; </li><li>  where will the right call to action; </li></ul><br><br>  and most importantly - the button to go to the next stage (or ‚Äúbuy‚Äù or ‚Äúlearn more about the product‚Äù).  And ideally, you will remove his contact details, and the sales department will take up this lead (regarding steps # 3 and # 4). <br><br>  After the entire sales cycle, when the payment was successful and the lead turned into your customer, you can not stop!  Retargeting can be a great cross-sell tool and help customers put a needle on your store forever. <br><img src="http://mannakasha.com/wp-content/uploads/Retargeting-1-.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Online business card.</b> <br><br>  In this case, there is nothing to buy on the spot, so the goal will be any contact of the lead with the company (call, letter, visit to the offline store).  Therefore, there can not do without a product-gift (discount, book, etc.), which will be valuable (as information or a material thing for a lead).  Get such a ‚Äúgift‚Äù lead in exchange for contacts (phone number, mail and name).  How to apply it in remarketing? <br><br>  Stages of the formation of the lead at the site business cards: <br><br>  1. Site homepage or login page. <br><br>  2. View services / products. <br><br>  3. Contact page. <br><br>  If the lead is gone after level 1, then we will return it according to the standard retargeting scheme - to the main page.  We will apply the scheme described above to the leads that were ‚Äúnoted‚Äù at stages ‚Ññ2 and ‚Ññ3.  It is to these leads that we will broadcast announcements, for example, ‚Äúreceive a gift‚Äù, which will lead to the landing page.  Next, we remove the contacts in exchange for the product zamanuha and transfer them to the sales department for a ping. <br><br>  <b>How it might look:</b> <br><br>  <i>Website business card beauty "U Elena".</i>  <i>The site has pages about services, a ‚Äúabout salon‚Äù page and a ‚Äúcontacts‚Äù page (and others).</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Users who have left the site from the main page will immediately see ads like ‚ÄúPick up your super hairstyle‚Äù (these are users of stage 1) and go to the main page of the site.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Lida who viewed the pages ‚Äúcontacts‚Äù and ‚Äúservices‚Äù will see the following advertisement: ‚Äúget a catalog of hairstyles for spring-summer 2013 for free!‚Äù.</i>  <i>By clicking on the ad, the user will be offered to receive an electronic super-catalog of hairstyles, which will be sent to an e-mail address for free.</i>  <i>To do this, just leave contacts.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  Thus, we will complete the main conversion - we will get the contact of the person with whom the sales department will work. <br><br>  <b>Informational portal.</b> <br><br>  Using retargeting for this type of resources may seem dubious, however, in some cases, the costs of attracting high-quality traffic using remarketing may be relevant to fit into the marketing concept.  What can we say, Barack Obama in his last election campaign actively used return advertising for visitors to his site.  Also, well-known online hydrometeorological centers and large news portals use this technology more than actively. <br><br>  The main question is the following - what bait will we catch on the Internet users who have left our site?  It's very simple - on the content! <br><br>  Often, on sites of this type a lot of content.  It is good when it is segmented (for example, by headings, topics, etc.).  Even better if this content is constantly updated.  And it's just amazing if it's interesting for people.  If you have all this - well, you can proceed. <br><br>  Target advertising, we will once again on the parameters of headings (or similar) on the site.  A user who has read policy news on your site will see announcements about a new policy article.  Those who were interested in the economy - respectively.  In the case of a weather forecast site, you will see a suggestion to familiarize yourself with forecasts based on your geography.  And so on ... <br><br>  For informational portals, retargeting is expensive and not always cost-effective.  But with the right strategy development, you can ‚Äúadd‚Äù users to your site, and they will already be directly accessing you to get news. <br><br>  /// <br><br>  Actually, that's how and where you can apply <a href="http://mannakasha.com/marketing/marketingpovedenia/">retargeting</a> .  The main thing is to understand the mechanism itself, since  algorithms here simply can not be.  For each individual site, for each individual company should be an individual plan and strategy.  I tried to recreate the basic mechanics, on the basis of which you will be able to develop your own retargeting campaigns.  I hope the material was useful and interesting for you! <br><img src="http://mannakasha.com/wp-content/uploads/retargeting-1.jpeg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296992/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296992/</a></p>
