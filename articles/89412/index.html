      Overmobile LLC is a developer of popular online mobile phone games with a daily audience of over 100,000 visitors, a partner of cellular operators in Russia and the CIS countries, as well as the largest mobile portals. <br><br>  In our opinion, such investigative measures are not justified and should not lead to a halt of sites.  Otherwise, such actions of law enforcement agencies impede and threaten any development of legal business in RuNet and small business in Russia.  We intend to assert our rights and the rights of all our clients. <br><br>  <i>Dmitry Komlev</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Director of Overmobile LLC</i> <br><br>  <b>Added by the initiative of <a href="http://iiiyt.habrahabr.ru/">IIIyT</a></b> : <br>  <a href="http://iiiyt.habrahabr.ru/blog/89435/">iiiyt.habrahabr.ru/blog/89435/</a> here I made a proposal for assistance in these situations. ... if the initiative finds support, we can at least help you. <br><habracut><br><br>  <b>Update 3/31/10 14:20:</b> <br>  The paradox of the current state of affairs is that the investigators, who left for Moscow, decided to inspect the glammy.ru service of interest on the spot, directly at the site of the hosting provider.  And the server of the game Barbara, who has no relation to the Glammy service, they seized for examination in Novosibirsk.  At the same time, it is not known when they will give him to us and we will probably have to take him to Moscow.  I think it makes no sense to say that for an online game the monthly simple does not bode well. <br><br>  At the same time, the investigator admits that the sudtradniki exceeded their authority and they should not have withdrawn the server, but could not do anything. <br><br>  The investigators do not respond to the calls of lawyers.  Our calls are answered that we interfere with their work. <br><br>  And we now have no other job, except to call them. <br><br>  <b>Update 04/01/10 15:20:</b> <br><br>  Access to the server glammy.ru restored.  Thanks to Sky-Media company (skyme.ru) for not giving the server and letting AT Directorate OD staff to copy the information in place. <br><br>  The server barbars.ru, withdrawn from the Caravan, has not yet been returned.  Moreover, they promised not to give up "before the court." <br><br>  It's funny, the "porn server" was returned, and the server with the game, on which even the avatar cannot be filled in, is not given. <br><br>  It looks unreasonable if you do not take into consideration the fact that the game of Barbara is the main source of income for the company. </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/89412/">https://habr.com/ru/post/89412/</a></p>
