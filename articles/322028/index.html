We will find out how smoking can help in the fight for health, and what is useful in sanitary norms, rules and state standards.

     <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/322028/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/74e/860/531/74e860531a444cc4b065ef5858619a3d.jpg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a>  <i>Photo Wikimedia / <a href="">Zonaspace</a> / <a href="">CC</a></i> <br><br><h2>  Myth 1: Seated work is a direct path to health problems. </h2><br>  A sedentary lifestyle leads to an increase in pressure on the intervertebral discs, a weakening of the muscular system, and if you sit incorrectly, you are also guaranteed a curvature of the posture and chronic pain in the back, neck and wrists. <br><br>  All this can be avoided if you make some effort and follow the elementary rules that are <a href="http://www.gosthelp.ru/text/RD153340032982001Tipovaya.html">spelled out</a> even in the instructions on labor protection. <br><br>  Briefly for those who are too lazy to read the full version: <br><br><ul><li>  do not slouch; </li><li>  do not bend the spine in the lower part of the back; </li><li>  do not sit with your legs crossed; </li><li>  do not cross your feet; </li><li>  find a head position in which the neck is least tired; </li><li>  Try to think about keeping the right angles in the elbow, hip, knee and ankle joints. </li></ul><br>  The position and height of the table, chairs, tilt angles and the height of the monitor coasters, for legs and papers, greatly affects the difficulty of executing even the simplest advice.  Of course, all this is strictly regulated, including sanitary rules and regulations. <br><br>  According to the universal <a href="http://www.gosthelp.ru/text/SanPiN22254296Gigieniches.html">requirements, the</a> chair must maintain a rational posture and allow you to change the position to reduce the tension of the muscles of the neck and back.  And in Appendix 17 and 18 of the above instructions on labor protection can be found with a selection of exercises that can be performed even in the office. <br><br>  Just sit straight for 8, or even 12 hours a day, no one will succeed without strengthening the muscles.  At work there is not always a place where you can retire for such exercises.  But even short breaks and walking can help.  Here, smokers have a peculiar advantage, since they need to walk to the street or a specially equipped smoking area, and this is quite a good warm-up and a change of scenery. <br><br>  Although <a href="https://hr.superjob.ru/kadrovyj-uchet/kurit-ili-ne-kurit-vo-vremya-rabochego-dnya-i-kto-oplachivaet-vremya-perekura-561/">not all</a> employers want to pay for the smoke breaks of their employees, in most cases smokers are easier to get permission for such a ‚Äúwalk‚Äù than for non-smokers who just want to warm up.  But in any case, to avoid health problems during sedentary work is quite realistic, if you apply maximum effort to this. <br><br><h2>  Myth 2: Lying down is bad </h2><br>  Some programmers working from home consider the opportunity to work directly in bed to be a great convenience.  But it is rather harmful for the spine, moreover, in such a position, the hands get tired faster and the neck stiffens.  Although today comfortable work in the supine state is no longer a myth, if you use <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/10/28/technology/altwork-chair/">this chair</a> . <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-fng-yJ_weE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The bottom line is that it is designed so that the person is really comfortable (although something resembles a dental chair).  Developers of such a chair-bed note that direct users noticeably increase the level of psychological comfort (of course, only if you don‚Äôt look at the price of the gadget) <br><br><h2>  Myth 3: Standing Tables for Work - Solving All Problems </h2><br>  Today in the west, standing tables are becoming increasingly popular.  It is believed that this format of work increases productivity and eliminates problems with the spine, reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases and in general is a magical remedy for all diseases.  Experts say that certain problems can be avoided, but in return <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/03/17/470713717/stand-to-work-if-you-like-but-dont-brag-about-its-benefits">to get</a> others, for example, varicose veins. <br><br>  Therefore, work in an upright position is best suited for periodic breaks in the ‚Äúseat‚Äù.  Transforming tables were developed specifically for this, where you can work both sitting and standing.  For such tables to bring even more benefits, you need to follow certain <a href="http://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-wellness/articles/2015/02/17/4-ways-your-standing-desk-is-doing-more-harm-than-good">rules</a> .  For example, constantly transfer body weight from one foot to another and change position as soon as you feel discomfort and desire to sit down. <br><br><h2>  Myth 4: Computer + treadmill = fitness at work </h2><br>  The possibility of combining sports and work looks very tempting.  There can be no harm, as from constant sitting or standing.  But the problem lies elsewhere: when you try to combine sport and work, you will most likely have to choose one or the other. <br><br>  The creator of such a "desktop" <a href="http://www.thesmarterhomeoffice.com/1720/the-treadmill-desk-4-best-tips-for-improved-health-and-productivity/">notes</a> that it is not suitable for all activities.  On the track, you can view mail, talk on the phone and even hold meetings.  And activities that require special concentration, such as writing code, still require a more standard body position. <br><br>  And to be at the table-track should be no more than half an hour in a row several times a day.  So it can also be considered as a supplement to the usual desktop.  By the way, this track <a href="https://plus.google.com/%2BSilviuStahie/posts/TLppGB3HUgZ">is</a> in the arsenal of Linux creator Linus Torvalds, who claims that he can work on it all day. <br><br>  But do not expect that with the help of this track you will be able to bring yourself into shape.  The only thing she can do is just not let you sit long.  For the same purposes, the workplace began to be <a href="http://inhabitat.com/top-6-products-for-staying-in-shape-at-work/">combined</a> with bicycles, exercise equipment, step platforms and even fitness bols that are used instead of a chair. <br><br><h2>  Myth 5: It is easier to think in a cool room. </h2><br>  Surprisingly, when working in a cold office, the <a href="http://ergo.human.cornell.edu/Conferences/EECE_IEQ%2520and%2520Productivity_ABBR.pdf">number of errors increases</a> .  Increasing the temperature by just 5 ¬∞ C (from 20 to 25) can reduce the number of errors by 44% and have a positive effect on productivity. <br><br>  However, do not place the workplace next to the battery, as a higher temperature also adversely affects the work.  We need a certain balance, which at home is easiest to find empirically.  And according to GOST, the ideal temperature for work <a href="http://www.internet-law.ru/gosts/gost/5265/">is</a> 22-25 ¬∞ C. <br><br>  In addition, the room should be ventilated every hour.  However, it is not written in any rules and regulations how to stop the eternal wars between those who are hot and those who are blowing. <br><br><h2>  Myth 6: For concentrated work, absolute silence is needed. </h2><br>  70 dB - the ideal level of noise that does not distract a person.  At 85 dB it becomes harder to work.  Headphones come to the rescue in a noisy office. <br><br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/blog/277676/">Properly selected music</a> can even increase productivity.  For example, classical or quiet music, atmospheric soundtracks from video games have a positive effect on concentration. <br><br><h2>  Myth 7: Partitions are required in open space </h2><br>  The issue with partitions between the tables is not so straightforward.  On the one hand, employees are beginning to feel more comfortable due to a more ‚Äúsecluded‚Äù atmosphere.  But when people do not see each other, they almost do not notice that they can distract someone with loud conversations.  A more effective solution to the problem is to <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3021206/dialed/how-to-create-an-open-office-that-is-more-awesome-for-both-introverts-and-extroverts">divide the</a> office into zones. <br><br>  It is impossible to simply put all the employees in a huge room and expect them to work efficiently.  Someone‚Äôs responsibilities include constant telephone conversations, and it is great to distract those who need to concentrate to perform completely different tasks.  Therefore, the separation of "interests" and the allocation of a quieter zone for the concentrated work of programmers, where, for example, it is better not to place a call center, will bear fruit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b95/df3/24c/b95df324c13a46eca61c5f8e7873ff67.jpg"><br>  <i>Photo Flickr / <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/pasa/8279389455/in/photolist-dBC334-qPmAmw-pzczfH-dQNsKM-92c7sz-FbjHA-3hMr4-cNqcG5-bavYia-9fay9A-H3Jzg-bkimAZ-mPJo8-5yBpyx-cFgvEj-9gZnop-x21BVY-okE2w6-onpVge-ngA8Q-FPJneL-krosni-6wHvD2-4qnB49-arDttT-8VEfFW-hAprfK-bVNm3B-4Dm2Gx-bVNvSD-disG3o-HCEp5-4kR7Gm-hAo59b-CGvXNt-5YbV2L-hAnRG6-bVNhVR-LLFBi-8uo1qr-9YVmrt-6KPUsL-g5Moj-dn6kJV-h5U73F-B4oHWc-cdaDA1-krqQDY-FB2MkP-kro62T">Paul Sableman</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC</a></i> <br><br><h2>  Myth 8: All norms and GOSTs have long been outdated. </h2><br>  GOST (without reference - you will not read anyway), defining the requirements for working with a computer, was introduced in 1996, but was reprinted in 2008. Like SANPIN, it includes many rules, for example, on the selection of a chair and table depending on height , on the position of the screen and keyboard, the level of illumination and some other aspects. <br><br>  All these figures were derived from careful calculations.  For example, a properly selected chair and table height avoids the difficulty of blood flow and the hands do not get tired so quickly.  Also, when properly seated, pressure on the knees, spine and neck is reduced. <br><br>  We have already cited the results of the <a href="http://ergo.human.cornell.edu/Conferences/EECE_IEQ%2520and%2520Productivity_ABBR.pdf">study of the</a> American scientist Alan Hedge, when we talked about the optimal temperature regime.  This study also reflects the results for perfect lighting, noise and vibration.  And they do not contradict the norms we have adopted. <br><br>  But the nuances associated with the position of the monitor can be questioned.  For example, it is assumed that the monitor should be below eye level and the angle of inclination of the line of observation should not exceed 60 degrees. <br><br>  Modern monitors with large diagonals most likely will not fit into such requirements, but the main thing is that a person sees the monitor entirely and does not have to raise or lower his head, therefore the larger the monitor, the farther it should be located from the eyes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/322028/">https://habr.com/ru/post/322028/</a></p>
