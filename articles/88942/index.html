  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About doubles, google, yandex, openstreet on the example of Kurgan and the Kurgan region (situation and forecasts)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At one time, I came across an interesting Habrovsk discussion in which, alas, I could not take part in the connection at that time with my non-presence at Habr√©.  The main theme of this ‚Äúmeasure‚Äù was the search for an answer to the question: ‚ÄúWhat is better: now and for the future?‚Äù ... Merili was mainly Google Maps, Yandex.Maps and DoubleGis - their maps and address directories.  On the general topic of discussion, which took place within the framework of the coverage of the territories of DublGis and the giants of the map service. <br><br>  Since I couldn‚Äôt get into the discussion, I wrote a little reflection on this topic using the example of the Kurgan Region and Kurgan.  Well, not much added to these comparisons service OpenStreetMap. <br><br>  <u>Actually the thought itself lies under the habrakat:</u> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>The situation is now:</b> <br>  DoubleGIS unconditional leader in the city of Kurgan.  Google and Yandex nervously smoke aside - they don‚Äôt have a map or satellite image, and therefore they don‚Äôt receive an audience in the city of Kurgan from their map services.  On the other hand, do they need this ‚Äúnot rich‚Äù audience?  OSM (OpenStreetMap), with its open use of data, is just starting to appear in Kurgan.  With a great desire, the city of Kurgan with the strength of 10-15 people of functionaries can be drawn in a month.  With reference books the situation is worse.  Although, as the examples of other actively developing offices in the near regions show, the directory can be increased to the level of the DoubleGis with small investments (telephone directories, several girls calling the organization).  The difficulty is mainly in updating the data and making a profit on advertising.

      In the region, the situation is simpler, neither 2Gis, nor Yandex, nor Google have maps of small cities and villages in the Kurgan region, but Shadrinsk, Ketovo, Dalmatovo, etc. begin to appear on OSM.  The arrival of DubliGis on these territories is not advisable due to the practical absence of advertisers, and the appearance of a map from Yandex and Google in the near future is also reduced to zero.  So, interest in open source projects will gradually grow. <br><br>  <b>Perspective (forecast):</b> <br>  <b>DoubleGIS</b> , as a working reference book of the manager will remain in operation, but it will definitely lose some of its positions.  The development in the region is zero.  The approach of competitors from Google and Yandex ezest part of the audience.  The development of OSM and other small competitive services also consumes a portion of the audience. <br>  It is possible that DoubleGis will need to look for a niche in creating a closed base of useful POIs, a departure from the monthly update of the database to the online update side.  Development of additional specialized layers and other unique data. <br><br>  <b>Yandex</b> , like a dark horse, and it‚Äôs not clear what to expect from him, but from the point of view of investments in the Kurgan region, he‚Äôs not twitching here with cartographic data of a serious reason, probably only on the residual principle and no more. <br><br>  <b>Google</b> , with its huge satellite imagery base and adjacent Mapmaker and Google Street projects (especially in the API format), can put a pig in the rest of the map services and reference books.  In general, as soon as Google opens the possibility of drawing maps on its satellite imagery in Russia and launches a marketing company to attract "draftsmen", and possibly material stimulation (they already hold contests like this), this will be a gradual approach to cartographic dominance. <br><br>  <b>OSM</b> - if they do not optimize the work with the POI, it can also turn sour, but interest in it will definitely intensify mainly from the villages and small cities, that is, where the card services do not reach. <br><br>  PS: POI is a "place of interest", that is, cafes, shops, offices, offices and so on.  what can be useful and interesting to the card user ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88942/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88942/</a></p>
