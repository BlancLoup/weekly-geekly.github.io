In this regard, I even allowed myself to sip a little bit of Chianti from old stocks.  In sad solitude, having noted this event (don't you think that I will be sharing Chianti with anyone?), I am full of energy to write another 975 reviews.  By the most conservative estimates, the 1000th blog review should appear in the winter of 2025.  A wonderful reason to live forever! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Strange, but the World Cup and does not think to end, but only gaining momentum!  I am also happy for the Ukrainians, but after the defeat of the Spaniards I had to reassure one lovely lady who was desperate for them.  But we are about blogs, right?  So, in my opinion, a wonderful commentator Vasily Utkin <a href="http://www.sports.ru/blog.html%3Fblogid%3D330">also maintains a blog</a> .  Naturally, about the world championship through the eyes of an eyewitness.  It is noteworthy that the records for the most part are precisely near football ones, which well conveys the atmosphere of the holiday that now reigns in Germany.  You read and drool over - yet, seeing everything alive is not on TV. <br><br>  It turns out that not only films about the relationship between the gorilla and the woman were many (this is me about King Kong), but also posters for them.  Foreigner Residential Galapagos was not lazy and <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/vintage_ads/155112.html">collected a large collection of</a> posters.  Presented posters from the 35th to the 59th years of the last century.  Pay attention not only to the evolution of images, but also to various film titles.

      Tell me, do you like the Minsk metro?  I find him sweet and very soulful.  Of course, compared to Moscow, it is very tiny, but this makes it even more comfortable.  But how do the Muscovites themselves see our subway?  visited us and <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_metro/1923980.html">shared his impressions</a> of the Minsk subway.  I myself found out some facts with great surprise.  Like the fact that we do not hang the metro schemes with reference to the map of the city, because the metro lines form something like a swastika.  Strange, but at my station it is just such a map that hangs, but I didn‚Äôt see the swastika there. <br><br>  The fact that in the United States itself is not so rosy with democracy, as they want to show, is understandable to everyone.  But so that in the American province there was such a <a href="http://increp.livejournal.com/222905.html">thing</a> , probably, none of you can even imagine.  I do not want to tell everything, it is better for you to follow the link and read.  The author called his article ‚ÄúAmerican Taliban.  Slavery of the 21st century. "  And this is only the beginning, the first part, then look for a sequel in the diary. <br><br>  What will happen if we combine several fairy tales into one?  If Buratino, Winnie the Pooh, Alice, the Hound of the Baskervilles will be in the same story and act together?  It will be very funny!  A passer-by was able to bring all these heroes together and forced him to participate in an unimaginable shed.  It is mandatory to read the story " <a href="http://zh-an.livejournal.com/335525.html">Crossroads</a> ". <br><br>  <a href="http://crazyhamster.livejournal.com/177020.html">In the last review</a> I mentioned a recording by Igor Karev, in which he talked about the hit parade of beauty contests.  Now one more note from Igor, this time the <a href="http://cheremis.livejournal.com/99951.html">top 10 unusual languages</a> .  These are not foreign languages, but those in our mouth.  According to Igor's classification, the language of a person took the second place prize, but for all the other winners we look at the link.  By the way, pay attention to the whole diary as a whole, because I want to bring to your attention one more hit parade from Igor.  This time, <a href="http://cheremis.livejournal.com/99261.html">the largest in the history of fraud</a> related to architectural landmarks.  It turns out, for example, the French police estimated that the Louvre was sold in whole and in parts, at least 18 times. <br><br>  The next article is called " <a href="http://aleksmot.livejournal.com/586710.html">Lifelight</a> ".  Best of all, the quote will say: "I <em>once again made sure today that the incredible twists and turns of events in the television series are not an invention of scriptwriters, but the reality of our life</em> ."  The story is really creepy and incredible, in my opinion, even in the TV shows you can hardly see it. <br><br>  A wonderful confession (or perhaps a written story) entitled "The <a href="http://homecat.livejournal.com/931614.html">monologue of a woman who considers herself to be ugly</a> ."  It seems that the text really suffered.  Again quote: " <em>At first I thought - well, nothing, this is teenage, I will ripen ... Then I looked at myself piece by piece and thought - well, but I have nothing here ... and my hair is excellent! And breasts - because breast is important - ogogo !!! Well, to hell with it, that the teeth are crooked and the nose is long, too, to me, the importance is great ...</em> ". <br><br>  Shpuller, in his diary, <a href="http://spuller.livejournal.com/738640.html">talks</a> about how, on June 2, 1967 in West Berlin, during the crackdown on a demonstration against the visit of the Iranian Shah, police officer Karlheinz Curras obviously did not accidentally shoot student Benno Onazorg.  The event is significant in that it has become a turning point in the minds of many future terrorists, and some participants in this story have become landmark political figures in German politics. <br><br>  The entire male population of the country is delighted with the service in the armed forces.  Naturally, they love to serve not only in our blue-eyed, but also in distant cold Israel.  Noperapon created a whole series of articles about the Israeli army, and I give you a link only to the <a href="http://noperapon.livejournal.com/11724.html">sixth series</a> , the rest is not difficult to find.  After reading, it seems that the Israeli army is the most frost-bitten in the world: ‚ÄúThe <em>instructors simply climb out of their skin so that none of the recruits can see them laughing, tired, sleepy or, for example, smoking. This will testify to their instructors ‚ÄúAnd a soldier, remember, must see in them a formidable, implacable and weaknessless supreme force</em> ." <br><br>  I think many have seen unusual images in which the laws of space are violated.  On the following <a href="http://prodigy-ru.livejournal.com/175175.html">link</a> you will see not only these images, but also their counterparts, made using the Lego constructor.  That someone tried. <br><br>  Well, the last number we have - <a href="http://kultru.livejournal.com/36654.html">cartoons made of sand</a> .  Perhaps, someone has already seen how Ilana Yahav, from ordinary sand and light, creates amazingly beautiful paintings.  If not, then you urgently need to see it! <br><br>  <b>A.A.</b>  <b>CHALETSKY</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2006260605.htm">Published in "Computer News" (‚Ññ26, 2006)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288058/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288058/</a></p>
