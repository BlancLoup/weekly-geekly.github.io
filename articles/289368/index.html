When everyone cringes at the mere mention of this word, they encounter danger with their breasts.  In any case, you will have to take a risk, but the risk is reasonable and deliberate - the ability to make such decisions is an integral part of the skill set of an outstanding entrepreneur.  More promising risks are associated with promising and controversial ideas that most smart people disagree with.  I took into account one of them, but there are others that can block my path.  We must try to understand how to make the chances of success as high as possible, that is, to minimize the risks, how to take a deliberate risk, and not to be given to chance.  This is the best picture that we found, and it combines all of the above.

Investment declaration is a list of provisions.  For example, with LinkedIn, everyone, including companies, will benefit from being in a community of professionals.  The first will be people who have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow such a community should look like, they will get used to it, and then there will be a mass market offering lucrative deals.  This is what an investment declaration might look like.  This is followed by the economy, hiring employees and the expansion of the company. <br><br>  Do you have an investment declaration, do you think it strengthens faith in the idea or vice versa?  Did the information coming from the market shake my confidence?  Risks can be reduced, I will give you an example of how.  In the early days of PayPal, the idea was to pay bills with Palm Pilots, because it is really easy, but we realized that such a system would not work even before the product was launched.  But it turned out that I came to Max and Peter and told me what tests await us ... <br><br>  Oh, this group doesn‚Äôt seem to know what Palm Pilots are.  Palm Pilots - this is the first handheld computers (PDA).  We lived where such gadgets were widespread, so we assumed that with a PDA you could even pay for lunch - it would be enough just to be able to split the bill between diners, but how many people at the table will actually have Palm Pilots?  From zero to one, in every restaurant.  Just thinking about what you can expect, if you continue to move in the same direction, you can manage to turn to the side and not enter the minefield.  At this point, Max Legend (Max Legend) came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãworking by email.  We decided that making payments by e-mail was a good idea, and turned around in this direction.  When launching products, always think about how to minimize risks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8aa/f83/684/8aaf8368437749dc942269a013a2a08b.png" width="500"><br><br>  Another urgent question arises: what problems to solve?  Resolve issues that can affect the project in the long term, or focus on solving directly emerging problems? <br><br>  And again, the answer will be: do both that and that, only this time you also need to switch between them.  You should always keep your vision in your head, because if you lose your direction, you risk being in a situation from which there will be no acceptable way out.  At the same time, if you do not focus on solving the problems that are directly facing you, you can dig a hole for yourself. <br><br>  You ask me how to combine everything?  You need to ask yourself the questions: ‚ÄúWhat should I do today?  Have I moved forward today?  Did I move forward in a week?  Is there much more to come? ‚ÄùI will give you an example of how this works in finance and strategy.  People often believe that the key to the success of a project is a strategy based on the production of a product: ‚ÄúI have an idea!  She is a good, perhaps, we will create a company. ‚Äù  But following the strategy is the release of the product, and in any sphere, consumer and corporate - any.  At this stage, it doesn‚Äôt matter how good your product is, if you don‚Äôt get your users, you can start hammering nails into the coffin lid. <br><br>  Distribution of the product is much more important than the product itself, and, as a rule, this is a priority task.  Funding is even lower level - if you run out of money, all efforts will be in vain, despite the fact that the idea was good.  When you create a startup with a good strategy, then, taking funds in one place, you should think about who can give the next batch of money.  For this, I make plans and establish relationships with people who can assist the project.  I do not start a business in order to live only until the next stage of financing - this is a project that needs to be built.  I‚Äôm not the first day working with startups, and I‚Äôll tell you that the work strategy is to take care of product distribution, provided that the funding comes in the right amount. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/79b/efc/8a4/79befc8a4ea541cea4343f4ba3c67e42.png" width="500"><br><br>  Well, do you think you can become outstanding leaders?  To become a successful person, you definitely need to have super powers.  It is useful to have leadership skills, to be able to create communities, to persuade people, and most importantly, it is useful to understand when you are moving in the right direction, and when you turned the wrong way.  You need to believe in your investment declaration and not deviate from its provisions - doing everything correctly, you learn, unite people, gather them around you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c21/390/96f/c2139096fb5540d583f27c990f8726f6.png" width="500"><br><br>  By tradition, I will show you five photos of white men who are great entrepreneurs [Slide].  But founders can be very different people and have talents in other areas of activity.  Being the founders of completely different companies, they face and solve various types of problems.  I do not mean racial differences, gender or any other, I mean differences in age and experience.  Jack Ma (Jack Ma) was a teacher before you start doing what he does.  This is an occasion for you to think. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/34a/88a/97f/34a88a97f40447169ce0047068392ac3.png" width="500"><br><br>  The question is how to overcome all difficulties?  How to gather people around you?  How to convince them to unite? <br><br>  Answers to these questions entirely depend on the situation.  I tried to convey to you that there is no specific set of skills, there is only the ability to learn and adapt, to follow your vision, but to take into account information from all available sources in order to form communities around you.  That's what makes you outstanding entrepreneurs. <br><br>  The path of the entrepreneur lies in the fog on the ground with holes and cracks, and the ability to follow this path is decisive.  What a turn will take things, only the madman knows.  Though crazy ideas sometimes work.  On this note, I would like to end the talk and answer your questions.  I described the key points of the thinking of the leaders, and if there are no questions, then ... oh, please ask. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">I wonder how you chose your direction?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  First you need to think about the distribution of the product.  In the case of LinkedIn, several factors worked for us.  First, the Internet was boring in 2003, everyone decided that b2c-internet was dead, so people left in the direction of corporate software and similar things.  Today, this has resulted in a problem, since now everyone believes that the Internet and mobile devices are interesting. <br><br>  It is very important to be able to filter the extra information.  Our strategy did not work, so we sent several invitations to groups of people and debugged the mechanism, conducted a PR campaign.  One of the decisions we made at an early stage was the choice between registration by invitation and free authorization. <br><br>  We settled on the latter, because people with whom we did not even know, showed enthusiasm and said that they were ready to register and attract more people.  Now we have to make much more difficult decisions. <br><br>  You have to take care of the distribution of the product when you need to fight for customers and their attention.  What do they believe in?  In 2003, a good idea could be launched, and people said, ‚ÄúWhat the hell?  I can hang out here, because [on the Internet] there are not so many things worth seeing. ‚Äù  Today, the products are just tons, so when you are distributing, you need to decide, ‚ÄúWhat defines my product?  What do I know such a cunning thing that others do not know? ‚Äù </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How do you know who is worth investing in, and who is not?</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> I am an ardent supporter of connections.  I will set up a meeting for someone only if they recommend it to me.  And by the way, I need to leave soon - I have an appointment.  If you want me to give you time, you need to enlist the support of someone I know.  I'm not trying to advertise LinkedIn, I just distribute my time. <br><br>  Sam knows me and can vouch for someone.  For example, when I met the guys from AirBnB, I could interrupt their performance after 2 minutes and say: ‚ÄúI want to invest in your project, and now I want to hear the continuation of your performance, because I consider what you are doing, magical and cool. " <br><br>  I could do that because I was recommended to them.  Before coming to their presentation, I already knew about their project, so the whole process took only 2 minutes, instead of 30. This practice applies to large investors.  Therefore, communities are important. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Do you think that insight is destined to become a defining skill?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  I can say with certainty that the ability to clearly express your thoughts should be your main goal.  There is no need to fill the speech with idle talk or stories about the best approaches, give priority to yourself, your product and the principles of its work. <br><br>  This is an important point of evaluation of the company founder.  If you fail to deliver your speech, you will not be able to gather people around you, you will not be able to attract employees and investors - you need to be able to formulate a clear mission.  I can not agree that insight helps at some stages of development. <br><br>  I like people who are able to correctly analyze the problem, but also I meet excellent entrepreneurs who do not carry out a thorough analysis, but act by instinct.  So it's pretty hard to judge. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">When you create a company, how to keep your course unchanged?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  LinkedIn went through a lot, you can remember that we were considered a modest alternative to Friendster, then MySpace, and then Facebook.  We survived a lot - we were crumbs compared to giants.  I think in LinkedIn, in the end, it all came down to the adoption of an investment declaration as a mechanism. <br><br>  I continued to believe that the economic system should have an open profile, and was created for each company and each person individually.  This was how the world should have looked, but it was not bad living for everyone.  We approached the image of such a world as the closest, but the service gained popularity not as fast as I wanted. <br><br>  The social part of this story is very interesting.  We were able to get into the news only in the summer of 2003: we were referred to as Friendster, only for business, because if you take a closer look, then this is completely absurd.  It seems they have pity on us, they say, so be it, we will write about you.  But it was important that society paid attention to us, we became confident that the world that LinkedIn needed exists, and we came closest to it.  This path took us more time than I expected, but this is normal. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Why do you think wrong to be distracted from the main idea?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  To some extent, you can cross a minefield only after passing through it.  It may become clear that your hypotheses are not true.  During discussions, I often try to push through an idea in which I seek both flexibility and perseverance.  If I have my own opinion, then I try to persuade others to my side, but I also listen to other suggestions. <br><br>  Sometimes you meet someone who has learned to imitate this behavior, and with his appearance he says: "I can now look as if I am discussing things with you, thinking about the tasks that you have set, but in fact I ignore you."  Ignoring me may be fine, but I would not recommend ignoring the world around me. <br><br>  The most frequently asked questions about entrepreneurship relate to the topic of adaptability, they often mention the phrase - an endless learning curve.  Often these things are completely misunderstood.  Every entrepreneurial pattern is to some extent new and unique.  Can you learn a new one?  Can I learn this or need a new skill set?  Could ego hinder this?  If you want people to be flattered, this will make it difficult to adjust to the problem, which is the wrong behavior.  I think I have time for another question. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">What makes a team outstanding, and is there a good way to evaluate it?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  First, it is very important to learn how to interact with each other.  I set this task for my team.  In addition, you need to trust each other.  A start-up team must have diverse, but necessary qualities, often someone works in the technical field, and someone is engaged in fundraising. <br><br>  Team members must have a combination of any skills from the standard set that I gave you at the beginning of the lecture.  Think about how the co-founders will work in a team?  You can quite often hear that investors are advised not to bet on a team consisting of a husband and wife - this aspect complicates the task and additional changing factors appear. <br><br>  Personally, I think you just need to see how they interact.  Helping each other to get to the truth?  For example, when I speak with a team, I mostly speak.  I wait until they begin to discuss something among themselves, and not just to agree with each other.  Have you thought about it?  Or what about this task? <br><br>  You are on the battlefield with many dangers.  For example, it was normal for PayPal when Max, who invented production systems and everything else, came to the office of Peter (Pether Thiel) and turned our attention to things that could destroy the company.  We did not sing shaman songs, but accepted the truth and solved problems.  We discussed which ones need to be addressed immediately, and which ones will affect us only after some time?  How do we solve them?  Collaborative problem solving and collaborative learning are what help create great teams. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Different founders, different areas, how to classify them?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  I said that managers of different start-ups have different thinking.  There are great startups everywhere, and they all differ from each other.  For example, in software, speed of entry to the market and speed of learning are important.  In the field of hardware accuracy is very important, because if you have developed and sold the wrong product, you are finished. <br><br>  For these reasons, investors are closely studying the scope of their interests in order to be able to determine which startups in this area make sense, and if you invest in it, then how can you get the maximum benefit?  I mean that each area has certain characteristics. <br><br>  Here is a classic example: how well do you have to understand operational efficiency in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãprofit, price management and other things?  If you are busy in the world of commerce, you should understand this well, and if you play games like Zing, then this is not important at all.  Are you looking for where your skills could be useful because you can not do everything. <br><br>  One of the funniest conversations happened to a friend of mine who worked with me in my first startup, Social Net, he looked at me and said, ‚ÄúRaid, I would never hire you as a McDonald‚Äôs manager,‚Äù to which I replied, ‚ÄúI would not have hired himself. "  I would have failed.  It is necessary to have not only suitable skills, but also to understand things that at first glance look paradoxical, alternately switching from one task to another.  The universal solution is the ability to correctly judge what you are doing at the moment. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to find out when it's time to change direction?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  One of the reasons to have an investment declaration is the opportunity to be confident in the direction of travel.  If your confidence in the project has not changed for a long time or weakens, because over a long period it should weaken, then you need to begin to act. <br><br>  Trying to understand what measures can be taken to strengthen the faith, and if this is not done, it means that at this moment you need to seriously think about changing direction.  Your investment position can be aimed at making a profit, distributing a product, growing and viral advertising. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe tried these three things, and the fourth does not look as good as the others.  The next two look even worse, ‚Äùat this moment your confidence begins to fluctuate and here you can think about a change of direction.  A common mistake: when it comes time to turn, you wait until you hit the wall and die.  They waited for more turn will not work. <br><br>  Now about personal and career goals and all that.  I wanted to talk about this with you even during the slideshow - about the classic question about balance.  In fact, I believe that company executives do not have a balance [between work and personal life]. <br><br>  One of the funniest conversations I had was with the governor of the state of Colorado, he believed that we could attract many entrepreneurs because of the attractiveness of our balanced lifestyle.  If I hear that the startup speaks about what a balanced lifestyle he leads, I would never believe in his success.  The most prominent founders are those who are able to give all their strength to work.  Maybe I will be engaged in business only a couple of years, and while I do this, I will not have a balance.  You need to do your job very hard, because there are many ways leading to failure. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How good are startups in identifying mutually exclusive opportunities?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Let's get a look.  This is a rather complicated question.  What comes into fashion is no longer an innovation.  I would say that there is confusion.  An exceptional investor is distinguished by the ability to search for radical projects - the ability to find that one among the extraneous noise of a huge community, in which absolutely abnormal ideas sometimes occur. <br><br>  The funny thing is, the benchmark was the only one who sponsored eBay.  If you could talk to people in the Valley 18 months ago about Bitcoin, they would ask: ‚ÄúWhat?  Bit-what? ‚Äù- they had no idea about what it is.  However, the fate of Bitcoin is still unclear.  Almost certainly in the world there will be a distributed credit system based on cryptocurrency, the question is whether Bitcoin will be the first or last cryptocurrency?  The first, because it has some new features, the last, because the system has network effects and is already functioning. <br><br>  I believe that the startup system does a pretty good job with isolating non-standard projects.  It often happens that people begin to consider themselves creative and extraordinary thinking, because they have come up with some unusual combination.  I will give you two examples, I hope that the current company leaders sent me this slope.  Usually I don‚Äôt look at the pictures that are sent to me, and they are sent to 30 per day, but I‚Äôm paying attention if the headline made me laugh, in which case I regard it as a joke.  And I want to share with you these two. <br><br>  One project was diapers, which had a built-in computer that monitors whether the child went to the toilet if you are not around.  And if you are not around, then this is a bad sign.  There was also the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating custom bongs and selling them through an electronic store.  When such people say: "Hey, I have an original idea!", I think: "Yes, it is, but you are going in the wrong direction."  Generally speaking, the system does a pretty good job with this task. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">What do you think is better to create markets or search for them?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  This is a difficult question and a great addition to the question of originality.  Standard question: ‚ÄúIs there a market?  Will it be huge or insignificant? ‚ÄùThe good news is that this is usually one or the other.  Creating a market is a good tactic, but only if you have reason to believe that such a market can be built. <br><br>  Checking your investment declaration, ask yourself the question: ‚ÄúWhat gives me reason to think so?‚Äù At first there is no market, but you can create it if society decides that it needs your product.  On the other hand, there is a problem, how to get people there quickly if they have no idea that they need your product? <br><br>  The classic mistake of entrepreneurs is the idea that it is enough to tell about the emerging market, and customers rush to it to line up.  Several entrepreneurs can do this, Steve Jobs was among them.  In most cases, this does not happen, so you should indicate in your investment declaration that others do not know. <br><br>  What do you think about this non-existent market, why can it exist?  Such a small moment was in the history of LinkedIn.  Previously, ads were submitted to newspapers, and in our digital age, with the availability of the Internet, appeals are made directly to people, just as they should be.  Here is an example when you can assume that there is a potentially new market that is relatively easy to identify. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to determine that you trust a person enough to become co-founders?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Here you need to take into account a huge number of variables.  This is one of the risks you take.  Ask yourself: "Do I know this person well enough?" <br><br>  I will draw parallels that I believe will be useful.  When the management of the company wants to hire a new director, I tell them that the only way to do this is to condescend to people who can take an office chair and spend more than 20 hours with them.  During this time, a conversation is held, during which you delve as deeply as possible into all the topics that you think may cause disagreement: about opinions, beliefs, style of work. <br><br>  Need to figure this out in advance.  This is not the signing of a contract, as we usually do, but a conversation, during which we go through all the points at which disagreements may or may not arise.  One of the things worth discussing is a breakup.  What makes me say that we will not work together? <br><br>  We need to discuss this in advance, because when you enter the battlefield, everyone is under the influence of tremendous stress.  You wander in the valley of the shadows, but rely on joint plans and common expectations, and if something starts to change, it is relatively easy to come to an agreement to solve the problem.  You must be sure that you trust each other.  For me, this means holding a series of sensible conversations.  When someone comes new, we discuss possible changes and can easily accept them. </div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289368/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289368/</a></p>
