      I once looked into an acquaintance, keen on home brewing.  I do not remember what he was cooking then, but operations with three pans, transfusions of liquids, temperature measurement and enchanting smells flying around, sunk into my head.  The process itself really did ask for automation - sequential heating of the wort, pumping liquids, the ability to come up with all sorts of sensors to measure the parameters we need ... <br>  In general, as a result of cooking, in addition to the final product, we decided to make a home automated brewery for training, demonstration of processes and, of course, getting beer. <br><br>  In principle, in the world there are two main types of automated home breweries - three-boiler HERMS (Heat Exchange Recirculating Mash System) and two-boiler RIMS (Recirculating Infusion Mash Systems).  We decided to make HERMS.  They took the following scheme as a basis: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a50/eb1/d3e/a50eb1d3eb5441b99b69850fd1c22cf4.png"><br><br>  We used here 12 ball valves (some had to be changed, as brass at temperatures close to 100 remarkably wedge), two pumps (H1, H2), a pair of tenes (T1, T2) of 3.5 Kw and copper tubes on crimps, which we damned after a couple of reassembly system and replaced with transparent hoses. <br><br>  The theme of the ‚Äúiron‚Äù part of the brewery training center is a bit of a pain.  One has only to recall the moment of realization of hopelessness when you drill a hole under the Chinese cone drill into the hole in a non-Chinese stainless steel tank, or when you start the pumps after assembly, and you are beating fountains from all the connections on the extension cord, but sealing the connections! <br><br>  In general, after a week of savagery with a drill, dremel and files, we got a device like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a04/3e1/9c6/a043e19c6dc24321ab70df6bd7180685.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Beer technology </h4><br>  The most interesting thing about this story is the topic of technology.  So we'll talk about it further, and I will describe the technical details along the way. <br><br>  For a start, let's get acquainted with the process being automated.  Brewing itself is quite simple and well automated.  By operating with three raw materials - hops, malt and water, as well as the temperature and movement of our product between tanks, you can get almost everything for a frothy drink.  For making recipes there are good ready-made applications, for example, BeerSmith and BeerTools, which calculate even the color of the final drink by the raw materials used, they also indicate all the important intermediate values ‚Äã‚Äãduring the cooking stages so that the process can be adjusted. <br>  At the same time, with the simplicity of the main technical process in production, there is a huge amount of nuances, chips and intuitions, which provide tremendous opportunities for creativity and endless ‚Äúimprovement‚Äù. <br><br>  Since the artist from me is not very, for the description of the technical process the wife was involved: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3a7/84a/83f/3a784a83f1ef44938918c4a0800e4ade.png"><br><br>  <b>In the first stage, we prepare malt and water</b> .  The malts used must be crushed, so that they give away the starches and enzymes well in our final wort, while at the same time so that they do not give a lot of dust, which will then be difficult to filter out.  Water also needs to be prepared, as any impurities during heat treatment will affect the final taste and <a href="http://gramota.ru/forum/veche/71816/">drinkability of</a> beer.  Here you can get stuck and get a "profile" of water - the salt composition, but in order not to bother - reverse osmosis at the inlet solves the problem.  Water enters a separate vat, heats up to the desired temperature and is added to the ‚Äúmash‚Äù. <br><br>  When our ‚Äúmash‚Äù is ready, we <b>start the process of kneading the malt</b> .  In this process, our "mash" heats up stepwise to several temperatures and is kept for some time.  At each temperature pause, various enzymes from our malt begin to act, which break down starches and proteins.  Due to this, we get the organoleptic properties of beer that we need - color, density, strength.  In general, there is something to play with in the recipe. <br><br>  <b>At this stage there are several ways to automate the process</b> .  You can heat the mash directly: you need to heat the outside with a tile so as not to get roasted malt.  For the most frequent home brewery schemes (HERMS and RIMS), the wort is pumped through a filter at the bottom of the tank and heated through a heat exchanger with either hot water from another tank or pumped through a flow heater. <br><br>  The picture shows the heat exchanger in the left tank.  And in the right ‚Äúwatering can‚Äù, through which the future wort is drained back into the mash. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/097/52f/820/09752f820ee34d2dac4e00046b3b69f2.jpg"><br><br>  Another method of heating is ‚ÄúInfusion‚Äù, when we add heated water from other tanks, calculating the difference between volumes and temperatures in order to get the final result.  It is convenient to use in simple home brewing, without automation. <br>  After we <b>produce ‚ÄúMash-out‚Äù</b> - we raise the temperature to 77 so that the enzymes stop working.  Here you can hold the primary hopping, if you need a prescription, but the main thing now is to clear our wort from the "grains" - that did not dissolve at the entrance. <br><br>  To do this, we <b>start the process of transferring the wort to the third tank</b> - the brewer, and in order to wash the remaining sugars from the remains of the grains, and also to prevent the pellet from oxidizing in the air, we pour hot water from the heated wash tank. <br><br>  As a result, we get a clean wort in a wort kettle, where we add hops and start the process of boiling the wort.  <b>At this stage, we must obtain the wort of the density and saccharification necessary for us</b> .  If with a density of a little bit progadali, at this stage, you can either add wash water, or vice versa, evaporate the excess to the level we need. <br><br>  <b>After boiling, we have an almost ready wort</b> , we need density, hopped, rich in sugars, and with a good temperature - a paradise for any foreign bacterial living creatures.  Therefore, in order not to allow uninvited competitors to our right yeast, we must quickly lower the temperature of our wort, besides, we need to maximally clean the wort from any small suspension that is still present in it. <br><br>  You can use sophisticated filters to remove the slurry, but in the household you can use the laws of physics and just make a "whirlpool" - a L-shaped tube is made in the wort tank, which sets the direction of the flow of the wort.  We begin to pump out the wort from the bottom of the tank, and under the pressure we drive it in a circle through the cooling chiller and our tube.  We get a whirlpool, where all small particles remain in the center of the tank. <br><br>  We decided to add beauty and visualization to the process, so the Win 10 Core was delivered to the Raspbery PI and the WPF application was written, which, when connected to HDMI, drew the whole technical process: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/020/881/137/020881137c2c42888d0729d1d0ca5cc7.png"><br><br>  The final scheme is slightly different from the original, but this is engineering!  The application allows you to manually control the valves, pumps and pumps, as well as manually and automatically run all process cycles according to recipes.  And of course, they connected everything to the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/ru-ru/services/iot-hub/">IoT Hub in</a> order to collect temperature and time statistics of the system. <br><br><h3>  about the author </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b62/088/9b9/b620889b9ea24b32bfc7b7df4694e3d1.jpg" align="left" width="120"><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/sveer/">Alexey Lyubko</a> - more than 15 years engaged in the development of applied information systems based on Microsoft technologies for government agencies and commercial organizations.

For 9 years, the owner of the status of Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (Microsoft MVP). <br><hr><br><br><h2>  10 facts about beer </h2><br>  During the preparation of the article, we with <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/ahriman/" class="user_link">ahriman</a> (Sasha Belotserkovsky) read various stories, and found some interesting facts that we decided not to put in the table and share with you. <br><br>  <b>Fact 1</b> .  There is an opinion that the cultivation of grain crops began not to feed the people with bread, but to drink beer.  It certainly looks radical, but it has a place to be.  In 2013, <a href="http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html%3Fid%3D1171216%26cid%3D2161">Vesti wrote</a> about this: It turns out that the driving force behind the development of human civilization was a passion for alcoholic beverages. <br><br>  <b>Fact 2</b> .  <a href="http://www.nkj.ru/archive/articles/3954/">It is believed</a> that beer is almost as many millennia as our civilization.  The most ancient "traces" of beer were found in western Iran and date back to 3500-3000 years BC.  e. <br><br>  <b>Fact 3</b> .  The University of Copenhagen <a href="https://travel.rambler.ru/article/116/">conducted a study</a> in which they found that strong dark varieties should be drunk with high-pitched music, and light light ones - with low-tone melodies.  This affects the process of assimilation of the drink.  So it is worth considering what to listen to during beer get-togethers. <br><br>  <b>Fact 4</b> .  There is a <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf034737u">study</a> that proves that beer fights cancer.  According to him, hops - the best source of antioxidants than, for example, wine. <br><br>  <b>Fact 5</b> .  In Houston, there is a <a href="http://www.beercanhouse.org/">house completely decorated with beer cans</a> .  In 1968, John Milkovich invented and decorated it for 18 years. <br><br>  <b>Fact 6</b> .  In 1814 in London there was a real <a href="http://www.furfur.me/furfur/culture/culture/177321-skaz-o-tom-kak-pivom-london-zatopilo">beer flood</a> , which eventually led to several casualties.  According to the descriptions it was an eerie sight. <br><br>  <b>Fact 7</b> .  The pleasant fruity taste of lambic is achieved by the fact that they are drawn in wine barrels. <br><br>  <b>Fact 8</b> .  Have you ever thought that you can brew beer using microservices?  The author of this <a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/brewery">repository</a> thought about this and offered his own version. <br><br>  <b>Fact 9</b> .  In the US, there is a craft brewery that <a href="http://www.computerdealernews.com/news/hololens-to-brew-better-beer/55353">uses HoloLens</a> to determine the quality of its beer. <br><br>  <b>Fact 10</b> .  In the UK, you can drink beer that is brewed <a href="http://metro.co.uk/2017/05/10/booze-2-0-you-can-now-drink-beer-brewed-by-an-artificial-intelligence-6628328/">using artificial intelligence technologies</a> . <br><br>  We also found a step-by-step <a href="http://gunnarpeipman.com/presentations/brewing-eisbock-with-raspberry-pi-and-windows-10-iot/">tutorial</a> from our MVP on how to brew with Raspberry PI and Windows 10 IoT.  Therefore, we have a question. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/334902/">https://habr.com/ru/post/334902/</a></p>
