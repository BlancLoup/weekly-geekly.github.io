  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Forecasts for the development of the Internet advertising market for 2009</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>I. Introduction</b> <br>  How quickly and rapidly flew past year, leaving behind a truly unimaginable in size information plume, which we have yet to analyze and disassemble by bit, to understand in which direction the vector of development of the Internet advertising market has shifted.  And, as we know, from the course of geometry - the direction of any vector can be determined if we know the coordinates of its beginning and end.  So let's try to determine the very starting point from which we enter the year 2009, and try to predict where our locomotive called ‚ÄúInternet Marketing 2009‚Äù has moved. <br><br>  <b>Ii.</b>  <b>Carefully, the doors are closing, the next stop is the city of Anadyr.</b> <br>  One of the innovative trends of 2008 was the message of Yandex about the beginning of the railway communication (in the virtual space) between the cities of Magadan and Anadyr.  In addition, now everyone can get information about when and where the next stop is planned.  In this case, according to the company Yandex, the railway will continue to grow.  The plans for 2009 are to build flights with at least another two or three Russian cities.  Well, Yandex has earned at least a stormy applause from the ‚Äúassociation of search shamans and sorcerers‚Äù (hereinafter ASC) for such an unexpected move. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <b>Iii.</b>  <b>SE-oriented software and automation boom.</b> <br>  Truly, 2008 will be remembered by the appearance of countless SE services.  The industry of SE-software is experiencing an unprecedented rise.  It was provoked by such rapid growth in the first place the automation of production in the SEM &amp; SEO market.  Many companies invest a lot of money in the production of their own innovative programs, investing in the development of promising SE-software, and the purchase is already ready for development.  For example, according to analysts of our company, in 2007-2008, the complex automation of the entire production, made it possible to reduce (within our company): <br>  - the cost of preparing the strategy of each advertising campaign from 8 to 2.5 hours; <br>  - weekly monitoring of the quality of the reference base for the project (differential calculation based on averaged data) from 1 hour to 5 minutes; <br>  - preparation of reporting and analytics on the project from 2 hours to 8-10 minutes; <br>  - conducting a comprehensive audit of the current state of the market sectors (differential) from 4 hours to 20 minutes; <br>  - preparation of an individual KP from 2-3 hours to 15-20 minutes; <br>  This, and many others, allowed freeing up to 40% of the time of a regular SEO-optimizer and, immediately, it became possible to concentrate on more technological areas that already require mental expenditures and deep knowledge in our manufacturing sector.  According to our forecasts, in 2009-2010, the understanding of the role of the SEO optimizer within each project will be rethought and reduced only to planning and controlling the progress of the advertising campaign, while all the main (routine) processes will be delivered in whole or in part (up to 80 90%) on the conveyor. <br>  At the same time, we should not forget that our Internet advertising market is very rigidly tied to the development of the market for search technologies and any innovative leap ‚Äúthere‚Äù, echoing and with us ‚Äúhere‚Äù.  However, we don‚Äôt have to wait in 2009-2010 for the appearance of something that can completely change the current picture, since any serious changes to the algorithms are planned and implemented for a very, very long time.  Recall, at least, the Google Rugged TrustRunk of 2005, which we learned about patenting back in 2003, and even then we began to prepare for the new conditions of the game. <br>  Returning to the topic of forecasts, we confidently look into 2009, and have no doubt in the growing role of the increasingly wider automation of technological processes and production.  In a crisis, there will be stronger people on their feet who will have time for self-development and the introduction of more intelligent technologies to <a href="http://www.webintop.ru/">promote</a> customer <a href="http://www.webintop.ru/">sites</a> , and for this you first need to free yourself from the shackles of routine. <br>  <a href="http://www.webintop.ru/%3Fact%3Darticles%26id%3D5">Read more "</a> <br><habracut></habracut></div>
