  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Highscreen Alpha Rage - budget for budget</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Frankly, I'm not a fan of cheap smartphones.  I prefer to pay dearly for ‚Äúmegahertz and megabytes‚Äù, which at least in a year will still be relevant.  However, the market is growing mainly due to budget devices, which no, no, yes, and are in the focus of my attention.  For example, I really want to try in the case of Xiaomi Red Rice and Motorola Moto G. However, for now this is just a wish and, a little, a dream.  But the reality has thrown into my hands a completely different budget - Highscreen Alpha Rage.  Without being imbued with his appearance at first, I went to the Internet to evaluate what was happening.  It turned out that this smartphone, in general, is not so bad, and at the price of 4,990 rubles there are few real alternatives to it (of course, in official retail). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ef/916/56f/7ef91656fcd17e8eea4696d413749d0f.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Before going directly to the text, I would like to outline an audience that can live with Highscreen Alpha Rage.  In my opinion, there are schoolchildren and students on one side of the barricades, doctors and teachers on the other.  In short, those who are accustomed to increased responsibility to treat large expenses.  If only because it receives (earns) not the largest amounts.  Hence the meaning of the name of the review.

    <h4>  Unintelligible appearance </h4><br>  It is very difficult to make a frankly inexpensive smartphone attractive from the outside, but it can be seen in Highscreen and did not try.  Rounded corners, beveled side faces, pseudo metal edging around the perimeter - all this has already been seen a thousand times on other companies' smartphones.  Especially Samsung. <br>  The screen is covered with glass, pretty brand.  The back panel is a cross between ordinary plastic and soft-touch.  I don‚Äôt really like the fact that there is a tide in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe camera lens - the eye-framed frame painted under metal will quickly peel off. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/243/103/97e/24310397ed1ec3643ac55a12f7b19d7f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/45b/270/795/45b27079537e922897f828cfc005be4d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/68c/4fe/e8b/68c4fee8bc22b414fed4c476bf1407a1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ba/122/687/4ba122687c879294ba58038d17071a4c.jpg"><br><br>  Under the hood we observe the original installation system of SIM-cards - one above the other in two floors.  Well, at least a slot for a microSD card is easily accessible.  The battery is removable, with a capacity of 2,000 mAh.  The battery life with active use of the smartphone - a day, with moderate use - two. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/37c/431/25b/37c43125bee14450e0a62cc2be299a7d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f4a/de8/d8e/f4ade8d8e5a08c0fd76db1f838e4cac0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/681/7e8/06b/6817e806bb475ce3f8275c0154d1a022.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b8f/493/a0a/b8f493a0a5c8d543d764d5470b1d2df4.jpg"><br><br>  I didn‚Äôt notice serious ergonomic errors in Highscreen Alpha Rage, because of the relatively small diagonal screen, the device holds in the hand well, the buttons are pressed normally.  There are only two of the last ones: on the left side there is a volume control swing, on the right side there is an on / off key.  Headphone and USB cable connectors on the upper edge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2a4/d13/f4e/2a4d13f4e48a7183686ececa19e7053d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/344/eac/5f1/344eac5f1410b09a802771f6b8630de1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/723/0a5/59f/7230a559f0fde4c116cb90211627802f.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Kit as a kit </h4><br>  In the original box, the appearance of which remotely resembles the boxes of Xiaomi smartphones, there was a battery, a USB cable with a charger, a warranty card with instructions and a poor quality wired headset. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d12/f7a/7e3/d12f7a7e3c5bced74d5535d15aa75643.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/628/083/c21/628083c21e142b91137dd1c6728615c2.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Large display </h4><br>  A display for a smartphone for 4,990 rubles - a large, 4.5 inches.  As mentioned above, the screen is branded, and due to the use of the TN matrix, the viewing angles are very small.  However, if you do not plan to often look at the display with someone for a couple - it will come down.  Resolution non-standard, 854 x 480 pixels.  I feared for compatibility with games and programs, but the alarms were in vain.  The cache, which I use with other MTK-based smartphones and tablets, was not capricious with Highscreen Alpha Rage.  The stock of brightness is moderate, on a street on a clear day, you have to twist it to the maximum.  That, in principle, and better IPS-matrices are often characteristic. <br><br><h4>  All the beauty inside </h4><br>  Highscreen Alpha Rage is built on the MediaTek MT6589M platform, which opens the MT6589 series.  It includes a 1.2-GHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 processor and a PowerVR SGX544 GPU.  In the light of the recently announced eight-platform MT6592 platform, of course, there is nothing remarkable here, but for an inexpensive smartphone, the presence of the MT6589M is a bold plus, because it provides decent performance, as will be discussed below.  I note that HTC, LG or Samsung, even the more expensive ones, offer users very very dull single-dual platforms like Qualcomm MSM7227A (HTC 200, LG Optimus L5) or STE Novathor U8500 (Samsung Galaxy Ace 2). <br><br>  The smartphone supports GSM (850/1900 MHz) and UMTS (2100 MHz) networks.  It provides Wi-Fi 802.11b / g / n and Bluetooth 4.0 adapters, as well as a GPS receiver. <br><br>  The amount of RAM went under the knife for the sake of cheaper smartphone - in the presence of only 512 MB.  But the amount of flash memory - the standard 4 GB, of which the user can access something about 2.6 GB.  Due to the presence of a microSD slot, which I already wrote about, a small amount of flash memory is not a problem.  Actually, with 512 MB of RAM, too, can be tolerated.  The main thing is not to download multiple games at once and control the memory load by other applications. <br><br>  What do schoolchildren need from a smartphone?  To "games and without lags."  And here I dare to note that the game Highscreen Alpha Rage pulls.  And not the usual 2D like Angry Bird, Hill Climb Racing or Plants vs.  Zombies, but also quite three-dimensional ones like Asphalt 8 or Modern Combat 4. <br>  Benchmarks favor the low resolution of the screen and a fairly powerful GPU (despite the fact that it operates at a frequency of only 156 MHz).  AnTuTu estimated the capabilities of the Highscreen Alpha Rage hardware platform at almost 14,000 points, thus confirming that the device is average in performance.  The rest of the benchmarks in general with AnTuTu agree. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/444/b18/f8b/444b18f8b4163fc6ef500e9829a2ebbe.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af1/34f/c67/af134fc67a3f4fc7625f139174be89ab.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/039/d8f/5d9/039d8f5d9459edb3cf408ede3b065db5.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0c6/778/e2f/0c6778e2f1da3cb23ffef87fc3ffac60.png"><br><br><h4>  OS - "naked" Android 4.2 </h4><br>  Clean and unencumbered by any Android 4.2 add-ons is what Highscreen Alpha Rage manages.  With a small amount of RAM, this is a fat plus, there is no unnecessary reason to unload unnecessary applications from memory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/62b/c19/d82/62bc19d82bb65717063edeb13a004b5d.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/83f/557/875/83f557875e8fb60a2f93232c92ddf5de.png"><br><br>  Of the programs installed by the developers, there is a file manager (not bad, but was replaced by a more familiar ES Explorer), an FM receiver with good sensitivity, a video player (not used since I installed BS Player right away) and a music player.  The latter is pleased with the possibility of turning on the bass boost function and giving the sound depth (3D), but they do not add sound quality to the included headphones.  There is also a program for quick access to the cloud storage 4Sync (20 GB "exclusive" for the model, otherwise - 15 GB), if you suddenly had little space on Dropbox. <br><br>  Separate menu items allow you to quickly check system updates, turn on 3G sharing via Wi-Fi, and back up data to a memory card. <br><br><h4>  Camera </h4><br>  The cameras in Highscreen Alpha Rage are shot in satisfactory quality.  Actually, the face is forgivable, there is no special quality required, but I would like more from the main one. <br>  With good ambient light on the machine, the pictures turn out to be quite good in terms of detail and noise, but still dusky - one cannot do without exposure correction.  The color rendition is slightly inclined to cold tones, but this is more or less typical of almost all smartphones. <br>  With a lack of light, white balance suffers, there are noises and problems in the operation of autofocus, which was also, in general, expected.  But what I did not expect was the functionality of the camera menu.  There is a smart auto mode, panorama shooting mode and HDR!  Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised by such an abundance of possibilities from such an affordable device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/96b/d38/51c/96bd3851ca436698a2d27be1ecf64efc.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5f0/eb6/207/5f0eb6207804079ed890dc4d26df116c.jpg"><br><br>  The camera writes video with a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels at a speed of 30 frames per second. <br><br><h4>  Verdict </h4><br>  On the face of horrible, kind inside - this is just about Highscreen Alpha Rage.  Repellent in appearance, this smartphone has a good set of consumer qualities (no matter how bad it sounds), especially considering the low price.  Therefore, it is not surprising that the target audience demonstrates (judging by the thematic forums) an increased interest in it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/204842/">https://habr.com/ru/post/204842/</a></p>
