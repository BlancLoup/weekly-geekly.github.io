This is an assessment of the great work that the company did in 2011, helping non-profit organizations and all those for whom life is almost impossible without outside help.  There are a huge number of such people, children, communities and organizations, and all of them vitally need attention and time.  Fortunately, IBM has a lot of volunteering experience in Russia - more than half of all company employees in 2011 spent a total of 3,500 hours of their personal time volunteering in various fields. <br><br>  The main reason IBM won the first place in the nomination is that within the framework of its 100th anniversary, the company concentrated on gratuitous help to those who need it.  Of the 120 different volunteer programs conducted by 107 companies and non-profit organizations last year, we were honored to be the first.  What did we do? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I will quote Kirill Korniliev, CEO of IBM in Russia and the CIS: ‚ÄúOur desire to bring some benefit to society by sharing our experience, resources and knowledge led many to appreciate the efforts made by IBM.  We do what helps our company and society at the same time.  I believe that we will continue to participate in volunteer projects and our involvement will be deeper and stronger. ‚Äù

      In addition, IBM has participated in various educational projects at universities, schools and even kindergartens - organizing holidays for the youngest, introducing them to new technologies in an exciting way. <br><br>  In addition to individual assistance from IBM employees, within the framework of its 100th anniversary, the company supported a wide variety of organizations, including non-profit organizations helping children, the disabled, environmental initiatives, etc.  IBM has allocated 7 grants to help non-profit organizations, including: AIESEC, Big Brothers Big Sisters, Charitable Foundation Downside Up, non-profit partnership of foster families Obshche Kitezh, Charity Foundation Big Change, Charity Foundation Volunteers to help orphans ‚Äù, the charitable foundation‚Äú Children's Hospital ‚Äùat the Children's Clinical Hospital ‚Ññ 9 named after  G.N.  Speransky.  These funds will go to the good cause of helping all those who need, as well as the development of joint projects, during which IBM employees transfer their professional knowledge and experience (skills-based volunteering). <br><br>  For most of our employees, this was the first experience of volunteering.  As already mentioned, about half of the employees of the Russian office spent their personal time and energy helping to make other people's lives better, better, and happier.  We are pleased that our goodwill was so highly appreciated not only by the Moscow government, but, most importantly, by the people we helped. <br><br>  IBM in Russia and the CIS countries thanks each volunteer individually and all together - thanks to our joint efforts, we helped make 2011 a truly happy year for many people!  We spent our time and energy not in vain, because what makes someone's life better, makes us better too.  We want to transfer the spirit of volunteering and volunteering to 2012 and carry it on, without forgetting that by helping each other, we help ourselves. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1a5/458/02c/1a545802cf23612f888cd8631f2ce724.jpg"></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139286/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139286/</a></p>
