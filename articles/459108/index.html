On the contrary, many company employees are enthusiastic and plan to surprise existing and potential buyers <a href="https://electrek.co/2019/06/18/tesla-surprises-second-half-year/">in the second half of this year</a> . <br><br>  Actually, the first half marked itself with a number of new products, including shipping the basic version of the Tesla Model 3 electric car and launching the Supercharger V3 high-speed charging.  In the near future, much more interesting new products are planned.  About several of them - in the sequel. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Update Tesla Model S and Model X </h3><br>  Every year the company modifies existing versions of electric vehicles.  So, the flagships received an upgrade of the engine and chassis this year.  In the next few months, the company plans to update the design of the Model S and Model X salons. Some details of the upcoming changes leaked to the Internet.

Not so long ago, Tesla acquired the company Maxwell, which has developed a number of technological innovations for batteries.  In the near future, the technologies obtained will be integrated into the Tesla electric vehicle battery production cycle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/768/8f1/7ad/7688f17ad815d5d2c4128b29a7a86498.jpg"><br><br>  According to experts, the new technology will provide an opportunity to reduce the cost of production, increase the energy density of batteries, increase the autonomous mode of operation of electric vehicles and introduce a number of new innovations. <br><br><h3>  Freight electric car </h3><br>  Rumors have been circulating about him for a long time, good, Tesla constantly feeds them.  A few months ago, the company laid out a render (or just a very darkened picture) of what could be part of an electric truck (this would not be a tractor, but a pickup truck).  According to Mask, the design of the vehicle is very futuristic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fa4/d82/188/fa4d821887c3e20dadfe4a5f114af692.jpg"><br><br>  According to Mask, Tesla Pickup will cost less than $ 50,000, and its characteristics will be better than many analogues.  It will be presented in the second half of this year. <br><br><h3>  Tesla Insurance </h3><br>  Another new product is the insurance program for owners of electric vehicles of the company.  Details will appear in the near future, as far as can be understood, in the next few months. <br><br>  The company has been working on this program for a long time ‚Äî about two years.  A test launch of the insurance program was performed in Australia and Hong Kong.  In addition, a pilot version has been launched in North America. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d60/983/d5a/d60983d5ade5060b28bd9e53b9c5b62c.jpg"><br><br>  But in a few months a much more substantial update is planned, at least the company promises to release a more profitable product for customers. <br><br>  Now Tesla is awaiting approval by regulators to launch this program. <br><br><h3>  Perhaps this is not all </h3><br>  By the end of the year there may be a few more surprises, it is clear that now the company is trying its best to get as many customers as possible. <br><br>  By the way, just a few days ago it became known that the company has achieved record levels of production and sales of electric vehicles.  For the second quarter of this year, she delivered about 100 thousand cars to customers.  For three months, Tesla produced, in addition to the already delivered 95.2 thousand 87 thousand electric cars.  Most sales accounted for Tesla Model 3. This model is sold in tens of thousands - from the named delivery volume of Model 3 amounted to 72.5 thousand.  Well, thanks to this result, the company's shares began to grow gradually - now they have grown by 7% in over-the-counter trading. <br><br>  What do you think, what else could be new from Tesla in the near future? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/459108/">https://habr.com/ru/post/459108/</a></p>
