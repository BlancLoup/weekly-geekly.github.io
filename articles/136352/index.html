  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Change your hard disk on your MacBook Pro in three clicks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Or, how to change the hard drive, using only a screwdriver and pliers. <br><br>  Imagine a simple situation: you wanted to upgrade your computer and install a new hard disk on it.  In general, for a personal computer and for a laptop, the scenario is the same.  Make a backup using some Acronis (PC) or Carbon Copy Cloner (Mac) on an external or second internal hard drive;  We catch a new disk, boot from the backup and restore it to a new disk.  Is done. <br><br>  Now let's imagine another, more common situation.  You are the most common average man in the street, under 50 years old, who can hardly imagine how he works.  Use only the software that came with the computer and do not know about the scenario above.  Your actions?  If you are the owner of the recording, the only option is to contact a friend who, for sure, collected the car for you.  However, if you are the owner of MacBook and enjoy life in some Thailand, then your actions are reduced to three clicks.  Oh well.  I was deceiving.  You will also need a screwdriver and pliers. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Task </h4><br><img src="http://unglued.ru.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/images/C360_2012-01-14-04-02-23.jpg" align="right">  Install a new hard drive on a MacBook Pro running Mac OS X Lion, having at hand only a screwdriver, pliers, Time Capsule (yes, no matter what reliable technology anyone is safe, so backups!) ".  Subtask: do everything lying in a hammock without any power connections, to the hard disk via usb, without flash drives, without disks, without a mouse, without all that needs to be plugged anywhere. <br><br>  For myself, I chose a <strong>750 GB Seagate Momentus XT</strong> .  I will not dwell on the reasons.  Remember, I am an ordinary man in the street: I saw an article in a magazine, I wanted to buy it. <br><br><h4>  Replacement </h4><br>  Turn off the computer.  Remove the back cover, pick out the old hard. <br><br><img src="http://unglued.ru.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/images/C360_2012-01-14-04-12-36.jpg"><br><br>  Remove from his studs.  The main problem is that the studs are screwed with Torx (a slotted screw in the shape of a six-pointed star).  Well, I do not have such a screwdriver and never did.  But there are pliers.  Remembering the vibration of planting studs on the latch.  The bolt lock is a small deviation from the script, but by the will of fate I have it, and it is a sin not to use it. <br><br><img src="http://unglued.ru.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/images/C360_2012-01-14-04-17-55.jpg"><br><br>  Close the lid.  Everything.  The hardest part is complete.  Tools can be removed, get comfortable in a hammock and enjoy freshly brewed coffee, using the old screw as a stand for a mug. <br><br><h4>  Recovery </h4><br><img src="http://unglued.ru.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/images/C360_2012-01-14-04-31-41.jpg" align="left">  When you turn on the laptop, a mysterious folder icon with a question mark appears on the screen.  Which, as it seems to me, can be easily replaced with <strong>o_O emoticon</strong> .  It means that the operating system is not found.  It is not clear.  Reboot the laptop and hold down the <em>Option</em> key (it‚Äôs also <em>Alt</em> , it‚Äôs <em>‚å•</em> ).  After this, the MacBook will boot into Recovery HD mode.  Not finding any external drives, the system immediately picks up the nearest Wi-Fi and offers to recover via the Internet.  That's it, and no disks with resuscitator. <br><br><img src="http://unglued.ru.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/images/C360_2012-01-14-04-33-00.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://unglued.ru.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/images/C360_2012-01-14-04-35-01.jpg" align="right">  15 minutes and the system booted in recovery mode.  Then you can either restore everything from Time Machine, or set the axis again.  In the latter case, it will also be downloaded from the Internet.  It will not ask for any licenses or passwords from Apple ID and other nonsense.  Implied, if you were able to download Recovery HD, it means that you already have at least Lion, then once you have already purchased it (or merged from torrents&gt;: D).  Choose a disk with backup and click continue.  By the way, you can restore the state to any date that is in the Time Capsule. <br><br><img src="http://unglued.ru.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/images/C360_2012-01-14-04-49-04.jpg"><br><br>  Everything.  After some time, the MacBook will reboot and you can continue to watch the movie from where you left off.  Yes, the Resume function worked here. <br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br>  I don‚Äôt say that this is the best and fastest way.  It is simply incredibly convenient and simple.  Of course, you can use an external USB hard drive as Time Machine - it will be much faster than dragging a half-byte over Wi-Fi.  By the way, my configuration was the slowest possible: the backup is stored on an external hard drive connected via USB to the Time Capsule, and all the files are encrypted using FileVault. <br><br><img src="http://unglued.ru.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/images/C360_2012-01-14-04-55-46.jpg"><br><br>  Therefore, my MacBook rocked all night and half the next day.  I just wanted to demonstrate the streamlined and ‚Äúcreeping‚Äù of the process. <br><br>  Of the problems that got out right away, I want to mention only the flown password from Dropbox and the favicon of bookmarks in chrome.  At one of the forums, a question was asked about data integrity in MySQL databases (if any).  Checked, everything is in place. <br><br>  In general, and in general, I am extremely pleased that Apple has once again proved that they do everything for people. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136352/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136352/</a></p>
