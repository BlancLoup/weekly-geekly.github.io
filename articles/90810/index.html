      Your hosting account has been reviewed by our administrators due to <br>  excessive CPU utilization and memory consumption. <br><br>  We have determined that your <br>  account for our shared hosting environment.  The pages in <br>  questions are: <br><br>  msug.vn.ua <br><br>  If you are unable to fix this problem, you can offer you 2 alternative solutions: <br><br>  1) It will take you a $ 23 / month setup.  For more information please review <a href="http://www.mochahost.com/vps.php">www.mochahost.com/vps.php</a> or <br><br>  2) If you can get to <a href="http://www.mochahost.com/linux_dedicated_cloud.php">www.mochahost.com/linux_dedicated_cloud.php</a> <br><br>  Please respond within 24 hours.  If you do not hear back from you within 24 <br>  your account might be suspended. <br><br>  We appreciate your prompt response and cooperation. <br><br>  Please let us know if we can help you further. <br><br>  Sincerely <br><br>  MochaSupport Team <br>  2880 Zanker Rd # 203, <br>  San Jose, CA 95134 <br>  <a href="http://www.mochahost.com/">www.MochaHost.com</a> <br>  support@mochasupport.com </blockquote><br><br>  To which a clear answer was given: ‚ÄúPlease enable VPS account.‚Äù <br><br>  But before I could fully realize what was happening, the site was already blocked after 5 (!) Minutes. <br><br>  After long conversations in Live Help, they simply blocked me there. <br><br>  Some lyrics: <br>  <i>After unpleasant adventures with hosting.ua, about which I already wrote, it was decided to find a good western hoster, under which mochahost, in principle, fell.</i>  <i>Yes, the site works on a Community Server, which is not that it eats little memory, but nevertheless the load of 1000 hosts per day should not have a big impact on the server of the No. 1 host (as they themselves write it).</i>  <i>For 4 months, about 50 tickets were opened, to which the load does not relate in any way - they have a server gone out, the spammers tried, or in general, they did not know what was going on there.</i>  <i>And yes, I know that you need to take a dedicated server to be confident in your project.</i>  <i>But I can not understand why to do this for a non-commercial site with a relatively small audience?</i> <br><br>  So the disadvantages of hosting, which I encountered: <ul><li>  almost all the goodies (remote access, backups, etc.) are disabled by default - you need to write requests to turn them on </li><li>  more buggy system than Parallels Plesk I have not seen.  If the channel is 4MB / s, the login page loads seconds 15 </li><li>  Support often hangs up noodles, but with the weight of arguments they give up </li><li>  at Live Help to find out at least something is simply unrealistic - as a result, it doesn‚Äôt need nafig </li></ul>  In fact, the site worked well only during the test period, immediately after the replenishment of the bourgeois account, problems immediately began. <br><br>  Clarification: this is all going on a business account with full anlim at all.  For the sake of fairness, it‚Äôs necessary to add that I have achieved an additional free month of services from them for poor-quality hosting, but this is no easier. <br><br>  They responded to my letter of the clock after 8 hours - when we had a deep night, their answer was just a find for KOs: <br><blockquote>  We‚Äôve been causing this.  As we said, please consider upgrading to a VPS or Dedicated server. </blockquote>  And this is despite the fact that I wrote them about the activation of VPS. <br><br>  Now the site is not working, for which I apologize our readers, among whom are habrovchane. <br><br>  In a month, I hope, we will have our own server, let's see what happens.  In the meantime, you have to clench your teeth and wait for the manna from the side of the mochahost. <br><br>  <i>PS I know that progg.ru is also hosted by them and periodically I observe the same problems as we do.</i>  <i>Or I'm wrong?</i> <br><br>  <b>Update 13.04 17:50 in Kiev.</b> <br><br>  After 9 hours of waiting, a response from mochahost came: <br><blockquote>  Upgrade your MochaHost account form;  Thank you! ~ </blockquote><br>  Those.  9 hours to send an offer to change your account (although we talked about this almost a day ago)! <br><br>  But it's' too late.  We practically moved - it's only for DNS. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90810/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90810/</a></p>
