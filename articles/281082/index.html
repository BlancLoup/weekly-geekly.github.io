Guided by the principle of ‚Äúteach others and understand yourself,‚Äù I wrote what you are reading now.  I would be glad if my experience is useful to someone.  I also welcome expert comments and opinions of experienced people who had to work with such systems. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  But first, a small lyrical digression for those who do not quite understand what they mean. <br><br>  Today I am convinced: KVM is a very promising and at the same time the only technology that allows you to build a functional, flexible and manageable matrix network of anything:

    <ul><li>  UNIX / Windows / Mac / Sun servers, </li><li>  video cameras and video players, </li><li>  equipment for diagnostics and monitoring of everything, </li><li>  power, lighting, temperature control modules </li><li>  construction cranes, oil pumps, </li><li>  washing machines, finally (if only they will be with video outputs and HID interfaces) </li></ul><br>  In other words, thanks to KVM technology, it is already possible to rule the world.  And if this is KVM over IP, then not even rising from the couch.  It is clear that so far only the world of electronics, but cyborgization is just around the corner, so who knows ... <br><br>  In the meantime, we will be content with what we have.  All you need to control anything of the above is a display and a keyboard with a mouse (well, either a joystick, or a touchpad, or a trackball, or a steering wheel with pedals ‚Äî someone you like more).  And, of course, some of the solutions of matrix switching. <br><br>  <i>- But what's so special?</i>  - you ask.  - <i>After all, there are thin clients, GSM-modules, and IP-console with built-in KVM-switch is not new.</i>  <i>All this also allows you to remotely control the equipment without getting up from the sofa.</i> <br><br>  <i>- Also, but not the same</i> , - I answer mysteriously. <br><br>  Firstly, world domination should be enjoyable.  Therefore, capricious for software and slow thin clients are dismissed immediately (after updating the OS on your washing machine you will not only have to get off the couch, but, very likely, drag the sofa itself). <br><br>  Secondly, as we know, those in power often suffer from paranoia.  And especially for paranoids, KVM provides the ability to remotely control not through the vulnerable TCP / IP or GSM protocol, but directly through cables that can only be cut, but no one can do this because you will hide them in a closed server room, behind which, by the way, also be able to watch remotely. <br><br>  Thirdly, divide and conquer.  It is not necessary to shoulder the burden of managing the world.  You can dial a dozen or two quick assistants and scatter duties between them.  But a) they need to be controlled, b) even the most conscientious assistants can faint, therefore it is necessary to provide for their operational interchangeability.  In addition, sooner or later it may be necessary to train new assistants before allowing them to full control.  And all this is provided in all Matrix KVM solutions without exception, which allow the administrator to fine-tune access rights for user groups or for each user individually, and for users to instantly switch between managed systems. <br><br>  But the most important difference from other remote connection methods is that <b>KVM technologies provide the ability to distribute signals from one source with their one-time broadcast to many workplaces</b> .  That is, with the same system, video can be displayed on Vasya and Fedi‚Äôs displays, and audio in Petit‚Äôs headphones.  And the whole system will be managed by Gennady Petrovich.  The work of the majority of command and control points is based on this principle.  And that is exactly what matrix switching is. <br><br>  So, <b>matrix switching is when multiple users can connect to multiple systems in any dynamically tuned combinations</b> : <br><br><ul><li>  one user - many systems; </li><li>  many users - one system; </li><li>  many users - many systems. </li></ul><br>  To the question of how much it is - a lot, we will return in our comparative table, and in general, 2x2 switching systems can already be considered matrix (2 users, each of whom can manage 2 systems from his or her workplace).  However, in this case, we are interested in matrices that are really impressive.  That is, the matrix with the total number of points (systems and users) over 100. And what is important is available in Russia. <br><br><h2>  We build a matrix network </h2><br>  When building a matrix network, two global tasks are solved: <br><br><ol><li>  Extension of video, audio, USB HID and various necessary peripheral signals; </li><li>  Construction of the matrix.  That is, the organization of flexibly configured and managed real-time user access to systems. </li></ol><br>  The first task is solved by selecting the "correct" KVM extenders.  For the successful solution of the second problem is the matrix switch.  It seems that everything is simple: I chose one, I chose another - I switched, I set up.  But since matrix switching is a complex solution, and usually only native extension cords can be connected to the matrix switch, choosing the optimal solution is difficult. <br><br>  So, what requirements do we take into account when solving these two problems? <br><br><h3>  Signal lengthening </h3><br>  <b>Standards of transmitted signals</b> .  Standard set is video, audio and USB HID or PS / 2.  Sometimes you need USB 2.0, less often - USB 3.0 and RS-232, even less often - other peripheral signals. <br><br>  Meanwhile, standard-quality video and audio can also be analog or digital.  A digital video can be DVI, DP, HDMI, etc. In general, it is also very different. <br><br>  <b>Video quality and data rate</b> .  Physics is relentless: the higher the video resolution, the lower the signal transmission speed over long distances.  Meanwhile, the most advanced matrix switching systems allow you to transmit video over large distances in 4K resolution, and the delay will be measured in milliseconds. <br><br>  Another thing is that with an increase in the available video resolution, the price of a KVM extender is directly proportional. <br><br>  <b>Medium and maximum data transfer distance</b> .  Switching is possible 1) directly on optics (Fiber MM or SM) or twisted pair (CATx);  2) by IP network. <br><br>  When switching directly from each extension cable (both from transmitters and from receivers), a separate wire must be pulled to the matrix, that is, a separate cable system must actually be built for the matrix. <br><br>  When switching over IP, transmitters connect to a regular network switch, and receivers connect to standard power outlets at user workstations.  With KVM over IP, you can use a standard, existing network infrastructure.  Also, a matrix switcher is not needed to build KVM over IP matrices. <br><br>  With a direct connection, the greater the transmission distance of the video signal, the greater the loss and distortion in it.  For KVM over IP, the distance does not matter.  See diagram: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13c/e9e/c51/13ce9ec51607acd3da2e83123971bb97.jpg" alt="Dependence of video signal quality on transmission medium and distance"><br><br><h3>  Matrix organization </h3><br>  Parameters for which the matrix switch is directly responsible: <br><br>  <b>The size of the matrix.</b>  <b>Scalable</b> .  The possible number of connected users and systems.  Matrices can be with static ports (separately Input, separate Output) or dynamic (I / O), with a limited number of ports or modularly expandable.  It is clear that the most flexible and convenient for scaling solutions are based on matrix switches of a modular architecture with dynamic ports, so we will compare such solutions. <br><br>  <b>Creating groups and the flexibility of setting user rights</b> .  Rights management options vary.  For example, some users should have the right to control the system, others only to view, and still others should not have the right to connect, etc. In addition, different matrix switches present their own proprietary management interfaces, which can also be convenient to a greater or lesser extent. degree. <br><br>  <b>Tools for centralized connection management</b> .  Through the web interface, through the software on the management console, through the remote OSD menu, etc. <br><br>  <b>Fault tolerance</b> .  The possibility of network redundancy, the possibility of hot-swappable components of the matrix switch, backup power. <br><br>  <b>Other chips</b> .  Automatic backups, centralized firmware updates, menu Russification, settings copying, log uploading, etc. <br><br>  Well, the last criterion, which relates mostly not to the matrix switch, but to the entire solution: <br><br>  <b>The speed and convenience of switching between systems, the ability to create multi-system multi-monitor jobs</b> .  The maximum number of monitors per system, the maximum number of systems that can be controlled by one user.  Possibilities of switching between systems (by moving the mouse cursor, via the OSD menu, via the control panel, etc.). <br><br>  Actually, these are all basic parameters that may differ in matrix switching solutions of KVM signals.  Meanwhile, not every solution can find such detailed information (and often even the official equipment distributors are not aware of all the capabilities of the systems). <br><br>  Therefore, for the time being, I can compare solutions for some - basic - parameters. <br><br><h2>  Matrix KVM: Comparison of Solutions </h2><br>  Matrix switching solutions for comparison selected the most large-scale ones (allowing to connect at least 100 points) and scalable ones.  These are flagship solutions of the most prominent KVM equipment manufacturers in Russia and Europe: <b>Aten, Adder, Guntermann &amp; Drunck, IHSE, Rose Orion, Thinklogical</b> . <br><br>  First - brief descriptions of solutions, just below - a comparative table of key parameters. <br><br>  <i><b>Is important</b> .</i>  <i>Concerning the pros and cons here.</i>  <i>I noted not that the advantages and disadvantages, but those parameters that differ in this or that solution from their own kind, and the parameters that are responsible for the flexibility of the systems as a whole.</i>  <i>In a particular project, any of these solutions may be appropriate, depending on the tasks.</i> <br><br><h3>  Aten </h3>  <a href="http://aten.com/products/productFind.php%3Fr%3D6121%26catid%3D12%26catagory%3DKVM_Extenders">www.aten.com</a> <br><br>  KVM over IP.  The network is built entirely on extensions (KE69xx), which can be managed centrally through a Java application installed on any server connected to the same IP network. <br><br>  <b>Pros</b> : <br><br><ul><li>  inexpensive compared to other solutions </li><li>  convenient to scale (you can start with a pair of "receiver-transmitter" and build up the network as required, simply by purchasing extension cables) </li><li>  VGA support </li></ul><br>  <b>Cons</b> : <br><br><ul><li>  cannot control the matrix remotely </li><li>  Taiwanese assembly </li></ul><br><h3>  Adder </h3>  <a href="http://www.adder.com/products/category/kvm-over-ip">www.adder.com</a> <br><br>  KVM over IP.  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãalso based on extenders (ALIF), which can work either autonomously (including in a point-to-point configuration) or under the control of a so-called control center (server) - AIM (AdderLink Infinity Manager), which allows you to manage connections and distribute KVM signals centrally.  It is also possible to create multi-system multi-monitor workstations (USB-switch CSS-PRO4 is required). <br><br>  <b>Pros</b> : <br><br><ul><li>  ability to remotely control the matrix </li><li>  convenient to scale (you can start with a pair of "receiver-transmitter" and build up the network as required, simply by purchasing extension cables) </li><li>  Support 2K resolution. </li><li>  Extenders with dual network cards, i.e.  it is possible to work through two networks simultaneously (for example, on CatX and on optics, or in a closed and open network) </li></ul><br>  <b>Cons</b> : <br><br><ul><li>  DVI-D only </li><li>  In the case of building a matrix without a management server, it is impossible to manage the matrix centrally. </li></ul><br><h3>  Guntermann &amp; Drunck </h3>  <a href="http://www.gdsys.de/en/products/digital-kvm-matrix-systems/">www.gdsys.de</a> <br><br>  The network is based on a matrix switch with dynamic ports. <br><br>  <b>Pros</b> : <br><br><ul><li>  The minimum switch format is 16 I / O ports </li><li>  Supports 2K and 4K resolutions </li><li>  In addition to standard DVI-D, supports VGA and DP </li></ul><br>  <b>Cons</b> : <br><br><ul><li>  Matrix switches are modular, but partially.
