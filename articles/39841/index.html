  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Alternative Education 2.0 in the era of funk</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://brainstream.ru/images/index_02.gif"><br>  Good day friends and colleagues! <br><br>  In the light of the onset of the new academic season, I would like to discuss with you the issue of the crisis of modern education and find out your opinion about the new startup in the educational sector ‚Äú <a href="http://www.brainstream.ru/">Brainstream.ru</a> ‚Äù <br>  I would like to share with you the main thoughts about the problems of the current education system and where it should move at all. <br>  Since I was born grew up and received my education in Russia, I will speak about him.  And more precisely - about the humanities and business education, considering that its technical field in our country, despite all the problems, is still at a super high level! <br><br>  We all know perfectly well that the modern general education system, beginning at school, kills individuality and creative initiative in children and adolescents, in the absolute majority of schools. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  (even if it is a Gymnasium at least an ordinary general school) children are not taught but forced to report.  Under the false flags of diversity and choice, the system imperceptibly guides people along one common path - plunging bright minds into the free cell of the matrix and firmly freezing ‚ÄúGod's sparks‚Äù.  It would seem that this global information mechanism for the transformation of individuality into a soulless economic resource is ideal and works flawlessly.  This is especially vividly observed in places inseparable from the remnants of the ‚ÄúSoviet legacy‚Äù, where the word individuality could put an end to further human life in Soviet society. <br><img src="http://www.welcometoherefordshire.com/images/School_Sign.jpg">

      But there were always people who challenged the system.  They opened their eyes, stored courage and began a conscious life.  They went their own way, different from the generally accepted rules and regulations.  They recalled that the meaning of life in the constant pursuit of new goals and creation is paired with God himself.  Thus, moving contrary to the system, these prominent personalities occupied key positions in it, played the first roles.  These people are successful businessmen, stars of art and show business.  People sincerely loving their work, and making a bet on the love of the process, and not the love of cash flow. <br>  Everybody has these last names: Jobs, Gates, Branson, Dymov, Tinkov, Bocharsky, Chichvarkin, Avetisyan and many other worthy people whose names I cannot remember, but actively use the result of their mental work :) <br><img src="http://img167.imageshack.us/img167/3879/picture2zv5.png"><br><br>  Modern business ‚Äúin the era of funk‚Äù requires from every person the impossible - to be a leader with super abilities. Be, if you will, God - combining a thousand skills, creative intelligence, abilities to concentrate, look and breadth of interests covering all areas of the universe.  According to the majority, this is the ‚Äúreal entrepreneur‚Äù - and it is precisely these super talents who dream of getting top corporations for themselves. <br><br>  The main problems of education today are the discrepancy with the speed of the new media world and the underestimation of the development of the creative side of the personality.  It is about imagination and the ability to transform fiction into reality.  This is possible, but it also needs to be learned.  In the first place - independently and in practice.  But this requires some kind of pushing impulses.  In the 1990s, such impulses were natural in Russia ‚Äî the desire to live better.  What now?  From the earliest years, children have ‚Äúeverything‚Äù.  They lose interest, a false sense of satiety appears.  There is always something to strive for and where to grow, but many simply don‚Äôt think about it.  If this striving at first glance seems so far away, complicated and unstable, then why risk it?  It is better to relax and surrender to the flow.  Downshifting in action! <br><br>  Creative expert Sir Kin Robinson <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html">in his speech</a> 2 years ago talked about how the British school system stifles creativity in children, and how society can solve this problem. <br>  What resources need to attract?  What tools are needed for this?  Who should lead this movement? <br><br>  At <a href="http://www.brainstream.ru/">Brainstream,</a> we believe that regular (1-2 times a month) seminars with the participation of bright personalities are capable of creating a serious information mechanism.  The seminar was attended by 150 people, they shared their impressions with their friends.  It was 150, it became 1000. Next - more.  Natural distribution of the idea. <br><br>  We believe that the organization of conferences like <a href="http://www.ted.com/">TED</a> , open forums for the free distribution of ideas - accessible to any member of our society (from schoolchildren to 80 years old academicians of the Russian Academy of Sciences) is capable of introducing a rift into the existing education system.  It is able to influence the younger generation that can really change the reality around them, and which needs <b>EXPERIENCE SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE</b> , the interaction with which they are practically deprived. Rejecting academic touch and establishing an atmosphere of free communication where Yevgeny Chichvarkin will be able to openly say the word <b>x @ y</b> expressing his thoughts we can understand the world of these incomprehensible but successful people <br><br>  We would like to hold our first forum this fall, perhaps in the middle of October. It will be devoted to the above-mentioned problem and the search for methods to solve it.  We want to create a truly unique solution in the field of new education, education 2.0 which would cover all the ‚Äúhot‚Äù topics of modernity: new media, new business, web N + 1 and many other areas that are not yet open to the academic environment. <br><br>  We want to hear your opinion, the opinion of those who are in charge of their own lives and believe that they can change the system. What topics would you be interested in?  What kind of people would you call?  What would you ask them?  What would you change? <br><br>  After all, education is the future of each of us ... <br><br>  <i>PS:</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Perhaps this text will seem serious and pompous to you, but in fact it is not so!</i>  <i>:) we are a team of young torn-off guys, getting high from their work and aware of the fact that together we can do more!</i>  <i>I hope watching our "video" will confirm this fact;)</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Thank you, your <a href="http://www.brainstream.ru/">Brainstream</a> ;)</i> <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/nqV6VFRfVPQ&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjjq9irnGtNOEdFjv5eRH1I7fQqfQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/39841/">https://habr.com/ru/post/39841/</a></p>
