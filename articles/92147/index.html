  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Organizing everything ... or missing something?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently I considered my own work experience and was a little horrified - this turned out to be a round number.  And about how, during this time, technologies for managing tasks ‚Äî workers and personal ‚Äî have made a step.  And, using them with might and main, today you involuntarily think about it - and how did we ever work before? <br><br>  My first ‚ÄúSaaS solution‚Äù, available to me absolutely anywhere (if I, of course, did not forget it in some other place or did not lose it), is a small paper notebook.  The diaries, like many other things in the early 90s, were in short supply - it could only be found last year, if at all, found in a small county town. <br><img src="http://www.solvermate.ru/upload/habr/habr_diary.jpg" alt="image"><br>  A notebook (and then a diary) seemed like the perfect means of doing things.  Although sometimes things did not fit on one page (or it was not at hand) and then there were heaps of leaves, which were constantly mixed and confused all the cards.  And, of course, strained constant writing and the need to rewrite the new pages of those cases that could not be done on time or that were postponed to other dates. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  For a long time, the pager served as a ‚Äúreminder‚Äù of especially important matters, calls and meetings.  In principle, it is convenient - at the right time you have a ‚Äúbell‚Äù, and immediately everything you need is at hand - the name, phone, place, etc. The main thing is to dictate everything to the operator in advance by phone and at the same time that no one of the two is wrong :)

      With the advent of the CCP, it has become much easier, but I still cannot understand how to use meetings and tasks together in them.  This was misleading for me - and I constantly forgot something ‚Äî the tasks to see, then the meetings.  Plus, permanent problems with synchronization with a computer - more than once it turned out that everything was expired since the last synchronization: (I tried to change one PDA to another - it's useless, everything is done as if for a carbon copy - everyone has the same thing, a little better, a little worse. <br><br>  Very imbued with simple means like RememberTheMilk - but they are effective only for small household, personal affairs, not for work ... <br><br>  Now I use <a href="http://www.solvermate.ru/">SolverMate</a> - on the one hand, this is patriotic :), and on the other hand, you need to know the product, if you really want to talk about it.  What can I say about this my personal user history: <br><br>  1. The list of tasks / tasks is always up to date - right now. <br>  2. Meetings and tasks in a single timeline - that no longer becomes me :) <br>  3. All cases are always sorted by urgency - you know exactly what to do now. <br>  4. Work tasks, personal - all together. <br>  5. Notes, correspondence in the case, all of this remains in the task log. <br>  6. All that did not have time today - it goes by itself to the next working day, besides it becomes higher in priority. <br>  7. It is possible to record the time spent on the task, and it will automatically fall into the working time records - this is useful for reporting to management and / or customers. <br><br>  Business feedback is not quite convenient yet - various notifications come only via email.  But colleagues promised to finish the notification system integrated into the diary in the near future, and then it would be necessary to think hard what else could you want. <br><br>  That is what I want to ask the community: what other functionality would you like to have in <a href="http://www.solvermate.ru/">such a system</a> , if you used it? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92147/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92147/</a></p>
