  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Three month programmer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Almost everyone can remember an outstanding classmate who has not developed his talent.  The story is indicative for me, as one of my classmates to the 11th grade knew three languages ‚Äã‚Äãand could speak them fluently, but then she got the specialty ‚Äúaccountant‚Äù, languages ‚Äã‚Äãgradually forgotten. <br><br>  Often our parents influence our choices.  They want us to get a lot of money, which means they insist on choosing a future profession.  Particularly acute, this situation is felt in countries where there were no large-scale crises, and where a lawyer or doctor always received a lot.  For example, a child has a talent for drawing, he uses a ballpoint pen to draw pictures in the style of Leonard da Vinci, and his father says: ‚ÄúThrow this stupid idea, go learn a lawyer‚Äù. <br><br>  Already more at a conscious age, these attitudes continue to dominate us.  When a person himself thinks: ‚ÄúWhere to go, where do they pay more?‚Äù.  This leads to such a phenomenon as "cattle-catcher".  But now I would like to talk not about this, but about such a phenomenon as ‚Äú2K programmer‚Äù.  I very much hoped that much had changed since then, but a large-scale problem came to light when there was a financial crisis in the United States.  Next comes a description of what happened in the United States, specifically, the city of New York.

Until 2000, computers counted the year according to the last two figures: 97, 98, 99. And in the two thousandth year they should have started from 00. For institutions like the bank, this would be very critical.  The ‚Äú2K problem‚Äù hysteria began, they began to hire massively programmers.  Soon the market dried up, and began to hire fresh students.  Partly, company managers covered up their soft spot.  Imagine if the crisis would have happened, the bank director calls the tech manager on the carpet: <br><br>  - Why did our bank lose the amount of 8 zeros? <br>  - I tried, Mr. Director, I hired 40 programmers to prevent the ‚Äú2K problem‚Äù. <br>  - But the competing bank hired 50 programmers, and they didn‚Äôt have any problems, maybe this is the problem?  Maybe you didn‚Äôt try enough? <br><br>  After the programmers ran out, a request was sent to educational institutions so that they would release more programmers.  Where did they get so much?  And the manager cannot go outside and shout to a nearby homeless person: ‚ÄúHey, do you want to receive 80 thousand dollars a year?‚Äù.  The manager will also be asked why he hired a man without a crust. <br><br>  Schools found a way out, they organized a three-month programming courses.  Imagine how cool, three months and you're already a programmer.  On these courses, examples of programs were written in a notebook.  Once a week, the code was typed on the computer.  It was enough for the manager that the applicant could stuff something on the computer and it works.  As the year 2000 approached, the courses were reduced from 3 months to two weeks. <br><br>  People told their friends how easy it is to find work for 80 thousand dollars a year, for 2 weeks!  Friends told acquaintances: ‚ÄúDo you remember that dude who recently bombered near our office?  So recently I met him in a suit.  It turns out that he went to study programmer and found a job.  Can you imagine what talent? ‚Äù  People who heard such a story naturally showed envy. <br><br>  Can I become a programmer in 2 weeks?  Of course it is impossible, especially since a person had previously seen a computer only in a shop window. <br>  Real programmers who were hired by the company long before the news of the ‚Äú2k problem‚Äù had to endure 45 digs that the manager hired.  They sat quietly, climbed on the halely Internet.  Yes, another 80 thousand dollars paid for it.  Life is a success. <br><br>  Some of this hired crowd quickly realized the situation, namely that if they did not start studying now, they would be reduced after 2000. <br><br>  And indeed, when the ‚Äú2K problem‚Äù did not materialize, a massive wave of layoffs passed.  At the construction site, it was possible to meet former programmers who told everyone how they worked at Leman Brothers Bank and were cut down by an evil manager.  It also caused a malicious smirk from former envious.  And sometimes from the same people to this day you can hear: "And why do you study as a programmer, if after 2000 you are not needed by anyone?". <br><br>  The same programmers who showed some hope, learned something, did not fall under reduction.  There is such a thing as "grow a programmer."  Look for a man with the makings of and teach him. <br><br>  Now remember my introductory word.  If a person has studied a profession that he does not like, he will never cultivate himself, he will not pull himself up.  This work will be in his mind, to seem boring.  Consequently, technical solutions will be terrible, do not reach the modern level. <br><br>  Here we are moving smoothly to the financial crisis of 2008. Which, thanks to subsidies, did not manifest itself immediately and some companies kept afloat until 2010.  In a tough financial situation, they were forced to review their entire staff.  Started another wave of cuts.  The staff left only really real programmers. <br><br>  And I began to meet unemployed programmers.  Imagine such a wild situation ‚ÄúA C programmer has been looking for a job for two years now.‚Äù  Sounds like a joke.  This is a low-level language in which drivers are written, OS kernels.  A real programmer in his spare time joins some open source project, Linux, for example.  His work is seen by other programmers, he gets the name among professionals.  Such people will never be unemployed. <br><br>  If you still have a question: ‚ÄúHow can a C programmer look for a job for two years?‚Äù, My answer to you is: ‚ÄúThis is the three-month programmer from the distant 90s who didn‚Äôt learn anything, but was lucky to keep his job until 2010 g. " <br><br>  But this is not the end.  Most recently, I spoke with a programmer who is afraid of losing his job.  For the past 13 years, he does not do anything.  His position is Senior Developer in a large American company.  He is the same three-month programmer.  He is already held in the workplace as a talisman. <br>  What does he do every day?  The manager will ask you to develop an architecture for the new database.  He searches the Internet for a standard scheme, prints it out, gives it to real programmers, they nod their heads and do everything in their own way.  Everyone is happy. <br>  If he loses his job, he will not be able to pass programming tests. <br>  That is why large corporations, such as Google, ask questions about round hatches in order to at least weed out three-month and two-week programmers, who nevertheless have solid experience in some large corporation. <br><br>  Thank you for reading.  I hope that no one will take it on a personal account.  I think everyone understands that we need real experts.  And the article itself was written to explain this phenomenon as an ‚Äúunemployed programmer.‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151111/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151111/</a></p>
