Recently, a bionic prosthesis was made that allowed a disabled person to control a new limb with the power of thought, just like an ordinary hand.  While the state is preparing <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/cloud4y/blog/441802/">legislative bases</a> for processing personal data in the clouds and creating <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/cloud4y/blog/445720/">virtual profiles of citizens</a> , what previously could only be found in works of science fiction, in a couple of decades can become a reality, and the preconditions for this are confirmed in the midst of fierce disputes with moralists and opposition scholars. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The Internet represents a global decentralized system that serves humanity and allows you to store, process and create information.  A significant part of the information rotates in the clouds.  Strategically, the interface between the human brain and the cloud (Human brain / Cloud Interface or abbreviated B / CI) can fulfill many of the dreams of a person.  The basis for creating such an interface is the hope for progress in technology that works on a molecular scale.  In particular, the development of "neuronanobot" seems promising.

      Future inventions will help in the treatment of many diseases of our body. <br><br>  Nanorobots can communicate remotely with the cloud and perform the necessary actions under their control, manipulating a variety of processes.  It is assumed that the bandwidth of a wireless connection with nanorobots will be up to ~ 6 x 10 ^ 16 bits per second. <br><br>  Research in the field of IT, nanotechnology and artificial intelligence, the number of which has grown exponentially, allows scientists to suggest the possibility of linking a biological organism to the World Wide Web in the next 19 years. <br><br>  The University of Berkeley and the Institute of Molecular Production in California <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2019.00276/full">have studied the issue</a> in <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2019.00276/full">detail</a> . <br><br>  According to research, the interface will establish a connection between neural connections in the brain and a vast powerful cloud, giving people access to immense computing power and a huge knowledge base of human civilization. <br>  A system with such an interface is supposed to control the nanobots that will be allowed access to the entire library of mankind. <br><br>  In addition to the mentioned interface, the possibilities for creating network connections directly between people's brains and other combinations of connections are considered.  Let's not forget about the new features for the Internet of Things. <br><br>  The cloud in turn means the IT paradigm and model for providing access to pools of highly customizable and scalable resources, such as computer networks, servers, storage, applications and services).  Such access is provided with a minimum of human resource management costs, minimal time and financial investment, and most often through the Internet. <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãconnecting the brain to the Internet is far from new.  It was first proposed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil">Raymond Kurzweil</a> , who believed that the B / CI interface would help people find the answers to their questions instantly and without waiting for the answer of the search engine with unpredictable and garbage results. <br><br>  Kurzweil gained fame for his technological predictions, which took into account the emergence of AI and the means of radically extending people's lives. <br><br>  He also substantiated technological singularity - unprecedentedly rapid progress, based on the power of AI and cyborgization of people. <br>  According to Kurzweil, evolutionary systems, including the development of technology, are progressing exponentially.  In the essay "The Law of Accelerating Return", he suggested that Moore's law can be extended to many other technologies, which speaks in favor of Ving's technical singularity. <br><br>  At the same time, the science fiction writer noted that our mind was used to doing linear extrapolations, and not to think exponentially.  That is, we can draw some linear conclusions, but not make jumps in reasonable activity exponentially and suddenly. <br><br>  The writer predicted that special devices will transmit images directly to the eyes, creating a virtual reality effect, and mobile phones will transmit sound via Bluetooth directly to the ear.  Google and Yandex will translate foreign texts well, small devices in conjunction with the Internet are closely integrated into our daily life. <br><br>  Computer test passing Turing Kurzweil predicted in 2029, the year, while the machine passed it more than a decade before the mentioned date.  This suggests that scientists' forecasts can come true sooner than we expect. <br>  Although, on the other hand, the program imitated the intellect of a 13-year-old child and the passing of the Turing test still does not unequivocally indicate any decisive achievements of Artificial Intelligence.  In addition, the successful prediction of passing the test, although it speaks of the insight of a science fiction writer, does not prove such a quick implementation of a very complex interface. <br><br>  By the 2030s, Kurzweil predicts nanorobots that will help connect the central nervous system to the cloud. <br>  Among the recent domestic works on this subject is the <a href="https://www.google.com/search%3Fclient%3Dfirefox-b-d%26q%3D%25D1%2584%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%2B%25D0%25B8%2B%25D1%2584%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8">work</a> of Fungi and Fengi.  Like a flight to Mars or a return to the moon, which US President Donald Trump described as a <a href="https://itc.ua/news/tramp-rasporyadilsya-vo-chto-byi-to-ni-stalo-otpravit-amerikanskih-astronavtov-na-lunu-do-2024-goda-nasa-iznachalno-planirovala-missiyu-na-2028-god/">task that needs to be solved "by all means"</a> , that is, regardless of timing and financial influences, and the implementation of such technologies sooner or later must happen. <br><br>  Cyborgization, connecting a person to the knowledge base of civilization, a radical extension and improvement of the quality of human life is currently considered the most important task for the largest financial players on the planet. <br><br>  So, it is assumed that robots will be able to connect to our neocortex, forming a bundle with an artificial brain in the cloud. <br>  In general, these nano-organisms can be introduced into the body and managed by them remotely and in real time, making the necessary changes in the biochemistry and morphology of the body. <br><br>  The role of neurons in electrical information processing is reduced to its receipt, integration, synthesis and transfer. <br><br>  Synapses are another fundamental part of an electrochemical system.  These are the central components of neural networks that process information and are involved in the processes of short-term and long-term memory. <br><br>  In addition, the study notes the ability to work not only with electrical signals, but also with the magnetic fields of the brain. <br><br>  Information that goes through the interface to the brain connects it with supercomputers in real time. <br><br>  The protocol for applying the interface should provide for regular testing of connection strength. <br><br>  It is assumed that the most reliable and safe to introduce neuronanal robots intravenously. <br><br>  The characteristics of the system that scientists plan to create are impressive.  Designing such an invention implies that scientists will take into account the parameters of balancing size, power and recording in this design.  The main goals of the design in this case are reducing power consumption, thermal protection, reducing the size of devices and taking data processing to a powerful cloud. <br>  And although today the results of experiments are not so impressive as they are encouraging, science has already managed to interact with the brain of mice and monkeys.  Animals were able to manipulate the power of thought and contact objects in three planes and cooperate with each other. <br><br>  It is predicted that a stable and broad connection will provide 5G. <br><br>  This breakthrough will also help make the global super-mind that connects the best minds of the human species with the computing power of computers. <br><br>  We can learn faster, get smarter and live longer.  Training will be similar to the realization of the dreams of each student - uploaded knowledge, skills and abilities - and passed the exam. <br><br>  The enormous possibilities are represented by the virtual and augmented reality that will become possible with the B / CI interface. <br>  Companies such as Cisco have already reported significant cost savings due to meetings implemented by V and AR (virtual and augmented reality), in particular, the company uses new, realistic telecom presence technology. <br><br>  Kurzweil's predictions have been criticized several times.  In particular, he criticized the forecasts of futurologist Jacques Fresco, philosopher Colin McGinn and computer scientist Douglas Hofshtadter (Douglas Hofstadter). <br><br>  Skeptics suggest that modern science is still too far from the actual implementation of such interfaces.  The maximum that is currently available to science is a brain scan using MRI and to determine which areas are involved in a particular process. <br><br>  Critics express perplexity at the current level of development of science and technology and doubt that for the implementation of such projects it will be enough for two decades even in the conditions of the leading economies of the world.  In addition, there are ideological and religious disputes about the permissibility of such cyborgization.  Time will tell whose predictions come true. <br><br>  Despite the scale of analytical work and experiments on managing, for example, the mouse cursor when using modern technologies for integrating technology with the human brain, such forecasts are often an attempt to get money from investors. <br><br>  In any case, the subject is in the air and is of interest for investment, regardless of the timing of implementation. <br><br>  While scientists are developing nanorobots, we have already prepared a <a href="https://www.cloud4y.ru/cloud-hosting/">secure IaaS infrastructure</a> <s>to transfer your consciousness into it</s> , which you can use for the more mundane goals of today's business. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/448728/">https://habr.com/ru/post/448728/</a></p>
