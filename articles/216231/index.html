It is worth recalling that the journalist Newsweek, in her <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/214903/">publication of March 6,</a> claimed to reveal the identity of the mysterious creator of cryptocurrency Bitcoin. <br><br>  According to the journalist, this creator is Dorian Nakamoto, who lives in California, USA, and owns all the necessary skills and abilities to create a Bitcoin system.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  At the same time, Dorian Nakamoto himself (he had previously changed the name Satoshi to Dorian) denies any involvement in Bitcoin.  Nakamoto claims that he heard about the cryptocurrency itself for the first time from a journalist, on the very day she knocked on the door of his house. <br><br>  Among other things, Nakamoto claims that he can program, but knows nothing about cryptography, p2p systems and alternative electronic payment systems.  But the creator of Bitcoin should have significant knowledge about all three areas. <br><br>  One of the evidence that Dorian Nakamoto is the creator of cryptocurrency Newsweek journalist considered a long "gap" in Nakamoto's professional career.  She believed that this ‚Äúgap‚Äù was evidence that Dorian Nakamoto was doing some kind of secret work for the United States, and therefore nothing was known about this period of his career. <br><br>  However, Dorian himself says that all this is explained very simply: for a long time he could not find work in his specialty, therefore he worked as a laborer and an assistant teacher. <br><br>  In addition, his income has recently declined sharply, and last year he even had to refuse to connect to the Network.  But everyone believes that the creator of Bitcoin cryptocurrency literally "sits on millions", because at the very beginning a very large number of Bitcoins were namned. <br><br>  Nakamoto also appealed to journalists to respect his right to privacy, and leave him and his family alone.  At the end of his address, Dorian Nakamoto thanked everyone for their support, both moral and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/215253/">material</a> . <br><br>  In general, it seems that Dorian Nakamoto either hides his involvement in Bitcoins very well (and who will advertise this?), Or he really is not the creator, and journalists will have to run a lot to reveal the real identity of the creator of cryptocurrency.  Of course, if this person exists in reality, and is not a whole team of professionals, according to some experts. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/17/5517732/dorian-nakamoto-issues-statement-denying-he-invented-bitcoin">theverge</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/216231/">https://habr.com/ru/post/216231/</a></p>
