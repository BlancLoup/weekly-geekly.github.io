Outline </h4><br>  In the spring of 2013, my partner came to me with burning eyes and offered to create a Skype killer.  A prerequisite for such a decision was a pause after the sluggish business was closed, as well as the fact that the Canadian government announced the Canada Start-up Visa program. <br><br>  No sooner said than done.

      Over the next 2 months, MVP was created.  My partner began sending a presentation to Canadian business accelerators. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Vancouver accelerator responded one of the first, began a long month of negotiations, product scrapping, demonstrations. <br><br>  Mid September 2013 - hello, Vancouver. <br><br><h4>  Startup Visa </h4><br>  What you need: <br>  In order to be able to apply for a visa, a business (startup) must meet the main conditions: <br>  - $ 200K from venture capital fund <br>  or <br>  - $ 75K from Angel Investor <br>  or <br>  - the passage of a business incubator <br><br>  Passing the language proficiency exam.  Having money to stay in Canada.  Higher education. <br><br>  At the time of our arrival, the third opportunity was only planned, so we were determined to receive investments. <br><br><h4>  3. Training in a business incubator </h4><br>  In fact, this is a business school where you are focused on working on your project. <br><br>  Training in an incubator made it possible to understand how to conduct business in North America correctly, how to look for and talk to investors. <br>  This experience is perfectly applicable to create a business anywhere in the world. <br><br>  Many may wonder - is it worth it to give up part of the business in order to get into the incubator?  My answer is worth it.  At least the first time definitely worth it.  Training in the incubator gives the necessary understanding of the market, and also, which is important - dating. <br><br><h4>  4. Result </h4><br>  Do not give the word visa in the phrase Start-up visa program to mislead you.  You and your family will receive the most real permanent residence status. <br><br>  Within a year from the moment we thought we were able to get a startup visa (permanent residence) for us and our families.  We became the first team to receive a visa for this program, with which the Minister of Immigration of Canada congratulated us. <br>  We spent more than 9 months in Vancouver - one of the most beautiful cities in the world. <br>  Signed a contract and successfully develop the project further. <br>  We have the opportunity to develop further and be open to new projects and proposals, being here in Vancouver. <br><br><h4>  5. Instead of an epilogue </h4><br>  My lifestyle is quite complex from a moral point of view, especially when you have a family and a child.  The enormous responsibility and the need to control a huge number of processes, both in the family and at work, leave their mark.  I can safely say that last year I lived like in 3 years. <br><br>  The main rule - never give up, do not stop and work, work and work again. <br><br>  I am happy to answer questions. <br><br>  PS The essence of the post - not propiaritsya, and open the field for discussion. <br>  The theme is broad and voluminous ... <br>  - someone is interested in the process of creating a company or MVP necessary for the accelerator; <br>  - someone is interested only in the process of submitting documents and processing an application; <br>  - someone wants to know more about the details of the passage of the accelerator. <br><br>  I am ready to discuss these topics separately. <br><br>  UPD <br><br><h4>  1. Financial issue </h4><br>  The amount must be confirmed at the time of submission of documents in the form of an extract from the bank. <br>  Really take the money as much as you plan to spend on yourself. <br>  Note that the accelerator check can be given with a certain delay, so at least rent for the first time and food for 2-3 weeks will be at your own expense. <br>  Bank, if the company is fresh, the first check holds on the hold for at least 10 working days. <br>  Consider that the money from the accelerator goes to the account of your company, and just because it is difficult to get them from there.  It is necessary to write off on expenses. <br><br>  According to finance requirements: <br><br>  1 person - $ 11,824 <br>  2 - $ 14,720 <br>  3 - $ 18,097 <br><br>  In this case, meaning the family members who are served with the main applicant.  In my case, I filed documents for myself, my wife and daughter. <br><br>  Regarding insurance and other related expenses. <br>  Accelerator gives money, how a startup manages them - his business. <br>  Apart from money, they usually give away so-called perks (all sorts of bonuses and vouchers for using Amazon, azure, trackers, collaboration systems, etc.) <br>  Also allocated jobs in the coworking office. <br>  Well, actually the very training and advice. <br><br>  Everything else - accommodation, food, travel, medical expenses and insurance - as usual lie on the startup. <br><br><h4>  2. Education Requirement </h4><br>  It was determined that the requirements clearly state one year of post-school education and provide good grades. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/236783/">https://habr.com/ru/post/236783/</a></p>
