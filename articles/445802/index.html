It might seem to you that this term has recently begun to sound less often - this is a sign that the phenomenon is moving from the state of "HYIP" to the state of "ordinary". <br><br>  It is safe to say that in the near future, most of the devices we use - cars, televisions, watches, kitchen appliances - all will connect to the network and will be able to interact with each other.  The same thing happens in production: machines and robots are becoming smarter and also connect to the network, generating data, work with which increases efficiency and opens the way to the implementation of such approaches as preventive maintenance based on forecasts.  In total, it is predicted that by the end of 2019 the number of connected ‚Äúthings‚Äù around the world will reach about 26 billion.

      Below are five predictions about how this will happen over the next 12 months, and how we will get used to the fact that the Internet is not only what we connect our computers and smartphones to, but practically everything that we can imagine . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  1. Business will become more serious about IoT </h3><br>  According to Forrester's research, the main role in the rapid growth of IoT is assigned to business: 85% of companies are already implementing or planning to introduce the technology of the Internet of Things this year. <br>  The Internet of Things brings a number of advantages to business.  In previous years, we have already seen several successful experiments, for example, in the retail sector, special devices have appeared that interact with buyers ‚Äôsmartphones and allow to reflect detailed information about a product on their screens.  However, the driving force behind the introduction of IoT is the manufacturing sector.  Here, during 2019, more and more enterprises will see the benefits of connecting equipment to the network, which will allow receiving data on the status and performance parameters of almost every detail and share this data with other devices.  Preventive maintenance of equipment based on forecasts has long been predicted by technology evangelists, but at present it is implemented only by the largest companies that have invested heavily in the development of IoT over several years.  But their experience increases the understanding of how useful and beneficial such solutions can be, so smaller organizations are also expected to take these technologies on board, being confident that the investment will definitely pay for itself. <br><br><h3>  2. Devices will become more vocal. </h3><br>  Just as the usual Internet has given us a voice, IoT will give a voice to all the devices that we use.  We are gradually getting used to using voice control by assistants such as Alexa from Amazon or Siri from Apple.  But 2019 will be the year when all our other devices will find their own voice interface: almost every automaker is working on their own voice assistant to help drivers more comfortably and safely drive a car.  Voice control with natural voice feedback should also be made available to industrial and corporate technologies. <br>  Voice control makes sense in many situations, because it allows you to keep your hands free to perform those operations that still require them, and also removes some of the load from our eyes, which can now focus on more important things.  This method of communication with the machine also removes a number of barriers in the interaction.  Initially, humanity used computer code to send commands to devices, then user interfaces, graphical environments, and other tools appeared that lowered barriers to entry.  Recognizing and generating voice is the logical next step to creating technologies that everyone can use to work more efficiently or improve their lives. <br><br><h3>  3. More and more calculations are done locally. </h3><br>  ‚ÄúEdge computing‚Äù - technologies and algorithms that are different in that calculations are made as close as possible to the data collection point, for example, in sensors or cameras.  The fact is that a huge amount of data collected by such devices are absolutely useless.  A good example is a camera, which in normal mode will transfer terabytes of data to a server, while at least a few megabytes of these records may turn out to be useful in the end, demonstrating suspicious activity. <br>  If such devices are able to perform primary data processing in a certain way instead of thoughtless transferring them to the cloud, data transmission networks will be much less loaded with useless traffic and much more computing power will be occupied by really useful calculations.  In the above example, image recognition algorithms running on the software and hardware of the camera itself will be able to independently analyze the frames for suspicious activity and will transfer only potentially useful data to the server for further processing and storage. <br><br><h3>  4. Artificial intelligence will help with the development and implementation of IoT </h3><br>  Artificial Intelligence (AI, AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) are quite closely related.  IoT contributes to the incredible amount of new data that will appear as a result of its development.  When hundreds and thousands of machines interact with each other in a production network, analyzing large arrays of data obtained in this way, you can get results that human consciousness could never get, especially at the same time, often critical for decision making.  Putting machine learning algorithms to identify various deviations in these data will allow you to see opportunities to increase efficiency or prevent future problems in the early stages. <br>  As the size and complexity of IoT networks increases, they will increasingly depend on new developments in machine learning and AI.  This is also important from the point of view of IoT security, since  There are additional opportunities for automated threat detection. <br><br><h3>  5. 5G networks will expand the scope and availability of IoT </h3><br>  This year we will see the launch of the first consumer networks of the fifth generation, which will be able to work up to 20 times faster than existing mobile data networks.  IoT depends on the speed and availability of data services, and today there are still places to which ‚Äúsmart‚Äù technologies have not yet reached because of the lack of high-quality communication. <br>  With the help of mobile networks that will become faster and more stable than wired analogs, the volume of IoT projects can expand significantly.  Ideas such as the ‚ÄúSmart City‚Äù, where the entire urban infrastructure is integrated into a common network and all data are processed in order to improve the urban environment, are becoming more and more viable.  The technologies used by self-driving cars will also significantly benefit from increased bandwidth. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/445802/">https://habr.com/ru/post/445802/</a></p>
