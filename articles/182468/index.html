  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Launch of Intel Haswell in Russia. The battle for performance continues</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6d4/8e8/d26/6d48e8d263e0d59f527ee00af638095d.jpg"><br>  Yesterday, <b>June 6,</b> official events were held in Moscow, dedicated to the launch of a new generation of <b>Intel Haswell processors</b> in Russia.  And although the event was more of a presentational character (before the appearance of computers on Haswell in the mass market, we will have to wait a little longer), for us it is a good reason to bring together all the interesting information related to the new processors in one post - to make it easier for you to search for it.  Well, we will continue to develop the topic with purely technical reviews and tests. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a0c/7eb/b73/a0c7ebb738d67ae0e8c47630b15fbe68.jpg"><br>  <i>For the first samples of Intel Haswell, serious battles were fought</i> <br><br>  According to Intel's ‚Äútick-one‚Äù strategy, Haswell represents the second iteration stage (‚Äúso‚Äù), when the microarchitecture of the processor is optimized for the technical process that was reduced at the last stage.  It is "those" processors that turn out to be significantly more interesting than their predecessors and get well-deserved market recognition - let us recall, at least, Sandy Bridge.  And here Haswell also did not disappoint. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1c5/d58/751/1c5d58751affded9aeeb5e8d01f312df.jpg"><br>  <i>Further test devices tried to steal a gang of motorcyclists ...</i>

      The first thing that draws attention to Intel, speaking of Haswell - its markedly increased energy efficiency, up to 50% when playing video, about 40% according to the results of universal tests.  And this is not by chance, because the company is aimed at mobile devices, moreover, it seeks to make mobile what is now stationary. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bc4/76b/4f0/bc476b4f08e8b27ed1fc174b152155dc.jpg"><br>  <i>... trying to escape by putting up a smoke screen</i> <br><br>  With the advent of Haswell, the number of hybrid devices will significantly increase - the very ‚Äúultrabooks with a detachable lid,‚Äù which in some quantities still exist on the market.  Now they have all chances to become a mass product, since their consumer qualities have improved significantly.  Pay attention - in the Haswell lineup there is a new class of processors specially designed for tablets, it carries the Y index. This is another groundwork for the ‚Äúmobile future‚Äù, which is now very close. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/615/82c/f81/61582cf815078f33d9df3178b6e653d0.jpg"><br>  <i>Bernadette Andrietti, Intel Marketing Director at EMEA, talks about the hard life of French students who have no place to charge their laptops</i> <br><br>  Second moment.  The fundamentally new Haswell graphics core provides a two-fold performance boost compared to the Ivy Bridge.  Over the years, we have become accustomed to the fact that the integrated graphics are something like office, budget and just in case.  Now is the turning point.  A rather impressive experiment was shown at the presentation: three FullHD monitors were connected to the computer at Haswell, a video clip was spinning on one of them, the second was running the ‚Äútanchiki‚Äù, the third was used for web browsing - while everything lived and did not slow down.  The World of tanks specialist confirmed in his speech: tanks run at maximum settings and have a decent frame rate, even with a margin that allows you to simultaneously record gameplay. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c63/f95/89b/c63f9589b4c40be83ba0203b0675c36b.jpg"><br>  <i>Dmitri <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/terror/" class="user_link">terror</a> Ryzhkov with the help of Mikhail Tsvetkov demonstrates his new application.</i>  <i>The app is desperately resisting.</i> <br><br>  The successes on the graphic front are so impressive that, for the first time in its history, Intel assigned a new name to its own GPU - Iris.  The top GPU model, Iris Pro with its own cache memory, will be equipped with powerful ultrabooks with an eye to the games (well, now the phrase ‚Äúgaming ultrabook‚Äù no longer tears the template).  For less demanding systems, there are solutions that are lower, and I think that in the near future we will see numerous thorough tests of the entire graphic line, and not only the graphic one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f52/985/63d/f5298563d3da627d7ea1484128a77056.jpg"><br>  <i>Still, the Intel Haswell processor was able to save - it is there, under the cooler</i> <br><br>  When will we see all this wealth on the shelves?  Many manufacturers of portable equipment have already presented their products at Haswell - for example, at the Computex 2013 exhibition, which is currently taking place in Taiwan.  Their mass deliveries to Russia will begin in the 3-4 quarter of this year, at the same time the processors will arrive in bulk for installation in a PC, along with motherboards. <br>  We have no doubt that Haswell will be the theme of this summer for the computer industry - and fall, too.  So in the blog, we will return to them more than once. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/182468/">https://habr.com/ru/post/182468/</a></p>
