  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Acronis Man: First lecture at MIPT (with online broadcast)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In our <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/acronis/blog/281533/">previous post,</a> we told the story of Acronis: how it all began more than 10 years ago.  Some people, quite possibly, it seemed impressive, to someone - just interesting, but in reality - this is the story of a company that once rose from simple gray buildings, experienced crisis after crisis with the country after crisis and mastered new markets.  In general, we have long noticed that companies with a special spirit, with a unique drive attract the same people who come, say ‚ÄúThis is mine!‚Äù And remain for many years.  This is <b><a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/ru/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2,_%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">Stanislav Protasov</a></b> , co-founder and head of Acronis development.  By the way, on April 27 (today) Stanislav will deliver an open lecture at his alma mater, at MIPT.  But more on that later. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb1/681/fa1/eb1681fa1d284f6c8454567cdf478ac8.jpg"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#00204D">Came, saw, loved</font> </h2><br>  Initially, Stanislav Protasov acted as an external consultant.  Today he leads all the design and development of Acronis.  He is responsible for his team and, of course, for everything that it creates.  Our company is developing serious data backup systems, and we remember that everyone, pah-pah, a bug in the release can lead to dire consequences.  That is why the team must be not only professional, but well coordinated.  Stanislav builds the work of his R &amp; D team, focusing on achieving the best results.  Therefore, it is timely to identify a weak spot or a strong component in a team and eliminate a disadvantage or take advantage of an advantage is one of its main tasks. <br><br>  Many years of experience in managing the development team did not go unnoticed by the expert community: in 2015, Stas entered the top three CIOs in Russia in the Top 1000 Russian Managers Rating of the Managers Association and Kommersant Publishing House.  He is the author of container technology that underlies the products of leading IT companies, and also owns more than 70 patents in the IT industry.  As an architect and developer at Solomon Software, he received personal praise from Bill Gates for the Cassandra product architecture.  And, among other things, Stanislav is a Candidate of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, a co-founder of Parallels, a co-founder and head of development of Acronis.

      It is quite obvious that such a person has something to tell about. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#00204D">And he will tell</font> </h2><br>  On April 27, at 18:30 Moscow time, Stas Protasov will give an open lecture for the first time in the walls of alma mater - Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology.  At the meeting, Stanislav will talk about his student years at the legendary Phystech and the knowledge acquired during training, which help the Chief Technical Officer of an international IT company. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#00204D">... about learning ...</font> </h2><br>  Unfortunately, more and more often populist ideas are heard that studying at a university takes 5-6 years and does not bring any practical benefit.  An example is Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, who left their universities.  Think about it, whether there really is a number of unrecognized geniuses, or there is a wonderful excuse for the lazy.  But for some reason no one remembers Sergey Brin and Larry Page, who not only brilliantly graduated from the university, but also continuously engaged in scientific research.  Although it seemed, why is it necessary for the founders of Google? <br><br>  A university, like a postgraduate education, teaches how to correctly perceive information, think in a structured way and, most importantly, obtain a base - the foundation on which practical skills are built.  Take, for example, the same development: you can learn a programming language, understand patterns and algorithms, and even create successful applications.  But as soon as it is discussed, for example, about the organization of databases and the development of corporate and high-loaded systems, a theory will be needed immediately.  Of course, Google will help out, but without understanding the insides, the use of pieces of code will lead the developer to a standstill.  Well, and certainly nowhere without deep theoretical knowledge, if you chose your way to Big Data and Data Mining, these are very high-tech areas of development.  Although ... we are sure that Stas will find much more correct arguments. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#00204D">... about IT trends ... or the next big thing</font> </h2><br>  Also Stanislav Protasov will tell about the most important for today - about global IT trends that will change our life in the future.  Stas‚Äôs experience in development and design allows him to be partly a visionary - and competently evaluate promising technologies.  Why do students need it?  Everything is simple - even while studying it is necessary to think about which technologies you need to dive in order to be in trend and become a competitive specialist right after the student's bench.  If you dwell on the curriculum, then at the end of the university it will take several more years to master technologies that meet the needs of the market.  Meanwhile, almost nothing prevents you from doing your own project, working with open source, sharpening your skills and developing your portfolio, which will be your ticket to the future in a large development industry.  Of course, with a pleasant financial reward. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#00204D">... and not only students!</font> </h2><br>  Let us open a little secret: we, of course, know that Stas‚Äôs lecture will be interesting not only to students, but to everyone involved in the IT industry: from HR managers to technical directors.  First of all, because it is an invaluable experience gained over years of practical work.  And practice always distinguishes concreteness in judgments, a professional approach and the desire to share skills.  Such lectures are powerful motivators that help to go beyond the limits of templates, slap yourself on the forehead with the words ‚ÄúAs I still haven‚Äôt thought of, this is another level!‚Äù And go to realize it from a different angle.  We have the opportunity to communicate with Stas every day - everything happens that way :-) <br><br>  The broadcast will take place on the ‚Äú <a href="https://tproger.ru/events/acronis-open-talk-mipt/">Typical Programmer</a> ‚Äù community channel: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/AJJieUjhY6o%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjaPVY4CIpU3ohViR7MOudwjy4KrQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Write yourself in the calendar for today, April 27, 6:30 pm - you definitely will not regret. <br><br>  If you are in Moscow, the Moscow region and want to chat with Stas, personally ask him questions, then register for full-time participation <a href="http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/2702987/27-2016">here</a> .  For personal participation registration is strictly required.  By the way, at the end of the meeting we will raffle among our guests the popular Apple Watch and a few memorable gifts.  Do not forget to <a href="http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/2702987/27-2016%2520">register</a> and fill out a short business card at the entrance. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#00204D">Uncover intelligence!</font> </h2><br>  In the meantime, the evening has not come, we offer you to solve interesting problems and write your answers in the comments.  We will find the most intelligent, proactive and resourceful than to please. <br><br>  So, dear experts, the question is asked by Acronis. <br>  Attention, question! <br><br>  <b><font color="#00204D">"</font> Question 1:</b> In America, the original program was written, which, in case of pressing several keys simultaneously, includes blocking any running program and makes a loud sound.  What was this program written for? <br><br>  <b><font color="#00204D">"</font> Question 2:</b> In an old computer game, three Vikings were abducted from their settlement by aliens and hit a flying saucer.  In order to be saved, the kidnapped had to destroy the ship‚Äôs computer.  Having heard the mission, one of the Vikings says: ‚ÄúFirstly, this is not a ship, and secondly ...‚Äù Finish his sentence. <br><br>  <b><font color="#00204D">"</font> Question 3:</b> As you probably know, the Turing test is a procedure in which a computer must try to convince a person that he is also a person.  It is unlikely that you took part in such a test, but most likely passed another test, the full name of which also contains the Turing name.  What is this test? <br><br>  Time has gone :-) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/282608/">https://habr.com/ru/post/282608/</a></p>
