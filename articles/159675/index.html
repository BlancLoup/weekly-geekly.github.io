That is why in our computational nodes we use only high-performance processors.  Now it is Intel Xeon with a frequency of 3.07GHz and higher. <br><br>  In the near future, after all the final tests are completed, we will launch a new pool on the latest Intel Xeon E5 processors, which are ~ 50% faster than previous generation processors. <br><br>  Transition to new generation processors will allow to get much more efficient work with memory.  Now it will be 4-channel memory, which is almost 2 times faster than the previous one. <br><br>  And we are testing a cluster on Opterons and are looking forward to new stones.  Such systems will allow you to get up to 64 processor cores within one virtual machine!  Hold on tight!  =) <br><br>  <b>Circulatory system: Discs and Vehicles</b> <br><br>  Obviously, no matter how super-fast processors and memory are, without a sufficiently productive disk system, this will absolutely not matter.  Therefore, we approached the creation of disk storage with special attention.  It is based on high-performance controllers, 15k SAS disks and SSD disks for caching. <br><br>  We took the best as a transport for the storage system - InfiniBand from Mellanox. <br><br>  Thus, we managed to achieve maximum performance and, importantly, reliable operation of the disk system. <br><br>  And we also have plans in the near future - launching a pool of SSD disks for our VDS servers.  Ready to be surprised?  =) <br><br>  <b>VDS Brain: VDS Special Control Panel</b> <br><br>  We are proud of all our own developments, and the VDS control panel is our special pride! <br>  Armed with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãminimalism during the design of the system, we fought for every pixel and we did great! <br><br>  The working interface of the control panel consists of 3 main parts: <br><br><ul><li>  header with features common to the account; </li><li>  list of virtual servers; </li><li>  central panel VDS, containing the main functionality. </li></ul><br><br>  It is this separation that made the panel more convenient and easy to use. <br><br>  In addition, on the VDS main page, we should immediately see all the most important information: a summary of the system, payment data and basic parameters of the virtual server. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4eb/f74/0c8/4ebf740c816830e97c237e1064bd752d.jpg"><br><br>  Server configuration setting should be as convenient and understandable as possible. <br><br>  Our task was not just to give the opportunity to configure the server, but to make this action as clear and convenient as possible.  As a result, the entire setting is placed on one screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/979/d91/24f/979d9124f1cc1dd4d761ca4e036baa15.jpg"><br><br>  The main unit of the control panel is a virtual server. <br><br>  That is why we combined important entities: balance, domains, snapshots from the server, and not associated them with the whole account.  This makes the work always clear, everything is in its place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/998/84b/a03/99884ba0331a27b65e8fe2a0ac521317.jpg"><br><br>  We provide full DNS management, including management of A, AAAA, MX, SRV, TXT, PTR records.  Management capabilities are the same as on our shared hosting.  In this case, the records on all our DNS servers are updated in the same second, in which you click "Save" (our DNS server operation scheme, which supports more than 400 thousand records and updates information in a split second, is the topic of a separate article). <br><br>  Even more interesting features inside - <a title="VDS server TIMEWEB!" href="http://timeweb.ru/services/vds/">try our VDS</a> on the test period. <br><br>  <b>To infinity and beyond!</b> <br><br>  During the last 6 months we have done a great job in creating and testing our VDS hosting and we will be happy if you use the free test period and evaluate its work. <br><br>  We have many plans for the development of VDS ahead.  Virtualization is a very powerful engine of information technology. <br><br>  We are glad that together with you we open the door to the future.
