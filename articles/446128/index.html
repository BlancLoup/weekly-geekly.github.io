Released records ‚Äúon the bones‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Massive Attack, J√≥nsi from Sigur Ros, Noam Chomsky, Pussy Riot and others recorded radiographs with unreleased compositions as part of a joint project of the University of the Underground, the Bureau of Lost Culture and the Museum of Digital Collectors ( Digital museum Collecteurs).  The project aims to counter censorship and support pluralism of opinions.  The records are planned to be sold at auction, the profit from which will be directed to the development of the project ‚ÄúUnderground University‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rt/xq/ao/rtxqaosjfk1ij6bvjpzowooovmk.jpeg"><br><br>  X-ray phonograms or otherwise ‚Äúbone music‚Äù became widespread in the USSR from the late 1940s to the mid-1960s.  The records were made by artisanal method due to the rigid musical censorship, which did not allow a large number of performers, groups and even entire styles to be published.  Under the cut, I will tell you more about how the music appeared on the bones and about the modern project, symbolically reviving the archaic technology. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h3>  Rib Music and Censorship in the USSR </h3><br>  From the mid-30s to the mid-80s, an unprecedented censorship was in effect in the Soviet Union regarding certain musical styles that were popular in the West.  First, formalistic trends in academic music were banned, then jazz, foxtrot, and later the same fate befell the appeared rock and roll and the overwhelming majority of its derivatives. <br><br>  Thanks to the trophies exported from Germany and liberated after the German occupation of the country, some Soviet citizens were able to get closer to Western music.  This contributed to the fact that after the end of the Second World War in Soviet society there was a need for alternatives to ideologically sterile, and therefore quite monotonous Soviet art.  Jazz and foxtrot became such an alternative. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/io/kv/tq/iokvtqvuw27jabl-n2b0ydqz3a0.jpeg"><br><br>  Western music was often considered the Soviet leadership alien, harmful, decadent cultural influence, and, accordingly, fell under various prohibitions and restrictions.  This was the cause of strict censorship bans on the publication of records of almost all existing jazz styles, and later bans on the performance and publication of rock music.  The society‚Äôs response to these limitations was the self-publishing of bone plates. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gi/zc/cb/gizccbpmnokniudyusoz_o5vz2y.jpeg"><br><br>  For the publication, the sale of ‚Äúmusic on the ribs‚Äù, as well as for the storage of radiographs with ideologically incorrect music were punished, incl.  imprisonment.  There is a popular myth about the existence of an article for ‚Äúworshiping the West,‚Äù but in reality such an article did not exist in the Criminal Code of the RSFSR.  The sale of ‚Äúundesirable‚Äù records was punished more often as speculation (until 1960, Art. 107, after 1960 - 154 of the Criminal Code of the RSFSR and similar articles in the Criminal Code of the Union republics). <br><br>  Until 1960, the plate dealer had been lighted from 5 years in the camps, with partial or full confiscation of property.  In the Criminal Code of the RSFSR of the 60th year, a wider range of penalties was provided, where a banal monetary penalty (from 300 rubles), correctional work, and imprisonment from 3 to 7 years could be applied to the distributor of rentgenizdat. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dk/-b/w9/dk-bw9m40yynbzxarj_xpu_tm5a.jpeg"></div><br><br>  Formally, storing, listening and even writing on the bones was not punishable.  But in fact for the last, as well as for the sale, could apply article 58, for example, 58.17 <blockquote>  ‚ÄúProduction, storage for the purpose of distribution and distribution of agitational literature of a counter-revolutionary nature‚Äù </blockquote>  that was punishable by imprisonment for at least one year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fq/py/2p/fqpy2prek5gsamp27it509boo60.jpeg"><br><br>  The production of the discs was carried out using a handicraft recorder; X-rays based on cellulose diacetate were used.  The recorder copied the recording from the original record, cutting the tracks on the film.  The recording quality left much to be desired, but before the mass distribution of tape recorders, this was the only way to replicate prohibited content. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hw/mw/nt/hwmwntaqatinofw_lulczgawbjq.jpeg"><br><br>  Over time, such records had the ability to curl, and therefore they were tried to be stored in one envelope along with standard vinyl discs.  Thus, Bill Haley‚Äôs ‚ÄúRock around the Clock‚Äù could peacefully coexist with the speeches of V.I.  Lenin. <br><br><h3>  More about the project </h3><br>  Currently, Massive Attack, frontman Sigur R√≥s Yonci, Russian protest group Pussy Riot, as well as N√°stio Mosquito, Alex Somers (Alex Somers) and Neil Harbisson are participating in the project.  Each published disc is an x-ray image that contains one of the unreleased tracks of project participants, an auction <a href="https://underground.collecteursmagazine.com/">is available online</a> , and you need to donate $ 1 to access the auction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dw/jw/-g/dwjw-gwobylrahfb9rwru-fbls0.jpeg"><br><br>  It is impossible to know in advance exactly which tracks were in the collection.  To warm the interest, the project participants posted the inscription: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThis is one of‚Ä¶ to be archived at the Library of Dangerous Thoughts‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis is one of (the number is indicated for a specific artist - Note by the author) of original works, which will be archived in the library of dangerous thoughts‚Äù </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dq/ao/qt/dqaoqtxn2d-vzxwjxdmee_zga5y.png"><br><br>  Circulations are strictly limited, under some snapshots with records there are inscriptions indicating that they are unique.  At the time of this writing, March 31, 2019, the cost of the most sought-after lots comes to $ 400.  The most popular, expectedly, became ‚Äúbones‚Äù from Massive Attack.  9 out of 10 X-ray phonograms exist in a single copy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ej/v9/ct/ejv9ct02ufazsfool550i5hb1mo.jpeg"><br><br>  It is also interesting that the authors of the project recommend using the acquired radiographs not to listen to recorded tracks, but as works of art.  They write directly that they do not guarantee the normal reproduction of music on the bones more than five times. <br><br><h3>  Total </h3><br>  The project has already attracted media attention, so it is highly probable that some of the pictures with records will be bought fairly quickly and at a fairly high price (21 days left until the end of the auction).  The excitement stirs the uniqueness of the recordings and the fame of the performers.  Proponents of high fidelity playback, wishing to hear these tracks, recorded not in the pictures, it is hoped that the musicians will publish these recordings in a different format. <br><br>  <i>Jeans</i> <i><br></i>  <i>In our <a href="https://www.pult.ru/">catalog</a> there is no music on the bones, but there are traditional <a href="https://www.pult.ru/product/proigryvateli-vinilovyh-diskov/vinilovye-plastinki/">vinyl records</a> , as well as equipment for their playback and much more.</i> <br><br>  <i>Photo content used:</i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="http://amnesia.pavelbers.com/">amnesia.pavelbers.com</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="https://culttrigger.media/">culttrigger.media</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="https://www.whathifi.com/">www.whathifi.com</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="http://traumawien.at/stuff/more/bone-music">traumawien.at/stuff/more/bone-music</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="https://cameralabs.org/">cameralabs.org</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="https://raasta.livejournal.com/">raasta.livejournal.com</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="https://news.avclub.com/">news.avclub.com</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="https://starina.ru/">starina.ru</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="http://victorprofessor.livejournal.com/">victorprofessor.livejournal.com</a> (probably <a href="https://victorborisov.livejournal.com/">victorborisov.livejournal.com</a> )</i> <i><br></i>  <i>If you are against the use of photo content that belongs to you, let us know and we will replace it.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/446128/">https://habr.com/ru/post/446128/</a></p>
