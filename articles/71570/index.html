Who!  Ministries, departments, simply officials under the sauce is not ready infrastructure.  Of course, if IT tenders do not solve specific tasks, but serve to cut a dough, the infrastructure will never be ready.  Now the texture. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><blockquote>  MOSCOW, October 5th.  / Prime-Tass /.  The Ministry of Communications and Mass Media of Russia advocates that the law ‚ÄúOn Personal Data‚Äù enters into force, as planned, from January 1, 2010, ensuring real protection of information about the private life of Russians.  This was announced today by the Deputy Minister of Communications and Mass Communications Alexei Soldatov. In an interview with ITAR-TASS, he commented on a letter from human rights activists who applied to the head of the RF Ministry of Communications and Mass Media Igor Schegolev with a call not to allow "further postponements of the law coming into force." <br><br>  According to the deputy minister, ‚Äúsimilar laws have been successfully working in Europe for a long time.  Of course, enterprises will have to work hard to create personal data protection systems that meet the requirements of this law. ‚Äù  In turn, the ministry is ready to provide personal data operators with all the necessary information support.

      ‚ÄúThe lack of regulation of access to personal data is a fairly obvious factor in official abuse and other forms of corruption,‚Äù said Dmitry Itskovich, one of the authors of an appeal to the minister, director of the United Humanitarian Publishing House.  At the same time, human rights activists fear that if the database can be illegally copied and sold entirely, then nothing will prevent access to its parts - the data on a specific person or company in order to illegally influence them. </blockquote><br><br>  Hello to the thieves of the bases of GAI and all the other good that can be bought not very expensive in the market.  It turns out that, according to the "new" law, the leadership that does not ensure the safety of the data will sit.  But they do not want to sit.  At the same time, hello lovers punch through the base using their official position. <br><br><blockquote>  At the same time, the problem of unavailability of the part of social institutions working in the conditions of an undeveloped communication infrastructure to the entry into force of this law ‚Äútelecommunications operators‚Äù offer to soften without delay in its entry into force.  According to the ministry, it is now important to prepare explanatory guidelines, primarily regarding the technology of storing personal data in schools, hospitals and clinics.  Such recommendations, explained A. Soldatov, are already being developed by the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media together with the Ministry of Education and Science and the Ministry of Health and Social Development. <br><br>  The law, signed by the President of the Russian Federation on July 28, 2006, is aimed at the realization of the constitutional rights of Russians to privacy and freedom of information, as well as the international obligations of the Russian Federation to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Individuals in the automated processing of personal data.  From the moment the law comes into force, the personal data of Russians can be collected and processed only with their knowledge.  It also provides for the creation of a special agency for the protection of the rights of personal data subjects, which should be authorized to register their information systems. </blockquote><br><br>  Let's hope that a good law, in fact, will somehow work, and it will be unclear who will not read your data.
