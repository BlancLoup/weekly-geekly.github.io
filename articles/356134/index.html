Milonov (pictured), noted the depressing fact that Russia now lacks legislative regulation of activities in social networks, and it must be by all means: ‚ÄúA social network is a special virtual world in which a person spends significant part of his life, comes into contact with other people, and, in fact, performs all the same actions as in the real world.  We must not allow this sphere to remain outside the law. ‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The author of the bill highlights two problems that are associated with excessive use of social networks by adolescents: <br><br><ul><li>  Suicide promotion </li><li>  The corrupting influence of "difficult" teenagers on their peers </li></ul><br>  In order to prevent and combat such phenomena, the author of the bill proposes <b>to prohibit the use of social networks to persons under the age of 14 years</b> .  And ‚Äúin order to eradicate the feeling of impunity‚Äù, it is proposed to <b>legislatively fix the registration procedure of the social network user</b> .  In particular, for registration it is required to present an identity card in electronic form.

      The need to provide passport data, the author of the bill believes, will also solve the problem of ‚Äúfake pages‚Äù when a person registers under a different name and compromises the person who allegedly owns the page. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAnother problem block that is affected by this bill is the organization of unauthorized meetings using social networks,‚Äù the explanatory note said.  - The organizers of such events are found through social networks of citizens who are ready to participate in an illegal campaign for a certain amount.  In the social network to do it quite simple.  In this regard, it is proposed to tighten administrative responsibility for organizing unauthorized meetings through social networks. ‚Äù <br><br>  The draft law establishes a single procedure for registering users of social networks, their basic rights and obligations.  One user is not allowed several pages in one social network.  For providing the user with false personal data or failure to report changes in their personal data - a fine of up to 3,000 rubles.  If a user under 18 years of age joins a community where information about rallies or other information that is prohibited for distribution to children is distributed, the fine is up to 2,000 rubles.  The presence of several pages in the social network - a fine of up to 5000 rubles.  Assigning the owner of a social network to a user of several pages in a social network - a fine of up to 300 thousand rubles.  The same penalty for registering a user who did not provide his personal data.  Repeated violation - a fine of up to 500 thousand rubles.  or correctional work up to 100 hours. <br><br>  Among other things, V.V.Milonov proposes to prohibit the sale of goods through social networks to users under the age of 18 (a fine of up to 30 thousand rubles). <br><br>  The bill establishes certain rules for viewing files, videos and photos of other users, posting comments, exchanging messages, and reposting. <br><br>  Control measures to verify the implementation of the provisions of the law impose on Roskomnadzor.  In addition, an interdepartmental coordinating body to monitor the implementation of activities in social networks will be created. <br><br>  PS It is difficult to imagine that such a ‚Äúdraconian‚Äù bill can be approved by the State Duma. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/356134/">https://habr.com/ru/post/356134/</a></p>
