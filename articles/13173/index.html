I, like any user, can not tolerate spam and always there is a desire to kill the one who sends it (spam).  This is a normal feeling and it visits each user when he sees in his mail a sentence on "Penis Enlargement" or "Cheap Viagra." <br>  But that spam was special.  The proposal itself was kind of idiotic.  From the category of buy cheaper from them in bulk and sell in parts, but more expensive.  But what I liked was a phrase that sounded like this: ‚ÄúLet the best 100 people earn you $ 1 than you will work for $ 100‚Äù. <br>  Something in this phrase is clinging.  This is actually a classic <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3">network marketing</a> .  I somehow paid little attention to this kind of marketing that I now regret it.  In fact, I, like most people who were thrown in the 90s, associate network marketing with pyramids, herbalife and sects.  Although these organizations use network marketing in their affairs, however, they are not network marketing in its general concept. <br>  In general, network marketing is the promotion of your product or services through third parties.  That is, it is not salespeople who work in your organization, but friends from all the rings of your ‚Äú <a href="http://z.codeby.net/2007/07/08/socialnaya-set-put-k-vashemu-uspexu/">social network</a> ‚Äù. <br>  Network marketing is good because you don‚Äôt need to invest in advertising.  All your actions should be targeted and targeted.  Here a great role is played by the competent structure of rewards, rewards and training of new adherents.  And he is just perfect because you receive money even when you retire and are not joking in the development of your network.  The network works for you! <br>  Everyone knows about <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amway">Amway</a> , but no one has ever seen its advertising on TV.  Although this company is scolded by all and sundry, but I still order products from it and am very pleased with their quality.  My acquaintance supplier delivers me various products at discount prices and I am very pleased with her, unlike the fakes of the same <a href="http://www.pg.com/en_US/gillette/index.jhtml">Gillette</a> on the market. <br>  Let's think about how to make money out of everything said.  Making money is not difficult and not easy.  I will explain why.  It‚Äôs usually easier to sell your product directly because you control the flow of sales yourself and can influence them.  At the initial stage of the business is very important.  But your income here depends on how much you work, so much you get. <br>  Roughly speaking, if you are selling software, then as long as you sell - you are afloat and have an income, as soon as you stop selling - your business starts to "fade out". <br>  Then you ‚Äúscratch the turnip‚Äù and understand that it would be nice to attract affiliates who would distribute your software for work.  And here comes the era of network marketing.  You sell the program at $ 19.95, but you receive from it, taking into account the commissions, not $ 17, as in direct sales, but $ 11, and the remaining $ 6 gets an affiliate. <br>  That is, your profit from one copy is less, but at the expense of turnover, you get more profit in general.  There is one more plus.  When you have a well-established dealer network, where almost anyone can become a dealer, you can focus not on sales, but on finalizing the product to the mind and releasing new versions. <br>  Network marketing is the same <a href="http://z.codeby.net/2007/07/15/kak-sozdat-svoyu-socialnuyu-set-prakticheskoe-rukovodstvo/">social networks</a> , but only in the sales plane.  Here, too, have their own circles, there are the same laws by which through 5 chains you can sell your goods to any inhabitant on the planet, and so on. <br>  It turns out working in the sales of your services you, first of all, should look not at the improvement of the product, but at its sales.  And when many familiar people are tied up in sales, you can safely work on quality, and there are buyers. <br>  Say, if you have developed your own CMS, which even by an order of magnitude will be better than the well-known <a href="http://www.bitrix.ru/">Beatrix</a> , then in order to conquer the market with this system, you will have to sweat and not weakly.  Therefore, if you do this on your own, this process can be very long, and if you set up sales, and you are engaged in quality, the market will win by itself. <br>  But why go far.  Look at the same Internet Explorer standoffs with <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/">Firefox</a> and <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a> .  Even with such strong support from the latter, the donkey still ‚Äúdoes‚Äù with a large margin these browsers, which are much superior to IE, well, literally in everything. <br>  It is due to the competent promotion and creation of this network for promotion, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> "has" the whole of Open Source, which is barely breathing and it is unlikely that in the near future it will even be equal to the Small-soft opponent. <br>  You only need to act on the same principle as spies (or scouts, who like what) - build your network!  These people come to foreign territory and they have no one.  Their task is in the shortest possible time to penetrate the top of the enemy and make it as if he is the most devoted friend of the whole ideology of the enemy (did everyone watch?). <br>  So do it, not only for illegal purposes, but in the development of your own business.  You are a scout and your task is to build your own business so that it works even when you retire.  Then your mission will be considered successfully completed. <br>  Of course, creating your own sales network is not as easy as it seems, but nevertheless it will then be rewarded to you and your business. <br>  By the way, there is another type of network marketing - is diversification of activities or niche.  For example, in the West, on the same Ibiza, it is difficult to find 2 similar institutions.  Each institution has its own unique approach in the selection of parties, in the organization of business, in the format of DJs and so on. <br>  Similarly, in the approach to business.  If a company is engaged in construction, and they urgently need to hold a party, then it will never look for any activist Masha (or Mary) from the accounting department who would organize it.  But in Soviet countries, it is pretty often visible.  In the west, they simply hire a club or company that will be engaged in their holiday. <br>  The system of outsourcing works in the same way.  Many software companies or web studios hire freelancers to work.  Even eminent companies like <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/">RBC</a> or <a href="http://www.artlebedev.ru/">Lebedev</a> hire freelancers to work.  Because it gives them a focus on other things, like brand promotion, sales and other non-production related management things. <br>  It turns out such a network, when everyone does his own business, but at the same time everyone is tied up on each other. <br>  Act the same way - create your network and the money will reach out to you (: <br>  <strong><a href="http://z.codeby.net/">Source - Sergey Zhukovsky</a></strong> </div>
