  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Second shift</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The other day the Russian premiere of Intel processors built on the new <b>Sandy Bridge</b> architecture took place.  I have already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/111347/">talked in detail</a> about the model range and about some of the features of their work, but finally the time has come when you can not just feel the new items, but take it as a basis for the new system or buy a laptop based on them. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/116212/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d54/519/a20/d54519a20a7d3c23082d14c18b167656.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The announcement was postponed for a reason - I think you already heard that shortly after the official launch, the company found a <a href="http://newsroom.intel.com/community/intel_newsroom/blog/2011/02/07/intel-provides-update-on-support-chip-design-issue%3Fcid%3Drss-258152-c1-264281">mistake</a> in some batch of chipsets, which was why it was decided to withdraw everything and everything, including the already-made equipment.  So I will calm those who were ‚Äúafraid‚Äù of taking contact with Sandy Bridge - at the moment the error has long been eliminated, production has again begun in full swing, and now it will not work to buy a defective ‚Äústone‚Äù or device with it on board, even if desired.

But against the background of the fact that everyone only speaks about them, interest never ceases to grow.  Although even the company's blog about new processors has been repeatedly written. <br><br>  Let me remind you that the world premiere of the new processors took place at the beginning of the year and for this, Intel prepared a wonderful <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/111262/">video</a> with the brave Eva Moore - I still consider this ad one of the best with the company: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZM0ptMqNhso&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiz5S8DfUl6fGTMb9bC9d-bH-OUjw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  But what was my surprise when the presentation from this video continued in reality - within the walls of the Pushkin cinema, where the Russian premiere of second-generation Intel Core processors took place.  Somersaults, flyaki and rondatas performed by a girl, spectacular waving ... but the contents of the envelope of fate are still unknown) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7fa/1d4/d75/7fa1d4d758b435610d209c35f65df553.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But in the continuation of the blockbuster, new heroes appeared, the first of which was Dmitry Konash, regional director of Intel in Russia and other CIS countries.  He began his presentation with a refutation of the myth that sales of stationary computers stopped growing - if you believe the charts, they at least do not fall :) On the other hand, indeed, as an alternative, users increasingly choose laptops or even netbooks that have enough performance for a very wide range of tasks.  Anyway, the result is the same - the need for processors was, is and will be. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/144/4ee/2f6/1444ee2f6ea845f92c163783db260311.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>‚ÄúThe 2nd generation Intel Core processors are not just another success of our developers,</i> ‚Äù believes Dmitry Konash.  - <i>This is the best of what we have been able to create in the more than 40-year history of the company.</i>  <i>Today, these processors are unmatched.</i>  <i>Therefore, we are confident that not only our industry partners and customers from the business sector, but also ordinary users will appreciate their capabilities</i> . <i>‚Äù</i> <br><br>  There were a lot of partners at the presentation, among them are such familiar manufacturers as Acer, ASUS, iRu, Lenovo, Meijin, MSI, Packard Bell, R-Style, Sony and Toshiba.  Each of the companies presented their new products - the second hero of the blockbuster, Alexey Rogachkov (regional product introduction specialist), consistently performed various user tasks, demonstrating the potential of new processors. <br><br>  For example, the difference in performance of two processors of different generations was visible in the first example - when you needed to apply Imagenomic Portraiture to many photos in Photoshop.  I do not remember the exact numbers of time, but the new processor coped with the task almost twice as fast.  Maybe in real life, these seconds and minutes do not play such a big role, but you see, it‚Äôs nice when the system works more lightly - this was evident from living examples, and not from abstract ‚Äúparrots‚Äù from articles and reviews. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f2b/bfd/820/f2bbfd820010fca60b3171c05f39b042.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Against the background of the tricks of the mysterious special agent Eva Moore, the video from the company <b>Main road | post</b> , which is engaged in the production of computer graphics and special effects for movies, looked no less impressive.  I have seen this video before, but this does not mean that since then the technical side of the question has become simpler - rather, vice versa.  According to Mikhail Lesin, a company representative, the new processors really allow you to do more, and this example clearly shows why high performance is needed: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/vLshT1Yvt_g%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhh4kAMVynxA6dsS_IEMDgLIHbESGA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  We managed to try new processors and the guys from the studio ‚Äú <b>Space of Ideas</b> ‚Äù - Daniel and David Lieberman, doing ‚ÄúCartoon of Personality‚Äù on the first channel.  From the moment they receive the script, they have only a week to create a high-quality 25-minute TV animation.  To solve their problems, they use a second-generation Intel Core server cluster running week after week.  According to them, the test results showed a good increase compared with previous generation Intel Core i7 processors - the rendering time of the standard scene decreased by 18-20%, and the compositing time of the standard scene decreased by 10-15%. <br><br>  I will not put video clips - in the conversation after the speech, they said that they read Habr and would gladly take part in writing some interesting article about the backstage of their activities.  And they, apparently, have something to tell interesting. <br><br>  It was somewhat unusual to see the <s>black lord of</s> StarCraft 2 on the main screen of the Pushkin cinema. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/55d/9b9/7df/55d9b97dfc2b6405d2c9010c7e7f711a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  However, Tom Clancy's HAWX and Mass Effect 2 looked no less unusual - as if the main operator had accidentally output the signal from the wrong source.  But as it turned out, all this was a demonstration of the capabilities of the integrated graphics of new processors! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8fe/52c/5b0/8fe52c5b09b8492e1b0450706c220792.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In Resident Evil 5, the number of FPS was on average 40-60, while the processor of the previous generation (on the neighboring stand) showed a result of only 20-25 frames.  Pleasantly surprised - this means that many SOHO-systems can easily do without expensive ‚Äúadult‚Äù video adapters, while allowing the user to watch high-quality videos and even play toys. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d96/607/26f/d9660726f081819601e5339f974656be.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But the news became different for me - it turns out that if there is a discrete video card in the system, it is not necessary to alternate it with an integrated one - since recently they can be used simultaneously.  By the way, if in 2006, by the current moment, only a tenfold increase in the performance of integrated graphics was predicted, then in reality everything turned out to be much more interesting - the increase was 25-fold! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/da8/c4c/fa0/da8c4cfa018998051f4016ec165591a7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Later there was a series of questions and answers, where particularly curious people tried to find out the fate of one of the processor's legs of the new socket, for example) I was too ashamed to ask my question, so I‚Äôll ask here: well, what, someone has already managed to try the new processor, what are your impressions?  All the same was presented neither more nor less - 29 models, from small to large!  However, I probably ask for nothing in vain - even if someone got a novelty, then most likely the upgrade did not take place from the previous line, but from some ancient series, that is, the difference is visible anyway. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f8f/7a3/1e8/f8f7a31e8d11c451c9183ada140cf78b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After the main performance, there was a minute to talk with companies, to see their new products.  Basically, significant changes have appeared only in the stuffing - that will soon appear on store shelves, you can read in an <a href="http://www.nomobile.ru/texts/110758.html">article</a> on Nomobile.ru.  I exchanged contacts with iRu for the future - in the previous <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/115432/">post I</a> didn‚Äôt expect that there would be such an interest in their devices, so if you want, you can write about something. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a1b/135/16e/a1b13516ef3d75d1a8e13ef72f55208f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Another premi√®re announced at the event was the contest ‚Äú <b><a href="http://www.intel.com/ru_ru/visuallife/index.htm">Lifestyles</a></b> ‚Äù.
