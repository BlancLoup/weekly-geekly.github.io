  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The gamer taking away blood the device removed from Kickstarter</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h3>  Blood Sport campaign was completed early about 13 hours ago </h3><br> <a href="http://https:"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/717/8e1/5a7/7178e15a76254f0c93e69e52e5110cae.png" align="right" width="400"></a>  The most gambling game begins when at stake, at least, is health, and better - the life of the player.  On the latter, the creators of Blood Sport (the name translates as ‚Äú <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0">bloody fun</a> ‚Äù) did not dare, but you can donate blood using their device.  The goal of the project is to gamify the donation and relieve the associated stress.  Usually this procedure involves a tedious wait, during which it is advisable not to faint. <br><br>  It looks like this: wires go from the gamepad to the Arduino board.  The microcontroller controls the operation of the donor blood collection machine.  It is unclear whether the creators are going to replace the Arduino in the final version, or everything will remain as in the working prototype. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Modern game controllers are equipped with vibration motors so that the player can feel the recoil of the weapon or get information about the damage done to the character.  It is from these vibration motors that the signal is taken, so the game is required to use the vibration at strictly certain moments.  There is no need to write any special software for working with the device, to activate the Blood Sport you only need to enable vibration. <br><br>  The system contains a variety of data on the physical condition of the player: weight, age, medical indicators.  Inexperienced, often mistaken players will not faint, the controller remembers how much blood was taken, and at the right time will stop the process of the fence.

It turns out that a player can lose points of life of his real body at the same moments as the character he controls. <br><br>  As the creators hope, such a system will travel through Canada's gaming festivals and attract donor blood. <br><br>  The goal of the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1246820613/blood-sport-the-ultimate-in-immersive-gaming">campaign</a> is to collect 250 thousand Canadian dollars (this is approximately 222 thousand US dollars), a similar amount was partly dictated by the need to transport and the cost of components and medical equipment. <br><br>  The launch is scheduled for March 17, 2015 in Toronto.  Supporting the project financially will not receive the device, since this is a whole system, including complex and expensive medical devices, they will only be offered to try the Blood Sport in action. <br><br>  About 13 hours ago, Kickstarter closed the campaign.  As a rule, no explanation is given, which was the reason, from the leadership of the crowdfunding platform is not given.  There is no answer from the authors of the project yet.  But the reasons are easy to see: donor blood sampling is not a game, but a strict medical procedure. <br><br>  Judging by the speed of recruitment, the project would not have received the necessary amount of funding.  Needless suggests a comparison with the project to create a "real" shooter <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/758646339/blood-guts-n-glory-we-are-bgng">Blood, Guts &amp; Glory</a> , in which players could get real pain impulses in the game.  Despite the outward temptation, his campaign failed. <br><br>  Based on materials from <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/11/24/blood-sport/">Engadget</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/11/22/7268715/blood-sport-kickstarter-video-games">Polygon</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363413/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363413/</a></p>
