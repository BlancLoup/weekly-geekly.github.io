I wrote something to someone, as I noticed that one letter stopped typing on the keyboard.  Well, with age, such artifacts are possible - after all, for the fifth year now I have been continuously using <b>Logitech diNovo Edge</b> , which I still cannot rejoice at.  He took off the button ... and was surprised at the amount of dust that was under it!  Of course, I never ate or drank over the keyboard, but occasionally I even shook and blew it with compressed air ... but this time I decided to take up a great cleaning.

As a result, I realized that all the screws are hidden behind a solid orange plastic sticker that occupies the entire reverse side of the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/70c/c15/a6d/70cc15a6d2b4edd866e6866eec30ee74.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Without thinking twice, I tore off this ‚Äúmeat‚Äù sticker, since  there was no other option.  From that moment on, a terrible smell of glue or something else, very unpleasant for the nose, formed in the room - good, such problems on the balcony are solved by opening the window) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/79c/7ff/f7c/79c7fff7cde40f5cc3365e24834d2e69.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Next, unscrewed a dozen two screws of different caliber - this required a specially <s>trained</s> sharpened screwdriver. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/01b/bae/b3e/01bbaeb3efc58e328a860f8b9cd9f686.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  When all the ‚Äúprotection‚Äù was removed, that fragile electronics appeared in front of me, which was so filled with bloodthirsty tea, beer and cola. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e45/503/d7a/e45503d7a75dac3c665937caad6bd4be.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6a6/578/2fc/6a65782fc8e8a062a31fc8f8d290daed.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I studied a little keyboard structure.  Several separate printed circuit boards with different schemes, a couple of loops - soldering everywhere is very neat and in general everything is done to last.  The battery is the size of a phone, although I always thought that it takes up all the free space in the device.  It is hard to believe, but he still stably holds a month of work on one charge! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/064/ada/c69/064adac69b03a85e9f3b6a5246e9b1b4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7e5/b1c/36e/7e5b1c36edfaa3f11a2ecef39a87c215.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  He took off all the buttons, because  without removing them, you cannot bring cleanliness.  I disassembled everything, blew it and cleared it up - it became much easier to breathe) Well, then I proceeded to what I wanted to do with this keyboard so long ago. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6f8/8ee/7e0/6f88ee7e09e789cb915a1b785378bac3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Surely the happy owners of this device might have noticed how much the black case of the device gets dirty.  Even if you print very carefully, there are still a lot of divorces and prints on the glossy black ‚Äúglass‚Äù coating, after 10 minutes after wiping the device with a cloth from the kit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/def/c26/749/defc26749cd770c920d839adc899b8f5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For a couple of years I got very sick of it and decided to act brutally) Once upon a time in one of the shops I bought a roll of self-adhesive film ‚Äúunder the metal‚Äù, with a fine polishing texture I liked (now this is found in almost any more or less stylish device ).  I cut off the desired piece and stuck it on the carefully cleaned surface, after which I gently smoothed all the bubbles with air. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/388/376/091/3883760916d4c4ed9aa63f7b0829b71f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Then he made all the necessary cuts with a clerical knife, since the contours here are almost rectangular everywhere.  Far worse were the small round buttons.  The point, of course, is not easy ... more precisely, nothing complicated if you sit down properly and do everything neatly.  I did actually on the knee, so the result was rather clumsy ... but for the first time it will come down) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b8a/179/b7c/b8a179b7c2c4cac455f66f74bad8945e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Then cut out the rest of the elements - for the most part these are round buttons.  There are only places for icons that light up on the F1-F12 when you press the Fn button ... but I decided that it would already be superfluous - why create additional difficulties, if in a couple of years I cope perfectly well without these icons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5d2/6bc/b8b/5d26bcb8b4b1b88df25f24fe048ef019.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Next, assembled the keyboard in reverse order, at the same time tightened all the screws.  Surprisingly, the torn off sticker perfectly clung back and there were simply no traces of opening the case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b70/97d/925/b7097d925922e1dd2955088e40c6ac2a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>As a result</b> : <br>  - Thoroughly cleaned all clavus, removed dust and all trash.  Wipe every button) <br>  - Tightened loose cogs and now the keyboard does not creak at all (it used to creak occasionally) <br>  - Made a glossy matte finish - finally I was no longer disturbed by prints.  Hooray! <br><br>  Now the device is completely ‚Äúunder the metal‚Äù, although it was necessary to glue it with a black matte film - it would be much more beautiful.  Even if it looks terrible, nothing prevents to tear off this sticker and return the device to its original appearance.  In general, here is such a budget mod;) Which, by the way, can be used in many more places - for example, for pasting a glossy frame around the screen of a netbook or laptop. <br><br>  It is a pity that on the favorite keyboard during the assembly suffered two buttons - "I (III)" and Page Down.  One broke a small retainer on the key (which is why the button cannot cling to it fully), and the ‚Äúscissors‚Äù itself broke under the other - it just initially chose not the cheapest device for experiments.  Well ... next time I'll be careful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/871/585/999/8715859996c58bd4e73d048b078d235e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>ps</b> By the way, try to look under your buttons - I'm sure there are a lot of tasty there too :) <br>  <b>pps</b> Logitech diNovo Edge is my favorite keyboard.  Honey, but it's worth it - my next keyboard, most likely, is it.  Although the backlight is not enough - I have to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/73459/">dream</a> . <br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/104159/">https://habr.com/ru/post/104159/</a></p>
