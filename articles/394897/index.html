This unique 256-core processor is designed to perform tasks related to voice recognition and a wide range of other tasks related to in-depth machine learning and self-learning. <br><br>  For the vast majority of potential target audience, KnuEdge, the announcement of a ready-to-work and tried-and-true neuromorphic architecture is indeed a long-awaited news.  But for the military industrial complex of the USA, where, as it turned out, the software and architectural complexes of the company have been delivered for five years already, a long-established reality. <br><br>  For some reason, right now, the KnuEdge Inc. manual.  considered that it was time to use processors developed and successfully tested in its laboratories and in field conditions for peaceful purposes, for example, just as they are already used in servers supporting the operation of the website and the company's specialized cloud service.

The architecture of LambdaFabric allows you to create computing systems that include up to 512 thousand processors.  At the same time, the delay time of data transfer from one rack to another is about 400 nanoseconds, which is quite comparable to or faster than the most up-to-date trunk buses used in supercomputers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f65/695/c3a/f65695c3a726fd645074ca5c19f554a0.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Features of the KnuPath processor architecture</b> <br><br>  On the crystal of each KnuPath processor, there are 256 DSP cores, 64 programmable direct memory access (DMA) modules, an integrated L1 router, which, in combination, makes it possible to provide the computational power of one 256 Gflops processor with a memory bandwidth of 3.702 Gbit / s.  The processor has 16 bidirectional I / O ports, providing data exchange at 320 Gbit / s. <br><br>  The KnuPath (Hermosa) power consumption is 34 watts (100 watts per 1 teraflops, 100 kW per 1 petaflops) computing power.  Despite the impressive level of power consumption, KnuEdge claims that, based on 1 W, the KnuPath processor, based on the LambdaFabric architecture, <a href="http://www.electronics-eetimes.com/news/military-startup-aims-large-neural-processor-chip">demonstrates an</a> efficiency of 2-6 times higher than the existing TOP alternative solutions. <br><br>  Being combined into computational clusters, KnuPath processors outperform competitors based on graphics processors by 2.7-8.1 times in performance and efficiency.  This conclusion is the manufacturer is ready to back up the key test results - FFT, Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiply and k-menas Clustering. <br><br>  According to Goldin, ‚ÄúAfter ten years of development and thorough all-round testing, the LambdaFabric architecture is entering the public market as a mature, matured technology that will allow system designers to respond to today's challenges and rethink the capabilities of future neural computing networks.‚Äù  The company will be able to present the latest production platforms and systems based on KnuPath processor, according to the head of KnuEdge Inc., in the second half of 2016. <br><br>  <b>Knuverse</b> <br><br>  With a highly efficient processor, KnuEdge Inc.  We have also developed and presented <a href="https://www.knuverse.com/">KnuVerse</a> voice authentication and verification <a href="https://www.knuverse.com/">technology</a> .  Unlike other voice processing technologies that underlie the Siri, Cortana, Google Home and Alexa programs, the system proposed by the authors has already solved two key problems of voice communication and identification - the problem of the influence of extraneous noise and the problem of system security in general. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/91b/9ea/3c1/91b9ea3c1495e7bd6626f4377a17cf55.png" alt="image"><br><br>  According to KnuEdge officials, KnuVerse technology has proven its effectiveness in the harshest conditions - on the battlefield.  In total, the company spent 5 years testing and improving the capabilities of the KnuVerse software package in real conditions.  Currently KnuEdge is ready to offer a range of enterprise applications to the interested audience, where KnuVerse is expected to significantly increase the efficiency of voice commands. <br><br>  ‚ÄúKnuVerse is already generating income in millions of dollars, and although we only started sales on a commercial basis, many leading Fortune 500 companies representing the banking, healthcare and entertainment industries have shown keen interest in the development,‚Äù said Kate Dilligan - Acting Vice-President of KnuVerse as part of KnuEdge Inc.  ‚ÄúWhen our corporate clients realize that they can instantly and without problems recognize and verify the users of their services on any device or platform, the wheels of innovation begin to spin.  They can finally forget about the problems of fundamental technologies and pay attention to the tasks of a higher order, such as improving the quality of customer service and creating new competitive advantages, ‚Äùhe added. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/UjLQetKm7QM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhDydSDwswJA5rimFd89ISqiISckg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Knurld - new authentication quality</b> <br><br>  Another development of KnuEdge Inc., presented at the level of the commercial offer, is Knurld technology, which uses a specialized software interface and Knurld.io corporate cloud service.  The company says that they have developed and implemented a fundamentally new, an order of magnitude safer and more convenient way to authenticate customers - a voice signature. <br><br>  Voice signature technology eliminates the need to transfer PIN codes.  Now your voice, which is always with you and which cannot be stolen or forgotten, becomes such a unique PIN-code - says on the <a href="https://www.knurld.io/">Knurld</a> technology <a href="https://www.knurld.io/">website page</a> . <br><br>  In addition to the above, the words of Mr. Dan Goldin, reflecting the essence of KnuEdge‚Äôs technology-oriented company‚Äôs new-generation technology, were interesting to say: ‚ÄúKnuEdge didn‚Äôt come to participate in the race, which aims to gradually improve technology, but in order to offer their fundamental transformation. "  Well, given the scale of the already proposed and approved solutions, his words do not look so pompous. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/648/d39/ac4/648d39ac489f4635a5aab030864ae515.jpg"><br><br>  <i><sub>Sources:</sub></i> <br><br>  <i><sub><a href="https://www.knuedge.com/">The official website of KnuEdge Inc.</a></sub></i> <br><br>  <i><sub><a href="http://nextbigfuture.com/2016/06/military-neural-processor-chip-comes.html">nextbigfuture.com</a></sub></i> <br><br><hr><br>  That's all, with you there was a simple service for choosing sophisticated <a href="https://dronk.ru/">Dronk.Ru</a> equipment.
