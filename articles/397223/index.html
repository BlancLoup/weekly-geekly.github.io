      The official characteristics of the new items will be known only during the presentation.  At the moment, it is assumed that the updated generation of Apple smartphones will include two models: iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.  Externally, the devices will be similar to their predecessors, including the resolution and screen diagonal. <br><br>  Important changes are expected in the company's products from Cupertino for the first time: the lack of a 3.5-mm headphone jack and a waterproof case.  Instead of two connectors, for audio and for data, the seventh generation of the iPhone will get a single Lightning interface with audio capability.  It remains unclear whether it will be possible to purchase an adapter for a classic connector, or if the company will finally force its fans to switch to branded headsets. <br><br>  Also, devices will get a more efficient processor labeled Apple A10.  It is assumed that the change and the amount of internal storage: according to rumors, the company plans to abandon the release of versions with 16 GB and 64 GB of internal memory.  In this case, it will be possible to purchase only 3 models: basic, with 32 GB of memory, expanded with 128 GB of storage, and the top model with 256 GB of flash memory. <br><br>  An interesting decision on the background of a variety of Chinese devices on Android looks like a solution of Cupertino on the memory.  It is expected that its volume will be 2 GB for iPhone 7 and 3 GB for iPhone 7 Plus.  The resolution of the main camera matrix for the base and Plus models will remain 12 megapixels.  But the 5.5-inch model will be equipped with an advanced camera with two modules - one of them will provide optical image stabilization and a wide viewing angle, the second - an optical zoom. <br><br><h3>  How to buy iPhone 7 in the official <a href="http://www.apple.com/us/">Apple. Store</a> before anyone else? </h3><br>  Pre-order for smartphones is scheduled for September 9th.  It is planned that the store will be available from September 16 or 23.  In order not to wait for the official start of sales of iPhone 7 in Russia, you can purchase a smartphone right in the American <a href="http://www.apple.com/us/">Apple.Store</a> by pre-order, having issued it right at the start.  And take advantage of the transfer of <a href="http://pochtoy.com/">Pochtoy.com</a> - then in 7-15 days after shipment the desired device will be on hand. <br><br><h4>  Get a virtual address in the USA </h4><br>  Many US stores are shipped exclusively in the United States.  <a href="http://www.apple.com/us/">Apple</a> is no exception.  Therefore, for the purchase you will need an American address.  The easiest way to get it is to register at <a href="http://pochtoy.com/">Pochtoy.com</a> . <br><br>  Immediately after registration, each user in the personal account gets access to the ‚Äúvirtual address‚Äù, which is the address of our warehouse.  Recall that we have two of them - in Pennsylvania and in Delaware, you can choose any.  It is these data that must be used further for the order. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/79c/76c/881/79c76c88182248e88bc5e10b707bcf06.png"><br><br><h4>  Sign up at the American Apple Store </h4><br>  After the address is received, you need to go to the American <a href="http://www.apple.com/us/">Apple.Store</a> and select the desired iPhone model, as well as its color and memory size.  Do not forget that most smartphones in the United States are sold with a contract (linked to the operator).  In Russia, only devices without binding, the so-called SIM-free, will work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/210/998/8fa/2109988faa144ff0a347e81c84c05ebb.png"><br><br>  It is not yet known what frequencies LTE will support the new iPhone, sold overseas.  Just in case, let us warn you that the 7 and 38 bands are the main ones for Russian cellular operators. If such versions are available, you need to choose them.  Otherwise, it remains hopes for the 20 frequency, which was previously present in all versions of the sixth generation of the iPhone.  We have it available in some cities, but you should check with your own operator (although, for the sake of updating, why not change it?).  Then it remains to choose the necessary accessories and additional options (for example, extended insurance). <br><br>  After this begins the process of registration of goods.  The sequence is as follows: click Add to Cart, check order information, click Check Out.  In the Shipping Address form that appears, we indicate the ‚Äúvirtual address‚Äù obtained in the personal account of Pochtoy.com.  In the Payment Information field, you must enter your card details, and in the Billing Adress, once again duplicate the Shipping Address (or use the Same as shipping information option).  And pay with your (or virtual) card. <br><br>  Attention!  Officially, the <a href="http://www.apple.com/us/">Apple</a> site in the United States sells its products only to residents of the country, so you should use a VPN anonymizer.  Preferably with the ability to set a US IP address. <br><br><h4>  How and when will the smartphone arrive in Russia? </h4><br>  Some time after the company starts delivering devices across the United States, you will receive a notification via SMS or email about the delivery of the new smartphone to the warehouse.  Then you need to choose one of the available delivery methods.  It is best to use After the device arrives at the warehouse, you will receive an e-mail notification and will be able to arrange the shipment to your home. <br><br>  In the CIS countries, the fastest, safer, and cheaper of all will be Mail Post Express.  Only 19 dollars (+ insurance for the desired amount).  Together with insurance for the full cost, taking into account possible prices, shipping is unlikely to be more expensive than $ 30.  And in 8-16 days it will be possible to open the box with the new iPhone 7. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b54/591/a78/b54591a783994dfcb334ae7391c416ca.png"><br><br><h3>  <a href="http://pochtoy.com/">Pochtoy.com</a> Gift </h3><br>  In connection with the expected excitement, <a href="http://pochtoy.com/">we</a> decided to donate to compatriots not only to purchase a new Apple without Russian margins, but also to give the opportunity to save on sending long-awaited devices. <br><br>  For all readers of Geektimes, we extend the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/pochtoy/blog/279572/">previously submitted</a> coupon.  Thus, the receiving package will be completely free, and the internal account will be replenished by $ 5 (which means that the shipping cost will be reduced by this amount). <br><br>  And do not forget about <a href="http://pochtoy.com/page/mr_rebates/">cashback</a> ! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c23/862/10f/c2386210f4bb49f3b6ae70f0d4442153.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397223/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397223/</a></p>
