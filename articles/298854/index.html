I continue to talk about the letters in the blog of old friends - Textbroker. <br><br>  One of the most frequent questions to me at various retail conferences is how to correctly squeeze a letter about a new product on the client base.  Almost everyone comes on the same rake, which then interfere with life.  The highlights are: <br><ul><li>  Never try to hide flaws. </li><li>  Write strictly after the release of goods and personal use experience. </li><li>  Do not even think about trying to push it all in a row. </li><li>  Do not crush technical characteristics. </li></ul><br>  <b>Well, do not forget that any trip to the store today is a subtype of entertainment.</b>  Therefore, it is worthwhile to arrange a small show from the presentation of the goods - for example, to lower it from a slide, drive it by KAMAZ or, even harder, give it to a six-year-old child.  Or a raccoon.  It is possible and easier.  I'll tell you now. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  The most important thing is not to push </h4><br>  To begin, once again we will go through the errors above.  So, the most terrible sin of any marketer or PR manager is to promise more than it is in reality.  This is expressed in the wildest desire to exaggerate the attractiveness of the product.  It works once.  Twice it works worse.  For the fifth time, no one believes you anymore, and you turn into a company that "breeds suckers."  Therefore, it is right to promise less. <br><br>  You must wait for the actual appearance of the product and try to use it as your customers use.  Yes, it will take a few days, but it's damn important.  If you yourself did not participate in the development (and this is most often the case), then you will discover a couple of new unusual things that you would not have known in life if you had not begun to use the product.  Secondly, you identify possible shortcomings.  Thirdly, while you will play with this thing, the first users will already have an opinion - so you will insure against unforeseen flaws that ‚Äúsurfaced‚Äù in places where no one was waiting.  This happens with any product, so you should think of it as a process, not an exception. <br><br>  When you have an understanding of what is wrong in the product, do not forget to mention it.  The world is full of rainbow announcements - and very little comes true in practice.  Do not bypass the problem moments, talk about them right away.  If you are objective, they trust you.  The buyer is not a fool, and he himself will find the necessary information about the shortcomings - it is better if you do it for him, so at least you will have control and the opportunity to explain why this is so.  I remember stories with professional cameras (which are without ‚Äúgreen‚Äù auto modes) - if not to say in advance that without two higher ones, nothing will work out, they will be bought by rich bros, and then they can call from Canar in support and promise to hide who made it bespontovy fotik that even the phone takes better. <br><br>  In general, think all the time that customers know where you live. <br><br>  Next, do not try to sell the product to everyone.  Mark clearly, who needs it and why, and tell about it.  Segment and differentiate until you realize that you can, without doubt, recommend, with your own word.  If you are trusted, it sells best. <br><br>  Well, do not push the characteristics - but be sure to mention what it means.  In simple words. <br><br><h4>  Now, how to write, and what you need in the letter </h4><br>  Usually the product has a description on the site, where it is more or less detailed.  In the letter on the client base (this is the original task), duplicating it is, of course, possible, but not worth it.  It is better to arrange a small show of what you did with the goods. <br><br>  Here the main tool is also your personal experience of use.  Tell us exactly how you used this thing (or give examples from the practice of customers), tell us about the development and tasks (and solutions, of course), explain why the product is exactly as it is.  That is, either arrange tricks with the product (crash tests, unusual use), or let me look behind the scenes of development, or give something unusual and interesting about the product. <br><br>  For example, I was somehow asked about a Swiss watch.  Weekend offhand was a few: <br><ol><li>  Find people who wore the previous generation of this watch, and ask what they like there. </li><li>  Make a list of stars that are in this series. </li><li>  Show crash tests - dip the clock in a bath with foam, boiling sea water, boil it in a borsch, throw it in the window with Nokia 3310, sit on it, crawl on the glass with keys, freeze, fry with meat and so on. </li><li>  Tell about what exactly the difficulties were in the development and how they were solved, that is, to give more ‚Äúunderworld‚Äù about the product. </li><li>  Well, just start with unpacking and tell about the impressions of two weeks of use in comparison with other watches. </li></ol><br>  Remember that the most powerful topics are those where there is your point of view and something useful (or entertaining) for your reader at the same time.  Here, in the ezine, it will be especially noticeable.  And, of course, do not forget that if you cannot read the letter out loud to a friend, it is better not to send it. <br><br><h3>  Other materials </h3><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/203490/">Why 98% of the texts on your sites do not work.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/203490/">At all.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/203490/">And how to fix it.</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/236365/">How I chose a hedgehog copywriter</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/textbroker/blog/22162/">How to make TZ radio easier</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/mosigra/blog/22192/">How to describe an online store product</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/textbroker/blog/22770/">How to write the main, and what should not be there</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/textbroker/blog/23218/">Transaction letters</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/textbroker/blog/23596/">Presentation for attachment to the letter</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/textbroker/blog/24122/">Letter of thanks</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/textbroker/blog/24252/">What to write in the cards, if the goods are very similar</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298854/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298854/</a></p>
