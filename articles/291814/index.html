      This is what the BOX-system of full-fledged business management means, and not under-CRM. <br><br>  But first things first. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Automated Hiring </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/676/92c/c25/67692cc2541845ed821da4d68fe96da2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Think about how much time you spend on selecting and hiring the employee you need?  Publish a vacancy, select candidates, invite and check everyone ... Of course, not all roles are suitable for this mechanism, but we hire automated back-end and front-end developers. <br><br>  How does OneBox understand that we lack staff?  As we already wrote earlier, <a href="http://webproduction.ua/crm-sistema">CRM</a> thinks who does how many tasks per day, and when the growth in the number of tasks over the last 2 months is more than what employees can accomplish, an automated decision is made ‚Äúwe lack XXX back-end developers‚Äù. <br><br>  This decision can confirm or cancel the manager, with one button.  If confirmed, then OneBox: <br><br><ul><li>  creates mail xxx@domain.com which will collect responses. </li><li>  publishes a vacancy on sites (as there is no API, then through a parser or WebDriver). </li><li>  begins to collect responses to the mail. </li></ul><br><br>  When a person sends a response to the mail, the system automatically creates a task, contact, links them together, and sends an automated response: <br><br>  In the test, we ask you to write a simple script that you need to commit to our repository.  The validity checks PHP CodeSniffer. <br>  Once a day, OneBox checks the repository, if the necessary code is the system automatically: <br><br><ul><li>  sends the candidate an invitation to an oral interview. </li><li>  the manager (technical director) sets the task to be on the spot at the right time and talk the candidate. </li></ul><br><br>  The manager conducts an interview - and he has only two options in this task: suitable or not suitable.  If suitable - OneBox: <br><br><ul><li>  sends the standard job offer, which immediately describes all the working conditions, requirements for internship and after. </li><li>  waiting for a person to respond one week </li></ul><br><br>  If the person answers that he agrees, the system: <br><br><ul><li>  forms and offers the candidate an internship date; </li><li>  the system administrator sets the task "to prepare the workplace" </li><li>  if there is no free equipment in the warehouse, it sends a notification to our partners with a request to ship the necessary components, and the accounting department to pay. </li><li>  On the desired date, the employee is given access to OneBox (to himself) and 150 internship tasks are set for each day. </li><li>  on the desired date, the task of the head is to take a new employee to work. </li></ul><br><br>  The system stops when the number of developers needed is balanced. <br><br>  Of course, schedules, text tasks and invitations are already pre-set by man.  And the text is written personalized.  Reaction conditions are also pre-registered. <br>  If the employee answers is not standard - this is seen by the person responsible for hiring - and manual individual responses are included.  And at any stage a person can intervene. <br><br><h4>  Automated dismissal </h4><br>  And now the most interesting: there are certain KPIs (key performance indicators) that cannot be broken.  For example, for <b>more than 2 months in a row an</b> employee does not fulfill the minimum plan (although the minimum plan is executed within 2 weeks) - the system makes a decision about his dismissal. <br><br>  Of course, the rules of the game are known to both parties in advance and the chance of an unexpected dismissal is 0. <br>  All rules are customizable. <br><br>  OneBox signals in advance that "you can not cope, fix it there".  There are a lot of such notifications, and you need to completely hammer on a job or an internship in order for the system to decide to ‚Äúfire‚Äù.  All these metrics are publicly available, everyone sees them.  Everything is transparent.  And with a huge amount of time. <br><br>  <b>The purpose of the function is not to dismiss.</b>  The purpose of the function is to consolidate objectives and performance indicators and allow them to be achieved. <br>  Many people say that dismissing is bad.  And how about the performance of indicators?  <b>Not doing your tasks is a deception of the employer</b> : the theft of time and money in the company. <br><br><h4>  KPI Settings </h4><br>  Of course, if our client does not want to use these functions, he will not use them. <br>  First, the company‚Äôs orkhshema is configured (role tree), then the rules for calculating the KPI for each role, and only then, after a while (when there is statistics), you can set up automated responses to KPI. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d84/96c/d4a/d8496cd4aa514732b504915c1e4ded62.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In a real business, a manager looks at KPI and decides ‚Äúwhat to do next‚Äù.  If solutions are repetitive - why not automate? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291814/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291814/</a></p>
