And this is necessary in order to make fewer mistakes, and to minimize the consequences of the mistakes made. <br>  In other words, big data management has the main purpose of making quality decisions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/67d/e38/9e0/67de389e099847caaa5c413d8f39c48e.jpg"><br>  <sub>A still from "The Special Opinion" (Minority Report) by Steven Spielberg based on Philip Dick's novel (2002 - 20th Century Fox, DreamWorks SKG).</sub> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  ... phenomenon </h2><br>  Big data owes its emergence and strengthening of positions in the business world to the increased flow of digital information.  To a large extent, its excess and the inevitability of managing such a stream made us think about how to do this most rationally.  On the other hand, the obvious needs of companies in obtaining additional information about markets, consumers, competitors, employees, market conditions lead to the search for new sources of information.

      Do not forget that there are many options for direct collection, including the registration of a wide range of parameters and information that were previously absent.  Take at least the recording sensors in mobile devices. <br><br>  Expanding fixation tools in various digital and analog form - this is also the state registration, which is read, stored and processed.  An increased number of devices have formed a network of digital recorders that generate huge amounts of data.  Intensively developing "Internet of things" will increase the arrays of processed and stored data.  Let's not forget that both users themselves and digital devices themselves create big data using algorithms. <br>  Observing the dense flows of information, the business sees in them certain advantages and wants to use them legally. <br><br>  <i>The phenomenon of big data</i> is not so much the result of an increase in some information in the outside world, as the ability and ability to collect more and more information from the outside world.  Even yesterday, the supermarket manager was forced to put an employee at the entrance to count visitors to assess the popularity of his establishment.  And already "today" he removes data on the movement of the visitor through the sales area and forms the optimal flow of buyers.  Will it be possible to ‚Äútomorrow‚Äù forecast the time of the visit of a specific consumer and his purchases in a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù shopping space with individual offers and services?  But this is not the result of some revolutionary change in the volume of information space - it is the result of increasing the ‚Äúdensity‚Äù of the data collected. <br><br><h2>  ... density </h2><br>  <b>The density of the recorded data</b> - the amount of data collected on a single object (event, process, phenomenon). <br><br>  <b>Increasing data density</b> is an increase in the amount of data collected about a single object (event, process, phenomenon). <br><br>  The peculiarity of fixing and recording digital data is discreteness.  Each specific data collection is a separate event, to a certain extent independent of other similar ones.  Because of this, the collection of data collected in each collection event is finite.  Typically, such a data set exists within the framework of the task and depends on the tools and methods of registration.  It is permissible to speak about the registration of the state of an object (event, process, phenomenon), as about the formation of a certain set of data at a given point in time.  The temporal factors of state data collection have a particular impact, and they are taken into account along with many others. <br>  The increasing volume of captured, collected, stored, processed data forms their streams.  The performance of some types of devices that generously generate data creates problems of mass data exchange and their ‚Äúpacking‚Äù into some general information transport channels or into productive storage containers. <br><br><h2>  ‚Ä¶ availability </h2><br>  Big data gives a great competitive advantage.  And this statement is true if their collection, processing and analysis are accompanied by an appropriate competent strategy and business readiness for change. <br><br>  Today, big data is available to large and information-secured companies.  But tomorrow, access to them, with the help of various tools, will receive a medium and small business.  Information infrastructure business development is going at an impressive pace.  And it is not correct to say that big data is suitable for mass sales markets and large-scale production.  Even highly specialized enterprises and service companies are able to obtain serious potential for development from big data. <br><br>  Given the increased specialization in individual competencies related to big data, it is appropriate to say that their future is the service shared functionality of third-party consultants, and not total processes within one company.  The model is optimal when, with a general internal strategy for big data management, a business assigns narrow work directions to external professionals.  For example, the collection of specific data and their presentation to the customer in the prescribed form.  Something like now, web-analytics tools, poorly understanding the site‚Äôs mission and strategy, without being thoroughly interested in its owners, authors and beneficiaries, collect and provide data on the number and quality of visitors. <br><br><h2>  ... analytics </h2><br>  Big data has every chance of becoming a big analytics industry over time.  Today the IT infrastructure of collecting and processing vast amounts of information is in priority.  But with their further improvement, the issues of competent data processing and generating objective and relevant decisions based on them are becoming more and more obvious.  <i>Big analytics is a</i> lot more complicated than just big data.  But only with a sufficient level of penetration of the latter into the business environment and into the professional competencies of management, a clear need for a high level analysis will be formed. <br><br>  Big analytics should be provided with serious and convenient tools, both program, and directly analytical.  It is obvious that the need for qualified personnel will increase.  But if for the information technology development of big data services it is possible to attract trained IT specialists, then big analytics will require specially trained professionals.  They combine, in a certain way, the knowledge and experience of information technology with the knowledge and experience of subject areas. <br><br>  In spite of serious progress in the field of computer processing of information, so far and in the future, it is impossible to do without a person.  Specialists are needed who will intensively research the data and who will be able to formulate tasks that are clear from the point of view of the analysis algorithm.  Finding and fixing data errors is an obvious and pressing problem that such professionals solve.  But what they offer the IT market as a tool - we'll see. <br><br>  Undoubtedly, big data will form various markets: from those in which they sell data in lots of different volume and quality, to those in which high-tech services are provided with machine time for supercomputers. <br>  The transition to the collection and processing of information in excess of traditional volumes can be a good reason for specialized or extensive reengineering of business processes (and business objects involved in them).  At the same time, you will have to recognize the priority behind the model of integrating big data into a business model across the entire structure and all areas. <br><br><h2>  ... big morals for big data </h2><br>  Do not forget about the ethical side of the issue of big data.  To de-personalize data about customers, consumers and other market entities is unrealistic - it will deprive them of their value.  But big data in one form or another, and especially from internal sources, contains personal or attributive personal data. <br><br>  Requires serious protection against unauthorized distribution of big data.  Yes, and customers are not happy when there is a total collection of information about them.  Exhortation that this is done for their own good does not help.  <i>No one wants to be followed.</i>  And if he does not find in himself a sufficient motivation to transfer data about himself to someone, then he will not do it.  Normal and reasonable behavior that has to be considered. <br><br>  At the legislative level, more stringent restrictions will be introduced.  And it is absolutely clear that these restrictions will conflict with the information needs of the business. <br><br>  <b>What big data will turn into is an effective tool for increasing the comfort of life or terrifyingly spying on everyone and everything, will it be possible to create a ‚Äúuniverse of useful information‚Äù or will the ‚Äúabyss of dark materials‚Äù be built.</b> <br><br><h2>  Look into the future ... </h2><br>  To get answers to various questions regarding business development, markets, customer preferences, market factors ‚Äî in one way or another, professionals are trying to simulate the situation in the future and extract adequate information about opportunities and threats. <br><br>  Big data is one of the tools for this, very convenient, statistically reliable and effective.  But everything is too difficult with predictions and predictors, both in terms of the feasibility of forecasts, and in the socio-ethical aspect. <br><br>  It is not by chance that not only economists, mathematicians, physicists, but also philosophers, writers, for whom the future is not a practical advantage, are set as the problems of foresight, but a complex and fragile network of human virtues and vices full of reasonable doubts and moral contradictions. <br><br>  The story ‚ÄúMinority Report‚Äù (‚ÄúOpinion‚Äù) of the famous science fiction writer Philip Dick suggests that we think about this topic and decide to what extent you can trust and blindly follow <b>convincing analytical predictions</b> . <br>  <i>Is there a place in such situations for personal opinion and decision?</i> <br>  And whether to take into account the <u>special opinion of</u> one professional, albeit very different from the opinions of most other respected experts. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300374/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300374/</a></p>
