  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Beeline protects SMS fraudsters?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Yesterday, the spouse became a victim of SMS fraudsters - 700 rubles were written off from Beeline‚Äôs account.  Employees of the company did not begin to understand and recognized the fact of the debiting of funds as legal, despite prompt requests.  Details under the cut. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Wife for a long time and seriously use the services of Beeline.  About six months ago, I wanted a new phone - I bought a Sony-Ericsson XPERIA Ray on Android.  It is used mainly for calls, periodically exchange mail.  Yesterday came a request to update Google Translate - resolved, and after a few minutes, SMS from short numbers fell down that there were not enough funds in the account to pay.  I checked the balance - instead of 700 rubles there were 60 left. They began to sort it out together - a suspicion immediately arose, under the guise of updating Google Translate another program worked.  It turned out that in the general list of programs there are two with the same translator icon, one of them is simply called ‚ÄúInstallation‚Äù.  It is clear that, under the pretext of updating it, funds were written off.  How she got into the phone - I don‚Äôt know, maybe the spouse once went to the link in SMS spam and installed it by chance. <br>  Call in Beeline, explain the situation to the operator.  The operator sends us to the company RM-Invest (site sms911.ru), with which they have an agreement on the provision of short numbers.  The logical question is why do we communicate with scammers who have already deceived us once, left unanswered.  On the Internet, by the way, there are a lot of complaints from those who suffered from the activities of this campaign. <br>  We remind the operator that Beeline everywhere declares that it is enough for them only to report the fact of fraud - and they will take action immediately.  In response, the offer ‚Äúto get a discount on the services rendered‚Äù and to put a ban on sending paid SMS by using the command 0858. Since there was practically no money left in the account, they agreed to return 200 rubles and left a statement.  As a result, today it was reported that ‚Äúan inspection has been carried out, information about the fact of ordering the content has been confirmed.  The charges are correct and correspond to the cost of the services provided. ‚Äù <br>  It's no secret that mobile operators get a good percentage of SMS sent to short numbers.  Judging by the current situation, Beeline companies allow SMS fraudsters to quietly do their job for sharing their income. <br>  In order to avoid a repetition of this situation, a ban was placed on sending paid SMS using the command 0858 (by the way, for some reason, MTS has to contact the office to perform a similar operation).  In an amicable way, such a ban should be the default on all tariff plans. <br><br>  PS It was more logical to transfer the post to ‚ÄúI resent,‚Äù but I do not have enough karma for this.

      UPD: <br>  The comments tell me that 200 rubles is the share of Beeline in the scam and the return of this amount, the operator is trying to disclaim all responsibility. <br>  Dissatisfied with the post clarify why I consider the situation a fraud and what does Beeline have to do with it: <br>  The funds were written off from the account by deception, under the pretext of updating the useful Google Translate program.  There were no messages about sending paid SMS. <br>  The operator was informed about the fraud in a timely manner and we are not the first victims - it is enough to type sms911.ru in the search. <br>  In reply, the answer is that the ‚Äúcharges are correct‚Äù. <br>  Before our eyes, there is an example of banks that return money according to a client‚Äôs statement about fraud. <br>  Conclusion - SMS payments, at the moment, are too risky and it is more expedient to refuse to use them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142295/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142295/</a></p>
