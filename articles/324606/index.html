  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Definition of development vector in the project</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <i>If the ship has nowhere to sail, then no map will show the correct route.</i> <br><br>  In this article, I present a methodology by which the vector of the project‚Äôs development can be determined.  It is good in that it allows us not only to move frantically forward, but also to include more awareness when choosing goals.  In the end, we want to live more happily without losing clarity, to work effectively with enthusiasm, to use our potential, to preserve the benefits achieved.  Whoever does not want this, he can click on the cross and continue not to read, because then we will discuss a technique that may seem both simple and complex at the same time.  It is simple because it allows you to find superficial problems and solutions in a few steps.  And it is complicated because it ultimately determines the algorithm of its own actions, and no one other than you or your assistants will make them.  But this is also a plus, since you yourself can decide what to do and what not. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/90b/af0/7c2/90baf07c2a6e2c45a09a09d3d2e583f1.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For some reason, in our society the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdevelopment is unconditionally accepted and everything new and brilliant is of interest.  New technologies, new opportunities climb almost through the window.  I have long been observing how easily manipulators can first convince that there is something undoubtedly better than you already have, and then slip your ideas.  But over time, it turns out that the ideas were untested, if not crazy.  And who put a lot of energy into them, they got disappointed and a handful of funny ponts.  Recall, for example, any incident with a software upgrade, when under the onslaught of enthusiasm and curiosity after the update something fell off and stopped working.  The same goes for mindlessly introducing trendy project management schemes. <br><br>  I am guided by the principles of stressless action - no revolution, smoothly improving the current state of affairs, not impairing useful functions.  The algorithm assumes first the collection and processing of information according to a certain scheme, then - the development of steps and the actual actions themselves.

      The first point of the four that must be filled in when collecting information is the current state of affairs.  Find a few things you are happy with and would like to keep.  On closer examination, some benefits, such as having a comfortable toilet or the opportunity to work from home, are very valuable.  In the rush of goal setting, you can carelessly lose the good that has already been gained.  If everything has become so boring that you no longer notice what is pleasant, then compare your working day with the working day of the programmer of the extreme north, Africa or Nepal.  And even better - go there for a couple of weeks to feel the hard way which means lack of convenience, and the Internet a couple of hours a day with a gasoline generator.  Do not want?  Me too. <br><br>  To get started, get an electronic document or a piece of paper in which you will gradually collect information from various sources.  It‚Äôs good to have a common document and give it to the team members to see each other‚Äôs thoughts.  Do not be lazy to listen to what colleagues are saying and convert it into the format of this technique, since in a formal setting, not everyone will want to share their thoughts.  Sometimes interesting thoughts can be heard at a party or corporate party, when people are relaxed and open.  Be creative, do not dwell on formalities, be closer to people. <br><br>  So, we write down the first paragraph of the answers to the question ‚ÄúA) what do we have now and at the same time want to continue to have it?‚Äù.  Offhand write down how much happens.  Then, when possible, supplement.  The educational moment of this list is to realize that we have quite a lot of benefits, just some are not valued as they should be valued.  With the fact that it is on the list, nothing special needs to be done in the near future, unless it is subject to change.  But we must bear in mind that with time everything changes, wears out and does not get better by itself. <br><br>  The following leading questions are built on the principle of Descartes square.  I took them from the system of psychological counseling and adapted for the group.  Their peculiarity is that they allow people with different metaprograms of the psyche to reveal what needs to be acquired and what to get rid of.  People with the ‚Äúfrom‚Äù meta-program will mainly generate thoughts to get rid of difficulties.  People with the ‚Äúk‚Äù meta-program will mainly generate thoughts about the acquisition of benefits.  At the same time, it is possible to trace from whom which metaprograms are active for the subsequent drawing up of a dialogue.  So, the following two leading questions have the wording: <br>  ‚ÄúB) what do we have now and at the same time DO NOT want to continue to have it?‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúC) what are we now NOT having and at the same time wanting to start enjoying it?‚Äù <br><br>  This pair is the most informative from the point of view of ‚Äúwhat should be done?  where and where to go? ‚Äù.  That is, according to the list ‚ÄúB‚Äù we will look for ways to get rid of disturbing phenomena.  According to the list ‚ÄúB‚Äù we will look for ways to acquire the desired missing goods.  Collect any information, even a joke.  Then it can be adequate and transformed into something more real. <br><br>  There remains one more insidious question, - ‚ÄúD) that we now DO NOT have and at the same time DO NOT want to have it?‚Äù.  The peculiarity of this issue is that it reveals the fears and fears that roam in dark corners of consciousness and involuntarily keep people in suspense.  An example of such fear can be ‚Äúdisperse everyone‚Äù, ‚Äúreduce the salary‚Äù, ‚Äúcollapse the building‚Äù, etc. ... Although this does not happen and this is undesirable, nevertheless, such thoughts should be taken into account to complete the picture.  Collect fears will have an informal way, because it is unlikely that someone wants to talk about it directly.  Usually this is grumbling in dark places, so please be patient.  It is better to leave this cell accessible only for oneself, so as not to warm up dark thoughts, which can be partly fantasy, partly true. <br><br>  The result is a square that I filled with examples from practice.  Your listings will be different. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6aa/1f1/06e/6aa1f106eb2ea70584ef63a2410d180b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  This table is enough to take action, but some more steps can be taken. <br><br>  Firstly, it is necessary to eliminate the striking contradictions in points ‚ÄúA‚Äù, ‚ÄùB‚Äù, ‚ÄùC‚Äù (we do not touch point ‚ÄúG‚Äù yet).  Contradiction can come from different people and subgroups in the event of a conflict of interest.  In this case, it is necessary to negotiate.  How exactly to settle contradictions is the whole science of soft skills.  In this example, the effect on the technical item on item B.4 may affect item ‚ÄúA.4.  clean office ‚Äù, and games for stress relief B.5 can increase the noise in the office. B.5. <br><br>  If one person generates conflicting demands, then most likely he manipulates and sabotages.  It is difficult to cope with an experienced manipulator, but it is possible if you find the right approach.  At the institute, in psychology lessons, we conducted games in which we had to make collective decisions by complete consensus.  The conditions were such that, after discussion, the game was considered lost if at least one participant remained disagreed.  To win and get a reward, you had to negotiate with even the most intractable. <br><br>  Next, process the cell "B".  To do this, we transform it into the ‚ÄúB‚Äù cell format.  The fact is that just getting rid of the problem is not enough.  It is best to redirect the available energy in a creative direction.  This is easy to understand, because even in school tasks, a steam locomotive has both a starting point and a destination point.  If you just move away from the point of departure without a goal, then most likely you will get an empty walk.  Therefore, to begin with, we simply rework the wording, which will deepen the understanding of the direction of movement. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f3b/4e3/cdc/f3b4e3cdc8c6b21140ce3d177caf6d39.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Next, you need to distinguish between specific requests and blurry.  Specific requests can be measured, for example, the noise level in the office is measured by the device and even there are standards for this.  And abstract, blurry require specification.  For example, it‚Äôs difficult to say just how stupid units are and how much units they can be improved about just ‚Äústupid TK‚Äù.  Therefore, it is desirable to have some samples for comparison, to specify what ‚Äúsmart and understandable TK‚Äù means, how much text there should be, which items are included or excluded, etc. ... In linguistics, this is sometimes called bringing general phrases to a performative, states when it is clear what to do and how much to do.  If you do not agree on blurry phrases, then it will be on hand for lovers to manipulate or get out. <br><br>  Another important point in negative phenomena is their implicit positive side, which can also be distinguished and written into one of the cells.  For example, blunt TK are a sign of mess, and in troubled waters, sometimes you can fish for a fish and play with something or be creative.  I hope the approach is clear. <br><br>  The next step is to proceed to the most unobvious point ‚ÄúG‚Äù.  First of all, in this list it is necessary to separate empty fantasies from real fears.  The arrival of green zombies may be unrealistic, but equipment theft is quite acceptable in our country.  If any concerns have a real basis, then we must take care of how to mitigate, avoid or find workarounds. <br><br>  Some managers try to manage the team on the basis of fear, fueling its rumors about running out of money or some kind of confusion.  Sometimes our citizens like to sit on adrenaline and tell each other horror stories with big eyes.  The choice is yours - to warm or cool these concerns.  Sometimes stress mobilizes and makes it work better.  Sometimes it is exhausting and makes the work meaningless.  Psychologists in the 60s experimentally revealed the formula for maximum motivation and came to a ratio of three to one.  It is necessary to have three ‚Äúcarrots‚Äù and one ‚Äúpepper‚Äù in order for the movement to be as motivated as possible.  In other words, there should be three motivating factors on one demotivating one level.  Therefore, leaving only positive points will not work. <br><br>  Next, we transform each item into a set of actions and also analyze so that the effect of the actions does not conflict and does not worsen the other items.  We rank actions by efficiency by simple sorting.  For a more complete analysis, we do logical goals promotion, define hidden goals and value systems of the participants, look for critical factors.  We find the set of measures that, with minimum effort, will cover the maximum number of points of our goals. <br><br>  // D.A.
