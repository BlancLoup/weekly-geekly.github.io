Like you, I spend a lot of time behind the monitor screen (even two).  And if this is a release, deadline or urgent question, then the time at the computer smoothly develops into most of the day. <br><br>  Recently, I was asked by an acquaintance, how can my eyes withstand it and the vision remains good ?!  I always answer that years of training help.  Do you think this is sarcasm?  Only partly :) In fact, this is training. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>Further, I will ask not to read those who already know everything and those who do not like ‚Äúnon-medical‚Äù terms.</i>

      Back in 2004, when we worked for two weeks without a break before the presentation of the project, to which the customer had already invited guests, rented a room, well, ‚Äúpaint thickened‚Äù on us, they started to dry up my eyes very much.  And in the end, by the constant rubbing of my fingers, I received severe irritation.  As a result, conjunctivitis and other troubles.  In general, the final of the project was given to me at the time. <br><br>  I will not annoy you with history anymore, after I began to actively look for means and rules how to work at a computer correctly.  Proper posture, lighting, contrast, brightness, color temperature (warm / cold), ... it really helps.  But this is not a secret ingredient. <br><br>  The video clip that a friend showed me was the real solution to the problem.  Sorry, I can't find this video now.  In the video, Mr.I.I., with the harsh hardening of a post-Soviet scientist, spoke about the structure of the eye, how the history of medicine in the eye developed and what we have now.  And much more interesting.  And at the end he showed exercises for the eyes.  Yes I.I.  argued that the eyes are muscle.  And so that she was always in the form of her need to "swing." <br><br>  <i>Next, who was completely bored, please leave this audience</i> <br><br>  These are simple exercises that take 3-5 minutes.  All you need is clean hands and a calm environment. <br><br>  <b>Training</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9d0/dd8/96a/9d0dd896a33449f2acd4007037fe1fb1.png"><br>  - Pound your palms until hot. <br>  - Then cover the fingers of one hand, with the fingers of the other, so that the angle between the ‚Äúpalm of the boat‚Äù is straight. <br>  - After, like ‚Äúglasses‚Äù put on your nose.  Hands should be slightly concave so that when blinking you do not touch the eyelashes of the palms, but at the same time so that the light does not penetrate through the gaps (you can do in the dark). <br>  - All exercises to perform slowly and to a pleasant pain.  Keep your eyes open. <br><br>  <b>Exercise 1</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/90e/49d/93d/90e49d93d6e34db0a6b69959d1100960.png"><br>  Next, we look all the way to the right, on inhalation we return our eyes to the center and on the exhale we look all the way to the left.  Look 10 times in each direction. <br><br>  <b>Exercise 2</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/2df/719/6e7/2df7196e7f9b4628b3b7f1233e22257d.png"><br>  Next we look all the way up, on the inhale we return the eyes to the center and on the exhale we look all the way down.  Look 10 times in each direction. <br><br>  <b>Exercise 3</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/2c9/015/751/2c90157514d742c2a6f373e812a3a656.png"><br>  Next, we look all the way to the upper right corner diagonally, on inhalation we return the eyes to the center and on the exhale we look all the way to the lower left corner.  Look 10 times in each direction. <br><br>  <b>Exercise 4</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1df/f06/31a/1dff0631a0954512a49fae915835314d.png"><br>  Next, we look all the way to the upper left corner diagonally, while inhaling we return our eyes to the center and as we exhale we look all the way to the lower right corner.  Look 10 times in each direction. <br><br>  <b>Exercise 5</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d9c/7be/05c/d9c7be05cec64debb972d14f015a8ed8.png"><br>  Slowly delineate the eyes circle, at the maximum possible angle.  So that we all look at the extreme position.  Repeat 5 times in each direction <br><br>  <b>Exercise 6</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e39/786/9f7/e397869f725e4d6385692c69d0843eb2.png"><br>  Gently and exhale bulging a little eye.  Repeat 5 times <br><br>  <b>Exercise 7</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ffc/dfd/536/ffcdfd53670d4d5bb9cb22b71418286a.png"><br>  Strongly squeeze (as if afraid that nothing got there) and unclench eyes.  Repeat 5 times. <br><br>  <b>Exercise 8</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/811/d3b/84d/811d3b84de9c49579b78bd3a36bbba35.png"><br>  Quickly blink for 5-7 seconds. <br><br>  <b>Completion</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/6e0/e80/732/6e0e807323e94ba5a6d3a69c2f14d797.png"><br>  Now let's hold our hands a little in place, eyes open for 10-15 seconds.  Then open your eyes.  If all the colors became brighter, and the light in the room more, then the exercise, you did right.  Try and let your vision always be great! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/331062/">https://habr.com/ru/post/331062/</a></p>
