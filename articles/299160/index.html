That was in 1994, when I was in the business of ‚ÄúTurnkey company registration‚Äù.  Then it was difficult and long to register enterprises, and I came up with a chip: first I registered the company for myself, and then I sold it.  The client received the enterprise in 1 day.  And I got the money. <br><br>  The young man convinced me to sell him a company for half the price.  How did he do it?

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Scam 1: Directory of Tver banks </h2><br>  He came to my office, said that he was publishing a directory of Tver banks, but he needed a firm, and only enough money for half the price.  And he made me a super offer: placing my ad for free and selling another ad in my own pocket.  The price of each advertisement was announced as for the whole company, so the offer looked quite attractive.  I agreed. <br><br>  When we went to register the transfer of the enterprise, he managed to talk his teeth to a lawyer, and he missed that the boy was still 16 years old, and he simply did not have the right to own his enterprise. <br><br>  Then he borrowed a computer, an inkjet printer and a scanner.  Then he took a loan office.  Then he printed 400 copies of the directory (instead of the promised 10,000).  Nobody checked, he distributed to advertisers several pieces, they were satisfied. <br><br>  I then earned it: I sold two of my advertising space.  Although in fact I became an accomplice in the scam - the circulation was false. <br><br><br><h2>  Scam 2: Fake Russian Lotto Tickets </h2><br>  After some time a lotto ticket seller came to the young man.  He said that they would be scattered with terrible force, and proposed to print fake ones.  The degree of protection was really low.  Tickets have been printed and sold out. <br><br>  It is usually difficult to win the lottery, but then they were lucky: they printed winning tickets.  In jail, they first put the seller and then our hero.  He spent 8 months and received a conditional.  He sat in a separate chamber for economic crimes and made good connections there. <br><br><br><h2>  Scam 3: Rospoligrafservice </h2><br>  Realizing that many businessmen are gullible, like children, he began to take Ponta: he registered the company Rospoligrafservice.  So here is modest.  He began to dress expensive, bought a leather briefcase, carefully selected words.  He chose the words so carefully that at times it was simply impossible to talk to him: he could think for 20-30 seconds before he squeezed the word out of himself. <br><br>  He always hired people very willingly, but he never promised a specific salary, and always complained that the previous ones were just lazy people who didn‚Äôt do a damn thing.  He quickly gets rid of everyone as soon as new candidates start looming on the horizon. <br><br>  But the main thing - he always did a terrible job.  Whatever he did, everything gave the work of the person who first saw Photoshop.  However, there is little strange here, all the work was always performed only by such specialists. <br><br>  Why no one complained or sued?  The answer is obvious - kickbacks. <br><br><br><h2>  Scam 4: Maps of Tver and Tver Region </h2><br>  Then came the company "Maps of Russia".  The recipe is the same: cheap labor, pretentious name, bad quality, kickbacks.  Cards were issued only Tver and the region.  There is a legend that only this company has the right to print maps of Tver, and no one else.  Advertising platforms were on sale.  Cards were printed, of course, by ten times undersized. <br><br><br><h2>  Scam 5: Tver region tourism website </h2><br>  Through the maps, a connection with the tourism committee in the Tver region appeared.  There was a project to create a website - a single reference center for tourism in the Tver region.  We need someone to do this.  To whom?  "Maps of Russia" were right there.  Were allocated money from the budget.  Moreover: the site has not yet appeared, and the single reference center has already concluded contracts with sanatoriums and hostels and started receiving money for information services. <br><br>  How did you manage to take money from enterprises for non-existent service?  Very simply: it was said that this is done under the auspices of almost the governor himself.  Well, otkatiki, otkatiki.  The site was eventually stolen from one to one, reported.  Firm closed. <br><br>  With a kind smile, my friend began to say to everyone: ‚ÄúI mastered the budget with six zeros!‚Äù <br><br><br><h2>  Scam 6: Design of the stand of the Tver region </h2><br>  At the end of 2006, the company I worked for was contacted from the development department of the Tver region.  It was necessary to urgently arrange the stands of the region for international exhibitions.  Representatives of the department complained that the contractors did to them what the hell, and the governor is extremely displeased.  In particular, a wonderful solution was proposed for the agriculture stand: to stretch a photo of flax on the entire wall.  Flax was removed on a soap box, it was some field with barely distinguishable blue flowers. <br><br>  Who made the design?  Of course, "Maps of Russia".  We in a terrible rush made a good design, at the same time booklets and presentation.  Tver region received second place for the design of the stand, giving way to the Krasnodar Territory.  But the money still went through the "Maps of Russia", and we would not have received anything if all of a sudden the head of the department of agriculture had not been planted. <br><br>  Do you think our hero was worried?  Nothing like this.  It took a little time, and everything was back to normal.  Taking our design as a basis for "Maps of Russia" began to make booklets and design.  Of course, everything has become much worse, the idea has gradually degraded, but what to do: orders go to where the leaders carry out a flexible retreat policy. <br><br><br><h2>  Conclusion: Learn to do business in Russian </h2><br>  When I stand at the bus stop, and my friend drives by on an expensive SUV, I wonder: where did I miss my chance? <br><br>  Why, when I took out loans in the 90s, I always gave it with all the crazy interest.  I was afraid for my reputation.  Then everyone took loans and did not give.  And I, a fool, gave.  I thought - I will prove myself responsible.  Who needs it? <br><br>  Why often, when I tried to make good websites, sooner or later there appeared those who did bad, but agreed with the customers? <br><br>  Why did we make the Tver region in a short time a good stand, if in the end all the same reap the benefits of those who know how to hang noodles on their ears? <br><br><br><h2>  Afterword </h2><br>  To be honest, I did not expect the article to evolve into ‚ÄúPost of Evil.‚Äù  What to turn around disputes about the SUV.  I conceived the topic as a joke on the topic of successful young American start-ups <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/success_stories/101757/">Christian Owens</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/success_stories/101330/">Lippiner</a> . <br><br>  In fact, I do not envy my friend who earned his SUV by doing frank hack.  It is necessary to envy those who made a great product and managed to make money on it.  But, again, to envy not money, but the fact that they managed to provide for themselves and their loved ones in their favorite business. <br><br><br><h2>  Authorship </h2><br>  When copying material, please refer to my <a href="http://vadimgalkin.pp.ru/" title="Personal page of Vadim Galkin">personal page of Vadim Galkin</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299160/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299160/</a></p>
