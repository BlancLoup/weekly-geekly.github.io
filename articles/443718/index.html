  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fantasy game with 300 thousand races</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When I started working on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/659540/Warsim_The_Realm_of_Aslona/"><em>Warsim: the Realm of Aslona</em></a> , there were only two races - Humans, who created several kingdoms, groups of gangsters and rioters, and goblins (Goblins), who had several kingdoms and a handful of tribes.  At the time of beta, Warsim 0.7.4 has 325,142 races in the game. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/261/ed7/8f1/261ed78f1fbe64682f4e190bdc2b0ae4.png"></div><br>  <i>Last updated banner</i> <br><br>  Yes, that's right - more than three hundred thousand fantasy races, but what does this mean?  How do these races differ, what are their uniqueness and differences? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To know what awaits you, I took a list of 10 completely random races in the game. 
      <br>

        </script>
      <br>
    <ul><li>  Forest shadows (Forest Shades) </li><li>  Small semi-giants (Lesser Half-Giants) </li><li>  Demonic Protonofod (Demonic Protofolk) </li><li>  Coastal Ghouls (Shore Ghouls) </li><li>  Combat Turkeys (Warrior Were-Turkeys) </li><li>  Coast Goblins (Coast Goblins) </li><li>  Hill Wizards </li><li>  Mini Ogres (Mini Ogres) </li><li>  Northern Antelopelings </li><li>  Gold Orclings </li></ul><br>  Yes, these fighting turkeys are definitely to be feared.  But for now it all seems just names, but you must be wondering how they differ and what is the uniqueness of these races. <br><br>  To answer this question, I need to first explain the system of generation of races.  The system retrieves the race from the list of 86 standard races.  This list includes many classic fantasy nations, such as orcs and elves, but there are also races unique to Warsim, such as Centaars (these are like centaurs, only half are not humans, but elves) and protonarods (cavemen). <br><br>  Taking one of the races, the system adds a prefix to it.  Part of this move is inspired by how the <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/40692/small-world" rel="noopener nofollow">Small World</a> board game creatively works with the races. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7e9/6ac/8c2/7e96ac8c267738721e149178274944d4.jpg"></div><br>  Combine race and random prefix to get a specific race with mixed and common abilities.  Having thought up this system, I tried to create a huge bunch of options for different prefixes.  Now I have 262 prefixes, and their number is growing. <br><cut></cut><br>  Each of these prefixes has different effects and affects the characteristics in different ways.  For example, the hermit elves in the game will be poor and not worth plunder, the bandit gnomes (Bandit Gnomes) will rob characters (including you), invincible centaurs (Invincible Centaurs) should be avoided, doomed wizards (Doomed Wizards ) at some point they will begin to suffer from the disaster predicted by him, while the two-headed newts (Two-Headed Mermen) will have, as the name implies, two heads. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/437/d62/8a5/437d628a55a8dbe88d2e5fbf2d222eb5.png"></div><br>  <i>The two-headed ruler of the triton kingdom</i> <br><br>  Almost all prefixes have many effects following a particular pattern ‚Äî usually prefixes that significantly increase the force of a race in a battle reduce the size of its population in order to avoid the appearance of irrepressible races with a huge number;  however, some races can still circumvent this limitation.  It is worth expecting that there will be many inhabitants of the kingdoms of small goblins, and in the kingdoms of giants there will be only a few inhabitants. <br><br>  In addition, racial prefixes have other effects, they can affect the civilization of the group.  An uncivilized group will not be contacted through in-game diplomacy, so diplomats will not be able to reach the savage gnomes. <br><br>  Some racial prefixes can also affect the color of the faces of its members, so the Arctic Hobgoblins will have blue skin, the lava halflings (Lava Halflings) will turn red, the purple ogres (Purple Ogres) will be purple, and so on. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ed8/c90/77d/ed8c9077dd6d4bf3a2e6ae0e60664a9c.png"></div><br>  <i>The top leader of the purple ogres named Bagagg in his procedurally generated crown</i> <br><br>  Also in the game there are changes in faces, for example, in childlike Orcs (Childlike Orcs), faces will be like in children. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/88d/641/80b/88d64180bc0c9561ba85b67263b9471f.png"></div><br>  <i>Ruler of the kingdom of detkopodobny orcs</i> <br><br>  Another unique racial prefix is ‚Äã‚Äãthe eyeless, eyeless necromancers (Eyeless Necromancers), for example ... this is a rather terrifying concept.  Below is an example of triple random generation of a race in one world.  All these three separate kingdoms of eyeless necromancers have a very different appearance (thanks to the random color system applied to humanoid races). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d6/066/6bd/0d60666bd85a0b08575b79dd7e1d5a57.png"></div><br>  <i>Three examples of eyeless necromancers</i> <br><br>  There are other prefixes, such as "unmanaged" (Ungovernable), in the race where the leader often changes, "primitive" (Primitive) - wild tribes with whom it is impossible to speak, and "devouring death" (Deatheater), which become stronger with each murder (which makes them a serious danger for the final stage of the game). <br><br>  Peaceful ents (Pacifist Ents) do not attack, invisible halflings (Invisible Halflings) are completely invisible (unless you find an artifact that makes them visible).  Psychotic Orcs (Psychotic Orcs) can attack you in one move and become your friend in the next. <br><br>  So, a lot of effects.  Each individual race has its own unique combination of strength, civilization, population and appearance, and diversity will only increase over time ( <em>if you come up with something interesting, then I am always ready to add new effects to the game</em> ). <br><br><h2>  Analysis of 325 142 different races </h2><br>  It will be interesting to analyze this value of 300 thousand.  To do this, I divided the data into three categories: animal races, ‚Äúnon-animal‚Äù races, and orcs (which are also ‚Äúnon-animal‚Äù, but separated to show the difference). <br><br>  The first part of the data (red) is procedurally generated race animals: anteaters (Anteaterfolk), spiderlings (Spiderlings), half-rats (Half-Rats), and so on.  The system takes one of 194 different animals and turns it into a half-being, an evolved creature, a werewolf creature, a creature creature, a creature creature or a creature creature.  This allows you to create a huge and diverse number of races of creatures, which, as you can see, makes up the majority of these 300 thousand. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/151/15b/34a/15115b34a521f15918cd89b236efb3e5.png"></div><br>  <i>Pie chart of three different sets of races</i> <br><br>  The second part of the data (purple) denotes everything that is not a procedurally generated animal race: ogres, dwarves, elves, humans, and so on.  Orcs are excluded from this category, because I want to show them separately. <br><br>  There are 786 different orcoped races, because by default there are three orc races (Orcs, Orks and Orclings).  When mixing these three with 262 prefixes, 786 types of orcs are created. <br><br>  And this is almost all 300 thousand fantasy races of the game, mostly originated from animals.  Is it a record?  How many more races can you squeeze into a game before the thermal death of the universe?  I have no answer to these questions! <br><br>  Here is a recent image of the base Warsim races, each person procedurally generated for the respective race. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f18/0a7/e07/f180a7e07dc0fa4671271d18710b4b67.png"></div><br>  If you have any suggestions for new races or prefixes, then let me know in the subreddit or with the message: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/warsimrpg">www.reddit.com/r/warsimrpg</a> . <br><br>  You can also add your own races to the game using the built-in modding tool (Extras menu). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/443718/">https://habr.com/ru/post/443718/</a></p>
