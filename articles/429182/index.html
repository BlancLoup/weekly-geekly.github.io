      You probably heard that we are in the midst of an AI revolution.  We are told that machine intelligence is progressing with amazing speed, relying on ‚Äúdeep learning‚Äù algorithms that use huge amounts of data to train complex programs known as ‚Äúneural networks‚Äù. <br><br>  Today's programs can recognize faces and record speech.  We have programs for detecting subtle financial frauds, for finding relevant web pages in response to ambiguous requests, for laying the optimal route almost anywhere, these programs defeat grandmasters in chess and Go and translate between hundreds of languages.  Moreover, they promise us soon and everywhere unmanned vehicles, automatic diagnostics of cancer, house cleaning robots and even automatic scientific discoveries. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3052885/mark-zuckerberg-facebook">recently stated</a> that over the next five to ten years, the company will develop AI in order to "exceed the human level in all basic senses: sight, hearing, language, and general understanding."  Shane Legg, chief research associate at Google DeepMind, <a href="http://future.wikia.com/wiki/Scenario:_Shane_Legg">predicts</a> that "AI will surpass the human level in the mid-2020s." <br><br>  As a person working in the field of AI for several decades, I witnessed the failure of many such predictions.  And I am sure that the latest forecasts will not come true either.  The problem of creating human intelligence in machines remains greatly undervalued.  Today's AI systems are sorely lacking in the essence of human intelligence: an <i>understanding of the</i> situations that we experience, the ability to understand their meaning.  Mathematician and philosopher Gian-Carlo Roth asked the famous question: "I wonder if the AI ‚Äã‚Äãcan ever overcome the barrier of understanding."  For me, this is still the most important question. <br><br>  The lack of human understanding in machines is underlined by the problems that have recently appeared in the fundamentals of modern AI.  Although modern programs are much more impressive than 20-30 years old systems, a number of studies show that in-depth training systems demonstrate the unreliability of completely inhuman ways. <br><br>  I will give a few examples. <br><br>  ‚ÄúA person with an uncovered head needs a hat‚Äù [The bareheaded man needed a hat] - the speech recognition program on the phone recognizes this phrase as ‚ÄúUnder the direction of a bear, a person needs a hat‚Äù [The bear headed man used a hat].  The phrase ‚ÄúI put a pig in a stall‚Äù [I put the pig in the pen] Google Translate translates into French as ‚ÄúI put a pig in a pen‚Äù [Je mets le cochon dans le stylo]. <br><br>  Programs that "read" documents and answer questions about them are <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07328">easily fooled</a> if short, non-essential pieces of text are added to the document.  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01697">Similarly,</a> programs that recognize faces and objects (the glorious triumph of deep learning) fail if they slightly change the input data using certain types of lighting, image filtering and other changes that do not in the slightest affect the efficiency of object recognition by humans. . <br><br>  One recent study <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00401">found</a> that adding a small amount of ‚Äúnoise‚Äù to a face image seriously interferes with the work of modern face recognition programs.  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03305">Another study</a> , called ‚ÄúThe Elephant in the Room‚Äù with humor, shows that a small image of an extraneous object, such as an elephant, in a corner of the living room image strangely causes computer vision systems to learn deeply about other objects in deep learning. <br><br>  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04671">Moreover</a> , <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04317">programs</a> that have learned to skillfully play a specific video game or board game on a ‚Äúsuperhuman‚Äù level are completely lost with the slightest change in conditions (changing the background on the screen or changing the position of the virtual ‚Äúplatform‚Äù to beat the ‚Äúball‚Äù). <br><br>  These are just a few examples that demonstrate the unreliability of the best AI programs, if the situation is slightly different from those in which they were trained.  The errors of these systems range from ridiculous and harmless to potentially catastrophic.  For example, imagine an airport security system that will not allow you to take a flight because your face was confused with the face of a criminal, or an unmanned vehicle that, due to unusual lighting conditions, did not notice that you were going to the intersection. <br><br>  Even more alarming are recent demonstrations of AI vulnerabilities in front of so-called ‚Äúhostile‚Äù examples.  In them, a malicious hacker can make certain changes in the image, sound or text that are invisible or insignificant for people, but can lead to potentially catastrophic AI errors. <br><br>  The possibility of such attacks is shown in almost all applications of AI, including computer vision, medical image processing, speech recognition and processing.  Numerous studies have shown the ease with which hackers can deceive systems of recognizing faces or objects with <a href="">scanty changes in the</a> picture.  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08945">The inconspicuous stickers</a> on the ‚ÄúStop‚Äù road sign make the machine vision system in an unmanned vehicle take it as ‚ÄúGive way‚Äù, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01944">modifying the sound signal</a> , which sounds to a person as background music, orders the Siri system or Alexa to secretly execute a certain command. <br><br>  These potential vulnerabilities illustrate why current progress in AI rests on the barrier of understanding.  Anyone who works with AI systems knows that behind the fa√ßade of human-like vision, speech and ability to play, these programs do <i>not understand at all</i> - in any human way - the input data that they receive for processing, and the result that they give out.  The lack of such an understanding makes these programs susceptible to unexpected errors and inconspicuous attacks. <br><br>  What will it take to overcome this barrier so that the machines can understand more deeply the situations they encounter and not rely on small details?  To find the answer, you need to turn to the study of human knowledge. <br><br>  Our own understanding of the situations we encounter is based on broad, intuitive ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù concepts about how the world works, and about the goals, motives and likely behavior of other living beings, especially other people.  In addition, our understanding of the world is based on our basic abilities <i>to summarize</i> what we know, to form abstract concepts and to draw analogies - in short, to flexibly adapt our concepts to new situations.  For decades, researchers have experimented with teaching AI to intuitive common sense and sustainable human abilities to generalize, but there is little progress in this very difficult matter. <br><br>  AI programs with a lack of common sense and other key aspects of human understanding are increasingly deploying into real-world applications.  While some people worry about the "superintellektele" AI, the most dangerous aspect of AI is that we trust too much and give too much autonomy to such systems, without being fully aware of their limitations.  As a researcher, Pedro Domingos noted in his book ‚ÄúThe Main Algorithm‚Äù: <b>‚ÄúPeople worry that computers will become too smart and take over the world, but the real problem is that they are too stupid and have already taken it</b> . <b>‚Äù</b> <br><br>  The race for the commercialization of AI has put tremendous pressure on system builders who work ‚Äúfairly well‚Äù in narrow tasks.  But ultimately, the goal of developing a <i>reliable</i> AI requires a deeper study of our own remarkable abilities and a new understanding of the cognitive mechanisms that we ourselves use to reliably understand the world around us.  Overcoming the barrier to understanding AI will probably require a step back - from ever larger networks and data sets back to the roots of the industry as an interdisciplinary science that studies the most complex scientific problem: the nature of intelligence. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/429182/">https://habr.com/ru/post/429182/</a></p>
