  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is missing Gmail. 4 free deskun features</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last year, Gmail's mail service reached 1 billion users, and since then has only increased its audience.  The popularity of the service is so great that even Microsoft has to open up Google users with the opportunities that were previously only available in Outlook.com in the email client for Windows 10.  This is understandable, since Gmail is completely free, has the best spam protection in the world and additional features for automation and convenience of correspondence.  However, several very important functions are not available to ordinary users, without which it is difficult to imagine comfortable work.  This is especially true for those who are used to working with clients through the Gmail web interface.  For example, a notification about reading a letter is available only in a corporate account.  But in the modern world, people are so accustomed to messengers that sending letters "into the void" is unusual and wrong.  Feedback should be required. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/612/5ec/fa1/6125ecfa1bc040a498e1b61d09fce721.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Most of the inaccessible functions of users are closed by third-party services that are created by developers in the form of extensions.  But here another problem arises.  For example, the most popular browser in the world, Google Chrome is considered the most "heavy."  On computers with a small amount of RAM, working with it becomes a torment.  If you also install five to ten necessary extensions, then the resulting "combine" can easily hang the operating system.  So you have to compromise: either buy a powerful computer, or carefully monitor the choice of installed extensions.  Of course, you can change the browser, but for the convenience of Chrome, it‚Äôs still ahead of its peers in the workshop. <br><br>  Who may need extensions that make it easier to work with Gmail and add the functions you need?  First of all, these are people who use email as the main method of communication.  Thus, freelancers, managers, project managers, entrepreneurs and even managers in large companies often communicate with customers and colleagues.  These people value time and tend not to spend it on routine actions.

      For these users, we will consider the four most important functions that are not available in the basic functionality of Gmail - the timer for deferred sending letters, the possibility of deferred reading with a reminder, reports on reading and templates for quick answers.  All of them are in the service-extension <a href="https://deskun.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_campaign%3Darticle_3%26utm_content%3D1">Deskun</a> , which works in browsers Chrome and Yandex. <br><br>  Install the extension.  Gmail will open automatically.  Confirm access and start working. <br><br><h3>  Mail tracking </h3><br>  The most important feature that Gmail users lack is mail tracking.  In any modern messenger you always see if your interlocutor has read the message, and expect a response.  In Gmail, you send emails and wait for responses to it.  For work, this situation is unacceptable.  You can install the mail program, but it is unnecessary movement.  Now a person is used to working in one browser and leaving it in extreme cases.  You can buy a corporate account, but this is money and time spent.  At Deskun, this feature is completely free. <br><br>  ‚ÄúTrack reading‚Äù is enabled after installing the extension automatically for all letters that will be written.  But you can easily turn off tracking by clicking on the eye icon before sending it.  If you have not done so, then after sending the letter you will be able to track its status.  In the Inbox folder opposite the read letters will be a green eye-icon, and opposite the unread - gray.  In the letters themselves there are the same icons, and if you hover the cursor on them, then you can see the reading time. <br><br>  For convenience, separate pages with lists of monitored emails are automatically created in the Sent Items folder ‚Äî a page for those that have been read and for those that have not yet been read. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/399/772/d06/399772d067d24cb79181070074906e61.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/522/d99/e51/522d99e5197e4138bec873105d91aa05.png"><br><br><h3>  Delayed send (Send later) </h3><br>  This feature is very useful for customer service managers.  Often there is a situation when a person does not have time to process the flow of incoming correspondence during working hours.  He has to work in the evenings and nights, prepare documents and send letters.  But send them after hours - moveton.  As a result, you have to save drafts and spend time in the morning sending.  There are still such scenarios, when the letter should be sent at a strictly designated time.  For example, this could be an important press release.  The manager has to sit and wait for the indicated time to make this newsletter. <br><br>  In Deskun there is a deferred dispatch.  You prepare the letter and set the departure time for it: at least in 5 minutes, at least next week.  This function can be used when creating a new letter.  At the bottom of the panel, click on the green delayed send icon, select the time and date, and then click "Send."  The letter will go to the Drafts folder, where you can edit it, change the departure time, or delete it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/0ae/a4c/098/0aea4c098b0f4f3085461377754340fa.png"><br><br><br><h3>  Sleep (Snooze) </h3><br>  The Snooze feature will be useful to those who work with a large incoming mail flow.  You choose any letter and attach a timer to it.  After a specified time, it will appear in the source folder as unread.  This way, you can use Gmail to manage tasks.  For example, if you need to return to an important letter from a client and you are afraid to forget about it, then it is not necessary to create a note on this in a third-party program and set reminders.  Just put to sleep this letter. <br><br>  Click on the Deskun icon opposite the desired letter, select ‚ÄúRemind me through‚Äù and set a timer.  The letter will go to the Deskun: Snooze folder.  This feature also works for outgoing emails.  When sending, click on the orange ‚ÄúRemind me through‚Äù icon on the bottom panel and set the timer. <br><br>  You can also set reminder conditions ‚Äî an email will appear in the folder if: <br><br><ul><li>  The addressee did not respond to it. </li><li>  The addressee did not open it. </li><li>  Anyway. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d76/e63/7f8/d76e637f8c7546678341c272fe305033.png"><br><br><br><h3>  Message Templates </h3><br>  If ‚ÄúFalling asleep‚Äù is useful when you have a lot of incoming emails, then templates will help those who write and respond a lot.  Create ready-made text templates and quickly call when writing letters.  Click on the ‚ÄúChoose a template‚Äù button in the panel below and select the desired one from a previously prepared list.  The text will be loaded into the letter.  You can create a new template in the Deskun account in the "Message Templates" section. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/6b2/7a9/f99/6b27a9f995c341b6a823fa0841ce675c.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/734/33a/b97/73433ab971ac4d1685fce16ad2527843.png"><br><br><h3>  4 in 1 </h3><br>  We talked about the four free features of <a href="https://deskun.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_campaign%3Darticle_3%26utm_content%3D2">Deskun</a> , which can significantly speed up Gmail email.  These features are implemented in other extensions, but you have to install them separately and pay for them.  In this case, there is always the risk of significantly slowing down the browser and the computer.  In addition, the Deskun extension is not limited to these free features.  This is a complete user support system and a task management system inside Gmail with the necessary functionality: tickets, assignment of support agents, ranking of requests by priority, setting deadlines, automatic response to requests, etc.  Thus, using Deskun's paid features, any team can work productively with e-mail and organize work within the company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/330852/">https://habr.com/ru/post/330852/</a></p>
