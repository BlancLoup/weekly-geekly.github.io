  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hypothetical development courses. For everyone, for everything and everything</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I'll start from afar. <br><br>  Once, when I was still in school, a class at 8, our computer science class began with the basics of HTML.  The task was simple: first create one HTML page with the use of basic tags, and then compile several pages with a common theme (I chose an article about the development of the Soviet computer industry).  Of course, the teacher explained the meaning and use of standard tags and, in general, made some kind of basis.  But for me, who was already planning to devote his life to IT, this was not enough. <br><br>  Then I turned to books and the Internet.  For those times both that, and another did not give any full complex of actual and clear knowledge.  Books, for the most part, are translations from English, based on an equally English-speaking audience.  And the Western style (not even the type) of thinking has little in common with our, still Soviet, style.  (Take, for example, the love of presentations that we have not fully understood until now.) The result was predictable - in my head, a typical schoolchild, two learning paradigms mixed up, which simply confused me with misprints and rapidly outdated materials.

      The Internet was more supportive and gave squeeze on specifically asked questions.  But, first, the question had to be correctly asked, and given the fact that it was not easy to formulate it, there was little confusion.  And, secondly, the Internet ... let's say, not a very reliable source of this information itself, since it‚Äôs a bit lazy to keep it up to date, and mistakes and understatements due to laziness and non-professionalism hit the head hard. <br><br>  Even then, unconscious impulses like ‚ÄúIf you want to do well, do it yourself,‚Äù began to emerge, but only recently came to a conscious mind.  I tried to find good, quality courses on the latest version of ActionScript for the latest version of the Adobe Creative Suite, in Russian, preferably with a video application.  Incredibly, I did not manage to find a solution that satisfies me. <br><br>  And why not do it all yourself?  Why not write courses in all known programming languages, in accessible Russian, with the help and support of school teachers, university professors?  It was strange for me to realize that no one has yet done this. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of course, this is a huge job.  It is necessary not only to write a course, but to find out what senior professionals say on the topic, ask them to check the information, add some clarifications, make amendments.  If you make a conscience, you also need teachers and teachers who will be able to look at the material soberly and assess its complexity, consistency, methodical nature, the amount of time it takes to master it, and break up the contents.  The coordinated work of proofreaders and professional editors who can identify and correct all errors, both actual and grammatical, stylistic, and punctuation, is necessary.  And all this - only for one course. <br><br>  But what can be achieved in the end?  You can make the ideal manuals for training professional staff in the field of IT.  If large companies like Yandex, Google Russia, Intel Russia, Rambler, Mail.ru Group, serious universities like ITMO, Moscow State University, SPSU, LETI, Polytech, their students and teachers, local professional groups like Linux User Group, Microsoft Certified Professionals, if the state noticed and adopted such an initiative at the level of the Ministry of Education ... Who knows, perhaps our perestroika defeat in the field of everything connected with computers could be slightly offset by a strong methodological base? <br><br>  In my head, a more clear picture of what I would like to achieve and exactly how to do it began to line up slowly: <br><br><ul><li>  Write material on your own and by volunteers who are interested in this idea.  Among these people, you can safely bring teachers in schools throughout the CIS - there are only those who are attracted by the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãteaching, and not money and fame.  The professional sphere itself is also important - one of the characteristics of geeks is not only the maniacal desire for something new, but also the desire to share knowledge and experience, local communities of enthusiasts on this and hold on. </li><li>  The material should be free for everyone.  In this connection comes a prerequisite for licensing works under Creative Commons. </li><li>  The work should be carried out on the principle of Wikipedia, in which each participant can make a contribution by strength, ability and level of competence.  Although it is categorically pernicious to completely copy the Wikipedia style: it is impossible to allow the appearance of low-quality material on an ad-hoc basis. </li><li>  Financial and resource support is needed.  It is likely that IT companies and educational structures, if they don‚Äôt want to take part themselves, can agree to provide some kind of assistance, if you contact them directly.  For example, some teachers of ITMO St. Petersburg, Polytech and LETI lecture at AMSE and at the same time are employees of Google and Yandex.  There is also a Computer Science Club based on the Russian Academy of Sciences. </li></ul><br><br>  Even if I dumped everything in a heap, my thoughts turned out to be even over the edge, but I have already begun some minor progress in the process.  I purchased a VPS hosting on reg.ru, registered the codeloop.org domain in r01, and started translating courses from W3Shools.com with a view to their subsequent modification and concatenation with other specialized courses.  Reached a preliminary agreement with the teachers of the IT departments of St. Petersburg Technological, Electrotechnical Universities, as well as the University of Service and Economics, although so far I have nothing to show them.  I started writing a course on HTML from zero, with an eye to the grade 9 level of a general education school, where the ‚ÄúInformatics‚Äù discipline is actually absent. <br><br>  But there were some questions that I would like to ask the community of habrahabr.ru and the readers of the portal (you can answer a@batollo.ru). <br><br>  How do you find such an idea attractive to yourself? <br>  Would you be interested in the emergence of such a resource? <br>  Would you like to take part in such work, provided there is no financial compensation, on pure enthusiasm?  What could you advise for the success of the venture? <br>  What would be worth using a self-made engine, MediaWiki with deep modifications, dokuwiki, something else? <br>  What could you add as additional ideas? <br>  What are the disadvantages you see in this approach? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118780/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118780/</a></p>
