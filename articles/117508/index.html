  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Something about the initiatives. Continuation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Most recently, the idea to rework the tragic ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/examination/117202/">1</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/internet/117275/">2</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/internet/117452/">3</a> ) site of Skolkovo, to make it a professional version, appeared in Habr√©.  With this post I want to tell to what we have now arrived, what we have done and what plans we have for the future.  I will also conduct a brief analysis of applications that have already been submitted for participation. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  How did it all begin? </h4>  It all started with a estronas <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/estronas/" class="user_link">user account</a> : <blockquote>  Maybe we throw, do we make a normal site?  We put on a server with habra-immunity, we will fill and share news and most importantly, be proud?  After all, the innovation center was strangled in one day!  Udaltsy) </blockquote><br><br>  And then a similar comment by <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/dgusev/" class="user_link">DGusev</a> 'a provoked a mass of ‚ÄúI am ready to help‚Äù answers: <blockquote>  It can be really to make a site in a more modern and thoughtful version.  Can, for example, on the domain ii-gorod.ru to place?  Do you think the patriotic spirit of the community is enough to demonstrate the real qualifications of developers in our country?  That would be a serious bureaucracy response. </blockquote><br>  The very next day I wrote <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/estronas/" class="user_link">estronas</a> with <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/zaisl/" class="user_link">zaisl</a> and gave access to the document in Google Docs.  Initially this document was a useful tool, we could express our ideas and discuss them.  But over time, the number of participants has grown greatly.  Diverse and overwhelming ideas went (from supporting start-ups to helping veterans), and they commented well on a comment about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/DIY/117314/">youthful maximalism</a> .  Some even decided to first write their platform for work, write their own forum, and everything, naturally, in 3 days.

      As a result, attempts to use the tools of self-organization failed.  Some have created their own documents (with blackjack and whores), the number of sources of information has grown to 5. The group in Skype for 20 people (now 25) has become a constant stream of a mixture of flames and pinch conversations ‚Äúon the case‚Äù.  It was time to stop. <br><br><h4>  Collaboration Problem Solving </h4>  In order to somehow change the situation, I took the liberty to slightly change the approach to work, which was later approved by other coordinators. <br><br>  If initially all were registered simply by inscribing themselves and their ideas in Google Docs, then I offered to register through the <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/dryga.com/viewform%3Fhl%3Dru%26formkey%3DdGZwaWI0aDRhaHRWaFpEN1RRTzJlX2c6MQ">form</a> .  It added a lot of additional questions that could solve ideological problems (for example, during registration users answered whether they wanted to do a big project, whether they just wanted to remake i-gorod, publish a report of expenses, etc.) <br><br>  I had to completely abandon the discussion of ideas using old methods; their backup was just made.  We temporarily stopped talking to let some cool down.  At this time, I registered the domain habrateam.com and tied it to Google Apps, a <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/estronas/" class="user_link">estronas</a> registered habrateam.ru.  We decided to continue the work on the international version, since  when registering a domain via Google DNS, records are made and updated almost instantly, and in the .ru zone you only have to wait 24 hours to redirect (by the way, we are grateful for the help in configuring DNS: the domain control panel does not accept the TXT records that Google requires ). <br><br>  The only conflict I observed was between me and several people who insistently demanded a forum on our domain.  I persistently refused their request, believing that the forums were created for communication, and not group development, and that the reproduction of information sources would increase the complexity of the infrastructure. <br><br>  Now we have all the necessary tools for the collaboration: <ul><li>  a list of all participants, their vision of the task, their skills and the amount of time they can give us; </li><li>  Google Docs for publishing documents; </li><li>  Google Groups for the collaboration of departments (designers, web designers, coordinators) among themselves; </li><li>  Google Moderator for voting and making general decisions; </li><li>  Google Code Review (or Github) to organize the activities of developers; </li><li>  A convenient way to distribute rights, everyone will have their own account and mail on our domain (before the rights were handed out to everyone). </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Analysis of applications </h4>  At the beginning I promised to determine the exact goal through a survey in the registration form.  Let's get started  By 17:10 Moscow time, 25 people submitted their applications.  From them 4 are not registered on Habr√©, 2 from which asked for invites. <br><br>  The distribution of the desired roles (each could offer himself to several roles, because the amount of interest is more than 100): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/37873d7f/aa829957/c9e1c21b/3f972929.png" alt="Roles that members want to take"><br><br>  Everything is quite logical and correct.  There are enough people on the back-end and front-end, there are designers and layout designers, a lot of testers.  Only PMov accumulated more than necessary. <br><br>  The most popular language for the back-end was PHP, everyone knows it.  So on it we will write.  For the back-end developers, the best claim is <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/ur001/" class="user_link">ur001</a> , which made the habr engine. <br><br>  On average, for the first month of work, people agreed to allocate 50 hours, but, in general, people agree to work either a lot (80-100 hours per month, a record - 120) or a little (20-40).  3 people found it difficult to answer this question. <br><br>  To understand what resources we may not have enough, we need to look at the dependence of time on the role (the number of man-hours per month is shown in brackets): <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/97a1662d/24d6fbb2/86bf11e7/0447d221.png" alt="The time that participants are willing to spend each role for the month"></div><br><br>  According to the schedule it is clear that with the proper formulation of the tasks, we have enough resources.  (Even in spite of the fact that people were marked immediately in different categories, proper management would use these resources wisely.). <br><br>  The total number of man-hours provided for the first month: 1068. Those.  approximately as much as 6 people give on the 8 hour working day. <br><br>  To determine the geographical distribution of a team, just look at their time zones: <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/88e9b888/d733ff71/a9de1460/159c312b.png" alt="Time zones of the project participants"></div><br><br>  Not only citizens of the Russian Federation took up the work. <br><br>  Key project ideas (there were several options to choose, I asked not to vote for the contradictory; I highlighted the key points; perhaps the text of the questions is a bit controversial, I apologize for this, do not throw stones): <ul><li>  We have to show them the actual consumption of resources (publish statistics of time spent) and show that the amount in the state.  orders overstated. <br>  Voted: 12 people (48%); </li><li>  We should not prove anything to anyone, but simply do something useful. <br>  Voted: 12 people (48%); </li><li>  <b>We must implement an advanced version of the current site Skolkovo (with its own additions).</b> <br>  Voted: 11 people (44%); </li><li>  <b>The project must be small (otherwise people will lose their motivation or we just will not master it).</b> <br>  Voted: 10 people (40%); </li><li>  The project can be great. <br>  Voted: 8 people (32%); </li><li>  We must implement a project that is not related to plans in Skolkovo. <br>  Voted: 8 people (32%); </li><li>  <b>We can take the IDE ready state.</b>  <b>project with poor implementation and make it in your vision (then you can, again, compare the costs.</b> <br>  Voted: 7 people (28%); </li><li>  In no case should we take the ideas of already implemented projects. <br>  Voted: 6 people (24%); </li><li>  We will show the real expense just like that, maybe someone will come in handy. <br>  Voted: 5 people (20%); </li><li>  We MUST take the IDE ready state.  project with poor implementation and make it in your vision to post a cost comparison. <br>  Voted: 4 people (16%). </li></ul><br><br>  Most showed a desire to remake the site i-gorod (where it all began), which at the same time falls under the category of small projects and under the processing of a bad public website. <br><br>  The only controversial question is: is it necessary to show your expenses or not to prove anything and implement a useful project?  It seems to me that the answer is simple: by itself, the publication of resources is already a useful idea and those who do not want to do this will not be affected in any way; <br><br>  In any case, the amount of resources may allow two projects to start in turn. <br><br><h4>  check in </h4>  We still need people.  If you want to join us, fill out the <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/dryga.com/viewform%3Fhl%3Dru%26formkey%3DdGZwaWI0aDRhaHRWaFpEN1RRTzJlX2c6MQ">form</a> and we will send you an e-mail with your username and password.  In particular, please respond to good logo makers, designers and PHP programmers.  There is an assumption that many will be eliminated precisely by professional skills and loss of interest in the project. <br><br><h4>  Other help </h4> We will be grateful to the media for publishing data about it.  Thanks to <a href="http://majorhost.net/">majorhost.net</a> for the kindly provided server. <br><br>  PS: No, the post is not paid by Google :). <br><br>  UPD.: For a couple of hours of post existence, the number of registered users has doubled (52 applications).  Now we have more than Google agrees to keep on itself.  We have to figure out how to fit all = (. <br><br>  UPD.: Sent access to all who climbed.  In the order of registration.  Some complained that the <b>letter got into spam</b> , be careful. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117508/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117508/</a></p>
