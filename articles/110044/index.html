  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Not only phones</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  All year we told you about consumer electronics: TVs, telephones and other washing machines.  By the end of the year, I would like to please the honorable public Habra with a story about a more ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù technique. <br><br>  In July, we already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/robot/99292/">told</a> you about how our robots-machine gunners defended the northern land borders of the Republic of Korea - along their entire 300-km perimeter.  There were no complaints about the robots, the exact number of which is a state secret, and if you have a question about where they were during the recent conflict, I will explain to you: shoot down surface-surface missiles from a machine gun (even if equipped with artificial intelligence) is quite problematic. <br><br>  Our special division Samsung Techwin, whose specialization is security and defense solutions, as well as aeronautics, automation and optoelectronics, deals with these not very true Terminator-like iron border guards.  By the way, about terminators and science fiction, this is the banner that greets <a href="http://www.samsungtechwin.com/">website</a> visitors.

Actually it all started with them.  Today, Samsung is one of the world leaders in the CCTV segment.  Over the past three decades, the German company Rollei was acquired and cooperation began with the Japanese Pentax (in 2005).  In 2008, Samsung Techwin cameras first entered the US security market.  On the official website, you can explore the entire CCTV product range - 11 categories and dozens of models in each.  Here, for example, is the novelty - the thermal camera SCB-9051, which sees 1.3 km in the dark. <br><br><img src="http://www.samsungtechwin.com/product/file_data/CTV/view_20100311_0_SCB-9051_FS.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There was cooperation with other companies and in other areas.  In 1980, together with General Electronics, the production of jet engines began.  In 1987, the production of helicopters began, and ten years later, the first South Korean KF-16 fighter (US F-16 Fighting Falcon under license) flew into the air.  But in 1999, this direction was curtailed, as the relevant divisions of Samsung, Daewoo and Hyundai were merged into the state corporation Korea Aerospace Industries. <br><br>  Consider what is being produced and offered today. <br><br>  <b>Artillery systems</b> <br><br>  1) Self-propelled howitzer installation (for 155-mm shells) <i>K9 Thunder</i> .  Developed since 1988, produced since 1999.  Weight - 47 tons.  Crew - 5 people.  The maximum speed of firing - 6-8 shells per minute.  The maximum range is 52-56 km.  The maximum speed is 67 km / h. <br><br>  In 2004, a contract was signed with the Turkish army, and the mass production of a modified version of the K9, called - T-155 Fƒ±rtƒ±na (9 tons heavier) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b6f/6f0/160/b6f6f0160ccb5684b5be00a1ca1c8ed6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  2) A <i>K10</i> ammunition replenishment machine capable of carrying up to 104 rounds was created on the K9 platform.  During the battle, the machine follows the artillery battery and replenishes the ammunition automatically. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/030/851/06e/03085106e71c8d0787074fa6d549eb4b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  3) Co-ordinating firing control systems (with a tactical battalion computer, a communications device and an automatic fire extinguishing system) and <i>Integrated Logistics Support</i> are included in this category based on artillery mounts. <br><br><img src="http://www.samsungtechwin.com/product/features/dep/ils_e/img/img01.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Fighting vehicles</b> <br><br>  1) The <i>KAAV</i> (Korea Amphibious Assault Vehicle) amphibious assault vehicle was built for the Marine Corps, and since then it has been modified and improved many times.  Today, the KAAV family is produced jointly by Samsung Techwin and the British BAE Systems. <br><br><img src="http://www.samsungtechwin.com/product/features/dep/kaav_e_new/img/aav7ai_01.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Different versions of KAAV differ from each other, first of all, in weight - from 21 to 24 tons (not loaded).  The maximum speed by land is 72 km / h, by water - 13 km / h.  BM can overcome trenches 2.4 m wide and walls 0.91 m high. Armed with 40-mm K4 grenade launcher, 12.7-mm K6 machine gun and smoke grenade launchers for the M257. <br><br>  2) <i>The Samsung armored multi-purpose wheeled vehicle</i> provides, above all, protection from mines, shells, machine guns and artillery (up to 155 mm) attacks on the infantry inside.  Mounted on top or 12.7-mm machine gun or 40-mm automatic grenade launcher.  It can also be installed tower, as in the tank. <br><br><img src="http://www.samsungtechwin.com/product/features/dep/mpv_e/img/img_01_03.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Other</b> <br><br>  1) Together with the American Simnet, a <i>system of solutions for military exercises</i> was developed, capable of calculating the complex tasks of logistics and combat.  Despite the complexity of the interface, the system also offers 3D simulations that bring it closer to computer games for clarity. <br><br><img src="http://www.samsungtechwin.com/product/features/dep/war_e/img/wargame.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://www.samsungtechwin.com/product/features/dep/war_e/img/img_01_01.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  2) <i>The combat training center</i> allows you to develop valuable skills without any threat to the lives of military personnel.  All shots and explosions are recorded only by lasers, after which through special sensors you are informed (approximately, as in the game of ‚Äúwarpieces‚Äù in childhood): ‚ÄúYou are killed.  Lie dead. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="http://www.samsungtechwin.com/product/features/dep/ctc_e/img/ctc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For such training, a whole range of weapons and combat equipment was recreated. <br><br><img src="http://www.samsungtechwin.com/product/features/dep/ctc_e/img/img_01_03.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  3) Together with the South Korean STX, <i>GPS-98K</i> coastal surveillance radars are produced.  They are able to transmit data and video to the command center in real time, and this does not happen all the time, but at the choice of the operator or automatically when an unusual movement of an unidentified object is detected. <br><br><img src="http://www.samsungtechwin.com/product/features/dep/radar_e/img/img_01_04.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  PS As you understand, consumer electronics and the military industrial complex are far from the only areas Samsung deals with.  We also build houses, ships, tower cranes, cars, do charity work, support culture and sports, and even sew fashionable clothes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110044/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110044/</a></p>
