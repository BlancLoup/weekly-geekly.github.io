Well, of course, I immediately wanted to do <s>collective farm tuning with</s> its modding.  There was a desire to do something, but could not think of anything.  A friend noticed a BMW in the yard.  I asked him about the angelic eyes, he said that he did not have them, dear ones.  From that moment I had a desire to make angel eyes. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  He made many designs, but they did not give the desired result.  As a result, I made 2 boards for each "eye", soldered SMD LEDs there with a safely soldered Chinese LED strip.  The choice was made - I decided to take the LEDs, as the real angel eyes are expensive for the price ... Moreover, we are not looking for easy ways. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5d0/a31/eea/5d0a31eea6b1037889eee4d9a387a86b.jpg">

      Alas, did not do worklog.  Because just show the end result. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c97/e31/854/c97e31854911fbfe28fac567cec2e5fc.jpg"><br><br>  I rode with these eyes a little over a year.  But, as a rule, every pilot of two-wheeled vehicles in the winter tries to improve his horse, that's why I decided to return to the modding of my scooter again.  There was an idea to modernize these ‚Äúangel eyes‚Äù.  He sat, scratched his head and beard, decided to make a small lotion with which these little eyes would blink.  Since programming is not strong, I turned for help to a friend who was involved in the creation of this <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/106746/">device</a> . <br><br>  We discussed what and how ... I gave those tasks with which it all started.  The idea was as follows: when turned on, the eyes light up smoothly, and then I can switch modes, which I originally invented 2: <br>  - eyes work in prophase <br>  - eyes in turn are lit <br><br>  Everything was implemented only in the proteus, then the line was behind me - to buy spare parts and make a printed circuit board.  With the help of LUT, I made a fee, bought parts, assembled, flashed, and debugged a friend of the firmware ‚Äî everything was fine.  But, as it turned out later, there was still enough memory in the controller and my mentality did not allow it not to be used, therefore another modification of this device followed.  In particular, several more modes have been added.  The author of the firmware, Alexey, suggested a small idea - with the dimensions off (not always evening), the possibility was added to someone to blink, say hello.  Actually it was possible not to do it, but biksenon (previously set) it became a pity to torment with constant flashes, because I lit up such manipulations with such manipulations.  Resolved - do it!  The firmware was brought to mind and the device earned.  It was also decided to add the third channel of ignition - for the dashboard and dimensions.  However, there is but - due to the use of ULN2003 chips rather than transistors, the current per channel was limited to 500mAh.  A microcircuit is a set of powerful composite keys with protective output diodes.  The presence of protective diodes allows you to connect inductive loads without additional protection against emissions of reverse voltage. <br><br>  I spread the scheme in principle: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/63c/36f/ebc/63c36febcbb5fb832b57e2c264faab63.jpg"><br><br>  And <a href="http://yadi.sk/d/kQNs0S440sVTg">firmware</a> in * .rom and * .hex formats. <br><br>  Also for demonstration I spread video (shot on phone).  There was an insatiable desire to collect everything as it should, put the wires, etc., but it was cold outside, it was cold in the garage ... he beat me ... <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/kxRI_7XjlnA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjnEmHWyFi2hEPjFybu-WJ1No_-wg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/160001/">https://habr.com/ru/post/160001/</a></p>
