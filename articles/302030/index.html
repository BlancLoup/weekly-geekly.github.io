  <section class="page js-page"><h1>They are not taken into programmers: "reverse engineering" of the person</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Surely, readers had to meet countless life hacking posts, articles, and even books on how to get to the position of a software developer, what to do to become a good developer, how to pass interviews to this position, and so on.  Moreover, there are statements like ‚Äúwhich tester would not want to become a developer‚Äù, ‚Äúa tester is a failed developer‚Äù, ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt know how to program, go to project managers‚Äù and so on. <br><br>  On this subject, a lot of reasoning, give recipes.  Due to the abundance of such dialogues among beginners, or even experienced specialists, stereotypes have emerged about the "chosenness" of developers, and in some circles a whole cult has formed.  It is clear that it is beneficial for developers to maintain this attitude towards themselves: not every coder will reach the middle of a deep debug.  Developing the theory of chosenness, some developers even came to the conclusion that the ‚Äúcoders‚Äù are not worthy of carrying the proud title of developer, putting them almost in line with computer operators. <br><br>  Because of this cult, many experts do not reveal their potential, trying to become just programmers, and not testers, project managers or support specialists.  Because of this maximalism, often young specialists generally leave the IT sphere, once having failed in the position of a software developer.

      For the sake of justice, we offer to look for alternative ways, opinions and recipes.  Perhaps this will push on certain insights of people seeking the truth or experiencing difficulties at the moment. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  To each according to his ability </h4><br>  Before you burn all the bridges, you can still give one last chance and sympathize with the IT industry, which needs personnel.  Especially acutely she lacks qualified professionals.  She is even ready to nourish them, cherish them in the cradle and teach them all the tricks. <br><br>  But since an IT company exists according to the rules of a team game, it is logical to assume that every team member is useful to her not just as a good person.  Each has its own set of abilities or already formed skills, which determines the place of the specialist in the company.  If someone is pedantic, diligent, has developed critical thinking, is an atheist and does not believe in the divine intent of the developer about a bug that is a feature, then the testing department will accept it with open arms. <br><br>  ‚ÄúBreak not to build,‚Äù say the developers.  So, there is no need for such a person to go to the development.  Just like a programming guru who enjoys his power, realizing his ideas, you should not go to testers. <br><br>  Therefore, when choosing one or another direction of development in IT, one should not put at the forefront all sorts of opinions of ‚Äúauthorities‚Äù and ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù people, the image of a particular specialization, the seeming ease or complexity of starting in it. <br><br>  But often the orientation of young people towards stereotypes and imaginary prestige still leads to a non-optimal choice of specialization. <br><br><h4>  5/2 emulation </h4><br>  Many resumes have such a section as business and personal qualities.  If a specialist has little experience, then the bet is placed on participation in competitions, achievements in studies and just on the above-mentioned section on quality.  Most applicants are tempted to write what they think the employer would like to hear. <br><br>  So, not only do they claim the position only because it is in trend, so also are the summaries, as they say web developers, "turnkey".  If they still get into the company, for example, to the position of a junior developer, then they have to continue to conform to what they have imagined themselves in the resume. <br><br>  Gradually, the situation turns into a psychological problem, not to mention a professional one.  But in the case of professional difficulties, things are not so straightforward, as the time bomb works here: the junior must have problems, because it is difficult to learn - it is easy in battle.  And after the end of the probationary period, the junior turns out to be ‚Äúat the broken trough,‚Äù without having learned anything.  Then you can, of course, be comforted by the thought that programming needs to learn not 5, but 10 years. <br><br>  To impersonate someone else is very difficult psychologically, even if a person believes that he really is.  Imagine: in order to emulate someone else's architecture, someone else's resource allocation scheme, someone else's algorithms and protocols for exchanging with the outside world, large computational powers are needed.  And more often than not, the first memory suffers. <br><br>  This simple analogy gives an idea that emulation in 5/2 mode is very expensive and not effective.  Moreover, we are still living people and we have the properties of being tired at work.  But a person may not even suspect that the cause of his professional failures is an energy overrun. <br><br>  To understand this, you need to at least once see your own ‚Äúnative procedures‚Äù in action, refer to the ‚Äúcore‚Äù of your personality.  But how to do this if we are born without the necessary manuals or at least some kind of readMe? <br><br>  A common recipe - you need to conduct a "reverse engineering" of your personality.  It is necessary to investigate the undocumented capabilities of its ‚Äúcore‚Äù. <br><br>  Communication without cuts can help with this: with peers or with more experienced people.  It is necessary to make a reservation that in this case this communication should be based on the extremely critical perception of what they say, on the search for not only pluses, but minuses.  It is even more important to try to try on themselves not only positive, but also their negative experience. <br><br><h4>  We decided not to postpone it indefinitely and asked a few questions to the specialists who had passed the stage of professional development. </h4><br>  <i><b>Michael, OTP System Administrator (for technical support)</b></i> <br><br>  <b>Have you started your career as a developer?</b>  <b>(well no)</b> <br><br>  Not.  Somehow I became interested in computers since school: all kinds of OS installations, programs, why games don't plow ... network setup.  And so it went - exit enikeyschik, sedentary enikeyschik, now it seems no longer quite enikeyschik, even the position is called - system administrator. <br><br>  <b>Why did you move / choose your current position?</b> <br><br>  Interesting local networks, work with a domain network.  Well, for the pieces of iron too - I remember changing the hard drive for the first time ... While there was no disk, I was loading from a floppy disk, I ran the toy from another floppy disk, I wrote letters to F4, and my sister then sent them at work. <br><br>  <b>What do you personally like about working at your current position?</b> <br><br>  A certain sense of significance, since in this position you are essentially helping colleagues to solve problems with computers. <br><br>  <b><i>Dmitry, Project Manager</i></b> <br><br>  <b>Have you started your career as a developer?</b>  <b>(well no)</b> <br><br>  Yes. <br><br>  <b>Why did you move / choose your current position?</b> <br><br>  For development, greater autonomy. <br><br>  <b>What do you personally like about working at your current position?</b> <br><br>  Flexible schedule, piece rate payment. <br><br>  <i><b>A software tester with a QA perspective who chose to remain anonymous</b></i> <br><br>  <b>Have you started your career as a developer?</b>  <b>(well no)</b> <br><br>  Not. <br><br>  <b>Why did you move / choose your current position?</b> <br><br>  Tried to get somewhere in IT.  When I came across a job vacancy testing, I tried it there.  From the first time they didn‚Äôt take it, but I liked the idea, so I continued training on testing and got settled. <br><br>  <b>What do you personally like about working at your current position?</b> <br><br>  Wide opportunities in development (there are no strict restrictions on the methods used, there is a possibility to influence processes in a reasoned way), projects close to interests, a qualified and adequate team, the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãimproving product quality and / or development processes. <br><br>  <i><b>Tonya, Project Manager</b></i> <br><br>  <b>Have you started your career as a developer?</b>  <b>(well no)</b> <br><br>  No, as a tester <br><br>  <b>Why did you move / choose your current position?</b> <br><br>  At the time of transition to this position, I just wanted to try myself in something new, just offered (before that I was a tester).  At that time there was no good understanding of the duties. <br><br>  <b>What do you personally like about working at your current position?</b> <br><br>  Communication with customers, finding out their needs and desires.  The ability to influence the development of the company's product.  Managing the development process.  Although I myself am not engaged in development, but due to communication with the team and solving current issues, I feel that I am not falling out of the area) <br><br>  <i><b>Sergey, Product manager - Team lead</b></i> <br><br>  <b>Have you started your career as a developer?</b>  <b>(well no)</b> <br><br>  Yes. <br><br>  <b>Why did you move / choose your current position?</b> <br><br>  There was a desire, and the management provided such an opportunity. <br><br>  <b>What do you personally like about working at your current position?</b> <br><br>  A big role in the life of the product (I think a lot, decide, coordinate, know everything).  True, I miss programming a bit, but not really. <br><br>  Why did I choose a position in the field of software development, then here it is simple - ‚Äúwhat I can do and what I like is what I do.‚Äù <br><br>  <i><b>Maxim, software developer</b></i> <br><br>  <b>Have you started your career as a developer?</b>  <b>(well no)</b> <br><br>  Yes. <br><br>  <b>Why did you move / choose your current position?</b> <br><br>  Interest in programming, complex tasks and the thrill of their decision. <br><br>  <b>What do you personally like about working at your current position?</b> <br><br>  Interesting tasks, interesting salary. <br><br>  <i><b>Danil, software developer</b></i> <br><br>  <b>Have you started your career as a developer?</b>  <b>(well no)</b> <br><br>  Yes. <br><br>  <b>Why did you move / choose your current position?</b> <br><br>  Yes, as if by profession and like in general :) <br><br>  <b>What do you personally like about working at your current position?</b> <br><br>  Like to develop products in different programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand using modern tools. <br><br><ul><li><h5>  It is worth noting that the answers of the developers in this case are quite simple.  One might say, they were lucky: the external values ‚Äã‚Äãand orientation of the environment coincided with their abilities, hobbies and psychological features. </h5></li><li><h5>  But the rest did not see for themselves the possibility of growth in the transition to the position of the developer.  At the same time, they were guided by their personal considerations, without paying much attention to stereotypes in certain circles. </h5></li></ul><br><br><h4>  Reverse Engineering Personality </h4><br>  The starting point in this process can serve as an honest resume writing "without the Grammy and the Oscars."  It is also useful to answer questions like ‚Äúwhat would I choose if there was another specialization in the mod?‚Äù Or ‚Äúwhat would I choose if I didn't need to make money?‚Äù. <br><br>  In addition to the questions, a situation can be asked: if you were given $ 1 megaliard of investment, gave a good CEO and were instructed to come up with a startup and work in it.  In what area could this startup work?  And most importantly - what tasks as an IT specialist would you like to solve there?  How would you rate your prospects as an employee of this company?  Where would you like to develop? <br><br>  Questions and situations can be many.  It is important to destroy the distorted perception of reality and to free oneself from the conditioning of this distorted reality. <br><br>  From the future, you are heading straight into the past: comparing your own and others' experiences, you can pick out some break points in your biography - the stages at which an important choice was made with your heart creaked, influenced by the desire to please someone, the fear of standing out, or the banal laziness. <br><br>  Most likely, it is worth looking for in high school and in the university.  This is done in order to understand how the sequence of suboptimal decisions has knocked you from professional guidelines, without providing an opportunity for your truly strong points to emerge. <br><br>  Then you return to the future, answer questions or model situations anew.  Then again into the past and so on. <br><br>  Such an iterative scheme will gradually lead you to the core of your personality.  After this, it will only be necessary to run the Build command: recompile the perception of the present, rebuild the personality, register new paths, dependencies, connections, and redistribute resources. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> Whatever the stereotypes and opinions of the ‚Äúauthorities‚Äù, everything may change tomorrow.  But if a person is interested in the IT industry, he will look for a place in it.  No one is immune from mistakes, but it is quite possible to make a ‚Äúvaccination‚Äù against maximalism, idolatry, superficiality and blind adherence to someone else‚Äôs opinion. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302030/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302030/</a></p>
