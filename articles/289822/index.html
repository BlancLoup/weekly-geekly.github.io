This project is an alternative to the proposal of the Russian Union of right holders for global licensing and taxation of licensed content from telecom operators, and consequently, from users of the Network.  In general, this idea was met more warmly than the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa global license (RSP led by Nikita Mikhalkov), but this project was not yet fully approved by the expert group. <br><br>  It is worth recalling that the expert group of the public chamber includes representatives of Internet providers, Internet companies, copyright holders, the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Economy, the State Duma.  The catalog initiative itself was developed by the OP with the participation of federal telecom operators: VimpelCom, MegaFon and MTS.  The essence of the idea is the creation of a catalog of intellectual property products, which will store data on the rights holders and content, the rights to which belong to them.  In order to get into such a register, the right holder must submit an application, with a further process of identification (using electronic digital signature).  The functions of monitoring and editing the catalog are supposed to be entrusted to the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media, Roskomnadzor, companies with 100% state participation or an accredited collective rights management organization (the latter is rated by the group as the least desirable). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In addition, simultaneously with the creation and introduction of the catalog, it is planned to simplify the legislation in terms of stimulating the processes of buying and selling copyright.  According to the authors of the project, the information of the general catalog allows subjects and objects of copyright law to interact with each other.  So, content aggregators, users or third-party companies will be able to directly go to the right holders, and enter into appropriate agreements on the use of content.

      The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a single catalog has several beneficial features from the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe RSP, headed by Nikita Mikhalkov.  For example, in this project it is not required to introduce a general collection from telecom operators.  The total amount of funds received from such a fee would be 21 billion rubles.  in year.  The cost of creating a digital catalog is only about 100 million rubles, according to Andrei Kolesnikov, director of the Coordination Center of the national domain of the Internet network.  ‚ÄúWith this money, in order to ensure reliability, two geographically distributed systems can be built with a mechanism for balancing traffic between them and with regional nodes - for caching information, in order to reduce the response time to requests,‚Äù Kolesnikov commented on the situation. <br><br>  According to the director of "MegaFon" on relations with government agencies Dmitry Petrov, the main function of the registry can be to determine the amount of content that is subject to accounting and regulation. <br><br>  However, the project of creating such a catalog has negative charts.  The main concerns about this were expressed by the representatives of ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù and ‚ÄúRambler &amp; Co‚Äù. <br><br>  The negative consequence is the introduction of a mechanism of pre-trial blocking of resources by telecom operators.  ‚ÄúSuch a practice can have extremely negative consequences for the Internet as a whole,‚Äù they believe in Yandex. <br><br>  Representatives of the company "Rambler &amp; Co" agree with their colleagues.  Thus, Matvey Alekseev, director of external communications, believes that pre-trial blocking at the request of rights holders registered in the catalog will be the third option to block sites on the Web.  Accordingly, the system will work opaque, and provide opportunities for abuse. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289822/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289822/</a></p>
