And going to work every day was quite unbearable.  It was enough for me for half a year :) Therefore, in spite of not dusty work, a very high salary, but by the standards of yesterday‚Äôs student, which is generally chic, I waited for the first sracha with my superiors and slammed the door beautifully.  Since then I entertain myself and enjoy life.  I want to tell you about the nuances of the free life of a former electronics freelancer in this post. <br>  All of the following is exclusively my practical experience and I am not sure that everything will work out exactly with you. <br><br>  <b>Salvage</b> <br>  I'll start with the most interesting, with money.  Let's just say, at the end of my activity (approximately 2010), without really straining, working about two or three days a week, you could safely make thousands of 50-70 rubles.  This is in Chelyabinsk.  If you work every day, it was easy to do from 150 thousand rubles a month or more, but for this I was too lazy.  And now in order. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>Who is customer</b> <br>  Usually these are enterprises that need to solve a small problem in the field of automating any trifles or to bring a unit back to life.  They themselves do not understand electronics, and often cannot formulate an intelligible TK.  They need to just work. <br>  Often all kinds of mass media entertainers who needed to organize specific electronics for a show were often approached. <br><br>  Every client is expensive and his illiteracy and sometimes strange inquiries are not offended.  In the end, he pays for it. <br><br>  After the explanation of the TZ on the fingers begins, the elucidation of details and the creation of an already full-fledged TZ, describing the maximum details, begins.  Especially if the work on the remote. <br>  Sometimes I got offices engaged in development.  They already had a clear and detailed TK, no more no less.  They just didn‚Äôt want to do it and they tried to outsource it.  These I sent to the garden.  Let them look for cheap labor elsewhere. <br><br>  Sometimes strange people come across.  For example, those who naively believe that it is cheaper to develop a car stereo with MP3 in a car than to buy it in a store. <br><br>  <b>The level of projects and their evaluation</b> <br>  There is an opinion that it would be cool for a freelancer to grab some hellish complex order for 100.5 million money, methodically to start shoveling it and to raise its financial position with it, having broken the big sum. <br><br>  The opinion is erroneous, because  except heaps of hemorrhoids, it will not bring anything.  Such orders, as a rule, are ambiguous, have a bunch of pitfalls, a huge burden of responsibility, and a bunch of paperwork to boot.  You meet him for long months, without the possibility of escaping.  To pull off this strap alone is difficult, and most importantly not.  If a wolf clogs up an elephant, then it is unlikely that he will eat it, the elephant will quickly become rotten.  Much more effective to catch hares and mice.  And it also provides a pleasant opportunity at any time to score and relax as much as you want. <br><br>  So I only took on such a project that could have done two unhurried work in a day.  Such a project, the full one hundred percent implementation of which I saw in my head immediately after voicing the TK. <br><br>  Usually consisted of a power supply, controller, logic, strapping, and one of the standard plastic enclosures.  To speed up the development, a specialized de-payment Pinboard was developed, now it has already a second reincarnation and is being sold as an independent product.  Who was on my <a href="http://easyelectronics.ru/">site</a> , he knows. <br><br>  To accelerate the design, all typical nodes, such as power stabilizers, microcontrollers with strapping, key drivers, all relay switching, were already pre-set and ready.  As a result, the circuit board was assembled as from a designer.  I threw on the board the templates of already divorced units, and connected them with tracks, by necessity reigning small details.  Thus, the development of the PCB took me from 10 minutes to several hours, no more.  Programming is even easier.  Because  The tasks are simple, then the code is there at the level of the amateur arduinschik <br><br>  Now the main thing about the evaluation of the order.  The forums and comments often flies such a criterion for assessing the value: <br><br>  ‚ÄúYou estimate the cost of the package, add to it the cost of an hour of your work, multiplied by the number of hours spent.  Something like this". <br><br>  Gentlemen, get rid of this shit!  You are no longer employees to count your work hours.  The hour of your work is only the cost, according to this formula you will consider the work of hired employees when you have them.  And it is necessary to work in profit. <br><br>  Therefore, it is necessary to consider the cost of the decision.  And the price will be exactly as much as the customer is willing to pay for it.  Because  Since I was mainly connected with industrial electronics, I had a lot of orders from there, for various small automatics.  I will give a couple of simple examples: <br><br>  The controller controls the shop door, or rather the sly drive of twin doors that had to be opened and closed in a certain order.  All that was needed there was to organize the simplest logic.  Any office on automation would have hung in there some sort of entry-level PLC, like the DL-05, which in itself costs 15 thousand, and even piled up a box with a power supply and a lot of attendants for work, programming and installation.  It would cost thousands in 60, no less.  And I made them a smart box for the top ten, they already assembled it themselves. <br><br>  A machine part breaks down, for example a keyboard controller.  There is not much work to do - make a survey of the matrix keyboard and even a schoolboy can issue key codes to the RS232.  It would seem that working for a couple of days for what to take there? <br>  But you can't buy this keyboard in the store.  The machine itself is worth a couple of million euros, spare parts for it are also very curly.  To order from the officials is a few thousand dollars and wait a couple of months.  And it happens that the company that produced the machine no longer exists. <br>  Every day idle machine costs the customer a large amount.  He loses his profit, reputation, moreover, his workers are idle, but they continue to pay wages - direct losses. <br>  And then I appear and say that I will solve their problem in two days.  Here you can request a couple of hundred thousand for solving the problem.  And zazhlobitsya, so let him find someone will make faster and cheaper. <br>  Electronics engineers, unlike web designers, are few and need to be found.  He left the phone and after a couple of days, having estimated the scale of the disaster, the client usually called back.  :) Of course, you need to have a reputation and recommendations, but more on that later. <br><br>  In general, in this market it is necessary to clearly understand the price of the solution, as well as the benefits it brings to the customer.  The presence of competitors, the prices of potential competitors, lead time and a bunch of different factors.  For the sake of interest, you can terrorize competitors (better than firms that are engaged in development) for the cost of a turnkey solution for any task.  Prices are usually space there.  Still, they have to feed staff, accounting, office rent of everyones.  Yes, and they work in 99% of the finished glands like the same standard PLC, which themselves are not cheap toys. <br><br>  Here is the approximate level of orders that came to memory: <br>  1) Atelier autotuning.  It was necessary to make the controller dynamic illumination of the bottom of the car.  So that when you press the gas, the color changes from blue to red smoothly.  Installation - their problems, with me only fee.  Hall sensors, magnets on a rope, tini2313, field device.  Two days of work (together with the prototype) and about 8 thousand for each copy of the board. <br><br>  2) What is the factory.  It is necessary to make the controller of the relay, instead of their serially produced (because they have on the shovel mikrah, and nowhere to get them).  7seg indicator, three buttons.  Relyushki button, turn on button, turn off button.  Relyushki powered through ULN2003, made a feeder for ms34068, provided a bonus for connecting to a computer via USB or RS232 (there was a place on the board, why not stick it).  Together with the prototype managed in 5 hours.  Put in his pocket 15 thousand.  An unexpected feature with the connection to the computer the customer was extremely happy. <br><br>  3) Workshop door controller.  I pressed the button, the doors opened in the correct order (relay, control the factory drive), reached the limit switch - closed.  At the same time, a sound signal is given and the number of the door being opened is sent to the console.  Work for the day.  10yr. <br><br>  4) Controller unwinding drums.  8 drums with cables, five limit switches responsible for tension.  When the operator drags the free end of the cable, the limit switch is triggered and the desired drum should start unwinding.  Along the way, switch control to 8 engines from one frequency drive.  Made in 4 days, taking into account the ride in the comb behind the box and starters.  The scheme itself riveted over the evening.  Even the evening with a Dremel cut holes under the buttons in a drawer and mounted everything.  Day on site installation.  40 thousand.  Bargained. <br><br>  5) Encoder converter to tacho signal in order to put a modern engine on an old machine.  Processing of the optical encoder, on the MK, at the output of the filtered pwm.  Managed for a week (because there were tricky losses that surfaced during the launch) earned about 30yr.  Also an unsuccessful order. <br><br>  6) Weight control system.  Forklifts are propelled by a huge warehouse and load the carriage standing on the scales.  It was necessary to duplicate the weight from the tabla to the identifiers inside each loader.  I took the weight from the tabla via RS232, there was a standard output.  Further processed the controller and kicked over the radio.  There really was fun.  The object is closed, so there you just can not get, according to the customer: "Thirty meters, in a straight line."  In fact, it turned out to be almost a kilometer and after several railway trains.  I had to spend a fucking cloud of time on experimenting with the modules, and as a result we built an infernal antenna on the roof of the weighing box that broke through everything.  65 thousand. <br><br>  7) It took the customer to hack the PLC of the cutting machine to fix the program.  Because  It was too long and expensive to call a delegation of Chinese specialists.  PLC protection is usually childish.  Others so the program client password in the clear RS232 and send :).  Hacked for 30 minutes picking with ComPort Monitor.  Took cheap, about 10yr, because  by friendship. <br><br>  A separate category of orders is a serial product.  If you need to develop something on a small series, then it is a completely different cymes.  The task is many times more difficult, because  It will be necessary to take into account a bunch of different factors.  Such as manufacturability assembly, production technology and installation, quality control, and better self-test system.  The range of components used by the enterprise, as well as ways to reduce it.  Take into account the mountain of documentation that will have to be prepared.  So even over a simple device will have to break the head.  It is expensive and not as simple as it seems at first glance.  I usually refuse, crap too much. <br><br>  Well, the most fun when the customer is ready to take your products in batches.  Just manage to ship.  Here, all of the above, only the fee is smeared on the lot, assemblers are hired and you get your own production.  The main thing here - do not try to do it yourself.  Dead room.  You will kill a lot of strength, lose all motivation, and earn disproportionately little.  Established, launched and let the workers work.  Only periodically you control quality and break your head over another task.  The only way. <br><br>  <b>Where does the client come from</b> <br>  This is all of course cool, but many will ask, and where to get orders?  And here's another fun thing.  It is not enough to be an expert, you still need to be able to sell your skills and sell at a high price.  You need to make a name for yourself and reputation.  And you need to be able to see, hear and think very quickly.  Orient not only in the OM, but also fluently in everything that applies to it. <br><br>  The tangible part of orders was thrown at me from various industries, by an old friendship even when I was a repairman in industrial equipment.  Several fatty orders picked up almost on the street.  I hear a man at the bus stop discussing that he cannot solve the problem.  Well, almost all TZ openly laid out.  I warmed my ears and imposed myself :) Also, it would not hurt to make a deal with all the radio shops.  Because  very many of the problem go there.  And if the seller all forwards to you, then this is another source of orders. <br><br>  However, all this is complete garbage compared to the Internet.  This is where the abyss of work.  Any freelance exchanges will not help here, you have to make yourself.  Actively and competently PR.  So, to the question ‚ÄúWho would develop electronics,‚Äù even a person who was far from the topic had the answer ‚ÄúAnd there‚Äôs such a guy here ...‚Äù. <br><br>  So do the sites of the Lord.  And do not just do it, but share your knowledge there.  From the site portfolio "I and my <strike>shitty cats</strike> appliances" little sense.  By the way, there are a lot of them.  But who cares?  Do you remember even one if you are suddenly asked? <br><br>  And you need to attract hundreds, and preferably thousands of visitors.  Nothing is easier, in fact.  Show me the work process.  Subtleties, details.  No need to invent and give birth to topics. <br><br>  Describe what you are working on now.  Communicate, help others.  And this is not a waste of time.  Showing what you do, how you do it, why you do it and how you don‚Äôt need it, you set a point of support.  Impose your notion of the right thing. <br><br>  Of course, frank crap is not a ride, but even if you are mistaken in some way, then who can argue with that?  And if you challenge, then who will hear him?  Thus, you will seriously expand the scope of potential customers.  Stop being a cat in a bag, you will have a reputation which should be valued, which means that the level of trust in your person will grow simply radically. <br><br>  There is no need to go far for well-known examples of such an approach to PR.  Lebedev Studio is certainly not the only studio in Russia that makes high-quality design.  But everyone knows Lebedev.  And not least because of his site, which is full of valuable info on design, how to do it and how to do it, various jokes and interesting things are not only designers, but also in principle a wide circle of visitors. <br><br>  A few months after lifting easyelectronics.ru, the customer simply went jamb, so you could even pick them up.  Most of the quite adequate orders I just flogged towards the familiar developers.  Because  I had neither the time nor the desire to do them.  And then completely removed from everywhere information that I was doing something to order. <br><br>  <b>Features of remote work</b> <br>  Although electronics development often requires an on-site presence, remote work is possible.  The truth requires more wiggling and a more meticulous approach to TK.  In some cases, you can even conduct remote debugging.  For example, steering through Ethernet-RS232 with your device and watching via Skype video conferencing.  And when executing working prototypes, protection against scam, which, alas, is not uncommon in our realities, can be done using various cunning methods.  For example, upload a limited demo to the controller, and then, after checking its operation and receiving money, send the already properly stitched controller.  DIP enclosures in the panels they rule!  Either make a special track or jumper that the user himself cuts after payment. <br><br>  <b>Papers and design</b> <br>  Definitely make out for yourself at least IP.  Because  Most of the customers are enterprises, and even they are not particularly friendly with cash, let alone any wrappers like webmans.  Only clearing, only hardcore.  Hemorrhoids with PI minimum.  The tax system is optimally the entire USN 6% and the web service of electronic accounting, of which there are now several.  From the point of view of the enterprise, with such small orders, it is increasingly being issued as a purchase of equipment or as a service.  So usually everything is simple. <br><br>  <b>ZY</b> <br>  And why the <b>former</b> electronics freelancer?  It's simple, I'm tired of customers, other people's hardware and I opened my own production.  This is much nicer, no deadlines, no customers.  Much more free time and at times less responsibility.  There was a successful crowdsourcing, and jokes with the selection of personnel, troubles with suppliers, the creation of a warehouse, accounting komplektuhi, turnover, and its subtleties.  But that's another story.  Someday I will tell her too. <br><br>  <b>ZZY</b> <br>  Although I have deleted everywhere that I work on an order, but for the old memory, people periodically constantly come to me.  Sometimes up to several per day.  But I don‚Äôt take them anymore, I give them away from my acquaintances.  I can share with you if there is any sane portfolio showing the level of development.  Agree on the amount, conditions and TK with the client themselves, I just redirect.  As a reward, I want 5% of the transaction, unless of course it happens.  I don‚Äôt control it, everything is for honesty, but from whom more money comes to me, more orders get :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/148665/">https://habr.com/ru/post/148665/</a></p>
