This is the first picnic in the "winter" format. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/adc/8d5/fee/adc8d5fee363b3266536832581188e5e.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  Here you can see a zoned version, it is worth it: <a href="http://zoom.it/Ede4">zoom.it/Ede4</a> <br><br>  I could not miss such an event and of course I went there.  In short, there are interesting things (and many), but the organization is bad.  And a lot, a lot of people.  If in detail - under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first really cool object on the territory of the All-Russian Exhibition Center was the slide.  No not like this.  GORKA! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f0c/f35/48d/f0cf3548da745a42370ee9be85499b57.jpg" alt="image"><br>  She, by the way, has not disappeared anywhere, which cannot be said about GeekPicnic itself. <br>  At the entrance - a huge queue at the entrance.  And the queue for tickets even more, so it was best to buy them on the site in advance.  Till the 25th, a ticket for one person cost 500 rubles, then (and at the entrance) - 750 rubles. <br>  After checking the ticket, people are caught and stamped on the arm: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5c2/cd7/6c3/5c2cd76c3cf77b7f49240666e4e1f998.jpg" alt="image"><br>  She is a pass to the exhibition both days.  Welcome! <br><br><h4>  What was there? <br></h4> For example, hand casts: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a47/0cb/3bb/a470cb3bbb47cdd6abe8b2c39486ef5e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  From wax.  True, I did not find the process itself, but the result is this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/98e/9bb/2e1/98e9bb2e1079472bdd5138c2e42e8712.jpg" alt="image">

      There were all kinds of flying machines.  Large copters: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fe0/f9e/183/fe0f9e18360047c7e8aaf6869e5ee9b7.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And round copters: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/813/16f/692/81316f6928515614f29f85f95063be3e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Aircraft: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6de/4cd/af8/6de4cdaf89c29fc895dfc5a8431dd898.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And big planes: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b6/534/766/6b6534766d8b1318d2a7457fb64fc4cf.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Aircraft, unfortunately, and stood all the time in the form of museum specimens.  But the copters flew, and quite actively. <br><br>  There was a steampunk corner: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c21/8f3/cef/c218f3ceff03b2bbaafebd0b49b96472.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Opinion around which was divided into two diametrically opposed groups: ‚Äúsome kind of crap, go from here‚Äù and ‚Äúwow, steampunk !!!‚Äù <br>  But the girl did not leave anyone indifferent.  True, she always ran back and forth, so I don‚Äôt have a single non-blurry photo. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/41f/8a8/8e7/41f8a88e7ff8f686e0ca7c35084ec9ae.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Steampunk flash drives from Alexey Sigaev: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de9/e63/e2c/de9e63e2cc090d4280d0eb6f33b86716.jpg" alt="image"><br>  But what it is, I did not fully understand: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/953/118/208/953118208b23bd1ede5c38de747fa400.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There were a variety of machines (operating and not).  For example, <a href="http://www.fablab77.ru/">FabLab</a> brought a laser cutting machine for wood, he cut key chains: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/959/fc5/6cb/959fc56cbefac19de5cd0373f6a79942.jpg" alt="image"><br>  There were small mills: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/598/d24/075/598d24075aca2c28fbace77bcf511eb5.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And big mills: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a8f/b84/007/a8fb840070407465909a13bf9ceda63c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The material for which served no less, these are the boards: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eb5/928/0c4/eb59280c4f1a560687bc7f6feacaec02.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Here is such a thing he cut these sheets: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/142/477/ebd/142477ebdd139549be996dedf94255c7.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And the parts after the assembly turned into such chairs, which they sold for 1000 rubles: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e68/4cd/e96/e684cde961d9f0e3718cc7f361b33cb7.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Some brutal control buttons: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/072/b35/90c/072b3590c32010b72023931ed4287341.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And here is what waste looks like from it: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/df7/2f3/aa5/df72f3aa54e6fb680f5f0b6570960cbe.jpg" alt="image"><br>  They can even make these pretty beds with a strongly curved surface: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a80/e59/4ef/a80e594ef7619ceb9bf3b72b6ed49c4e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Such a bend is achieved by tricky cutting: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/358/eb9/3d9/358eb93d94ac9e5e05a8f65d029e6d42.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Well, you already want such a machine yourself home? <br><br>  Of course, there were a lot of 3d printers.  Lots of.  You do not know what to bring to the exhibition - bring a 3d printer! <br>  I finally saw the delta printer live: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f93/a47/068/f93a47068bb58003b8b36b333127c1b3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Paper printer: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fce/265/e3c/fce265e3c736fa2b0456a46b2017f3f8.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Workspace: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ae4/49c/20f/ae449c20f682997e57faf30aceea93d6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  I will not show here photos of printers that are already seen, ok?  I'd rather show 3d scanning: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/205/bc8/b45/205bc8b45efa06f2e2b14e0d54436c06.gif" alt="image"><br>  True, the quality of this scan leaves much to be desired: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/504/18a/a12/50418aa126608c2620e8cd163e7be948.jpg" alt="image"><br>  As I explained, this is due to non-studio conditions.  In any case, after such scanning and processing, you can print out such a figure from plaster or paper: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/10d/b24/c8d/10db24c8d18b5e5380646b2764dfa994.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Oh, not that photo.  Here is the right one: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/26f/7fc/47e/26f7fc47e48eb3fc7ce06d76b0727474.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The figures are cool, heavy and pleasant.  But I can‚Äôt think of applying them except on the top of the wedding cake.  The cost of creating such a figure (scanning, processing, printing) - 13k.  Cost of printing - 4k. <br>  Showed printed prostheses: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/517/c19/dff/517c19dffba472bd0b12bfe1c78ef60b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Pony (where without pony?): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f3b/1bd/2bb/f3b1bd2bb07f700094b3099956ca2879.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Print yourself bleat! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e86/5b7/013/e865b7013630c50d0fe9ef9c9d5895b7.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Articulated dolls: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/707/9d4/870/7079d48708543d5ca63213064a04a0f5.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Metal parts: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b6/90a/6e1/7b690a6e1c5b025d249de5ac92b5638d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In the booth with a modest inscription, 18+ showed pistols: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/048/e8f/6f5/048e8f6f57dff40e3d8543970a4bfd72.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And not only pistols: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/597/ea4/b47/597ea4b47fe5a0aeb4b0bdbeac434344.jpg" alt="image"><br>  On this optimistic note, we will close the topic of 3D printing. <br>  Guys on electric bicycles rode around the hall: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/98e/93a/67d/98e93a67d0fa0a518a16cd4477348b9b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And girls on segway: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/03b/915/f92/03b915f92ccd23c965566a9d4f141491.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Adherents of crippling tried to find neophytes: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c79/8e6/468/c798e646892bdabe6f469cefc7c39b02.jpg" alt="image"><br>  A token for 360k :) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c67/b40/3db/c67b403db35c791cc16a3e1fe396291f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  They sold kits from 23andMe for some not very adequate prices: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d1f/f5a/085/d1ff5a085727fb892d69ba4b841dafda.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Have shown necomini ears: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/899/6d4/b0c/8996d4b0cf9ef003415011af15e74acb.jpg" alt="image"><br>  We offered everyone to sit on a chair with nails: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/70e/806/528/70e806528647132484da13a8014c6072.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Printed photos from Instagram with a specific hash tag: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b0e/3f3/36f/b0e3f336f286791cfca31233c9b788ac.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Have arranged Angry Birds live: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a06/777/144/a06777144ef2f7223ab9ef1fffee1108.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Showed on the projector Benq logo with a flirty skirt: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f37/827/1fa/f378271fa838e82d401bf30ac44b7df3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  They tried to play music on Tesla, but it turned out loud, but not very impressive.  Because of the huge crowd, nothing was really visible. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d8f/150/6f2/d8f1506f26dd993d3567c4bcd3bccdd1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Alfa-Bank made a place to rest and to charge the phones - brilliant! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9c5/923/7ea/9c59237eac65d32d49d34e5390622de0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the plc demonstrated auto-car wash (automatic car wash): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6c7/3c2/d81/6c73c2d81ae49dda60f31b080ca42a0e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And here is the controller itself.  In theory, he has no difference, control a toy car wash, or a big one: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c3c/df8/811/c3cdf8811a1dab2f3a44e402030ba122.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There were big robots: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/501/f86/1b7/501f861b77a3e1950fc70c26377fe389.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And small: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/921/c60/bb4/921c60bb4cce957978b77b1b7efe68cd.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And very small: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7e6/716/061/7e67160619b2a9277172e0739996be7a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  There was a sad robot: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/add/b53/029/addb5302931d573e9bb209ea5539df35.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Who constantly repaired: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4c1/75c/0d0/4c175c0d0d7b30b23c52e91fe320521f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And there was a robot that no longer needed to be repaired: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6c8/0b1/63a/6c80b163a13fa9ba476ad6dd277ca6cf.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In fact, this is an " <a href="http://www.maket-online.ru/">interactive layout</a> " that should look like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c76/891/1b8/c768911b803a34aa5877ff0e81774cdf.jpg" alt="image"><br>  There was a robot that you could try to program yourself: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/457/af4/045/457af4045db56d3b3698e17f86eebf83.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Although ‚Äúprogrammed‚Äù is a loud word.  To draw the program: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/77b/a49/110/77ba4911018bb7be77abc20d517d5fd0.jpg" alt="image"><br>  There was a robot hand that repeated the movements of a person, determining his position through LeapMotion: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/405/a41/530/405a41530dfe3829f5674dd00dec2199.jpg" alt="image"><br>  This is the only real LeapMotion application I saw. <br><br>  People were playing with toys on the display hanging in the air.  From the side you look, nothing is clear, poke your fingers into the ultrasonic humidifier: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/285/917/38c/28591738ce24d093bb790843d9ed6dd8.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And then you look, and you understand that the humidifier is not simple.

It consisted of the Soviet gaming machines: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/32e/94c/64c/32e94c64ccda1c6dcf6b7e96fba5eb70.jpg" alt="image"><br>  To which lined up line: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0e9/253/870/0e9253870d6afe25f469979ddd6df474.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And a few xboxes that were empty: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/81c/e57/89e/81ce5789e08953eaece4fc56df419416.jpg" alt="image"><br>  For fans of this old school worked game store: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a4/a2b/65e/4a4a2b65e1c853b33ca3ed93f38274d7.jpg" alt="image"><br>  For missing on TV - silent cinema: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8a1/712/30b/8a171230b6c24d118187275141b5e423.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Put on wireless headphones and watch the faded movie: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/869/fe3/e09/869fe3e099bcd8d330c0f64cfdca8e7a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  And now about the bad <br></h4>  Pavilion 57, though large, but by the evening of the first day the people were too many to comfortably move around the exposition.  It looked like this: you come up to the table, there is such a huge line there, that it‚Äôs not very clear what they show there.  Working with your elbows, you squeeze to the table, you understand that there is something not very interesting there, for example, a regular 3D printer.  Ok, just working elbows out of the crowd around the table, and go to the next bunch of people, inside which the next table is hidden. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b53/e0c/1c4/b53e0c1c42777e93dde2c08df3732ec4.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The most bad thing in my opinion is that it was impossible to understand who and where is shown.  There were no exhibition cards (perhaps they were, but they did not stand in the hall, they were not handed out with tickets, and I did not find them on the site), or even just the names of the stands at such a height that they would not cover the heads of them. <br>  Later, I guessed to get to the second floor, and look at the top (first photo), and it immediately became clearer. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fd8/a65/12e/fd8a6512e27b1c25edc558d94f5862b4.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The second disadvantage is the poor organization of the racks.  More precisely, there were no racks - in most cases, their role was played by ordinary tables, rather shabby and unstable. <br>  For those who sold something, the cost of participation was 50k, with its counter - 30k. <br>  The cost of a food court is 150k. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/122/373/f04/122373f045eea32f5e219bb160653398.png" alt="image"><br>  It still seems to me that for this money it was possible to provide for the participants something more than ordinary tables. <br>  Moreover, in the summer at the exhibition (I do not remember the name, some kind of abbreviation) of student projects in the same pavilion there was quite a decent organization of space: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e58/85e/5ce/e5885e5cea2249d873b7bee1c9babc6b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Why was it impossible to do this? <br><br><h4>  Comment by Nikolay Belousov (@ ni404) - founder of Madrobots <br></h4>  Geekpicnic is obviously an established brand.  On the first day several tens of thousands of people came.  The scale of the event is impressive and today it is the largest exhibition about technology in Russia. <br>  Subconsciously, I was constantly drawn to compare Geekpicnic with CES, but I stopped myself in time. <br>  Since the comparison is clearly not in favor of Geekpicnic. I hope Geek Picnic is still ahead. <br><br><h5>  What was good and interesting <br></h5><ul><li>  a large number of companies from the field of 3D printing </li><li>  shops with an interesting assortment (for example, the photo album "Time Machine" from the store vot-tak.com) </li><li>  a lot of robot developers </li></ul><br><br><h5>  disadvantages <br></h5><ul><li>  No zoning space. <br>  Events and performances created an incredible roar.  Stands that were present in the immediate vicinity of the scene, were attacked by crowds of people. </li><li>  Low quality stands. <br>  Many projects did not even have signatures to the demonstrated developments and roll-ups where they could read about their company. <br>  The exhibits were displayed on ordinary wooden desks that trembled at every touch. <br>  During the speeches, people climbed to the stands and desks, breaking them. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7e5/485/101/7e548510192e3045e7e5e0d846dcb71f.jpg" alt="image"><br></li><li>  Unprocessed traffic flows <br>  Due to too dense placement of stands, people crowded and piled on exhibits. <br>  It was impossible to walk past the booth during rush hours or to get closer. <br>  According to eyewitnesses, the queue at the entrance at the time of opening reached an hour of time.  This is for those who have not bought a ticket in advance. <br>  Small life hacking: I bought a ticket in 2 minutes from my mobile phone, having paid for the ticket through Paypal and avoided the half-hour queue before buying tickets. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  TOP 5 products on GeekPicnic according to Nikolay Belousov <br></h4><br><h5>  3D printers Cube <br></h5>  SIU System is a distributor of 3D Systems, which manufactures Cube 3D printers. <br>  <b>Why in the list: they</b> are engaged in the hardest task of promoting the 3D category to the Russian market.  Cube - the first printers with the potential to become home appliances. <br>  We interviewed the representative of the SIU System and soon will post it on Habr√©. <br>  <b>What Madrobots has in response:</b> In the summer of 2014, we will begin shipping the Buccaneer 3D printer, which collected about $ 1.5 million on <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pirate3d/the-buccaneer-the-3d-printer-that-everyone-can-use">Kickstarter</a> . <br>  Buccaneer is a revolution in the 3D printing market.  The first serial 3D home printer that looks great in any interior and costs less than $ 1,000. <br>  You can submit a request for a printer on the Madrobots.ru website at a price of 29,990 rubles: <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/51/1516/">madrobots.ru/catalog/51/1516</a> (even if due to currency fluctuations, we will have to change the retail price of printers, leaving a request, you can calculate at a price of 29,990 rubles). <br><br><h5>  Can-touch.ru <br><br></h5>  <a href="http://can-touch.ru/">Can-touch.ru</a> is a platform for ordering printing of 3D models and a store of finished products. <br>  <b>Why on the list:</b> give everyone the opportunity to get acquainted with 3D printing for little money. <br>  We interviewed the representative of Can-touch.ru. <br><br><h5>  vot-tak.com <br></h5>  Like this!  - shops of interesting gifts in Moscow. <br>  <b>Why on the list:</b> They collaborate with authors, artists who create interesting accessories and gifts.  For example, I bought from them a photo album ‚ÄúTime Machine‚Äù (2 990 rubles). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/95b/111/2c3/95b1112c3aff8bb1309fb9c470445887.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  LIFX <br></h5>  IDome Company is engaged in the production of dome houses and sells gadgets in the store Coolkeen. <br>  They are a distributor of LIFX lamps in Russia (a project with Kickstarter that raised more than $ 3 million). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/24c/a46/47c/24ca4647c19081fa058694869ad1288f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Why in the list:</b> Engaged <b>in the</b> most interesting direction in construction and develop the market of gadgets in Russia. <br>  Interview with the representative of iDome also we will lay out on Habr√©. <br>  <b>What Madrobots has in response:</b> We brought Marlight Wi-Fi lamps to Russia, which cost 2.5 times less than LIFX and Hue. <br>  To control the lamp via WiFi, you need to purchase a control controller.  In the App Store and Google Play there is an application Marlight. <br>  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/id687198712%3Fmt%3D8">Link to the App Store</a> . <br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.fafu.marlight_android1">Link to google play</a> . <br>  You can buy them on the site Madrobots: <a href="http://madrobots.ru/search/%3Fq%3Dmarlight">madrobots.ru/search/?q=marlight</a> <br>  We give all users of Habr a discount of 500 rubles per lamp (the price of one lamp will be only 990 rubles): the MARLIGHT code, valid until February 1. <br><br><h5>  3D pens <br></h5>  At the exhibition there were several stands of Chinese 3D pens, which are sold at prices ranging from 4,240 to 7,000 rubles. <br>  <b>What Madrobots has in response:</b> In the spring of 2014, we will start shipping 3D pens 3Doodler, which collected more than $ 2 million on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1351910088/3doodler-the-worlds-first-3d-printing-pen">Kickstarter</a> . <br>  You can leave a request for a pen on the Madrobots.ru website at a price of 3,990 rubles (yes, this is only $ 115 and cheaper than any Chinese solution): <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/51/1515/">madrobots.ru/catalog/51/1515</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d6c/892/881/d6c892881b14fe8bd4b4c82bc9ae10ab.jpg" alt="image"><br>  3Doodler is a product that can bring 3D printing to the masses and make it truly popular.  We are proud to represent the interests of the company WobbleWorks (manufacturer 3Doodler) in Russia and the fact that the retail price of pens in Madrobots is not much different from the US (and taking into account the cost of delivery, it does not differ at all). <br>  In April 2014, we will bring Daniel Cone, the creator of 3Doodler, to Moscow at the <a href="http://2014.russianinternetforum.ru/">RIF + KIB</a> 2014 conference where he will launch the official sales of 3Doodler in Russia. <br><br> <a href="https://twitter.com/MadrobotsRu"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac1/fc6/d2a/ac1fc6d2a19948c59791b0da6ab659df.gif"></a> <a href="http://vk.com/madrobots"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/933/ac3/0b6/933ac30b6fd24ffd82218148c2fb0917.gif"></a> <a href="http://instagram.com/madrobotsru"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/464/a82/e04/464a82e045a34bae81406fd0b640cf08.gif"></a> <a href="http://facebook.com/madrobotsrussia"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b5/542/136/0b55421365064901acdf0ed58cc4a111.gif"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63d/405/78e/63d40578ecbf48f28c62f57705c73eb6.gif"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/210370/">https://habr.com/ru/post/210370/</a></p>
