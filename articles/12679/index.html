Gates" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  Both are named after fathers.  Moreover, both - V.V.  One is Vladimir Vladimirovich, the other is William Williamovich. <br>  Mothers of both V.V.  name is mariyam. <br>  Both slightly over fifty.  Vladimir Vladimirovich - 54, William Williamovich - 51. <br>  Both were born in October.  But our V.V.  - Libra, and their V.V.  - Scorpio. <br>  Both V.V.  two daughters. <br>  In 2004, Time magazine included both V.V.  in the list of the most influential people of the world, and both won in the same nomination - ‚Äú <a href="http://www.time.com/time/2004/time100/leaders/">Leaders and revolutionaries</a> ‚Äù. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Both V.V.  are the heads of the world's largest corporations. <br>  Vladimir Vladimirovich has been the head of the Russia Corporation for 8 years now (142 million employees, gross domestic product in 2006 ‚Äî 937 billion dollars). <br>  For nearly 32 years, William Williamovich has been steadily driving Microsoft Corporation (71,000 employees, hundreds of millions of Windows computers around the world, sales in 2006 were $ 44 billion). <br>  Both V.V.  must hand over power in their corporations in 2008. <br>  Vladimir Vladimirovich‚Äôs term in office expires in May 2008.  The Russian Constitution does not allow the extension of our V.V. <br>  On June 15, 2006, William Williamovich announced his intention to withdraw from everyday participation in the affairs of Microsoft Corporation in July 2008 and fully concentrate on the implementation of the Bill and Melinda Gates charitable foundation projects in the field of education and health care. <br>  Both V.V.  have prepared their own successors. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/fd6/005/15c/fd600515c34feb58f38ed396e6e2c071.jpg" width="300" height="206" alt="Vladimir Vladimirovich with Sergey Ivanov and Dmitry Medvedev" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  In this photo, Vladimir Vladimirovich and his alleged successors are Deputy Prime Ministers Sergey Ivanov and Dmitry Medvedev.  Sergei Ivanov oversees the government of Russia in industry, transport, space, innovation in science, the military-industrial complex.  Dmitry Medvedev is responsible for the implementation of national projects, in particular ‚ÄúHealth‚Äù, ‚ÄúEducation‚Äù, ‚ÄúAffordable and Comfortable Housing for the Citizens of Russia‚Äù and ‚ÄúDevelopment of the AIC‚Äù. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/f83/f3b/221/f83f3b2214ce2dd7d056615b31a34548.jpg" width="450" height="210" alt="William Williamovich with Craig Mundy and Ray Ozzie" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  In this picture, William Williamovich with his successors, computer technology veterans Craig Mundie (left), in charge of research and strategy, and Ray Ozzie, chief software architect. <br>  Lord Mandy and Ozzy will share the responsibilities of William William.  Mandi will work with the federal government and the corporation‚Äôs international policy and will be a more public figure.  Ozzy focus on internal company management. <br>  In addition, Mandi will be influenced by long-term strategic decisions, while Ozzy will monitor current product development issues. <br>  Finally, Mandi will be responsible for system software, such as the Windows operating system, and Ozzy will answer the challenges set by Microsoft in the modern Internet environment. <br>  Both V.V.  insist on the finality of their decision. <br>  Vladimir Vladimirovich: ‚ÄúI will not change the Basic Law.  According to the Constitution can not be elected three times in a row.  To be elected for the third time, if not in a row, the Constitution does not prohibit.  True, not sure what I want. " <br>  William Williamovich: ‚ÄúI am in a happy situation when I can devote myself to interesting, exciting and important things and work on it together with wonderful and very influential people.  This work is so much that even a 24-hour working day is not enough. ‚Äù <br>  Political statements and business are equally suspicious of these statements. <br>  Political analyst Olga Kryshtanovskaya about Vladimir Vladimirovich: ‚ÄúI think Putin will run for president in 2012.  And for the period from 2008 to 2012 he will become prime minister.  Although not excluded other options - for example, he can head the parliament.  But this is unlikely ... if Putin remains in power, he will become the number one man in any chair.  And the new president will not be his successor, but an assistant ... ‚Äù. <br>  David Ioffe, professor at the Garvada School of Economics, about William Williamovich: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very difficult for a man of his age to build such a successful company, which today faces so many new challenges, to actually leave.  He can never become a nominal leader. ‚Äù <br>  Less than a year later we will learn how each of the two VVs.  decide for himself the notorious question: where to put a comma in the phrase "leave can not stay." </div>
