      Kaspersky Lab North America (NAM) includes two regional offices and is immediately responsible for two countries: the United States and Canada. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/35f/630/434/35f630434b7dad29e676727f71456a4b.jpg" align="left" alt="image">  The North American office speaks many languages.  Since the region includes both North and South America, many Spanish and Portuguese speakers work in the office.  There are several French-speaking employees who help our Canadian consumers from Quebec, and here you can also hear Russian, Polish and Ukrainian.  In the North American team is always gaining new people from different regions, so here you can find the present inflorescence of different cultures. <br><br>  Recently, the Boston office has grown in size due to a significant increase in staff (after all, the number of employees has grown 5 times since the opening!).  At the moment, Kaspersky Lab employees have a cafeteria, a gym (fully equipped with modern equipment and even a yoga room), there are several restaurants nearby and a hotel just across the street.  In September 2010, another regional office was opened in Seattle, WA.  This office is small, it houses our team in the field of antivirus development. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/LRFlaPhqb4w%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgmeynleYE9vpoh22FYaszip6yjEQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Excursion to the office from the Kaspersky video blog</i> <br><br>  The Woburn office offers employees a lot of nice bonuses, such as free coffee, tea, soda and juice, and even fresh bagels on Fridays!  From time to time, free lunches are arranged, culinary competitions with prizes are held among colleagues, and during the launch of new products everyone is poured champagne.  But here they not only know how to have good fun, they also work very hard and hard. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/104/62c/d36/10462cd360adfa2f52fc33c5c636e61c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  A few days before Christmas, all departments are participating in the traditional American event - Yankee Swap (swap means ‚Äúgift exchange‚Äù).  All bring their gifts to work, and then during the game exchange presents with each other. <br><br>  Office staff are given the opportunity to participate in social life.  Just recently, an event took place, during which volunteers at their lunchtime made postcards of congratulations on Valentine's Day for elderly citizens.  The party dedicated to this event was undoubtedly a success: there was a lot of music, pizza, and everyone was very pleased! <br><br>  <b>DACH (Germany, Austria, Switzerland)</b> <br>  <i>Office opening - 2003</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Location - Ingolstadt</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/37a/272/e3b/37a272e3bbf4e980e10d2b8f9db47ee1.jpg" align="left" alt="image">  The regional office of Kaspersky in the DACH region is located in the center of the German state of Bavaria, the city of Ingolstadt.  This is a very picturesque and lively city, which is undoubtedly worth a visit in itself.  Ingolstadt also has headquarters for such famous German companies as Audi, Cassidian Air Systems, MediaMarkt and Saturn.  The city, whose population is just over 124 thousand people, is part of Greater Munich, which in total has more than 5 million people. <br><br>  One of the most famous images of the ‚Äúmad scientist‚Äù in the world literature, Dr. Frankenstein, ‚Äúwas born‚Äù in Ingolstadt.  It was here in 1818 that Mary Shelley published the famous novel Frankenstein, or Modern Prometheus. <br><br>  The average age of the Kaspersky team in the DACH region is 34 years.  The office has the first employee who retired (this is probably one of the first retirees in such a ‚Äúyoung‚Äù business as the IT industry!) <br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/e_kaspersky/6806548193/" title="Kl Germany by Eugene Kaspersky, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d10/a16/77c/d10a1677c96c8ef78f892ac05b276632.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Kl Germany"></a> <br>  Each of the office staff receives a daily food voucher, with which you can pay for a business lunch at a nearby restaurant.  A typical lunch is ‚Ç¨ 3.10. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a4b/efa/aa7/a4befaaa757acb5e89421ee5dda17ffe.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Where more to spend on food with the arrival of the annual Oktoberfest!  One of the most popular events in the life of the office is the annual press tour during the festival.  The first such press tour took place in 2004. Since then, the Kaspersky European PR team every year invites journalists from all over the world to come to the Oktoberfest in Munich.  Last year, 35 journalists from all over Europe visited the press tour, 5 presentations were held with 6 speakers, 26 interviews were held, and in addition, 50 ginger muffins, 45 servings of game were eaten, and 165 liters of wonderful Bavarian beer was drunk. <br><br>  <b>France</b> <br>  <i>Office opening - 2004</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Location - Paris</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/507/bac/287/507bac287597daa975fae3fa1a63491c.jpg" align="left" alt="image">  Initially, the staff was only 4 people.  Currently, 67 employees work at Kaspersky Lab in France.  The French team is thinking about further expansion: it is quite possible that in 2012 the number of staff will increase to 70 people. <br><br>  The company's office is located quite far from the historic center of Paris.  The trip from Charles de Gaulle Airport to the office takes only 40 minutes. <br><br>  The French office is part of the ‚ÄúDeveloped Markets‚Äù segment, which also includes most of the countries of Western Europe and North America. <br><br>  The team of Kaspersky Lab France is very diverse.  Employees represent all areas of LK business, including sales and marketing, GReAT and R &amp; D, finance and administration, user support and, of course, the IT division. <br><br>  The office space is now optimized: it should soon become an even more pleasant place to work and meet guests. <br><br>  <b>Canada</b> <br>  <i>Office opening - 2010</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Location - Markham Ontario</i> <br><br>  The Canadian headquarters of Kaspersky Lab is located in the small town of Markham Ontario, which is in fact the satellite city of Canada‚Äôs largest metropolis Toronto. <br><br>  Currently, the Canadian B &amp; B team consists of eight people, some of whom are engaged in sales, some - technical staff.  The team develops relations with consumers from the sphere of small and medium-sized businesses, as well as large corporations.  An important part of the work is to establish contacts with distributors. <br><br>  Canada is the second largest country in the world; it occupies 6 time zones at once.  Therefore, our Canadian colleagues cannot do without work in the regions: representatives of the LC sales team work in Vancouver, Toronto and Quebec - the three largest megalopolises of the country. <br><br>  At the moment, Kaspersky products are ranked second in retail sales in Canada - a truly impressive achievement, which was achieved in less than 3 years of work! <br><br>  The Canadian team conducts more than 5,300 business transactions in corporate sales per year.  500 of our clients from the small and medium business sector account for 65% of all sales, 35% are in the sphere of large corporations and enterprises. <br><br>  As is known, Canada has two official languages ‚Äã‚Äã- English and French.  The first francophone sales representative was hired by the company in February 2010, and this helped significantly increase our business in the French-speaking province of Quebec. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/609/03e/098/60903e0985275cd31948a22205f39cb9.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And finally: Canadians are passionate hockey fans, and the national hockey team always takes first place in all world championships.  There is nothing surprising in the fact that the favorite sport of all employees of the Canadian office of LK is hockey! <br><br>  <b>Baltic</b> <br>  <i>Office opening - October 13, 2010</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Location - Riga</i> <br><br>  The Kaspersky Lab regional office in the Baltic countries, which includes Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, was officially opened in the Latvian capital Riga a little over a year ago - on October 13, 2010.  The Baltic office is the 27th regional office opened in the world. <br><br>  Andis Steinmanis, Managing Director of the Baltic Office, a ‚Äúuniversal soldier,‚Äù as he calls himself, was hired by Kaspersky Lab on July 15, 2010.  Andis represents the company in the region and combines marketing and partner relations functions with management. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/74d/3c5/7ca/74d3c57ca53f9e13bafa4cbf294eb693.jpg" align="right" alt="image"><br><br>  The company's Riga office is located on the left bank of the Daugava River, which divides the Latvian capital into two parts.  The left bank is a rapidly developing part of the city.  Among the advantages of the area are less dense car traffic, free parking, proximity to the airport and the city center.  The office building in which the Baltic representative office of the LC is located has just recently been erected by a German construction company and ‚Äúimpregnated‚Äù with the German desire for cleanliness and order.  For this reason, the Baltic office is intensely concerned with the recycling and sorting of garbage. <br><br>  The decision to open an office in Riga was made not by chance.  The Latvian capital is located right in the middle of the Baltic region: from here it is 300 km in a straight line both to Vilnius and Tallinn.  Such a geographical location helps to save time when traveling around the region. <br><br>  <b>Iberia</b> <br>  <i>Office opening - June 2008</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Location - Pozuelo de Alarcon (a suburb of Madrid) / Lisbon / Bilbao</i> <br><br>  Kaspersky Lab Iberia (KLI) - the regional office of Kaspersky Lab, which develops the company's business in two countries at once - Spain and Portugal - was organized not so long ago, in June 2008. <br><br>  At the time of creation, the company had 8 employees, today their number has increased to 35 people, of which 6 people are the management team.  Interesting fact: all six were born in 1974!  Another notable feature of the KLI office is the youth of its employees.  The average age of staff is 33 years old, the youngest is 23 years old, and the oldest is 44. <br><br>  The Spanish office of the company is based in the large office building of the business complex La Ciudad de la Imagen (‚ÄúLa Ciudad de la Imagen -‚Äú Cities of Images ‚Äù), which also houses producers of audiovisual and information products, for example, the archive of the Spanish State Film Library, the central offices of the Telemadrid TV channels and La Sexta, a number of filmmakers. <br><br>  La Ciudad de la Imagen is located in the historic suburb of Pozuelo de Alarc√≥n, located in the south-west of Madrid.  Its name indicates that in the Middle Ages there were many wells and springs in this village (pozo in Spanish means ‚Äúwell‚Äù).  Alarcon is the name of a wealthy family who, in ancient times, established its protectorate over this suburb.  Employees who live in the central areas of Madrid usually reach the office in the morning, 30‚Äì45 minutes.  Remoteness from the city allows you to avoid traffic jams (and they are common in the Spanish capital), and also gives a chance to enjoy the fresh air away from the city smog. <br><br>  In addition to the Madrid office, Kaspersky Lab Iberia also has two smaller regional offices - one in Lisbon (Portugal) and the other in Bilbao (autonomous region of the Basque Country).  There are three employees in the Portuguese office, and only one in Basque.  The Portuguese office of KLI was opened in February of this year, Eugene Kaspersky came to the opening ceremony. <br><br>  The Iberian office is international: in addition to the Spaniards and the Portuguese, there works a Russian employee, Irina Platitsina, in the state, there is also a person from Mozambique.  The language of communication is Spanish, besides, everyone speaks good English. <br><br>  Last summer, the office was expanded due to an increase in staff.  Moreover, the expansion was done in the most efficient and fast way.  ‚ÄúWe simply demolished the wall that separated the office from the new vacant premises, and organized new jobs in one month!‚Äù Says Sergio Ruiz, financial and administrative director of KLI. <br><br>  Perhaps the busiest place in the office is the corporate kitchen.  In a small room there is a coffee machine (Spaniards cannot live without coffee!), Shelves for food, a sofa and a darts target. <br><br>  One of the main corporate events held in the office shortly before Christmas.  ‚ÄúFilm Day with Kaspersky‚Äù is already a tradition for the Iberian ‚ÄúFamilia Kaspersky‚Äù.  All team members get together with business partners, customers, friends and relatives and enjoy watching movies, of course, with the same popcorn and drinks. <br><br>  <b>Poland</b> <br>  <i>Office opening - 2001</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Location - Czestochowa</i> <br><br>  Kaspersky Lab products appeared on the Polish market in 1995 (then they were called Antiviral Toolkit Pro, or AVP).  Since 2001, the company has been operating in the Polish market under the name Kaspersky Lab Poland. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/db3/22e/04e/db322e04ea9ea0855ee50029ce599448.jpg" align="left" alt="image">  The main office of the company is located in a separate building in the city of Czestochowa, in the south of Poland, in the Silesian province.  This is one of the oldest and most beautiful Polish cities, whose main attraction is the Jasna Gora monastery, which houses the image of the Black Madonna, which is sacred to all Catholics.  Every year, millions of pilgrims from all over the world come to Czestochowa to see the ‚ÄúMost Blessed Mary‚Äù (Holy Mary - Polish). <br><br>  Polish Kaspersky employees are talented not only in the field of information security.  Among them - musicians, artists, many are fond of extreme sports. <br><br>  The work of the Polish press service is highly regarded by local journalists.  The department‚Äôs work was twice praised at the European level: in 2009, the PR department received a corporate award in the Best Country PR Performance category, and in 2010, Poles' achievements in the field of public relations were recognized as outstanding (the Corporate Prize Extraordinary PR Achievement in Europe).  For many years of work and direct activity of the Polish Kaspersky Lab has been awarded numerous awards. <br><br>  In the very near future, the company will open its office in the capital, Warsaw. <br><br>  <b>Great Britain</b> <br>  <i>Office opening - July 1999</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Location - Ebingdon, Oxfordshire</i> <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/mDccBuL19ZM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgzncDvlLRzagSvL6554SVzXXhBuQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Currently, 99 people work in the office of Kaspersky Lab in the UK, including full-time employees and those working for a contract company.  Now the whole British office, with bated breath, is waiting for who will be the 100th employee of Kaspersky Lab in Britain. <br><br>  The company's office is located in the Milton Park technology park, which is located in Ebingdon, Oxfordshire.  The location of our British office is very convenient: it is equally easy to reach from anywhere in the UK, including from all the major cities in the country.  50 miles separate Abingdon from London, 35 miles (50 minutes by car) from London Heathrow Airport. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/832/54d/549/83254d549e9f16fe121502c9a604b598.jpg" alt="image">  The British office in the structure of Kaspersky Lab is part of the ‚ÄúDeveloped Markets‚Äù (Mature Markets).  In the UK team there are employees representing all major areas of work in the LC, including R &amp; D (research and development), sales and marketing, GReAT, finance, HR, technical support and IT. <br><br>  For fruitful work and maintaining the exchange of information about the projects of colleagues, every Monday in the office ‚ÄúCoffee morning‚Äù is held.  This tradition has already been done for several years: a table with coffee, cakes and fruit is laid in the reception room, which are eagerly consumed by employees who have the opportunity to discuss the latest work news.  True, these meetings do not always last long: first, everyone is forever busy and constantly in a hurry somewhere, and secondly, the cakes disappear from the table too quickly! <br><br>  Monthly at the office is determined by the "Employee of the month."  He is selected by secret ballot of all office workers. <br><br>  The team of the British office annually takes part in the Willow Cup, which is played between football teams representing all leading European IT companies.  Last year, our British won the coveted Cup, and at the end of this year they are going to defend their champion title.  As the British colleagues are joking, ‚Äúprobably, we ourselves were most surprised at our victory!‚Äù We wish them good luck! <br><br>  <b>Japan</b> <br>  <i>Office opening - 2004</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Location - Tokyo</i> <br><br>  The Japanese office of Kaspersky Lab was opened in Tokyo in 2004.  The representative office of the company was originally a joint venture with a local firm iMEX Co.  Ltd.  - a system developer specializing in integrated information security solutions.  Currently, the Japanese office is a subsidiary of Kaspersky Lab. <br><br>  Of the 50 people on staff today, 7 corporate sales managers, 7 consumer sales managers, 13 marketing people, 9 in technical support, 9 more in localized QA, 2 employees in the laboratory work in the Japanese team of Kaspersky Lab, 3 people are responsible for finance and administration, plus 1 auditor. <br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/e_kaspersky/6117069602/" title="Tokyo - KL JP Office by Eugene Kaspersky, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/512/4f7/d64/5124f7d64be9ea95dc4710b599be6f5a.jpg" width="500" height="288" alt="Tokyo - KL JP Office" align="right"></a>  Most of the employees, which is quite natural, are Japanese.  There are no expats in the office in the full sense of the word, but there are two employees of foreign origin hired for local positions.  Michael Molzner, originally from Germany, is a regional developer, a member of GReAT, who heads the IT security laboratory in Japan.  Maria Kandaurova, as you can already guess, is Russian, has been working at the company as a QA engineer for over two years. <br><br>  Kaspersky Lab, being still a foreign company, provides more free conditions for its employees than it is in Japanese organizations.  Thus, an employee of the company has the right to take a week-long vacation not only for not only summer, which is the generally accepted norm for Japan, but also has a winter vacation.  This is an unusual phenomenon for local companies, where the remaining number of days is taken only for short-term time off. <br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/e_kaspersky/6117069624/" title="Tokyo - KL JP Office by Eugene Kaspersky, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e97/aa1/b1c/e97aa1b1cd81ba6995cc1abd98ec147f.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="Tokyo - KL JP Office" align="left"></a>  In connection with the expansion of states, the Japanese office of Kaspersky Lab in June 2011 moved to a new office space.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãdeployment, however, remained the same - this is the legendary Akihabara, which in Tokyo is called the Electric City.  The new office is 9 times larger in area than the previous one: 1069.36 m2 instead of the previous 115.36 m2!  Now it is just five minutes walk from the Japanese subway station Akihabara (JR).  The 19-floor office building of Sumitomo Realty &amp; Development Akihabara Building was built in 2009. <br><br>  The name of the Tokyo district of Akihabara, which houses the office of Kaspersky Lab, translated from Japanese sounds like: ‚ÄúField of autumn leaves‚Äù (ÁßãËëâÂéü).  Akihabara is also known by its second name - Electric City (Akihabara Denki Gai).  This is where the largest stores in Tokyo and a number of shops with all kinds of electronics, appliances and computers are located.  Electric City also has the status of a tax-free zone, which makes local shopping more attractive to foreigners (by the way, the VAT in Japan is only 5%).  So the location of our Japanese office is quite logical.  The Japanese often abbreviate the name of the area to "Akiba."  But in fact, what Tokians call Akihabara is indicated in official documents as the Soto-Kanda, Kanda-Matsunaga and Kanda-Neribei districts, part of the Chiyoda-kyu district.  This Akihabara is located in the Taito-kyu neighborhood next door and is no different. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140099/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140099/</a></p>
