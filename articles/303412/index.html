How systems with circumcised functionality try to take over the world</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a5a/5bd/fa3/a5a5bdfa39054a83acaf000d626387df.jpg"><br><br>  One American marketer bought a Ferrari sports car. <br>  For some time he enjoyed the envious glances of passersby and the attention of girls, and then he realized that it was very inconvenient to drive a car. <br><br>  The low seating position and bucket seats were well adapted for high speeds, but ... But it was impossible to accelerate to these speeds.  The traffic police very strictly and effectively monitored the observance of the speed limit. <br>  Several penalties finally won the marketer, that the only use of a powerful engine is the ability to quickly accelerate to the allowed 50 miles per hour.  But given that he spent 80 percent of the time on the road in traffic, and this opportunity remained largely unclaimed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c75/413/536/c754135365c7415389008c7b52778f58.jpg">

      At the same time, the trunk was small, and the child would not fit in the rear seats either.  Low ground clearance required special care when parking.  Expensive and frequent maintenance took out of the pocket a lot of money.  Well, the car itself cost quite a lot. <br><br>  And once the marketer thought.  After all, there are only two places in the world where you can drive without speed limit - the famous German autobahns and some desert areas of Australia.  Fans of driving specifically go there, take powerful cars for rent and enjoy for several days. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/de8/240/2ec/de82402ec38b4893b268e9372d8acc67.jpg"><br><br>  Marketer felt like a camel from a joke.  You probably know him, but just in case I will retell it. <br><br>  <i>The mother of the camel asks the mother: - Mom, why do we need humps?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- In them we store water to live in the desert.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Why do we have such big legs?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- In order not to fall into the sand when you walk in the desert.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Why are the lips so thick?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- To have a thorn, which only grows in the desert.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The kid thought and said: - Well, why do we need all these frills at the zoo?</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/afa/02f/8a0/afa02f8a0bfc48559803dca4e7656b70.jpg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúSo why do I need all these bells and whistles in a busy Los Angeles traffic jam,‚Äù thought the marketer.  But since he was a professional, he soon understood.  It is because of the admiration of the surrounding and flirty looks of girls. <br>  Fat, elderly, clumsy, stocky, ugly - yes anyone.  In the sports car you will become a macho! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5cb/dd5/a72/5cbdd5a729184fb885cb8470a5f005f7.jpg"><br><br>  And then the marketer dawned.  <b>People associate sports cars with success and attractiveness.</b>  <b>However, due to road restrictions, no one can assess the quality of the motor.</b> <br><br>  So why produce real sports cars with a powerful engine, if you can do an imitation.  The appearance of these "fakes" will be quite a sporty, and everything else ... well, a little better than the usual sedans. <br><br>  And away we go.  Someone just did not engage in the manufacture of such pseudo sports cars. <br><br>  Toyota Celica <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d9d/f68/f23/d9df68f23e2c4122b4d7b3ec09e06be8.jpg"><br><br>  Mitsubishi Eclipse.  Made on the basis of the usual Lancer (and not at all Evolution).  I myself tried to drive it in the hilly Seattle - this car was barely moving uphill. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e3d/866/aae/e3d866aae91e41348ec26be8d1d2d00d.jpg"><br><br>  Well, for the company, Hyundai Tiburon (we sold as Coupe).  Made on the chassis of the usual Elantra with minimal changes to the engine and brakes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/552/d65/18a/552d6518a3ca4bef842644dacf76a1e1.jpeg"><br><br>  In the cabin of these "mummers sport cars" the same tightness, the clearance is the same low.  But the prices are several times less.  So people are buying these "Ferrari for the poor." <br><br>  And our marketer brought this rule: <br><blockquote>  As it is known, the Consumer (including the corporate one) buys not the real consumer qualities and functionality of the product, but the benefits (including emotional) that the product can bring to him. <br>  So, there is no need to strain and polish the quality and increase the functionality of the product. <br>  Moreover, an excessive number of functions is harmful, because it increases the cost of goods and interferes with the choice of the consumer. </blockquote>  From the point of view of cars, this means that it is not necessary to invest in the development of more powerful engines, efficient suspension and brakes.  The buyer assesses <b>only the</b> similarity with the classic sports cars, so it is enough to make a spectacular body. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the same thing happens not only in the car market, but also in the software market.  I'll tell you about our niche, because I know it thoroughly. <br><br>  There are quite a few systems that record the working time.  Systems were able to determine what employees were doing on their work PCs.  Formerly, their developers tried to make them as user-friendly as possible and add more necessary functionality. <br><br>  And then some developers said, ‚ÄúOur clients are not interested in functionality, they want to see simple reports.‚Äù  As a result, their systems began to collect only information about visited sites and running programs.  These data were summarized in a simple report. <br>  The problem was that the information in such reports was very incomplete, and the system could be easily deceived. <br><br>  Other developers have decided that it‚Äôs very important for their customers to get as much information as possible.  Which letters were received, sent, which messages were exchanged, which files were opened ‚Äî and much more.  And all this data volume is poured out on the user.  And in the form of primitive html files. <br>  It is clear that no one can overcome the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãdata, but this ‚Äúcomplete control‚Äù creates a good illusion of protection. <br><br>  As a result, the market is stagnating.  Some sell beautiful reports - <b>simplicity</b> , others a lot of data - <b>volume</b> , and as a result, no qualitatively new and at the same time working solutions come to the market.  Moreover, unlike the example with cars, the cost of products is about the same, that is, customers deliberately pay for the "Lada" the price of a Ferrari.  And what, also a red car with a horse ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a7a/202/a40/a7a202a40e944be3b7402eb0ccc524e5.jpg"><br><br>  What to do in such a situation - each company decides for itself.  You can get close to one of the groups, and you can introduce new methods and principles of work. <br><br>  In general, do not be like everyone else, look for your way. <br>  And good luck to your business! <br><br>  PS Yes, I know that in the very first picture is not Ferrari, but Porsche.  Just really liked the picture :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/303412/">https://habr.com/ru/post/303412/</a></p>
