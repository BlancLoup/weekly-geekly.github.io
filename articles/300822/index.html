Tony Stark directed the weapon at his former friend in full readiness to shoot.  The hall froze.  Captured spectators stopped chewing chips and stared at their hero. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  We like the antisocial selfish heroes.  Sherlock Holmes, James Bond, Iron Man, Jack Sparrow.  All of them have common features in which we fall in love.  We like their charisma and independence, but, despite the desire to be like them, we behave the opposite: imitate, follow and quote.  These qualities are not peculiar to the heroes of books and films, but for some reason peculiar to us.

      Heroes motivate.  The charismatic Harvey Spectrum from the series ‚ÄúForce Majeure‚Äù shows that success is achieved by work.  And indeed, after watching the show I want to work.  But with many examples of success in film and life, we begin to forget that each of us has our own way. <br><br>  The hero of the book, Sergei Minaev, leaving the office said: "Why, like, intelligent people with a good education want to seem dumber?".  Why indeed?  Why do young people forget about the future, disappearing in the present?  Why do people, having earned money for an apartment and a car, find themselves in a crisis? <br><br>  Most have no goals.  We have guidelines based on the understanding of a happy (correct) life.  And everything would be fine if these guidelines were not imposed on us. <br><br>  Successful people are individual.  They do not need examples like ‚Äúdo as I do‚Äù.  They create this principle and unconsciously distract followers from the road they need. <br><br>  It is important to understand that success, happiness can be achieved in any way.  It doesn't matter what you did yesterday.  Life every day provides opportunities to become better, and if you make a step towards good luck, you will succeed. <br><br>  Your merits are individual.  There is probably no one else, even people looking at us from Olympus.  To be high yourself, you do not need to change yourself much.  You are ready to become better and achieve decent results.  You just have to choose the right target.  And this can be done only in one way. <br><br>  The world is full of opinions and dogmas.  If you give up these things, you can look inside yourself and understand what matters to you.  In this case, intuition is more important than reason.  But as soon as you find your vocation, it is the mind that will help you build a path to the goal.  You will come across misunderstanding, criticism, but you will become an individual that you may not recognize aloud, but will always appreciate inside you. <br><br>  Taking risks does not mean doing something extraordinary.  It seems to me that the risk is to remain the same as everyone else without trying to fulfill their wildest dreams.  And what should we lose?  Become mediocre, we always have time. <br><br>  <i>This article appeared from my observations primarily for myself.</i>  <i>In addition to her, I wrote a poem:</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>You know what I'm talking about.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And these thoughts disturb us so often.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>When we believe not our heart,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And how much it costs.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>When in the morning we feel the dawn.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And it seems again that everything is possible.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Routine affairs, and dinner came.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Again everything around was somehow difficult.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Although it seemed we found the answer.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And he lay inside that I believed.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>But after again, I hear someone's nonsense.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>He says that I dreamed in a fog.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>And if I try again to move away</i> <i><br></i>  <i>From his words and from annoying judgments,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I have to go alone again</i> <i><br></i>  <i>After all, the world of people does not tolerate personal opinions.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>But I will risk, because to live among the shackles</i> <i><br></i>  <i>It makes no sense, and maybe even stupid.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And I will remember, having reached the clouds,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>It was difficult, throwing up his hands in the sky.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300822/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300822/</a></p>
