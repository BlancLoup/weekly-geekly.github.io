Sorry for this stupid introduction - I think it‚Äôs not for me alone that sometimes. <br><br>  The article is really good.  Unlike other articles about startups, from which, as the author rightly notes, many are already sick.  And everything seems to be in the case and quite logical.  Here is just one moment in the position of the author seemed to me controversial: "Do what you like, it does not work - throw, it's not yours."  I cannot agree with this.  No matter what your hobby or specialty is, whatever you come up with - when you reach a certain level (business / start-up / salary / freelance), sooner or later you will have to deal with something that is not to be talked about, but with which or later anyone is facing.  Everything cool and funny, what you were fascinated with, and what inspired you, will become just your work (or business, in this context it doesn't matter).  Only then comes the real test of strength. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  There is no point in trying to force yourself to fall in love again with your project.  No trainings, no additional motivators like the podcasts from Spiridonov, no other, even if superpositive, husks will inspire you as before.  It is like a married life.  Love over the years does not pass (if it is real, of course), but it will change.  You can associate this with the maturing of a person or with some hormones, but to love just as before, no longer works.  You have to love differently - to deny yourself something, to make concessions, to endure, to take care, to feel responsibility and all that jazz about what they say in stupid films.  Films, of course, stupid, but otherwise - does not work.  Otherwise, swearing, scandals and divorce, and God knows what kind of trouble.

      Like love, inspiration sooner or later begins to deflate, like a balloon.  And that's fine.  Everybody goes through it.  And do not listen, when a 40-year-old millionaire in another career story tells that he loves his work, as before, and that he still has enough enthusiasm and inspiration to stay up at night and work 7 days a week for free.  It does not happen.  Sooner or later, but the fuse always ends.  This is where the most difficult thing begins - to be able to organize yourself and others, inspire again, and sometimes even make you work full, drive out or even throw someone, go through swearing, quarrels, arguments, resentment and still keep afloat and move on. <br><br>  Strange as it may sound for someone, but it seems to me that no successful business can do without it.  Only he, this most successful business, does not tell about it.  He tells how everything is beautiful, how inspired the team works, how money flows, how investors are cramming with their millions.  And what's on the back of the medal?  Throwed or disgruntled developers, a huge red minus in the balance, a lot of rash decisions, other people's money spent in the void, growing debts, constant risk, disagreements and sharing with partners, and also problems in the family, ruined health and all the same worn jeans for all occasions <br><br>  Steve Jobs is most likely just a unique person and an exception to the rule.  Most (and if not to be cautious, then all 99, (9)%) successfully or at least somehow working businesses went through all this, and moreover, they pass constantly, faced with even more serious difficulties and troubles.  And this is absolutely normal.  One very experienced and successful entrepreneur once said to me: the main thing that distinguishes an entrepreneur from others is strong will.  This statement may seem too banal or pretentious, but I think it is worth listening to at least. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136021/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136021/</a></p>
