  <section class="page js-page"><h1>CMS Pligg Review. Part 1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="http://www.pligg.com/">CMS Pligg Review</a> <br>  So, I just want to warn you that I‚Äôve been able to work with this CMS as a regular user, since I don‚Äôt know and do not like PHP) In principle, I like <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">django</a> much more as a framework for developing web applications, but in this case there was a task quickly expand the site. <br><br>  The site had to meet the following requirements: <br>  - Ability to add / comment / mark your favorite news <br>  - Ability to automatically read news from rss feeds <br>  - To be web 2.0 nym <br>  Pligg fits these requirements perfectly.  So, let's begin. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Installation</b> <br>  For Russia, install a better localized version of Pligg - <br>  <a href="http://www.pliggrse.com/download.html">PliggRSE</a> .  In addition to the localization of the interface, this version adds functionality transliterating CNC (a man like url).  Those.  instead of YourSite / News - VyshSayt / Novost will be written. <br>  In practice, I did not manage to connect this functionality, or rather I managed to, but at the same time some English-language plug-ins (modules) broke down, which apparently do not suspect the presence of such functionality in the Russian module.  I still had no time to deal with this, and I chose the lesser of two evils - by turning off the CNC.  At first, I was afraid that Russian localizers added bugs along with the functionality, so I installed the English version.  It turned out - no.  Bugs grow from source distribution).  The distribution kit by the way weighs less than a megabyte in the archive, which seemed to me a good sign against the background of the many megabytes of other CMS.  The installation itself took place in general without any problems, pleases with a pleasant interface and detailed <a href="http://pliggrse.com/tipsandtriks.html">instructions</a> .  The only time is when creating the database in the ansi encoding - some difficulties have arisen, but transferring the database to UTF-8 has removed the questions.  And when installing locally, to Denver, I cursed the absence of PHP functions mb_convert * in the link.php library, but commenting on their call earned it to Denver. <br>  <b>Functional</b> <br>  The functionality of the system is quite unusual.  On the one hand, the system is very much ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù specifically for web 2.0-style news sites, and on the other hand, it has quite limited capabilities in other areas.  Well, for example, here I did not find a menu editor, for example, or the simplest possibility to create static pages and post links to them.  On the other hand, very powerful tools, such as the system of posting news and voting for them, add friends, track comments and publications, internal messages, tag clouds, rss-feeds, etc.  - are basic built-in functions.  Those.  if you want to build something different from a news site with ‚Äúuser generated content‚Äù, you may want to look at something more <a href="http://joomla.org/">traditional</a> .  The basic functionality of Pligg can be significantly extended with modules. <br><br>  <b>Modules</b> <br>  There are not so many modules for Pligg as for other CMS, but on the other hand, they are much more interesting because of the web-two orientation of programmers who use it.  From the simplest modules that allow you to add static pages to your site to various integrations with digg-flicr and automatic ‚Äúburners‚Äù rss streams.  But using modules you need to be prepared for the fact that they can be "damp" or made for earlier versions of pligg.  In general, to be honest, using pligg you have to be ready for anything).  I was attracted by pligg, largely due to the presence of the rss feed publication module.  But here, too, a small <a href="http://forums.pligg.com/pligg-mods/7257-modify-data-rss-feed-before-inserting-2.html">file debugging has</a> not been done.  On the other hand, to me, a person familiar with PHP at the level of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to know how this function works,‚Äù I manage to use it.  Largely due to the rather transparent directory / file structure and the developers' frustration with excessive object-orientation.  Those.  As a rule, scripts do not consist of 10 lines of code and one hundred eighteen inclusions, and as a result, are readable.  The situation is more complicated with templates. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <b>Templates</b> <br>  This section claims to be the shortest) In order to recalculate the free working templates for plygg - enough fingers) <br><br>  <b>Admin panel</b> <br>  The administrative interface is a bit unusual for me, but over time you get used and it is quite possible to use it.  The truth is that constant ‚Äúconfirm the change of status of the news‚Äù annoys you when managing news, etc.  - but I think this should just be sawed slightly. <br><br>  <b>Bugs</b> <br>  There are glitches in pligg) This is mainly due to the fact that the CMS is very parameterized.  Those.  various appearance customization options, etc.  - disrespect.  Accordingly, you can easily run into mutually exclusive modules or funny moments. For example, when setting a certain type of CNC (1st mine), the padjina of news flies.  In general, this gives rise to distrust of the system, while looking for the cause and led for example to me - that I tried to add news for a couple of hours with a heading like ‚ÄúY‚Äù and content ‚Äútest‚Äù - I went through all the sources instead of looking at the minimum message length settings ) But glitches, everything seems to be surmountable.  Probably under certain circumstances (not experimenting with the settings for example) they can not even run into them) <br><br>  <b>Community</b> <br>  The community in Russia is quite small <a href="http://forum.pliggrse.com/">(Russian forum on Pligg RSE)</a> so I found most of the answers on the <a href="http://forums.pligg.com/">off-forum</a> .  True, most of the visitors are freeloaders-users like me) But the forum is big - you can find the answers. <br><br>  <b>Performance and Prospects</b> <br>  In terms of performance, I can‚Äôt say anything yet, because  attendance is still low, but it seems the developers promise an acceptable performance of up to 200 people on virtual hosting, which honestly sows vague doubts about what to do if the project grows.  All the same, for tens of thousands, as I understand it, it is not designed even on a dedicated server.  Although news2.ru seems to be on it, they probably finished it ... <br>  The prospects are still worse) <br><br>  The developers promise to finish the unit and rewrite everything in the bud.  Usually such promises don't end well.  I prefer the evolutionary path of development than the revolutionary.  Although, on the other hand, for the time being, I would like to master the functionality that is) Not until the updates ... <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br>  Total, despite some comments in the process of grinding to the system, I really liked it.  Some sufferings arose in the process, but the result - the <a href="http://www.recoilme.ru/">site is built</a> - and I like it!) <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/13672/">https://habr.com/ru/post/13672/</a></p>
