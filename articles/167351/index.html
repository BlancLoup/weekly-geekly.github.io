  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Business Plan "Creating a Game"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Some time ago I wrote a business plan, a design document and a concept document for creating a game. <br>  Unfortunately, the information is 2011, but I think it is useful to colleagues. <br>  The system of indicators of gameplay assessment was invented by me, so this business plan, my entire subjective vision. <br><br><h4>  1. Introduction </h4><br>  Since ancient times, one of the most vivid illustrations of the needs and desires of man is the ancient Roman concept of "bread and circuses."  Moreover, the "spectacle" can be interpreted in a broader sense - as generally "entertainment."  Whether we like it or not, after entertainment and sex, entertainment is perhaps the main thing that concerns the average consumer of any race and nationality.  Therefore, the entertainment industry has long been a diversified and well-functioning business.  On the Internet, one of its most prominent branches is games: casual, browser-based, games on social networks, and the like.  On the scale of the planet now it is already billions of dollars in annual turnover. <br><br><h4>  2. Market opportunities </h4><br>  For a start, you just need to do business in the Russian Internet - this is one of the fastest growing markets.  If we talk about specific business areas, there is great potential in e-commerce projects and services based on social connections.  And of course, games, games, games.  People start playing who were not interested in games before - for example, on a mobile phone.  Games are attracting more and more new users, and this will continue.  It just turned out that among the huge variety of content games are most popular.  The combination of communication and entertainment services (especially games) works very well. (1) <br>  The Russian Internet market is one of the few markets that have not ceased to grow in a crisis, according to all indicators: advertising, domains, hosting, audience size.  The web development segment is no exception. <br>  Today in 2011 the Internet is inhabited by 43 million Russians (39% of the population).  Of these, 35 million people are an active Runet audience, and 25 million visit the Russian network daily.  At the same time, 92% of users are registered in at least one social network, where 25 million people are monthly and 16 million daily.  The share of Internet users in the country on average is: 92% in the category of 12-24 years, 76% in the population of 25-44 years, 25% in the population of 45 years and more.

Alisa Chumachenko is the founder and president of Game Insight in an interview with Forbes Russia. <br></h5><br><br><h4>  3.2.  Our product <br></h4><br>  The essence of any Internet project is not just to create a good product, but also to show it.  Social networks allow you to do this without a marketing budget.  You create a product, you spread it online, without paying anything, and you tell your friends on the social network.  In the usual Internet this is not possible, only in social networks. <br>  But in social networks need virality (viral reaction).  Only this allows you to gain an audience without large investments.  But you can get it only under certain conditions. <br>  First of all, the difference lies in guarantees of a high probability of successful implementation of the idea.  Direct guarantees of success cannot exist in principle, but guarantees that all necessary conditions for increasing the probability of success exist and must be fulfilled. <br>  Many developers are starting to make "original" games, but they produce raw unprocessed products.  As a result, the user does not want to invite friends.  And without viral it does not work. <br>  The idea may not be the most original, it is enough to pay attention to the subject of films, serials and programs, which are loaded to the eyeballs of our television channels.  You just need to translate it into the language of the social game. (11) The only thing is that the game should not repeat another game in this social network. <br><br>  <b>Our advantages:</b> <br>  1. New game in social networks <br>  2. Compliance with all conditions to increase the likelihood of success (detailed description in the section of the business plan ‚ÄúImplementation‚Äù) <br><br><h6>  11. Andrey Pryakhin, Head of Kefir Company </h6><br><br><h4>  3.3.  Idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe game </h4><br><br>  Our first game will be created on the basis of the popular in its time game for the iPhone platform, socialized and supplemented.  This is a strong idea, based on a product for which people are willing to pay.  An idea that satisfies an existing need. <br>  The game meets the basic requirements: <br>  1. Novelty on the market - there is no such product in this market segment, the game is only on the platform for iPhone. <br>  2. Addictive gameplay (which we will create) <br><br>  Next comes the description of the game ... <br><br><h4>  4. Implementation </h4><br><br>  The second and <b>main task</b> is to implement.  There is a lot of literature on creating games, but the social games market is fairly new.  We have our own vision of the approach to project implementation - a systematic approach in relation to the creation of social games.  This business plan describes its main provisions. <br>  <b>The system approach</b> involves the consideration of an object as an integral set of elements in the totality of relations and relations between them, that is, the consideration of an object as a system, identifying patterns and relationships for the purpose of their more efficient use.  As a result, we expect to get a <b>systemic effect</b> ‚Äî a result of a special reorganization of the elements of the system, when the whole becomes larger than the simple sum of the parts. <br><br>  For the successful implementation of the project it is necessary to take into account all the criteria for the success of the product: <br>  1. The key role is played by <b>the gameplay system</b> (we will look at it in more detail below) <br>  2. In second place is the <b>quality of performance</b> .  Here, more meant graphics, music, internal balance and stability of the application.  You need to think ahead and start the game to take care of the user, preventing the server from falling. <br>  3. <b>Monetization</b> .  No matter what the game will be, the main thing is what to sell in it and at what price.  At this point you need to go especially carefully.  Monetization will be set up carefully, it is important to withstand the moment when the user is ready to pay and provide him with convenient means for making a payment (time <b>management of purchases</b> ). <br>  4. <b>Community</b> .  This means the organization of high-quality technical support, care about the user. <br><br>  Let us dwell on the <b>gameplay</b> .  We describe how the company plans to effectively develop the game.  More precisely, the principles of creation. <br><br>  To begin with, we will define our products: <br>  <b>The end product</b> is the user's emotional satisfaction. <br>  <b>The goal of the game</b> is to bring him great emotional rewards with minimal effort. <br>  Emotions go hand in hand with the development of conditioned reflexes: the repetition of the same emotion that appears in connection with a particular event or object, eventually turns into an emotional predisposition to this event.  The ‚Äúplayful‚Äù mood that we want to arouse in the player is a long-term consequence of the emotions experienced during the game.  The game should cause the player positive emotions. <br>  This is achieved, for example, by encouragement, when we constantly ‚Äúmonitor‚Äù the achievements of the player and reward him even for seeming trifles.  Secondly, this is a pleasant surprise when, together with standard rewards, you get an unexpected bonus in the form of an interesting new thing or unexpected gaming capabilities. <br>  This is all achieved through sophisticated innovative gameplay that creates <b>emotional</b> player <b>involvement</b> , i.e.  <b>self-expression through communication</b> .  For social players, <b>knowledge of their current status and progress in the game</b> (awareness of their own coolness) is no less important than knowledge of their next in-game goal and methods for achieving it.  Social game should <b>compress the gameplay (12)</b> in a few clicks, and tell the rest. <br><br>  12. Gameplay is a term used in the field of computer games to refer to the actual gameplay from the player‚Äôs point of view. <br><br>  When creating gameplay for our game, we will be guided by the mechanism of the game for the social network, based on the following <b>principles (13) of</b> <b>game design (14)</b> , designed to give players a sense of fulfillment of their desires, explicit and hidden: <br>  1) <b>Sociality</b> <br>  2) <b>Spontaneity</b> <br>  3) <b>Symbolic touch.</b> <br>  4) <b>Narration (narration of events)</b> <br>  5) <b>Asynchrony (breaks in the gameplay)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/64d/6cf/cc9/64d6cfcc9697ce582044337a48f58861.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Figure 12 The mechanism of the game for the social network <br><br>  The social cycle is facilitated by rewards and a sense of progress in the game, ease of development, coupled with a reckless approach, "playful" means of communication and exchange of things, the opportunity for the player to build a reputation for themselves and encourage the involvement of friends in the game. <br>  Orange arrows - cyclical gameplay;  with each new turn of the spiral, the player gets an ever higher status among his friends and by in-game metrics. <br>  Key mechanic design is an essential part of design.  Key mechanics are those that players repeat over and over. <br>  Combinations of <b>game mechanics</b> are used to achieve the player‚Äôs <b>goals</b> set by the designer.  <b>Fidbek</b> is a service that monitors <b>how a</b> player accomplishes goals and compares his results with the results of other players, and the reaction of the community (other players) to the player's actions. <br><br><h6>  13 Principles - combining aggregate facts. <br>  14 Game design - the process of creating content and game rules;  subspecies of communication design, facilitating the interaction of the player and games.  Design is a creative activity, the purpose of which is to determine the formal qualities of products.  These qualities include the external features of the product, but mainly those structural and functional relationships that make the product into a coherent whole, both from the point of view of the consumer, and from the point of view of the manufacturer. </h6><br><br>  The principles of game design are achieved through the following game mechanics: <br><br>  1. <b>Sociality</b> - the game should be completely social, that is, such a single player using friends as an additional resource, which means communication and interaction with friends (for example, the ability to steal from friends, go to their farms or stupidly send gifts) <br>  1.1.  Invitation to the game, which is impossible to refuse (not literally, of course) <br>  1.2.  Online and offline friends (or members of an interest group) - game teams / clans <br>  1.3.  Content and information in the "profile" of the player, focused on social connections. <br>  1.4.  Forming groups of players should be simple and intuitive. <br>  1.5.  Relations.  The game should support friends and encourage players.  Helped a friend - get a coin, brought a friend - hold two.  Married a friend inside the game - keep five more! <br>  1.6.  The competitive element of the game - you always want to be "cooler friends" <br>  1.7.  Intentionally not too serious (‚Äúfrivolous‚Äù) means of communication <br>  1.8.  The ability to create content based on the content of other users <br>  1.9.  The exchange of things is a structured form of social relations inherent in people since ancient times. <br><br>  2. <b>Spontaneity</b> - the ability to actively act under the influence of internal motives <br>  2.1.  "Casual" gameplay (random, transient, less demanding on the cost of forces on the game) and the study of the world (in one or two clicks) - allows you to bring into the game the largest possible number of players from different audiences.  You need to clearly maintain the border - the user came to look at your game, and not to play!  If everything is simple in it, he will linger to play.  If everything is complicated in it, he will leave the game. <br>  2.2.  Constantly complicating gameplay to keep the paying players as long as possible; <br>  2.3.  A mixture of genres - the use of the arcade part, strategy and RPG, which brings an element of novelty in the research of the game world; <br>  2.4.  Attraction and addictive.  The game must be built in such a way as to attract the player and make him constantly enter the game.  As options, this is a promotion at the entrance or an element of loss (friends will steal the harvest). <br>  2.5.  The infinity of the game - the game should not be the end.  For example, it is possible to ensure that the leaders of the ratings feel obliged to return and check whether someone has not managed to beat their record during the absence.  Achieving a record, therefore, becomes not the end of the game, but a pause until the next session. <br>  2.6.  Visual display of player in-game progress (a set of points) <br>  2.7.  Customization - the more a player changes his character / world ‚Äúfor himself‚Äù (invests time and energy), the more difficult it will be for him to leave.  ‚ÄúAutomatic‚Äù customization, depending on the user's actions, works just as well as personal.  The more a user can change the profile in the social network, the better. <br><br>  3. <b>Symbolic tangibility</b> - the ability of the game to be perceived by the user <br>  3.1.  Collecting things <br>  3.2.  The application should not "punish" for the experiments - the user should have the right to research and the right to make mistakes <br>  3.3.  Game rewards that can be shared (which can be donated) <br>  3.4.  Symbolic actions, like the button ‚Äúdrink from X to brotherhood‚Äù, ‚Äúpeck Y to cheek‚Äù <br>  3.5.  "Friends" in the social network, as a kind of necessary goods and services <br><br>  4. <b>Narration</b> <br>  4.1.  The story about the actions and results of the player‚Äôs actions to him - the player shouldn‚Äôt guess what to do next, he should smoothly go through ‚Äúdifficult moments of the game‚Äù. <br>  4.2.  Notifications about the actions and results of the player's actions to his friends - draws attention to the game <br>  4.3.  Use the statistics generated by the game to attract players. <br><br>  5. <b>Asynchronous gameplay</b> <br>  5.1.  Asynchronous gameplay allows multiple players to play one at a time, not simultaneously.  Time to move may vary from game to game.  You can play on one computer, device, one console or several. <br>  5.2.  Some degree of constancy.  An asynchronous gameplay requires a game world that is common to all players and is always accessible;  all players can influence events in it, it in turn saves at least some of these events and changes the state of the players according to them (as in the MMORPG). <br>  5.3.  The main feature of asynchronous multiplayer games is the gameplay, broken into many small gaming sessions.  In good asynchronous games, the breaks between the ‚Äúmoves‚Äù are not a boring obligation, but the central part of the gameplay.  Since in such games everything is kept on ‚Äúbreaks‚Äù, the default gameplay is more casual, it allows players to be more flexible in their decisions (as opposed to fussy RTS and multiplayer shooters).  In addition, since asynchronous games are designed for constant pauses in the gameplay due to the player's business in the real world, some of them "take into account" what is happening in the real world;  For example, if the yard is a winter night, then the game world will be dark and snowy. <br><br>  <b>As a result, evaluating the game using this system and maximizing all the indicators, we will get the most competitive game.</b> <br><br><h4>  5. Backtrack analysis </h4><br><br>  Let us show how the theory of principles of successful implementation developed by us is applied to the indicators of the past in order to evaluate its ‚Äúpredictive‚Äù capacity for future events in the past.  In general, we prove that the evaluation system works! <br>  We will take two games as a basis - bright representatives of different degrees of successful implementation and we will carry out an expert assessment on all indicators from the ‚ÄúImplementation‚Äù section. <br>  Bottom line: the evaluation system showed that in fact the more successful game in the ‚ÄúDig‚Äù market is more successful in our rating system. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a1/316/7f0/4a13167f0e1b5d690bc4b453c3fceb9d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Table 1 Basekrek analysis based on expert assessment of the gameplay indicators system <br><br><h4>  6. Business model </h4><br><br>  <b>Business model</b> - free-to-play: you can play for free, but for additional benefits: armor, weapons, tips - players need to pay. <br><br>  <b>The main product</b> is virtual goods that give advantages in the game. <br><br>  At first, the game should be with an extremely simple interface, elementary control (with one mouse button), rules that can be learned immediately after launch. <br><br>  For example, you run the game.  And make an insidious first click.  Then, partly down, you delve into the essence, you snivel - ‚Äúit's too simple‚Äù to make sure, you start another level, the next one.  But what is it?  Thirty minutes have passed.  The end of the free "first dose".  Here the monetization system enters the battle, giving you the opportunity to acquire additional energy or a weapon that makes you ‚Äúcooler‚Äù than friends or speed up gameplay.  And you, just like a 14-year-old schoolboy, are already sending sms to the coveted number.  Spitting on these 170-200 rubles payment. <br>  <b>The average check</b> is how much a player is willing to pay per month - on social networks it is less than in regular online games: now for Russia this figure is $ 5 per month for paying.  The number of paying players is 3% of the number of people who installed the application.
