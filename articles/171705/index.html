My Samsung 9-series (2011) has turned from an ultrabook to an ultratop: there are no spare parts, and the price of repair is comparable to buying a new laptop, and in general.  A friend came to the rescue, giving for a few days the rather unusual Fujitsu Lifebook U-Series, the impressions of which I decided to share today.  Why?  Yes, if only because about the laptops of all the other companies on Habr√© are full of reviews, and what Fujitsu does there many do not even know. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8fc/e4a/5c0/8fce4a5c0047994228355ccfa554ee30.png"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It‚Äôs worth starting with the fact that this notebook doesn‚Äôt fit into the concept of ‚ÄúUltrabook‚Äù, despite the corresponding sticker on the case - it's all about the dimensions and weight, which are somewhat different from the conventional ones.  At the same time, the filling, performance, and application areas fit well into the generally accepted ultrabooked framework.  In my ‚Äúlaptop for hire‚Äù there was an Intel Core i5-3317U (1.7 GHz to 2.3 GHz in turbo mode), 4 gigabytes of RAM, a built-in Intel graphics chipset and a hybrid disk system.  The set is ultrabook, except that instead of a low-capacity SSD there is a 500-gigabyte HDD from WD, and with it - 32 gigabytes of the caching SSD from SanDisk.  Quite a good symbiosis - during the time of use, I have never encountered a slow exit from the "sleep" (or the entrance to hibernation).  The laptop responded with a login-screen from the moment of opening the lid, but calmed down a second after it was closed, so I consider the installation of such a system justified, and most importantly - it is clearly not a bottleneck.

    <h4>  Appearance and design features </h4><br>  The body of the Lifebook is made using two materials.  The outer side is aluminum and silver, and the inner side is plastic and black.  On the lid embossed logo embossed in the form of a stylized infinity icon ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3ca/a96/6a3/3caa966a3bbc323fe337a7c255b1e56f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d61/1bf/a22/d611bfa229afd931abeb7ce8e417eac6.jpg"><br><br>  The bottom one is decorated with stickers with various kinds of information, technological slots and uncovered holes for screws and bolts fastening the base of the notebook. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/903/f84/240/903f8424097e3bf217f8118a9366b6dd.jpg"><br><br>  Severe German school of functional design;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f09/4a9/b1c/f094a9b1cdd08417489dd74eeff3bea0.jpg"><br><br>  Inside the design is also quite ascetic: a matte frame (very wide) of a 13-inch screen, a silver mesh of speakers, LED indicators of blue (aaa!) Color, a separate (large and comfortable) power button, keyboard and touchpad.  Many manufacturers have already managed to get rid of the stickers on the case, but here you are both ‚ÄúUltrabook, inspired by Intel‚Äù, and ‚ÄúCor Ay5 insider‚Äù, and ‚ÄúWindows 7‚Äù and even ‚ÄúMaid in Zormani‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/233/3ba/5db/2333ba5db915037759384d03570ec96c.jpg"><br><br>  And if the first three are monochrome and practically do not stand out against the background of a laptop, then the latter is like an eyesore.  On the other hand, there is something in it - taking into account that 90% of the rest of the laptops are made in the Middle Kingdom.  Okay, the moped is not mine, it's not for me to unstick the stickers;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/192/775/9a2/1927759a2b1d16f6dbdb0cf82a913f9e.jpg"><br><br>  All interface connectors are very well located on the sides of the laptop, closer to the screen hinges (which, by the way, are made of aluminum and look reliable).  Left: Kensington's lock, HDMI, two USB (3.0) and 3.5mm mini jack for headphones;  on the right - a card reader, another USB and an impressively sized power connector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cac/25c/572/cac25c57248c629df2eb7d28ce6bfc17.jpg"><br><br>  Looking at the latter involuntarily, it would be desirable if in Europe they were obliged to transfer not only all phones to MicroUSB, but they also invented some standard interface for charging for laptops.  However, the network adapter is quite small. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/18e/4b7/91c/18e4b791c0ffb94035bb3aa5fe8fa2c6.jpg"><br><br>  Included with the laptop is also a tricky USB-Ethernet adapter, although in the era of the ubiquitous Wi-Fi, a connector for wired networks on a mobile computer is not so necessary. <br><br><h4>  Screen </h4><br>  The screen is set to matte, 13-inch, resolution - 1366x768.  Not that I would be delighted with this resolution, but in my opinion, they saved a little on the matrix.  At the time of Windows-7 with scaling, it was still so-so, and with virtual resolutions that are installed on retinated MacBooks, Windows does not know how to work (so far), so the screen is like everyone else.  Letters of sufficient size to read without straining, the brightness margin is good, the minimum brightness is comfortable in almost any conditions (when working indoors), only a couple of times I added brightness up to 2-3 values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom the minimum ‚Äî on a sunny day I sat with my back to the window.  Viewing angles are typical for TN-matrices of this price range, vertical - do not shine, clearly designed for ‚Äúcomfortable position of the screen‚Äù (a deviation of more than 10-15 degrees from the normal gives a noticeable color distortion).  The horizontal angle allows you to watch the movie in two or three, and you don‚Äôt need a bigger screen like this: it‚Äôs not suitable for working with graphics because of the iron, and for watching a movie in a large company - because of the diagonal. <br><br><h4>  Keyboard and touchpad </h4><br>  In my case, the laptop was without a localized keyboard, that is, except for English letters and symbols, nothing was put on it;  at the same time, the keyboard layout is closer to the ‚ÄúEuropean‚Äù standard - with a strange backslash position near the left shift. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2de/fe6/028/2defe6028e41824204749a356799c0f7.jpg"><br><br>  I did not like the location of the home-end-pgup-pgdn buttons - they are arranged in a logical order, but the place was not chosen very well - when typing on the machine, you drag to delete, located behind Enter, and you get into PgUp.  After some getting used to mistakes, you don‚Äôt make mistakes, but if you sit behind the desktop for a bit, the motor error pops up again and again. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e40/d15/566/e40d1556618b3d38b656c840f0bca326.jpg"><br><br>  But I was pleased with the block of arrows - it is slightly displaced downward relative to the general block, and the keys have reasonable sizes: at least there were no distortions in the face of ‚Äúhalf-cutting‚Äù vertical arrows and pressing them into the height of horizontal ones. <br><br>  The touchpad is a matte one, the finger slides perfectly along it, multitouch gestures are supported (recognized with a bang, not a macbook, of course, but still much better than many other laptops I have dealt with).  The buttons are hidden under the touchpad itself and do not have a pronounced outline: clicked on the lower left corner - LKM, on the right - RMB.  In general, laptop management is implemented on 4 with a slight plus: the keyboard is a matter of habit, (people get used to the layout of all kinds of MacBooks), and the touchpad does not cause the desire to connect a mouse - it‚Äôs quite convenient to work with the browser, documents and everyday applications, and no one requires. <br><br><h4>  Performance and stuffing </h4><br>  The stuffing, which means that the performance is typical for ultrabooks, but for objectivity, here are the results from 3D news, I, nevertheless, worked with a laptop, and did not drive benches: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6cc/818/9e3/6cc8189e33f42b0e1336af00acafbc54.png" alt="image"><br>  <sup>(Envy has a more final result due to SSD-disk by 128 gig instead of hybrid five-hundredth)</sup> <br><br>  It was even possible to launch Diablo 3 (the client dropped out of the laptop‚Äôs owner), but you can only play with extra human patience: at the minimum settings, the performance drops below a comfortable minimum as soon as you see the high-level character on the screen;  pre-emptiness shots, readiness to die in lags and hope for friends in a group is your everything.  However, this laptop is not positioned as a gaming one, and I don‚Äôt know a single ultrabook with discrete graphics that is any different in performance from the HD4000. <br><br>  Exhaust and ventilation are well equipped.  The noise of the cooler is audible, but the laptop always remains at a comfortable temperature: it does not burn your knees and does not heat sandwiches with a stream of hot air. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/856/eed/956/856eed956bf9fee8b97ce4817f7559c3.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Autonomy </h4><br>  The laptop has a typical for the average "ultrabook" battery: 42 Wh.  Three to four hours of active work with wireless interfaces and you can recharge.  In the ‚Äúno network‚Äù mode, with minimal brightness and undemanding tasks, I think you can squeeze for six hours - did not try. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/445/3c6/bb9/4453c6bb9201dab871ff1ec395c824f6.jpg"><br><br>  Again, we thank 3D news for the benchmark results: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/799/5af/545/7995af545ab60ca5457fe2800faa0676.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br>  The laptop helped me very much, but this is not a reason to change the impartiality in assessing such a device.  Equipment always remains a technique, and its quality, characteristics and capabilities can always be evaluated and compared. <br><br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br><ul><li>  body materials </li><li>  matte screen </li><li>  location and port set </li><li>  comfortable touchpad </li><li>  performance and volume of the hybrid disk subsystem </li><li>  unobtrusive and smart built-in software for FN buttons </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br><ul><li>  keyboard <i>(layout from German geniuses could be more comfortable)</i> </li><li>  matrix <i>(a laptop is not three hundred bucks worth it, I would like more resolution, 1440x900 would be super)</i> </li><li>  GPU performance <i>(it's time for Intel to learn from AMD in the field of hybrid solutions, their integrated graphics chips are much more interesting and powerful)</i> </li><li>  battery life <i>(I want +2 hours to the ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù and ‚Äúnetworkless‚Äù modes, 2013 is the year of the court, after all)</i> </li></ul><br><br>  <sup><b>ps:</b> I ask pardon for the photo, it was photographed then on the shoe, then on a tube of toothpaste.</sup> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/171705/">https://habr.com/ru/post/171705/</a></p>
