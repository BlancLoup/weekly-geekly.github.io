  <section class="page js-page"><h1>European rules and post-Soviet programmers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We have recently been working with the Swedes, we are jointly creating a fashionable mobile tool for learning Swedish.  You have to talk a lot with one of their project managers.  Somehow they talked about the work of the Swedes with development teams from Russia, Ukraine, Belarus.  Yonas, the manager, voiced an opinion that I have heard many times from foreign customers.  It looked like this: ‚ÄúYou are great specialists, but you do not know how to work in teams with European developers and customers.‚Äù <br><br>  The topic is not new, but not so popular lately.  A new generation of IT specialists is growing up, who diligently learn English (and even German), they know what a code convention is, they are not too lazy to fill in task managers, use SVN and conduct business correspondence with customers.  This is actively promoted by foreign employers: choosing CIS teams as performers, they clearly state a number of rules for a hired team and in case of non-compliance refuse to pay.  You can understand them, they are often burned. <br><br>  In short, slowly but surely, we are moving from the level of ‚Äúhandicraft‚Äù production to civilized work.  Outwardly, our relations with partners are similar to professional foreign ones, but I noticed several features that significantly distinguish "us" from "them."  First, our behavior at rallies about the projects.  Business communication of "foreign" colleagues is replete with phrases like "Sounds good", "Good \ great work!".  Regardless of whether it‚Äôs true that it sounds good, or if serious work has actually been done.  Their strategy is positive communication.  More precisely, a positive direction.  They encourage, support and never go beyond the framework of a positive light business language in discussions.  And what are we doing?  And that we just do not do.  From us, positive assessments of their work will not wait.  If you are dissatisfied with something, raise the tone or speak out harshly.  We have our own opinion about everything, which we consider indisputable.

      The second problem is the level of English.  Yes, we learned it.  But how!  A limited set of words, the lack of a normal pronunciation, the inability to impose sentence construction.  On the customer side, this usually looks, to put it mildly, unprofessional.  Another popular tradition.  We love abruptly, without warning, to switch to Russian at the height of the rally and begin to actively discuss something, argue about something.  And we absolutely do not care what foreign colleagues say at this time. <br><br>  In short, comrades.  We have no ethics of business communication.  What to do with this on the scale of at least one individual company - I won‚Äôt attach my mind.  And if something in one company changes, the reputation of the post-Soviet teams will not improve.  Changes are needed global, at the level of learning ethics of business communication in institutions and universities. <br><br>  Have you noticed this? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/62373/">https://habr.com/ru/post/62373/</a></p>
