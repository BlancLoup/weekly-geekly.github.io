But how much does it mean when it comes to finding a job, or at least getting rid of offers from recruiters in the mail. <br><br>  A letter from Google is immediately marked with an asterisk, entered into your favorites and, possibly, you will show it to your grandchildren, but the offer from a Russian bank will most likely cause slight irritation and go to the basket.  Why is that?  Let's be fair, Russian banks offer interesting and large-scale IT projects, but everything breaks down on the crooked career sites, inconvenient forms of sending resumes, monotonous letters of recruiters and uninteresting social networks.

      The last two or three years, the situation began to change for the better: Euchars realized that most employers offered similar conditions for IT specialists, plus or minus, that you should not be hooked when you send mass mailings to exhausted java developers, but much earlier.  The most fertile ground for creating or adjusting an HR brand is students, they have not yet formed a market view and bitter experience of disappointing interviews.  This should be used. <br><br>  For example, the energy company ABB realized that they needed more female engineers for a healthy atmosphere.  This is not a company whim, but rather a general trend in the European market, where gender equality issues are very acute. <br><br>  Instead of the company's standard booth at career fairs in Europe, there was an unusual photo booth, in which software visual recognition was embedded.  The camera recognizes the gender of the student by face: the girls receive three photos and an invitation for an internship with a QR code leading to the site, and the guys are just a set of four photos. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ABB company and entertained visitors of the fair, and showed that it can make technological solutions, and gathered a solid base of warm contacts.  This single action will not give ABB the title of the best company for female engineers, but as a first step towards creating a similar HR brand, it‚Äôs not a bad idea for yourself. <br><br>  Another case is a German bank, which decided that they urgently need to open an IT department in Moscow.  Problem: no one heard about the company and its projects, there are no physical departments in the city, but talented students need to be lured for an internship. <br><br>  Instead of bombing the distribution of databases of technical universities, it is possible to conduct a partisan campaign.  At selected universities, the company installed broken coffee machines.  The bank was looking for novice java developers, so the story of coffee fit in here perfectly.  A string of Java code with an error was displayed on the main screen. <br><br>  Not indifferent students quickly found it, corrected, received coffee as a reward and an offer to undergo an internship - it was enough to leave their mailing address. <br><br>  Moreover, the bank closed all internship and junior positions, as well as 3,000 potential developers learned about the bank's products and development prospects in it. <br><br>  So, it is not so difficult to change or build the image of the company, even if it is a Russian bank with a well-established reputation.  It is only necessary to know your audience well, its needs, pain and to abandon the trivial way of leaflets, banners, career pages and bombing vacancies. <br><br>  PS Will it work if there are no interesting projects and decent conditions?  Not!  When there is nothing standing behind a beautiful wrapper, disappointment is inevitable. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/358370/">https://habr.com/ru/post/358370/</a></p>
