Text and detailed video review</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img title="Google nexus s" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e0a/bae/312/e0abae312e1391452b13a2c1340ee34b.jpg" alt="Google Nexus S" width="590" height="393"><br>  Finally, we got a very special ‚ÄúGoogle Phone‚Äù in our hands, because Google Nexus S is backed up by official support from Google.  Even before the announcement, from the leaked photos, we knew that Samsung was preparing the second Nexus and drawing it not from scratch, but from the patterns of the most popular Galaxy S model. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  What is the "salt" </h2><br>  From this situation, it is clearly seen that Google is not experimenting with tomorrow.  Samsung has a model that has been tested by time and millions of users, which, despite a certain age, is still the benchmark for performance.  Why not make a smartphone-face of the company based on this model?  After all, so Google insure themselves against possible childhood diseases or problems discovered.  For the official smartphone, which is not two or three, but one, it is not permissible. <br>  On the other hand, Nexus S is replete with novelty, because it does not focus on iron.  Let's reason, is it worth chasing iron?  You have not had time to start dreaming about the super-powerful Android smartphone based on the Tegra 2, as the information about the next generation, the Tegra 3, is already flying. Conclusion - it is unlikely that we will be able to manage the development of components and technologies.  If you're not an Engadget browser, of course. <br>  I realized a long time ago that the most important indicator of the utility and relevance of a gadget is software.  How many smartphones do you know that were released as top-end ones and could remain them, but because of the old OS version they graze the back?  For example SE X10.  After all, a good smartphone, but only recently received an update to Android 2.1.  SE will not release more official updates for it.  And Motorola Milestone?  This is literally the companion savior of the company, and to Android 2.2 has not been updated. <br>  Using some time smartphones on Android, I realized that the whole "salt" is in the updates.  And do not kick the operating system, because by itself it is in no way to blame.  If iOS had more than one carrier among smartphones, but 10 and all from different manufacturers, it would be the same.  Despite all the "sores", the first official smartphone of the search giant could always boast the latest updates.  Now the same fate shines and the Nexus S. In a rather short period of time that I use a smartphone, Android has already been updated twice, now the Android 2.3.2 is installed on the Nexus S, and everyone else envy me. <br><br><blockquote>  <em>Let us draw a line under all the above.</em>  <em>Google Nexus S is one of the most productive Android-based smartphones today and is positively distinguished from the army of smartphones on this OS by official Google support.</em> <br></blockquote><br><h2>  Nexus S Design </h2><br>  Now take a look at the smartphone itself.  The first thing I have to mention is gloss.  At least everyone starts with this.  Yes, the case is glossy.  The front side is great, no complaints about it, but the back cover is prone to slapping and scratching is much stronger than many other devices.  However, if you have never held a smartphone in your hands - do not put a cross on it because of this.  After receiving the Nexus S, I realized that the problem was more bloated.  I do not condone Samsung and it would be really more pleasant to feel aluminum or, at least, a soft touch in the device for $ 570.  Remember, the back cover can be acquired. <br>  And to the front side there are really no complaints, and it looks cool.  The fact is that the ‚Äúface‚Äù of the smartphone is completely black.  In the locked state, even the control keys are not visible.  There is no Samsung logo, only the speaker will help to understand what is up and what is down.  This option I really like and does not bother. <br><img title="Google nexus s" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/625/88c/81f/62588c81faa2c600b4f1457d30c2edfd.jpg" alt=" Google Nexus S" width="400" height="496"><br>  Also, many already know that the surface of the screen has a bend.  The semantic load is the following - try to feel the difference.  Perhaps this is more of a marketing move than a practical improvement.  Many who took me to see the Nexus S, the first thing considered exactly the curved screen.  But, to use it (subjectively) is convenient.  Scrolling is somehow more comfortable, and near the ear the phone is generally as made to order. <br><img title="Google nexus s" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/17f/e52/eeb/17fe52eebeff72bbebd43d6dacea2af8.jpg" alt="  Google Nexus S" width="590" height="274"><br>  If you compare the design with the Samsung Galaxy S, I like the Nexus S more.  The signs are given a stylish front of the smartphone.  But this is not all change.  I can not say that smartphones are almost identical in appearance.  Moreover, when they say this to you - do not believe it!  The Nokia 5230 and 5228, the iPhone 3G and the iPhone 3Gs, the entire Peugeot range, are almost identical.  You can still remember something.  And Galaxy S and Nexus S are smartphones of the same manufacturer.  It is perfectly normal that they have similar features, this is a corporate identity! <br>  I will say personally.  When ordering a Nexus S, I consoled myself with the support of Google, mentally preparing myself for a terrible body.  Using the device for a while I will say - relax, there is nothing screaming.  And the design is concise and pleasant. <br>  Another thing - in some respects, the Nexus S looks simpler than the Galaxy S. For example, the Galaxy has a slot for MicroSD memory cards, the Nexus has only 16 GB built-in;  Galaxy has a radio; Nexus doesn't;  Galaxy shoots video at 720p, no Nexus;  Galaxy uses Gorilla Glass; in Nexus, we still don‚Äôt know for sure what, but not Gorilla for sure. <br>  For some, these indicators can be decisive, so I will go over the points briefly.

    <ul><li>  No memory card slot.  If you regularly take out the card for various purposes and it is convenient for you - refer this item to the minuses.  I wondered if I got the card for once.  Not.  A 16 GB of memory is enough to head. </li><li>  The radio may be wired at the program level.  In this case, it will appear in custom firmware.  Again, do you use the radio? </li><li>  The camera module in the Nexus is the same (from many sources) as in Helexy.  So, or the video will be written better in the next updates, or in custom firmware. </li><li>  Gorilla is good.  But there is not any information about what is in the Nexus.  Maybe this coverage is no worse.  We learn over time. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Arrangement of elements </h2><br><br>  There is nothing on the front side.  Just pressing the unlock key you will see here the display Super Amoled, a diagonal of 4 "and with a resolution of 480x800. The screen is good, does not completely blind in the sun. But there is also a lack of Amoled technology - graininess. The pixels are clearly separated from each other and, if you look closely, it is visible. In everyday use there are no problems. <br>  In Russia, the Nexus S will be sold with a different screen - Super LCD.  This screen is a little better for reading, because you can not see the points, but the sun fades very much. <br>  Also located in front of the control unit of the four touch keys.  They really are not visible at all in the locked state. <br><br><img title="Google nexus s" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/073/3de/c9c/0733dec9cc28cfb6d48682991eb1451c.jpg" alt=" Google Nexus S" width="590" height="392"><br><br><img title="Google nexus s" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/52c/aa8/ae5/52caa8ae5cf6f5593fac69da7d54c69d.jpg" alt=" Google Nexus S" width="590" height="432"><br><br>  Note that the order of key placement is a bit unusual.  The house is now on the right side. <br>  Above the screen is a front camera that captures photos and videos in VGA resolution, speaker, light and proximity sensors. <br><br><img title="Google nexus s" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/869/370/cb4/869370cb4ca5b10a71fd11d4dbd31048.jpg" alt=" Google Nexus S" width="590" height="328"><br><br>  Not moving away from the topic, where did the diode alerts?  Really I do not understand why it is not, because it is very convenient to learn about the missed events by looking at the phone.  Now you have to press the unlock key. <br>  On the right side we see the power key and lock screen.  It is bigger and more convenient than the Galaxy S. <br><br><img title="Google nexus s" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bb1/a76/a72/bb1a76a7230b4ebc8663e5e7713105a2.jpg" alt="  Google Nexus S" width="590" height="301"><br>  On the left is the volume button.  It is also more convenient than its predecessor. <br><br> <a href=""><img title="Google nexus s" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ec/c5d/5de/2ecc5d5de133bb460d2b976aa29ab712.jpg" alt="  Google Nexus S" width="590" height="282"></a> <br>  Standard headphone input, for some reason, from the bottom.  There is also a microUSB cable input and a microphone. <br><br><img title="Google nexus s" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ea/52e/a46/0ea52ea46c453be0d29de2bfff7c730a.jpg" alt="  Google Nexus S" width="590" height="385"><br>  At the back we see two logos, a speaker and a camera with a flash.  The camera has a resolution of 5 MP, and the video shoots in the resolution of 720x480.  Despite the presence of a flash, the camera turned out to be simpler than on the Galaxy S. This applies to both settings and features.  For example, the video is not written in 720p and there is no autofocus when shooting a video. <br><br><img title="Google nexus s" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/07d/3b8/c19/07d3b8c199572706827512ca9cb41d0c.jpg" alt="  Google Nexus S" width="590" height="541"><br><br><h2>  BY.  Android 2.3 </h2><br><br>  This is the strongest side of the Nexus S. Many changes in the new version of Android are discussed in the video review (at the bottom).  The interface has changed.  Though not globally, there are many changes.  Now using the ‚Äúbare‚Äù Android is not problematic and after the purchase did not become a question the first thing to put a launcher.  Let's be honest, more recently, a third-party Android launcher was needed as well as fish water. <br><br>  Tabs appeared in the call log.  If you called the same subscriber several times (for example, you could not get through), all calls will be grouped into one tab.  It's comfortable. <br><br>  Now you can fully control the charge of the battery, there is a detailed schedule.  The video shows. <br><br><img title="power" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cec/993/1f6/cec9931f63a8de74b25b629ef21624c1.png" width="288" height="480"><br>  There was a standard process manager, you can watch and stop running and cached processes. <br><br>  Pop-up windows are no longer white, but dark.  When you click on the menu, the item ‚ÄúApplication Manager‚Äù appeared on the working screen. <br><br><img title="2.3" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a6/d7a/27d/4a6d7a27d1b02ff35c87e5ca700a0df8.jpg" width="581" height="480"><br>  Greatly (completely) changed the standard keyboard Android.  She really became comfortable. <br><br><img title="Google nexus s" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/acc/413/c3a/acc413c3ad8376ee011b7eee57b43b9a.jpg" alt=" Android 2.3" width="441" height="278"><br>  Now you can copy the text by selecting a range, ticking it with sliders.  This is also a step forward. <br><br> <a href=""><img title="Gingerbread" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/077/1d1/a5f/0771d1a5f48bfcea0988598a9fe83896.jpg" width="496" height="303"></a> <br><br>  And many other changes, including support for NFC technology.  More and clearly can be seen in the video review. <br><br><h2>  Specifications </h2><br><br>  They really are one of the indicative today.  Yes, it is not the day after tomorrow, but it‚Äôs still enough for tomorrow.  So far, there is no such game for Android, which would put the Hummingbird duet and PowerVR SGX540 in bewilderment. <br><br>  If you combine it all with the latest version of the OS, is it worth saying how fast the Nexus is in everything? <br><br>  Autonomy is an interesting nuance.  The first day the Nexus barely survived until the evening in a completely moderate mode of use.  This is a bit upsetting.  As it turned out, the battery is very swinging after 1-2 cycles of discharge-charging.  Now the smartphone lasts two days at an average load.  This is very good, taking advantage of almost all top-end smartphones on Android, the Nexus‚Äôs autonomy is positive. <br><br>  GSM 850/900/1800/1900, WCDMA 900/2100 <strong>standards</strong> <br><br>  Android 2.3 <strong>operating system</strong> <br><br>  Cortex A8 (Hummingbird) 1000 MHz processor <br><br>  <strong>Video Accelerator</strong> PowerVR SGX540 <br><br>  <strong>Memory</strong> ROM 16 GB, RAM 512 MB <br><br>  <strong>Screen</strong> Super AMOLED, 4 ‚Ä≥, 480x800 points, touchscreen, capacitive <br><br>  <strong>Interfaces</strong> USB 2.0 (microUSB), Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR (A2DP), Wi-Fi 802.11 b / g / n <br><br>  <strong>Built-in</strong> 5 megapixel <strong>camera</strong> , autofocus, widescreen, flash, geotagging <br><br>  <strong>Battery,</strong> Li-Ion <strong>autonomy</strong> , 1500 mA ‚Ä¢ h, 1-2 days <br><br>  <strong>Additional</strong> GPS capabilities (maps preinstalled), MS Exchange, synchronization with Google services <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br><br>  Google Nexus S can not be called the perfect smartphone.  It is not equipped with the most powerful hardware, the screen resolution could be more, it has no memory card slot, radio, video capture at 720p, codecs, Gorilla Glass, a glossy case ... However, there will never be a perfect solution.  Why these points have been neglected, I will not tell you. <br><br>  Despite this, the Nexus S is definitely one of the most interesting solutions on the market today.  Is the Nexus S worth its money?  Here it must be remembered that the Nexus is provided with updates for the long term, and this is important.  If you are not tired of the race for the iron - perhaps the Nexus is not your option.  I'm tired of the expectations of the update, now I will aim only at the Nexus, who would not produce them in the future. <br><br><h2>  Google Nexus S video review </h2><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/pPMGyDE4qdQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhh2fmHmnf3LoIxbU89K8EEZDWarvQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112880/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112880/</a></p>
