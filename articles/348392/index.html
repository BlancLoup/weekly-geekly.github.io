  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The obvious benefit: how and why to use the service approach beyond IT (Part 2)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãapplying a service approach beyond IT is again in focus.  Previously analyzed: </p><br><ul><li>  why and who needs it; </li><li>  when it is time to restore order; </li><li>  how to do it. </li></ul><br>  Today I‚Äôll focus on the stages you manage to go through in practice while you are implementing a service approach to the company‚Äôs processes. <a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/347338/">In the previous article,</a> I presented IT recipes in the form of a ‚Äúrainbow of call management‚Äù scheme (including highlighting features of the stages of advertising, training, and reporting). </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mt/zp/h6/mtzph6vlfdhmgzscxdtcefbnw-0.jpeg"><br><br><p>  I will run over the rest: </p><br><ol><li>  Search internal customer. </li><li>  Modeling processes. </li><li>  Tool selection. </li><li>  Creating the right atmosphere. </li></ol><br><h3>  We are looking for an internal customer </h3><br><p>  What is an ‚Äúinternal customer search‚Äù?  In my opinion, this is an important stage. </p><br><p>  I like the parallel with medicine: only a serious health problem causes us to go to the doctors for an examination.  We ignore preventive examinations.  As the saying goes, "until the thunder clap ...". </p><br><p>  A similar situation with the "health" of many business processes.  Even if the head of the department is aware of the problems, he will not always talk about it.  And even more so to contact someone for help.  Most often silent and "treated" independently. </p><br><p>  Attempts by a business to conduct a survey using an internal or external audit, the introduction of lean manufacturing, or some other measures do not reveal all the problems.  Yes, and they are often aimed not at all. </p><br><p>  And here the IT manager or IT manager plays a key role.  Possessing knowledge of information systems, clearly understanding the essence of the service approach, he perfectly sees business problems that can be tried using ITSM methods.  If, of course, wants. </p><br><p>  Moreover, they can be solved pointwise, in steps, without taking radical measures.  He is more likely than others to know who to contact to help.  I emphasize - to appeal, and not to impose any decision.  You can not immediately a person, and even worse to publicly be startled by information like: <i>‚ÄúAnd I know that you have such and such a problem.</i>  <i>Do you want me to help you solve it? ‚Äù</i>  The effect will be completely reverse. </p><br><p>  What to do?  Where to try to hold such a conversation? </p><br><p>  People say that the main issues are resolved in the "smoking room".  But this is an image.  It is important to understand that the conversation is better to start in a convenient place.  This may be a lift, a queue to the dining room, at the bus stop.  In the place you can see where these "smoking rooms" are.  The main thing - do not be afraid to come up, start a conversation and bring it in the right direction.  In fact, find out what and where it ‚Äúhurts‚Äù. </p><br><p>  <b>An example from practice.</b>  Conversation with the chief accountant.  <i>‚ÄúColleague, I know that your department receives many applications for the preparation of acts of reconciliation.</i>  <i>How do you manage to cope with such volume in time? ‚Äù.</i> </p><br><p>  We asked about the problem absolutely harmless.  The question is asked - now we are waiting for an answer. </p><br><p>  <i>"Yes.</i>  <i>There are a lot of applications.</i>  <i>All people are busy, but still do not have time. "</i> </p><br><p>  Here it is.  It is time to offer a "medicine". </p><br><p>  <i>‚ÄúI suggest submitting applications for verification reports through the service desk system?‚Äù.</i> </p><br><p>  Next - the matter of technology. </p><br><p>  This internal customer search algorithm is called the ‚Äúfive P‚Äù method: </p><br><ol><li>  Come up </li><li>  To talk </li><li>  To listen. </li><li>  Offer (give it a try). </li><li>  Sell ‚Äã‚Äã(embed). </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mh/38/-e/mh38-esi4xbwwbi7lau_hcs-yx4.jpeg"><br><br><p>  How to approach, we already know.  Talk so that it does not look like a fist fight.  The art of conducting a conversation must be learned.  If you are listened to with "sleepy faces", then the result will be the same.  Capture the attention of the listener.  Yes, it is not easy.  You can only offer what you are sure of yourself. </p><br><p>  The implementation should not stretch for long periods.  Given that the tool is already there, you should start the functionality as soon as possible. </p><br><h3>  Modeling processes </h3><br><p>  With proper organization, this stage is a practically ready technical task for making changes. </p><br><p>  The customer is found, the problem is indicated.  Now it is important to quickly and without distracting the customer, to get a prototype of the technical task.  At this stage, we communicate with all key participants in the process. </p><br><p>  The first step before modeling is to familiarize yourself with the process on site.  I previously shared my experience, as in a large retail, I visited stores on my own and studied the application process in IT.  Then he analyzed the processing of applications by performers.  Only after that - time to model on paper. </p><br><p>  Start with the drawings.  You draw, the customer rules.  Put the words into a scheme that every participant can understand. </p><br><p>  <b>An example from practice.</b>  A project to automate applications for the repair and maintenance of equipment automation, based on the <a href="https://www.naumen.ru/products/service_desk/">service of science desks</a> .  Geographically distributed objects.  Participants of the process in the role of performers - more than 300 people.  At the start, the worker‚Äôs working day was studied: how he receives applications, how he reports on implementation, whether he uses the computer or decides everything ‚Äúin the fields‚Äù by phone.  Then, key employees were collected step-by-step along the objects and simply drew a scheme of the process on a whiteboard with their words.  In the process of discussion, the drawing took on the form of a scheme.  All comments and suggestions were taken into account.  Controversial issues were recorded separately for making management decisions.  On the basis of these figures, we prepared and agreed with the customer a scheme for the life cycle of applications, described the process. </p><br><p>  Performers with such an implementation is much easier to understand the essence of innovations.  The drawings created together made it possible to immediately remind each step of the process in the system. </p><br><p>  When modeling the process, do not load colleagues with diagrams, suggest simple drawings.  On these figures, work through all the questions.  And when the customer understood everything, shift his words to the scheme and prepare her description. </p><br><p>  Having a scheme and description of the process, in modern systems of the service desk class, it is quite easy and fast to create a new functionality. </p><br><h3>  Choosing a tool </h3><br><p>  This is not about the technical selection criteria and not about comparing the performance characteristics of various programs.  The emphasis is rather on the functional and psychological side of the issue. </p><br><p>  It's like with toys for kids.  If the toy does not like it, the child will never play it.  If the system or tool is inconvenient, it will not take root. </p><br><p>  Toys at different ages are different: sometime soft and fluffy, and sometime already big and iron.  We take into account the "age of the child" - the maturity of the organization.  Why use a powerful service desk to solve the simplest tasks?  Or vice versa.  Is it convenient in the regular mail to build the process of managing appeals in a large holding? </p><br><p>  Now about the functional purpose.  It is necessary to clearly understand what will be done by this tool.  How will it be serviced?  Do we need a Mercedes or just to get there?  And if - a Mercedes, then if there are resources for its maintenance and maintenance? </p><br><p>  <b>An example from practice.</b> </p><br><p>  <i>‚ÄúWhy do you need Service Desk?‚Äù</i> </p><br><p>  <i>"To manage programmers."</i> </p><br><p>  Do not hurry.  Consider all the arguments.  Perhaps a simple cloud solution is enough, or perhaps a whole project is needed involving a serious contractor. </p><br><h3>  Create an atmosphere in the team </h3><br><p>  They say that if you love what you do, you seem to not go to work. </p><br><p>  If you don‚Äôt believe in your business, how can you delight others?  The project leader is important.  This is a generator of ideas with a clear understanding of the tasks and the willingness to bring them to others.  It is he who will create the right atmosphere. </p><br><p>  I was lucky in this regard.  I like what I do.  And I clearly understand what exactly will give this or that change for the team of performers.  It remains to properly convey this to the team.  It is important to prepare the ground, but do not overdo it.  Do no harm. </p><br><p>  <b>An example from practice.</b>  Project implementation of incident management in IT companies in the oil and gas sector.  Among the performers is a communications engineer, a five-minute pensioner.  He immediately said that he saw the ‚Äúservice desk in one place‚Äù ... At that time, at the company, all the IT specialists at the end of the week filled out an ‚Äúmirror‚Äù of the working day in Excel - a report on their employment.  Their KPI and premium depended on it.  Already during the test operation period, I suggested replacing the report with data from the service desk.  As a result, the communications engineer was empty there.  His applications, resolved ‚Äúpast the box office‚Äù, I called ‚ÄúKalym‚Äù.  And for him the prize is not allowed.  Of course it was a joke.  But the goal has been achieved.  The next day he already explained to the users why it is necessary to make an order in the system. </p><br><p>  The search for like-minded people is necessary.  There are always.  And to involve in the discussion accounts for the most "obstinate."  There are cases when ardent skeptics become the first assistants. </p><br><p>  Another point is to dispel fear.  As a rule, people think like this: <i>‚ÄúThey will count us, then they will say that we are many, and most likely someone will be fired.‚Äù</i> </p><br><p> If there is fear, it must be dispelled.  Explain what the use of the tool will give to team members and customers, since  the right atmosphere is another key to successful implementation. </p><br><h3>  Summing up </h3><br><p>  I would like to finish the second part of the article not with general phrases, but with real history. </p><br><p>  The call of the head of the department: <i>‚ÄúDmitry, they say your service desk can solve almost any problems.</i>  <i>We really need your help. ‚Äù</i> </p><br><p>  I: <i>"Who says?".</i> </p><br><p>  Answer: <i>"The people speak."</i> </p><br><p>  It's nice, of course, but experience suggests: do not flatter yourself.  Find out everything.  Suddenly there is no question about that program. </p><br><p>  I ask: <i>"How can I help?".</i> </p><br><p>  Answer: <i>‚ÄúWe need to automate the process of managing requests of a certain type.‚Äù</i> </p><br><p>  Subject passed more than once.  The implementation process is simple.  After 10 minutes of clarifying the task, checking the current download, I say that after 5 days you will be able to test.  In the tube silence. </p><br><p>  I: <i>"Hello, are you here?"</i> </p><br><p>  Answer: <i>‚ÄúAre you kidding?</i>  <i>So fast does it happen?</i> </p><br><p>  I: <i>‚ÄúIt happens.</i>  <i>The process is similar already.</i> </p><br><p>  A week later, started to work.  Thanks were long.  The new information about the ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù went to the people. </p><br><p>  That's how we work.  Interesting.  With pleasure.  Delivering small joys to the customer and accumulating more and more experience in the practice of implementing a service approach.  These cases and share in the next article. </p></div>
