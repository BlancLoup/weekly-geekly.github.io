We share our opinions about the program, reports and atmosphere of the conference. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ddb/3c6/3b6/ddb3c63b65694d37be849a705e2f3c9a.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The conference lasted 2 days and took place in 5 tracks: 2 tracks with reports, 2 with workshops and 1 community.  Reports partially overlapped with the past I / O, for some of them it became clear how much Google has advanced in each of the disciplines.

Nexus.</i>  <i>For those inexperienced in graphical modeling, they presented a set of <b>Blocks</b> tools that helps to create 3D models.</i>  <i>The tempted is the proposed rendering engine <b>Rajawali</b> , and for the full Jedi left raw <b>OpenGL ES</b> .</i> <i><br></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/dd4/d78/654/dd4d786548414a78a2ffee892deefb3b.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/0fa/1fc/fea/0fa1fcfeafc5436ba7f5bd98fa0b6648.png" alt="image" align="left" width="200"><br>  <b>Dmitry Timoshilov ( <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/HellBurund/">@HellBurund</a> ), leading Android developer Redmadrobot</b> <br><br>  <i>Sundar Pichai believes that in the coming years, Mobile-first will change to AI-fst.</i>  <i>Google Assistant, a personal assistant, is one of Google‚Äôs key products in this direction.</i>  <i>It was introduced on Google I / O 2017, and now it is clear that Assistant is actively developing.</i>  <i>During the demonstration, Google Assistant looked amazing.</i>  <i>Developers go to ensure that the device can speak the same way as with a person: long or short phrases, without picking up words, to lead a full-fledged conversation.</i>  <i>Now long conversational phrases like:</i> <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúPlease let me know what the weather is about.‚Äù</b> <br><br>  <i>In this case, the Assistant takes into account the context of the conversation.</i>  <i>For example, if you ask:</i> <i><br></i> <br>  <b>‚ÄúTell me about Spartak football team‚Äù</b> <br><br>  <i>Assistant will tell about the team and its players.</i>  <i>To find out any details, it is not necessary to mention Spartak again.</i>  <i>Just ask:</i> <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúWhat is the stadium‚Äù</b> <br><br>  <i>and the assistant will tell you about the Discovery Arena, the team's stadium.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The context is also taken into account for correct speech recognition.</i>  <i>From several words similar to the ear, the system will select the one that best suits the topic of conversation.</i> <br><br>  <i>At the same time Assistant is embedded in the application.</i>  <i>If you say:</i> <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúOK Google, talk to ...‚Äù</b> <br><br>  <i>and call the application, control will be transferred to him.</i>  <i>You can learn more about how this works in the <a href="https://youtu.be/rdXR78bvXts">video from the conference</a> .</i> <br><br>  <i>Unfortunately, Assistant does not yet support Russian.</i>  <i>But, as managed to learn from the Googlers, support is planned.</i>  <i>It is hoped that it will appear within a year.</i> <br><br>  <i>Another of the loud themes of Google I / O 2017 is <b>Instant Apps</b> , applications launched directly from Google Play, without being installed on the device.</i>  <i>For a long time, the technology was in a closed beta, but now Googleers are ready to tell the details.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The essence of the technology is that when the user wants to use some function of the application, it does not load and is not installed on the device as a whole.</i>  <i>Google Play loads the module that contains the new feature, and it happens faster.</i> <br><br>  <i>The main thing that has to change is that the monolithic apk file is replaced by a zip archive containing several apk: one basic and one for each feature.</i>  <i>To do this, the application will have to be divided into modules by features.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>There is an important limitation.</i>  <i>The total amount of basic apk and any of apk with features should not exceed 4 MB.</i>  <i>For example, if the size of the basic apk is 3 MB, then the rest should be no more than 1 MB each.</i> <br><br>  <i>About Instant Apps left open questions.</i>  <i>How to make friends with this architecture with <b>Dagger</b> ?</i>  <i>How comfortable will the user go from the functionality of the already loaded module to the functionality of the not yet loaded?</i>  <i>How to combine Instant Apps modularity with <b>Clean Architecture</b> modularity?</i> <br>  <i>Read more about the implementation of <b>Instant Apps</b> <a href="https://youtu.be/8YxemdlSGts">here</a> .</i> <br><br>  In general, the conference was well organized and each participant could find something interesting for themselves.  Each participant received a gift IoT set. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d11/ffb/dcf/d11ffbdcfa154a97808c3f367b796cec.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/337742/">https://habr.com/ru/post/337742/</a></p>
