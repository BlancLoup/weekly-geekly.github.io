I spent a week and a half on it.  After reading this article, the same can be done in a day.  After that, the user will be able to continue to explore all the advantages of Android not from scratch, but from a reliable springboard :-). <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I have been a Symbian user for about 5 years.  Got used to a certain model of behavior when buying a new phone.  Oddly enough, it turned out that with Android phones everything is the same, but differently :-)

      I recommend all the first steps to do when you connect your phone to the Internet via Wi-Fi.  traffic can leave quite a large amount.  Connect simply.  In Settings -&gt; Wireless &amp; network settings, turn on wi-fi and then in Wi-Fi settings, connect to the network or add Wi-Fi network if the SSID is hidden. <br><br>  So‚Ä¶ <br><ol><li>  <b>No need to put any PC Studio from Samsung</b> .  In addition to problems with drivers on Win7 x64, I did not have them.  Drivers for the phone can be put in paragraph 2. </li><li>  <b>Phone firmware on 2.1</b> .  Despite the fact that many complain about 2.1, I upgraded and did not regret at all.  Everything works fast enough.  When reflashing, I used the instructions from here: <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D155452">http://w3bsit3-dns.com.ru/forum/index.php?showtopic=155452</a> .  There was a little crap with drivers for Win7 x64 but there everything is described in the topic.  <i>The author of this article is not responsible and all that ...</i> :-) </li><li>  <b>Connect to computer</b> .  This simple stage took me about an hour and a half.  I'm used to the fact that by connecting the USB cable to my computer and phone, I immediately have an external drive.  I was very surprised when this did not happen when the Android phone was connected.  For a long time I understood with the help of scientific tyke what did I do wrong  It turned out that when connected via USB, the card must be unmounted for use as an external drive.  After connecting the phone, a message appears in USB Connected.  You have to click on it.  A message appears prompting you to fix the disk.  After mounting an external disk appears. </li><li>  <b>Transfer contacts</b> .  If your contacts are normally maintained in an account on Google, then this item can be skipped.  I did not do that, so I had to tinker.  In Symbian, contacts are well synchronized with Outlook.  In Android - with a Google account.  I tried to look for tools to synchronize outluk with google but quickly did not find anything intelligible.  Therefore, I did everything in the forehead.  I export contacts from Outlook to CSV (File -&gt; Import and Eport ... -&gt; Comma separated values ‚Äã‚Äã(Windows) -&gt; Contacts).  In google made the import of this file (Cotacts -&gt; Import in the upper right corner).  When importing placed all contacts in a separate group.  Then it came in handy.  I was pleasantly surprised that Google remarkably perceived all the data from the outlook file. </li><li>  <b>Linking to an account: synchronizing contacts, setting up mail</b> .  Linking to an account is quite simple.  In the phone go to Settings -&gt; Accounts &amp; Sync -&gt; Add Account.  I have 3 accounts on google.  Therefore, it was important to set up where it comes from.  Click on the name of the account and choose what of this account to synchronize with the phone.  I chose that contacts were downloaded from one account, and mail from all.  You can also enable / disable Auto-sync to save traffic (if necessary).  Actually we start synchronization and we have contacts in the phone and mail. </li><li>  <b>Safety</b>  At this stage, having read the mail and thought a little, I realized that if the phone is lost (pah-pah-pah), then the enemy will get access to all my accounts.  Immediately decided to telephone the phone at least.  Settings -&gt; Location &amp; security -&gt; Require pattern. </li><li>  <b>Dialer</b> .  Having tried to dial some number not from the notebook I ran into the fact that several times instead of 0 I clicked on the call and realized that I could not use my native dialer.  After a brief search, <b>Dialer One</b> was found.  Here and further, all the mentioned programs are by name on the market and are installed in the standard way without additional gestures.  Advantages of Dialer One: squeak on a notebook in the style of push-button phones by letter, and not just by number.  More suitable for me numeric keypad.  When you first try to start the dialer, the system asks which zoning to use6 standard or Dialer One.  Choose Dialer One, check the checkbox to use it by default. </li><li>  <b>Ringer volume</b> .  The lack of profiles in the phone initially upset me.  It was impossible to turn on the vibration mode.  It was also annoying that the phone was on an incoming call, and especially at the alarm signal, at full volume.  It was solved with the help of <b>Ring Toggle</b> to change the modes of Ring &amp; Vibrate, Vibrate, etc.  <b>RingRiser</b> solves the problem with the increasing sound of the call. </li><li>  <b>Keyboard</b> .  The best that I found is the <b>Smart Keyboard Pro</b> and, accordingly, the Russian keyboard to it.  Download / read here <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D157565">w3bsit3-dns.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=157565</a> . </li><li>  <b>Internet access control</b> .  I was upset that by default, you cannot disable access to and-no through mobile networks.  After seeing how actively the phone pumps something from the Internet, I roughly calculated the bill from the operator and was even more upset.  But there is nothing unsolvable :-).  The APNDroid <b>program</b> makes it easy to enable / disable access to 3G / EDGE / GPRS.  There is a widget to display the current connection status.  In order to read the traffic I use the program <b>Smart Monitor Lite</b> . </li><li>  <b>Navigation</b>  Immediately without thinking put <b>Yandex Maps</b> .  I think that it is not necessary to explain what it is.  In addition, I downloaded the cache for the map from here <a href="http://ymm.sytes.net/ymm.asp%3Frubr_id%3D266">http://ymm.sytes.net/ymm.asp?rubr_id=266</a> to save traffic.  For car navigation on Navitel decided not to go bankrupt yet, put <b>iGo</b> .  Installation instructions here <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D147776">http://w3bsit3-dns.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=147776</a> and maps here <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fact%3DSF%26f%3D243">http://w3bsit3-dns.com/forum/index.php?act=SF&amp;f=243</a> </li><li>  <b>Miscellaneous</b> .  For work and other things, I set myself still such programs: <br><ul><li>  <b>NewsRob</b> - Google Reader Reader.  I like more than <b>Greed</b> . </li><li>  <b>Fring</b> - client for Skype (first of all) and also for heap IM. </li><li>  <b>Documents to go</b> - read PDF and office documents </li><li>  <b>PdaNet</b> is a program for connecting the phone as a modem via USB and Bluetooth. </li><li>  <b>Act 1 Video Player</b> </li><li>  <b>Meridian</b> is a media player.  Convenient in that it can play files in folders. </li><li>  <b>Google translate</b> </li><li>  <b>Exchanger</b> - currency rates. </li><li>  <b>Blue RSS</b> - for reading feeds that are not included in Google Reader. </li><li>  <b>Connect Bot</b> is a great SSH client </li><li>  <b>AK Notepad</b> - in my opinion a convenient program for short notes. </li></ul><br></li></ol><br><br>  This article is just my experience of using Android from scratch.  I hope it will help to avoid many rakes at the initial stage of mastering the apparatus and will allow to start using this miracle machine as soon as possible by 100%. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90075/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90075/</a></p>
