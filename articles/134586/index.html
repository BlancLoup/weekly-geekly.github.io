While our <a href="http://www.megaplan.ru/special/">big New Year's campaign</a> for new and current customers is underway, we decided to talk about what interesting things we are planning to do in 2012. <br><br>  In 2011, a <a href="http://www.megaplan.ru/blog/%3Fcat%3D13">lot of new and useful things</a> were done: we launched a new <a href="http://www.megaplan.ru/products/crm.html">CRM</a> , launched free products ( <a href="http://www.megaplan.ru/products/crm-free.html">CRM Free</a> and <a href="http://www.megaplan.ru/products/task-free.html">Task Free</a> ) for small companies, developed <a href="http://help.megaplan.ru/HELPReport">a report designer</a> , significantly improved the case module and <a href="http://www.megaplan.ru/blog/%3Fp%3D778">linked it to tasks and transactions</a> , introduced a <a href="http://www.megaplan.ru/blog/%3Fp%3D1307">new list management approach in the tasks</a> (on the queue customers and transactions), opened the Ukrainian and Belarusian representative offices. <br><br>  We have carried out substantial work on speed, have <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/php/119839/">introduced modern technologies based on erlang</a> .  This made it possible to achieve a quick response of the system in the most important scenarios: when writing a comment, setting a task, planning a case.  We consider speed to be very important for Megaplan and we will continue to spend significant forces on accelerating the program.

      What do we want to do in the coming year? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Mobile versions</b> <br><br>  In the spring of 2012, we will finally launch mobile applications for our products.  Work on the androind-version is already at the finish line, it will be launched first.  Work on iPhone / iPad applications in the middle of the road, launch is scheduled for spring.  Also, applications will be launched for other popular platforms throughout the year. <br><br>  Yes, I know that we promised to do it earlier.  We apologize to our users for the delay in terms, but we really want to make a really high-quality and useful product, and this takes time. <br><br>  <b>Products</b> <br><br>  Now the considerable strength of our grocery department is thrown on the creation of a new CRM.  It will be as simple as possible, focused on companies that currently do not use solutions for automating work with customers and sales and are still using Excel and paper. <br><br>  The new CRM will be simple, efficient and ‚Äúlicked‚Äù, with convenient settings ‚Äúby default‚Äù.  We pay great attention to the start of working with it and implement convenient mechanisms for importing all the necessary data, as well as other things for a ‚Äúquick start‚Äù (this, by the way, is called our internal project, ‚Äúquick start‚Äù in this direction). <br><br>  This product is ideal for small Internet companies, start-ups, web studios, etc. <br><br>  <b>Functional</b> <br><br>  We will continue to actively develop the functionality of existing products, as well as improve our interfaces.  Already at the beginning of the year we will implement some cool wow-functions for managing tasks that will significantly simplify the work.  There are a lot of improvements in our plans - we will announce them as soon as they are ready. <br><br>  <b>Integration</b> <br><br>  Year of the Dragon will be for us and a year of integration.  We will implement the necessary functionality, we will finalize the API for integration with a number of popular automation systems and online services. <br>  In the near future, we have tight integration with popular accounting systems, <a href="http://www.megaplan.ru/blog/%3Fp%3D1374">Astral products</a> , improved synchronization with Google calendar and social networks, workflow systems, postal services, software for working with call centers, etc. Perhaps we will launch a small market place where we will offer third-party "integration" developed by our partners. <br><br>  <b>Support and customer service</b> <br><br>  One of the main priorities of the company is to improve the quality of technical support and customer service.  Already in December, we significantly expanded the technical support staff, brought out new specialists (and we will continue to expand).  SLA, efficiency and quality of answers will be improved, a bunch of support with the development and the product department will be optimized. <br><br>  In the summer of this year, after the release of free products, we were faced with a sharp increase in the number of requests for technical support, which the current capacity did not cope with, which caused a certain delay in reaction speed.  Partially, this problem has been solved already now, but, of course, we are not going to stop there. <br><br>  <b>Geography</b> <br><br>  In the new year we are planning to open several more representative offices in the countries of the near abroad and eastern Europe.  This will significantly simplify the settlements and raise the quality of service for non-Russian customers. <br><br>  In addition, in 2012 we will launch a number of affiliate programs for companies that want to provide our services (both in Moscow and in the regions).  The mechanism and functionality of work with small and medium partners, as well as specials will be implemented.  conditions for large companies.  Already, by the way, telecom companies using Parallels Automation <a href="http://www.megaplan.ru/blog/%3Fp%3D986">can deploy an APS package</a> with our products <a href="http://www.megaplan.ru/blog/%3Fp%3D986">on their site</a> . <br><br>  <b>Marketing and Miscellaneous</b> <br><br>  In the spring, we will launch a new site, as well as substantially rework (composition and volume of materials, new cases, screencasts, recommendations, etc.) a section on user assistance. <br><br>  During the year we will launch new training programs and will hold mass seminars and mini-conferences for clients and partners.  We also really want to develop an external online test system (we already have an internal one) and launch certification of Megaplan end-users.  We think that our learning initiatives will outgrow the creation of a full-fledged ‚ÄúMegaplan Product Learning Center‚Äù. <br><br>  And, of course, wait for our appearances at all major industry conferences, we have a lot of new ideas;) <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  We are rapidly developing and are planning even higher growth rates in the new year.  Already, tens of thousands of users are already using Megaplan SaaS solutions in their daily work, making their lives easier.  We will try to make this number increase to hundreds of thousands and even millions.  And it is absolutely clear that this is impossible without a qualitative leap in the development of products and in the improvement of customer service ‚Äî which we will focus on. <br><br>  <i>Happy holidays to you, and may your megaplanes come true!</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134586/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134586/</a></p>
