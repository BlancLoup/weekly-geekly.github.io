  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fight TimeMachine's reluctance to recover data from a NAS device</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I have a great NAS server - iOmega StorCenter ix4-200d.  In all a wonderful thing.  Everything is able.  And there is enough space, and it works quickly.  I was enjoying myself quietly and did not know grief.  I used this device for several tasks: I had a file server on it, I saved the video and a photo archive for several years ... And then an old dream appeared in my life - Apple iMac 27 '' 2011 (MC813).  At once, another task on the server went down - creating a backup of TimeMachine. <br><br>  Everything was fine until I upgraded from OS X Lion to OS X Mountain Lion.  First, a couple of times TimeMachine informed me that, they say, I don‚Äôt see any previous backup at all, then I simply refused to archive the data on the NAS.  But, there was a new firmware for iOmega - and the problems were gone.  As I thought at that moment - forever.  Naive‚Ä¶ <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The backups continued to stack up perfectly on the NAS, any file could be easily restored from the TimeMachine interface.  All was good.  But the time has come for a brewing upgrade - the new SSD Vertex4 has asked to take the place of the main disk in the system. <br><br>  The problem of installing the disk did not cause any special problems - the necessary material was found in advance and the necessary cable was purchased on amazon.  The system at that time occupied about 150GB, and the SSD was 256GB.  Accordingly, there were two ways to transfer the system:

      <br>
    <ul><li>  disk cloning (but this is trivial) </li><li>  restore from TimeMachine backup (the path is simple and recommended by Apple) </li></ul><br><br>  It was decided to follow the recommendations of Apple.  Well, with God! <br><br>  Booting from a Mountain Lion distribution stick went great.  An item with a recovery from TimeMachine was selected, my TimeMachine was selected and ... in response, I get a window: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúThe version of the server you are trying to connect to is not supported.</i>  <i>Contact your system administrator for help. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  I tried to log in as root, and as a guest, I created new logins - zero sense.  Got to the Internet for a solution.  I saw that not only I have such problems, and people are trying to solve them somehow, but, basically, they have a window in the loaded system ... And I have it - in recovery mode!  There is nothing but a few tools at hand.  BUT, since I have been friends with the command line for a long time - I decided to try to get out in our way, admin-like. <br><br>  The problem, as I understood it, was that the work of the afp protocol (in terms of user identification) on the NAS and in the iMac itself was completely inconsistent.  The idea came quite simple - ‚Äúand what if we try to mount our TimeMachine through the terminal - maybe it will?‚Äù  No sooner said than done.  We go to the terminal butting. <br><br><pre><code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">#&gt; cd /Volumes</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  Go to the directory where, when booting, Mac mounts all partitions <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">#&gt; mkdir TimeMachine</span></span></code> </pre><br>  Create a mount point for our NAS TimeMachine locally <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">#&gt; mount -t afp afp://[]:[]@[..xx.xx - ip   NAS]/[  NAS,    TimeMachine] /Volumes/TimeMachine [    -  ]</span></span></code> </pre><br>  Actually we mount our NAS locally.  Depending on network speed, it may take some time.  It took me about 5 seconds with gigabit. <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">#&gt; ls -l /Volumes/TimeMachine [,     -  ,    - *.sparsebundle]</span></span></code> </pre><br>  Now we are looking for the name of the file in which the backups lie. <br><br>  Since TimeMachine works with an image (which is constantly growing), we need to mount it.  It will take more time, since the size of the image is rather big.  We are getting patience. <br><pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">#&gt; hdid /Volumes/TimeMachine/[ ].sparsebundle</span></span></code> </pre><br><br>  After that, another directory should appear in the / Volumes / TimeMachine / directory with the name "Time Machine Backups" <br><br>  Voila  After these rather long dances, access to NAS TimeMachine was obtained, and the disc was restored. <br><br>  I hope someone will benefit from this experience. <br>  Thanks for attention. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/170205/">https://habr.com/ru/post/170205/</a></p>
