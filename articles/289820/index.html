      Ilya says that the technologies of human communication, motivation and gamification have always caused the greatest interest in him, so he has high hopes for his current project. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>I was asked to give advice.</i>  <i>But I honestly doubt the essential value of any advice from one project founder to another.</i>  <i>The future is uncertain, and it is definitely not the past.</i>  <i>Take the recipe from the past and apply it to the future, and you will not succeed.</i>  <i>This is especially true of those who are really developing something new regarding innovations and start-ups.</i> <br><blockquote>  The best and smartest experts with a baggage of knowledge from the past are not able to evaluate promising ideas.  Everyone knows how Sergey Brin and Larry Page tried to sell their search to Yahoo!  and how they were ‚Äúrated‚Äù by the experts. <br><br>  Study the biographies of the most successful people and repeat.  See what happens.  I do not believe that there are any specific recipes for success, for each recipe, there is a story that refutes it.  Every successful person, the creator of the project, has its own unique success.  This is Tolstoy, all happy families are the same.  Successful people are just different. </blockquote><br><h4>  Probably you can select general principles.  The main thing is the attitude to risk </h4><br><blockquote>  A startup, any innovative project is a risk.  By definition.  Any business is a risk, but a startup is a squared risk. <br><br>  If you are not able to take the risk and live with it, or you have no idea how to live without knowing what the future will be tomorrow, then you don‚Äôt have to do it all. <br><br>  Entrepreneur startups, must understand the degree of risk.  Yes, the probability of project success is not high.  Yes, most likely nothing happens.  But after that you need to get these thoughts out of your head and stop doubting.  Doubts are very disturbing.  I saw people who continued to do projects and were tormented by doubts every minute. </blockquote><br><h4>  If you can accept the risk and start doing the project regardless of whether it turns out or not - ‚ÄúWellcome‚Äù </h4><br><blockquote>  The remarkable philosopher Kurt Vonnegut has such an idea with the name "WES", or "The Universal Striving for Realization."  The WES is that which creates the Universes from nothing, makes nothing persist in turning into something. </blockquote><br><h4>  In principle, I think it is: ‚ÄúThe Worldwide Striving for Realization‚Äù is characteristic of all living things and all people. </h4><br><blockquote>  Most are not trying to come true, to fulfill their desires, to create, to create ... because of fear.  Fear, as a force of friction, opposes the whole movement. <br><br>  Perhaps this is correct, everyone can not risk.  Civilization of people is enough that they risk a couple of percent, and success is achieved in hundredths of a percent. <br><br>  The rest simply replicate. <br><br>  But if in spite of everything, trying to be realized for you the main thing - just live it, casting aside doubt. </blockquote><br>  <i>Editorial note: if you have a desire to participate in the ‚ÄúFounder‚Äôs Tips‚Äù section, write to us at editor (at) megamozg.ru</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289820/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289820/</a></p>
