      As <u>practitioners</u> of project management, we strive to do what is right and honorable.  We set high standards for ourselves and we strive to meet these standards in all aspects of our life - at work, at home and in the service of our profession. <br><br>  The code of ethics and professional conduct describes our expectations from ourselves and our fellow practitioners in the global project management community.  The Code formulates the ideals to which we aspire, as well as the behaviors that are obligatory in our professional and voluntary roles. <br><br>  The purpose of this code is to instill confidence in the project management profession and help a person become a best practitioner.  We do this by establishing a professionally broad understanding of the appropriate behavior.  We believe that the credibility and reputation of the project management profession is shaped by the collective behavior of individual practitioners. <br><br>  We believe that we can advance our profession both personally and collectively by drawing up a Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct.  We also believe that this Code will help us in making wise decisions, especially in difficult situations where we may be asked to compromise with our honesty or our values. <br><br>  Our hope that this Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct will serve as a catalyst for others to study, discuss, and describe ethics and values.  In the future, we hope that this Code will ultimately be used to create and develop our profession. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>1.2 Persons to whom the Code applies</b> <br><br>  The code of ethics and professional conduct applies to: <br><ul><li>  1.2.1 to all <u>PMI members</u> </li><li>  1.2.2 Persons who are not members of PMI, but meet one or more of the following criteria: <br><pre>	 .1 not PMI members, but who have PMI certification
	 .2 not PMI members, but who have applied for PMI certification
	 .3 not PMI members, but who serve as PMI on a voluntary basis
</pre><br></li></ul><br>  <i><b>Commentary:</b> Individuals certified by the Project Management Institute (PMI¬Æ) (regardless of their membership) have previously met Project Management Professional (PMP), or Certified Associate in Project Management (CAMP) of the Code of Professional Conduct, and continue to comply with the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct of PMI .</i>  <i>In the past, PMI also had separate ethical standards for members and accredited individuals.</i>  <i>Stakeholders who contributed to the development of this Code concluded that having multiple codes would be undesirable and that everyone should meet the same high level.</i>  <i>Therefore, this Code applies to <u>PMI members</u> and individuals who have applied for or received a recommendation from PMI, regardless of their <u>PMI</u> membership.</i> <br><br>  <b>1.3 Structure of the Code</b> <br><br>  The code of ethics and professional conduct is divided into sections containing standards of conduct that were brought into line with the four values ‚Äã‚Äãidentified as the most important in the project management community.  Some sections of this Code contain comments.  Comments are not a mandatory part of the Code, but they are supplied with examples and other explanations.  Finally, a glossary can be found at the end of the standard.  Glossary defines words and phrases used in the Code.  For convenience, the terms that are defined in the glossary are underlined in the text. <br><br>  <b>1.4 Values ‚Äã‚Äãthat this Code contains</b> <br><br>  <u>Practitioners of the</u> global project management community were asked to determine the values ‚Äã‚Äãthat formed the basis for their decision-making and accompanied their actions.  The values ‚Äã‚Äãthat the global project management community has identified as the most important were: responsibility, respect, justice and fairness.  This Code establishes these four values ‚Äã‚Äãas its basis. <br><br>  <b>1.5 Desired and required behavior</b> <br><br>  Each section of the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct includes desirable and mandatory standards.  Desirable standards describe the behavior we seek to support as <u>practices</u> .  Although it is not so easy to measure compliance with desirable standards, it is expected that we should behave like professionals in accordance with them - this is not mandatory. <br><br>  Mandatory standards set firm requirements, and in some cases, practice restricts or prohibits conduct.  Practitioners who do not conduct themselves in accordance with these standards will be subject to a disciplinary procedure before PMI by the Ethics Review Committee. <br><br>  <i><b>Comment:</b> Behavior falling under desirable standards and behavior falling under mandatory standards are not mutually exclusive;</i>  <i>those.</i>  <i>one particular act or omission can lead to a violation of both desirable and mandatory standards.</i> <br><br><h4>  CHAPTER 2. RESPONSIBILITY </h4><br><br>  <b>2.1 Description of liability</b> <br><br>  Responsibility is our responsibility to personally take responsibility for decisions that we take or do not take, for actions we do or do not do, and for the consequences of this result. <br><br>  <b>2.2 Responsibility: Desirable Standards</b> <br><br>  How <u>practices</u> in the global project management community: <br><ul><li>  2.2.1 We make decisions and act based on the best interests of society, public safety and environmental protection. </li><li>  2.2.2 We only accept tasks that are consistent with our training, experience, skills and qualifications. </li></ul><br>  <i><b>Comment:</b> where developing and long-term tasks are considered, we ensure that key stakeholders receive timely and complete information regarding the gaps in our qualifications so that they can make their own decisions about our suitability for a particular purpose.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>In the case of a contractual agreement, we only subscribe to the work that our organization professionally performs, and we appoint only qualified professionals to perform the work.</i> <br><br><ul><li>  2.2.3 We fulfill the obligations that we undertake - we do what we say we will do. </li><li>  2.2.4 When we make mistakes or omissions, we take responsibility and make corrections as soon as possible.  When we detect errors or omissions made by others, we report them to the appropriate authority immediately after they are discovered.  We accept responsibility for any problems arising from our errors or omissions and any associated consequences. </li><li>  2.2.5 We protect proprietary or confidential information that has been entrusted to us. </li><li>  2.2.6 We support this Code and report to each other for it. </li></ul><br>  <b>2.3 Responsibility: Mandatory Standards</b> <br><br>  As <u>practitioners</u> in the global project management community, we require ourselves and our fellow practitioners to observe: <br><br>  <b>Regulations and legal requirements:</b> <br><ul><li>  2.3.1 We convey to ourselves and adhere to the policies, rules, regulations and laws that govern our work, professional and voluntary activities. </li><li>  2.3.2 We report unethical or illegal behavior to appropriate management, and if necessary, to victims of this behavior. </li></ul><br><br>  <i><b>Comment:</b> These provisions have several additions.</i>  <i>In particular, we do not engage in any illegal actions, including but not limited to: theft, fraud, corruption, embezzlement or bribery.</i>  <i>In addition, we do not accept or abuse the property of others, including intellectual property, and we do not engage in slander or slander.</i>  <i>In focus groups related to practitioners around the world, these types of misconduct have been identified as problematic.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>As practitioners and representatives of our profession, we do not forgive or assist others in engaging in illegal activities.</i>  <i>We report any abusive or unethical behavior.</i>  <i>Reporting is not easy and we are aware that it can lead to negative consequences.</i>  <i>From recent corporate scandals, many organizations have adopted policies to protect employees who have uncovered the truth about unlawful or unethical actions.</i>  <i>Some governments have also passed laws to protect workers who have come out with the truth.</i> <br><br>  <b>Ethics Complaints</b> <br><ul><li>  2.3.3 We report violations of this Code to the attention of the relevant authority for a decision. </li><li>  2.3.4 We file ethics complaints only if they are grounded in facts. </li></ul><br>  <i><b>Comment:</b> These provisions have several additions.</i>  <i>We cooperate with PMI regarding ethical violations and the collection of relevant information whether we are a plaintiff or a defendant.</i>  <i>We also refrain from accusing others of ethical misconduct if we do not have all the facts.</i>  <i>In addition, we conduct disciplinary actions against individuals who deliberately make false accusations against others.</i> <br><br><ul><li>  2.3.5 We conduct disciplinary actions against persons who retaliate against a person, causing ethical problems. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  CHAPTER 3. RESPECT </h4><br><br>  <b>3.1 Description of respect</b> <br><br>  Respect is our duty to take great care of ourselves, others and the resources entrusted to us.  The resources entrusted to us may be people, money, reputation, the safety of others, natural resources, or environmental resources. <br><br>  An atmosphere of respect engenders trust, self-confidence and the effect of superiority by strengthening mutual cooperation - an environment in which different points of view and opinions are encouraged and valued. <br><br>  <b>3.2 Respect: Desirable Standards</b> <br><br>  How <u>practices</u> in the global project management community: <br><ul><li>  3.2.1 We convey the norms and customs of others and avoid risky behavior, which others may regard as disrespectful. </li><li>  3.2.2 We listen to the opinions of others, trying to understand them. </li><li>  3.2.3 We communicate directly to those with whom we have conflict or disagreement. </li><li>  3.2.4 We behave in a professional manner, even if it is not reciprocated. </li></ul><br>  <i><b>Comment:</b> The meaning of these provisions is that we avoid participation in gossip and avoid negative comments in order not to undermine the reputation of another person.</i>  <i>We also have obligations under this Code to confront those who participate in these activities.</i> <br><br>  <b>3.3 Respect: Mandatory Standards</b> <br><br>  As <u>practitioners</u> in the global project management community, we require ourselves and our fellow practitioners to observe: <br><ul><li>  3.3.1 We negotiate in good faith. </li><li>  3.3.2 We do not use the power of our experience and do not influence the decisions or actions of other people in order to benefit from them. </li><li>  3.3.3 We do not act in an <u>abusive manner</u> towards others. </li><li>  3.3.4 We respect the property rights of others. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  CHAPTER 4. JUSTICE </h4><br><br>  <b>4.1 Description of Justice</b> <br><br>  Justice is our responsibility to make decisions and act impartially and objectively.  Our behavior should be free from competing own interests, prejudices and preferences. <br><br>  <b>4.2 Equity: Desirable Standards</b> <br><br>  How practices in the global project management community: <br><ul><li>  4.2.1 We demonstrate transparency in our decision making process. </li><li>  4.2.2 We constantly review our impartiality and objectivity and take corrective measures as necessary. </li></ul><br>  <i><b>Commentary:</b> Studies with practitioners show that the subject of a conflict of interest is one of the most difficult conflicts that our profession faces.</i>  <i>One of the biggest problems for practitioners is the message of not revealing when we have a conflict of obligations, but detection when we accidentally put ourselves and others in a conflict of interest.</i>  <i>We as practitioners should look for potential conflicts and help each other, emphasizing each other‚Äôs conflicts of interest and insisting that they be resolved.</i> <br><br><ul><li>  4.2.3 We provide equal access to information to those who are authorized to own this information. </li><li>  4.2.4 We give opportunities equally available to qualified candidates. </li></ul><br>  <i><b>Comment:</b> The meaning of these provisions is that, as a contracting organization, we provide the same access to information during the bidding process.</i> <br><br>  <b>4.3 Equity: Mandatory Standards</b> <br><br>  As practitioners in the global project management community, we require ourselves and our fellow practitioners to observe: <br><br>  <b><u>Conflict of Interest</u> Situations</b> <br><ul><li>  4.3.1 We actively and fully disclose actual or potential conflicts of interest to relevant stakeholders. </li><li>  4.3.2 When we understand that we have a real or potential <u>conflict of interest</u> , we refrain from the decision-making process and other ways to influence the results, until we make a full disclosure to interested parties;  we have an approved migration plan;  and to proceed, we must obtain the consent of the interested parties. </li></ul><br>  <i><b>Comment: A</b> <u>conflict of interest</u> occurs when we are able to influence decisions or other results on behalf of one party, when such decisions or results may affect one or more other parties with which we have competing dependencies.</i>  <i>For example, when we act as employees, we must be loyal to our employers.</i>  <i>When we act as PMI volunteers we <u>are required to be loyal</u> to <u>the Project Management Institute</u> .</i>  <i>We must distinguish between these divergent interests and refrain from influencing decision making when we have a <u>conflict of interest</u> .</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>In addition, even if we believe that we can set aside our shared obligations and make decisions impartially, we view the occurrence of a conflict as a <u>conflict of interest</u> and are guided by the provisions described in the Code.</i> <br><br>  <b>Favoritism and Discrimination</b> <br><ul><li>  4.2.3 We do not enter into or terminate, encourage or punish, or contract or refuse contracts based on personal considerations, including, but not limited to, favoritism, nepotism or bribery. </li><li>  4.3.4 We do not discriminate against others based on, but not limited to, gender, race, age, religion, disability, nationality, or sexual orientation. </li><li>  4.3.5 We apply the rules of an organization (employer, <u>Institute for Project Management</u> , or other groups) without favoritism or prejudice. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  CHAPTER 5. HONESTY </h4><br><br>  <b>5.1 Description of honesty</b> <br><br>  Honesty is our duty to realize the truth and act truthfully both in our connections and in our behavior. <br><br>  <b>5.2 Honesty: Desirable Standards</b> <br><br>  How <b>practices</b> in the global project management community: <br><ul><li>  5.2.1 We sincerely strive to understand the truth. </li><li>  5.2.2 We are truthful in our connections and in our behavior. </li><li>  5.2.3 We provide accurate information in a timely manner. </li></ul><br><br>  <i><b>Comment:</b> The meaning of these provisions is that we take the appropriate steps in order to ensure that the information on which we base or the decisions regarding or provision to others are accurate, reliable and timely.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>This includes the courage to report bad news, even if it can be badly received.</i>  <i>Also, when the results are negative, we avoid hiding information or shifting the blame to others.</i>  <i>When results are positive, we avoid taking credit for the achievements of others.</i>  <i>These provisions strengthen our aspirations to be both honest and responsible.</i> <br><br><ul><li>  5.2.4 We make commitments and promises, whether explicit or implicit, in good faith. </li><li>  5.2.5 We strive to create an environment in which others feel safe by telling the truth. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>5.3 Honesty: Mandatory Standards</b> <br><br>  As practitioners in the global project management community, we require ourselves and our fellow practitioners to observe: <br><ul><li>  5.3.1 We do not and do not tolerate behavior that is aimed at deceiving others, including but not limited to misleading or false testimony, half-truth, giving information out of context or hiding information that, if known, would make our statements misleading or incomplete. </li><li>  5.3.2 We do not engage in dishonest behavior for the purpose of personal enrichment or at the expense of others. </li></ul><br><br>  <i><b>Comment:</b> Desirable standards urge us to be truthful.</i>  <i>Half-truths and non-disclosure are intended to mislead the parties concerned, both unprofessional and constructively distorting.</i>  <i>We develop trust by providing complete and reliable information.</i> <br><br><h4>  APPENDIX A </h4><br><br>  <b>A.1 History of this Standard</b> <br><br>  PMI‚Äôs vision of project management as an independent profession began with our early work in ethics.  In 1981, the PMI Board of Directors formed the Ethics, Standards and Accreditation group.  One of the tasks that was required of the group was to discuss the need for an ethical code of the profession.  The team report contained the first PMI documented discussion of ethics for the project management profession.  This report was presented to the PMI Board of Directors in August 1982 and published as a supplement by August 1983 by the Quarterly Project Management. <br><br>  In the late 1980s, this standard turned into an Ethics Standard for Project Management Professional [PMP¬Æ].  In 1997, the PMI Council determines the need for members of a code of ethics.  The PMI Council formed the Ethics Policy Documentation Committee to prepare and publish an ethics standard for PMI members.  The Council approved the new Membership Code of Ethics in October 1998.  This was followed by the approval of Member Case Procedures in January 1999, which provided a process for submitting an ethics complaint and determining whether there was a violation. <br><br>  Since the Code was adopted in 1998, many dramatic changes have occurred in PMI and the business world.  PMI membership has grown significantly.  Big growth also occurred in regions outside of North America.  In the business world, ethical scandals have led to the fall of global corporations and non-profit organizations, causing public outrage and tightened standards by the government.  Globalization has brought economies closer together, but this has led to the realization that our practice of ethics may differ from culture to culture.  The rapid, sustained pace of technological change has provided new opportunities, but also introduced new challenges, including new ethical dilemmas. <br><br>  For these reasons, in 2003, the PMI Board of Directors called for a review of our codes of ethics.  In 2004, the PMI Council commissioned the Ethical Standards Review Committee (ESRC) to review ethical codes and develop the code review process.  The ESRC has developed processes that will facilitate active participation in the global project management community.  In 2005, the PMI Council approved the code review process, agreeing that global participation of the project management community is of paramount importance.  In 2005, the Council also instructed the ESRC to carry out the process approved by the Council and complete the revision of the code before the end of 2006.  This Code of Ethics and Professional Development was approved by the PMI Board of Directors in October 2006. <br><br>  <b>A.2 The process used to create this standard.</b> <br><br>  The first step taken by the Ethics Standards Development Committee [ESDC], to develop this Code, was to understand the ethical issues facing the project management community and to understand the values ‚Äã‚Äãand attitudes of practitioners from all regions of the globe.  This was achieved through various mechanisms, including focus group discussions and two Internet research including practitioners, members, volunteers, and people who are PMI certified.  In addition, the team analyzed the codes of ethics of 24 non-profit organizations from different regions of the world, explored best practices in the development of standards of ethics and explored ethics-related principles of a strategic plan in PMI. <br><br>  This extensive study by the ESDC provided the background for the development of a preliminary draft PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct.  The preliminary draft was distributed to the global project management community for comment.  Carefully, the standards development processes established by the American National Standards Institute were observed in the development of the Code because these processes were used for technical-level PMI projects and are considered to be the best recommendations for receiving and reviewing feedback from stakeholders on the impact on the project. <br><br>  The result of these efforts is the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, which not only describes the ethical values ‚Äã‚Äãsought by the global project management community, but also considers specific actions that are mandatory for each person associated with this Code.  A PMI violation of the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct may result in PMI sanctions as part of Case Procedures Ethics. <br><br>  ESDC has learned that as a project management practitioner, our society has its very serious commitment to ethics and we consider ourselves and our followers in the global project management community to be accountable to behave in accordance with the provisions of this Code. <br><br><h4>  APPENDIX B </h4><br><br>  <b>B.1 Glossary</b> <br><br>  <b>Offensively.</b>  Behavior that causes physical harm or creates a strong feeling of fear, humiliation, manipulation or exploitation of another person. <br><br>  <b>Conflict of interest.</b>  A situation that arises when a project management practitioner is faced with making a decision or performing some action that will benefit a practitioner or other person or organization with whom the practitioner is bound by the <u>obligation of loyalty</u> and at the same time harm another person or organization with whom the practice is related <u>commitment of loyalty</u> .  The only way practitioners can resolve a conflict of obligations is to reveal the conflict to the victims and allow them to decide how the practitioner should act. <br><br>  <b>Commitment of loyalty.</b>  Responsibility of a person, legal or moral, promoting the interests of the organization or another person with whom they are associated. <br><br>  <b>Project Management Institute [PMI].</b>  The entire Project Management Institute, including its committees, groups, and statutory components, such as departments, colleges, and specific interest groups. <br><br>  <b>PMI member.</b>  The person who joined the Project Management Institute as a member. <br><br>  <b>PMI-sponsored events.</b>  Activities that include, but are not limited to, participation in the PMI Member Advisory Group, the PMI standard development team, or other PMI working groups or committees.  It also includes the activities involved under the auspices of the statutory organization of PMI, whether it is a leading component or another type of educational activity or event. <br><br>  <b>Practice</b>  A person who performs an activity that contributes to the management of a project, portfolio or program within the framework of project management. <br><br>  <b>PMI is a volunteer.</b>  A person participating in <u>PMI-sponsored events</u> , whether a member of <u>the Project Management Institute</u> or not. <br><br>  <b>PS:</b> And here is the link <a href="http://www.pmi.org/About-Us/Ethics/~/media/PDF/Ethics/ap_pmicodeofethics.ashx">link</a> to the original. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/148246/">https://habr.com/ru/post/148246/</a></p>
