      Many friends ask me why I bought a mouse for $ 110 ... because it is no different from a mouse for $ 5-10.  On the one hand, yes, there is nothing to argue: there are 2 buttons, a wheel - there is, the cursor moves.  At this all similarity ends.  Before that, I had been visited by 3 rodents of the A4Tech company ala of the X7 game series: perhaps they are really the best in their price range, and it is unlikely that they will find a mouse with weights for 25 eternally green ones.  But do you need these weights?  I also tried nemerenoe amount of the rest of consumer goods, most of which are usually sold for shares in grocery supermarkets.  Well, not this. <br><br>  What made me buy this miracle?  But first, playing once again in CS 1.6, I already pressed the button, but the shot did not forgive, and they killed me.  But it's a shame, because I saw the first ‚Äúas BE‚Äù, took aim and fired ... I rummaged through the great Internet, and it turned out that this was not a marriage.  These are not the best quality components: not the best sensor, not the best buttons, not the best exchange frequency, not the best wire, and external external noise also helped, which in the end had such a depressing effect.  Only one way out - to buy a new, better rodent. <br><br>  I read a lot of times that there are no wireless gaming mice: they say, because of the lack of a wire, the response is too small, the interference is even greater and in general everything is bad.  But due to the fact that the wires accumulated on the table and so a lot, I wanted to somehow clear the working / game space.  I decided to risk it.  It turned out that there are wireless mice for players, although not many.  The next step was the presence of more than 8 buttons, as it is convenient for me when I don‚Äôt need to pull my hand off, to press the spacebar, enter, backspace, ecc, copy / paste, etc. And also in games like Diablo, Star Craft - there are not many buttons .  In general, the choice was among: Logitech G700, MadCatz RAT 9 and something from Razer.  But Logitech had the most buttons and batteries ‚Äî standard AA batteries, which made it possible to buy a few pieces and change them, if necessary, rather than recharge them through the wire that one wanted to get rid of. <br><br>  And, another important criterion was size.  I don‚Äôt like notebook laptops because a hand gets tired from a long game and fingers are erased on a rug, as they can hold up to 2 fingers. <br><br><h4>  Ergonomics </h4><br>  What can I say.  After the usual - it was quite unusual.  The hand goes almost completely, all the keys are pressed comfortably, easily, no need to reach anywhere, except for ‚ÄúG8‚Äù (the topmost one near the index finger). <br>  Because of the grip of the whole palm, I had to get used to the movement - it changed a little, I can not even describe how exactly - it just became different.  Got used to the week. <br>  The hardest thing was to get used to the fact that the sensor is not in the middle, but shifted to the place where the wire is usually.  Then another week went on addictive. <br>  As a result, even after 5-6 hour battles, the hand is absolutely not tired, which can not but rejoice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a72/18c/a5e/a7218ca5e9a99612884c5c5b67bce445.jpg" width="500"><br><h6>  View from above </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/671/dfa/3bb/671dfa3bbad9cdbac6bec868b17079c1.jpg" width="500"><br><h6>  Side view </h6><br><h4>  Two scroll wheel modes </h4><br>  Here it should be noted that the function is very convenient, especially when surfing the Internet, various documents in Microsoft Office and programming.  In one mode - there is a ratchet, like most mice.  In the second mode - it rotates freely by inertia.  If it is good to twist, then 20-30 seconds turns itself for sure.  Modes are switched by the first button above the wheel.  By the way, this is the only button that cannot be reprogrammed. <br><br><h4>  Materials and quality </h4><br>  Very reminiscent of "softtach" on the phones.  Pleasant to the touch, does not slip but not sandpaper.  Lyuftov, squeaks not observed.  Washes perfectly, calmly withstands rubbing with alcohol.  Practically does not get dirty, but in the middle of the four side keys dirt sometimes gathers, which is easily wiped off with a thin cloth.  Glossy bottom and a few sidewalls - naturally scratched, but this is hardly so important, because it is almost never visible. <br><br><h4>  Battery life </h4><br>  Only 1 AA element.  If good quality then it is 2500-3000 mAh.  I have enough for 6-7 days with 1-2 hours of games and 1-2 hours of surfing the Internet.  At the weekend I can play 4-5 hours a day for 3 days in a row for sure, and I will still have 2-5 hours of surfing. <br>  The above said works when setting up communication with a PC in the ‚Äúmedium‚Äù mode.  There are also ‚Äúgame‚Äù and ‚Äúeconomy‚Äù modes that I have never used.  These modes affect how quickly the mouse falls asleep.  The frequency of sharing with a PC is the maximum - 1000Hz. <br>  I have 7 batteries, charge them every 1-2 months. <br>  It is also possible to charge from a PC through the wire.  The wire is rather thick and difficult to play with, but possible.  I read on the forums that charging through the mouse is not very good, since there is a ‚Äúfast‚Äù charge, which negatively affects the batteries.  Yes, and it is not convenient.  It's easier to just change the battery.  You can also just take out the Akum, stick the wire and use it as a wired mouse.  By the way, it becomes decently easier. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/880/cdc/b93/880cdcb9326257b46ecc1354c306e121.jpg" width="500"><br><h6>  Belly </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e0d/a70/9d4/e0da709d45713e11956ce12b2d928aa7.jpg" width="500"><br><h6>  Opened belly: battery + space for Unify receiver </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a72/def/600/a72def6005a001c0c3bb07d18d1879dd.jpg" width="500"><br><h6>  Place under the wire </h6><br><h4>  13 buttons x 6 profiles </h4><br>  Actually, 13 is one that switches the wheel modes not counted. <br>  All others: G11 (at the crown of the head), left / right main, 4 at the side under the thumb, 3 to the left of the index finger and the wheel: press down, left, right.  And everything can be reprogrammed for any needs.  It is possible to set macros, keyboard shortcuts, specific functions, for example: viewing mail. <br><br>  Do not forget that if you have a little 13 buttons, or you work in several fundamentally different applications / games, then the manufacturer thought and equipped this gadget with built-in memory that can store 6 fully independent profiles, but since you need to use 1 more to switch profiles button, in the end we get 12x6 = 72 buttons on the mouse, which is very, very not bad. <br><br>  Profiles are created in the corresponding program from the official site.  By the way, the disc is not included, so you have to search and download yourself, which today is unlikely to cause any special problems, but still, some negative sediment remains ... <br><br>  On the side there are three LEDs that show the selected mode (in orange), as well as the battery charge (in green and red). <br><br><h4>  Sensor </h4><br>  5700 points.  Like me just mad stock.  It costs 1200, and in games I decrease the sensitivity even more - to about 800. <br>  You can put the dpi switch on the button, and the number of modes and the value for each mode are selected in increments of up to 1 dpi. <br><br>  About the sensor - I tried on all possible surfaces: colored, transparent, textured, wool, etc.  Everywhere works equally well.  No comments. <br><br><h4>  About problems </h4><br>  To be completely honest, the mouse is just over a year old.  None of the problems that I met on the forums and in the reviews did not come across.  I use it quite carefully: it does not fall, at least once a week dust is wiped off, and once a month it is vacuumed. <br><br><h4>  Impressions </h4><br>  Not a bit sorry that he bought it.  There are no more delays in games, responsiveness is all 101%.  True, I use only 1 profile, since I no longer need it.  Ease of use and quality - at a height that you would expect when using peripherals from Logitech.  Recommend. <br><br>  At the moment, it is this model that has already been discontinued, and the replacement has been the updated Logitech G700s, in which a nice picture appeared and increased to 8200 dpi, the price has become even higher.  The remaining characteristics are identical. <br><br><h4>  P.S. </h4><br>  I apologize for not very successful hubs, as soon as the opportunity arises - I will transfer it to more appropriate ones.  Hope for understanding. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/216199/">https://habr.com/ru/post/216199/</a></p>
