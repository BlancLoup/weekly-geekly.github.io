It happened the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/287576/">last time</a> .  Someone thinks that correctors are useless, someone thinks that it is better ‚Äúto go to the gym‚Äù, someone believes that the use of such devices is not as safe for health as everyone tries to convince. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d4b/91c/294/d4b91c294f754b0c87f43a631b07d39f.png"></div><br>  Let's tell what we know. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  A flat back is not equal to a healthy back. </h3><br>  The first thing we always warn about is that you need to be able to separate the two concepts.  By a healthy spine, in simple words, we understand its development without pathologies.  A flat back is a concept from the field of aesthetics. <br><br>  Posture Correctors - partially work in this plane.  A single-word word such as ‚Äúsan‚Äù, ‚Äúto be in front of yourself‚Äù should not lose these meanings.  Indeed, part of the marketing of proofreading manufacturers is aimed at convincing users of the ‚Äústraight back‚Äù emotional component: they say, friends and colleagues will see you differently, and you yourself will feel more confident.  Think it's funny?  Not at all: there are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3917889/">studies</a> on how poses affect motivation and emotions.

      It is impossible to deny that posture problems, which can be seen even with the naked eye, are associated with discomfort and back pain.  In <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3356261/">some materials,</a> such facts are described as almost another ‚ÄúPlague‚Äù of the 21st century, which has already overwhelmed over 70% of the population. <br><br>  In this sense, correctors become the prevention and prevention of undesirable consequences, such as chronic pain, which provoke many people to seriously change their lives, their work, to give up their hobbies.  And again <br><br><h3>  Are posture correctors related to health in this case? </h3><br>  Yes, but <b>not only</b> in the direct corrector - backbone paradigm.  It is not by chance that concepts of proofreaders appear with a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/junhao/darma-sit-smart-for-a-healthy-body-and-mind/description">heart rate monitor and breath tracking</a> .  Indeed, there is some <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11145359">evidence</a> that sitting evenly, for example, in the workplace, breathing returns to normal, which affects the heart rate, a person does not experience stress, less headaches, etc. With the help of correctors, this becomes controllable! <br><br>  Well, then you can already argue: less stress, smoother breathing?  Less risk of cardiovascular diseases, stroke, etc. <br><br>  Some studies confirm a direct link between a sedentary lifestyle, sedentary and various kinds of exacerbations not directly related to the spine, in other words, not hernias, etc. In one of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5073551/">these studies</a> on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, even the corrector appears as a tool. Lumo Lift, as one of its functions including activity tracker! <br><br>  An early company device, Lumo Back, also participated in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4909392/">one</a> of the studies on the sedentary lifestyle of office workers. <br><br>  This can be used as proof that the correctors are related to medicine.  They are looking for use and, in general, are. <br><br><h3>  Proof and back </h3><br>  It is fair to reproach that most electronic correctors, about which we usually write, are not related to the entire back entirely: indeed, the same scoliosis is distinguished by the divisions of the back. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fe0/c9b/4de/fe0c9b4de7b249968680b723a9e2ff38.jpg"><br><br>  Most of the proofreaders are mounted in the thoracic region.  However, straightening your back in a ‚Äúline‚Äù, you somehow activate the whole mechanism, and this is also true. <br><br><ul><li>  What can not make corrector </li></ul><br>  Corrector can not cure.  This is something like "dietary supplement."  If a person has any pathology, then in general to use any means, be it a corrector, a corset, a bandage without a doctor, is not very reasonable.  Independently "rebuilt" posture can only harm. <br><br>  Otherwise, when the treatment method is chosen, no one will deny one of the correctors as an additional tool for self-control. <br><br><ul><li>  What can the corrector </li></ul><br>  What-no, but still training the muscle corset.  Unlike supporting devices with a corrector, your muscles do not stop working: you straighten yourself, you return to the posture fixed earlier. <br><br>  The corrector can act as a means of reducing back pain when you find a comfortable posture, and it can be really hard to remember, a sensitive corrector will help you return to it.  This is a temporary measure of disguise, but it works.  Next - the doctor.  In recent years, or for decades, a new discipline has emerged - <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15844769">postorology</a> , which studies the connection between posture and pathologies of the back, including chronic pain. <br><br>  Proofreader is a trainer.  If you do not feel something suspicious, but you want to work out a certain posture, posture yourself, then with the proofreader - yes, it is possible. <br><br><h3>  Gym - replacing all these proofreaders </h3><br>  To begin with, the treatment of spinal curvatures can be carried out by conservative and operative methods.  We usually put a knife under the knife rarely, for example, if the curvature is already about 60 degrees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/701/cde/854/701cde854cf44978978dc8e63cf183db.jpg"><br><br>  Basically - sent to neurology and there, yes, there is also a gym.  Physical therapy classes are held under a certain scenario, and they are quite sparing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e4f/61f/fd3/e4f61ffd38b14b8692288de1f7e1b7bf.gif"><br><br>  So, those who recommended strengthening with the help of a bar should clarify that it is advisable to go to the doctor on an MRI in front of the hall, because otherwise, unknowingly, you can ruin yourself great. <br><br>  It would seem that stretching and visation are the most common methods of prophylaxis that can be done - <a href="http://osteohondrosy.net/zanyatiya-na-turnike-pri-osteokhondroze-vybiraem-nagruzku.html">not even everyone is</a> shown at home on the door jamb!  They can lead to overstretching of the joints and articular tissue, so that the piece is also individual. <br><br>  For those who have one answer: go to the pool, it should be recalled that in domestic practice, the pool for progressive forms of scoliosis is <a href="http://spina-sustav.ru/pozvonochnik/skolioz/plavanie-protiv-skolioza-osobennosti-metoda.html">also not</a> prescribed <a href="http://spina-sustav.ru/pozvonochnik/skolioz/plavanie-protiv-skolioza-osobennosti-metoda.html">for everyone</a> , individually. <br><br>  Again, returning to the gym and bar, you need to remember about the bandage.  And also to remember that if it does not hurt - this does not mean that there is nothing.  There are cases when a hernia does not bother a person for a long time, and it ‚Äústrengthens‚Äù the spine with a rod until it leaves the hall with a cane. <br><br>  The most harmless means of prevention is to choose moderate choreopathy, as well as Pilates.  However, its effectiveness is still being proven, given that the author of this trend <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3445206/">is still self-taught</a> . <br><br><h3>  Do I need a proofreader? </h3><br>  The seller‚Äôs natural desire is to sell, but we never imposed anything.  On Geektimes there is a review of Lumo Lift imported by us, there is a story about how it is and why it could be used in practice, but we <b>always</b> put it in equal conditions with other products and developments. <br><br>  Therefore, if I say that a corrector is needed, then this is also an abstract corrector.  It can be used, taking into account its aesthetic characteristics, and as a prevention of curvature, honestly considering the way of life. <br><br>  If you understand that the work is predominantly sedentary, there are no physical loads, there is no time for sport, then sooner or later, it is imperceptible, but the muscle tone will decrease.  Proofreader as a reminder - why not ?!  But, once again: do not harbor illusions, and if your back hurts, then neither the corrector, nor the dog's coat belt, nor the horizontal bar ... It is better to see a doctor. <br><br>  However, here I should make a remark so that you understand what we mean by corrector.  In our understanding, this is a mechanical or electronic device that does not perform independent supporting functions and is not an ‚Äúalternative‚Äù to your muscles.  Proofreaders remind that when it is time to straighten a little, return to the desired posture by the means that are available to them: vibration / sound.  And it will be Lumo, "Master of Posture" or something from <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/263356/">this collection</a> - this is your personal choice. <br><br>  Want another example?  We believe that we ourselves can cope and remember when and how to keep your back.  This is logical when it comes to the same office: it is easy for an adult to control himself.  But there are episodes of our life when we do not attach importance to how and what we do.  For example, you need to bend down and pick something up: it would seem an instantaneous action, and no one will give it any serious meaning.  And yet: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f4/998/e63/6f4998e6368647fe959ff78157c386bf.jpg"><br><br>  In the case of the back, however, the score goes on for seconds.  One wrong move - and: hello, hernia! <br><br><h3>  Proofreaders in Russia </h3><br>  Two electronic auxiliary devices are known in Russia: the ‚Äú <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/master-osanki-dlja-detej-i-vzroslyh.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dspina%26utm_campaign%3Dmeister">Master of Posture</a> ‚Äù and ‚Äú <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/lumo-lift-ustrojstvo-korrektirujuschee-osanku.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dspina%26utm_campaign%3Dlumo">Lumo Lift</a> ‚Äù.  The latter is more by our efforts. <br><br>  Also recently, we wrote a short review about the Oskor sound proofreader and mentioned a recent project with the Asana Boomstarter.  It is worth adding that on requests "Posture Corrector" you in the search will drop out supporting corsets. <br><br>  The use of such systematically is an extremely dangerous thing, since it leads to muscle atrophy, so without consultation with a specialist, use support devices with caution. <br><br>  Well, and what we highly recommend is not the ‚Äúbutterfly‚Äù correctors.  If in the case of bandages there is some kind of orthopedic history, then the butterflies are a dull force: they tightened more tightly, looked like an even one, and then formed in half. <br><br>  Take care of yourself! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370361/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370361/</a></p>
