      - firstly, they take too much time, and secondly, they make the client feel like a student of the ‚ÄúPC for beginners‚Äù courses.  Sometimes it happens that this is not a fool client, and the site is simply inconvenient. <br><br>  Today, shops and companies need to process more applications and sell more additional goods and services with high margins that bring the main profit (bracket to the TV, cover to the SLR, excursion to the load to the tour, etc.). <br><br>  We did a handy thing, with which the manager can quickly display the pages you need on the client‚Äôs screen (and vice versa).  But first, why do customers in Russia call by phone, even if they can conveniently order through the site?  Some obvious reasons you know.  Add a couple less obvious, but also important. <br><br><h2>  <font color="5194c2">Stirlitz in touch</font> </h2><br>  So why do customers call? <br><br><ol><li>  The accounting system is not associated with the content management system.  We all know the classic situation ‚ÄúThere is a product on the site, we are calling - there is no product‚Äù.  For the assortment to be updated in real time, and not after the content manager manually updates the catalog, you need to link, for example, 1C and Bitrix (or another site engine). </li><li>  The site is not as convenient as you think.  It is easier for a person to call than to dig.  Put <a href="https://metrika.yandex.ru/promo/webvisor/">WebVizor</a> and watch videos. </li><li>  Conversation is safer.  What if the information on the site is outdated?  (Now we are not talking about the catalog, but about other service pages.) Are there any living people behind this ‚Äúfacade‚Äù?  Who are they and how do they treat customer service?  The site can be all beautifully described, and the manager will take the tube. </li><li>  Talk faster.  Not so long ago, a good study was conducted when a person who wanted to buy a car left a request on the websites of two dozen car dealers.  Some managers sent a letter "I am not in the office now, call back later."  Some responded only after hundreds of hours.  And this is against the background of the sinking of the automotive market in a crisis.  The buyer, by the way, was quite targeted and, as a result, bought Toyota. </li><li>  I want to talk.  Sometimes it's nice to torture someone for your money. </li></ol><br>  In different subjects the percentage of telephone orders ranges from 30 to 60%.  In this case, their cost is higher than the cost of the order from the site.  You need to either spend your time talking, or educate and feed the operators, or lay down a monthly budget for a ‚Äúremote‚Äù call center, prescribe instructions and worry that these outsiders have a little souliness about your business. <br>  Of course, when selling expensive, complex or additional services without a phone, nowhere.  But I really want to, if not completely get rid of it, then at least somehow optimize this process. <br><br><h2>  <font color="5194c2">What solution do we offer</font> </h2><br>  If the visitor needs assistance in finding a product or service, the operator can demonstrate them directly on the client‚Äôs monitor using the <a href="http://www.krible.com/">Teleportor</a> .  It is enough to inform the operator of the code indicated on the page. <br><br> <a href="http://www.krible.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae6/866/ad9/ae6866ad95764de19682418b874621a4.png"></a> <br><br>  It looks like the TeamViewer remote computer management system, only there is no need to install software.  It is safe - the user's browser cannot be controlled unless it has enabled the service. <br><br>  Service can: <br><br><ul><li>  show the page the operator is looking at </li><li>  show the page the client is looking at </li><li>  move the visitor to the selected part of the page </li><li>  you can select the text and it will be allocated to the client </li></ul><br>  The visitor cannot be transferred to another site: you can move only within the domain name for which the Teleportator code is set.  So we excluded the possibility of intercepting visitors by sorting codes and redirecting to competitors' sites. <br><br><h2>  <font color="5194c2">Read more about the process</font> </h2><br>  During a telephone conversation, an employee of the company asks the site visitor to click on the Teleportor button and dictate a four-digit access code. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/006/435/238/00643523865347d98b529cf4d269686c.png"><br>  <i>How it works on the site Enter</i> <br><br>  The operator translates the dictated code into the control panel. <br><br>  Everything, now the Krible server connected two sessions in the general connection.  The operator can request the address of the page that the client is currently viewing.  One click - and the Teleportor transmits the URL from the client to the operator (makes a redirect in the operator's browser). <br><br>  Now the operator sees the same page as the client.  The dialogue is becoming more substantive. <br><br>  And vice versa - the operator can show the necessary pages on the client‚Äôs screen. <br>  One click, the URL is transferred in the other direction. <br><br>  The operator can highlight the selected text with a marker.  To do this, select a section of text with the mouse and click on the "Send" button.  The service will display the desired page on the client‚Äôs screen, scroll to the required site and tint the selected text.  It is very convenient to discuss the points of the contract or the pepper bulk price list. <br><br>  This method of communication transmits a minimum of data, provides full cross-platform compatibility, does not require the installation of additional plug-ins and libraries. <br><br><h2>  <font color="5194c2">How else can a teleporter be used?</font> </h2><br>  We noticed that some businesses that want to get a client offer him a personalized discount. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/154/6f1/52d/1546f152d9b8469b81573fbbcc6fe874.png"><br><br>  "This is your personal code to receive a 20% discount on the first order" <br><br>  With the help of the Teleportator you can do the same thing, it is enough to change the texts (this is configured in the personal account). <br><br>  The result is not only a discount system, but also an analytical tracker.  In your account you can see all the events on call of the Teleportator, and in the event itself there is a lot of information on the client - geo-targeting, where it came from, etc. <br><br><h2>  <font color="5194c2">For whom we did the service?</font> </h2><br>  First of all, for online stores and for those who sell tours, you can conveniently and quickly display hotels. <br><br>  But the Teleportator can be put on any site - it does not ask for a place, and it will be more pleasant for customers that they are well served. <br><br><h2>  <font color="5194c2">Technical part</font> </h2><br>  Since the release of the first version (it was 3 years ago) Teleportator, running Node.js.  Socket.IO is used as a message transport.  I never regretted that they used this technical solution.  We also support a small pool of virtual locks that perfectly withstand the spontaneous influx of visitors on ‚Äúblack Fridays‚Äù and holiday days. <br><br><h2>  <font color="5194c2">Similar solutions</font> </h2><br>  There is, of course.  Here, for example, the solution of the company 3LiveShop, interesting, but slightly futurological. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/oR3YOqOX4RM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg8fIdEDhaQasyGpKEz8FZxUrU5XQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  They write about the analogy with the scene in the ‚ÄúSpecial Opinion‚Äù, where the character Tom Cruise controls the interactive screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb5/b83/f35/eb5b83f358454e05b22a15a4f04c1a7d.jpg"><br><br>  And, of course, there you need to buy additional equipment.  We are all a little easier. <br><br><h2>  <font color="5194c2">What do you think about our service?</font> </h2><br>  We would be grateful for the feedback.  As usual with our products, you can take a <a href="http://www.krible.com/">free test for 14 days</a> . <br><br>  And we also remembered a good joke about additional sales.  True, in it a jeep is selling into the load to the fishing hook, and not vice versa, but the essence - the efficient manager identifies the client's needs and earns additional money to the store - transferred perfectly: <br><blockquote>  A young man from the province got a job as a salesman.  At the end of the day, a manager approached him and asked: <br>  ‚ÄúWell, and how many people did you shop today?‚Äù <br>  - One. <br>  - One?  In our shopping center sellers, on average, serve from 20 to 30 purchases per day!  Yeah!  And what is the amount left in our center by the customer you have served? <br>  - 102,516 dollars 17 cents. <br>  - What about?  102 thousand 516 dollars and 17 cents ?!  What did you sell him? <br>  - At first I sold him a small fishing hook, then a medium one and after that the largest one.  Then I sold him the most fashionable fishing rod.  When he was packed these purchases, I asked where he was going to fish?  He replied that in the Gulf of Mexico.  To this I told him that there could not do without a boat.  We went down to the boat department and I advised him to buy a twin-engine diesel boat.  He liked it, but he doubted that his sports car would be able to tow such a boat.  We went to the car department, and then I advised him a jeep with a trailer.  These are the purchases made today by my first client. <br><br>  A square-eyed manager followed the story of his new seller: <br>  - You want to say that this buyer came to buy a fishing hook, and in the end bought a boat and a jeep with a trailer? <br>  - No no.  He came to buy a pack of tampons for his wife.  And I told him that since the weekend did not succeed, you can go fishing! </blockquote><br> <a href="http://krible.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8fb/895/aea/8fb895aeae8c4bed90a6c113e778b75e.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291336/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291336/</a></p>
