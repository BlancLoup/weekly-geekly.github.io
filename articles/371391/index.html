      Ahead of waiting for repairs, in which I also stood side by side. <br><br>  Part one.  Mortgage registration. <br>  Part two.  Select an object. <br>  Part Three  What's in the car - the seat and steering wheel.  What is "apartment without finishing". <br>  Part Four  And finished wall, it seems. <br>  Part Five.  And we have plumbing, here. <br>  Part six.  Hail the Omnissiah!  or about electricity. <br>  Part Seven.  About smart home. <br><br><h4>  Part one.  Mortgage registration </h4><br>  Now the mortgage is BYE that is regulated by 214- ( <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_51038/">Federal Law "On participation in the shared construction of apartment buildings and other real estate objects and on introducing amendments to some legislative acts of the Russian Federation" dated December 30, 2004 N 214-</a> ). <br><br>  Since the summer of 2018, the situation will change, here's a <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/realty/articles/2017/10/23/738917-zakon-dolevom-stroitelstve">link</a> for you to read, and another <a href="https://rosreestr.ru/site/fiz/zaregistrirovat-nedvizhimoe-imushchestvo-/predstavlenie-dokumentov-na-gosudarstvennuyu-registraciyu-prav/">link.</a> <br><br>  They dragged me to plan a mortgage in a famous bank.  What I have to say is that the bank itself does not issue mortgages, but collects the documents and sends them to the banks "further."  Great idea.  The implementation is simply none.  Closer to disgusting.  As a result, nothing happened through them, why so - it will be lower. <br><br>  How did I get to such a life (or rather, not me, but it is easier to write in the first person, because I think to do exactly the same if I have to). <br><br>  Everything was very simple.  There was money on hand ‚Äúabout the first 10% installment of a house from an old Indian cemetery‚Äù, on the way to visit a poster came across ‚Äúbuy from us without a sms at high speed‚Äù, the owner of rental housing said that everything becomes more expensive, so with you dear friend - N more money. <br><br>  I had to study the market and rental housing (which reported that the owner had lost a bit in prices), and the mortgage market had long been going to see what and how. <br><br>  What was needed.  It was necessary to either a finished object, or an object in a high (guaranteed delivery in less than a year) degree of readiness. <br><br>  The reasons for the short deadlines are simple and clear: <br><br><ul><li>  Stuck into the ranks of cheerful shareholders, as on a huge number of objects, did not want to completely. </li><li>  Moving to Moscow costs, conditionally, +1 rental price - 50-100% of the monthly amount is given to the "agent", plus the price of the move, plus the so-called pledge every time is muddy, so you need to move either immediately, or in some understandable The time period for the ratio of the price of moving to the price of overpayment was understandable </li></ul><br>  A simple example: a move costs 40 thousand rubles, an overpayment (an increase in rent) by 4 thousand - will pay off in less than a year (if you move into an apartment with a rental price ‚Äúbefore the price rises,‚Äù at the same time closer to work). <br><br>  What turned out. <br><br>  It turned out that the house from the point of view of builders is in the states: <br><br><ul><li>  clean field and can fence and pit </li><li>  foundation pit and walls </li><li>  everything is ready, but not handed over (but the keys can already be issued - the object is built and running) </li><li>  everything is ready and handed over and registered in the rosreestre (here I am not sure, by the way - from what stage the Rosreestr gives something) </li><li>  everything is ready and handed over and put on the cadastral registration, the house itself, and the apartments in it, and even the booth of the stray dog ‚Äã‚Äãcalled Shavermyash. </li></ul><br>  From the point of view of the bank, the first and second are mortgages, the fifth is the secondary market, and the third and fourth are some kind of incomprehensible thing about which bank employees themselves are not very much in the subject. <br><br>  As a result, I initially applied for the secondary market, and strongly regretted: <br><br><ul><li>  The database of the bank itself is a little more than just a whole, starting with the fact that there can be one set of identical (!!) photos for two objects. </li><li>  In general, the selection of housing is given to outsourcing in some ... well, not horns and hooves, probably - but if I have been called for all the time only 1.5 of the complex, the advertisement of which is hung all over Moscow, from the subway to the billboards - not, well, guys, I myself I can choose. </li><li>  The legal office chosen by the bank is distinguished by similar conditions - it costs a lot, for which it is not clear, the contract provides for the evaluation of a single object, and the reviews about this company differ ... well, not at all good. </li></ul><br>  So I lost the first month. <br><br><h4>  The sudden </h4><br>  Help 2-NDFL and discharge from labor, it turns out, are valid for a month.  I did not have time to reach the stage of signing the contract in a month - start getting a certified copy of the labor first, with the signatures and then all this.  Not all firms have this quick procedure (it took up to a week at my previous place of work). <br><br><h4>  Amazing </h4><br>  The most fun banks were VTB (one of them) and AHML. <br><br>  The first demanded an agreement for a discount with some Moscow Lights.  Or not lights.  The cost of discounts for the first estimates was approximately equal to the cost of services of these lights.  AIZHK asked for a statement of salary card transactions for the year.  Well, I sent them about 50 pages of scans.  Mortgage AHML endorsed by the way. <br><br><h4>  Prices </h4><br>  Price per square meter is directly proportional to proximity to the metro and proximity to the Moscow Ring Road. <br>  The minimum price tag in the suburbs starts anywhere from 60 thousand rubles per square or 2.5 million for 40 square meters. <br><br>  In Moscow, the price tag starts from about 160-180 thousand rubles for the same square, or from 7 million for an apartment. <br><br>  The reasons for this difference <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/">can be discussed on the website about politics</a> .  You can not discuss. <br><br>  Oh yes.  Where ends.  I saw a house in Moscow, where the price per square meter (one meter) is a million rubles, and this is not the limit, there are more expensive houses.  The house was sold out at the ‚Äúthere is not even a fence‚Äù stage yet. <br><br><h4>  Final choice </h4><br>  In the second month of waiting, I myself don‚Äôt know what, I myself chose ‚Äúwhat I want‚Äù, but already in the primary market, and sent a request to transfer the mortgage from the primary to the secondary market, where this application safely hung.  She hung up for the reason that for of those banks that were on the object: <br><br><ul><li>  with one there was no contract on the primary market, </li><li>  I had to send an application for review with others - I sent it, but she got lost somewhere, </li><li>  and still others simply did not work with this object. </li></ul><br>  I had to say ‚Äúgoodbye‚Äù to bank number one, and go to the bank that was at the facility (there were a dozen there), where I was approved for a mortgage, although both references, of course, had to be asked again at work. <br><br>  3-4 days after entering another bank, they called me from the first bank, and finally explained that there was such a trouble, there it was, but these somehow were not that good.  So the idea with the intermediary bank was good, but the implementation of course disappoint. <br><br><h4>  Part two.  Object selection </h4><br>  Honestly, I expected the bank to somehow draw its beautiful interface for selecting objects, with construction sites, subways and so on.  AND THERE IS NO. <br><br>  Still taxis, pedal and bibikat Cyan, and SUDDENLY Yandex maps help a lot - you enter something like ‚Äúresidential complex‚Äù in your search - and it shows everything directly on the map. <br>  Then it remains only to open Excel (from office 365 of course), and make there a sign of the object / builder type / deadline / actual deadline / price / car availability / metro accessibility / railway accessibility / distance to the nearest garbage can. <br><br>  <b>Evaluation of the developer</b> <br><br>  It turned out that there is a table on the Internet from Rosstroy, about developers, with an indication of the volume of construction - so the question ‚Äúwhether the developer would die‚Äù was not so complicated. <br>  In fact, of course, nothing can be predicted - all that remains is to hope and believe. <br><br>  After the compilation of the table - 2/3 of the objects fell out of sight, primarily due to transport accessibility.  Well, it is not interesting for me to look at the places where only wolves * used to go, and now there is a primer that you can use to get to something loaded both during the day and at night, and at the other end of the Moscow Ring Road.  Or with the state of the form ‚Äúthere is a minibus to the railway, and the subway will never be.  And there is a great view of the garbage. " <br><br>  During the discussion of this moment, buddies of friends with the Tricky Plan surfaced. <br><br>  The cunning Plan was like this - to take an apartment in a new building and rent it at the price ‚Äúa bit cheaper than in Moscow‚Äù, and thus pay for the mortgage.  The cunning Plan did not work because of the disgusting transport accessibility of the new building, and no ‚Äúright next to the forest and the environment and the ceiling 10 cm above‚Äù did not fix this.  And yes, according to unconfirmed rumors, the first year in the new building can not live - around repairs, dust, perforators, wall chasers and all that.  Sometimes you can not second. <br><br><h4>  Empty developer sites </h4><br>  Often, one can understand that how much ‚Äúin fact‚Äù is possible only during a personal visit, and sometimes you have to go to the site, and sometimes to the central office.  It is better to go there and there.  Moreover, the whole of Moscow can be all hung with advertising, but in fact - everything can be very different.  Including at the prices. <br><br>  Starting from the classics of the genre - the price per square is indicated for an apartment the size of a stadium, subject to payment by cash (strictly cash, hehe), 100% at the campaign office, and if you buy three days after the approval of the advertisement.  The price for an ‚Äúapartment from‚Äù will begin for an object at the stage if not the fence around the future excavation, then so, without finishing (also a separate topic), on the first floor and the minimum area. <br><br>  But these are still cute pranks. <br><br>  As a result, by the end of the second month from the decision to ‚Äústart‚Äù - the object was selected, everything was signed at the bank, everything was signed at the construction company, the only thing left was to register the contract in the cadastre and cartography register. <br><br>  The process takes from 2 to 4 weeks, an average of three.  Performed by the developer, in my case.  Although, according to the experience of colleagues, the procedure for individuals is simple - it is necessary to submit an application for registration through state services, arrive at a chosen time and submit everything.  Everything is a thick package of references and documents.  Then get all the same, but stitched and under the seals. <br><br><h4>  Hidden payments </h4><br>  Everything costs money, and all the more in a falling market. <br><br>  As a result, in addition to the mortgage, the bank still unobtrusively offers life insurance.  More precisely as unobtrusively.  Life insurance costs 1-2% of the cost of a loan; without insurance, the cost of a loan grows by 1-2%.  An excellent choice, as sheriff Rottingham said. <br><br>  In addition, the notary will have to pay for the power of attorney to be submitted by the developer to cartography, but there are a few - three thousand rubles, and sometimes you have to pay the construction company separately for something else (the acute reluctance of some people to pay for something else - caused the future purchase and re-election of the object, even before the visit to the second bank). <br><br>  I would say, from experience, that for me it would be more correct, in time, to be an independent choice of an object, before a visit to the bank, and even before the choice of a bank. <br><br>  That is, they first selected the object, then came there ‚Äúto see‚Äù, then to the central office (or to the sales department at the facility) ‚Äúto talk‚Äù, and only then choose a bank. <br><br><h4>  Part Three  What's in the car - the seat and steering wheel.  What is "apartment without finishing" </h4><br>  I have already been to the facility, I looked at the photos on the Internet, I had seen similar things with my friends before. <br>  An apartment without finishing is four walls of aerated concrete without plaster, floor, ceiling, window (with the cheapest single-chamber double-glazed window), a door (the simplest, well at least not a screen). <br><br><ul><li>  Input electricians (temporary shield on 2 automatic C16). </li><li>  Water intake (two pipes, hot-cold). </li><li>  Water input for towel warmer. </li><li>  Counters. </li><li>  Water outlet (riser), and a radiator. </li><li>  Everything. </li></ul><br>  There are no inter-wall partitions.  Screed no.  In the toilet-water part of the waterproofing is - already under the screed, it is not clear what.  The walls of the toilet-water block of tongue-and-groove slabs are such a drywall, only 2 times thicker.  There is a pipeline on the floor to the batteries, and it still needs to be removed under the screed. <br><br>  So everything will have to be done from scratch, and from this state to the ‚Äúsmart home‚Äù, oh, how far. <br><br><h4>  What to check when accepting from the developer </h4><br>  In the case of "without finishing" - there is almost nothing to check.  The walls should be plastered, the windows in the future should still be changed, as the doors.  The main thing that the batteries did not flow, the area and the location of the apartment corresponded to the one chosen and written, the ventilation was ventilated, the water did not stand in the basement and did not leak from the roof (if the uppermost floor). <br><br>  If the apartment is finished, then wooooh ... from waterproofing and matching machines - cables. <br><br><h4>  Part Four  And cum wall, it seems </h4><br>  You will have to start with a simple one - floor, ceiling, walls, plumbing, sewage. <br><br>  In this part, I had to ask the advice of senior comrades (who had recently made repairs), the advice of comrades from the construction site and many other tips.  The main advice - do not try to combine mortgage and tractor construction, nothing good will come of it. <br><br>  <b>Let's start with the walls</b> <br><br>  The main purpose of the walls in a smart home is to conduct wires with electricity to the outlets.  There are three methods of conducting electrics - in the corrugation and on the floor under the screed, in the corrugation and in the grooves on the wall, and in the cable channel along the wall.  As an additional option, there is "in the corrugation of drywall." <br>  The choice of "where to pull" - I made in the direction of the pens.  This is the easiest. <br><br>  The questions ‚Äúwhether to make the junction box and which wires to take‚Äù are given below in the text. <br>  The work is dusty, you need a wall chaser, it is done before any screeds, installation of ceilings and so on. <br><br>  <b>Wall plaster</b> <br><br>  You can plaster manually, you can mechanically, you can close the drywall.  Colleagues did this and that. <br><br>  The main choice is what kind of plaster (simple or improved), for painting or wallpaper, and with what quality. <br><br>  <b>Floor</b> <br><br>  In the Soviet (means better) time, the floor was almost everywhere done the same way - wooden transverse boards (lags) were laid on the floor, expanded clay was put in between lags, boards again on top, sometimes parquet on boards, sometimes chipboard / fiberboard, sometimes nothing, on top of the carpet . <br>  Now the floors are made of either sand-polymer mixture, or, alternatively, floors with a dry or semi-dry screed.  What is better - I do not know yet.  Many people praised the dry screed Knauf. <br><br>  Issue price - from 1000..1500r / m2. <br><br>  Half the price is the price of the ballast material, it needs a lot - the thickness of the screed starts from 4-5 mm, because it is necessary to close all protruding irregularities, pipes, and ground wires (for example, ground drainage to the bathroom). <br><br>  Do this work yourself - the big question, I did not. <br><br>  <b>Ceiling</b> <br><br>  Again, you can whiten, paint, you can make tension and in general any.  The only BUT - it is impossible to make a ceiling at all, and if in Soviet times it was possible to tighten the power of the chandelier through hollow floor slabs, then in a monolithic house it would not be possible to do so. <br><br>  <b>Room dividers</b> <br><br>  There is no special alternative to bricks, if you plan to hang something on the walls.  Aeroduct except that.  By the way, the walls in the toilet-bathroom are also relevant; tongue-and-groove plates do not hold the load. <br><br><h4>  Part Five.  And we have plumbing, here </h4><br>  A modern water supply system requires a separate post; maybe I will write sometime. <br>  Here the technology from the time of the USSR went ahead.  There is a classic steel pipe, there are polyethylene and polypropylene pipes, there are metal-plastic pipes and some kind of Rehau hybrid - polyethylene reinforced with a frame.  You can take copper pipes in general, there is one. <br><br>  <b>Water pipe protection</b> <br><br>  The choice of automatic protection against leakage - <a href="http://ammo1.livejournal.com/81259.html">link once</a> , <a href="http://gnawer.livejournal.com/139029.html">link two</a> , link <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/boxowerview/blog/173007/">three</a> (although on the site about the policy, please excuse me). <br><br>  Interestingly, for 7 years, since 2011, nothing has changed in these systems, at least I don‚Äôt see a subscription to send a notification to the ‚Äúdisarranged‚Äù telegrams.  The NAG has an SNR-ERD-GSM-1.1 system with dry contacts and GSM, but there has also recently been no telegram / watsup. <br><br>  <b>The modern scheme of water supply protection includes (in order)</b> <br><br>  - Crane (valve) mechanical introductory <br>  - Aquastoroz / Neptune / Other Cranes from Israel <br>  - Pressure Reducer <br>  - Main pre-filter (prefilter) <br>  - Counter <br>  - Main fine filter <br><br>  I‚Äôm sure about this particular order, in particular, the counter can be supplied even before the pressure reducer, and then no Neptune will save, if the counter is broken. <br><br><h4>  Part six.  Hail the Omnissiah!  or about electricity </h4><br>  Modern electrical equipment for the home requires a separate article. <br><br>  Similarly, a lot has changed since Soviet times, in particular, instead of 16A automatic traffic jams, differential automata are being installed.  You can, of course, be limited only to the RCD and only to the bathroom and the outlet for the washing machine. <br><br>  In the Russian Federation, the choice of firms is not so broad - ABB, Legrand, Hager, IEC. <br><br>  The main thing is not to be mistaken with the choice for home <br><br>  - leakage: type A <br>  - on the response curve: B (although C is commonly set). <br><br>  The prices, of course, are seriously different - the difbautoma ABB B16 30ma / A costs 6,500 rubles, and the difektomat IEK 2p 16A / 30mA C AVDT 32 is 850 rubles. The difference in price is almost 10 times. <br><br>  The input of electricity, except for difavtomatov, put an input voltage relay, more precisely a protective relay - Fire protection device against arc breakdown with the function of protection against voltage surges - MEANDR UZM-50MD or UZM-51MD - standard UHL4 version (difference with UHL2 in operating temperature). <br><br>  The wires have also changed - instead of the best old aluminum cable in the world, it has become possible to buy copper WWGNG and even VVGNG-LS, and even do without adhesions and twists.
