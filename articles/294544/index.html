The authors of the widgets promise to turn a random visitor into a buyer and, as statistics show, personal contact increases the number of sales several times. <br><br>  We decided to understand the differences between the popular callback-services, because we offer our clients a full range of services for the development and promotion of landing pages - it is important for us to understand the specifics of the services in order to effectively use the advantages and avoid disadvantages in the context of specific projects. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b><a href="http://redconnect.ru/">RedConnect</a></b>

      A distinctive feature of RedConnect is the ability to order a call back without a pop-up window. <br><br>  In general, RedConnect implemented <b>three different forms of ordering a callback</b> : <br>  ‚Ä¢ a <b>plate</b> placed above the site content in the lower right corner, in which a phone number is entered; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>button to open the input form</b> , is installed in any place of the site.  Here there is a choice of shape and color; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>pop-up</b> , disabled by default.  It can be activated by setting two parameters: the label and the speed of issue. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/587/093/5fe/5870935fe6846daa6a2e0d812b8d4da7.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>The main advantages of RedConnect:</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ The call is considered to be held only 10 seconds after the answer of the operator; <br>  ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúProtection against a fool‚Äù: screening of numbers like +799922222222; <br>  ‚Ä¢ The ability to distribute calls along the lines, which reflect the company's hierarchy; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Good test period conditions: 30 minutes for an unlimited period; <br>  ‚Ä¢ The main advantage of the service is the application with its own browser. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/c72/aec/e66/c72aece66f36026a58dc291103464933.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Thanks to the browser, the operator can see all the actions of the user and assist him by transferring to the necessary page, which eliminates lengthy verbal descriptions. <br><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ To call the customer back, you need to find the phone number in your personal account or email (no number substitution); <br>  ‚Ä¢ You can add a contact to the black list only by contacting those.  support service. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://callbackhunter.com/">Callback hunter</a></b> <br><br>  Callback Hunter is one of the pioneers of the callback services market in Russia.  The application uses a pop-up button with a familiar design for most. <br><br>  The widget uses many criteria to analyze user behavior and refers only to "hot" clients. <br><br>  In the pop-up, you can select a unit from which the call will be made, as well as reflect statistical information (number of calls for today, etc.). <br><br>  <b>The main advantages of Callback Hunter:</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Well adapted for mobile devices, works with iOS; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Fixed payment for leads without a limit on talk time; <br>  ‚Ä¢ SMS-notifications to the client, email-notifications about the missed call; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Free version of the Black Edition (no calls, just sending an SMS at the request of the client); <br>  ‚Ä¢ High detail tariffs. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/02d/bd4/c55/02dbd4c55f989677b05d1ad2102965da.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Callback Hunter also offers an affiliate program: a return of 20% from the payment of a given friend. <br><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ The reverse side of the universal design Callback Hunter - the inability to change it.  There is also no possibility to change the standard form inscriptions.  The service changes the labels itself, and as a result, the announced offer is not always relevant for the company. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The need to fine-tune the display of a pop-up window.  For some users, setting up 13 parameters can be difficult, although by adjusting all the parameters, you can achieve maximum convenience for site visitors. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/630/07f/eb6/63007feb6008dcee864d97027d8feaea.png" alt="image"><br><br><br>  <b><a href="http://rocketcallback.com/">Rocket callback</a></b> <br><br>  The service uses a standard pop-up window, visually very similar to Callback Hunter, but using caps in the caption, which is rather a minus than a plus.  It is possible to insert a photo manager on the form.  Also available are 10 color options, corner rounding and a choice of transparency.  For the button, 6 color schemes are available and the option to select a location. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/b8d/bf3/b15/b8dbf3b15389a5afabd409c36f451fa1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  After installing the widget, you can select the automatic mode with the setting of the level of "intrusiveness" or use more subtle settings. <br><br>  <b>The main advantages of Rocket Callback:</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Customers, if desired, can receive an SMS with the name of the manager, <br>  ‚Ä¢ Ability to use your own button design; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Single fare - every 50 minutes of communication with customers costs $ 7.  In some cases, this may be inconvenient, but it gives the lowest price on the market for a three-minute conversation - 22.5 rubles. <br><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ There is no substitution of the number either on the client‚Äôs side or on the operator‚Äôs side; <br>  ‚Ä¢ The dialing of type numbers 8-999-2222222 does not work; <br>  ‚Ä¢ There is no customization of design, it is impossible to replace the inscription on the form; <br>  ‚Ä¢ The test service period is only 7 minutes; <br><br>  <b><a href="https://2calls.ru/">2CALLS</a></b> <br><br>  The system also works on the basis of behavioral factors - only interested users see the callback form.  2calls allows you to fine-tune the system for your target audience and track the statistics of calls and hits. <br><br>  The service interface is made with reference to the Django Unleashed Western with a hint that your manager is a good shooter in dealing with objections and customer problems. <br><br>  <b>The main advantage of 2calls</b> is the ability to completely change the appearance of the widget to adapt to the site design, this implies: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Ability to create a separate pop-up header for each internal page of the site; <br>  ‚Ä¢ The ability to create an individual design of the widget, which at the moment is represented only in 2calls; <br>  ‚Ä¢ You can offer your own design of the call button; <br>  ‚Ä¢ 4 versions of standard pop-up, for two of which there are 4 color schemes each. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/186/73c/63c/18673c63c42b49180609ac0a6a41cddb.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>The main advantages of 2CALLS:</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ At the end of the conversation, the manager receives an SMS with the number of the caller and the site from which the lead came; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Adaptation of the system for mobile devices, the availability of a version for iOS; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Determining the customer's phone number online, the ability to comment on conversations; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Good test period conditions: 25 minutes per month; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Detailed system of statistics and analytics of incoming calls for any period of time with upload to Excel. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/065/e86/0db/065e860dba0bee9b49673da774ff0918.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ No protection from non-existent numbers; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Correction of form display parameters requires additional settings. <br><br>  During the study, it became clear that the <b>main functions of callback services are about the same</b> : <br>  ‚Ä¢ they are integrated with CRM systems; <br>  ‚Ä¢ adapted for mobile devices; <br>  ‚Ä¢ use behavioral factor analysis algorithms; <br>  ‚Ä¢ provide call statistics. <br><br>  There is a difference in tariffs: payment is made for the number of minutes or the number of calls, depending on the specifics of the business, this may be important. <br><br>  <b>The main guidelines of the services</b> are different: <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>RedConnect</b> does not use a pop-up window to place a call, which makes the service as unobtrusive as possible. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Callback Hunter</b> has a wide pricing scale with different sets of functions and even a free version. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Rocket Callback</b> offers the lowest average cost per call. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>2CALLS</b> allows you to use custom design for pop-up and buttons.  This is important, as a unique widget will fit harmoniously into any site and reduce the feeling of obsession. <br><br>  As a result, it is worth emphasizing that the use of callback services can actually increase conversion, but the combination of high-quality, interesting content and a suitable widget is much more important. <br><br>  For us, for example, <b>functionality is important, but wide design tools are also important to maintain the integrity of all page elements</b> . <br>  For product sites with high demand, it is important to find the best value option, for others, on the contrary, it is important to adjust to each client.  Different services, as we found out, offer different possibilities, so before installing the widget, it is important to understand what kind of interaction with customers you expect from it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294544/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294544/</a></p>
