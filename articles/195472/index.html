Two reports for the evening, tea with cookies and interesting conversations in the kit.  Yesterday, for example, Google showed a glass and told them by unit.  I don‚Äôt know, whether Google was the culprit, or just the community has grown, but this time the people gathered the most variegated - not only ordinary sharpery, but also a fair number of androids, javedists, and, apparently, just people who went to the report ( that preregistered).

      So this tale will not be about Googleware, we must talk about them separately (the presentation, by the way, I liked, and left a burning desire to spend money somewhere), but about one of those who came to the light. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Young shoots </h5><br>  After the report was completed, a strong-looking uncle came out, introduced himself, and, taking the floor, shared the problem - he says he has a daughter (a pretty creation about 12 years old) who is asleep and sees how to become a programmer - even read a book, ‚ÄúProgramming for Dummies "is called.  And the uncle himself is not a programmer even once, so he got the idea to ask for the opinion of professionals.  And would not the highly respected community tell you where there are any interest clubs in which this blond creation will find fellow interests? .. <br><br>  Frankly speaking, I am still a skeptic, and I don‚Äôt see any sense in voicing such a proposal at a professional meeting - well, just like a chess champion asking where the nearest chess section is - because I went to the table with cookies.  But the question hooked me, and therefore I managed to chat with my uncle one-on-one.  And the truth is - he needed something like a circle of young technicians, but in programming :-) <br><br>  And now actually go to the essence of the issue.  While the coffee break lasted (about 20 minutes, probably), three or four people approached the uncle with the following suggestions: <ol><li>  I can give assignments and discuss any questions a child has on Skype; </li><li>  you can work with us in a startup, we will find something; </li><li>  buy a book and learn it. </li></ol><br>  I myself also gave free advice, but of course. <br><br>  All offers were rejected in the style of the game ‚Äúyes, but ...‚Äù - which, in general, is not surprising, given the age of the child and the original intention to find a ‚Äúcomputer circle‚Äù.  Along the way, I realized that professional fellows had never encountered such problems as teaching young people altogether (and many of them themselves not so long ago from the student / student bench). <br><br><h5>  What to do? </h5><br>  So my questions to the honorable community are as follows: <ol><li>  what would you do in a similar situation - when a child (yours or a friend) asks you to teach something that you don‚Äôt chop, and there are no such sections from the word ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù? </li><li>  What advice would you give this uncle what to do with the child‚Äôs desire? </li></ol><br>  The post was written regardless of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/195340/">this</a> , and, taking this opportunity, I express my respect to the author.  Directly at least something similar to independently organize ... <br><br>  PS By the way, Father has a huge respect - he did not just send the child to the school informatics, but he himself looked for some options, and chose this, albeit not quite correct, but not the easiest way.  Everything is ok here, nek that we could not help him ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/195472/">https://habr.com/ru/post/195472/</a></p>
