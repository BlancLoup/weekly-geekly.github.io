  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Simple tips for easy outsourcing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello.  I have been outsourcing for over 10 years.  Over the years, naturally, a certain ‚Äúown‚Äù methodology for the provision of services has been developed.  I bring to your attention this article.  Someone this article will seem interesting, but someone will be angry at the accidentally forgotten comma.  I will answer right away - this article gave me the first invite, my first ‚Äúprize‚Äù in the field of ‚Äúaudience sympathy,‚Äù which means that at least one person liked my work.  And this means that I spent the whole night sitting over the article for a reason. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So.  What is <i>outsourcing</i> in general?  I believe that this is a constant, episodic process of providing services to help in solving some problems and problems in a certain society of people. <br>  It turns out that we (outsourcers) help a group of people to do what they cannot do on their own.  Moreover, we do it all the time or (and) occasionally. <br>  Naturally, in outsourcing there are certain rules of behavior and communication with users.  Of course, a lot of links go on the Internet, but, nevertheless, I would like to provide my own * debut project *. <br><br>  Your attention is presented 10 "golden" rules that will help you more properly relate to his post.  These councils have already been subjected to many criticisms by representatives of outsourcing organizations, but, nevertheless, after several corrections, they were "allowed" to be published.  And so, I beg to love and favor. <br><br>  User interaction rules: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      1. <i>Do not let the user relax.</i>  This is the first and most golden rule.  We must immediately make it clear who is in the house (corporate network, work PC) master.  All statements like "I used to work in the browser ******, install it for me" should be stopped immediately.  Must be a corporate standard.  And we must follow it.  If everyone uses Opera, then EVERYONE uses Opera.  The same applies to all other programs, utilities, and so on.  Kaspersky?  So Kaspersky.  And not a word about Avasta. <br><br>  2. <i>No administrative rights.</i>  It follows from the first item.  Even if the general director ordered.  No traps.  Only "simple user", "only hardcore."  And the director needs to explain the essence of the problem of local administrators.  About the rights of the domain administrator, I do not stutter ... they, a priori, are in the same hands.  Maximum of two people in large companies.  Recently, one ‚Äúdevelopment director with a higher IT education‚Äù told me that he needed all the maximum powers in our network so that he could monitor AD on the domain controller himself.  "Shish on vegetable oil." <br><br>  3. <i>No personal laptops, tablets and other devices with access to the network and the Internet.</i>  This is the most common mistake.  Why?  Yes, because on the personal laptop it is quite likely that there are ‚Äúgates of hell‚Äù with a hotbed of viruses of all kinds and breeds, which have been waiting for 2 years to connect to the network with shared resources.  There may also be programs for downloading torrents, clog the entire Internet channel with their traffic tightly.  All this in the working network to anything.  Neither you nor the employee. <br><br>  4. <i>No "well, can we agree?"</i> .  Often, users are asked to put them "Tanks", "Dotu", "Happy Farmer", etc., so that these "adult children" could play "exclusively" at lunchtime.  This is the first step into the abyss, "well, you put the game on me, put Skype on me!"  Yes, as in some firms it is prohibited.  And in general, this practice is very much undermining the "steadfastness" of the system administrator.  I did it once - you will do it ‚Äúfor life‚Äù.  No matter how rough it sounds.  Believe me, it's better to say a firm ‚Äúno‚Äù once, than the rest of your career to suffer from ‚Äúannoying‚Äù users. <br><br>  5. The <i>system administrator must be a system administrator.</i>  No work as a loader, taking office paper packages on the 4th floor without an elevator.  This is not your job.  Even if you are a ‚Äúgood, trouble-free soul,‚Äù it is still not your job.  They started to carry paper - get ready that you will be forced to unload office furniture and make a shift because "you have always done this, now take the hammer in your hands." <br><br>  6. <i>Order on the table, order in the head.</i>  Each admin must be pedantic.  Not even so.  Every admin MUST be pedantic.  If you have on the table, in the table, in the bedside table and you can‚Äôt find the right paper, part, etc. in time.  - you may not say that everything is all right in the server room.  Most likely, the network wires are tangled in a "tangle", and under the pizza box are the long-awaited bookkeeping of the mouse. <br><br>  7. <i>Backup, and again, backup.</i>  <i>And after backup - backup backup.</i>  Every self-respecting admin has backups.  3-4 copies in different places.  Moreover, backups are not "their" files, but "only."  Literally.  In general, all that relates to the work.  Backup at least once a week.  Is there a mirror raid?  Save it!  Is there a mirror raid backup?  Backup a mirror reyd if there is free time and space (and money).  Superfluous it will NEVER be. <br>  What if the fire and fire extinguishing system did not work?  The server can just burn to the ground.  Literally.  I, working at one pharmacological plant 9 years ago, saw what the servers look like after a strong fire.  Deconstructing the screw in the laboratory in an attempt to pull out the ‚Äúinfu‚Äù, the inside turns out to be yellowed by temperature and unfit for restoration pancakes ... In such cases, backup (even a month ago) on your external media or ‚Äúcloud‚Äù will ‚Äúa billion‚Äù lift you up before your eyes Director General and (especially) accountants.  You will be a sort of "superman" from the planet Krypton.  Needless to say, this would be the best time to ‚Äúask for‚Äù a pay raise? <br>  There is a rule - there are never many backups.  NEVER.  Have free time?  Make a backup.  No time?  Schedule a backup for tomorrow.  But it is better to set up the entire automatic backup system once and ‚Äúforget‚Äù about this headache. <br><br>  8. <i>Do your work carefully.</i>  If you came to the user and solved his problem, do not be lazy "at the same time" to look into the system log, as well as see the latest update date of the antivirus.  It will save you time in case of problematic situations.  The log may contain information about hard disk failures, sudden reboot of the system, which the user simply does not attach importance to.  But maybe the next failure of the HDD may turn into a "brick".  What if there were important data?  After all, it was in your power to foresee this.  An "incident" is always easier to foresee than to eliminate its consequences. <br><br>  9. <i>Watch your tongue.</i>  <i>Nobody likes liars.</i>  If you promise to come to the user at 15:00, then you should appear at (approximately) this time.  But if you are late regularly (2-10 times in a row), then another system administrator can easily come to your place.  And suddenly, let's say, even tomorrow.  Suddenly, an OK employee is already looking for a replacement.  The management does not like to voice the decision to dismiss in advance.  So if circumstances are playing against you, then find a way to warn the ‚Äúclient‚Äù about the delay.  Believe me, it's better to warn than to listen to the ‚Äúcalling‚Äù on the phone and the subsequent ‚Äúunpleasant‚Äù conversations with the management. <br><br>  10. <i>In any situation, always remain human.</i>  Do not think that you are the coolest.  In your place there are always 100 candidates who are ready to work for a third of their salary less than yours.  Now divorced sys.adminov, as lawyers in Yekaterinburg. <br>  And (I am afraid to disappoint you) you are not a source of cosmic intelligence with unique abilities in the field of computer technology.  Although it may seem to you (at times) that everyone around you thinks so.  Sorry, it is not.  You are far from the "hacker" from the movie "Password swordfish."  Remember this always.  Especially when employees come to you for help.  Today Vasya asked to change his ball mouse to a new one, and tomorrow, refusing him (or forgetting his request), you will find yourself on the street, because Vasya has been caring for Dasha, the director‚Äôs daughter for a long time, and the director of pre-retirement age sleeps and sees ‚Äúpromising ¬ªVasu-in-law at his post.  Yes, and it happens. <br><br>  Perhaps we can continue this further, but I will stop there.  Because the ‚Äúhaunting‚Äù of the profession rather than the ‚Äúpractical‚Äù advice will go further.  Left only 10 points without which system administration is a difficult task.  I hope that this article will be read first of all by BEGINNING system administrators, outsourcers, outsourcers, outsiders, susuars, and so on ... <br>  All conclusions were made only due to my own experience and, I hope, this experience will still be useful to someone. <br>  We start to "throw stones."  Where do without it? <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/206600/">https://habr.com/ru/post/206600/</a></p>
