What is the benefit for a retailer? ‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Every day, the retailer operates with information about sales in stores, product categories, prices.  And it seems that this data is enough to be aware of what is happening in the store or network.  Is it so? <br><br>  Analyzing large data arrays is difficult for a retailer.  Large tables do not show dynamics and dependencies.  Visualization on the contrary - allows you to immediately see the dynamics of processes, the relationship between them.  Several indicators can be compared at the same time, immediately determine how they affect each other, for example, how the price change affects the turnover and the number of sales, how the change in the average bill varies with the number of checks and turnover, and so on. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/96b/272/d48/96b272d482464180b87b3afa259c1563.jpg"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To apply analytics, you need to make your perception of indicators as easy, fast and comprehensive as possible.  Visualization of information will help to get such a stereo effect on the indicators.

      <b>Visualization</b> is: <br><ul><li>  simplicity of perception of information.  Your brain can not be equal to the computer for the processing speed of large volumes of information. </li><li>  visibility.  Information in charts, graphs, diagrams is perceived better than the traditional - linear, at times. </li><li>  getting a holistic picture of what's going on.  As already said, a stereo effect is being created - what had to be sorted out for some time, is perceived in a few seconds by one glance. </li><li>  gaining more room for ideas. </li></ul><br>  In short, visualization is awesome! <br><br>  And now closer to retail. <br><br>  To illustrate this, we, <a href="http://datawiz.io/ru/">Datawiz.io</a> , will give an example. <br><br>  We used visualization to evaluate the effectiveness of the action held in the store - ‚ÄúDiscount for chicken and soft drinks‚Äù.  Using visualizations, it was determined how the price change influenced the turnover and the number of sales of several categories. <br><br>  <b>Step one.</b>  Tracked changes in turnover and the number of store sales in the pre-auction period (one month before the action).  And then built a graph for such indicators: <br>  <i>Change in turnover (horizontal), Change in sales (vertical) and Percent of turnover (bubble diameter) by store categories for one month.</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e3f/6a6/edc/e3f6a6edcf8440eab79fc7ab180a2008.jpg"></div><br><br>  From the graph it is clear that in almost all categories there is a drop in the number of sales and turnover. <br><br>  <b>Step two</b> - we built a similar schedule for the stock period to visualize how sales of promotional categories and all categories of the store have changed. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7fd/f09/330/7fdf093300914c82a98df69745e8796d.jpg"></div><br>  The graph clearly shows that in general, almost all categories of growth occurred.  Most in terms of turnover and sales, categories such as Soft Drinks, Meat, Alcohol, and others increased. <br><br>  <b>The third step</b> - to determine the percentage of growth categories Meat, Non-alcoholic beverages and other categories, we analyze them in more detail, taking into account the price and its changes for the month. <br>  To do this, visualize the following indicators: <br>  <i>Change in the number of sales (horizontal), Price change in% (vertical), Percentage of turnover (bubble diameter).</i> <br><br>  Determine the relationship between price and quantity of sales for goods of each category.  Then, we compare prices and quantities of sales for the pre-stock and promotional periods. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#982A8A"><b>Meat category</b></font> </h4><br>  <u>Sales of meat in the pre-period: turnover fell by 37 thousand UAH., The number of sales - by 615.</u> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dd1/6f7/e48/dd16f7e48be641b0b5d3ae2febc29617.jpg"></div><br>  Let's see how the price and sales of goods in this category. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/43b/a79/827/43ba798278bd4939ae6e0cf1b3be4daf.jpg"></div><br>  As can be seen on the chart, the price of chicken fillet rose by 0.5%, the number of sales increased by 35. <br>  The price for a quarter decreased by 1.26%, the number of sales increased by 812. <br>  For other goods, the price only increased. <br><br>  <u>During the promotional period, sales of meat increased: the turnover increased by UAH 1035728, the number of sales - by 28 915.</u> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/06d/f53/c1b/06df53c1b75340dfadad69b1cb6301e4.jpg"></div><br><br>  We carry out a more in-depth analysis of products from the Meat category, taking into account price changes. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dfc/2e5/9ec/dfc2e59ece9b4df38fa2fe1358900fd6.jpg"></div><br>  We observe that the price of chicken fillet has decreased by 6%, the number of sales has increased by 6,765. <br>  The price of chicken thigh decreased by 6%, the number of sales increased by 3 380 <br>  The price for a quarter chicken has decreased by 1.5%, the number of sales has increased by 6045. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc2/63c/565/cc263c565d1f407da9fa16653038896a.jpg"></div><br>  <u>Thus, already at this stage of the analysis, it is possible to make an interim conclusion that as a result of the conducted marketing activity and discounts, the turnover of meat increased by 1 million UAH.</u> <br><br>  Visualization clearly shows these changes and the dynamics of the goods depending on changes in value. <br><br>  Let's analyze <h4>  <font color="#982A8A"><b>category soft drinks</b></font> </h4><br>  <u>Sales of non-alcoholic beverages fell in the pre-intervention period: the turnover decreased by 113,893 UAH, and the number of sales - by 9357.</u> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad9/2eb/a75/ad92eba75c6b4f268e806afc79e5328f.jpg"></div><br><br>  Let us analyze the change in sales of goods from the category of Non-alcoholic beverages, given the change in price. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e2/dc3/48e/1e2dc348e65040308870ebba3601e138.jpg"></div><br>  The most significant price reduction - 8% - occurred at Znamenovskaya Non-Aerated, the number of sales increased by 112. <br>  The price reduction of 6% for Znamenovskaya highly carbonated led to an increase in its sales by 1009 units. <br><br>  <u>Sales of non-alcoholic beverages during the promotion: turnover increased by 198 334 UAH, and the number of sales - by 20 857.</u> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d4d/576/c0c/d4d576c0c27e44ab8a5417f3e5e695c4.jpg"></div><br><br>  After analyzing sales from this category with regard to price changes, we see that: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/353/9a9/880/3539a98803b24850ab98b9692dad5fd0.jpg"></div><br><br>  the cost of ‚ÄúCaravan strongly carbonated‚Äù decreased by 20%, while the number of sales increased by 10,485; <br>  the value of ‚ÄúBiola taste of orange‚Äù decreased by 23%, while the number of sales increased by 1,583; <br>  the cost of Kvass Arsenyevsky decreased by 28%, the number of sales increased by 769. <br><br>  Dynamics of change in the number of sales from the category of soft drinks <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/698/dbf/743/698dbf7439e648f285e49071b638dd17.jpg"></div><br><br>  Tracking the dynamics of sales of individual commodity items is also useful, it gives you the opportunity to choose the goods giving the greatest increase in turnover in the right period. <br><br>  The considered example of data visualization allows the marketer to significantly save time when planning stocks simply by defining the products and categories that need to be promoted.  After all, the formation of the necessary indicators for the stock is achieved not only by reducing the price, but also by choosing the right product for a discount.  Evaluation of the results of marketing activity also does not require significant efforts to select the necessary data from reports on an individual store or network as a whole, it is useful to be able to view the sales dynamics of both individual products and whole categories. <br><br>  Let's remember how often, having received information, we perceive it as a regular report.  Processing these reports, we spend an important resource - our time.  But can we be sure that we used all the possibilities of the analysis, that the data are not dead weight? <br><br>  Visualization makes it easy to determine the desired indicators without ‚Äúzagrulyaya‚Äù perception of many dry numbers. <br><br>  Our <a href="http://bi.datawiz.io/accounts/login/%3Fnext%3D/dashboard/showDashboard/">BI Datawiz.io</a> service allows <a href="http://bi.datawiz.io/accounts/login/%3Fnext%3D/dashboard/showDashboard/">you</a> to apply visualization capabilities to all main reports for retail. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/265651/">https://habr.com/ru/post/265651/</a></p>
