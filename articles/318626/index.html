Perhaps their answers will help to identify some general patterns, useful tips that will help many of us. <br><br>  Today our guest is Andrei Aksenov, the founder of the Sphinx project.  Andrew is quite skeptical of life hacks.  They are not his main assistants in increasing personal effectiveness. <a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>What do you do in the company?</b> <br><br>  Everyone in a row - that's what I am the founder of.  Sometimes I write code, but more and more such tasks as negotiations, correspondence by mail and the like appear. <br><br>  <b>One phrase (phrase) best describes how you work:</b> <br><br>  Seizures <br><br>  <b>How many hours a day do you spend on work?</b> <br><br>  From 0 to 20 hours. <br><br>  <b>How many hours do you sleep?</b> <br><br>  To 0 to 6-8 hours.  Zero happens, thank God, not every year. <br><br>  <b>Do you have breakfast</b> <br><br>  Hardly ever.  Mostly drink coffee.  Sometimes I add a sandwich. <br><br>  <b>Do you live in Moscow?</b> <br><br>  Yes. <br><br>  <b>How long does it take to go to the office?</b> <br><br>  I work from home.  Therefore, thank God, I don‚Äôt have to go anywhere.  Of course, sorties sometimes happen, but this is not a daily phenomenon. <br><br>  <b>And if you have to go somewhere, how do you spend your time on the road?</b> <br><br>  Read books. <br><br>  <b>What issue tracker'om / repository do you use?</b> <br><br>  For historical reasons, we use Mantis.  Now it is not known what we would use instead.  Repository - Git. <br><br>  <b>What tools, frameworks do you use for development?</b> <br><br>  We are a team that writes open source mainly for Linux, so we write it, of course ... in Visual Studio (smiles). <br><br>  <b>Do you have any internal projects or libraries in your company and why were they created?</b> <br><br>  There is any "strapping small things."  I would not call it internal projects. <br><br>  <b>What kind of todo-manager do you use personally?</b> <br><br>  Text files, as well as a program for Windows, which glues stickers to the desktop. <br><br>  <b>What annoys you most when you work?</b> <br><br>  When something really fails. <br><br>  <b>What professional literature would you recommend?</b> <br><br>  This is the moment of my personal ignorance.  Or, on the other hand, self-education.  I was once forced to form non-statutory methods. <br><br>  I have suspicions (I emphasize: suspicions) that I could advise Knut, ‚ÄúThe Perfect Code‚Äù and a couple of similar books.  But since I did not read them from cover to cover, I would not risk it. <br><br>  <b>What do you prefer: electronic reading rooms or paper books?</b> <br><br>  Electronic reader  Usually, I have the following reading cycle: "telephone - Kindle - telephone". <br><br>  <b>What technology (computers, tablets, smartphones) and operating systems do you prefer at work and at home?</b> <br><br>  Historically, I use Windows.  There were attempts to switch to Linux, but the habit and ease of use of Windows overpowered.  Phone - Android. <br><br>  <b>Do you listen to music when you work?</b> <br><br>  I listen almost constantly.  Sometimes I cut down in some difficult moments. <br><br>  <b>Which life hack allows you to be more efficient?</b> <br><br>  There is a set of simple standard techniques that I worked at different times.  One of them is the GTD technique with a tomato [Pomodoro - editor's note]. <br><br>  There were stickers on the desktop, physical stickers. <br><br>  Sometimes it happens that gradually everything stops working. <br><br>  <b>What applications and services can you do without in your work or in your personal life?</b> <br><br>  You will not know until you try to refuse them (smiles).  Probably, this is a standard set of Skype-mail-phone, as well as IDE Visual Studio and Github. <br><br>  <b>What would Andrei Aksenov write in a letter to the future to himself?</b> <br><br>  I do not see the point: in the future I either will not be able to well forget what was in the past;  or I won‚Äôt be interested in what that person from the past has written there. <br><br>  <b>You have come a long way.</b>  <b>And someone is now at the beginning of this path.</b>  <b>What would you recommend to a person trying to go the same way?</b> <br><br>  Since I am a developer, the advice will be about the development. <br><br>  This job is the same as the others - with its pluses and minuses.  Therefore, if in doubt or want to try yourself in something else, it may be worth thinking about it well. <br><br>  If you are still sure that you are here, then for you the second tip is an individual approach to the projectile.  I advocate algorithmic fundamentalism: ‚ÄúLearn the base, pozzons.‚Äù  Teach it very well, teach it so that it bounces off your teeth.  After that, any arbitrarily fashionable or old, time-tested technology will be within your reach, and you will cope with them rather quickly. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/318626/">https://habr.com/ru/post/318626/</a></p>
