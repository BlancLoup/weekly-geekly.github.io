  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Facebook App Center becomes global (in Russia - in a few weeks)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last week, there was information that Facebook is going to expand the presence of its App Center outside the US market.  Today, this information has become official: App Center has appeared in Australia, Canada, India, Ireland, New Zealand, South America and the UK.  Over the next weeks, the App Center will be available in Brazil, France, Germany, Russia, Spain, Taiwan and Turkey.  And in order to facilitate the work of developers from around the world, the App Center will include translation tools. <br><br>  App Center was first <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/facebook-zapuskaet-app-center.html">launched</a> in June in the United States to help users search for new applications through personal recommendations, and for people who are looking for applications specifically for mobile devices.  The rapid transition of the service to foreign markets is a very important step for Facebook.  Users outside the United States and Canada make up more than 80% of Facebook's user base and this will help increase the time users spend on the site, and also make App Center a more attractive platform for developers looking to bring their product to a wider audience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b3f/a27/595/b3fa27595b72f744b7e2421003868ed4.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a>

      Users from the above countries will now have the App Center tab on the left side of their Facebook.com homepage and in their Facebook apps for iPhone, iPad and Android. <br><br>  Announcing the expansion of App Center, Facebook also spoke about the success of the service since its launch: "millions" of people have already used it to search for new applications.  The game development company Kixeye said that the average revenue per user of War Commander and Battle Pirates games is higher among those who download via the App Center;  Disney reported that the involvement of users of the Marvel: Avengers Alliance game is also higher among those who downloaded it from the App Center. <br><br>  The step towards expanding the app store shows attention not only to the global Facebook user base, but also to developers from other countries that produce products sold there: Diamond Dash was created by Wooga from Germany, and Bubble Witch Saga - from King.com from the UK.  Halfbrick, Rovio, Soundcloud, Spotify and Deezer are also among the popular publishers, but are outside the United States. <br><br>  Now Facebook is trying to connect all this together: besides the fact that the translation function will allow international developers to port their applications to the English-speaking public, but English-language applications will also have a better chance of success among the international public in those markets where the App Center goes in a few weeks. <br><br>  In his blog, one of the leaders of the Facebook App Center, Drew Hoskins, said that in addition to the ability to translate applications, other localization tools will be built into the platform.  Developers will be able to choose the primary application language and secondary languages;  when a user from a country whose language has been marked as ‚Äúminor‚Äù by the developer, goes to the App Center app, it will be displayed in his language.  Hoskins added that before appearing on AppStore lists, translated content will be checked for compliance. <br><br>  Hoskins also noted that developers who want their applications to be considered in the new departments of the App Center as a priority should send them before Friday, July 13. <br><br>  At the moment, as reported on Facebook, 230 million people play games on Facebook every month;  More than 130 games have more than one million active users monthly.  Also, all traffic to the Facebook platform is increasing from applications on iOS and Android - 7 out of 10 most successful games on iOS and 6 out of 10 most successful games on Android are integrated with Facebook. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147487/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147487/</a></p>
