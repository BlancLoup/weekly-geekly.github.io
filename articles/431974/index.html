  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tumblr rejects strawberry content completely</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pr/gk/f9/prgkf9kfgqxhco2zsmzl1spxxkk.jpeg"><br><br>  Since its launch back in 2007, Tumblr has positioned itself as a portal for everyone and for everything (practically).  Want pictures of seals or video lessons on knitting with a cross - please.  Want pictures and video "strawberry" character - please.  However, now everything will be very, very chaste.  From December 17, 2018, Tumblr plans to completely clean up the portal of pornography of any nature and format.  Short searches on the Internet helped answer the questions why and why.  Go. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  For those who do not know, Tumblr is a social network of blogs, which can be in text, picture, animation, or video format.  Users publish what they like, share, subscribe to each other, make re-blogs.  In general, nothing unusual.  However, Tumblr for its 11 years has gained great popularity among fans of adult content.  While a friend of the social networks began to actively block such materials, Tumblr users remained untouchable, which only increased the popularity of the portal.

      However, the devil is not so bad as he is painted.  Although pornography gained great popularity on the portal, due to permissibility, its percentage of the total number of posts was, according to various sources, no more than 20%.  Yes, 20 is not 90, but not 2%.  In fact, 1/5 of the entire Tumblr. <br><br>  Initially, the biggest trouble with Tumblr was the availability of pornography in terms of copyright.  Various porn studios have fallen asleep and still continue to fall asleep with the corresponding rumors of Tumblr. <br><br>  The more pornography accumulated on the portal, the total number of blogs exceeded 100 million, the more often problems and incidents associated with this began to arise.  Some countries started blocking Tumblr on their territory precisely because of excessive pornographic content.  So, for example, did Indonesia back in 2016.  Such events reduce the number of portal users, including potential ones, which, of course, is bad for Tumblr.  In order to resolve the situation in a compromise way, a ‚Äúsafe mode‚Äù was added in the user settings.  Having chosen it, no adult material was shown to such a user.  This innovation calmed both the public, and defenders of freedom of speech, and those who were worried about the ‚Äúaccidental‚Äù finding of pornography by their children. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pq/tm/hb/pqtmhb1unptk8dxg2atzo3tont4.png"><br>  <i>The inclusion of "safe mode" in the settings.</i> <br><br>  But peace, as we know, is not eternal.  More recently, Apple has excluded the Tumblr app from the App Store.  The situation, of course, came out a bit ambiguous.  Pornography, as we know, is acceptable and unacceptable (I hate to even list its types, but the most disgusting thing is child pornography).  And some material from this category for some reason slipped onto Tumblr unnoticed by its employees and algorithms.  But Apple works on the principle ‚ÄúI will even find a pimple on the body of an elephant,‚Äù because this ugliness was already discovered by them.  This was the reason for removing Tumblr from the App Store. <br><br>  Let the people of Indonesia forgive me, but Indonesia is not the App Store.  IOS users are very, very much.  Lose this piece of cake Oath Inc.  (Verizon), as Tumblr owners since 2017, didn't want to.  Therefore, it was decided total ban of all strawberries on the portal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rr/op/jp/rropjpyybc7ndhoecxtcduqnwue.png"><br><br>  Many media researchers, analysts, bloggers and ordinary people look at it very skeptically.  Of course, if you so want to watch porn, go to a specialized site and the problem is settled.  The bottom line is that Tumblr will most likely lose a huge number of users because of its new, tight Puritan policy.  Many Tumblr-bloggers do not just spread adult content, but also try to monetize it.  Having deprived them of such an opportunity, they will no longer have a reason to remain on the portal.  On the other hand, why not? A portal without porn is not bad, is it.  There is a PornHub, in the end, for those who need only strawberries.  However, this Tumblr decision has caused outrage among people who don‚Äôt really care about the porn industry.  Many users and media experts have accused Tumblr of hypocrisy.  They say they remove porn, but with the language of hostility, racism, sexism, homophobia and other manifestations of social injustice and negativity (to put it mildly) in the direction of certain miles of the population are not in a hurry to fight. <br><br>  The words of the Tumblr team about changing the posting policy really sound funny, considering the App Store story: <blockquote>  ‚ÄúAs Tumblr continues to grow and develop, and our understanding of our influence on our world becomes clearer, we must take into account the influence on different age groups, demographic groups, cultures and mentalities.‚Äù <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Original:</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Becomes a clearer person <br></div></div></blockquote>  It sounds beautiful: taking care of children, culture, people and blah blah blah.  But we understand that such actions are not performed by large companies for the benefit of humanity, they are performed for the benefit of capital. <br><br>  Economists also said that the likely departure of a large number of users from the portal for Verizon, the owner‚Äôs company, would be almost imperceptible.  Tumblr, despite its popularity, is not a duck that lays golden eggs.  Therefore, we can conclude that Verizon is ready to easily sacrifice a part of users in order to preserve its reputation and, of course, return the project to the iOS device. <br><br>  From myself I can only add that I agree with all the parties to this ‚Äúconflict‚Äù of interests.  On the one hand, users want more attention on the culture of communication, social equality, etc.  That's right, no one has the right to offend anyone because of their color, orientation or religion.  We are all humans.  On the other hand, a portal without porn is also excellent.  True, I do not think that this very porn could be accidentally seen on Tumblr.  If you like cats, subscribe to blogs about cats, post cats, then porn should not appear anywhere on the page (I guess I won‚Äôt say, because I didn‚Äôt check it).  Also, Verizon‚Äôs motives are clear to me - reputation, self-promotion among more conservative Internet users and solving the issue with iOS. <br><br>  What do you think?  Is Tumblr justified, should they wait for users to churn out?  And maybe they realized too late in solving this "problem"? <blockquote>  <b>PS</b> This post is not among the topics that I usually describe, but I decided to share this news with you.
