Thus, the gigantic mobile gaming market is not going to slow down, and by 2019, the speakers promise an increase to USD 39.6 billion.  The main drivers of growth will be the countries of the Far East and China, reaching a total share of 57%.

      Major players in the mobile market, such as King and Supercell, rely on attracting players to their products to maintain their income.  This strategy is very wasteful, and Juniper assumes that there has been a general trend in the strategy, where the analysis of product performance is at the forefront, which in turn allows you to raise LTV and thereby significantly increase your ROI. <br><br>  Juniper also points out that tablet users spend more money on games, justifying this by saying that there are many serious games on tablets that attract hardcore users from other platforms, but Juniper notices that this will not prevent the mobile console from having niches and tablets. <br>  The full report can be downloaded <a href="http://www.juniperresearch.com/shop/products/report/pdf/forecasts/2075MHG14%2520_LOF.pdf">here</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Amazon lures developers to its new phone </h4><br>  We continue to follow Amazon‚Äôs attempts to find its place in the sun of the mobile apps market.  Most recently, they announced the release of a new (for them - the first) Amazon Fire phone, and new details are already appealing to attract developers to create applications for a new piece of hardware.  Amazon on its developer site officially announced the launch of the <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/post/Tx2I49QTWPW228V/Appstore-Developer-Select-Benefits-Expands-to-Fire-Phone-500k-Amazon-Coins-Offer.html">promotion</a> program for those application publishers who are adapting their products to Amazon Fire.  Thus, Amazon repeats some of the moves of Apple, which has always encouraged developers using the latest solutions from both the devices themselves and the new versions of iOS - up to invitations to presentations. <br><br>  But back to the stock from Amazon.  Program participants will have at their disposal 500,000 Coins ‚Äî a currency that operates within the Amazon application ecosystem.  In terms of cash, this is about $ 5,000, and each developer can receive such a bonus up to three times.  Well, perhaps such buns will help to attract yet quite cool interest of publishers to the platform.  Now it has 240,000 applications.  Note that, according to optimistic forecasts of Amazon, by the end of the year up to 3 million Fire will be shipped. <br><br><br><h4>  Ignore windows phone?  Igoniruesh 10% of users </h4><br>  And again about the ‚Äúalternative‚Äù platforms.  At the conference Pocket Gamer Connects, it was once again <a href="http://www.pocketgamer.biz/news/59332/skipping-windows-phone-youre-missing-out-on-an-extra-10-of-users">said</a> that it is not good to ignore the Windows Phone market for a mobile developer.  There are already 24 countries in the world where devices on this platform dominate the market with live iOS and Android.  The list of these countries can be seen in <a href="http://www.pocketgamer.biz/infographic/58979/the-24-countries-where-windows-phone-is-outselling-ios/">infographics</a> . <br><br>  The piquancy of the whole situation is added by the fact that the representative of the payment aggregator Fortumo this time said about the prospects of mobile Windows.  It is not a secret for anyone that such systems do not feel very good (read it in any way) in the official stores of Apple and Google, where the emphasis is on their own payments.  It remains to wait for an awkward moment when Microsoft will rigidly file down unopposed own payments, leaving behind all the volunteers in evangelizing for Windows Phone. <br><br><br><h4>  Boom Beach appeared on Android </h4><br>  After the release of Clash of Clans and their resounding success, Supercell did not rush to transfer its hit to the Android platform.  This led to the clones seizing the initiative and had time to order a pile of new land.  With the new game Boom Beach, the company does not intend to attack the same rake, and already 3 months after the world release on iOS, the game <a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/android/boom-beach-is-now-available-for-android/">appeared</a> on Google Play. <br><br>  Judging by the reviews and installs, the game is great.  The reviews are excellent, the dynamics of the installations increase, and with it the game rises in the grossing.  As of June 23, the game entered the top 100 of grossing in 34 countries and is actively growing in the rest.  Even a clash of clans scored by the clones of Google Play met the new game with joy. <br><br><br><h4>  New Tamagotchi - black and white something </h4><br>  July 12th promises us the next <a href="http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPad/Ledoliel/news.asp%3Fc%3D60170">creation</a> from the gloomy genius Aliceffekt.  Played in Oquonie?  Or maybe in Hiversaires?  Something from this saw, most likely.  By the way, very good training, if you try to pronounce these names out loud.  (The main thing is not to disturb them with something like a r'leh, who knows what).  And now, imagine how it may look like Tamagotchi in his performance ... You can not ?!  Hint: it is black and white.  And strange.  In general, not the worst combination.  And still proceedingly generated Tamagotchi generated in Ledoliel (out loud!) Is a very interesting move. <br><br>  You can interact with your creature through three verbs - Say, Touch, Give (there is still Leave, but it is for the faint of heart), to which the game will suggest continuation words, emotions, objects.  Something Tamagochi will like more, something less, and your task is to determine by what your pet‚Äôs reaction is.  We do not know whether this game will be able to change your perception of the world or turn the genre upside down, but in any case it‚Äôs interesting to see. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/227391/">https://habr.com/ru/post/227391/</a></p>
