  <section class="page js-page"><h1>I switched to mac os? No, I switched to linux? Omg I stayed on windows?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Inter-Galactic University welcomes you to the first lesson of the proto-Martian version of the alpha-galactic introduction to OS fundamentals (Operating Systems). <br>  This question takes the minds of many generations.  What to choose as the main OS?  Either Apple's OS, which can perceive the user's mental fluctuations when the user's mood changes and change the wallpaper to them in time, or Microsoft's OS, which is able to run any application from 100,346,654,084,764,650 applications developed for Windows 95, 98, Me, Nt, XP, Vista , 7, 8, IAPb (Corrected by Punto ... Black), Version GOST 3.11, and finally our favorite version of GOST 2056. You can also choose Linux 2012, 2013 and Linux of any year, version 1.2.6.8.4.5, or 3.54.665.332.76 (All version numbers are the copyright of LINUX inc.). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, welcome to the year 2084, I very much hope that you all understand perfectly well that any software purchased or downloaded from any server within the Universe 1.x.34.in.12 is cross-platform, according to GOST-12.11. 10-33 or GOST-14.11.15-34, I also understand perfectly well that the resident, registered in the galaxy 1.x.34 or adjacent, otherwise we would have either a language (encoding int 12/43/67 a barrier, or a political one (inter-democratic opposition general, taxis!). <br>  The listed conditions are designated as ‚ÄúBasic and Comprehensive‚Äù: unity of cross-platform (execution of any program on any OS), unity of language (any language that is applicable to any OS, applicable to any application written for this OS), unity of worldviews (inter-democratic Opposition General taxis!). <br>  In the absence of basic conditions, the coexistence and development of basic operating systems might be in question.  Why should there be any competition between them if the ‚ÄúBest Office Document Program‚Äù were only under Windows, and ‚ÄúIn a very stripped-down version‚Äù under Apple, and under Linux it would not exist at all.  It's just ridiculous now, in 2084, and just 72 years ago, it was quite a decisive factor in the choice of OS.  We will not mention those who died in an unequal battle "half-line" * &amp; U ^ $$ ##! @!  Psh ... psh ... Our report from the past 2012.  continues reporter Ivan Rasukhov Abramovich.  So, Ivan Abramovich, what can you say about the battle for the OS? <br>  - For the OS, I still can say that they bite!  And about the Operating Systems, that there are only three of them, and Microsoft rules everything! <br>  - This is disgusting, Ivan Abramovich!  And what caused this strange fact? <br>  - I do not know, Tatiana, but they say that Apple can only be bought along with their own hardware, and Linux does not support many "Application Programs" <br>  - Ivan Abramovich!  And what, in fact, the inhabitants of the distant 2012 mean by "Application programs" and "their own iron"? <br>  - Tatyana!  It turns out that in this unfortunate 2012 there was no ‚ÄúBasic and Comprehensive Rules‚Äù, which were adopted only half a century later.  And Apple produced (Sama!) Its "Iron" along with its OS !?  And in Linux (as well as in Apple‚Äôs OS) there wasn‚Äôt a part of programs adopted de facto in a number of industries ????  Just imagine it, Tatiana! <br>  - That's just terrible!  Dear our viewers, in connection with the sudden adoption of new rules for television ratings, we can only watch people older than 30 years.  All remaining, please leave your comments. </div>
