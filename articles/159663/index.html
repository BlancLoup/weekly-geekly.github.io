There were others that may be somewhat less well-known, but no less valuable examples from this: destroythispage.com, a story about Kyle MacDonald and his desire to exchange a paper clip for a house and many others. <br><br>  And of course, everyone wondered more than once in their life how to do this as well ... :).  Of course, I will not speak now about some phenomenal idea that was born in my head and is claiming a million dollars .. <a name="habracut"></a>  or even a million rubles (perhaps Belarusian), but you must admit, we live at such a time in which everything is possible: the offensive of 2000, facebook, Putin, iPhone and ... December 21, 2012. <br><br>  Only a month is left and we will find out, and maybe we will not find out ... what this date carries in itself.  Have you ever thought, well, what if electricity disappears, as a phenomenon, what are we all going to do - programmers, designers, layout designers, trolls, shkolota and other inhabitants of the Internet?  Let's build houses, or hunt animals, pick berries?  What professions will turn out to be the highest paid in these homegrown TOP-10?  Personally, I do not have an answer to this question, but just a month before this truly significant date, because in many cultures this year is referred to as a transitional period (it‚Äôs not clear why), I would like to ask you through <a href="http://211212.by/">211212.by</a> what you, dear readers Habra think about this?

      Yes, this site was created not without the thought of finding a cool advertiser's uncle, and if I see interest in this idea in your comments, I will definitely post all the financial results of this venture 22.12.12, as well as other stories of the coming month (if this will be possible ).  The principle of placing banner ads on the site is based on a classic auction, the minimum bid for advertising for one day is unlimited, as well as the maximum. <br><br>  Everyone knows that the main reason for the success of Milliondollarhomepage.com was the publication of a note in The Guardian, without this, I think no one would have remembered the idea, including the creator himself a week after launch.  The budget of our site is only $ 100, everything is done on the enthusiasm of several people and from the planned actions to promote the site - the main role will be played by sending a press release to domestic and foreign media on the formed pool of more than 200 sites. <br><br>  The site was developed using the php framework CodeIgniter, jQuery, jquery.countdown (clockwork), social buttons from <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/155551/">pluso.ru</a> (by the way, they have good support), a library of language definitions I told about in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/159129/">this article</a> , and a couple of simple scripts. <br><br>  I ask you not to judge strictly the idea itself, we do not in any way claim the title of geniuses, and I am sure that many people had something like that in my head.  If you still will like our amateur, do not forget to post it on your page social networks. <br><br>  With hope for a bright future <br>  Website: <a href="http://211212.by/">211212.by</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/159663/">https://habr.com/ru/post/159663/</a></p>
