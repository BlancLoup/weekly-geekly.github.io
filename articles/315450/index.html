      <u>When we discuss the experience of applying a technology, we often do not pay attention to the context of its application, because of this there is a misunderstanding, misinterpretation and application of technology.</u> <br><br>  Imagine we are on Earth, our friend Mark on Mars.  We have the same goal, to grow potatoes in our World.  The technology will use the same ‚Äúlanding in the ground‚Äù, and the results will be different because the influence of factors / variables is different for each of the Worlds.  This seems obvious, but the facts of life suggest the opposite. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">This is mark</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/478/53b/a94/47853ba94e3f48ea85370ae7dfefd021.png"><br></div></div><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Context Ignore Facts </h1><br><h3>  Fact # 1 about Consultants </h3><br>  Every year we underwent an audit of the maturity of development processes using the CMMI model, and from the guys of consultants we often had to listen to what was ‚Äúextra‚Äù and what we ‚Äúneeded‚Äù to do to make it better.  In this case, the guys do not rely on the context, but on a list of practices that can be generally used to increase the ‚Äúpower‚Äù of the development processes. <br><blockquote>  <i>Guys, you have a long release release cycle, one of the reasons is that you write TK before starting development.</i>  <i>Issue the system documentation either in the process or after the completion of the work; this will shorten the release period by two weeks.</i> </blockquote><br>  Looks like a sensible suggestion.  Now we impose a context. <br><br>  Corporate IP digests transactions at 60 billion rubles a year, 170 million rubles pass through it per day.  The system employs over 2,000 people.  Similar to our business is the Moscow Exchange and the trading operations it supports. <br><br>  The peculiarity of our KIS is that it is monolithic.  If one of the functional blocks inside is updated, errors in it can disable the entire system or workflow.  For the company, this means financial losses and subsequent overloads in the company's work, since the missed work of 170 million rubles needs to be done and to catch up with ‚Äúidle‚Äù. <br><blockquote>  <i>In the stock, currency and derivatives markets of the Moscow Stock Exchange, an abnormal situation ... Last time the exchange suspended trading on September 1, but this affected only the ‚ÄúMain Market‚Äù section.</i>  <i>This failure was the fourth in the last four months.</i>  - <a href="https://lenta.ru/news/2015/09/08/stop/">Lenta.ru</a> </blockquote><br>  Now the context makes it possible to compare which is better: <br><ul><li>  win 2 weeks out of a 3 month release release cycle, but significantly increase the risk of downtime, </li></ul>  or <br><ul><li>  for the time being, leave the TK in the place where it is, minimizing the risks, and look for other options for reducing the length of the release cycle. </li></ul><br>  In our case, there were 3 releases in parallel at work and a new one came out every month.  For us, the question was not to shorten the release cycle, but whether it is worth further increasing the frequency of releases: to release not once a month, but once every two weeks. <br><br>  And, in conceptual terms, start moving toward pulling out each functional unit from an ICD into an independent application, making the ICC a platform for them.  This will allow you to simultaneously make at least 10 releases by the number of applications. <br><habracut><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">It's mars</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e8e/29c/c87/e8e29cc875934b2380e81629a720a3e8.jpg"><br></div></div><br><h3>  Fact # 2 about Management </h3><br>  Sometimes you hear from the new high leaders such a message: <br><blockquote>  <i>Guys, in my place the processes were arranged like this, there were no problems, so we will move on to them.</i> </blockquote><br>  There is not here ... Do not rush to speak the captain of the obvious and try to open his eyes to it.  My personal statistics show that you will be regarded as refusing to cooperate and will be recorded in ‚Äústrangers‚Äù, in the coordinate system ‚Äúyour |  stranger. " <br><br>  Wait for the leader of the specific actions and already face them with reality. <br>  Over 6 years of work in the company, the Head of the Project Office has changed three times, once together with the entire Office team. <br><br>  I‚Äôm saddened by indiscriminately trying to pull all projects to create, implement and develop software to meet the requirements of PMBoK or become fashionable Scrum or Kanban.  There are methodologies tailored for IT projects, which are divided into methodologies of creation, implementation and development. <br><br><ul><li>  SureStep and ASAP for corporate software implementation projects. </li><li>  RUP and MSF as a methodology for creating large IT solutions. </li><li>  Agile: Scrum as a methodology for creating "small" forms and the development of existing ones. </li></ul><br>  And each of the software worlds makes their own adjustments. <br><br>  Output: Use the desire and energy of the head to implement the improvements, starting from those areas where they are needed and / or where he wants to give a positive effect. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Mark is planting potatoes</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e6/ead/ac3/6e6eadac3b95437fb9e0a00d11e2dcb8.jpg"><br></div></div><br><h3>  Fact ‚Ññ3 about Habravchan </h3><br>  Slips this in discussions on Habr√©.
