After all, if the buyer inattentively reads the contract, has no idea what to pay special attention to, and does not know his rights, it is very easy to circle his finger and throw money. <br>  Therefore, your attention - 7 "pitfalls" that can meet on your way in the "swimming" for the long-awaited apartment in a new house. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>1. Echo of the 90s.</b> <br>  Unscrupulous developers have learned well the experience of the organizers of financial pyramids in the ‚Äúdashing 90s‚Äù: you speak beautifully, you promise a lot - you get money (just a slogan!).  Buyers are shown a fenced site or a dug trench, on the site of which, allegedly, a house will be erected.  They give the full cost of the apartment, but in the end this money is ‚Äúscrolled‚Äù many times, is spent on meeting the needs of other co-investors, on financing the construction of other objects and on much more.  The mythical house, for which the person paid for the apartment, as you understand, is unlikely to ever be built. <br><br>  <b>2. First - the state registration of the contract, then - the money.</b> <br>  It also happens that one apartment is sold to several buyers at once.  And to find out in advance is almost impossible.  You can protect yourself by making sure that the developer is complying with Federal Law 214-FZ "On participation in the shared construction of apartment buildings and other real estate objects ...", according to which the contract must pass state registration and be entered into the state register.  Thus, subject to this law, two transactions with the same object are impossible.

      <b>3. "Brick"! = "Brick +".</b> <br>  Some fraudsters, without thinking for a long time, register a company with a name similar to the name of the developer, and sell apartments.  By the developers themselves, of course, they have nothing to do, and the buyers end up with the nose?  Be careful: little things like ‚Äú+‚Äù after the company name matter.  If a brick company builds a house, then Brick + or Your Brick (and even Brick for You) cannot sell apartments in it. <br><br>  <b>4. The cunning developer.</b> <br>  Another popular fraud method is for the developer to enter into contracts for the sale of apartments with third-party companies.  The catch is that the developer sells the same apartments on the basis of the termination of the contractual relationship with these companies.  As a result, two or more proprietors have the same apartment, and in such a situation it is not possible to return your money. <br><br>  <b>5. We demand the project declaration.</b> <br>  When receiving land plots for building a house from local authorities, the developer is obliged to transfer certain areas to them.  What does the developer do?  That's right: it sells these areas to individuals, who ultimately have no rights to them.  This can be avoided by reading the initial permits for construction, in particular, with the state contract and the protocol for the allocation of space.  This information should be publicly available: the developer must publish (place on his website) a project declaration containing information about him and information about the construction project, as well as present it to you upon request. <br><br>  <b>6. We count the meters.</b> <br>  The contract area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe apartment is often specified more than it turns out.  All in the same contract spelled out the possibility of a refund for the paid "extra" square meters according to the results of the measurement BTI (Bureau of Technical Inventory).  But these items are often written very unclearly (‚Äúwithout a hundred grams you will not understand‚Äù - this is the case).  Thus, the buyer pays for non-existent square meters.  One such inattentive buyer, the second, the third ... Can you imagine how much an entrepreneurial developer earns from this inattention? <br><br>  <b>7. "When are we settled?"</b> <br>  The contract may be blurry indicated the date of completion of construction.  And this means that the developer has no obligation to finish and deliver the house in a certain period.  And you can wait for a significant day of settling in your apartment for years ... <br><br>  <b>We summarize.</b>  In order not to be trapped and not to replenish the slender ranks of the deceived co-investors who bring claims to the courts, first of all, you need to be careful.  The advice is trivial, but it can be very valuable.  Make sure that the developer observes the already mentioned Federal Law No. 214-FZ, which provides for the conclusion of only equity agreements with the buyers of apartments in new buildings and their state registration (only after that should the transfer of money occur!).  Carefully read the contract, do not hesitate to contact the lawyers.  It will not be out of place to get acquainted with reviews about the company-developer (on forums, websites of deceived shareholders and in the local administration).  If the apartment is sold by third parties, do not be lazy to contact the developer, to make sure that they do it legally. <br>  You can minimize the risks when buying an apartment with a mortgage loan: before making a decision, the bank carefully examines the package of documents, checks the object and the developer.  In addition, banks have a list of accredited developers, some properties even have special offers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125485/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125485/</a></p>
