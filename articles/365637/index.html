For example, here and the release of a new generation of smart watches Pebble, and new items presented on Google I / O, and much more.

If earlier with the help of software one could only observe beautiful pictures, now information has been added. <br><br>  What happened to: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b4e/235/8e2/b4e2358e21c04c6d8e4361a7624bf440.jpg" width="650"><br><br>  The application consisted of three "information spaces", the main of which were steps and heart. <br><br>  At the same time, detailed statistics were available for the current day, and it was simply impossible to obtain detailed data.  The past was not clickable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/472/e92/faa/472e92faa9eb4b89a9ea27be9ed481df.jpg" width="650"><br><br>  A similar situation was with the heart rate section.  General data was saved, but it was already impossible to achieve any specifics after the day had passed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/44e/48d/908/44e48d908df848008bebe33fb27b1715.jpg" width="650"><br><br>  The same thing happened on the display, while on the display, among other things, information about your nightly activity was displayed, and therefore the update was waited by those who wanted to receive this data on a smartphone. <br><br>  Actually, this was the main feature of the update: now you can find out how much time you dozed, how much you spent in the REM phase, and how much in a deep sleep. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/62f/e86/be0/62fe86be05b446d092dfa1f99fd2e8dd.jpg" width="650"><br><br>  Data on the distance traveled and calories burned are now available in full detail for any earlier period. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a3f/e87/869/a3fe87869dac4206b53f0669aa56defa.jpg" width="650"><br><br>  The same is true for heart rate data. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ada/ea2/cda/adaea2cda8d34e5cbb9f9a5d49c6159f.jpg" width="650"><br><br>  Well, the letters have become more elegant.  This can also please the user, but what.  Now, the <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/treker-aktivnosti-wellograph.html">Wellograph smart fitness watch has</a> become even more functional. <br><br><h3>  Lumo Lift has an Android application. </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dbf/8d9/ca0/dbf8d9ca025283d6f0a92f9714580efe.jpg"><br><br>  For a long time, an excellent posture corrector Lumo Lift did not work under Android - there was simply no corresponding application.  This caused considerable dissatisfaction with users of Android smartphones, and, finally, the developers decided to correct the situation. <br><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.lumobodytech.lumolift">The Android application is</a> now released as a beta version.  There are some minor problems with the program, which will be fixed in the final release.  However, the application is fully functional, and there are no particular problems with it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d38/785/801/d3878580135ce34b1e2c6409ef62101b.png" height="550"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b5e/402/495/b5e402495e2f942110ec05a6dc49bc44.png" height="550"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2d1/fa0/45a/2d1fa045a1a61ae169856e0d53bcb519.png" height="550"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/88a/db2/23c/88adb223c7634b685d089dc7048fa2f5.png" height="550"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b82/f94/915/b82f94915d61cb6e09189ec3c0e6abe4.png" height="550"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/818/019/833/818019833a887be10153ec4cb4238010.png" height="550"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a08/79e/e00/a0879ee00de1f1351fc2edde8b9c7ccd.png" height="550"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/010/b88/a0a/010b88a0a22b2229bf294f2a5aabe2f2.png" height="550"><br><br>  In addition, <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/lumo-lift-ustrojstvo-korrektirujuschee-osanku.html">Lumo Lift is</a> now compatible with <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/lumo-lift-ustrojstvo-korrektirujuschee-osanku.html">Validic</a> 's corporate fitness platform, with which you can monitor the health and activity of users (with the consent of their own employees, of course).  And in connection with the release of software for Android, we want to provide interested users with another reason to try Lumo - <b>posture</b> code for a discount of 1,000 rubles from the current price. <br><br><h3>  Google Fit also updated! </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fe3/76b/704/fe376b70497827afdb0b41eadda63cb9.jpg" width="750"><br><br>  Google‚Äôs own fitness platform, called Google Fit, received several updates at once.  Most of these updates were announced on <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/251106/">Google I / O.</a> <br><br>  For example, it is now possible to keep records of calories burned, steps taken, distance and total user activity.  At the beginning of work, you must enter the gender, weight and height. <br><br>  All data is archived (this also was not previously), and the user can view their data at any time.  The Android OS application has got a widget, thanks to which the user does not need to open the program each time to get the necessary information.  On the desktop of a smartphone or tablet now has all the data that is updated automatically. <br><br>  Naturally, a similar widget, or rather, the dial, is also available for users of smart watches working under Android Wear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b24/72a/49d/b2472a49d42840f9990f52c8ddd0d21c.jpg" width="750"><br><br>  The platform is compatible with all sorts of trackers, smart watches, heart rate monitors and other wearable devices from LG, Runkeeper, Polar, Basis, Motorola, MapMyFitness, Asus, Noom, Withings, Adidas, Azumio, Basis.  Moreover, the Chinese company Xiaomi, which provided the interaction of its fitness band Mi Band with Google Fit, has also announced support for Google Fit. <br><br><h3>  Firmware for Pebble Time with Cyrillic support </h3><br><br>  This wonderful update is <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/251578/">described here</a> .  Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning once again that the firmware is custom, but everything works without problems. <br><br>  Two assemblies are placed here: <br><br>  <a href="https://goo.gl/n5ck9s">Pebble-snowy_dvt-3.0-russian.pbz</a> <br>  <a href="https://goo.gl/nJYYel">Pebble-snowy_evt2-3.0-russian.pbz</a> <br><br>  Installing the firmware is done by air, for which you need a paired smartphone.  A pbz file is transferred to this device, after which the file is opened in the <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/pebble-time.html">Pebble time</a> application.  If the firmware for your watch does not fit, do not worry - a corresponding warning is issued, and the firmware is not installed. <br><br><h3>  Google Brillo: The Internet of Things Operating System </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b55/a93/514/b55a93514f141b01daf2bbd9b24c15b1.jpg" width="750"><br><br>  Finally, one of the main news of the current year is the output of the operating system for IoT.  This system was described in detail by Google at its Google I / O event. <br><br>  The platform itself is based on the Android OS (how else?), And is designed to work with connected devices, and not smartphones or laptops, but coffee makers, <s>irons</s> thermostats, refrigerators, various kinds of sensors and other peripherals.  Thanks to this OS, the interaction of such devices with each other, with the user, with the system itself will be standardized. <br><br>  And in order for all devices to communicate with each other according to a single standard, the cross-platform Weave language was also released, the final version of which will be presented by the corporation at the end of 2015. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365637/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365637/</a></p>
