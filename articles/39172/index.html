  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What awaits humanity?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  According to the World Health Organization, two thirds of the babies born on the planet have some kind of developmental disability, there are practically no absolutely healthy newborns.  Thank you very much for this, however blasphemous it may sound, I must say medicine, the technologies of which give a ‚Äústart in life‚Äù to sick children who would die under natural conditions.  These children grow up, give even more ‚Äúsick‚Äù offspring, which, thanks to medicine, also gets a further start.  Such a ‚Äúdisconnection‚Äù of natural selection causes the accumulation of the genetic burden of disease in the genotype of humanity, like a growing snowball.  If it goes on like this, after 300-500 years, every born child will be given a series of operations, only after which his body can function normally. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The global deterioration of human health is aggravated by environmental degradation, dietary changes (using various food additives, dietary changes), increased information pollution, lifestyle changes (hypodynamia).  If genetic engineering does not reach that level, when the DNA correction of a fertilized egg becomes possible, humanity is waiting for a collapse, during which the Homo sapiens view may disappear from the face of the Earth. <br>  Solving this problem, humanity will throw all its strength to fight death. <br>  If you look at the history of the development of mankind, it can be noted that man made great efforts to ‚Äúcurb‚Äù nature.  In nature, he was not satisfied with much - adverse factors, with which he, as a result, successfully fights with the help of the construction of houses in various climatic zones, technical devices (air conditioners) and a number of other devices.  Man is not satisfied with the unpredictability of nature, for which he developed various sophisticated adaptations (dams for flood control, forecasts for predicting adverse environmental changes, etc.), and mankind is not satisfied with the limitations of its species opportunities.  There is a lack of farsightedness and visual acuity - a ‚Äútechno-superstructure‚Äù appeared to the human organs of vision in the form of binoculars, microscopes, etc.  Not enough physical strength - there were jacks and cranes.  Not enough speed of movement - in response to this were created cars, airplanes.  Lack of accuracy of mathematical calculations - computers appeared.  Mankind in every way seeks to bring its capabilities to 100%, while getting rid of the unpredictability of the surrounding world.  Physical death is the most important "bastion" of nature, which humanity has already begun to storm.  The question is, how will Homo sapiens cope with this bastion?  Again medical technology and genetic engineering?  Rough and dubious attempts to gain immortality with the help of cryotechnologies are already being made.  For a tidy sum, you can freeze your mortal body or head ("economy version") until better times.  A definite parallel can be drawn with the ancient Egyptians, who mummified the pharaohs, also believed that in this way one could bestow eternal life. <br>  Recent advances in the accelerating development of computer technology (in the field of computer technology, the doubling of all existing knowledge occurs every 7 years, and this process of knowledge accumulation is accelerated) suggests that people would have received immortality earlier at the ‚Äúcybernetic level‚Äù.  All knowledge accumulated by a person, his feelings, emotions can theoretically be shifted (translated) into the language of a binary code and placed on a specific carrier.  Further, this information can be programmed, technically interpreted and placed in a new, already technical, ‚Äúshell‚Äù or ‚Äúlive‚Äù in the global network of the new generation. <br>  And now let's fantasize a little.  The nn or nnn century has come.  A ‚Äúcherished‚Äù device appeared that allows you to translate all the knowledge, skills and feelings of a person into a machine code.  Once a year people come to certain institutions where they undergo a ‚Äúbroadcast‚Äù procedure in order not to lose the accumulated information as a result of an accident (in the webmaster‚Äôs language, to make a database dump).  And after 80 - 120 or even more years, after the biological membrane becomes useless and numerous transplantations of ‚Äúfresh‚Äù cloned organs do not bring the ‚Äúdesired success‚Äù, the person will continue to live in the information space.  Sooner or later, mankind, "living" in the information space, will think about why a human cycle stage in the biological shell is needed at all, because it is not perfect, and requires many resources (water, food, medicines, warmth, clothing, and .d., etc.), besides resources on the planet remains less and less.  Then the number of people arriving in the "biological form" will be reduced, and after that only a handful of people will be left to conduct various scientific experiments. <br>  How do you like such a vector of human development?  I think that is not very.  But the dead end of the development of human civilization, the limited resources of the planet hardly promise anything good to humanity in the distant future.
