So as not to torment the question "Well, what's that for a new blog?", I will immediately tell you what we are doing here. <br><br>  <a href="http://webils.ru/">Webils</a> (web-interactive learning system) is a service that allows you to deploy a quality online distance learning system for companies or educational institutions.  It was created specifically for the organization of a full-fledged educational process with all its components.  We tried to combine all the latest trends in the development of technologies and systems for training in one Russian product. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/1f/1a/1f1ad50f57b668f480f846f1dbce7622.png" alt="image">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I think everyone agrees that in many companies that have a distributed network of branches, a large number of partners or customers, inevitably there is a need for training new employees or users.  And, of course, in order to save time and money, it is logical to use video calls and web conferences for this, which (thanks to Skype and Webex) have already become familiar tools for businesses. <br><br>  And to the question " <i>why are you so different from ordinary webinars</i> ?"  we answer - Webils offers a specialized service for such distance learning. <br><br>  In addition to the possibilities of web conferencing (screen-sharing, whiteboard), video communication and webinars, it provides additional facilities for the educational process. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/66/10/6610d2f3a51c75eec82269ba5e3106e0.png" alt="image" align="right"><br>  After registering the client in the system, he himself registers his own responsible for the educational process, specialists and trainees.  All users have their own personal accounts, where all the necessary information is reflected. <br>  Through the Webils interface, they gain access to academic achievement, which is maintained in various forms during the entire training cycle. <br><br><br>  It reflects the assessments made by teachers, comparison with other students, the results of examinations and answers in the classroom.  All study materials remain in your account, including their video recording.  Users can view the schedule and receive notifications when there is a change in it, communicate through the internal message system with teachers.  They also get access to their homework, which the specialist can send to them, both at once and individually, with comments for each student. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/b1/9f/b19f8846fcc817954888ebb4db1b1175.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  The system of Webils implemented a testing system, including a timer.  With it, you can limit the execution time of the task, you can also count the number of distractions, that is, how many times a person turned off the screen or switched to other tabs (windows). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/8d/dc/8ddcf32a5df3079394f0f7c06336e198.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  In fact, this means that the specialist will have additional information about how the listener performed the task.  In addition, there is a special system that allows a specialist to create any tests or control tests consisting of various types of questions (multiple choice, audio / video questions, open, comparisons, etc.) right inside the system.  At the same time, all these tests are held online, and the teacher can monitor the assignments and comment on them immediately. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/5d/48/5d48f9c0268bfee10e52fb0713ff00cb.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  To use the <a href="http://webils.ru/">Webils</a> service, <a href="http://webils.ru/">it is</a> enough to have a microphone, a webcam and a browser with flash-player, of course, access to the Internet. <br><br>  Webils is essentially the first full-fledged SaaS solution in this area (Software as a Service), that is, all technical support and all problems related to integration, updates and other issues that scare companies when introducing such systems, all this lies with our shoulders.  At the same time, the time during which the company can start working in the system can be up to one day. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> Prices are not published on the site for the simple reason that different companies are planning completely different intensity of training.  Instead of the tariff scale, we offer clients to describe the training scenarios that they are going to implement at their place and, depending on their needs, we offer certain restrictions and costs. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109157/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109157/</a></p>
