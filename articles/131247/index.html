Let's start with the game ‚ÄúFacts in the clouds‚Äù.

      I hope this live case analysis will be useful for those who are thinking about promoting their projects at events. <br><br>  <b>Task</b> <br><br>  Everyone knows that the readability of ordinary paper investments in exhibitor packages tends to zero - regardless of the type of event.  Usually a pile of "waste paper" or ignored, or sent directly to the trash.  Exceptions are any items / artifacts that large portals like Yandex, Mail and others like to make - but they have a purely branding effect and are expensive to make. <br><br>  Our task was to come up with a paper carrier that would involve the visitor in interaction with the Megaplan brand (deeper than just flashed the logo), and had a high view rate. <br><br>  <b>Idea and implementation</b> <br><br>  As a solution to this problem, we have developed the game ‚ÄúFacts in the clouds‚Äù. <br>  The point is simple - we came up with 100 facts about Megaplan, made 100 cards (10 colors, 10 facts in each color). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d35/d57/11e/d35d5711e43ed70fa5c37e258b764a56.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A package with ten random facts (cards) + game rules is included in the package of each paid RIW member.  A participant changes cards with other visitors to collect a ‚Äúseries‚Äù - 10 cards of all colors or 10 cards of all numbers from 1 to 10. The faster the participant collected the series and took them to our stand - the better the prize you received.  The main prize (it was an aerobatic kite + flight lesson) - that will collect all 100 different facts. <br><br>  The meaning is clear - we involve visitors into the game, and in the process they memorize the facts from the cards that tell about the advantages of Megaplan.  Plus, the movement is organized at the conference itself - people walk and change cards. <br><br>  <b>results</b> <br><br>  We were afraid that the people would not cross the topic and there would be few players.  Our fears were not justified - people started coming up with the collected series in the morning of the first day, they were actively changing cards and even tweeted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/859/cf6/9cc/859cf69cc33a09b1d4ab2dd5dc26ce49.jpg"><br><br>  Now about the numbers: <ul><li>  There were 4,000 sets of hand-outs (paid RIW members); </li><li>  Finished series gathered more than 100 people; </li><li>  100 nobody collected, 99 cards collected 3 people, between whom the prize was drawn; </li><li>  About 300 people came to our booth and asked their questions about the game. </li></ul>  According to this data, we made an assumption that about 400 people took part in the game (it was not so difficult to assemble the series), we noticed about 1000 people (i.e. one out of four of those who were given out razdatku). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8c2/363/ce5/8c2363ce5eb661988659a401350575a6.jpg"><br><br>  Our share of the cost per share: <ul><li>  The very fact of the possibility of investing razdatku and rewarding (a part of the total sponsorship package); </li><li>  Design and printing of cards (40 000 pieces); </li><li>  Manager's time (3 days at the exhibition), who registered winners and answered questions; </li><li>  Prizes (we had a kite, 5 navigators, 15 yota-eggs and even the little things of usb-stuff); </li></ul>  <b>Feil</b> <br><br>  Here are some mistakes that were made during the implementation can be noted: <ul><li>  When awarding the stage a guy came out who introduced himself as a colleague of one of the winners and got a router ‚Äúfor her‚Äù.  And in fact - just steal.  We in some parking did not ask him a ticket.  Themselves to blame, but he - the rays of "happiness." </li><li>  Some attempts of ‚Äúcheating‚Äù from the Expo Center employees were recorded, which apparently had access to unassembled packages with a razdatka.  It is good that they came to their senses quite late, when most of the prizes were already drawn. </li></ul>  <b>findings</b> <br><br>  We are satisfied with the game, the task of attracting attention to razdatka and the organization of a certain movement has been solved. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/613/83e/d74/61383ed742508974f97d84485ed3a1ee.jpg"><br><br>  However, if you think about such ‚Äúchangeable‚Äù mechanics for some of your actions - I would recommend running them at smaller events with narrower target audiences - then the effect can be much higher (and also much easier to announce the game). <br><br>  <i>In the second material from our mini-series, we‚Äôll tell you about our other non-standard promotion project implemented at RIW.</i> <br><br>  <b>We also remind</b> that for startups (and any small companies) we have free SaaS-products for business automation - <a href="http://www.megaplan.ru/products/task-free.html">Task Manager Free</a> and <a href="http://www.megaplan.ru/products/crm-free.html">CRM Free</a> .
