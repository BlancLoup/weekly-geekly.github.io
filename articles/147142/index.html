Almost all this time she suffers from such bugs, which in much less serious companies are usually corrected in an emergency mode.  Its creators either do not use it and are not aware of what is happening, or it is a pleasure for them to cause torment to their users.  I want to describe here two of the most painful bugs that make Google+ a real mockery of the user.  I specifically write about it on Habr√©, because I know that Google reads it. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <b>1) Violation of the order of comments</b> <br><br>  If two comments are delivered with a small time interval (usually within one minute), then a later comment may rise above the earlier one.  This is how it happens: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/560/4d3/f8f/5604d3f8f5677528fa6265ba5d556290.gif"><br><br>  Comment 2 was set later than 1, but rose higher.  It is easy to guess that with such a glitch it becomes extremely difficult, and sometimes impossible, to understand who responded to whom.  This problem is the more acute, the more people take part in the discussion and the faster they write.  Every time you have to delete your comment, wait a minute and put it again.  I do this, many do not.  The comment system is completely broken. <br><br>  <b>2) Loss of people from circles</b> <br><br>  Previously, the man was in my circle, and then he took and disappeared from it.  And I do not even suspect this.  I can find out about it only with time, when I suspect that one of my friends does not write anything (or does not see what I am writing), but I may not even know at all.  If I have several people in circles, I can periodically check if everything is in place, but if there are hundreds of them, this is already unrealistic.  I do not know of any social site where people just take and silently disappear from the contact lists - spontaneously, without any warning or notification. <br><br>  Both of these problems have been around for months.  The first was not there at first, but in time it appeared, it was about the end of last year.  The second exists almost from the beginning.  They are not only with me - I asked many people from different cities and countries about it, they have everything exactly the same.  Therefore, this is not a problem for me personally, my browser, provider or even the country.  But Google is not interesting to anyone.  And I, and many of my friends wrote about these problems through the feedback system - no answer, no greeting. <br><br>  Google continues to cheerfully report on the introduction of all the new advanced features, but it absolutely doesn‚Äôt care about the existence of serious bugs.  I understand that there will always be bugs, but the bug is different.  It's one thing - some minor trouble, and quite another - when you can‚Äôt normally comment on posts and your circles spontaneously deflate.  And it lasts a year.  Why does Google need its billions if it cannot make a social network where comments go in the order in which they are written?  Just boggles the mind. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147142/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147142/</a></p>
