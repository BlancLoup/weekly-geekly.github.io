Dissatisfied with the work of such systems is darkness.  Let's talk about why they work poorly for us and what we can do about it. <br><br>  They do not work, because (one item or a combination of this list): <br><ol><li>  We do not know how to use them and, accordingly, we use them incorrectly. </li><li>  We do not know how to talk and, accordingly, we do it terribly. </li><li>  We are not disciplined and, accordingly, see p.2 </li><li>  We would be happy to use and talk correctly, but this damn hack only pretends that it works and that it has the functions we need. </li></ol>  With the 4th item, I'm afraid we can not do anything, except to go and find something human.  And on the rest, perhaps, we will reflect. <br><br>  What is the online counseling system?  - This is a chat with site visitors in real time.  This is a sales tool.  And, the most important is a part of your site.  This is what distinguishes such a thing from Skype, ICQ, ....

      Just a minute!  My site is not an online store.  What are sales through it?  - But you have a real business and for some reason he needed a website.  Try to convince me that it is not to increase sales. <br><br>  I will make a reservation, there are sites that use such systems to support existing customers.  This article is not for them and not about them.  Well, unless, make sure that the online consultant is really in your case only able to support. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>As part of the site, the chat window should:</b> <ol><li>  Perfectly fit into your site by style, by design. </li><li>  Being directly on the site and not cause their behavioral features of alertness or even disgust. </li><li>  Do not disturb visitors. </li></ol>  If at least one of these points is not met, refrain from evaluating the effectiveness of this tool. <br><br>  <b>As a chat window, it should:</b> <ol><li>  Be instant.  Those.  Do not load for a minute and do not send messages with a delay of 15 seconds. </li><li>  Be functional.  Those.  it should be the necessary chat features that are at hand and without too much. </li><li>  It should contain a readable text of messages with a distinct, clear separation of messages from the consultant and from the visitor. </li><li>  It should look plus or minus as a chat window that is familiar to everyone, and not like a flying saucer, or a banner of a gaming site. </li></ol>  Again, if something is not being done, efficiency is not about chatting on your site. <br><br>  <b>As a sales tool (it started here!):</b> <ol><li>  Talk on business and do not write and do not ask any nonsense. </li><li>  Respond to questions quickly (for those who do not understand what ‚Äúfast‚Äù is, I will explain - very quickly) </li><li>  Show activity, but ... (see item 1) </li><li>  Make a profit, and not be a fun toy for managers. </li></ol>  There are a lot of points and it‚Äôs hard to imagine how to put them all together.  Let us analyze the most common mistakes. <br><br><h5>  Logo of the organization in the chat window ( <i>"Part of the site.1", "Chat window.2 and .4"</i> ) </h5>  The first thing they are trying to do is to stick their logo in the chat window.  This is a tribute to the times when OK systems used pop-up windows (many people still use them today, but I still write about modern systems. ‚ÄúPart of the site.2 and .3‚Äù).  All inserted a logo to indicate the ownership of the window site.  No more doing this!  Everything.  The chat window is now built into the site itself.  The fact that it is provided by a third-party organization is known only to you (If, of course, a good service provider did not include a link to himself there).  The client is not in the know.  Give him a convenient window.  There are cases when the logo is harmoniously in the window and does not interfere, but there is a minimum. <br><br><h5>  Making the chat window ("Part of the site.1") </h5>  This is the weak point of most systems OK.  There is a set of presets.  Chose the appearance of the proposed list and work in it.  The list is naturally less than the number of sites on the Internet <s>ah</s> .  If the system allows you to turn the window into the tail and into the mane, as well as load your custom HTML window, then everyone feels ‚Äúwell, just a designer.‚Äù  Mark this urge, unless you are confident in your abilities at all 120%.  This stage is one of the most important in your entire history of your relationship with OK.  If the design of your site is the fruit of your webmaster‚Äôs creativity, entrust it to him, drawing his attention to the ‚ÄúChat window .2, .3 and .4‚Äù.  If a third-party studio did the site for you, talk to them.  Surely it will not be expensive.  If those who created your website no longer exist, try contacting any other studio you like.  At the exit you will receive an exclusive chat window that will belong to your site.  Take your time.  Very important! <br><br><h5>  "Manual" activity of operators ("Sales Instrument.4") </h5>  You are connecting to a system where there is an active call for visitors, but not setting up automation.  Whether there is no time, or laziness, or it seems to be more expensive with automation, and we save.  If your manager does not stare at the list of visitors all day and frantically does not write questions to them first, then you do not seem to need an online consultant.  If he does all this, then either he works for your food, or you absolutely do not value his time and your money.  What to do?  - Automation!  The normal state of affairs is when your manager sits and goes about his business, and the system at this time ‚Äúfrantically writes ...‚Äù.  As soon as someone pecked at the message of the machine (which, by the way, writes on behalf of the manager), the manager receives a signal that there is a chat and only then it is included in the chat.  What exactly writes the machine - in the following examples.  Why then manually call visitors, you ask.  Very "why."  It is needed in order from time to time to correct the work of automation, if you suddenly saw an interesting visitor, on whom the machine did not work. <br><br><h5>  "Hello.  Can I help you with anything? ‚Äù(‚Äú Sales Tool.1, .3, .4 ‚Äù) </h5>  99% of those who connect to the system with the ability to filter visitors and send them a personalized message depending on the page, referral source, search query, etc., postpone the construction of these same filtering scripts and then send something like ‚ÄúHello .  Can I help you with anything? ‚Äù  There is nothing more permanent than temporary.  If you do not do it right away, you will never do it.  Filtering scenarios need to be supplemented all the time, but you need to start right away. <br><br>  Yes, ‚ÄúHello.  Can I help you with anything? ‚ÄùIs better than nothing.  But you have no idea how much you lose by confining this phrase. <br><br>  I'm sitting on the site.  The site sells matches and nuclear reactors.  I searched in Google for a reactor and came here.  I sit, I choose.  And here I am "Hello ...".  I am busy with reactors, why should I think for you, how can you help me?  You can - help.  You can not - piss off and do not bother.  In the case, please.  As one client said, it is impolite not to answer a specific question.  I am aware of the search question.  Why not ask: "What do you want, a nuclear reactor, or what?".  Not!  Because it is nonsense.  I was looking for a reactor and sitting on it stare.  It is better to "How can I help?" <br><br>  Ask: ‚ÄúAre you interested with two or three circuits?‚Äù - A specific question that breathes with the desire to help the visitor.  If he has even the slightest desire to buy, he will answer this question.  If he went to warm up - let him stomp, do not miss him. <br><br>  IMPORTANT: Always have the following questions ready for the case of two circuits, as well as for three!  (‚ÄúSales tool.2‚Äù).  Remember that if a visitor wrote 1 message in chat - this is not yet a chat.  Chat only when a visitor received 2 messages.  That's when he is at your disposal.  Therefore, the conclusion of the visitor to write the first two messages should occur in the shortest possible time.  So look for an "indicator spy" to respond instantly. <br><br>  And so - for every interesting request, for every identifiable advertising campaign (and there are most of them on the Internet), for every useful visitor. <br><br><h5>  Form of selection of the department for treatment and the form of a preliminary indication of the name, email, God forbid, the phone. </h5> A visitor on the site is a delicate matter.  It is difficult for him to cross the threshold and start a chat with you.  You seem to have hung a chat window, while you yourself are building a wall in front of the visitor.  Each such form is an obstacle on the visitor‚Äôs road to chatting with you (‚ÄúChat window.1‚Äù).  I am deeply convinced that both of these functions are necessary, but only for those who have a live chat - a tool of support.  Separate attention is worthy of the form of choosing a department in which there is only one department.  Here, I think, comments are unnecessary.  Put the receptionist on reception of all chats.  Let him distribute to departments himself, AFTER the chat begins.  Let your manager himself ask DURING CHAT, what is the name of the visitor and how to contact him.  It is not difficult! <br><br>  If the article seems interesting to the community, I will try to gather my strength and consider more situations that impede the effective use of OK. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137686/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137686/</a></p>
