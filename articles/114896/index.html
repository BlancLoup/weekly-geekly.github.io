  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where to go artists and what awaits them in the Internet space</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  One of the comments that I saw on the Habrahabr.ru website sounded like, ‚ÄúWell, why are there no normal sites for creativity in runet - with a large audience, good design and excellent content?  Everywhere, either design or freelance ... And for musicians and artists, there is nothing normal at all ... ‚Äù <br><br>  Let me tell you a little about what we do and how we help creative people to realize their talents, well, at least, to declare them.  And I would also like to share my observations during the work of the Russian-language version of the site. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We are a kind of "house of talents" and, moreover, an international house, because  the team sincerely believes that creativity knows no boundaries and all that.  Small difficulties and problems in the form of a language barrier sometimes still arise among fellow actors on their thorny path to fame, despite the fact that they communicate in the language of art.  Therefore, our platform currently operates in six languages ‚Äã‚Äã(English, Russian, Turkish, Spanish, French, German), and we plan to add two more in the near future.  We work in several directions, namely music, cinema, photo, design, fashion and fine art. <br><br>  Interactive communication on the site takes place through contests or, as we call them, Creative Invites.  We announce the competition, the participants register on the site, post their portfolio (if there is something to lay out), then they also upload their application.  The application is a work (sketch, photo, music track, video, etc.) and a short description to it.  After the end of the competition, voting begins, in which everyone who wishes is taking part, and for this it is not necessary to register on the site, because  You can vote through your Facebook account.  When the voting ends, the organizer of the competition usually looks at the beginning of 10-20 works that received the most votes.  If for some reason these works do not pass, although this happens very rarely, then the organizer chooses from the general list of applications.  Sometimes we immediately indicate that the organizer plans to review all the works regardless of the vote.  For example, in the case of the competition from the brand Ann Klein to redesign the existing logo.  Thus we reveal the winners.

      I would also like to note that we are trying to organize contests not with cash prizes, but concentrate more on an interesting and rewarding experience for our artists.  For example, a recently launched competition from the legendary group Queen.  Yes, there is a slight contradiction with the statement above.  Yes, the prize is a cash one, in the amount of one and a half thousand bucks, but the experience itself is amazing - creating a design for a T-shirt for the 40th anniversary of Queen‚Äôs musical career.  If I were a designer, I would at least make an attempt.  But in addition to this, a T-shirt with a design will be sold in the online store of the group, the funds will be sent to fight AIDS.  Unique experience and noble pursuit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c0b/2b9/ff1/c0b2b9ff14bb92b9787b79961926c0b4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  But one of the cool contests that recently ended was a contest from comic grandfather Stan Lee - the creator of such characters as Spiderman, Fantastic Four, X-Men, and others. The prize is a trip to the 2011 Comic-Con in San Diego (USA), a meeting with Stan Lee and a trip to Todd McFarlane‚Äôs studio.  This will be a unique experience for the winner (I will say, because the winner has not yet been announced).  After all, you never know what such opportunities can turn into.  This is an important element of our concept - opportunities and positive experience. <br><br>  Here are a few heroes from 2 thousand applications that we received.  On the site you can see such a riot of fantasy that it is hard to put it down. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/54d/f4b/29e/54df4b29ea721c20a01242223b5baf40.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/592/a90/3da/592a903da3a7b1dbaec77e87ac0bac6e.png" alt="image"><br>  In the beginning, of course, there is a skepticism.  Having launched the Russian version of the site, we analyzed whether there is something similar in runet.  Distantly similar, of course, is.  As the author of the comment correctly noted, there are a lot of websites with contests for designers, there are several for photographers - like photosight.ru and a couple more conformable in name, there are also DJs, such as promodj.  I don‚Äôt want to say anything bad about them, we successfully cooperate with some of them.  But, as a rule, they are local (focused on Russia), publish contests from Russian companies, or translate publications from foreign sites without cooperating directly with them.  Freelance, I would not belong to this category, because  They are still a site for job search and tender announcements, and they do it quite successfully. <br><br>  Our difference from the above-mentioned platforms and the like is that we do not limit the participants geographically, and the range of competitions is broader.  The site, of course, exists relatively recently.  In this version - a little over a year and during this time about 100 Creative Invites have been implemented.  We usually receive from 300 to 2 thousand works-applications for one competition.  The subject of the competitions is from design to dance with such names as Stan Lee, Lady Gaga, Queen, Anne Klein, Adidas and the UK Olympic team, Paul Taylor and others. <br><br>  Of course, no technical problems can not do.  As it turned out recently, for example, the site does not support the Opera browser, which, for example, is not used at all in the US, and 35% of Russian Internet users work with this browser.  It was, of course, news for American colleagues, yes, for me too.  All over the world, this browser has lost its relevance, and in Russia it is still very popular.  But we are working on it, although there are enough dissatisfied participants.  But such technical difficulties always arise when a large mass of people begin to use the site.  At the testing stage, it is difficult to foresee everything, so Opera‚Äôs browser was missed. <br><br>  Returning to our users, the number of unique visitors has rapidly increased with the addition of the Russian and Turkish versions of the site, which indicates an increased interest and a lack of similar resources in these countries. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/056/c83/3a9/056c833a9c3e31e79b01ae3933320d77.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I was also struck by the rapid growth in the number of visits from Armenia.  In a recent competition from the music band Maroon 5, one of the winners was the representative of Armenia.  And the percentage of visits today is around 3% of all traffic, which is not bad for growth for the month.  Below is the work of the winner from Yerevan. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f1c/61b/e84/f1c61be842f60bf9cca40f08f1523e34.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Another discovery for me was how actively the population of Turkey uses the Internet.  Traffic from this country on the site is around 15% and this is an increase over the month.  The country ranks third in the number of Facebook users.  Our employee said that even her grandmother has an account on Facebook, from which I opened my mouth a little.  And I will not say that in every competition we have at least one representative from Turkey among the finalists, which is impressive. <br><br>  Design and photo contests are still very popular.  Either because this category of people is more actin and ready to share their ideas, or because contests, for example, for DJs are too narrowly limited and niche.  For example, in the design competition for Queen, which I mentioned above, we did not have time to announce a competition, as we already had about 100 works. <br><br>  The first contests and the platform itself in its current form were launched in July 2009.  We started working with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra;  model Naomi Campbell;  director and Oscar nominee Fernando Maralis, etc. <br><br>  In addition to contests on the site, you can still upload your portfolios and receive comments, exchange projects or order projects, which is already happening between the site participants and without our control. <br><br>  Our platform can be called whatever you like - a social network with a creative focus, an online platform for competitions or, as we were called in the media recently, a marketing agency.  The essence of this does not change - an interesting experience and the implementation of creative ideas. <br><br>  Thanks in advance for the comments and if the community likes the publication, I will be happy to talk about other observations, competitions and their results. <br><br>  We are always looking for talents and will be glad to see you in our community, to hear your wishes and comments. <br><br>  Naida Volkova (Talenthouse.com) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114896/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114896/</a></p>
