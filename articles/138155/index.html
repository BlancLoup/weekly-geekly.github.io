      <b>TOP10 services provided by freelancers in RuNet:</b> <br><br>  <b>1. Web programming</b> <br>  The dynamic development of technology leads to the need to adapt new devices to work with the Internet, as well as the emergence of new applications that will be of interest to modern users. <br><br>  <b>2. Website Design</b> <br>  Website design development is necessary for the individualization of the company, its separation from the rest.  Today, there are fashion trends on the Internet, following which the organization positions itself as a modern, dynamically developing brand. <br><br>  <b>3. Copywriting</b> <br>  Well-written texts contribute to fueling interest in the company from the potential consumer, which entails an increase in sales.  In addition, with the help of copywriters it is possible to convey any information to the reader in a language he understands.  In a huge flow of information, a competent copywriter who can ‚Äúhook‚Äù the public is very relevant. <br><br>  <b>4. Translations</b> <br>  The need for translations arises for two reasons: the expansion of information flow and the erasure of boundaries in the field of business.  With the help of translations, it becomes possible to learn about situations and opinions of experts in all spheres of life, as well as to establish stable relations between business partners from different countries. <br><br>  <b>5. Printing Design</b> <br>  Print design is a huge success due to the development of outdoor advertising.  There are more and more carriers with which you can tell about a product or service, and the more interesting the design of a particular carrier, the greater the likelihood that a consumer will pay attention to your company. <br><br>  <b>6. Logos</b> <br>  The logo is the face of the company.  The logo accompanies almost every information, whether it is an employee‚Äôs business card, a billboard on the highway or a video on the central television channel.  The logo should combine several qualities: compactness, capacity, memorability.  Professional logo design guarantees the company a considerable share of success. <br><br>  <b>7. Drawings and illustrations for games</b> <br>  Games have enjoyed success at all times, but today their number is rapidly growing due to technical capabilities and the development of Internet technologies.  In addition, games have become part of the corporate strategy for promoting a product or service. <br><br>  <b>8. Interior Design</b> <br>  Interior design is necessary in connection with the development of the construction industry and the emergence of opportunities for the realization of any ideas in interior design.  Specialist in interior design takes into account all the features of the room, as well as the preferences of the owner and fashion trends.  That is why the rooms decorated with the help of a designer are close to the ideal. <br><br>  <b>9. SEO specialist</b> <br>  Search engine optimization (SEO) is necessary to promote the company's website to higher positions on the necessary queries in search engines on the search results pages in order to attract a potential consumer to the site. <br><br>  <b>10. Corporate identity</b> <br>  The development of a corporate style of a company is working on how effectively a company will be represented on the market, how recognizable and memorable it will be for customers and how seriously it will be able to attract the attention of the consumer so that he becomes interested in the product or service she offers. <br><br>  <b>Why exactly they?</b> <br>  It is obvious that all these professions do not require permanent presence in the office, since it is enough to have a computer for activities in these areas.  The possibility of finding a home and communicating with clients at a distance attracts specialists from the above list to freelancing. <br><br>  <b>Trends</b> <br>  As for other specialties, at present, various studies are being carried out, proving that remote collaboration is perfect for a wide range of specialties.  At the same time, the efficiency of a remote employee‚Äôs work often exceeds the level of the employee‚Äôs efficiency from the office.  That is why an increasing number of specialists from various fields of activity are moving to freelance.  In particular, the following specialists appear: <br><br>  1. Handmade <br>  2. HR manager <br>  3. Psychologist <br>  4. Knitted and textile design <br>  5. Travel Agents <br><br>  In addition, we found designers of various communication systems, business consultants, photographers, videographers and other specialists in the freelancers' lists, who at first glance are not quite suitable for working remotely. <br><br>  <b>What's next?</b> <br>  The main task of modern freelance exchanges is to attract specialists from various fields of activity and create suitable conditions for them.  <a href="http://www.prohq.ru/">The remote work exchange PROhq</a> tries to follow the latest trends and constantly improves its services, providing freelancers with innovative solutions.  After all, we are confident that remote cooperation has excellent prospects! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138155/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138155/</a></p>
