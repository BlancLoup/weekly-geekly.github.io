  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Outsourcing online stores</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I want to talk about a fairly young and developing direction in servicing e-commerce enterprises - outsourcing for online stores. <br><br>  Very often, both beginners and developed e-merchants have questions regarding certain principles of functioning of an online store as a business enterprise.  These may be issues related to the opening of the store site, difficulties in promoting it, attracting customers, and most importantly, issues regarding its operation.  The e-commerce market in Russia is relatively young and is only gaining momentum, which is why the answers to these questions are not always found. <br><br>  There are still not enough professional marketers in the e-commerce market, and most of them are busy promoting their own Internet businesses, and you can count the sources of useful information about Internet commerce on the fingers of two hands.  In this situation, it is logical the emergence of companies that provide outsourcing services for owners of online stores.

      The scope of e-commerce outsourcing, due to the e-commerce developing in the RuNet, is little filled, most beginners and developed online stores are trying to solve the arising difficulties with existing staff who are often not effectively coping with their responsibilities, like in the USA and Europe Outsourcing services have long found their use in the Internet business. <br><br>  Professional employees of such companies cope with problems that arise in the work of the online store.  Whether it‚Äôs a problem with the storage location of the product being sold, its packaging, shipping, and in most cases courier delivery, or problems attracting new customers - all these issues are in the field of activity of outsourcing companies. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Also, often, there comes a certain stage in the development of an online store, when its owner realizes that everything seems to be used and used to improve the efficiency of the enterprise, and the expected increase in profits does not occur.  In such ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù situations one can also resort to the help of outsourcing companies and attract fresh ideas and thoughts for more successful trading via the Internet.  By transferring responsibility for the execution of certain functions of an online store to outsourcing, you can save yourself from the most problematic and costly elements of your online store by entrusting their execution to the hands of competent employees. <br> <a href="http://www.ritm-z.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/395/e32/3ad/395e323ad89bf4fe6aca6a1bbe18266b.png" align="right" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  One of the companies offering outsourcing services for online stores is <a href="http://www.ritm-z.ru/">Ritm-Z</a> . <br><br>  The company provides a full range of services for organizing the work of your online stores.  The company's specialists will provide you with professional support and assistance in the opening, development and operation of your online store.  You can outsource the management of your Internet business, from performing the functions of an online consultant to ending with the delivery of your products to the customer‚Äôs threshold.  Probably, you have repeatedly encountered the incompetence of couriers who, delivering an order to a client, do not even bother to thank your clients for the purchase.  But direct contact with the client is a fundamental factor for his retention and encouragement to repeat purchases!  To fulfill your order, a wide range of effective methods will be used to service incoming online orders and organize your online business. <br><br>  Priority direction of the company Ritm-Z, its basis and core is the provision of services "online store manager".  The difference between this service and ordinary call-centers is that the manager, like the owner of the online store, is interested in selling your products, and not just sits on the phone and gets a stable wage for hours.  A professional manager is ‚Äúsick‚Äù for each order, and, of course, understands the principles of an online store, knows all the product movement chains, knows how to find a language with dozens of contractors and partners who provide its work (suppliers, courier services, etc.).  The main thing is that the manager ensures that the customer is always satisfied with the purchase and feels the focus of attention.  These factors lead Internet projects to success and popularity.  It is safe to say that the manager is in the hands of the present and future of the online store, however, like any other company. <br><br>  At your service are flexible tariff plans Ritm-Z, a distinctive feature of which is that you pay for the company's services at a fixed cost and strictly for the orders made.  No aimless pants sit - pay only for the result! <br>  <a href="http://www.ritm-z.ru/service/manager.php">On the</a> Ritm-Z <a href="http://www.ritm-z.ru/service/manager.php">website,</a> you can find a complete list of services and get professional help from company employees. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119777/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119777/</a></p>
