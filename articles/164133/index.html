      <b>Question 1.</b> When will parcels quickly reach Russia?  How in Royal Mail, so that letters and parcels can reach any part of the world in a day or two? <br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <i>Our task is to achieve, by the reform of the postal industry, by 2018, the speed of delivery of postal items reaches 1 day within one settlement, 3 days between cities and 7 days between any settlements within the country.</i>  <i>Indeed, now even in Moscow, the package can go for a very long time: the term of shipment within the capital is comparable to the date of shipment within the European Union.</i>  <i>We must fight this.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Of course, international mail should also be delivered in accordance with international standards, but now the priority in the development of mail is to establish work within Russia.</i> <br><br>  <font color="#e6e6e6">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</font> <br><br>  <b>Question 2.</b> Why in the Russian Post when sending a parcel, say, from China, does it fly to Moscow, and then back through half the country?  I understand, logistics, but probably it is not necessary for the Russian Post to cry that everything is difficult and expensive when such routes - of course, the cost will not be cheap!  :( <br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <i>Indeed, at present, 75% of international mail is sent through Moscow, this is the existing logistics of the Post of Russia.</i>  <i>Of course, it needs to be changed, but this is a matter of reform throughout the postal industry.</i> <br><br>  <font color="#e6e6e6">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</font> <br><br>  <b>Question 3.</b> When can I track the movement of parcels? <br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <i>You <a href="http://www.russianpost.ru/rp/servise/ru/home/postuslug/trackingpo">can do it</a> now.</i> <br><br>  <font color="#e6e6e6">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</font> <br><br>  <b>Question 4.</b> When will they stop stealing at the post office (theft, the substitution of things)?  Some goods go without tracking numbers (for example, part of the parcels from the <abbr title="Secondary School of Alcoholics, source - www.sokr.ru">USA</abbr> change the track at customs) and are not tracked - it is impossible to find them and make any claim for them (therefore, most of them are stolen by mail).  However, the parcel has an address and full name, therefore, there is a technical opportunity to confirm the identity of the addressee.  Why is there still no personal account and parcel search service by address / full name? <br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <i>Currently, the Post of Russia has 42 thousand branches, which employ more than 360 thousand people.</i>  <i>In remote areas of Russia, the post office is often the only corner of civilization.</i>  <i>In this case, many postmen perform a volume of work that goes far beyond the limits of their official duties.</i>  <i>Examples of their heroic work can be found <a href="http://www.russianpost.ru/rp/company/ru/home/creativ/arhive/contest03">here</a> or <a href="http://www.russianpost.ru/rp/company/ru/home/creativ/post">here</a> .</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>It is clear that with such a scale, unpleasant things happen at the post office, information about which is distributed particularly quickly.</i>  <i>They cannot be avoided, but it would be incorrect to blame the entire postal industry for deliberate theft.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>At the same time, the function of the personal account should appear on the website of the Post of Russia in 2013, and we will discuss the possibility of tracking packages by name and surname with the management of Post of Russia.</i> <br><br>  <font color="#e6e6e6">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</font> <br><br>  <b>Question 5.</b> When will cease to glue tracks on some types of foreign parcels?  And track one number or at least enter a match and let it be tracked one by one. <br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <i>In some cases, the assignment of a postal identifier is a paid service that the client can use or not.</i>  <i>In this case, when the parcel passes through the border, in any case, it will be assigned a Russian identification number.</i>  <i>In this case, it seems to us inappropriate to reject local postal identifiers, as there is a risk not to track the passage of the postal item, if it was not assigned a number by the sender from abroad.</i> <br><br>  <font color="#e6e6e6">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</font> <br><br>  <b>Question 6.</b> What if you remove from the mail all the side services - starting with paying for communal services / loans / mobile phones, sending money, selling flowers-cards-tablets and other lottery tickets - despite the fact that there are often no ‚Äúkey‚Äù envelopes and suitable boxes for parcels  It would be reasonable to divide this whole economy into independent organizations and leave small effective offices with highly paid, polite professional staff focused only on acceptance / issue / storage, etc.  correspondence / parcels?  And the second half of the room to rent for the expense of the first there is no one <abbr title="Oooooh green-eyed takiiiiiii">LLC</abbr> ‚ÄúPostal soviet shop‚Äù? <br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <i>Our goal in the modernization of the Post of Russia is to preserve all existing post offices, taking into account the social importance and the unique mail infrastructure.</i>  <i>At the same time, the only real way to preserve the existing network of branches is to create a distribution network based on the Post of Russia, which could make money on a large volume of goods delivery, and not only and mainly on the delivery of postal correspondence.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>At the same time, the advanced experience of foreign postal networks shows that this model works: in the G8 countries, the contribution of e-commerce to <abbr title="Temporary rotational settlement, source - sokr.ru">GDP</abbr> growth exceeded 20% over the past five years.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>This means that it is additional commercial services that will ensure not only survival by mail, but also the development and diversification of the revenue base.</i>  <i>Moreover, to increase profits, some of the functions of post offices can be given to private businesses on a franchise basis.</i> <br><br>  <font color="#e6e6e6">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</font> <br><br>  <b>Question 7.</b> When will it be possible to arrange the parcel via the Internet completely at home, print out the address sheet and all the necessary documents, pay with a card, pack it and come only to return? <br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <i>Indeed, Pochta Rossii should offer its customers such an opportunity, and the key to successfully creating an e-commerce infrastructure based on the postal network is the introduction of a convenient and modern mechanism for sending mail cargo for both private and legal entities.</i>  <i>Making parcels via the Internet is a convenient mechanism for interacting with mail, but it can work far from everywhere.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The vast geography of Russia still does not allow in certain regions to bring the penetration of broadband Internet access to acceptable indicators.</i>  <i>In some federal districts of Russia, <abbr title="Broadband Access">broadband access</abbr> services are available for 20-25% of residents.</i>  <i>At the same time, the computerization of the population is also far from ideal - it does not exceed 50% in Russia as a whole.</i>  <i>In other words, many residents of the country so far can only come to the post office and issue documents for the parcel in the traditional way.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>At the same time, there are also highly developed regions such as Moscow or St. Petersburg, where modern postal services are in high demand.</i>  <i>That is why we plan to build the work of the postal network diversified - depending on the region, taking into account many factors.</i> <br><br>  <font color="#e6e6e6">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</font> <br><br>  <b>Question 8.</b> Could it be to make a time for filing a claim not 2 months after sending, as it is now, but in a week or two?  And the search term is not 6 months (nightmare), but 3-5 working days?  After all, they should know where the parcel is / where it is sent and even if it does not have time during this time to arrive at its destination, but at least it will be found somewhere. <br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <i>You can issue an application to search for a potentially lost parcel the next day after the expiry of the delivery deadline.</i>  <i>In the case of sending a parcel across the territory of Russia, this period is a maximum of 42 days in the case of sending a parcel from one remote region to <a href="http://fc.russianpost.ru/DownLoad/For_Site/Uslugi/Post/Doc26.doc">another</a> .</i>  <i>For example, from Anadyr to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky.</i>  <i>Thus, taking into account the day of making the parcel, the maximum waiting time until the application for the search is submitted is 43 full days, that is, no more than one and a half months.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>To give an answer on the status or find a parcel mail must within a period of 5 days to 2 months.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Information about the search term lost parcel in 6 months is not true.</i> <br><br>  <font color="#e6e6e6">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</font> <br><br>  <b>Question 9.</b> When for the Russian Post both for foreign and domestic shipments impose strict time requirements upon violation of which our Mail (which calls for speed) would be without courts to pay fines, you will say, there are deadlines, but these are the deadlines set by the mail and unfortunately they are not respected, and in court it is difficult to prove anything because everything is vague, between international and domestic, etc.  My parcel after customs from the 4th is not clear where it is - I can‚Äôt even file a search list normally - I have to get an invoice from the seller for it!  And then, after receiving not on time, - and also provide a statement from the seller that he is not against receiving compensation by me !!! <br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <i>You are absolutely right: the speed of delivery and the level of reliability of mail items leave much to be desired.</i>  <i>We carried out a comprehensive analysis of the situation in terms of delivery of shipments, their compliance with the approved standards and so on.</i>  <i>Although without such an analysis, the problems are obvious: today the number of written correspondence delivered throughout the country within the control period is less than 70% of the total number of items, the deadline for sending within Moscow is comparable to the period for sending between the EU countries, the number of complaints is growing by 8 10% annually.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>We understand that low speed and other mail problems cannot be solved by one specific action or action - the entire postal industry needs to be restarted.</i>  <i>It is necessary to change the regulatory and regulatory framework and bring it in line with modern conditions, to introduce a new financial model, which should be built on the basis of the needs of the population and business.</i>  <i>We are planning to do this closely in 2013.</i>  <i>In your particular case, if it is still relevant, please write to the external communications department of the Ministry of Communications and we will transmit the information to the ‚ÄúRussian Post‚Äù.</i> <br><br>  <font color="#e6e6e6">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</font> <br><br>  <b>Question 10.</b> Why in my 1.5 million city to send a parcel abroad is possible only in one central office, moreover, that the letters without any problems leave any?  I see no fundamental difficulties in sending any items from any post office. <br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <i>In accordance with the current rules and procedures of ‚ÄúPost of Russia‚Äù, parcels should be accepted in all post offices.</i>  <i>In some cases, heavy parcels can be an exception: not all post offices are equipped with the necessary equipment for receiving and processing large-sized goods.</i>  <i>Such equipment is not installed in the so-called mini-post offices, located in shopping centers and having a very small area.</i>  <i>Please send the address of the branch where you were refused to accept the parcel to the external communications department of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media.</i>  <i>Together with the Post of Russia, we will definitely find out all the details and deal with your case.</i>  <i>Thank!</i> <br><br>  <font color="#e6e6e6">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</font> <br><br>  <b>Question 11.</b> Why are the technologies of the 18th century still used at the post office (wrapping, wrapping with twine and wax seals)?  The introduction of standard packages, similar to those used in EMS, will relieve workers and speed up the processing procedure. <br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <i>Indeed, postal technologies in Russia are far from perfect.</i>  <i>As noted in the answer to question No. 10, the current financial condition of the Post of Russia does not allow the use of modern technology in its entirety.</i>  <i>As we noted earlier, the modernization of postal technologies is associated with a reboot of the entire industry and its economic model.</i> <br><br>  <font color="#e6e6e6">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</font> <br><br>  <b>Question 12.</b> It would be great to add to the ‚Äúwhere, to whom‚Äù fields and the optional ‚Äútelephone number‚Äù field. <br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <i>Good suggestion, thanks!</i>  <i>Be sure to take into account.</i> <br><br>  <font color="#e6e6e6">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</font> <br><br>  <b>Question 13.</b> Do you plan to replace the notifications in the form of paper notices, which can ‚Äúgo‚Äù for several days, to e-mail or SMS notifications? <br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <i>We agree that the mail in its work would be good to use advanced technologies, including e-mail and the capabilities of cellular networks.</i>  <i>However, there are a number of issues that in some cases complicate the application of these technologies.</i>  <i>Firstly, an e-mail or SMS message is not a means of guaranteed information delivery, and is not a means of documentary telecommunications.</i>  <i>Secondly, there are a huge number of regions where electronic services are still unavailable to regular mail clients.</i>  <i>Thirdly, there are separate groups of citizens who always prefer a paper notice to an electronic one.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>That is why the development model of Post of Russia implies diversification of postal services depending on the region and taking into account its needs and capabilities.</i> <br><br>  <font color="#e6e6e6">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</font> <br><br>  <b>Question 14.</b> When sending parcels, in connection with the monopoly of the Russian Post, the tariffs for shipping are limited to FAS, but despite this, Russian Post imposes additional paid services, such as pasting the box with a company stamp or checking the attachment.  Moreover, tariffs in different regions differ.  How correct is this? <br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <i>Imposing paid services regardless of the business of the enterprise is illegal and you have the right to refuse them.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>In your question you note the fact of the monopoly position of the Post of Russia.</i>  <i>I want to note that the new federal law ‚ÄúOn Postal Communication‚Äù, which will be considered by the State Duma during the spring session, provides for non-discriminatory access to the postal infrastructure.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Also in fairness, we note that the tariffs for postal services are set by the Federal Tariff Service.</i> <br><br>  <font color="#e6e6e6">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</font> <br><br>  <b>Question 15.</b> I, as the owner of an online store, take the cost of shipping goods by mail, including the commission for cash on delivery.  But as I was explained at the post office - the size of the commission depends on the specific department of the Russian Post.  And this amount of commission, I can not look at the site of the Russian Post - just by calling the branch where the package with the goods is sent.  Accordingly, it is not possible to accurately estimate the amount of commission to deduct from the cost of goods.  Will there ever appear a transparent and unified charging? <br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <i>Obviously, a single transparent pricing system for processing and forwarding mail items for legal entities should be developed and we will pay close attention to this, since our strategic task is to create an efficient distribution network based on the Post of Russia.</i> <br><br>  <font color="#e6e6e6">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</font> <br><br>  <b>Question 16.</b> Do you plan to remove the obstacles due to which some popular delivery services (for example, <abbr title="Uzel Pochtovoy Svyazi :)">UPS</abbr> ) still find it impossible to work with Russia? <br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <i>As far as we understand from your question, we are talking about the delivery of parcels by foreign commercial postal services to the regions of Russia.</i>  <i>We inform that out of 83 non-state postal service operators, only 23 render services outside of Moscow and St. Petersburg.</i>  <i>The rest prefer to work only in high-margin markets.</i>  <i>The new federal law ‚ÄúOn Postal Communication‚Äù will remove all restrictions on access to the mail infrastructure, and commercial operators, if they wish, will be able to deliver their parcels even to the most remote regions of Russia.</i> <br><br>  <font color="#e6e6e6">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</font> <br><br>  ¬ª <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/162095/">Answers Minister of Communications to the questions of users: part 1</a> <br>  (Informatization and Public Services) <br><br>  ¬ª <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/163331/">Answers Minister of Communications to the questions of users: Part 2</a> ( <abbr title="Free Software">STR</abbr> and <abbr title="National Software Platform">SPE</abbr> ) <br><br>  ¬ª <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18uTxBUlBShaLBBUOwE7XGxKd5AySVWoL9dxVbJ9oVxc/edit">Full list of questions</a> <br><br>  Happy New Year! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/164133/">https://habr.com/ru/post/164133/</a></p>
