      It is very nice that the document contains definitions of terms - this allows us to understand the views of the authors of the document on the defined concepts. <br><br><blockquote>  According to experts, as well as leading research organizations, including the National Research University Higher School of Economics, the Internet economy is an area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity in which infrastructure and network services are created (backbone communication networks, broadcasting, data transmission, communication services , paid Internet access services, superimposed content delivery and data transfer networks, data storage and processing centers, microelectronics, electronics, client devices and gadgets), software (software) (platform solutions and  Services, corporate software, business applications and services), client Internet services and applications (search engines, portals, digital media and entertainment, social networks, games, e-commerce, financial services, distance education, distance medicine), cross-platform solutions and technologies, including public sector platforms (Internet of things, OTT platforms, robotics, smart home, smart networks, etc.) <br></blockquote><br>  It's funny, but judging by the definition - all the necessary hardware for creating an Internet economy should arise from the air.  This is all the more amusing, as it becomes clear below that the creation of such an economy is unthinkable without creating not just breakthrough technologies (and of course setting up production), but should also be done by Russian companies as part of import substitution. <br><br><blockquote>  Few industries involved in the Internet are material production and economic sectors with varying degrees of involvement in the Internet economy: dependent on the consumption of network Internet services and electronic government services, the use of specialized and integrated infrastructure software using cross-platform solutions and technologies.  Experts include, in particular, the aerospace sector, the heavy, light and chemical industries, engineering and instrumentation, pharmaceuticals, energy, construction, agriculture and food industry, mining, forestry and fisheries. <br></blockquote><br>  Experts certainly know better, but I would not say that high technologies, including robotics and remote control, do not affect most of the listed industries.  And really - below the document the task of robotization.  However, the document resembles a puzzle assembled from several sets.  Below is another definition: <br><br><blockquote>  The Internet economy is an economic infrastructure, an ICT-based environment that combines various sectors of the Russian and world economy through the Internet, the foundation and key tool for the development of the economy as a whole. <br></blockquote><br>  I like this definition more. <br><br>  Objective of the project? <br><br>  The picture of ICT-future of Russia will be determined by several key technological factors and their various combinations in private life, society, business and the state: <br>  digital sovereignty, import substitution and information security; <br>  absolute connectivity of all territories and population, high speed of access; <br>  large amounts of data on people, organizations, territories, analytical models based on these data arrays; <br>  Internet of things: wearable devices, artificial intelligence (AI) and communication in household and industrial equipment, vehicles, nanoscalers and radio tags; <br>  biological and digital convergence: neural interfaces, chipping, cyber organs. <br><br>  All items, except the last, are constantly heard from high tribunes - and it would be strange if they did not appear in the document.  But the last point sounds very fantastic. <br><br><blockquote>  The main goal of the long-term Program for the development of the Russian part of the Internet and its related industries should be the creation of favorable conditions for the development of the Russian Internet economy - independent of external influences and competitive on a global scale.  And with its development - to improve the quality of life of citizens, to create a sustainable, high-performing, competitive and manageable economy. <br>  ... <br>  In the sphere of civil society, to ensure digital equality, digital public domain, increase the participation of civil society in state and regional governance, and also indirectly through the development of the Internet economy and the growth of the country's economy as a whole ‚Äî an increase in the quality of life of people: amenities and comfort of life, level income, accessibility and quality of various services, efficiency and productivity of life, independence, freedom and new opportunities for development, work, creativity, leisure, etc. <br></blockquote><br>  The first bell.  It is intended to implement various services and services that (including) will raise the level of income.  Opportunities for freelancing, remote diagnostics and more will naturally increase.  The incomes of those who create the Internet economy will naturally rise.  But there are also those who must consume all these services, ensuring the development of the business of those who create a new economy.  The development of companies largely depends on the availability of effective demand - which for our country depends much more on the dollar exchange rate than on the availability of services. <br><br>  For what period are the activities planned to be implemented within the framework of the Road Maps? <br><br><blockquote>  The present proposals for the Internet Development Program in Russia propose to determine the most effective ways of developing the country's economic sectors using the Internet for the next 10 years by combining the knowledge, views and opinions of representatives of leading Russian Internet companies, as well as companies most involved in the Internet. <br></blockquote><br>  Below, the terms are specified, and the production volumes and the amounts of export proceeds are announced. <br><br><blockquote> The implementation of tasks aimed at the development of the ICT industry is largely determined by the Government of the Russian Federation in the Strategy for Innovative Development of the Russian Federation for the period up to 2020, in the Forecast of the long-term socio-economic development of the Russian Federation for the period up to 2030, in the Strategy for the development of the information technology industry in Of the Russian Federation for 2014‚Äì2020 and for the perspective until 2025, in terms of activities (‚Äúroadmap‚Äù) ‚ÄúDevelopment of the information technology industry‚Äù, in the state program ‚ÄúInformation Society  (2011-2020) and other government documents. <br><br>  In December 2013, with a view to adopting measures by the executive authorities aimed at accelerating the development of the information technology industry in 2014‚Äì2018 and the implementation of the above Strategy, an action plan (‚Äúroadmap‚Äù) was approved by the Government of the Russian Federation dated December 30, 2013 No. 2602. information technology industries.  In accordance with the plan of measures, by 2018, the ratio of the growth rate of the IT industry to the growth rate of gross domestic product will increase threefold, the volume of production in the field of IT will reach 450 billion rubles and the volume of export of products from the IT industry will reach $ 9 billion. <br><br>  In 2014, in order to implement the Strategy for the development of the information technology industry in Russia, the Government of the Russian Federation No. 313 of April 15, 2014 approved the state program Information Society (2011-2020), which aims to improve the quality of life of citizens through the use of ICT.  In accordance with the program, by 2020, according to the information technology development index, Russia should be among the top 10 countries in the world. <br></blockquote><br>  The timing is certainly not long, but not small.  True, there are big doubts that during such a period there will be conditions for the implementation of all our plans.  But the promised tripling of the runway was fulfilled? <br><br>  Who should realize the new economy? <br><br><blockquote>  Performers of the program: <br>  Government bodies; <br>  Development institutions; <br>  Specialized project teams and organizations. <br></blockquote><br>  Already the second point is surprising - who are they?  Apparently the project teams will be subordinate to the IR.  But on the basis of whom these teams will be created?  Question.  After all, the use of firms and startups in this list is not meant <br><br><blockquote>  There is a fast and deep integration of telecommunications, network Internet infrastructure and software with Internet services, hardware and electronics, which are an integral part of the ICT industry. <br></blockquote><br>  A very interesting phrase of the document is about the integration of "telecommunications industries, network Internet infrastructure" with hardware.  I would say that on the contrary, everything is created or should be created on the basis of (fundamentally new) hardware.  anyway <br><br>  And then an interesting passage: <br><br><blockquote>  The issue of insufficient competitiveness of individual Russian, and in the past, Soviet companies and enterprises lies not only and not so much on the plane of openness-closeness, monopolization-de-monopolization, bureaucratization-de-bureaucratization of individual sectors and markets of the country or directly depends on the form of ownership. <br></blockquote><br>  This paragraph stands out from the whole document and it is not clear why it is needed - perhaps it is implied that successful projects can execute not only commercial structures. <br><br><blockquote>  The success of the Program for the development of the Russian part of the Internet and related sectors of the economy will be determined by the presence and coherence of four key elements of the socio-economic environment of the Internet economy, the most important resources for its growth: <br>  1) a sufficient amount of highly qualified and motivated human capital, which will work in Russia; <br>  2) highly competitive technologies and world-class technology projects, which largely depends on the availability of adequate human capital and corresponding state programs that support and subsidize them; <br>  3) sufficient financial resources for the commercialization and monetization of these technologies and projects, which can be done in the framework of targeted programs and development directions, as well as through financing programs for the development of the economy as a whole while monitoring its target use in investment projects of various industries, which will create a wave of demand in various industries and growth multiplier; <br>  4) effective demand, growing through several channels: access of Russian Internet companies to international markets (Southeast Asia, Latin America, Europe, etc.), increasing demand from Russian state and other companies, protecting the domestic market (automatically will increase domestic demand for Russian companies) and the development of a balanced sustainable economy as a whole due to the steady growth of various industries that can ensure a steady growth of domestic demand for the long term. <br></blockquote><br>  The first two paragraphs of the questions do not cause, but the rest ... The third point tells us that development will take place within the framework of state programs - development financing through domestic demand is not provided for - which conflicts with the declared goal of raising the total income of the population.  Apparently going to the real steps, the authors of the document have become more realistic.  The demand for services is envisaged in foreign markets, from state-owned companies, businesses.  Demand from the population is not provided!  The domestic market is closing - when declaring the creation of breakthrough technologies, the authors of the document are not sure that Russian companies will cope with the competition: <br><br><blockquote>  It is necessary to create preferences for Russian companies, protective measures for the Russian Internet economy and the economy as a whole, similar to those used in China and other countries. <br><br>  The size of Russia as a sales market, even within the framework of the Customs Union, is small compared to the main technological competitors (USA, China, EU, India), producing products oriented to many times more capacious markets.  This extends the payback period of projects, reduces the potential size and competitiveness of Russian goods and projects on a global scale and in the domestic market.  To get rid of this shortcoming, Russian business must actively work in international markets, including in the initial stages of projects, including in the countries of Southeast Asia, Latin America, etc. <br></blockquote><br>  Further, the project considers the available documents aimed "at the innovative development of the ICT industry" <br><br>  Government support for the domestic ICT industry relies on the country's long-term development forecast, compiled by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia in March 2013.  The relevant document, entitled ‚ÄúForecast of the long-term socio-economic development of the Russian Federation for the period up to 2030‚Äù, outlined 10 key priority trends in scientific and technological development.  Among the most socially significant are mentioned: <br>  the development of new principles of organization of calculations, which will increase the maximum clock frequency of the computer by <strong>three to five orders of magnitude</strong> ; <br>  development of machine learning systems, computer networks with terabit speeds and supercomputer computing; <br>  cloud technology development; <br>  growth in the share of mobile devices: tablets, smartphones, etc .; <br>  the evolution of the Internet, involving the development of distributed intelligent systems, smart or semantic networks. <br><br><br>  If you look at the source document, the phrase on the clock frequency looks a little different. <br><br><blockquote>  development of research in the field of computing organization, creation of computing architectures built on new paradigms, including neuro, bio, optical, quantum, self-synchronization, recurrence, which will increase the maximum clock frequency of the optical computer to 10 <sup>12</sup> -10 <sup>14</sup> Hz (3-5 orders of magnitude higher than existing electronic analogs); <br></blockquote><br>  But back to the project. <br><br><blockquote>  In accordance with this document, the Government of the Russian Federation sets the following main goals for the development of the information technology industry for 2014‚Äì2025: <br>  1) The development of information technology to the full-fledged industry of the Russian economy, creating high-performance jobs and ensuring the production of high-tech and competitive products; <br></blockquote><br>  That is, the Government of the Russian Federation does not consider the IT field to be a full-fledged sector of the economy.  But the authors of the document do not agree with this: <br><br><blockquote>  The share of the Russian ICT industry has significantly increased in the structure of the economy and has become strategic. <br></blockquote><br>  Freudian reservation: ‚ÄúRussian share‚Äù. <br><br>  What should be done in accordance with the available documents? <br><blockquote>  To achieve the goal, the experts assume the obligatory solution of the following tasks: <br>  1) The development of human capital, including through the development of specialized education and promotion of the professions of the industry; <br>  2) Improving the institutional environment for companies in Russia and reducing administrative barriers; <br>  3) <strong>Export support</strong> and globalization of the industry; <br>  4) Development of research in the field of information technology and related fields in Russia; <br>  5) Development of small business support mechanisms, including accelerators, business incubators, technology parks and institutions necessary to improve the investment climate; <br>  6) Improving the literacy of the population in the field of information technology; <br>  7) Normalization of statistical observation in the industry; <br>  8) Improving the interaction of government bodies that determine the state policy in the field of information technology with industry associations, clusters, platforms and other associations; <br>  9) <strong>Creating conditions for the development of global leaders in the field of information technologies in order to eliminate the imbalances in the industry and create additional opportunities for redemption of shares in the authorized capital of companies in the information technology industry by Russian investors</strong> by expanding the pool of large companies in the information technology industry in Russia through market mechanisms; <br>  10) Further deep informatization of the most important sectors of the Russian economy, including the public sector; <br>  11) <strong>Stimulating the development of domestic production by ordering the state and companies with state participation;</strong> <br>  12) Ensuring information security; <br>  13) <strong>Large-scale opening of state databases</strong> ; <br>  14) E-commerce infrastructure development; <br>  15) The development of electronic documents; <br>  16) Development of information processing and storage centers; <br>  17) Development of broadband access (BBA) on the Internet. <br></blockquote><br>  Again reliance on exports, and not on domestic development.  Order by state-owned companies.  But then - the song: "Creating conditions for the development of global leaders in the field of IT in order to ... create opportunities for redemption of shares in the authorized capital of companies in the industry ... by Russian investors."  An interesting phrase, are we going to improve the working conditions of the existing industry leaders and buy back shares in their capital?  Against this background, the opening of public databases for public access looks like a trifle. <br><br>  However, ‚Äúexperts note that in practice, the adopted documents currently do not work.  This is due to the fact that: the actions of state customers are not coordinated, the elimination of conflicts between goals and methods declared in a number of documents is required, a number of provisions are not clearly defined, the actions of state bodies in the development of ICT technologies and their integration into various sectors of the economy are not coordinated , and in some cases contradictory.  Despite the declaration of large-scale ideas and projects, in some cases, program activities are focused on solving particular problems ... A long-term program is required to be adopted, the goal of which is to create an Internet economy in Russia based on the development of the ICT industry in all sectors. ‚Äù <br><br>  Further, the document proceeds to more specific things, rightly noting that ‚ÄúThe most important component of the Program‚Äôs success is the coherence of the projects being implemented, the possibility of their integration, the provision of ICT and Internet infrastructures of various sectors of the economy, not to mention the infrastructures of individual industries.‚Äù <br><br><blockquote>  2) The basis and tool for creating such a socio-economic system of the world and national economy will be a high-tech and highly intelligent economy based on knowledge, high qualification and level of human resources development (education and culture) and widespread use of ICT at all levels of government and business management and in the development of society; <br>  4) For citizens, the level and dynamics of movement towards the new economy will be determined by a high and growing level of development and life satisfaction (quality of life of the population). <br></blockquote><br>  That is, the new economy will be used more by citizens with a high level of development and a greater level of life satisfaction? <br><br><blockquote>  Among the possible obstacles and limitations to moving to a new economy in Russia, experts highlighted the main current and potential problems: <br>  3) The limited and accelerated growth of consumption of natural resources, including energy and food, due to the accelerated growth of the population of the Earth and economic growth in emerging markets.  This can lead to a struggle for raw materials, and on the other hand, to a large-scale switch to alternative resources and energy sources (including due to increased production efficiency). <br></blockquote><br>  Again a strange thesis.  Naturally, let's say the exhaustion of oil sources will put an end to many things, but in theory the new economy is supposed to remove it from the vicious circle tied to exhaustible natural resources?  Otherwise, it will be a feast during the plague. <br><br><blockquote>  4) Deterioration of the human environment, including the ecology in general, especially in large cities, overcrowding and reduced quality of life in certain regions, following this over-expenditure and local budget deficit. <br></blockquote><br>  Ecology is definitely important for satisfaction with life, but this factor is unlikely to affect the level of information - rather the opposite - accelerated consumption of resources will raise the standard of living (temporarily), which will lead to an increase in demand and so on.  However, below the ecology is linked to the attraction and retention of specialists in Russia <br><br><blockquote>  To attract and retain highly qualified people in Russia, a highly developed system and material base of science and education, a high level of household security, a decent income and an adequate level of material support, comfortable living conditions: developed medicine, healthcare, social security, good living conditions, and a favorable living environment are required: ecology and nature. <br></blockquote><br>  It is hard to argue, but in practice there are no positive trends in the same education - rather, on the contrary, there is a drop in real income and an increase in paper load. <br><br><blockquote>  Russia's share in the structure of world venture financing is still very small in absolute terms, which does not allow the industry to develop dynamically on an equal footing with other countries.  Venture financing in Russia is not large and relative indicators.  But this can be offset by large-scale participation of the state and large corporations. <br></blockquote><br>  The reasons leading to a low level of venture financing have been repeatedly discussed on the Megamind.  But instead of forming an economy aimed at introducing innovations (we recall, this is the goal of creating a new economy) again, they want to sign large companies to buy unnecessary.  Will this make sense? <br><br>  Not without traditional complaints: <br><br><blockquote>  The initial natural and geographical conditions in a number of industrial regions of Russia are losing in comparison with Europe, China and the USA.  This is reflected in the high costs of electricity, construction of housing and transport infrastructure. <br><br>  In Russia, many regulatory conditions are discriminatory against Russian companies.  Foreign companies are not only exempt from VAT on cross-border supplies of products and services to Russia, but also do not pay, for example, the income tax on the actual place of business - in Russia.  Russian Internet companies unjustifiably do not fall under the preferential rate of fees to insurance funds of 14%, established in Russia for IT companies.  Equal taxation in Russia of foreign Internet companies can become a tool to protect domestic producers, compensate for the reduction in the rate of insurance premiums for Russian Internet companies, and become a source of state budget revenues. <br></blockquote><br>  What should the internet economy look like? <br><br><blockquote>  The development of the Internet economy defines a number of technological trends that create qualitatively new means of production and communications: <br>  1) A smart or intelligent enterprise operating on the basis of the integration of automated control systems (ACS) for production and business processes, the interaction of devices and devices, information analysis and decision-making systems; <br> 2)     , ,   -  .     , ,    ; <br> 3)              (, , ,   .),       ,    . -        ,    ,        ,        ,     ,     ; <br> 4)     , , ,   ,   ,  ,      ; <br> 5)   -,  , ,         ; <br> 6)  ,       :   ,           ,   ,        -   ¬´ ¬ª; <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">7) Horizontal communication and relationship systems in business, government and society based on Internet technologies, creating flexible labor, social, inter-sectoral and interstate groups and communities that transform all management systems and socio-economic relations; </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">8) The rapid emergence of numerous new technologies and solutions (Big Data (Big Data), Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, etc.), born at the junction of various technological platforms, as well as the synergy of services that are connected by the Internet, which radically change the ways of organizing production consumption and leisure.</font></font><br></blockquote><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Then the experts decided to look into the future ... </font></font><br><br><blockquote>  The state will regulate legislation on data protection, control systems that prevent data hacking, methods of encryption, specialized systems of protection and protection against targeted attacks on data and devices. <br><br>  Large data on citizens will be accumulated by state structures and private companies that will organize their exchange and sale. <br></blockquote><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> To be continued! </font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295760/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295760/</a></p>
