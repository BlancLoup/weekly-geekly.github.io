Do we, IB security workers, have their own fundamental laws?  Yes there is!  And in this article we will talk about them. </p><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  I must say that many readers will comment;  because many laws were known long before I heard them from certain individuals ... Well, in this case, I refer to <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2597%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD_%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0">the Stigler's Law</a> : <em>"No scientific discovery is called after its original discoverer"</em> . </p><br><h2 id="zakon-indyukova">  Indyukov's law </h2><br><blockquote>  <strong>The more time has passed since the last serious security incident, the greater the likelihood of hacking the system.</strong> </blockquote><p>  I first heard this law from one system administrator of a very large bank ... <br>  That incident went through, they stole XX million rubles, they gave everyone their ass, they changed the passwords, ordered cool IB systems (in all spheres! On all fronts! ...).  Calm down ... <br>  Time passes, people relax ... And again 50-year-old aunts put 12345 password on the system or write it on paper and attach it to the monitor in orbit ... Again, many servers are clumsily set up on the network ... what kind of coffee the CEO drank ... And again ... And again ... And again ... Until something serious happened again ... </p><br><p>  From the side it seems to be nonsense, but these are the realities of many, many large organizations, <em>with a prevailing bureaucratic component</em> .  People relax.  People in large bureaucratic offices behave like little boys, who in March are walking with their heads bare and without a scarf. <br>  Boys catch a cold, snot and lie down with the flu or cold.  Having recovered, they put on scarves and hats, but a year later everything repeats again. </p><br><p>  I do not know how to defend myself from the <em>Law of Indyukov</em> .  Have an opinion?  - write in the comments. </p><br><h2 id="zakon-mitnika">  Mitnick's Law </h2><br><blockquote>  <strong>Even turned off the computer can be hacked</strong> </blockquote><p>  This is a famous quote from the book of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA,_%25D0%259A%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD">Kevin Mitnik. The</a> <a href="http://adblog.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/iskusstvo_obmana.pdf">Art of Deception</a> . <br>  Do not think that you are protected.  Always, even in the <em>"obvious way of 100% protection"</em> you can find a flaw. <br>  Shut down the computer can be turned on.  Hands  Physically clicking on power.  However, in order to <em>hack it</em> , you can not turn it on, you can just steal it, or steal a part of the computer (hard disk). </p><br><h2 id="zakon-sklyarova">  Sklyarov's law </h2><br><blockquote>  <strong>If the <em>cost of</em> hacking object A is <em>greater than the benefits</em> of hacking object A, then the object will not be hacked</strong> </blockquote><p>  I heard the law from the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_Technologies">Positive Technologes</a> employee, Dmitry Sklyarov.  The law is trivial and obvious, but ... looking at some, we will not point the finger at individuals who make strategic decisions in certain companies, I understand that Sklyarov's law is not known to everyone.  Or it is severely ignored.  They protect a hundred rubles, setting up an expensive safe ... Or, on the contrary, really interesting and valuable information is not protected at all. </p><br><p>  Business must weigh the <em>risks</em> .  Understand the value of this or that protected information and create (or buy) information security systems that provide potential hackers with more than a possible potential <em>benefit</em> for hacking. </p><br><p>  The law has nuances: </p><br><ol><li>  The cost of hacking can fall sharply (for example, a new vulnerability has appeared or you have implemented an insider in the company's staff) </li><li>  You can estimate the cost of hacking and / or the cost of profit <em>inadequately</em> . </li><li>  Not everything can be measured in money and hackers are not always guided by monetary motives. </li></ol><br><h2 id="zakon-batenyova">  Law Bateniova </h2><br><p>  Having spoken about Sklyarov's law, we turn to the law formulated by <em>Alexander Batenyov</em> ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group-IB">Group-IB</a> ). </p><br><blockquote>  Suppose the conditions are true <br><ol><li>  There are various publicly known objects: A and B </li><li>  The cost of hacking A is <em>more than the</em> cost of hacking B </li><li>  The benefits of hacking A <em>less</em> from hacking B <br>  Law Batenova: <br>  <strong>Object A will not be hacked until Object B is hacked.</strong> </li></ol><br></blockquote><p>  The law seems incredibly obvious (in principle, the way it is!) However, many and many business representatives are absolutely convinced that if they are not touched, they are therefore protected.  Ahhh !!!  This is not true!!!  For example, if the RB of your bank is not cracked by hackers, then this only means that Sberbank and VTB, as well as smaller, but ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù banks, have not yet fully resolved all their security problems.  They are just "tastier" than you!  It's like a <a href="https://lurkmirror.ml/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B5%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%2594%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BE">joke about the Elusive Joe</a> .  When you need someone, you may be hacked easily and quickly.  Business, and business, do you need this? </p><br><p>  It is the <em>Law of Bateniov</em> "protects" various <em>infrastructures</em> .  Hackers simply can not <em>benefit</em> from hacking nuclear power plants, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D1%258D%25D0%25BD">Shinkansen</a> , and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2586_%25D0%25A4%25D1%2591%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580">candle factories</a> ... </p><br><p>  This law was Alexander's answer to my <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/253045/">question about the relevance of steganography</a> .  In his opinion, steganography is <em>‚Äúof course cool,‚Äù</em> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/group-ib/blog/323996/">but there are much simpler ways to achieve the same results</a> ... But when <em>‚Äúthe world grows wiser</em> ,‚Äù then <em>‚Äústeganography and stegoanalyst will become extremely relevant</em> . <em>‚Äù</em>  Well, then you can not argue.  Apparently the way it is.  It‚Äôs not time for my favorite steganography ... Eh ... </p><br><h2 id="zakon-deykstry">  Dijkstra's Law </h2><br><blockquote>  <strong>The deeper the stack of protocols (technologies used), the more vulnerable the system</strong> </blockquote><p>  In other words, the more complex and confusing the system, the easier it is to hack it. </p><br><p>  Initially, Edsger Vibe Dijkstra formulated his law in relation to <em>understanding the</em> system as a whole, <br>  bearing in mind that the times will come soon enough when the programmer will not understand all the details <br>  the processes occurring in computing ... In principle, the way it turned out.  Why are there details <br>  unfortunately, and <em>in general,</em> not all programmers know how a computer works: (... </p><br><p>  This is sad.  Loss of control over the <em>integrity of perception of reality</em> makes many and many elements of a <em>really large system</em> look like black boxes or, at best, like <em>very gray</em> boxes.  Even if the functionality of each mailbox is known to one or another developer and each of them can <em>guarantee</em> (I wonder what?) The safety of <em>"one's own beds"</em> , this does not mean at all that the system consisting of safe elements is itself safe.  The whole is not the sum of its parts. </p><br><p>  Dijkstra's law is not just an inevitable evil.  This law forces us to change the <em>paradigm of</em> our attitude to information security.  Without hesitation, we, the security guards, simply "stole" the paradigm from the military and tried to build <strong>strict</strong> systems that are completely, completely protected.  Even in the mathematical sense, they tried to invent something stern ... Well, remember <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C_%25D0%2591%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0_%25E2%2580%2594_%25D0%259B%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D1%258B">the Bella-Lapadule model</a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biba_Model">the Beeba</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark%25E2%2580%2593Wilson_model">model</a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark%25E2%2580%2593Wilson_model">the Clark-Wilson</a> <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C_%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25A0%25D1%2583%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25A3%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0">model</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C_%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25A0%25D1%2583%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25A3%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0">the Harrison-Ruzzo-Ulman model,</a> and so on.  In the framework of this classic paradigm, if a user is broken, then this is not a problem of IB systems, this is a problem of curved personnel, unreliable passwords and social engineering! .. </p><br><p>  But the world is changing and the systems become very large.  They begin to live their own lives.  You can imagine an organization with more than 1500 different DBMSs on the internal network!  Can you imagine THIS!? .. That's how you can manage all this and be confident in security?! .. </p><br><p>  What to do?  I think the only way out is to switch from <em>passive</em> to <em>active</em> systems.  Those.  work "ahead of the curve".  The modern criminal cyber world no longer consists of ingenious lone hackers.  This is a whole system.  Need to study and explore this system.  I do not urge to abandon the "classic" antivirus solutions, DLP, tokens, SFTP, etc.  Not!  I simply urge to declare these measures <strong>insufficient by</strong> virtue <em>of the Dijkstra Act</em> . </p><br><p>  As well as the fight against terrorism is not only checking bags at airports and train stations, but also in the work of special services;  likewise, in the world of information security, <em>active</em> actions need to be launched not only when the information security incident has already occurred.  It is necessary to work regularly and systematically in this direction, creating <em>active</em> "solutions" in information security. </p><br>
<h2 id="zakon-ashmanova-masalovicha">  Ashmanov-Masalovich law </h2><br><blockquote>  <strong>The man is also subject to hacking.</strong>  <strong>Perhaps it is the person who needs to be protected first.</strong> </blockquote><p>  After hearing the wonderful lectures of Igor Ashmanov and Andrei Masalovich, I could not write about this fundamental law.  Who has not yet seen ‚Äú <a href="http://live.digitaloctober.ru/embed/2990">Big data in social networks: special NSA surveillance is not required for you</a> ‚Äù and ‚Äú <a href="http://live.digitaloctober.ru/embed/2999">Life after Snowden. Modern Internet intelligence tools</a> ‚Äù - urgently eliminate gaps. </p><br><p>  Initially, it all grew out of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25BD%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0">information wars</a> .  Honestly, there was a great temptation to cheat anything out of politics ... But ... the habr rules forbid it.  Therefore, I will give an example from the business field: </p><br><blockquote>  <em>In December 2014, Sberbank of Russia experienced an unprecedented attack on its customers.</em>  <em>They got hundreds</em> <em><br></em>  <em>thousands of SMS with a warning that Visa cards issued by Sberbank will no longer be serviced.</em>  <em>There were also stuffing in social networks: it was said that Sberbank faced liquidity problems and was unable to issue money.</em>  <em>Clients, instantly oriented, ran to withdraw their deposits.</em>  <em>About 300 billion rubles.</em>  <em>- this was the price of a well-planned information attack, the traces of which, according to representatives of the Bank of Russia, led to Ukrainian Internet resources.</em>  <em>And again, the business remembered the security post factum, having started an investigation into the incident.</em> <br>  <strong>Alexey Lukatsky</strong> .  <a href="http://bis-expert.ru/articles/50585">IB for business: How to sell stealth</a> </blockquote><p>  In general, any social engineering is a consequence <em>of the Ashmanov-Masalovich Law</em> . </p><br><h2 id="zakon-berezina">  Berezina law </h2><br><blockquote>  <strong>Until the thunder clap, business will not give money to the IB</strong> </blockquote><p>  The law is known to all.  And constantly talking about it.  And no one can do anything.  Well, do not want a business to spend money on IB.  And all because the IB does not bring profit and it is very mysteriously and incomprehensibly reduces costs.  But if you dig a hole not with a spoon but with a shovel, then everything is clear!  We buy a shovel, throw out spoons!  And with information security is not clear.  Berezin believes that it will be <strong>forever</strong> .  Personally, I completely agree with him.  And you? </p><br><p>  Since  <a href="http://elvis.ru/upload/iblock/f45/f451558e46997fcd21fb49c9c072611f.pdf">this article is the</a> first thing that jumped out of my search engine, and then we will call this law in honor of A.

Just before the advent of <strong>open</strong> work, these tasks were solved by the mathematicians of the leading special services and their work was classified ...
