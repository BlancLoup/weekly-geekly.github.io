We compete and want to win in all areas of our lives.  And the more we win, the more significant our life becomes, the brighter we live, the higher our social status and the more we earn.  We collect praise, encouragement, recognition and other "medals" all our conscious and not very life in order to feel our importance and earn a little on it.  And we will talk about one of these "medals" - the certificate "1C: Compatible!". <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I think you will decide for yourself why this certificate is for you.  You may need it for: <br><ul><li>  receiving from 1C company additional confirmation that your product works as it should; </li></ul><br><ul><li>  the ability to ‚Äúlight up‚Äù on the 1C website in the ‚ÄúNews‚Äù section and in the catalog of products that received a certificate, which is an excellent advertisement for you; </li></ul><br><ul><li>  getting your company new partnership opportunities with a significant number of 1C franchisees. </li></ul><br>  That is, you need it more to increase the chance that a potential buyer will choose you. <br>  Given that 1C products are very popular in Russia and the CIS countries, many 1C users will be able to see information about the solutions that received this certificate.  Your product might be on this list.  So why not get this certificate, and besides, also for free? <br>  Certifications are subject to software products, computers and plug-in equipment. <br>  In our article we will deal with the certification of a software product, the type of which is ‚Äúadditions to configurations, expanding their capabilities and developed in the 1C: Enterprise environment. <br><br>  So, what you need to get a certificate:

Send a request to hline@1c.ru.</b>  In this application you specify: <br>  - the category in which you want to certify your ‚Äúreplicable technological solution‚Äù; <br>  - how it will be delivered; <br>  - for what typical configurations it can be used. <br>  <a href="http://www.legalpo.info/competit/1c/corporate">Here</a> you can better understand how to correctly answer these questions. <br><br>  <b>3. Print and fill <a href="http://www.1c.ru/rus/products/1c/predpr/compat/soft/request.htm">out this</a> application here.</b>  You must sign the completed application, stamp the company stamp on it and fax it to (495) 681-44-07.  Just in case, a scan of the application can be enclosed in a letter (Section 2).  Send the original application with the delivery by courier. <br><br>  <b>4. Write a brief annotation containing:</b> <br>  - the name of the product, by whom it is developed, in what category of certification is presented (for add-ons - indicate the addition to which configuration it is) <br>  - to which industry the product belongs - a list of industries can be found on the website in <a href="http://www.1c.ru/rus/products/1c/predpr/compat/soft/request.htm">this section</a> ; <br>  - what the product is for; <br>  - additional features; <br>  - for the category of various ways of interaction and exchange: specify the way of interaction and briefly describe how the interaction is implemented; <br>  - for the category of certification configuration and additions: indicate whether the configuration is original or developed on the basis of a typical one (which one); <br>  - which platform and which components (Main delivery) 1C: Enterprises are necessary for the work of the program; <br>  - when using protection, indicate what the program is protected with and that the product has fragments that cannot be changed by the user; <br>  - where you can get additional information about the product: phone numbers, addresses, e-mail, a link to the page of the web site, which contains detailed information about the product. <br><br>  Annotation text must be written in accordance with the rules of the Russian language, contain no grammatical errors, be understandable to the user and not exceed one page of A5 text.  Examples of annotations can be seen <a href="http://www.1c.ru/news/inflist.jsp">here</a> in the form of certification letters. <br><br>  <b>5. To register the name of the developer in accordance with the ‚ÄúSchedule of registration of the names of the developers of configurations‚Äù.</b>  It is assumed that you have access to the <a href="http://partners.v8.1c.ru/index.jsp%3FparentID%3D27">section</a> that describes this procedure.  But if you do not have access there, request the necessary information from the representative of 1C assigned to you. <br><br>  You must send a letter compiled according to the described rules to v8@1c.ru.  A printed and signed version sent by fax (495) 681-78-08. <br><br>  <b>6. Prepare the product for shipment according to <a href="http://www.1c.ru/rus/products/1c/predpr/compat/soft/requirements.htm">these</a> rules.</b> <br><br>  <b>7. Send the product for certification.</b>  You need to send the following set: distribution kit, documentation, abstract (clause 4), application scan (clause 3) just in case and a scan of the ‚ÄúRegister Developer Name‚Äù document (clause 5). <br><br>  There are two ways: <br><ol><li>  sending by courier to the address: Moscow, st.  Seleznevskaya, 21 in the technical support department of the company "1C"; </li><li>  put the whole package on the ftp-server provided by 1C, what they should ask.  Access is valid for 30 days, but I guess you should not pull. </li></ol><br>  The initial dispatch requires the first option with a courier, because if something can be put on an FTP server, then documents such as ‚ÄúRegistration of the name of the developer‚Äù and ‚ÄúApplication for certification‚Äù must have a signature and seal, which involves sending the originals by courier. <br><br>  Therefore, we write the whole kit to disk, attach documentation and send it by courier. <br><br>  In the future, if you are required to correct / add something, then the corrected can be uploaded to FTP. <br><br>  If your product is checked and no errors are found in it, you will receive a letter with information about where to get your long-awaited certificate and stickers.  We took him here: Moscow, st.  Seleznevskaya 21, entrance from the Multimedia store, 2nd floor.  There will be a manager sitting there;  should ask the person supervising the certification of your product.  Documents, such as a power of attorney or even a passport, do not need, will give a "honest word". <br><br>  Good luck! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140995/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140995/</a></p>
