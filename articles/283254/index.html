One of these "chips" is a one-click payment.  About this - in the new issue of a series of copyright articles "9 secrets of online payments" from <a href="http://payonline.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dwebpayments-main">PayOnline</a> . <br><br>  One-click payments are a modern payment tool that allows buyers to pay for goods using a bank card without entering full payment details.  One-click payment is available only to authorized users of the online store - the client registers on the site and enters the full details of the bank card when making the first purchase.  To make subsequent purchases, he will need to enter only the CVC / CVV code - the last three digits on the back of the bank card, click the "Pay" button and go through 3-D Secure authorization.  In some cases, it is possible to implement without entering the CVC / CVV code, but with the help of only one payment button. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/payonline/blog/275101/">Part 1.

The buyer must be informed about this option and the convenience of its use.  The Russians‚Äôs confidence in online payments is growing, and if at first they were surprised at such innovations (‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt write my data, how could I get paid?!‚Äù), Now this is exactly what is expected of the store.

      The main advantage of a one-click payment is to reduce the payment procedures to a few seconds.  And the speed of shopping is one of the main factors for the transition of commerce from shopping centers to the global global network. <br><br><h3>  Who should pay special attention to one-click payments? </h3><br><ul><li>  This tool is in demand among online stores that are actively working with the customer base, attracting customers to make repeated purchases.  If a person makes purchases on your website on an ongoing basis, it will be much more convenient for him to enter the bank card details once at the first purchase, and as a result simply confirm the fact of payment by pressing a single button.  Among such services are sellers of goods of regular demand, utility companies, sellers of digital content (books, films, software, and music), service providers of Internet access, mobile communications, social networks, and online games. </li><li>  This tool is needed for those who care about the maximum simplification of the process of making a purchase.  If the user is a novice, it will be much easier for him to make purchases when the number of fields to be filled is reduced to just 1-2.  For an advanced regular user, ‚Äúone-click‚Äù payment is a significant reduction in the time it takes to place an order, which means another plus in the ‚Äúkarma‚Äù of the online store that has implemented this functionality. </li><li>  Also, ‚Äúone-click‚Äù payment is a real help for organizing ‚Äúimpulse purchases‚Äù.  This can be compared with the process of shopping in a supermarket, when, in addition to products from the shopping list, some pleasant trifle comes across.  It is worth extending a hand - and it already lies in the basket!  The same thing happens in the online store.  Even if the user has already placed an order, after him you can offer related products (with the tag ‚Äúyou may also be interested‚Äù), for the purchase of which it is enough to click once on the ‚ÄúPay‚Äù button. </li></ul><br>  Payment "one click" gives the user the feeling that they are waiting for him on the site, because when he comes there, everything is ready for making a purchase.  The service seems to be more friendly, becoming ‚Äúyours‚Äù.  This greatly increases the level of customer loyalty. <br><br>  According to the experience of PayOnline, the implementation of one-click payments on customer sites of the relevant type of business results in a 5-15% increase in payment traffic on bank cards.  At the same time, the security level of payments remains at the same high level as with standard payment by credit card through filling out a payment form. <br><br>  One example of a successful implementation is the online service for buying books <a href="http://www.litres.ru/">Liters</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c27/b44/68f/c27b4468fe3c453880112583f2203646.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Yevgeny Lisovsky, Director of Marketing of the liters service, told about the experience of connecting payments ‚Äúin one click‚Äù. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúOne of the most important areas of the category of Quick Wins, for which we in Lithuania began in 2011, was the optimization of payment systems.  It is worth noting that this process is still ongoing, because much has changed in the past four years, and there is always something to optimize. <br><br>  The most important block in optimization is the binding of means of payment to the account.  The ideal scenario is when payment from an associated payment medium occurs in one click, without entering any additional data.  In this case, the conversion of repeat purchases increases significantly. <br><br>  And in 2011 and now plastic cards dominate, so we first implemented the PayOnline card binding scheme.  At that time, few providers could process the linked card without taking the client from the merchant's site by token (token) without going to the site of the processing company.  We managed to achieve that more than 30% of clients paying with a card pay with an attached card.  Of course, customers highly appreciate this functionality, since it allows you to significantly reduce the purchase process at a time when you want to start reading a book here and now. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  The next issue of PayOnline's ‚Äú9 Secrets of Online Payments‚Äù will be about how payments are verified, how frauds are revealed.  We will talk about the operation of the fraud monitoring system, which allows you to ensure the security of your online business against financial fraud.
