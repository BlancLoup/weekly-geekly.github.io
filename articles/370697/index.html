The uprising of nanorobots began in RUSNANO.  Breaking the protection and disabling the security alarm, they left the research reactors, and then the building of the institute.  Some time later, other research institutes reported similar events.  Protection Sveglogorsky Research Institute attempted to stop the fugitives, using nerve gas.  When this did not help, and millions of nanorobots broke out into the courtyard of the institute, Junior Lieutenant Ivashchuk poured a pad in front of the gate with kerosene and set fire to it - all nanorobots were destroyed.  Some time later, the institute‚Äôs leaders began to receive text messages, which reported that in retaliation for the burning of hundreds of millions of comrades, nanorobots declared jihad to humanity.  Of course, these messages were taken as a joke and sent to the investigating authorities a request to catch the prankster.  It soon became clear that the telephone company‚Äôs servers had been hacked, and sms were sent by an unknown hacker.  A few months later, this mysterious story had to be remembered by other, much more serious, people in the Russian General Staff. <br><br>  02. 08. 2020. The problem looked like a bad year.  First, the wheat withered in the fields, the crops of legumes and rye died after the wheat, and then it went on and on.  They came to their senses when only transgenic vegetables remained in the fields, which, although they grew excellent, turned out to be completely inedible.  Worse, reports began to appear about the transition of transgenic vegetables to neighboring fields and fields.  Farmers massively refused to go out into the fields and tried to sidestep their own gardens.  Food prices are rapidly creeping up ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  05. 08. 2020. A special commission consisting of the country's best soil scientists and programmers established artificial causes of ‚Äúcrop failure‚Äù: nanorobots incredibly bred on the fields of the country, which destroyed the root system of agricultural crops, however, they did not stop there - they managed to reprogram GMOs, subordinating their own will and awakening the beginnings of pseudo-intelligence  The first showed aggression corn.  There were victims.  The situation is rapidly heating up.  There were no plans that anticipated such events in any archives and special funds, and therefore it was necessary to make independent decisions quickly.  Twelve brigades of the Giant Human-like Robots were sent to the battlefields, which had only recently been agricultural.

      09. 09. 2020. As it turned out, the army does not have the means to effectively counter such a sophisticated opponent.  Bullets, grenades and artillery are completely ineffective against wheat and garlic.  To burn the fields of the homeland with napalm, or, all the more, to use atomic weapons meant to lose the fertile layer and starve entire regions.  Therefore, the decision to send Giant Humanoid Robots into battle seemed the most logical.  The first fell corn.  For her, radishes, turnips and melons.  Lentils and tomatoes lasted a little longer.  Within a month, the fields were completely cleaned.  Vegetables trampled into the soil, grass burned from flame throwers.  However, everyone understood that this victory is still far away.  Nanorobots perfectly crush only on a perfectly flat and solid surface.  Attempts to trample them with the help of a GCHR or crush them with tank tracks led only to tramping deeper into the ground.  The nanorobots were invulnerable, which meant that hopes for the revival of agriculture were melting.  Together with the hopes melted and stocks in the bins of the homeland.  Panic was born in the country. <br><br>  11. 09. 2020. Meanwhile, the high-tech troops of Roskomnadzor entered the game. <br>  A team of computer security experts has come up with a bold hypothesis that a huge mass of bio-robots cannot make such complex and well-coordinated decisions on their own.  In the laboratory, they could (and at best) line up in chains and somehow move in the indicated direction.  There was no question of any self-replication, tactics of guerrilla warfare, not to mention the reprogramming of biological organisms.  The conclusion was self-evident: Iskin led the nanorobots!  12 minutes 32 seconds after the crew‚Äôs report lay down on the table to the commander-in-chief, the strategic bombers of the VKS flew into the sky ... <br><br>  After 3 hours and 48 minutes there was not a single data center in the country.  All Data Processing Centers and other Supercomputers have been destroyed.  Fire crews worked in the field.  Firefighters tried to minimize collateral damage and prevent flame spread to other civilian objects.  The decision was right - in the blink of an eye, nanorobots turned into brainless trash.  The price of victory was great.  The harvest was lost.  All research has been stopped indefinitely.  Communication worked intermittently.  Banks are closed.  The damage was enormous: numbers in the hundreds of billions of dollars were called.  Humanitarian aid began to flow into the country.  But even in this most difficult moment for the fatherland, there were inspections of all the research institutes that had any relation to the work with Iskin.  Fortunately, there were not very many.  And with a suitable technical base (or even more so the data center) and not one at all.  The investigation was at an impasse.  At that time, the existence of the Artificial Mind was indirectly confirmed by the results of the attack of the videoconferencing system, the question arose - where the hell did it take?  And this seemingly simple question prevented a lot of people from sleeping.  How was the enemy able to overcome multi-level government Internet protection?  In the case entered counterintelligence.  Logs in the servers of a certain provider showed that several months ago, just before the revolt of the nanorobots, a huge data packet was uploaded to one of the data centers.  These data were intended for further processing, and the customer was an astronomical observatory.  The investigative response team sent to the observatory found that the observatory personnel had no idea about any order or data packet transmitted to the data center.  Even more strange was the fact that the data were not transferred to the observatory from another server.  A disappointing conclusion was suggested: they were obtained using astronomical instruments, that is, the largest radio telescope in southern Russia.  And this in turn meant that humanity would have to deal with a developed alien civilization, possibly many times superior to ours in the level of technology development. <br><br>  19. 09. 2020. The hypothesis was soon confirmed by logs from the control computer.  It was found that the transfer was carried out with the nearest star to us - Proxima Centauri.  It was decided not to wait for the next gear and act on the lead.  The initial plan was to launch a space marines battalion into space.  At an emergency meeting, the UN Security Council decided to fully promote the project of a preemptive strike.  Two representatives of the UN mission, agents Hawking and Milner, arrived in Moscow.  During the very first consultation, it turned out that modern technologies do not make it possible to send so many fighters to another star with any decent speed.  A new, revolutionary solution is needed, which should replace the missiles on a jet propulsion and allowing them to move in space at a speed close to the light one.  Since the choice was small, we had to dwell on the already existing idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe light sail.  It was necessary to build several dozens of laser systems that would accelerate the space sailing ship with a directional beam at speeds close to the speed of light.  Preliminary calculations led to sad conclusions.  Given the technological capabilities of mankind, you can accelerate an object weighing only three kilograms and only up to 10% of the speed of light.  Considering the distance of the star, the ship will reach its destination only 42.2 years after acceleration. <br><br>  11. 12. 2020. The new plan, despite all its risks, was the only possible one.  It was decided to abandon space marines and send only one person to the Centaurus system.  More precisely, the frozen head of one person, who will have to destroy the danger from the inside.  According to the new plan, the alien mind, which is at a higher stage of technological development, will certainly want to know its opponent better.  He will certainly be able to restore the basic vital functions of the agent.  And, thus, partially solve the problem with its delivery (braking and restoration of vital functions).  While waiting for the result, it was decided to impose a moratorium on the construction and use of any transmitting and receiving communications equipment in order to prevent the Earth from becoming infected with another Iskin.  The second part of the plan was approved by all members of the Security Council unanimously, the first was adopted with a small margin of votes, and even then only because there was no alternative plan.  Design and construction was decided to start immediately. <br><br>  29. 03. 2023. The construction of the launch system was successfully completed.  The laser systems were placed along the equator and were ready to disperse the ship.  The State Commission decided to send the most experienced person to fly, who had been tested for years of service and able to find a way out in the most difficult situations.  The final choice had to be made between two candidates, far ahead of all other competitors, Dmitry Anatolyevich and Dmitry Olegovich.  The honor to be the first messenger of humanity fell to Dmitry Anatolyevich, an expert in the field of nanotechnology and <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/291709/">Internet regulation</a> .  After the ceremonial events and medical procedures, the spacecraft launched the first star sailboat of mankind into orbit.  Four days later, the long journey began to meet the unknown.  After another 2 months, the ship accelerated to 0.1 times the speed of light and soon left the solar system. <br><br>  21.02.  2072. Proxima Centauri has gone out forever. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370697/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370697/</a></p>
