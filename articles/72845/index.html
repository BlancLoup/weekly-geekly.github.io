  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Reception of citizens: on-line document readiness check</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good afternoon friends. <br><br>  Today I will continue to talk about the developments that we are doing in our Office (UFRS in the Kurgan region, the previous articles are <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/e_gov/69505/">here</a> and <a href="http://druzhkov.habrahabr.ru/blog/67985/">here</a> ). <br><br>  So, imagine a standard situation: you handed over documents, say, for registration of a land plot, received a receipt, and now you are waiting for everything to be done.  Typically, the design goes through several stages, and it would be nice if you could follow the process of passing documents.  How about an <b>online check</b> ?  Yes, it sounds very good.  But this possibility is especially relevant if you are suddenly denied registration or it turns out that you need to bring some piece of paper.  In the classic version, you will call (when all the deadlines have passed), in the advanced version - they will call you, in ideal - you have visited the site, looked through the form that your design has been suspended, and began to calmly figure out the reason.  Convenient for citizens and for those who draw up documents.

      Focusing on all this, we have developed our own <b>online document readiness check system</b> . <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Option One: reference terminal</b> <br><br>  For training, it was originally decided to put a check on our information and reference terminal, which is in the reception hall.  Before that, I had already installed a small Denver-based web server there, through which various background information is displayed. <br><br>  Thus, the challenge was to make the interface and learn how to upload the necessary information to the mysql of this local server. <br><br>  The interface was made in JavaScript with an emulation of an on-screen digital keyboard (the pictures are clickable): <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/939/37d/be1/93937dbe1391f1d8d00bc46fec3d7480.jpg" alt="reference terminal interface"></a> <br><br>  Data uploading is carried out from the internal protected Oracle database.  To upload, mysql was transferred to listening to the external ip-address (instead of localhost), so now you can connect to it from another server and upload data.  By the way, I‚Äôll immediately note for those who want to repeat this trick: before mysql, you need to install a firewall to block unauthorized connections, plus check the hosts / users tables in the database itself. <br><br>  The system has been working successfully for about 4 months.  Judging by the statistics collected, people use it (although it is not very active so far - apparently they are still getting used to it) <br><br>  <b>Option Two: check on the site</b> <br><br>  This option was more difficult.  The main point: the reluctance to open mysql for external listening, as this is a site database accessible from anywhere in the world (unlike the previous version, when everything was limited to the local grid). <br><br>  Based on this, it was decided to do the opposite: from the web server to connect to the Oracle database and pull the necessary data.  Everything is safe, as it is done through intermediate scripts, i.e.  There is no direct connection to the internal database.  The development took about five weeks of dancing with a tambourine, googling, smoking mans and other similar things :-).  Still - bingo!  - all successfully earned. <br><br>  The form looks simple, but obviously this is only the tip of the iceberg: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e42/b52/97f/e42b5297f2195996452a9b4dad48bf51.jpg" alt="website page"></a> <br><br>  <b>results</b> <br><br>  The most important result: now the visitors who have handed in the documents can easily check at what stage their documents are.  You can come to our building and see through the terminal.  For those who have internet at home, go to the site and check right there.  Convenient, fast, vanity and hassle disappears, our experts do their work, and do not get distracted by trifles. <br><br>  I think this is a good illustration of how using IT (and, above all, web technologies), you can make life easier for many people using the services of government agencies.  In general, such a system could be useful in a variety of organizations, where there are long multi-stage paperwork procedures. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72845/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72845/</a></p>
