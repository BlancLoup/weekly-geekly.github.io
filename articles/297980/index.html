Thus, the channel expects to increase advertising profits by generating additional advertising slots. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to the representative of the ‚ÄúFirst Channel‚Äù, until recently, users have watched standard broadcast advertising in commercial breaks when watching a live broadcast through the official website of the TV channel 1tv.ru, that is, the same advertisement that was seen by ordinary viewers.  At the same time, the television company did not take these impressions into account when calculating the cost of advertising for advertisers.  Now, the company decided to change the outdated system: special online videos come to the place of broadcast advertising on the official website.  In addition, it will allow to select advertising for an online resource that is better suited to the Internet audience of the TV channel: 60% of 1tv.ru visitors are younger than 34 years old, and every fourth user is a young man under 25 years old. <br><br>  Previously, companies could order online advertising on 1tv.ru, which was displayed only when ‚Äúdeferred‚Äù viewing of certain video materials (TV shows, news, etc.) in the form of separate clips.  The sale of such advertising space for several years has been the company IMHO Vi, which is part of the Vi group responsible for over-the-air advertising.  IMHO Vi CEO Ilya Alekseev confirmed that his company will undertake to distribute the appeared free slots during the live broadcast.

      Ilya Bulavinov, head of the First TV Channel‚Äôs Internet Broadcasting Directorate, notes that, on average, about 15 million unique visitors visit the website of the TV company, two thirds of these users regularly watch video content on the site, and 3.5 million of them watch the live broadcast.  The most popular events on the official website of the channel in 2015, Bulavinov, called the broadcast of the Eurovision final, the Victory Parade on May 9 and the New Year's Eve on the First Channel. <br><br>  According to Ilya, at the end of 2014, on First Channel, there was a shortage of advertising space for online videos, i.e., demand exceeded the supply of the television company.  As a result, it was decided to replace part of the on-air advertising with 1tv.ru with special promo videos.  Due to this, the head of the webcasting directorate expects an increase in advertising inventory by 35-45%. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297980/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297980/</a></p>
