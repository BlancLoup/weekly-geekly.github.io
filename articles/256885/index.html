Support remains the only point of contact with the client and the result will depend on how it interacts with other departments.  Either the client‚Äôs problem will remain from Krylov's fable, or a turnip that the friendly family has jointly pulled out. <br><br>  Here is a simple case in perfect conditions. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In the online store, the client saw a backpack with a 10% discount, was delighted, paid from the card, watched, and the discount turned out to be 5% of everything.  There are two tasks for Vasya‚Äôs support agent: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
      Find the source of the error <br>  Settle claim <br><br>  Without help here is not enough.  To find a mistake, you need to write: developers, accounting, marketing.  Wait for all the answer.  Depending on the nature of the problem, propose a solution: issue a refund or donate another discount for 2 products - and coordinate these solutions with colleagues. <br><br>  Now imagine that the company has no rules of interaction.  As I could, I contacted my colleagues: Skype, mail, FB.  You can still go to each neighboring department, ask: "And check and then write to me on the result."  Attention, question.  How many problems a day will Vasya be able to solve this way?  Not to lose information on any one and get feedback from colleagues as quickly as possible? <br><br>  Obviously, it is difficult for Vasya to control the course of solving the problem in different channels.  Maybe Vasya use only outlook?  But then he will be faced with shipments that will turn the client's letter into an unrecognizable monster and save the logical chain will not succeed anyway.  How does this threaten Vasya?  He will hate work and howl like a wolf when everything falls out of his hands.  How does this threaten the client?  At best, his question will be answered later than he expected, at worst the problem will remain unresolved and the customer will be charged to buy at this store. <br><br>  It is difficult to set up the process around the client - not in words, but in practice.  Corporate culture rules and team building trainings will not help if you don‚Äôt have the right tool in your hands.  In Usedesk, we offer to communicate between departments with the help of comments.  Comments are not visible to the client.  These are internal notes of employees regarding the treatment of the client.  No forwarding and lost emails, no deaf phone.  Vasya needs to ask the developer a question - he assigns the request to him and writes an internal comment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a8/739/238/4a873923862c4149986bfd22ee5120bd.png"><br><br>  Now, literally: in the center of the processes is the client‚Äôs appeal.  For a teller or IT-client, the client is no longer the abstract god that they heard about at the planning meeting.  Here they themselves formulated the problem, here is his spelling and mood.  When the whole team encounters a ‚Äúlive‚Äù client, it helps everyone to see and quickly patch the ‚Äúholes‚Äù in their own direction.  Fix a bug on the site, change the order of return, dismiss a rough courier.  Another important point: the history of solving the problem is preserved.  What someone said and who is to blame - the weak link is (and repaired) without difficulty. <br><br>  We in Usedesk came up with the role of ‚Äúinternal employee‚Äù especially for non-client departments.  The good news is that you can add as many employees as you like for free :) They only write comments and help support agents with difficult questions.  Pulling the turnips, feeling each other, is much easier) <br><br>  Steep you service.  Stay close to customers.
