What the hell is going on with netbooks?  Why did I want a netbook but didn‚Äôt buy it?  Why are today's netbooks not even needed for nothing? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Why do I need a netbook? </h4><br><br>  Let's start with why I need a netbook.  Most importantly: I need it for work.  Not for movies, not for games, not for ponta.  View sites, e-mail, work with texts and tables, read, sometimes output to a projector or a large screen.  From here two groups of requirements follow: to the screen and to the keyboard. 
      <br>

        </script>
      <br>
      Secondly, it is clear that I need a device of this class for mobile work.  Hence the requirements for size, weight and battery life. <br><br>  There are more requirements: to the materials of the case, to the communication interfaces, etc.  I will tell about them below. <br><br><h4>  And what does the majority of modern netbooks offer? </h4><br><br>  Very small screens with giant, fatty, hypertrophied frames.  On one of my laptops, the frame is already a centimeter.  In the same netbook frame eats at least an inch of the place that could occupy the screen.  And after all, there are no engineering problems to make the screen larger, while maintaining the dimensions by narrowing the frame. <br><br>  The screens are not just small.  They are still, like, "widescreen".  1024x600  It may be normal to watch movies, but this reduces the productivity of working with text, both reading and writing, significantly.  Very noticeable.  It would seem that some 168 pixels, and what is the difference in convenience.  More precisely, in the inconvenience. <br><br>  At 600 pixels in height, not all the system dialogues of the Windows are, by the way. <br>  Now the sweetest.  Most netbooks have glossy screens!  The combination of a small and narrow screen with mediocre quality matrix and nehily highlights, for example, from lamps at the airport, turns most netbooks from tools into toys. <br><br><h4>  A dirty, nasty, all-consuming gloss </h4><br><br>  And additive to sweets.  Glossy body.  Glossy covers.  Glossy frames.  Glossy touchpads. <br><br>  It would seem that here is a more or less normal netbook.  Matte screen and not too dirt-collecting keyboard, strict body without vulgar signs, light bulbs and pimpusechki: <br><br><img src="http://mobiguru.ru/f/image/1/6/2/16205676_hp_5101_mini_4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But it looks so good on the official photo.  In fact, it looks like this: <br><br><img src="http://netbooked.net/images/uploads/articles/hp-mini-5101-a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/98a/52b/b75/98a52bb7572325894bf97e827268cdcd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Notice how all the highlights are cleaned on the official photo.  I even bought it, went to the store, and there ... Vigorously glaring plastic that collects prints faster than the homeless beer bottles. <br><br>  Even if there is a non-glare matte screen, the laptop is fucked up with a vulgar glossy frame.  As soon as you take the cover to change its inclination, the frame will be covered with prints, like a station square like a crouch.  That same frame that will shine into your eyes, distracting from work and making it difficult to concentrate. <br><br>  The lid will also be covered with prints, and instead of a normal, strict, neat laptop in your hands will be zasratnaya, stained plastic garbage.  The monuments cased by birds look more aesthetic. <br><br>  The same garbage with photos of another netbook from HP.  Here is the official photo, where all these vulgar highlights are tidied: <br><br><img src="http://h10032.www1.hp.com/ctg/Images/c01817523.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here is a photo from real life, full schandz.  Unconditional Cadaveric Glossy Preved.  Pay attention to the upper left corner of the frame: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c84/7c3/6f1/c847c36f16d1fbb888566e74ef9fedb5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://www.paperpage.ru/news/nouti/HP/mini311/hpmini311_03.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But almost made a cool netbook!  There was a stylish case for the model 2140, but it was also debased with a glossy screen with a glossy frame: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/774/537/eec/774537eec2c6fd3bde369cfc56a2fd1e.jpg" alt="image"><br><h4>  Asus holds the mark.  From the word "Mark"? </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a32/d19/cee/a32d19cee9f1bb73c8b603cc786f6c84.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here is the ASUS Eee PC 1201N.  Why does he need a dual-core processor and Nvidia Ion?  Good, large portable mirror.  It remains instead of a keyboard to place powder and eye shadow, paint the cover pink, upholster with fur and sprinkle with rhinestones.  There will be such a puffy cosmetic bag. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/234/208/e78/234208e781a1615c7200c1c11046cff9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Is the glossy surface to the left and right of the touchpad made specifically to get your fingerprints in the first five seconds of work? <br><br><h5>  Netbook makers, aly!  Are you there cho, competing, whose device will get stuck faster?  Or who will break the user's eyes faster and make him vomit? </h5><br><br><h4>  What you need from a netbook: </h4><br><br><ul><li>  Matte screen.  11 inches, at least 768 points in height. </li><li>  Matte cover.  Matt surfaces.  Matt all.  No vulgar gloss.  Gloss - it's gone. </li><li>  A narrow frame around the screen.  Matt, stretch your left, matt! </li><li>  Weight less than 1.5 pounds. </li><li>  Sizes smaller than 12-inch notebooks with narrow frames.  With narrow frames, spread your left, with narrow! </li><li>  The battery life is more than 5 hours. </li><li>  The battery, not getting out an ugly ledge for dimensions. </li><li>  Klava without cracks, collecting dust and crumbs.  To ask about the backlight of engineers who put glossy surfaces around the touchpad is already beyond the limits of what can be done. </li><li>  Wi-Fi, bluetooth, LAN.  SD card reader.  Output to an external monitor. </li><li>  No bulbs, especially shining in the eyes.  If you want light bulbs - place them so that when looking at the screen they are not visible. </li></ul><br><h4>  Still, someone, explain to me the nature of such a painful, pathological cravings of netbook makers to an all-matched glossy? </h4><br><br>  I thought it was for people to taste more expensive laptops.  But no, they are already using laptops! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/82993/">https://habr.com/ru/post/82993/</a></p>
