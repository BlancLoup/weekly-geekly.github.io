The main goal was to move with the least possible loss for workers.  And as quickly as possible. <br><br>  <strong>December 25 (-16 days)</strong> <br>  I manage to order in Moscow box and everything you need for installation.  I run, sticking my tongue out, shopping, buying everything on the list.  From my mobile, I take pictures of the graphics of the stores, in order to be able to buy something if it is needed. <br><br>  Approximately 60 meters of power cable, 100 meters of a telephone cable, 160 meters of a network cable go into the purchase.  10 outlets for the phone, 10 outlets for the network, 14 outlets for electricians.  34 meters of boxes in the amount.  On 30 pieces of network ends, caps.  Crimping tools, screwdrivers, screws, etc.

      Employees in the office should pack at this time, leaving only furniture and equipment. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>December 26 (-15 days)</strong> <br>  Shops, shops, more shops.  We have a corporate New Year, and tomorrow I‚Äôm looking for boxes.  Vernadsky Prospect stands in traffic for the third day in a row, so tomorrow it will be necessary to leave tomorrow, very early. <br><br>  Corporate finish at about 2 am. <br><br>  <strong>December 27 (-14 days)</strong> <br>  I leave for the boxes at 6 am.  By 9 o'clock we are in place, but box vendors only work from 10 o'clock, so I sleep a couple of hours in the car.  This, in general, is very useful, since I am still drunk after corporate parties. <br><br>  I am taking the box.  Everything is counted, packed, brought to a new office. <br><br>  <strong>December 28 (-13 days)</strong> <br>  We start with the brother to fix the box to the walls.  It turns out that the wall panels were laid by the Tajiks by foot, not by hand.  We close the boxes unevenness styling.  During the day we have time to put about 10 meters of boxes, we come across the fact that the saw, which I intended to cut the box, does not fit. <br><br>  At lunch, we buy a hacksaw for metal and lay out about 3 more meters (laying is already more difficult, the box must be cut).  I work as a ‚ÄúCertified LeGrand box laser‚Äù, using a hacksaw like a scalpel. <br><br>  <strong>December 29 (-12 days)</strong> <br>  Still we put the box, I start in breaks to make the layout of sockets, removing part of the power cables.  We put about another 10 meters per day.  I never get tired to be surprised at the wisdom of the French - such a thought-out system of sockets causes multiple orgasms during installation. <br><br>  <strong>December 30 (-11 days)</strong> <br>  Again we put 10 meters, however, there are still more difficulties, because we put the box with the brother exactly in level, then at the end of the room they do not converge by 3 cm with the level of the panels.  To the mothers of the Tajiks, what is the world worth? <br><br>  <strong>December 31 (-10 days)</strong> <br>  All boxes are, but there is still a lot of work ahead.  I almost have time to finish doing the electrics (sockets), but they are not yet connected to the network, because the electrician cannot be found.  The fourth day of work, I work until 4 pm, then I go to celebrate NG. <br><br>  <strong>January 1 (-9 days)</strong> <br>  New Year.  I do not work on this day, because I understand that I need to rest.  It is necessary.  Trying not to think about what remains to be. <br><br>  <strong>January 2 (-8 days)</strong> <br>  I finish laying the electrics (14 outlets, but the electrician hasn‚Äôt yet found and hasn‚Äôt connected anything yet) and almost all the telephone wires.  With a multimeter everything has been checked already about 5 times. <br><br>  <strong>January 3 (-7 days)</strong> <br>  According to the scheme from LeGrand, I mount 10 power outlets and crimp the wires.  Brought laptop shows that nothing works.  A multimeter shows that either I am an idiot and a color blind, or a typo in the French.  Pereobzhim again tests, everything works.  I finish with the phones.  The server corner is like a scary spider, where all the wires are gathered in a heap. <br><br>  <strong>January 4 (-6 days)</strong> <br>  A miracle is accomplished and an electrician is sought.  However, it is impossible to get into the room where the shield is located.  A couple of outlets, he mounts under the current.  Thank him.  The office, in general, is ready for the delivery of furniture and equipment, we do a dry cleaning with my brother, dust stands.  Everything, new office from the room turned into a haven for computers. <br><br>  In the evening I begin to disassemble the furniture in the old office.  I mark components, I collect screws.  For half a day I manage to disassemble the entire furniture of one department, except for a pair of cabinets.  Leave in the morning. <br><br>  <strong>January 5 (-5 days)</strong> <br>  From 8 am I continue to disassemble the furniture, by 12 movers arrive and by 2 pm it is possible to transport everything to a new office.  The building administrator is trying to stop me, but she does not understand that it is dangerous to stop me after a week of work, 8-12 hours a day.  Of course, I will take everything. <br><br>  For the second half of the day I manage to collect all the furniture brought.  Local Tajiks go out onto the porch of the building to listen to the music of Mouzon screaming in my room. <br><br>  <strong>January 6 (-4 days)</strong> <br>  I continue to disassemble the furniture in the old office.  There is a lot of it, some of the furniture was made to order, so it is not easy to understand.  From the analysis of furniture and the preparation of equipment for transportation, from constant dust hands terribly wilt and skin cracks.  Cream?  Do not make me laugh :) <br><br>  Movers take out some of the furniture.  This time, the work is much like more than 5 numbers. <br><br>  <strong>January 7 (-3 days)</strong> <br>  I work for several hours, then I go to celebrate Christmas in a warm company.  All equipment is ready to move, the furniture is not yet.  Total: 10 monitors, 14 system units. <br><br>  <strong>January 8 (-2 days)</strong> <br>  The Embassy of Finland starts working, so the food is applying for a Schengen visa.  You have to get up at 5 am to be there for the opening.  Documents are accepted, but to pay the consular fee, the bank will start working only tomorrow, and the fee must be paid within 2-3 days.  There is no choice, tomorrow again in Moscow. <br><br>  From about 3 o'clock in the afternoon I start transporting equipment by taxi (cargo will not work).  5 walker with trunk and rear seat filled to capacity.  I bet that I have time, while I do not connect anything. <br><br>  <strong>January 9 (-1 day)</strong> <br>  Employees become cautiously interested in when work begins.  In response, I can only growl incessantly, for 6 employees, while being packed, left so much dirt, debris, and unprepared things to transport, that a huge amount of time is spent on dismantling debris and discarding unnecessary. <br><br>  On the phone in the old office, while I‚Äôm preparing there, customers periodically ring up, there‚Äôs little use, for I can‚Äôt say anything yet.  The brain is beating the thought "Get there!"  Have time!  Catch! ‚Äù <br><br>  <strong>January 10 (day 0)</strong> <br>  Last day in the old office.  We begin to move at 10 o'clock, but here the local freaks (or rather, the freaks led by the building‚Äôs commandant) turn off the elevator.  Movers swear, but there is nothing to do, they are ready to wear even until the evening.  I continue to disassemble the remains of furniture. <br><br>  By 7 o'clock in the evening (it shakes me when I remember this day) we are finally moving.  We assemble furniture until 12 o'clock at night. <br><br>  Employees have already gone to work and work.  Rather, work those whom I managed to collect jobs. <br><br>  <strong>January 11 (day 1)</strong> <br>  People are already working in the office, there is a network, there is work.  And it boils.  There is no internet or phone yet.  People communicate by mobile.  It's hard, but it's still going. <br><br>  I'm going to clean up the old office.  I deduce half a ton of garbage, but now there is clean and you can rent the room to the landlord. <br><br>  With my left foot, I am preparing a contract with my own mother about renting a room in order to transfer the telephone.  The joke with the phone is that you cannot transfer it to a new address (another PBX), you can put it in some room next to the old address, and from there you can redirect to the new number.  But this is not done by programming the PBX, but is done from the device. <br><br>  Again, collect furniture to hell knows how much.  So pass and the weekend at the same time. <br><br>  <strong>January 14 (day 4)</strong> <br>  The date of installation of the phone to our office and to my mom's apartment is set (to make call forwarding).  I bite my nails.  There is no Internet yet.  When it will be difficult to say. <br><br>  <strong>January 15 (day 5)</strong> <br>  Breakthrough.  We connect the phone to the office, I run my favorite Panasonic PBX.  Everything is working!  HOORAY!  At the same time on the same day connect the Internet. <br><br>  <strong>January 16 (day 6)</strong> <br>  They set the phone to my mom (not without problems, of course), I set the redirection.  It is possible to save the gold number from moving and from loss :) <br><br>  <strong>January 17 (day 7)</strong> <br>  I go to Moscow, get a Schengen visa and buy tickets for 21 numbers to Finland. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18926/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18926/</a></p>
