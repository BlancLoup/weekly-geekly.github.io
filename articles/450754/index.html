The Russian company Caterville became the winner of the championship. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uj/oo/qo/ujooqoa88lazv97pgqkr7dnqoua.jpeg"><br><br>  The wheelchair pilot competition (Yury Larin in the photo on the left) includes a special obstacle course that simulates the everyday difficulties that people often face with various spinal cord injuries or other serious injuries that prevent them from walking.

      "Race track" includes areas where you need to skillfully maneuver in a closed space: pass between furniture, turn around on a small platform, and so on.  The wheelchair should also be able to adapt to different surfaces, ride over rough terrain, slopes and climb stairs. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4cNj0DICZds" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The main mission of the Cybathlon Championship is to encourage manufacturers and start-up teams to innovative solutions that help people with disabilities to become more independent and independent in their daily activities. <br><br>  This year <a href="http://www.cybathlonseriesjp.com/">CYBATHLON Wheelchair</a> was held in Kawasaki Prefecture, Tokyo, Japan.  Among the participants are Asian and European developers who made their prototypes of wheelchairs specifically for the competition.  The presented wheelchairs are equipped with technological solutions that allow to overcome various obstacles, such as stairs, slides or doorways, while remaining not too bulky, easily settling down at a regular table. <br><br>  The Russian company Caterville became the winner of the championship, and in the course of the final race took second place, putting its serial carriage on the track, which is now being sold on the Russian and foreign markets.  Pilot pilot Yury Larin didn‚Äôt have a bit of luck to win. <br><br>  The Novosibirsk stroller-all-terrain vehicle Caterwil GTS3 EXPORT is an upgraded version of the stroller-step GTS3 stroller, surpassing its predecessor in speed and power reserve.  Production of the new model was launched in April 2019, but the product is already in demand.  It was this, a market-oriented wheelchair, that brought silver to the Russians. <br><br>  On the way to the finals, the Russian team outstripped 6 other all-terrain vehicle development teams from Japan and Hong Kong, and in the final, fought the HSR Echanced team from Switzerland.  Bypassing the rival in speed, and showing a high permeability, the pilot Caterville crossed the finish line first. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the heat of passion made itself felt in the final race: at the first obstacle, the Russian team made a mistake, and the chair touched the desk, which should drop in without touching.  According to the competition regulations, the passage of this obstacle was not counted.  Penalty points made the Swiss a winner, and the Russian got silver.  The third place was taken by the team from Japan, losing to the stroller "Caterville" in the semifinal. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAmong all the winners, only <a href="http://rirportal.ru/ru-RU/potrebitelyam-i-zakupshchikam-1/catalog%3FProductApiSearch%255BtrademarkId%255D%3D112">Caterwil GTS</a> is a commercial product, while the rest of the teams presented prototypes that were not intended for everyday use,‚Äù said company leader Ivan Nevzorov. <br><br>  According to the developer, the advantage of the Russian stroller over competitors <br>  is that it is made simply and securely.  In Caterville, an original mechanic was used - a combination of tracked drive technology and a wheel drive.  This is the only stroller in the world with a double chassis. <br><br>  Caterville is already a two-time CYBATHLON Wheelchair champion.  In the past models, the Novosibirsk carriages became the competition winners in 2017 and 2018.  Caterwil plans to regain the championship in May next year, at CYBATHLON 2020, which will be held in Zurich, Switzerland. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4g/gx/zp/4ggxzpde_dpmmtw-iojogadmhrc.jpeg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/450754/">https://habr.com/ru/post/450754/</a></p>
