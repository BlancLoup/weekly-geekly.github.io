Even with the constant migration in search of an even more lamp office and a larger assortment of buns, this figure is 1-2 years.  It is at this moment that programmers begin to remember the password on LinkedIn, chaotically create a resume on HH and other resources.  Those who have done it at least once remember this process with horror and the desire to devote their next startup to writing a universal button for publishing a summary to all the major job portals of the world.  Then a week or two or three in search and voila!  and the information on all the job portals again loses its relevance for a year or two. <a name="habracut"></a>

      What do we see in the end?  The exponential growth of interest at a certain point in time and the virtual absence of any activity over the course of months.  This can not but bother the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù portals for finding IT staff.  Formally, the number of accounts is large, but the activity and return rate of users is negligible. <br><br><h4>  At the same time in another life ... </h4><br>  ... any more or less advanced developer asks questions and gets answers to StackOverflow.com, publishes his projects on GitHub, CodePlex and BitBucket, activates on thematic forums, writes and comments on articles in Habr√©, and publishes various moments of his life in social networks. <br><br>  Feel the difference?  Developers <i>live</i> on these resources, and LinkedIn or HH is <i>sometimes used</i> . <br><br>  For those who still doubt StackOverflow, I‚Äôll provide an interesting infographic (click for an image to open it in full size): <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2c5/f3e/46e/2c5f3e46e0afc159907f455179bafee3.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  17 million unique users visit this site every month and the site grows by 20-30% per year. <br><br>  I believe this happens for several reasons: <br><br><ul><li>  StackOverflow was done by professionals.  Initially.  This means that no one rewrote the photo module several times, did not optimize the C ++ compiler, did not invent contests and closed clubs to attract the audience.  The site works mega fast (project architecture is described <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/3/3/stack-overflow-architecture-update-now-at-95-million-page-vi.html">here</a> ).  And yes, the project is written in ASP.NET MVC and is hosted on a Windows server, and all this is served by a team of up to 20 people. </li><li>  StackOverflow combines the functions of Q &amp; A, as well as elements of the forum, chat, social network, as well as an inexhaustible source of statistics. </li><li>  The site has developed a unique system of ratings and gamification (unlike ... I will not poke a finger), which is why a high-quality audience has formed, which does not chase after badges or other attributes of "power".  By the way, the more ‚Äúpumped‚Äù the profile, the more ‚Äúpower‚Äù the users have - they can vote to close stupid questions, transfer them to read-only mode, etc. </li><li>  The site has <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/22656/jon-skeet">John Skit</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/570689/">Dmitry Malikov</a> .  <s>They say that negotiations are underway with Chuck Norris.</s> </li><li>  Ability to create your own community on all sorts of topics (combined under the brand Stack Exchange).  But not to create everything, but only popular communities.  Well, end-to-end integration between all projects. </li></ul><br>  Career 2.0 is a resource that has not yet become a substitute for LinkedIn, but it may well become a ‚Äústandard‚Äù for finding IT people in the future (and with the growing popularity of other communities, not only for IT people).  And given the close integration with all popular resources - from Twitter to GitHub, we can say that Careers covers the entire life cycle of a developer - from education to written source code. <br><br><h4>  Why a StackOverflow profile is a good resume </h4><br>  What are the main questions asked at interviews in most companies? <br><br><ol><li>  Tell us about your education. </li><li>  Tell us about your work experience. </li><li>  What technologies did you work with? </li><li>  What projects did they take part in, what was their level of complexity? </li><li>  Pass the test and show examples of written code. </li></ol><br>  Resume and LinekdIn profile can <i>formally</i> answer all these questions, but they will not answer exactly the other, more important ones: <br><br><ol><li>  How did the applicant go into this or that technology or subject area? </li><li>  How long has he used this or that technology, skill, etc.? </li><li>  Is he a real ‚Äúseignor developer‚Äù or just decided to call himself that? </li></ol><br>  Imagine, for example, such a situation.  The applicant indicated the technologies with which he worked: ASP.NET, WPF, SharePoint, JavaScript, Java.  But on ASP.NET, he executed 20 projects, and on Java, only one.  Thus, to realistically assess the professional (and even more so) the quality of the applicant in terms of technologies and platforms (and their current versions) is practically impossible without a one-to-one interview. <br><br>  And what about StackOverflow?  In addition to formal questions about education and technology, you can see what questions the applicant likes, what answers he gives and which questions, which projects he leads on GitHub and CodePlex, and which people / projects follow when the last project on the technology you are interested in.  You can also see that the applicant is in the top 5% of all specialists in the hashtag ‚ÄúC #‚Äù or ‚ÄúJava‚Äù. <br><br>  This approach allows us to assess the real level of the applicant, and not the subjective perception of reality by him or an HR specialist.  You can also easily associate the applicant's level with the compensation conditions he asks for. <br><br>  All the same, you need to keep your profile ‚Äúup to date‚Äù, at least on SO, at least on LinkedIn, - you will say and you will be right.  But IT professionals are more disposed to contribute data to those resources where they are every day.  Does the average IT user go to LinkedIn at least once a day?  But on SO comes. <br><br>  I agree, not so often met domestic companies that accepted the reference to SO instead of a resume.  Such companies +100,500 in karma (you can even karma on SO).  There are separate companies that ask to bring a resume to the corporate standard!  Hopefully, this practice will soon die. <br><br><h4>  Remember BrainchOut? </h4><br>  BrainchOut is an application that LinkedIn wanted to become on Facebook.  The explosive growth, all of each other zapolovili, went and went on, and this all sank. <br><br>  Even at the start of the project it was clear that nothing from this undertaking will work.  Facebook is a social network where people mostly relax, maximum, looking for each other, but in 99% of cases professional communication continues elsewhere and on a different site.  Right, who would ever think of Facebook posting their completed projects?  Professional groups are one thing, but resume and hiring are another. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  The main task of all the job portals is to get job seekers to use their services more actively and on a regular basis.  And while they are building up their resume database at the expense of students and those laid off at the height of the crisis, IT professionals and pros are looking for other ways to be helpful to each other. <br><br>  At the same time, all popular online platforms that control the professional activities of progromism (the same Habr) have excellent chances in the future to become major players in the field of search and recruitment.  They, in contrast to the modern IT portal job portals, have everything in order with the activity of these IT specialists. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/198014/">https://habr.com/ru/post/198014/</a></p>
