I was wrong, the phone has unique features and excellent ergonomics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/da9/5cb/d95/da95cbd958c5fd0afab162bbcbc2233f.png"><br><br>  Most of you know that the Moto X options are full, you can build your X on the <a href="https://www.motorola.com/us/motomaker%3Fpid%3DFLEXR1">MotoMaker</a> website the <a href="https://www.motorola.com/us/motomaker%3Fpid%3DFLEXR1">way</a> you want: a sleek matte or carbon body, a black or white front panel, 18 options for the back panel colors, 7 colors for frames and buttons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/737/b20/abd/737b20abdc1238b3ae2bd2bfb2ca7bc0.jpg"><br><br>  And at the end of 2013, Moto X made of wood will go on sale.  Exclusively for the operator AT &amp; T.  Such a phone will cost $ 50 more than a regular model.  Previously it is known that 4 versions will be on sale: from bamboo, teak, ebony and rosewood. <br><br>  I have never paid attention to such a detail as a box, as I believe that in 2013 it should be a priori perfect.  But in Moto X, the packaging really liked it: it is bright, beautiful and at the same time looks expensive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/b24/f76/7b0/b24f767b089e4d95a75227d89c76affa.png"><br><br>  Included are all standard: phone, headphones of average quality, clip for SIM-card, USB, charging. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/4e0/33c/d4e/4e033cd4e7a516a159c5c4394cc03bdb.png"><br><br>  The front of the Moto X is covered with Magic Glass, the next generation of Gorilla glasses.  Perhaps this is self-hypnosis or just a new device, but to the touch this glass is very nice, much nicer than on my Nexus 4 and iPhone 5. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/397/ea0/1b1/397ea01b19e682307913d36646e92f7e.png"><br><br>  Taking into account that the screen of Moto X and Nexus is identical in size - 4.7 inches, in my hand the Motorola phone feels noticeably smaller.  And this is good news, since working with one hand in it is really convenient (unlike the Nexus 4).  Such ergonomics is achieved due to the small frames and reducing the thickness of the body at the edges. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/e01/42a/0b6/e0142a0b6da3eaec43c0eabe9a80f4ea.png"><br><br>  I tested the carbon black version.  It is very soft and very pleasant. <br><br>  In general, with regard to tactile sensations, there is a solid five with two pluses: Motorola did their best, the phone looks and ‚Äúmoves off‚Äù with the same and genuine delight. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/edc/332/30b/edc33230bdb6a90f4ec3f2fb8df4bdbe.png"><br><br>  The display of the Moto X is Super AMOLED.  I never liked this matrix, because I most often saw it on Samsung devices.  Today, I realized that those rich colors that she passes spoil the TouchWiz shell.  On Moto X with a bare Android, the display looks more than elegant: with Nexus 4, brightness and saturation cannot be compared. <br><br>  Returning to the question of Nexus-similarity, I will give another example of the work of iron. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/143/8e1/307/1438e1307b3d471087d4d0dd138c85fb.png"><br><br>  Moto X is gaining almost 22 thousand points, my Nexus 4 on Android 4.3 is gaining 14 thousand points.  But I want to say that this is not an indicator, HTC One, Galaxy S4 are gaining even more, but Moto X is the fastest: this is the most ‚Äúsmart‚Äù Android-smartphone, which I kept.  ( <i>see video</i> ) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/01f/d84/fc9/01fd84fc9c4b596eba0f463897489651.png"><br><br>  <b>Unique Moto X features. Voice control</b> <br><br>  Android has voice control - there is Google Now.  But in order to turn it on, you must click on the screen.  In Moto X, you do not need to press anything, you just need to say ‚ÄúOk, Google Now‚Äù and the service will start.  Even if the phone is locked, the service will start. <br><br>  It is noteworthy that in Moto X there is no Russian, but Google Now works in Russian. <br><br>  <b>Active display</b> <br><br>  I liked this feature the most.  Active Display is when all the necessary notifications hang on the phone and do not spend the charge.  We remember this perfectly on the old Nokia S60-series phones.  Here it works like this: the phone is lying, nobody touches it.  If you take it in hand, it will immediately show how many SMS are missed, calls and whether there is mail.  In the pocket, the proximity sensor works, so the screen will not light up just there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/e7f/946/3fa/e7f9463faaf08b73927b9ce6aaf9542a.png"><br><br>  <b>Camera</b> <br><br>  Another interesting feature is the inclusion of the camera.  To do this, you need to sharply shake the phone left-right and the camera will turn on.  It works in the lock mode.  Many wrote that the function is not properly activated, but I did not find any shortcomings.  Moreover, I also really liked it: you take out the phone and quickly turn on the camera.  Perfectly. <br><br>  As for the photos themselves, Clear Pixel technology is used here, which allows you to take good photos in low light.  In fact, I did not see anything like it. <br><br>  Metro Photo: <a href="">iPhone 5</a> and <a href="">Moto X</a> <br><br>  As for shooting in daylight, Moto X pleasantly surprises.  The number of parts is much more than the iPhone 5, and noise, on the contrary, is less. <br><br>  Photo 1: <a href="">iPhone 5</a> and <a href="">Moto X</a> <br>  Photo 2: <a href="">iPhone 5</a> and <a href="">Moto X</a> <br><br>  <i><b>Note</b> : I am sure that there will be ‚Äúphoto experts‚Äù who will say that the iPhone shoots better.</i>  <i>I want to upset you: saturation means nothing.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/bbd/8d4/f75/bbd8d4f75decf600c96302cb6a2202d0.png"><br><br>  <b>findings</b> <br><br>  Moto X is a work of art.  I do not get tired of writing that this is the best Android smartphone that I kept.  And the alternative in the form of Nexus 4 ... it is, of course, present, but Moto X has several unique features, it has an incredible design, it is smaller in size and the display is much richer.  If you compare any phone with Nexus 4, you can say that the price is everything.  Even with the iPhone 5S can be compared.  But this is a completely different level.  Here 5S and Moto X can be compared: two premium products, among which you can choose and think (although what am I talking about? Of course, the iPhone 5S is cooler). <br><br>  In fact, Motorola has not lost the price, the phone will be bought even abroad, although the primary and only audience is US residents.  People have an interest and it is genuine, and besides, as it happens in such cases, self-promotion will work - people will shout about what a cool phone it is.  But the most interesting thing about it is that this is true - the device is great. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> If you have read the article or watched the video and are now aware of all the features of Moto X, please answer the question in the survey. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/193924/">https://habr.com/ru/post/193924/</a></p>
