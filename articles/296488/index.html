They can be sent to users of Google Chrome (55%) and Apple Safari (5.2%), which is 350 million people. <br><br>  Each message contains: header, text (maximum 125 characters in Cyrillic), image and link. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1b2/b1a/f71/1b2b1af71dcd46dfb901a8f0b3492707.png">

      If you use Bitrix24 CRM or communicate with colleagues via Slack, then such push-notifications should be familiar.  The message from the Slack service looks like this on the screen: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ba2/c60/105/ba2c60105034459da0421dfc4eda1ba4.png"><br><br>  <b>How it works?</b> <br><ol><li>  A visitor enters the site </li><li>  A dialog box appears asking you to activate push notifications. </li><li>  If the visitor agrees, he is entered into the subscriber database. </li><li>  He receives a push notification with any information. </li><li>  He clicks on it and follows the link to the site. </li></ol><br><br>  <b>What are the benefits of push notifications?</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  They are displayed over all windows, even if the browser is closed: it will be very difficult to miss such a message; </li><li>  When you click the user goes directly to the site - no further action; </li><li>  Users do not receive spam, because the distribution occurs only after permission and for a specific device of the user, with whom he gave permission; </li><li>  Accurate hit to the target audience; </li><li>  To receive push notifications do not need additional software; </li><li>  The price of push-messages is several times lower than SMS; </li><li>  Unsubscribe can be done in one click. </li></ul><br><br>  Of course, to paint the benefits of any much.  Not to be unfounded, let's talk about real-life cases, how famous companies use this tool to communicate with the target audience. <br><br><h4>  Push Notification Cases </h4><br><br><h4>  Abc News </h4><br><br>  ABC News is the news section of the television network American Broadcasting Company.  They deliver news via push.  The company has achieved a high level of individuality of mailings due to the fact that it has created a convenient system for selecting topics and stories for subscriptions.  During the first five months after the launch of push notifications, more than one million news stories were viewed. <br><br>  <b>By linking push notifications at the time of the news release, the company increased the number of views five times.</b>  Such well-known news portals such as: The New York Times, Apple Insider, CNN, The Next Web also use browser push notifications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e4/4b0/c1e/1e44b0c1efe34167940bcd713ba9c3be.png"><br><br>  Most of the tools in the field of Internet marketing first appear in the United States, and only then spread to other countries.  In the case of push notifications, the situation is similar.  Abroad, major media outlets are already using this tool to engage the audience in their content, and in our country it does not even smell like that. <br><br>  I am sure that this is only a matter of time.  Soon, our major online media will ‚Äúpush‚Äù their readers.  But when will this happen?  As always, after 5 years?  Almost like with <a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie-what-is-it/">A / B testing</a> .  In such a situation it is very important to be the first ... <br><br><h4>  Walgreens </h4><br><br>  Walgreens is a large pharmacy network in the United States with about 7,000 branches.  In addition to advertising, the company sends push notifications with the recipes of its customers and the medicines that they take.  Each user can receive individual reminders about taking medication at the right time of day.  As well as notices of the need to purchase new medicines, when the medicines purchased earlier are running out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/84a/063/0a2/84a0630a213e471caf014942ee5f05a8.png"><br><br>  In this case, notifications are not only a way to attract potential customers.  <b>Get an individual reminder about taking medication - isn't that cool?</b>  <b>This is a great way to build a loyal target audience that will only buy from you.</b>  After all, you carry value, take care of your customers and even remind them of when to take a pill.  Very competent approach, in my opinion. <br><br><h4>  Air canada <br></h4><br><br>  Air Canada is the largest Canadian airline.  Uses push notifications to send flight information.  The airline informs users about changes in flight schedules, the beginning of check-in, the completion of baggage checking, flight transfer, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e0/c3b/18c/0e0c3b18c92d4be4a9c2b90152ba49fd.png"><br><br><h4>  New features push notifications: </h4><br><br><h5>  1. Bulk mailings </h5><br><br>  This is the easiest and most understandable way to use push notifications.  You collect the user base, send them information about products and services, advertising materials, motivate users to make a purchase. <br><br>  <b>At the same time, the number of transitions from push messages is higher than from email newsletters.</b>  <b>According to research results, the minimum figure is 3%, and the highest - 20-25%.</b> <br>  According to some <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/insiders/roost-content-marketing-distribution">statistical data,</a> conversion to push notification subscriptions in some cases can be 30 times higher than on an e-mail list.  <b>The minimum conversion of push-notifications is 2%, the average is 5%, and the maximum is 28%</b> <br>  Perhaps this is due to the fact that subscribing to such notifications is much easier, as well as disabling them.  The less action you have to do, the better.  The numbers confirm this. <br><br>  <i>Article in topic - <a href="http://boosta.ru/e-mail-marketing/anatomiya-triggernyx-email-rassylok-ves-instrument-za-7-minut/">Bleed E-mail marketing: trigger mailings</a></i> <i><br></i> <br><br><h5>  2. Push notifications for online stores. </h5><br><br>  Push come instantly and with their help it is convenient to communicate various information to visitors of an online store.  The user has bought something - you can ‚Äúpush‚Äù him with the notification of the status of the order: paid&gt; sent&gt; will be delivered today.  Or try to make up-sell with an attractive offer of additional goods. <br><br>  <b>With the help of push-messages it is also convenient to report on new arrivals and sales, especially if you segment the audience by previous purchases.</b>  For example, a person constantly buys shoes of a certain brand.  There is a new model of the same brand and it receives such a notice.  Believe me, he will be glad and surprised.  The more this notice corresponds to the interests of the visitor, the higher the efficiency of this tool. <br><br>  <b>With regard to sales notices, then you can make a very stimulating offer with restrictions on the time and quantity of goods.</b>  Thus, it will encourage a potential client to click on the message and go to the site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea5/a07/946/ea5a079461a44b8287cb3a659d0c17da.png"><br><br>  Or, if you like this: the visitor spends more than 10 minutes on the page of a certain product and after that you send a push-notification with a 10% discount if he makes a purchase within 30 minutes.  Such trigger notifications will very effectively encourage a potential client to take a targeted action. <br><br>  And most importantly - left baskets in online stores.  The trouble of every online store.  According to statistics, visitors throw 2 baskets out of 3. Someone leaves them, as he leaves in search of cheaper prices (and there may not be any, but he will not return to you), and someone leaves the site in the process of payment. .  But in any case, he demonstrates the intention to make a purchase.  And this is something.  And you need to use it.  By any means you need to boost such a ‚Äúcushy‚Äù visitor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/087/90f/24f/08790f24fc3240a79125152ec64ff956.png"><br><br>  Usually this is done using E-mail newsletters.  And, as practice shows, a small proportion of people return to the site and complete the purchase.  <b>Push notifications are another alternative for reducing the number of baskets left.</b> <br><br>  When developing the next advertising campaign, consider the fact that push notifications are much cheaper than SMS.  This will help you to minimize the costs of transactional messages, and the visibility will be higher. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d29/651/d8f/d29651d8fdbd439e801d180868bcfa2b.png"><br><br><h5>  3. Notifications about the upcoming event </h5><br><br>  For example, about a webinar, a presentation, a concert, etc.  You can start sending notifications a month before the event, gradually telling subscribers what is new and useful they will get for themselves from the program. <br><br>  Browser push can be a great addition to a series of informative contacts.  You can send announcements in the mailing list.  And then for the most interested (clicked) send push-messages and SMS-ki.  Remember that in order to make a decision, the user needs 5-7 contacts with information about the product / service / event.  So why not improve your promotion? <br><br><h5>  4. Notifications of new blog posts </h5><br><br>  <b>Push notifications can be another way to alert subscribers about new blog posts.</b>  Thus, one more channel is added, in addition to E-mail marketing and social networks. <br><br>  <i>Article in the topic - <a href="http://boosta.ru/e-mail-marketing/kak-ne-rasteryat-vseh-klientov-na-puti-k-prodazhe-chast-1/">4 secrets of successful trigger E-mail marketing</a></i> <br><br>  This is especially true now, in conditions of excess information on the Internet.  Social networks are filled with content, it is becoming more and more difficult to get quality information from them.  Too many substandard E-mail newsletters that no one opens.  And it is very difficult to break through this blockade and make a newsletter, which will open at least a third of all subscribers. <br><br>  In such conditions, Push-notifications can add functionality to the site and attract new customers, as well as make it easier for users to subscribe to the newsletter and will always keep them up to date with news. <br><br>  Cool is that now push-notifications are available in the Russian-speaking market.  Already in November, the <a href="http://sendpulse.com/">SendPulse</a> service starts the function of sending browser push messages with the ability to create a series of notifications, personalization and segmentation.  Leave the application now and <a href="https://sendpulse.com/ru/webpush%3Futm_source%3Dboosta">get a free tariff for sending push-notifications</a> after the official launch of new features. <br><br>  For an interesting article thanks to the guys from <a href="http://sendpulse.com/">SendPulse</a> <br><br>  PS Soon on <a href="http://boosta.ru/">Boosta protest</a> "guns" <br><br>  Want your colleagues and friends to learn more about the new channel of communication with the target audience?
