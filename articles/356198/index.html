Restrictions were supposed to touch 14 areas of the central region.  After the news began to slowly creep up on Internet portals, it was immediately removed from the site. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Development of events </h3><br>  So, the news was published on the portal RT on June 20 and quietly hung at least until June 23, when it was noticed.  Those who doubt the authenticity can see it in the web archives, for example: <a href="http://bryansk.rt.ru/press/news/news24413">Bryansk</a> , <a href="http://voronezh.rt.ru/press/news/news24413">Voronezh</a> , <a href="http://tver.rt.ru/press/news/news24413">Tver</a> , <a href="http://yaroslavl.rt.ru/press/news/news24413">Yaroslavl</a> .  Or for example Google cache: <a href="https://tula.rt.ru/press/news/news24413%2B%26cd%3D1%26hl%3Dru%26ct%3Dclnk%26gl%3Dru">Tula</a> <br><br>  At first, users who contacted support received confirmation that such a restriction will be valid from July 1: <br><blockquote>  Indeed, in the Central region, <b>from 01.07.2017, amendments</b> to the contract for the provision of communication services <b>come into force</b> .  Changes are not yet valid.  <b>For most users, a 1 TB threshold will be unreachable</b> .  At the moment there is no option to increase traffic.  Please follow the news on this issue on our website. </blockquote><br>  <a href="https://vk.com/topic-14501815_28103172%3Fpost%3D61881">A source</a> <br><blockquote>  The change is applied to the Services provided by the Macro-regional branch ‚ÄúCenter‚Äù of Rostelecom PJSC and regional branches that are under its administrative and functional subordination. <br><br>  Information about additional traffic connection, at the present time, no.  I would like to note that the company does not limit the traffic, but only the speed when it reaches the consumption threshold of incoming Internet traffic in the amount of 1TB.  <b>1 TB is a very large amount.</b> <br>  You can view the traffic consumption in your personal account. </blockquote><br>  <a href="https://vk.com/topic-14501815_28103172%3Fpost%3D61905">A source</a>

We have chosen just such a volume that cannot be exceeded within the framework of one household.  According to statistics, <b>only 20-30 subscribers</b> for the entire Central Federal District <b>do not fit into this volume</b> .  This is less than 0.001%. <br></blockquote><br>  <a href="https://vk.com/topic-14501815_28103172%3Fpost%3D61948">A source</a> <br><br>  At the same time, some users began to notice the appearance on some resources of users, possibly PR people, with posts like ‚ÄúThis is fake, there is nothing on the site!‚Äù, ‚ÄúI have a wife and three children, we constantly use the Internet, but more than 20 Gigovs a month never came out "etc. <br><blockquote>  They raised a screech, got used to download and distribute pirated content in gigabytes and don‚Äôt understand that terabytes ... You were rightly told, an ordinary user is not able to download a terabyte per month, everything else requires individual consideration.  Country Freebies </blockquote><br>  <a href="https://vk.com/topic-14501815_28103172%3Fpost%3D62540">A source</a> <br>  An example on <a href="http://pikabu.ru/story/veroyatno_obyichnyiy_vbros_5148526">pikabu.ru</a> . <br><br>  And finally the tonality of technical support was as follows: <br><blockquote>  On the issue of speed limits when traffic is exceeded, sum up: the Internet for our subscribers has <b>been and remains unlimited</b> , there is no <b>traffic limit</b> .  The exception is the subscribers-individuals who illegally use our traffic, providing paid access to the Internet to other individuals. <br><br>  The wording / limitations <b>will be revised this week</b> to be more transparent and to guarantee unlimited use of the Internet for bona fide users.  The group will be separately announced next week about the return of the offer to the previous form.  We guarantee that <b>none of bona fide users will be limited in speed</b> . <br><br>  Hope for your understanding! </blockquote><br>  <a href="https://vk.com/topic-14501815_28103172%3Fpost%3D62212">A source</a> <br><br>  Those.  He promised a certain announcement explaining the situation.  At the moment (June 30) on the portal and in the Vkontakte group there is no news. <br><br><h3>  Answers from Rostelecom representatives </h3><br>  Several online publications were able to contact Rostelecom about this news. <br>  <b>June 24</b> <br><blockquote>  A representative of Rostelecom, Oleg Tarasov, said in a correspondence with vc.ru that subscribers will not face speed limits if they do not exceed the traffic volume of 1 TB <b>‚Äúsystematically‚Äù</b> .  According to him, the <b>restrictions will come into effect</b> if "the <b>excess of traffic will be permanent</b> ." <br><br>  Representatives of the operator clarified that individuals who ‚Äúillegally use traffic and provide paid access to the Internet to other individuals‚Äù may also be subject to restrictions. </blockquote><br>  <a href="https://vc.ru/n/rtk-speedcut">vc.ru: "Rostelecom" in Yaroslavl will limit the speed on unlimited home Internet tariffs</a> <br><br>  <b>June 26</b> <br><blockquote>  Rostelecom did not refuse tariffs with unlimited Internet, company spokesman Andrei Polyakov told Novaya Gazeta. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAs it was for our customers unlimited Internet, it is.  The message [on refusal from unlimited] appeared due to some misunderstanding and inaccuracy, ‚Äùhe said. <br><br>  Polyakov explained that the company found "unscrupulous subscribers who, receiving unlimited Internet, managed to transfer it to third parties." <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe tried to limit it, and not to limit unlimited Internet at all,‚Äù the spokesman said. <br><br>  He also <b>rejected the information</b> that this was somehow related to the <b>‚ÄúSpring package‚Äù</b> . </blockquote><br>  <a href="https://www.novayagazeta.ru/news/2017/06/26/132883-rostelekom-otverg-soobschenie-ob-otkaze-kompanii-ot-bezlimitnogo-interneta">Novaya Gazeta: Rostelecom has rejected a message about the company's refusal from unlimited Internet</a> <br><br><blockquote>  In the commentary ‚Äú360‚Äù Oleg Tarasov, director of the external communications department of the IRF Center, PJSC Rostelecom, said that the <b>information</b> that <b>appeared in the media is</b> nothing more than <b>misinformation</b> . <br><br>  No, we do not plan to introduce any restrictions.  The Internet for our subscribers has been and remains unlimited <br><br>  - Oleg Tarasov. <br><br>  The press service of "Rostelecom" added that restrictions on the use of the Internet apply only to individuals who illegally use traffic. <br><br>  The Internet for our subscribers has <b>been and remains unlimited</b> , there is no traffic restriction.  The exceptions are subscribers - individuals who <b>illegally use our traffic</b> , providing paid access to the Internet to other individuals. <br><br>  - press service of "Rostelecom". </blockquote><br>  <a href="http://mosday.ru/news/item.php%3F1055871">Moscow region 360: "It was and remains unlimited": in Rostelecom they denied the information on restricting the traffic of home Internet</a> <br><br>  So will there be a limit or not?  Well, we will find out tomorrow. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/356198/">https://habr.com/ru/post/356198/</a></p>
