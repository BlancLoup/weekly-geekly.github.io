      It is clear that the market decides whether people will still choose the cheapest to try or just play around, especially when it comes to the product at the price of a smartphone of the average price category.  But to make this choice more meaningful - we wrote this post. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To prevent this from being done in an ‚Äúexpensive good, cheap - bad‚Äù style, we took a few real-life examples and experiences from Fabbers engineers, and made a list of key things to keep in mind when choosing a budget 3D printer: <br><br>  Let's start with the benefits. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/84b/c5c/ff4/84bc5cff4e9c48178eb394500fdee547.png">  Price - by itself, the first and obvious advantage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/84b/c5c/ff4/84bc5cff4e9c48178eb394500fdee547.png">  Shipment and customs.  The difference in prices between ‚Äústore‚Äù printers and ‚Äúprinters from alibaba‚Äù due to the fact that the 3D printer in the TN VED falls under the category of ‚Äúnot for personal use‚Äù, i.e.  importing more than one piece has the right only to a legal entity paying a fee, which affects the price. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/84b/c5c/ff4/84bc5cff4e9c48178eb394500fdee547.png">  A large number of spare parts.  Moreover, if the printer came with a marriage, you can always try to knock out part or the entire amount of payment from the seller - this is not always easy, but it usually works. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/84b/c5c/ff4/84bc5cff4e9c48178eb394500fdee547.png">  Industry support.  Of course, there are no innovations in budget 3D-printers, and everything, from technology, to materials and software, is borrowed or ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù from ‚Äúolder‚Äù ones.  But the more cheap 3D-printers are sold, the higher are the sales and the models are more expensive - firstly, home or office 3D-printing is popular by itself, and secondly, many users, realizing that they didn‚Äôt get what they wanted, pay attention to more serious models. <br><br>  Now let's go through the weak points of "printers from Alibaba": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/44b/35a/084/44b35a0848554b02b153ed103467e413.png">  Completing.  Cheaper components reduce resistance to small shocks and vibrations.  Other weak points are moving parts: ball screws, belts, gears. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/44b/35a/084/44b35a0848554b02b153ed103467e413.png">  Extruders: material matters.  Extruders in cheap printers get clogged up quickly, they have to be constantly cleaned, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/44b/35a/084/44b35a0848554b02b153ed103467e413.png">  Work zone.  The usefulness of the printer is determined, including the size of the objects that it can produce.  The cheaper the printer, the smaller the working area. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/44b/35a/084/44b35a0848554b02b153ed103467e413.png">  Heated table.  Unfortunately, heating is not uniform in cheap technology - it keeps in the center, for example, given 100 degrees, at the edges 50-60.  As a result, large parts of the seal stick off the platform and the seal does not come out.  An example from a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/215581/">post</a> on Habr√©: <br><br><blockquote>  curve table: the center is about 1 mm below the edges - this does not allow the print height of the first layer to be set normally.  There was glass in the kit, but it touched the table only with edges - and accordingly there was a very large temperature difference in different places of the table. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/44b/35a/084/44b35a0848554b02b153ed103467e413.png">  Power supplies.  Chinese printers in our networks are waiting for a harsh reception: they have a minimum of smoothing elements that even out the jumps, which leads to stopping printing on the peaks of such jumps. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/44b/35a/084/44b35a0848554b02b153ed103467e413.png">  Assembly.  Cheap kits often have parts and components of terrible quality, as a result, they are very difficult to assemble and configure and are capricious in their work.  Chinese printers very often arrive defective, they are like Russian roulette. <br><br>  A low-cost 3D printer is now a constructor that confirms the saying ‚Äúour hands are not for boredom‚Äù.  In the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/215581/">post</a> mentioned above, everything ended well only thanks to the direct hands and a certain amount of the author‚Äôs efforts spent on bringing the printer to the mind. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/44b/35a/084/44b35a0848554b02b153ed103467e413.png">  Soft  Most 3D printers come with their own control programs.  The right manufacturers hone them, develop, provide support.  Chinese, at best, use someone else's software from normal printers, but here there is already the issue of coordinating the work of the program with the printer - the printer often loses touch, etc.  At worst, they have their own, inconvenient software, in Chinese, which for hours slices a part into layers and does it with errors, as a result, the part again fails. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/44b/35a/084/44b35a0848554b02b153ed103467e413.png">  Design.  The same argument - of course, serious manufacturers are more thoroughly working on the appearance of their gadgets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/113/36d/484/11336d484c744e5396e40165f178e849.jpg"><br>  <i><a href="http://www.fabbers.ru/magazin/3d-printers/creatr-xl/">Leapfrog Creatr XL</a> - beautiful printer and beautiful work</i> <br><br><h5>  What to do? </h5><br>  Even if the price issue is acute, buying a cheap printer has an alternative - if there is no budget for good technology - it may be worth using the 3D printer rental service - Google already gives a lot of options for Moscow, St. Petersburg and other large cities. <br><br>  But you cannot save money on children and education - therefore, it remains only to be happy for those students who this year received not cheap Chinese designers in their classes, but good, high-quality and safe equipment. <br><br> <a href="http://www.fabbers.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/75d/4b9/896/75d4b98969de4df6ae22e6e89bb150aa.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/225257/">https://habr.com/ru/post/225257/</a></p>
