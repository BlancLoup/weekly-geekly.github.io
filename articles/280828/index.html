We have a new updated book by David McFarland: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/093/081/bd0/093081bd0c904d2dbb7e1b248615b050.jpg" align="left" alt="image">  CSS3 technology allows you to create professionally designed sites, but the subtleties of this language can be quite complex, even for experienced web developers.  Completely revised the fourth edition of this book will help you take your skills in working with HTML and CSS to a new level;  it contains many valuable tips, descriptions of techniques, as well as instructions written in the style of a reference manual.  Web designers, both beginners and experienced, with the help of this book will quickly learn how to create beautiful web pages that are lightning fast and loaded on both PCs and mobile devices. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  What you need to know </h5><br>  This book assumes that you are already familiar with the HTML language.  It is understood that you have created a couple of sites (or at least a few web pages) and are familiar with the basic elements, such as html, p, h1, table, which form the basis of the hypertext markup language of documents.  CSS is useless without HTML, so you need to know how to create a simple web page using basic HTML elements.

      If you have previously created web pages in HTML, but you feel that knowledge needs to be refreshed, the next section of the book will help you. <br><br><h5>  HTML: language structure </h5><br>  In the HTML hypertext markup language, simple commands, called tags, are used to define different parts - fragments.  Below is the HTML code of a simple web page: <br><br><pre><code class="html hljs xml"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;!doctype html&gt;</span></span> <span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">html</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">&gt;</span></span> <span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">head</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">&gt;</span></span> <span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">meta</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag"> </span><span class="hljs-attr"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-attr">charset</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">=</span><span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-string">"UTF-8"</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">&gt;</span></span> <span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">title</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">&gt;</span></span>  -<span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">title</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">&gt;</span></span> <span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">head</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">&gt;</span></span> <span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">body</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">&gt;</span></span> <span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">p</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">&gt;</span></span>    -<span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">p</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">&gt;</span></span> <span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">body</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">&gt;</span></span> <span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">html</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">&gt;</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  Of course, the example is very simple, but it demonstrates all the basic elements that a regular web page needs.  In it, you will notice what is called a document type declaration - doctype, followed by an opening tag (with brackets), then the head element (head, heading section), followed by body (body, body section), and the contents of the web itself pages.  All this ends with a closing tag.  The opening and closing tags form an HTML element. <br><br><h5>  <u>Types of documents</u> </h5><br>  All web pages start with a document type declaration - a line of code defining the HTML type that you used when writing the page.  For many years, two types of documents have been used - HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0, and each of them has two styles: strict and transitional.  For example, a declaration of a transitional HTML 4.01 document type is as follows (other document type declarations for HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 look about the same): <br><br><pre> <code class="html hljs xml"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd"&gt;</span></span> <span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;!doctype html&gt;</span></span></code> </pre><br><br>  If you look at the sample code for the HTML page shown in this section, you will see that it uses the short form of the document type declaration: <br><pre> <code class="html hljs xml"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;!doctype html&gt;</span></span></code> </pre><br>  Document type declaration appeared in HTML5 language.  Compared to its predecessors, HTML5 has simplicity and rationality of use.  This book uses the HTML5 document type declaration, supported by any popular browser (even the old Internet Explorer 6).  There is no point in using ads other than the simple HTML5 doctype. <br><br>  Regardless of the preferred type of document declared by the doctype, it is important that at least one of them is advertised.  Without this, your pages will look different depending on your visitor‚Äôs browser, since browsers that do not have document type declarations as a guide display information formatted using CSS differently. <br><br>  Each document type declaration requires you to write HTML code in a specific way.  For example, the element for splitting lines in HTML 4.01 is as follows: <br><pre> <code class="html hljs xml"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">br</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">&gt;</span></span></code> </pre><br>  But in XHTML this element has the following form: <br><pre> <code class="html hljs xml"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">br</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag"> /&gt;</span></span></code> </pre><br>  And here is another advantage of HTML5: it allows the use of any of these options. <br><br><h5>  <u>How HTML elements work</u> </h5><br>  HTML elements consist of tags.  In the example above, as in the HTML code of any web page, most of the elements use pairs of tags, starting and ending with some fragment - a block of text or other commands.  Being enclosed in brackets, these tags are commands that tell the browser how to display a web page.  Tags are the markup part of the Hypertext Markup Language. <br><br>  The opening tag of each element shows the browser where the command begins, and the ending - where it ends.  The closing tag is always preceded by a forward slash (/) after the first character of the bracket (&lt;). <br><br>  On any web page, there are usually at least the following four HTML elements. <br><br>  - The very first line of the example contains the document type declaration - the doctype element, discussed in the previous section. <br><br>  - The tag is required at the beginning of the web page and (with a slash added) at the end:.  The html element tells the browser that the document is an HTML code.  The entire content of the page, including the remaining elements, is between the opening and closing tags of the html element. <br>  If we represent a web page as a tree, then the html element will be its trunk.  The two main parts of any web page ‚Äî the title section and the body ‚Äî are branches. <br><br>  - The header section of a web page (head) contains its title.  It may also contain other information that is not displayed when browsing a web page, such as a description of a page that is intended for browsers and search engines.  The heading section is the opening and closing tags of the head element. <br>  In addition, the header section may contain information used by the browser to design the HTML that is available on the page and to make the page more interactive.  You will see that the header section may contain CSS code (such as the one you will learn to create) or a link to another file containing the style sheet. <br><br>  - The body of the web page, immediately following the title section and enclosed in the tags of the body element, contains everything that should appear in the browser window: titles, text, images, etc. <br>  Inside the body of the page, as a rule, you can find the following elements: <br>  the p element is the opening tag <p>  starts the paragraph, and the closing </p>  completes; <br>  element strong - selects the text as important;  for example, code <pre> <code class="html hljs xml"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">strong</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">&gt;</span></span>!<span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">strong</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">&gt;</span></span></code> </pre>  will tell the browser that the word "Attention!" should be highlighted; <br>  element a, or an element of the binding, creates a hyperlink, when clicked, you can move to another position of the web page or to another page (you need to point the browser to this link by placing it inside the opening tag <pre> <code class="html hljs xml"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">a</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">&gt;</span></span>,  <span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">a</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag"> </span><span class="hljs-attr"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-attr">href</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">=</span><span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-string">"http://www.piter.com/"</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">&gt;</span></span> !<span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">a</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">&gt;</span></span>)</code> </pre><br>  The browser knows that when you click on the link with the words Click here!  The visitor of your page should go to the site with the address <a href="http://www.piter.com/">www.piter.com</a> .  The part of the a tag - the word href - is called an attribute, and the URL (uniform resource locator, or URL) is its value.  In this example <pre> <code class="html hljs xml">http://www.piter.com ‚Äî   href.</code> </pre><br><h5>  <u>HTML5: more elements</u> </h5><br>  HTML5, the current version of HTML, has been around for several years.  Sometimes you will hear names that are not related to HTML elements, such as local storage (a way to store data from a website on a visitor‚Äôs computer), geolocation (a way to determine the coordinates of a visitor‚Äôs computer), and drawing on a web page using WebGL.  Strictly speaking, these technologies are not part of HTML, but they relate to the new features of the browser that appeared along with HTML5. <br><br>  In this book, the term HTML5 always refers to the HTML5 document type, as well as to new elements that are part of the new HTML5 standard.  HTML5 does not bear any fundamental differences from its predecessors - its goal is to ensure that the World Wide Web continues to work as before, supporting the new needs of designers.  HTML5 has added new elements.  For example, a header element may include content that is commonly found at the top of a page ‚Äî a logo and navigation links that are common to the entire site.  The new nav element contains a set of links used to navigate the site, and the footer element contains everything that is usually placed at the bottom of the page, such as legal information, email contacts, etc. <br><br>  In addition, HTML5 has added new elements to embed video and audio content on the page, as well as new form elements that add such complex components as sliders, pop-up date selection panels, and built-in browser support for validating the data entered into the form ( which guarantees the correct filling of your forms by visitors).  Throughout the book, especially in the next chapter, you will find examples of using the HTML5 language. <br><br><h5>  <u>About this book</u> </h5><br>  This book is written to help readers of any level.  To get the most out of the material, you should definitely learn from the HTML and CSS examples provided.  If you have never created a web page before, then refer to the workshop at the end of chapter 2. The material contained in these chapters is written for those who have already mastered a little in this area and have an average level of knowledge.  If you do not know well the principles of creating web pages, then in order to better understand the topic covered, you should familiarize yourself with the text of the ‚ÄúIn the course of business!‚Äù Frame.  On the other hand, if you have a lot of experience creating web pages, pay attention to the "For advanced users" sidebar.  They contain hints, tricks and techniques for experienced programmers. <br><br>  The main sections of the book.  The book is divided into five parts.  The first four parts contain several chapters, and the last part consists of applications. <br><br>  <b>Part I. The Basics of CSS</b> .  It describes how to create cascading style sheets in general and gives a brief overview of key concepts such as inheritance, selectors, and cascading style sheets.  Along the way, learning CSS will give you basic HTML writing skills.  The workshops will consolidate the basic concepts introduced in the chapters and allow you to feel the effectiveness of using CSS. <br><br>  <b>Part II.</b>  <b>Apply CSS</b> .  Take you to the real world of web design.  You will learn the most important CSS properties and their use for text formatting, practice creating useful navigation tools and be able to enhance the look and feel of your experimental web pages by adding graphics.  You will also learn how to create simple animations using CSS.  This part also contains recommendations on how to create beautiful tables and forms. <br><br>  <b>Part III.</b>  <b>Layout pages using CSS</b> .  It will help you deal with the most confusing, but very useful CSS function: with managing the placement of elements on your page.  You will get acquainted with the design schemes (placing the content in two and three columns) and learn how to add side panels.  It will be told about two main methods of positioning elements on the page: <br>  absolute and relative.  You will also learn how to create websites that are adaptable for better perception in browsers of desktop systems, tablet computers and mobile devices, and to use flexbox, a new powerful tool for creating web page layouts. <br><br>  <b>Part IV.</b>  <b>Professional CSS layouts.</b>  Includes tips from professionals on how to improve your cascading style sheets, as well as talk about Sass, a powerful and efficient way of creating style sheets. <br><br>  <b>Part V. Appendices, including two reference books</b> .  The CSS Property Reference describes each property individually in a simple and accessible form so that you can quickly learn about the useful CSS properties that you might not have come across before, or quickly refresh the familiar properties in memory.  The second appendix describes the tools and tools for creating and applying cascading style sheets. <br><br><h5>  <u>about the author</u> </h5><br>  <b>David McFarland</b> is a web developer, teacher, and author.
