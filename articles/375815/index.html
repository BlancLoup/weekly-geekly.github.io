That is why I sigh for slow-moving internal combustion engines, there is a diploma on the wall of my room on successful completion of mechanics courses, and my favorite things are not smartphones with tablets, but knives and multitools (multi-functional tools). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A long time ago, when my friend gave me a leatherman multitool from DR, I fell in love with these devices.  The very first one fell victim to the Borseteks (and this was the most bitter loss, especially since the documents were found back by a kind person who found them), but since then I have not parted with the Lezermans. <br><br>  A small item in a leather belt case replaces a whole suitcase of tools.  My have a knife, a stroporez, a file, rulers (inch and millimeter), a saw, pliers with nippers, a can opener for cans and bottles, two screwdrivers (regular and micro) with interchangeable bits (a set of bits in a separate case), scissors, and probably something else that I forgot.  Not to mention the fact that the quality of its manufacture allows them to hammer nails and use as brass knuckles.

      The company was founded in 1983 by Timothy Leatherman and his business partner, after Timothy, on his car trips, tried with varying success to repair his old car or some current pipes in a hotel room with a pocket knife.  He perfectly managed to make a multifunctional tool that rescued me, and a huge number of people more than once.  Of course, specialized tools will usually suit better in special cases - but not carrying the same box with them, in fact.  Not everyone is to be Wassermans. <br><br>  And here it is - a <a href="http://toolguyd.com/leatherman-tread-multi-tool-bracelet-and-watch/">fundamentally new device</a> from a reputable company called Tread, i.e.  "Link" (as in the track chain).  And indeed, natural track chain.  Only stainless steel links contain 2-3 tools each - screwdrivers and hexagons.  And even in the clasp there are two tools - a screwdriver and bottle opener (and without it, as you know, any device is considered incomplete).  Only 25 tools in one bracelet - screwdrivers, hexagons, a hook for cutting ropes, a carbide tip for breaking glass. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/351/f07/a92/351f07a92a8c4f798600cc4ece12e198.jpg"><br><br>  The links are bolted with slotted heads to each other, so you can make them up as you wish, and, according to the company, adjust the length of the assembled bracelet within a quarter of an inch.  A mount allows the links to rotate freely, so screwdrivers can be used without disassembling the bracelet.  The device is coordinated with the US travel safety administration - I think that in other countries, and in particular at airports and similar high-security places, there should be no problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c4d/250/91d/c4d25091dfe142488406b3ca0d726c08.jpg"><br><br>  Moreover, you can take not just a bracelet, but Tread QM1 - a watch specially designed for it.  And then at first glance such a bracelet will look just like a metal bracelet for watches. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ee8/78b/f79/ee878bf79dec4ec2a2d98ad095a97849.jpg"><br><br>  Yes, this is not your Apple Watch.  Men's accessory - and it looks cool, and there is where to start a conversation.  All this splendor promise to release in the fall of 2015.  Bracelet for $ 150 (black version for $ 200), watch with bracelet for $ 500 (black for $ 600). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f0/27c/cfc/4f027ccfc404451cad5262984ac669fd.jpg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúAnd what,‚Äù my spouse asks, ‚Äúoften it happens that you walk down the street, and suddenly you need a screwdriver?‚Äù  Yes, - I joke back, I go, and suddenly I see something valuable - and it is screwed! ‚Äù.  In fact, situations when suddenly you urgently need some kind of tool are rare, but when they happen, it‚Äôs hard to do without a tool.  As they like to repeat in different ways: it is better if you have one, and nothing has happened, than vice versa.  So, perhaps, I will buy this bracelet.  Who knows what? <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/gp8xR07rBH4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhj3fJaZu9Ih0B3wW4aU9wvJo5xv1g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/375815/">https://habr.com/ru/post/375815/</a></p>
