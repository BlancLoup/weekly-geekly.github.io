  <section class="page js-page"><h1>On Intel places CeBIT 2012</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  They say the CeBIT exhibition is not the same as before.  Indeed, the times when all the most interesting things happened in the world of desktops, either ended, or at least are on a different turn of the history spiral.  The place for the announcement of meganows was CES, mobile devices prefer to be shown at the Mobile World Congress ... And yet, if you don‚Äôt be lazy, you don‚Äôt leave CeBIT empty-handed.  Especially if you go to the stand of Intel, who occupied the whole pavilion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/485/849/072/485849072c2ac382f8293323c53eb156.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  True, the first little sensation waited for me halfway to the stand of Intel.  It's not even that the company Gigabyte, known primarily for quality components for the PC, released two models of ultrabooks.  And not in the fact that they are working on the third-generation Intel Core processors (Ivy Bridge) that are not yet announced at the time of the exhibition.

On the first day, I still had time to read that the GeForce GT640M chip was working inside, but then the owners of the stand covered its name with a black felt-tip pen.  From sin.  Some publications were quick to say that the presence of a third-party GPU makes ultrabooks "not real", but Intel does not think so.  The position of the holder of the Ultrabook trademark is as follows: if the manufacturer manages to meet the requirements for size and battery life, then at least two GPUs can be embedded in SLI mode.  And many still succeed: the release of ultrabooks with discrete graphics have already been announced by Acer and Samsung. <br><br>  Intel itself presented a new Xeon E5-2600 server processor at CeBIT (its Moscow presentation took place on March 15).  Compared to its predecessor, the Xeon 5600, it can work 80% faster with similar power consumption.  Acceleration is achieved through the use of the Intel Advanced Vector Extensions (Intel AVX) set, which increases the number of floating point operations per work cycle up to two times when launching technical, financial, scientific and digital content development applications.  Also in the Xeon E5 appeared technology Turbo Boost 2.0, thanks to which the processor can significantly increase the operating frequency under load.  For comparison, if the core of the Xeon 5690 could "accelerate" by 266 MHz, then in the E5-2690 - as much as 900 MHz.  Of course, Xeon is unlikely to live with one of us at home (unless your home ownership originally had room for the server room in the project), but for corporate customers it is a long-awaited processor.  At a time when everything and everyone moves to the cloud, there is no excess performance, and if it is provided it is achieved with the same, or even less energy consumption ... As they say, give two containers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9a3/98b/9d6/9a398b9d68cc6e2cc325e666c119753b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Few talked about ultrabooks.  Karen Regis, who is responsible for global marketing in this direction, assured the audience that everything was going according to plan, and even demonstrated a sample running on Windows 8 with a touch screen.  They say that Lenovo had a hand in its creation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1bb/036/a91/1bb036a91ff7796f1b6e9ffa5ba50377.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For the first time since the Centrino announcement, Intel was talking about notebook accessories at the Intel presentation.  Designer Michael Michalski presented his vision of what the correct ultrabook bag should be.  The vision turned out pretty and expensive: from 700 euros per copy.  True, the agreeable Michael promised to make the version cheaper - from leatherette and factory tailoring instead of handicraft.  We hope, then it will be possible to meet the euro at 400. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/330/a9d/0c0/330a9d0c0108fb209da8ecf8bd1e2df9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/817/592/bd6/817592bd6ef039eefc8f2e19ef89b596.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Anyway expensive?  Oh, you know - how many people lay out for much less useful accessories?  In addition, I will tell you a secret - the market of bags for mobile computers in 2012 is considered to be one of the most attractive, because it is growing rapidly.  And now many new manufacturers have rushed at once to it.  And what happens when competition increases dramatically?  Exactly. <br>  And a few more words about ultrabooks.  In the huge pavilion, which occupied Intel, they allocated a separate stand for them.  See there was what. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3c0/d49/208/3c0d4920817840193823dbd24aca6416.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ee/7f5/7ab/8ee7f57abb7118cf42ec12d7b8ce5f14.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  One guy does seem to have met his dream ultrabook! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e98/92c/f66/e9892cf6656308bd10a3a2e969817422.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The branded young lady famously drove on a virtual car, and instead of the helm, she had a piece of paper with a picture of the steering wheel printed on it.  The camera of the serial Acer Aspire S3 ultrabook quite successfully tracked the movements of the image.  Should I point out that the game itself was also not on a supercomputer hidden under a false floor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f29/1cf/ed9/f291cfed98a069a15a707b93c766c4bb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ddb/0cd/9d1/ddb0cd9d11bb4c447db170ab4251f252.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Her product repeated the movement after the painted bear.  Of course, he also danced on the screen of the ultrabook. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1af/4e8/35a/1af4e835a27cc957a57bde2eb8b02aae.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Not so beautiful, but obviously more skillful guys fought in 3D-shooters and realtime strategies.  Judging by the concentration, the prizes at stake were serious. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/441/1ca/67d/4411ca67d8ed2ba38ad1646ce451ae6e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/647/643/26f/64764326f2cfbfa14798b3bfccf00a40.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Big space?  So this is on the strength of half the entire area on which Intel is located.  I would even say - a third. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/338/5c7/bfb/3385c7bfb73b4196a1f30f660f672493.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  However, something we sat up in the pavilion of Intel.  Let's step aside, turn to the left and stumble ... Well, for example, here's the beauty.  This is not just a motherboard.  This is a real computer with advanced performance and advanced top Pentium 4 (remember these? :)), but it consumes much less power.  A processor, video, four (!) Gigabit Ethernet ports, an integrated power supply, and even a place for a small SSD.  Add only memory - and that's it, you can work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3b2/75d/b82/3b275db8235ef1ed3fdc52e72ba6396d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And the size ... judge for yourself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/76d/44d/558/76d44d55845f1b42f9514ca21eea9a6f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The following picture shows the SSD with the mSATA interface, which is increasingly being used in ultrabooks.  It is quite small - chips are standard on it, like on memory modules, so you can imagine the size of the design yourself.  The volume is quite decent - up to 120 gigabytes.  That's what I will do the very thin models! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d07/47a/eb1/d0747aeb1ee04558d74255906c967f3a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But do not think that mSATA is an option only for mobile computers.  We go to the Gigabyte booth, look closely at the third-generation Intel Core motherboards ... Yes, it can not be!  They found a place for such a small SSD. <br><br>  Here, for example, gamer G1.Sniper 3 on the latest Z77 chipset.  In the lower left corner - mSATA connector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/555/162/01d/55516201d983c1756eb24c1b8d399e6e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here is a more massive model.  It does not look so severe, but the place for mSATA is not forgotten. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/311/606/13d/31160613d489441ecbf6193d4e5d10b9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And so - on all new ATX-cards.  Of course, in most cases there will be a small volume SSD, accelerating the start of the computer and reducing the time to get out of sleep.  But if one of the wealthy guys put a 120-gigabyte model, there may be enough space for the operating system.  As a result, everything is quickly and silently loaded from the SSD, and the share of the traditional hard disk remains the storage of installation files, especially ‚Äúheavy‚Äù programs and just file storage. <br>  Why all this?  Well, for example, about such a bundle, at least, nice to tell friends :) <br><br>  But seriously, the less wires in the case, the better.  SATA cables are now surprisingly frail, and, for example, in a home NAS operating around the clock, I have already changed them twice.  Therefore, transferring the SSD directly to the board not only speeds up the work, but also provides reliable contact.  Fewer wires ‚Äî easier air flow ‚Äî more efficient cooling of the HDD and other components.  So the computer will live without external intervention longer and will annoy its owner less. <br><br>  Do you personally like the presence of mSATA on the motherboard?  Or is it a whim unnecessary? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4b1/f9b/dc6/4b1f9bdc69a55fa9d8f8145d94fdc857.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At CeBIT, the series of exhibitions temporarily ends, and until Computex in June we are in for some calm.  However, Intel is unlikely to pause for so long, because in April the traditional Intel Developer Forum will be held in Beijing, and certainly not without significant announcements.  I hope to read about them in this blog, and even attend. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140087/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140087/</a></p>
