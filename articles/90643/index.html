  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Game news Planet Zhelezyaka (April change-log)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The work on our game ‚Äú <a href="http://zhe-pla.net/">Planet Zhelezyaka</a> ‚Äù [zhe-pla.net] does not stop and I would like to share an intermediate one (for I still want to make a lot of different things) with a report on fixes and changes to the game in the best, as we see it, direction. <br><br>  So, during this time, of course, not without the help of the players ( <b>for which they are very thankful</b> ), we managed to find all sorts of minor and not very good points for refinement or fix, which is natural for any project at practically any stage of development (I write on my own experience with large and not very projects of other companies).  Without helpers it is incredibly difficult to find such bugs, so once again a <b>big Respect to all who care</b> ! <br><br>  <b>List of changes / updates in the game</b> since the previous post: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  - the game originally conceived its own terminology and ‚Äúits‚Äù names of gaming items and chips, and for greater clarity and faster mastering, the <b>Glossary of</b> gaming <b>terms</b> was created in the game (there are not so many of them, by the way);

      - for those who want to understand where they are and what it is about that they created a mandatory <b>Tour for the game</b> section for any online <b>game</b> with a brief explanation of what the player on the planet will have to do;  right there are kat (cut) screenshots of the main gaming sections; <br><br>  - With the help of one of the players (as if <i>for gamer by gamer</i> ), the <b>First steps</b> section was created as a guide for novice players, which will continue to be updated and filled with explanatory graphics for greater clarity and clarity; <br><br>  - Inside the main game sections a <b>block of the Chatterer‚Äôs Advisor</b> appeared, giving practical advice and explanation of the chips in each specific section;  One piece of advice is not enough, so with the help of a listalk inside the block, you can read other tips that clarify individual game mechanisms <br><br>  - there was a problem with the receipt of letters by those who use free services (and maybe not only them) with strongly twisted "screws" of antispam filters, although this is a common situation, probably;  with this in mind, the activation scripts themselves were slightly rewritten and for such cases (when the activation letter did not <b>arrive</b> ) the <b>Reactivator was</b> made (experience has shown that in most cases a second attempt is triggered and the letter is delivered to the addressee);  if the activator did not help, then the question was resolved personally through Feedback (so that there was always a way out of the situation); <br><br>  - <b>‚Äúcosmetics‚Äù of separate game</b> sections were conducted in order to increase the information content and usability, including  these are the Archives and Drome sections; <br><br>  - <b>new game mechanisms</b> connected with robots and technologies were put into operation, namely: <br>  <b>a)</b> if earlier robots did not create special game tasks other than reprogramming / modifying into specialized robots and vice versa, now, one can say, a small revolution has taken place and robots need a certain amount of resources daily for their own content (the new game term Care ‚ÄúCaring for the mechanisms of robots‚Äù and he is also ‚Äúcaring for a piece of iron‚Äù from the common storage in the hands of robots, if you like, ‚Äúsalary‚Äù); <br>  <b>b)</b> robots that do not have enough resources for maintenance, "jammed" and become wrecked, which can immediately lead to tangible consequences in the slope (see the next subparagraph); <br>  <b>c) the</b> technology used to be simply upgraded and immediately had an effect in the increase in the steepness of the game indicators, but now each technology can be pumped through as before, but it will be as effective as it is provided by the support of professionals (specialized robots);  this added adequacy to the pumping and development of character bases, as well as gave a certain lever to the players to manage the distribution of power and toughness (and there is a sense in temporarily lowering the effect of a particular technology in the game, believe me); <br><br>  - so the chip necessary for all online toys remained in the report for the ‚Äúdessert‚Äù - this is <b>Boltalka</b> : now players can make joint evil plans or just chat about success in the game or anything else;  and that communication should not be spoiled by insults and even obscenity (although it is forbidden by the Rules of the game and can be punished), the Antimat is made in <b>Boltalka</b> , which special ‚Äúlovers‚Äù of the expanded Russian dictionary can be turned off in the account settings;  Of course, Antimat is not perfect (like everything else in the world), but it still smoothes out bumps and barbs in the players' boltologists. <br><br>  These are the main game innovations.  It is pleasant to write about the work done, but at the thought of the future work that has not yet been done, it becomes scary, because tudou sheets have a strange tendency not to decrease, but only to grow in size. <br><br>  In the meantime, work on the game continues and minds are boiling with new ideas. <br><br>  <b>Thanks for attention!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90643/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90643/</a></p>
