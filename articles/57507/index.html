    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Project Manager Nesterovskaya Asya Konstantinovna - woman carrier rocket.  She is doing everything to get out at least some funding for the project by the city - the topic is still socially significant.  In connection with this, TV reporters often come to us for reports.  On April 9, in the classroom on Nevsky, 104, an agreement was signed between the Association and the Blockade of Leningrad on the provision of premises for conducting classes in all districts of the city.  In connection with this, correspondents from RenTV and STO channels came.  Plots have already been shown on TV :) <br><br>  April 14 was 10, the anniversary lesson on Nevsky, 104, so the First Channel came.  We took classes, then we went to the office, we also took something there, and finally came to the workshop, where I and other volunteers assemble computers.  In the workshop, too, we made several entries about how we work there, and we went in a demonstrative and beautiful way to present the computer to the first student who had completed the courses.  Handed :) <br><br>  On April 16, classes were held at the central office (Admiralteysky District), and the presentation of a new computer for a computer class by Arutek Computers (which came over us, by the way, thanks to that very first post here, at the Habr√©).  All this came to shoot Channel Five :) <br><br>  A little later, lay out reports, I will give a link, if anyone is interested to see it.  I myself have done a lot of pictures, I can show them too :) <br><br>  Also, thanks to the post on Habr√©, we were given about 14 monitors, different small bundles, and one system unit.  I work in this plan and in other areas. <br><br>  In a spiritual impulse, he also wrote to a thousand-strong participant in Live Journal asking for free PR.  Pre-received agreement, we'll see the result a little later. <br><br>  However, there is no funding yet, and there is nothing to hire specialists and workers, so for the time being everything is on a volunteer basis, and if anyone wants to help a little, we will be happy :) <br><br>  What we can help now: <br>  - you need a person with a laptop and WiMAX to drive up to our workshop and walk around the rooms to check the stability of the connection - except for Avant-garde, we have nothing there, and Avant-garde for organizations will be worth a lot of money; <br>  - you need a person with a color laser printer (at work if you have one, for example) - you need to print 20-30 pieces of advertising A4 to distribute to visitors and potential sponsors; <br>  - we need people with vehicles - I don‚Äôt have a car, and for those who give it, I have to collect equipment with great difficulty.  Fortunately, for the time being, all who give away from me are within walking distance and tram reach.  At least once a week, call in to two or three people, pick up on a different monitor, and throw us at 10 Krasnoarmeyskaya - we will be very grateful. <br><br>  In the future, you will need help: <br>  - in teaching; <br>  - in technical support of classes - a class is planned even in Kolpino, and there you don‚Äôt wind up especially, you will need a person from there; <br>  - in logistics - to organize the export of delivered equipment.  If there are more returns, you will have to think through the best routes and coordinate them with people in order to take them from several places at once. <br><br>  If the city still gives financing, there will even be some compensation, but I cannot promise this 100% :) <br><br><br>  Well, traditionally, we will be glad to any component parts - I have a pensioner who even attaches the first pentiums to familiar pensioners, who, apart from riveting pieces of paper in Word'97, need nothing more, even the Internet :) <br><br>  You can call during business hours by calling 575-13-73.  If you do not pick up the phone, or answer the fax, you can call +7 (950) 022-56-77.
