The adventures of the Runet assault in the partisan country</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  March 10-14, 2014 there was a large-scale conference ‚ÄúBynet‚Äôs Week.  Awakening ‚Äù, in which reports on the situation in the .BY zone itself were made by speakers from Moscow.  I will try not to overload the story with a detailed report on the event itself: videos, presentations and photographs are mass, some of them will be published before the end of the week.  The topic of this note is the Belarusian Internet itself as it is seen from the RU zone in spring 2014 and the impression of the first visit to the country. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Prehistory </h4>

      The Belarusian Internet has always developed, focusing on the Runet. <br>  If Internet cafes appeared in Russia, then Minsk follows this fashion. <br>  If in Moscow a long-distance telephone station number 9 was chosen as the traffic exchange point, after which the historical name M9-IX appeared, then the traffic exchange point in Belarus was named BY-IX, just to be the same as in Moscow. <br>  If we have the ‚ÄúRussian Internet Forum‚Äù, then in response - the ‚ÄúBelarusian Internet Forum‚Äù, which, however, stopped to be held in the second half of the 2000s. <br><br>  As for Internet users in Belarus, according to Gemius, today their number is 4.9 million (with a population of 9.3 million).  And the growth of the new audience slowed down for natural reasons. <br><br>  In 2013, the Belarusian ruble did not sharply fall in price, and the forecasts for the growth in the market of Internet advertising and online commerce by one and a half times, apparently, were confirmed. <br><br>  Almost 100,000 websites in the national domain zone .BY were expected to be registered on New Year's Eve, however, the one hundred thousandth domain was symbolically registered at the end of the Bynet Week. <br><br>  However, Bynet is ‚Äúdevoured‚Äù by Runet.  A little more: Belarusians will only look for work on Runetov's websites, buy real estate in their cities on Russian websites, etc. Belarusian social networks have been opened vseti.by, i.tut.by, kollega.by, face.by, parta. by ... However, the most visited sites by Belarusian users: Vkontakte, Odnoklassniki and leading global players, and all of them overtake Tut.by.  Ten resources have 95% coverage of the Belarusian audience (among them: tut.by, onliner, mail.ru, vk.com, Wikipedia, YouTube, Google). <br><br>  Since 2010, Bynet has been looking for his gauge, and in panel research he seems to have found him in the form of Gemius Belarus.  Their "Statistics of the Belarusian Internet audience": <br>  The main age is 25-35 years (29%) <br>  35% have higher education <br>  40% have an income of $ 250 or more (50% of the audience with an income of $ 600 live in Minsk) <br>  93% go online from home <br>  Soc.  media use 72% <br>  Resources with video content - 49% <br>  Weather Sites - 30% <br>  Car sites - 26% <br>  News sites - more than 40% <br>  Sports sites - 12%. <br><br>  Marketing.by reported in the first conference report the results of a survey: 69% of website developers provide SEO services at the same time. <br>  7% of development companies are over 10 years old. <br>  $ 5 million is an assessment of the development market in Bynet in 2013 and 2012. Apparently, this assessment has something to do with the actual state of affairs. <br><br>  After the first two years of work in Bainet, specialists of any profile begin to look for a better life, and you can guess in which domain zone they find themselves most often. <br><br>  Therefore, in Bynet, there is interest not only to the Runet, but also specifically to its leaders.  At the first Yandex seminar in Minsk, more than 800 people crowded into a room with a capacity of approximately 700 seats.  It was a record for all non-Moscow conferences of Yandex. <br>  If in the zero years, the yandex.by domain was not even registered, then at present Yandex has about a hundred employees in the Minsk office, and the vast majority are not sales managers at all. <br><br><h4>  State aid </h4><br><br>  It‚Äôs not for me to explain to you, but I want this chapter to remain for those who will get into this article from search engines. <br><br>  At the end of 2010, Alexander Lukashenko visited the High-Tech Park and was unhappy with the work done, or rather, the work that was not done.  He demanded to complete the construction of the High-Tech Park in Minsk by the end of 2013, because five years after the publication of the decree on the High-Tech Park, he then reconstructed only one building. <br>  Now the park, which has on its website <a href="http://www.park.by/post-cultural_proximity_mentality/%3Flng%3Dru" rel="nofollow">pages on the national mentality</a> and on the <a href="http://www.park.by/post-754/%3Flng%3Dru" rel="nofollow">irrelevance of national specifics in IT</a> , seems to be already working with might and main (at least it seems so from the side of wires). <br><br>  At the same time, the national specificity of the national zone of the network is also manifested in the fact that Russians can‚Äôt laugh at jokes on bash.org.by by no means always: they probably also have something state-specific in them. <br>  @mojo_fm: ‚ÄúMinsk teachers are planning a strike demanding a reduction in salaries for programmers.‚Äù  And where is the word "shovel"? <br><br>  Decree No. 60 of the President of the Republic of Belarus ‚ÄúOn measures to improve the use of the national segment of the Internet‚Äù, to put it simply, prescribes hosting in Belarus for local Internet projects.  And in the report of Leonid Filatov at another conference in Minsk, in the fall of 2013, a slide with the study of Openstat was shown, where an unprecedented hosting patriotism of Belarusian sites was demonstrated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/99a/ce8/ad3/99ace8ad3e94a9de0e66b1d51b032918.png" width="500" height="368"><br><br>  The penalty for failure to comply with Decree No. 60 does not provide for blocking the violator or suspending business activities.  Sanctions are just fines. <br><br>  By the way, Wi-Fi in Belarus - on the passport.  But there is.  But there are so few ATMs that Muscovite is just "hurts the eyes." <br><br>  The Republican Unitary Telecommunication Enterprise Beltelecom is a provider for the Belarusian people. <br>  Provider for respectable gentlemen is the operator of Velcom (about which for some reason they speak as about the daughter of ‚ÄúMegaphone‚Äù?).  He also owns the domain privet.by, which gave the title of the article. <br><br><h4>  Belarusian users and Belarusian sites 2014 </h4><br><br>  Alexander Sadovsky, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/yandex/">Yandex</a> , and Andrei Travin, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/openstat/">Openstat</a> , the author of these lines, made overview reports on the Bynet at the conference - to tell local people about it (I don‚Äôt know if they needed it, but I know that there‚Äôs no one else indeed, even Tut.by in recent years has stopped reporting the number of sites in its catalog). <br><br>  Neither Yandex nor Openstat received from Hoster.by the full current 100 thousand domains database.  Both companies have requested in advance.  Both were refused with reference to administrative difficulties (see previous chapter).  Both somehow managed: Yandex, I believe, was able to find the missing sites by reference, and Openstat, ‚Äúcalling‚Äù 85,000 domains of the .BY with its crawler, received the answer ‚Äú200‚Äù (Ok) for 63 thousand sites, while Hoster.by estimates the number of ‚Äúlive‚Äù sites to 65 thousand. Since all the reports were made for ‚Äúlive‚Äù domains, with comprehensive research here, too, everything is Ok. <br><br>  If the reader turns out to be from the Russian business, I warn you in advance that there is a bit of (potential) money in this knowledge - they part with caution and reluctantly in Bynet.  For example, to achieve a monthly budget for the promotion of $ 5 thousand is possible only for years hilling the Belarusian client with budgets of a smaller order. <br><br>  Alexander Sadovsky said that in the Belarusian zone of the network are noted: <br>  9 million requests per day, 6 requests per user <br>  25% - watch, play, download <br>  14% - commercial <br>  15% - queries about social.  network <br>  6% - porn. <br><br>  Demand in Belarus becomes similar to Russian <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/77f/4da/0df/77f4da0df87fb4a0412242810f73bc25.png" width="800" height="418"><br><br>  According to Yandex.Market, the average bill <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bb3/7e2/bc1/bb37e2bc16b2c2b4751c62e07af7d878.png" width="717" height="334"><br><br>  According to the <a href="https://www.openstat.ru/service">Openstat</a> research, the Internet statistics market in Belarus is as follows. <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/machomachomacho/view/517100/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/826/68f/e2b/82668fe2b8eaa73427f192270461d253.png" width="800" height="450"></a> <br><br>  At the same time, we managed to catch the trend: a change of the leader in Internet statistics.  For the second pages, it happened a month earlier. <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/machomachomacho/view/517099/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e85/6c0/d1c/e856c0d1cfcaec03236858faaa3a9d77.png" width="800" height="450"></a> <br><br>  A total of 550 .BY sites belong to advertising, marketing and PR (offline and online).  Among them, Ashmanov‚Äôs categorizer used in the study identified only 5 web design studios.  The result, which looks like a mistake, is in fact even overpriced.  In fact, there are only three designer web studios left on the Belarusian Internet, and all of them were presented at the round table of the first day of the ‚ÄúBynet Week‚Äù conference. <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/machomachomacho/view/517097/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/24f/f62/bee/24ff62beed6c6e75d25ad643516b80a3.png" width="800" height="390"></a> <br><br>  The full research presentation is available on a <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/andrey_travin/openstat-bynet">personal</a> or <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Openstat/openstat-bynet-32394375">corporate</a> account.  It includes reference research to identify search marketing trends, Internet advertising, Internet statistics, website engines (CMS), Share on Social Networking buttons, distribution of maps to the website and online consultants in Belarus. <br>  <a href="http://seopult.tv/programs/moneymaking/openstat_otkryto_analizirujte/">Details about the technique</a> (video).  This link is given on the final slide. <br>  You can read more about the methodology <a href="http://research.cmsmagazine.ru/rezultaty-monitoringa-rasprostranennosti-cms/">in the introduction to this article</a> . <br><br><h4>  Awakening 2014 </h4><br><br>  One and a half thousand people took part in the paid conference in Bynet.  A third of them had a four-day subscription, which cost about 5 thousand Russian rubles, which for Moscow is the price of the cheapest one-day events. <br>  I would not be too lazy to look at the <a href="http://bynetweek.by/by2014/agenda/" rel="nofollow">program of the event</a> .  After all, even if you run through it on the wheel of a ‚Äúmouse‚Äù, you can see an impressive landing party of Runetovskiy speakers, especially - four from Yandex. <br><br>  Organized and held the "Week ..." Director of WebCom Group Denis Guryev.  It is necessary to be generous in order to start a conference, which will be minus, and receive guests from Moscow, Simferopol, Dublin and Kiev in order to wake up Bynet. <br>  My opinion is this: Alexander Sadovsky did not plan in advance that it would be Denis Guriev who would be asked to turn off the reference ranking in Moscow.  He just wanted to make Denis happy by the results of his acquaintance with such a megaphone. <br><br>  Belarus ranks third in the world for sanctions.  Probably because of this in the "President-Hotel" guests are served only instant coffee?  Anyway, not hoping for the invigorating effect of the brown burda, every morning of the conference Denis tried to make him awake with the masked models and professional dances on the stage before the first reports. <br><br>  The weather, however, also favored the initiative.  On March 9 and 10, temperature records were recorded in Minsk, and on March 11-14, there was excellent sunny warm weather.  Spring came with the conference. <br>  And the next day, while the organizers were sleeping, there were strong winds in Belarus, because of which 1,309 settlements were de-energized in the country, 41 roofs were blown off. <br>  Awakening happened.  But only for how long? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/216407/">https://habr.com/ru/post/216407/</a></p>
