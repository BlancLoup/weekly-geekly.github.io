Today we will talk about the first startup in its niche to find government and commercial tenders and IT procurement. <br><br>  Today, no company has a desire to independently assemble a computer for itself, as it was in the 80s.  But the need to purchase, at least computers, arises in every modern organization.  And the more developed a company, the more developed and more complex its IT infrastructure: computers, servers, software, network, communication services and much more. <br><br>  For effective maintenance, operation and development of the IT infrastructure "zoo", a reasonable division of functions between its own staff and IT partners is necessary.

      Whom to choose to supply the necessary products, implement projects or provide services?  Who is suitable for this, and with whom it is better not to get involved?  Who has the best price / quality ratio for your chosen priorities? <br><br>  Services <a href="http://erumpo.ru/">www.erumpo.ru</a> will help you with the decision of the problem of choice.  You will be able to improve the quality of choice of new IT partners, and also make your choice faster and more economically than your competitors. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Read more about the benefits. <habracut><br><br><h5>  First of all </h5><br><br>  A distinctive advantage of erumpo is the availability of information on typical projects in which an IT provider can potentially participate.  A typical project in terms of erumpo is: <br><ul><li>  sale of any products; </li><li>  production of any products; </li><li>  provision of services, both temporary (for example, assistance in the implementation of IT systems) and permanent (for example, follow-up support). </li></ul><br><br>  Data on a typical project, in which a potential supplier is ready to take part, contain: the name of the project, a brief description, the categories of the project, the conditions necessary for its start, the stages of the project, the roles necessary for its implementation, and the results obtained.  This information allows even before direct communication with the supplier to assess whether it is suitable for the supply of necessary products, the implementation of any projects or the provision of any services. <br><br><h5>  Secondly </h5><br><br>  A distinctive advantage of erumpo is that all IT providers who register on the resource are motivated, first of all, to search for new customers, and not to something else.  To support this, erumpo provides IT suppliers with absolutely free information on all tenders and purchases available on the Russian market today, aggregating this data from ~ 70 state and commercial sites (among them zakupki.gov.ru, sberbank-ast, roseltorg, b2b -energo, telecom companies, banking sector, industrial and energy sectors). <br><br><h5>  Thirdly </h5><br><br>  A distinctive advantage of erumpo is that the company operates only in a strictly delineated niche - information and high technology.  This allows you to focus on the quality of information and make all information services as convenient as possible. <br><br><h5>  Fourth </h5><br><br>  In order to make the choice of suppliers quick, convenient and cost-effective, erumpo has a number of services that allow even before direct communication with suppliers and as soon as possible to find out real information about the conditions that they are ready to offer (including the cost and delivery time or work) .  This is achieved by a simple analysis of commercial offers received from IT suppliers, which are formed on the basis of their previously created standard projects and contain: the name of the commercial offer, its brief description, the conditions necessary for the start of cooperation, the stage of implementation and their duration, the roles necessary for performance, and their cost, resulting from the performance of the work results. <br><br>  You can learn more about the services provided by erumpo for companies searching for IT partners here - <a href="http://www.erumpo.ru/demo/customer/">www.erumpo.ru/demo/customer</a> and with the services that erumpo provides to IT providers here - <a href="http://www.erumpo.ru/demo/">www.erumpo.ru/demo</a> </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112008/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112008/</a></p>
