  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How did you manage to make friends with the TP-LINK router and mobile devices</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Has anyone encountered a problem with WiFi by connecting via devices with Android or Symbian?  I've met here.  True, for me this is not new - before there was trouble with the PDA on which Windows Mobile 5 stood - he completely refused to work with WPA / WPA2 right before flashing to the latest firmware from WM 6.5, but it didn‚Äôt work with any access points.  But the Nokia 5800 smartphone with Symbian 9.4 on board and the AirPad X10 tablet with Android 2.3.1 have never crashed while working over WiFi with WPA or WPA2 security.  Until yesterday, when I had to install TP-LINK TL-WR741N router.  Making this miracle work in routing mode with auto-connection via L2TP was possible without problems.  WiFi connection was tested with WPA / WPA2 PSK security mode and AES encryption, for which a wireless connection was created on a netbook with Lubuntu 11.10, which rose from half a ping and in a few seconds the browser displayed the home page - Google.  But later, when I tried to connect to the Internet via a Symbian smartphone, I received the error ‚ÄúInvalid server name‚Äù, but Android simply said that the remote server was not available, although the signal level was good, but the connection indicator was not green (the Internet connection was established successfully ), and white (‚Äúthe network is not yet available‚Äù). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first thing that began to poke - the channel.  Automatically I installed the 1st channel, and although there were no other points in the zone, I still changed it - to no avail.  Then I tried to change the mode from the default setting ‚Äú11bgn mixed‚Äù to different variations 11b / 11g - the result is exactly the same.  WDS and QSS were disabled, everything is in order. <br>  Judging by the data of the router, the packets from the devices it receives - the number of received packets grows with each new attempt to ‚Äúget through‚Äù.  But the packets sent by the router are always 4. <br>  The assumption that had arisen was that the matter in the DNS had to be swept away - especially since it was also impossible to reach the remote server via IP.  Why are there before the remote server - the WiFi web interface itself could not be reached. <br>  Updating the firmware of the router to the latest version did not change anything. <br>  Testing the connection in the first place from a smartphone with Symbian, I also tried to disable the network security, but the problems remained the same: it connects to the dot, and then it doesn't.  But when I finally thought of checking the connection to the open network on Android, it turned out that for him the problem was just safe.  As a result, switching from automatic WPA / WPA2 to WPA2 mode specifically - the issue was solved in the best way. <br>  Here are the times! <br>  Now there was only Symbian.  It was already more difficult with him - it seems like all the wireless settings have already been checked ... And then a thought occurred to me: check DHCP. <br>  As it turned out, IP addresses from the pool were issued starting from the 100th.  In principle, nothing particularly criminal, but ... After changing the beginning of the pool of addresses to 192.168.1.2, the smartphone immediately stomped along the URL I suggested and finally connected to the remote server! <br>  Such is the magic of the router.  And no David Blaine. </div>
