      <b>Warface</b> is a multiplayer online shooter distributed by <b>Free2Play</b> model.  Under the cut I will give a small squeeze of information about the game and about the developers.  If you are interested in more detailed information, then it is better to immediately go to the <a href="http://wf.mail.ru/">official website of Warface in Russia</a> .  Better yet, <a href="http://wf.mail.ru/download">download the game</a> and see everything with your own eyes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Free2play </h4><br>  All the main game content in Warface is provided free of charge, but those who find this not enough will be able to purchase additional items such as cooler weapons, equipment and various equipment for real money.  All of the above can be purchased for in-game points.  There are three types of currency in the game: <br><ul><li>  warbax - earned in battle </li><li>  loans - currency received for real funds </li><li>  crowns - special points for group missions </li></ul><br>  Earn crowns is the hardest, so the items purchased for this currency, have the highest rates. <br><br><h4>  About the game </h4><br>  I will tell you very briefly about the game itself, since <a href="http://wf.mail.ru/guide">everything is described in sufficient detail</a> on the <a href="http://wf.mail.ru/guide">off-site</a> . <br>  Warface has two game modes - PvE and PvP.  Each mode in turn includes several different types of missions \ modes for every taste: <br><br><h5>  PvE </h5><ul><li>  boss murder - the mission goal is to kill a strong and dangerous opponent </li><li>  arena - defense at one point from the advancing enemy units </li><li>  Safari - following to the helicopter on the transport shelled from all sides </li><li>  escort - escorting equipment to a safe point </li></ul><br><h5>  PvP </h5><ul><li>  team battle - standard mode for any online shooter </li><li>  assault - battle for control points </li><li>  undermining - a familiar regime with the installation and undermining of a bomb </li><li>  meat grinder - everyone fights for himself </li><li>  capture is also a familiar flag capture mode </li><li>  destruction - to achieve victory in this mode in two ways: three times to strike from the air at enemy positions or to destroy 120 enemies.  To trigger an air strike, you must hold the control point located in the center of the map. </li></ul><br>  There are three levels of difficulty in PvE mode: <ul><li>  easy (training) </li><li>  complicated </li><li>  Pro (award x2) </li></ul><br>  PvE-missions with a level of complexity "Complex" and "Pro" are updated every day at 4 am Moscow time.  Training mission, in my opinion, does not change. <br><br>  The game has a division of soldiers by specialization - a medic, engineer, attack aircraft and sniper.  Each class has its advantages and disadvantages.  Naturally, to perform complex PvE missions, a well-coordinated game of all classes is important. <br><br>  The developers have added to the game a diverse arsenal of weapons, among which almost all types of weapons are represented - from pistols to sniper rifles.  Also, as already mentioned, you can buy a variety of equipment and equipment, for example, silencers, scopes, podstvolniki, etc. <br><br>  And, of course, in the game there are achievements, titles, patches and clans - in general, everything that you can show off to your friends.  By the way, the developers didn't forget about the gaming friend list either. <br><br><h4>  About development </h4><br>  The developer is the world-famous company Crytek, famous for such single projects as Far Cry, Crysis 1 and Crysis 2. In Warface ( <i>there is no ‚ÄúCry‚Äù in the name ?!</i> ), the same engine is used as in Crysis 2 - this is already received many awards CryENGINE3. <br><br>  Work on the project goes simultaneously in three studios of the company - Kiev, Frankfurt and Seoul.  The main work is carried out in Kiev, and the Seoul and Frankfurt offices provide assistance in creating the game.  The developers from Kiev quite actively lead a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPL8743ABB4EB12F51F%26feature%3Dplcp">video blog in Russian</a> , in which they talk a lot about the intricacies of the game, the history of its creation, what was created and how they answer users' questions. <br><br>  On December 16, it became known that Mail.Ru Group would be involved in publishing the game in Russia, and already on March 1, the start of accepting applications for the closed beta testing of Warface was announced.  Already at the PTA, the game showed tremendous results - there were so many people who wanted to get acquainted with the shooter that they had to connect more than 20 additional servers. <br><br>  In addition to publication, the task of Mail.Ru includes complete localization of the game into Russian.  The actor Maxim Averin and the famous TV presenter Lera Kudryavtseva were invited for the dubbing.  Localization, in my opinion, in general, came out very worthy.  Good emotional voice, the interface is also very well translated, with the exception of a few small nuances that are likely to correct the release. <br><br><h4>  Links </h4><br>  <a href="http://wf.mail.ru/">http://wf.mail.ru/</a> - the official website of the game in Russia <br>  <a href="http://wf.mail.ru/forums/forum.php">http://wf.mail.ru/forums/forum.php</a> - official Russian forum <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPL8743ABB4EB12F51F%26feature%3Dplcp">Official Russian YouTube channel</a> <br><br><h6>  Communities </h6><ul><li>  <a href="http://futubra.com/warface">Futubra</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://my.mail.ru/community/warface/">My world</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/warface_game">In contact with</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/warfaceru%3Fsk%3Dwall">Facebook</a> </li></ul><br><br>  Good luck everyone! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142138/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142138/</a></p>
