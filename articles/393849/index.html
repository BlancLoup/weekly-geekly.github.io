  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The GeoOrbital Wheel will turn an ordinary bicycle into an electric one</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Electric bicycles, electric scooters, electric scooters and other means of individual movement with the prefix "electric" - it is convenient, practical, safe, environmentally friendly.  It would seem that each of the form factors offered today has long been approved and has proven itself well among its audience.  But, apparently, sometimes the desire to invent another version of the wheel turns out to be stronger and something like GeoOrbital appears - a wheel that turns an ordinary bicycle into an electric one.  Like many similar projects, the development masters its audience on Kikstarter and, I must say, masters quite successfully. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/220/016/602/2200166024d9d7ca78b60fb3877f911d.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Project managers and development co-authors are two former employees of SpaceX and Ford, which allows the end user to hope for a rational grain in the project and a responsible approach to detail.  At the same time, experts from Cambridge, MIT and Harvard Universities played a key role at all stages of development and testing.  All structural components are made in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, which, according to the authors GeoOrbital, ensures the quality of the finished solution. <br><br>  The GeoOrbital electric wheel offered to our attention serves as a replacement for the front standard wheel of almost any bicycle model with a tire diameter of 26 or 28-29 inches.  Here you should immediately pay attention to the advantages of GeoOrbital, such as strength - the tire does not lose its performance even when it is punctured.

High-quality removable lithium-ion batteries Panasonic 36V are installed on GeoOrbital, providing a range of 30 km without using pedals, and up to 80 km in combined mode.  If necessary, you can always grab a compact spare battery with you and double the available trip distance. <br><br>  Of the obvious advantages of the solution is a quick and easy installation that allows you to part with the need to manually transport the bicycle (and, especially, the electric bike) to the upper floors.  In a number of bicycles with an electric wheel still remains a bicycle, does not require licensing, insurance and registration in the road control service.  Although in the general case, of course, the specifics of the effect of restrictions and permits correlate with the requirements of local legislation. <br><br>  The cost of GeoOrbital cannot be called a gift - even at the stage of pre-orders the wheel will cost $ 650 and for this money it is quite possible to choose an excellent electric bike from a proven manufacturer.  The selling price in retail with the start of massive sales will reach $ 950. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/31f/2f0/7f3/31f2f07f35e5a5756f5a48ac6a1a2080.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The wheel has a built-in USB outlet that allows you to charge your phone, bicycle lights or speaker.  By itself, a removable battery will perfectly cope with the role of an additional backup power source where it may be needed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2dc/2a8/554/2dc2a8554cb07d25938b4fd4a6c5743b.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  It is not an exaggeration to say that the electric wheel GeoOrbital certainly has certain advantages in comparison with the standard solution.  But how much these advantages are justified by the price of such a gadget - here the question remains open.  Nevertheless, even now, with the stated goal of $ 75,000, the company collected more than $ 300,000 on the platform. And the first deliveries, which are likely to take place, are scheduled for November 2016. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d25/4ed/cbe/d254edcbea2400c651d307e1a0ea7b44.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i><sub><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1266381423/geoorbital-wheel-make-your-bike-electric-in-60-sec">A source</a></sub></i> <br><br>  That's all, with you there was a simple service for choosing sophisticated <a href="https://dronk.ru/">Dronk.Ru</a> equipment.
