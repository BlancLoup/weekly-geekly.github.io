Everyone knows various events like E3, IgroMir, KRI and the like.  Indie games to get there is almost impossible, and the cost of participation will be prohibitively high! <br><br>  Well, there is a solution!

I will definitely fly there with my project (who remembers my couple of ‚ÄúTower Defense do-it-yourself‚Äù articles?).  The pleasure is not cheap, but since you have given a free ticket, why not fly?  But now it's not about DevGAMM'e - it‚Äôs already everyone knows who is interested in this topic. <br><br>  It is not the first year when a friend <a href="http://starcon.pro/">invites you to the starcon.pro</a> event.  If earlier I refused in every way in view of my location, and I didn‚Äôt represent my place at this event, then this year I will have to think seriously.  The fact is that this year Starcon announced the creation of a zone for independent developers.  The idea is good and very tempting.  Ideally, it is seen as a CWI for independent developers, where we will be given the opportunity to entertain the people, and at the same time introduce them to our own project, standing opposite our own game stand.  On the whole, the overall orientation of the event is captivating, but this is not the point. <br><br>  How much does it cost?  And is it worth it?  For most independent developers, this journey may seem too expensive, but let's count. <br><br>  The most difficult thing in this business is to find the best option.  The purse is more like a black hole, you put money into it, and they disappear from there somewhere.  But let's not talk about sad things, let's finally consider. <br><br>  The cheapest ticket from a residence to St. Petersburg by plane will cost me almost 15,000 p.  (round-trip from Ekaterinburg).  To put it mildly, the sum is not small, but quite feasible.  Travel time is a little less than three hours. <br><br>  There is a more economical option - the train, round-trip road will cost 8000 p.  On the way I will spend almost two days, which means the smell of grilled chicken and alcoholic scent is provided to me absolutely.  The option is not the most comfortable, but more economical.  What can not be attributed to the minuses, because the difference is almost twofold! <br><br>  Accommodation in St. Petersburg (excluding food) with reservation made in advance, about 2500r night.  Considering the fact that it is desirable to arrive in advance, in order to set up a stand and meet with the organizers - you will have to fly in / arrive in advance, at least one day before the event.  Total for accommodation (and this is 2 nights), you need to postpone another 5,000 forever red.  Yes, it will not be a luxury hotel, but a hostel for me for such purposes will be enough. <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/70951535&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhll6Sx-9QTH_2-0TvMYiUDNHqigA" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Starcon 2013 # 1" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Stand!  The most weighty and costly unit of the entire trip.  But the most interesting part of it! <br><br>  I will explain why.  What is a stand for?  That's right - to attract attention, and clearly communicate about yourself and the project.  I, unfortunately, are not EA and not Activision, and I have no money for beautiful photo models.  Yes, and doroguyu scenery, with my indie project, just do not pull.  Therefore, we must look for more affordable options.  And this is a print backdrop.  Vinyl background with inscriptions, a typical photo angle at any festival.  Calling the nearest stores, I found out that it would cost me a good 5,000 rubles to buy a vinyl background.  And this is the cheapest option.  Not bad, but it's not 45000r, for not the coolest decoration.  But here's a bad luck, he also has to carry him with him, and there will be plenty of hand luggage without him.  Exit one to use a courier service like DHL.  Calling there I learn that transportation will cost 12000r.  This option does not suit me for sure.  We'll have to look for and negotiate with the workshops on site, the benefit in the Internet era is not so difficult.  We assume that the backdrop will cost me thousands in 7000r, if I order it in the St. Petersburg workshop.  But one backdrop will obviously not enough.  It is necessary to show dear players what they need to play!  Need a technique!  Desirable a lot of equipment! <br>  There are two ways to solve the problem: <br>  1) Rent.  Having rummaged on the Internet, a quite suitable option was found to take a couple or three of HP ProBook 4520S I5, (a worthy piece of iron, and in all respects suits) for 2 days.  The money will be about 3200r (2 laptops) and 5000r (3 laptops).  Again, the price is quite reasonable.  But why when have friends? <br>  2) Take from friends.  Save - so full!  I asked around from friends, and they are ready to provide several cars, for the sake of my noble turkey goal. <br><br>  Since I am an Indian, you must be an Indian to the end!  Resolved - take the iron from friends! <br><br>  Let's sum up.  The total amount does not include rental equipment! <br>  26 000 rubles if flying by plane. <br>  20 000 rubles if the train to get. <br><br>  That's how much it costs to attend a turkey KRI!  I just have to decide on this journey after DevGAMM :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/39c/b6b/76c/39cb6b76c600aedde3ca384dcf2f3f15.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As a conclusion, I want to express my immense gratitude to Habrahabr!  Thanks to you, the voices were collected on the greenlight and my project will receive a green light.  Now I am working on integrating it with the Steam API.  See you at DevGAMM, and then at Starcon! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/221611/">https://habr.com/ru/post/221611/</a></p>
