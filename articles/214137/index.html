Most Octa Core devices use the big.LITTLE architecture, in which at any given moment either a block of productive or a block of energy efficient cores functions.  MT6592, by contrast, can work in any configuration, including all eight simultaneously. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/485/313/d2b/485313d2b276032fb2e215193766acaa.jpg"><br><br>  Devices operating on the MT6592, massively went on sale by the end of 2013.  Now there are already enough smartphones on the market with this processor, but we decided to review the most popular and stylish among them.  Meet the "iron man" - ThL T100s. <br>  His first batch was only 2000 devices!  Exit T100 in China caused such a huge stir, that the entire batch was bought out in just 9 minutes!  The Ironman version already has our communication standards, GSM and WCDMA.  New T100S - really except as a flagship, can not be called.  This is one of the most productive Chinese devices to date.  But first things first! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="ff9c00">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS</font> </h2><br>  At the heart of the ThL T100S is an 8-core MT6592 processor with a frequency of 1.7 GHz, while the amount of RAM is 2 GB, and the internal one is 32 GB, and there is a slot for memory cards.  The display has FHD resolution and is protected by third-generation Corning Gorilla Glass.  In addition, the smartphone was equipped with 13 megapixel cameras from Sony, two SIM slots, a 2300 mAh battery, OTG and NFC functions, and Android 4.2.2 is responsible for the work.

If before the logo was similar to HTC, now it is unique.  Thus, apparently, the company decided to emphasize the uniqueness of its smartphone, because before the device looked more like clones of other famous smartphones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fbe/efd/309/fbeefd3094cfc3c8ccf08d5d44992007.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to the smartphone, the kit includes: a charger with a plug for our sockets, a USB cable, a wired headset, protective film and documentation in English and Russian.  AND GUARANTEE CARD!  In the Russian representation.  For a year, at first, only the ticket must be registered on the website <a href="http://pwwarranty.com/">pwwarranty.com</a> This is already really high-quality service from the Pandawill store! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/42e/04d/cea/42e04dcea7251edf0fa246a473939377.jpg"><br><br>  The output charging current is 1 A. The smartphone can be charged both from the mains and from the computer using a USB cable.  Full recharging takes about 3 hours.  In addition, already neatly glued the factory one film on the screen.  Headset budget, for high-quality listening to music is not suitable. <br><br><h2>  <font color="ffd800">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">DESIGN, DIMENSIONS, CONTROL ELEMENTS</font> </h2><br>  The body is made of polycarbonate, which is now popular.  Such material allows to achieve maximum strength and solidity, but it is not prone to collecting scratches and prints.  Monolithic glass is made flush with the other elements.  Metal inserts are located above and below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b3/3e5/c74/2b33e5c743e95aa1ca2225d1ecaa6421.jpg"><br><br>  The front camera and voice speaker are traditionally located at the top of the front panel.  In addition, there are placed sensors of lighting and distance.  There is also an indicator that only flashes red when the battery is low and constantly on when charging.  About calls and SMS alerts do not show. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/df9/aae/897/df9aae89763261974bb24280052ddfa3.jpg"><br><br>  Touch buttons without illumination are combined with the color of the smartphone.  With excellent lighting, such buttons are easy to notice, but in low light only memory or a spear method will save.  There is a backlight, vibration feedback too. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cce/1d7/5f5/cce1d75f5bec5bee534f09785a85a6ae.jpg"><br><br>  On the back are the camera's peephole, LED flash, speaker, and optional noise canceling microphone.  The surface of the cover is slightly rough and velvety.  The body is pleasant to the touch and almost does not get dirty fingerprints. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7c2/71e/c3c/7c271ec3c6bafcb99f094b655e63e806.jpg"><br><br>  Just below there is a modest company logo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/24f/e87/e61/24fe87e612f17680b43c9bdf0bd49fe8.jpg"><br><br>  External speaker at the bottom.  He is one and small.  The sound is loud and medium quality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bb8/391/881/bb8391881e0b886dea1d9f585cefe6ed.jpg"><br><br>  The upper end with a rough groove is occupied by a 3.5 mm headphone jack and a microUSB connector.  The smartphone supports work with Flash-drives via USB-interface (OTG). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7f4/5da/77e/7f45da77e761ddc6747e8e20794f97f3.jpg"><br><br>  On the right is a lock button on the background of glossy plastic.  To unlock, you do not need to shift the phone or drag it with your second hand - everything is clearly under your thumb. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4d0/7b1/518/4d07b1518eb4d220ede962e86ecbb0b4.jpg"><br><br>  If you look at the gadget in profile, you can see how its back case is gently bent.  Accordingly, the smartphone lies in the hand, like a glove and does not even think to slip.  At the bottom there is a recess for removing the back panel and the microphone hole. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/86e/d48/180/86ed481802a4824d0dea69e931c34ef4.jpg"><br><br>  It is worth noting the small thickness of the body and weight.  And oddly enough, but I still consider design one of the main advantages of the device: it has already become almost at the level of well-known manufacturers, and even surpasses them somewhere. <br><br><h2>  <font color="00a8ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">DISPLAY</font> </h2><br>  As befits the flagship, Iron Man is equipped with a high-quality display.  The device has received a 5-inch display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/698/60e/1d3/69860e1d3025d94d1f13f26bd43aa4cb.jpg"><br><br>  Since OGS technology is used here (‚Äúone glass solution‚Äù, the screen and glass are one), the picture quality becomes slightly better than without using OGS.  However, in real life, the only difference is that with OGS, the image is as close as possible to the screen surface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0c9/5b4/5b0/0c95b45b0c5768e66375787509d019d3.jpg"><br><br>  The color rendition is natural, the brightness is slightly above average (it is regulated in a small range either manually or automatically), the viewing angles are maximum. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/68b/6b7/732/68b6b7732bc4779d76d0c84761e63ded.jpg"><br><br>  The density is quite high - 441 PPI, at which to see the individual pixels is not so easy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/99c/449/e3a/99c449e3af5bf753b724084ec78b8c46.jpg"><br><br>  The sensor, of course, of the capacitive type, works out up to 5 simultaneous touches.  Sensitivity is good, no problems were noticed. <br><br><h2>  <font color="808080">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">DISASSEMBLY</font> </h2><br>  The lid is removed in the usual way, that is, using a special hook.  Removing it is not easy, but it lies tightly.  On its inner side there is an NFC antenna. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/59b/022/16c/59b02216cdb566877c0562b5fff1df5c.jpg"><br><br>  2300 mAh battery and weight 44g.  But it is possible to install a 2700 mAh battery (sold separately). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e3a/b7f/7a3/e3ab7f7a3ef1c1f24315cf691f32a605.jpg"><br><br>  Under the back cover we see: two SIM slots, a battery and a microSD slot <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/273/ea4/9f4/273ea49f421b44ec8bccee405c6a3ecb.jpg"><br><br>  Below is the speaker and you can see the warranty label on the screw.  But she certainly will not stop us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/56f/08c/51c/56f08c51c3b359c9682e5936aa3ac88c.jpg"><br><br>  To see the "insides of the patient," you need to unscrew the 12 screws.  Once unscrewed, you should click off the case with a plastic card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eb4/fdd/171/eb4fdd171b86766881a8c198db3a371d.jpg"><br><br>  Remove part of the body and gain access to the entrails. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/446/918/065/44691806558bc907b661d66a0f015ae1.jpg"><br><br>  Everything is quite simple here: slots for SIM-cards of Mini and Micro format, battery connector, MicroSD and rear camera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d09/b92/61d/d09b9261ddd69ff5a8447a082f749b67.jpg"><br><br>  Assembled smartphone quality.  No squeaks, no backlash. <br><br><h2>  <font color="ff0000">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">CAMERAS</font> </h2><br>  The description states that the ThL T100S is equipped with a 13 megapixel rear camera and a front one also with 13 megapixels.  The main camera is capable of taking pictures with a resolution of up to 4096x3072 pixels. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/637/b7e/382/637b7e382e0391769043f251165690ea.jpg"><br><br>  The autofocus system responds quickly to a change in the situation in the frame and allows you to shoot nearby objects.  The focus area can be specified manually. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/811/381/e61/811381e61ec94e11cfe42851aae2f2ec.jpg"><br><br>  HDR support allows you to take pictures with an extended light range. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5d9/251/c21/5d9251c21713c6a147be3361fda9fcaa.jpg"><br><br>  It is equipped with an LED flash, which copes well with its responsibilities in the evening, autofocus, has an aperture of f / 2.4, there is a face recognition function, as well as the ability to record video in FullHD format. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b83/c36/7a4/b83c367a425799fc09fc920f85a568e2.jpg"><br><br>  The front camera has similar characteristics, but as a rule it is used only for making video calls and communicating via Skype. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/65b/0cc/139/65b0cc139d9ba9a22777fd1a393d11b3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9db/c49/cef/9dbc49cef1e64f18d9eeeef6310e5767.jpg"><br><br>  The cameras are pretty good quality.  If you try and successfully pick up the angle and light, then it is quite possible to make a good shot. <br><br><h2>  <font color="00ffff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">SOFTWARE PLATFORM</font> </h2><br>  Smartphone ThL T100S running the operating system Android 4.2.2. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3f9/8cd/c0a/3f98cdc0aafd9591655c6a8d13c12750.png"><br><br>  The appearance of the system is almost unchanged.  Perhaps the only decoration is a translucent curtain of notifications and colored icons in the settings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/08d/80a/126/08d80a126b3232acd565e5ba01c6e7d4.png"><br><br>  A set of applications can be called standard, there are main Google services, including the Play Store and other standard Android stock applications (audio and video players, calculator, clock, etc.).  Of the extras added: a file manager, notes and a flashlight. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b4c/da4/b25/b4cda4b25ed2825664e1433d6911a256.png"><br><br>  One of the main features is the availability of an NFC module and firmware for working with it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/149/a8f/aae/149a8faae465eaeaded84503564bf61f.png"><br><br>  As you can see, the interface here is naked without a shell from the manufacturer.  Added some add-ons related to improving the sound (BesAudEnh) in the headphones and increasing the volume of the speakers (BesLoudness).  ClearMotion allows you to make the image on the TV more smooth and clear.  You can also calibrate the accelerometer and proximity sensor. <br><br><h2>  <font color="EA5F39">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">WIRELESS NETWORKS</font> </h2><br>  The smartphone supports dual SIM cards.  Interface and SIM-card settings are standard for MTK chipsets.  In the settings you can choose the main card for calls, SMS and mobile Internet.  Also the color of the honeycomb is adjusted there.  Formally, 3G supports two slots, but at the same time it can work only in one, the second one will always work in 2G only mode.  To change the 3G-card, you do not need to change its position with a 2G-card, just change the item in the settings of the mobile network. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/361/207/e55/361207e553c5e847547fd50f39d46cb2.png"><br><br>  In addition to voice communications, the ThL T100S received support for wireless technologies such as Wi-Fi b / g / n, Bluetooth 4.0 and GPS.  All communication technologies work well, at the level of analogs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4db/317/d59/4db317d5959c4f653fbd0db3157ec2f3.png"><br><br>  Unfortunately, there is no support for LTE, but not for long.  MediaTek has already introduced its first 64-bit processor with an integrated LTE module - a single-chip system MT6732.  Just when the coverage of 4G networks is already large enough, the processor will arrive in time. <br><br><h2>  <font color="9000ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">PRODUCTIVITY</font> </h2><br>  The MT6592 has a 4-core Mali-450MP4 video accelerator with a frequency of up to 700 MHz, which is about 2 times more powerful than the Mali-400MP2 installed in MT6582.  MT6592 is made in a modern 28nm process technology, integrated 8 core Cortex-A7 with a frequency of 1.7 GHz.  Second-level L2 cache is increased to 1Mb, LDDR2 533MHz / DDR3 666MHz and 13 megapixel cameras are supported.  Video recording can be made in 1080P 30fp formats, 1080P 30fps H.264 decoding, as well as in 2 new HEVC / H.265 and VP9 formats. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ff/c71/d5c/1ffc71d5cd87f163f90aba28d4d5eb44.png"><br><br>  2 GB of RAM and 32 GB internal (about 22 GB available to the user). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac4/3ab/f60/ac43abf60a4910d0b5f27a5f84f5770a.png"><br><br>  As a result, the device turned out really the most powerful among fellow Chinese and some smartphones from A-brands.  See for yourself by viewing the test results below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/627/b2b/ca8/627b2bca8f83e570e5d517d4283d15ba.png"><br><br>  On such hardware, the smartphone easily copes with high-quality 1080 / 50p video, including such popular formats as avi, mpeg and even mkv.  In addition, most modern 3D games can do it, for example: GTA: San Andreas, Dead Trigger 2, Colin McRae Rally, Deus Ex: The Fall and LEGO City My City. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/925/05a/87d/92505a87d4efbe61d2029a4008791282.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/373/034/a75/373034a75e4f111f82b1c744c9ded549.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5fc/b47/4eb/5fcb474eb9c682f7d520de87ff8f7d54.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/447/47a/be6/44747abe6cdb677e0b6b32d1da4b07f0.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dd1/861/593/dd18615932795d03c3f5cda1b077690e.png"><br><br>  In normal operation, the device is smart, the interface works smoothly without any hangs.  Also, there are no problems with work on the Internet, everything is fast and stable.  If you need a fairly high performance and an inexpensive price tag for it, then the MTK6582 platform and its capabilities will suit you completely. <br><br><h2>  <font color="1C1C1C">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">BATTERY, CHARGING, TIME OF WORK</font> </h2><br>  In the Antutu Batery test, the device scored 497 points.  In the video playback mode, the smartphone lasted almost 6 hours, and in the reading mode it was almost 10 hours. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ea/9c4/548/6ea9c454819dd4270b8eca2d47d60831.png"><br><br>  In fact, a full charge is enough for two full days, where calls, the Internet and music prevailed.  If you actively use games and videos, then count on one light day. <br><br><h2>  <font color="6BB501">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">CONCLUSION</font> </h2><br>  The Chinese smartphone market has really reached a new level of quality.  The design has already passed the stage of exact copying of successful third-party solutions and now the devices are being released, nothing like similar products.  Although in the field of innovation in design, the Chinese still do not have enough stars from the sky, preferring to look back at more eminent manufacturers, but who knows what will happen in a few years ... Many popular features are gradually being added (take, for example, the same NFC).  Yes, and design and development departments are in each factory, and their work is visible to the naked eye. <br><br><h2>  <font color="0c00ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  New eight-core processor <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Its unique design <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  High-quality assembly <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Safety glass Gorilla Glass 3 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Rich equipment <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Large memory and microSD slot <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Both cameras are 13 MP <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Low price <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f2/996/400/4f29964003baaf62d7bfefa7f2e32bf1.png" alt="image">  No support for LTE networks <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f2/996/400/4f29964003baaf62d7bfefa7f2e32bf1.png" alt="image">  Small battery capacity <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f2/996/400/4f29964003baaf62d7bfefa7f2e32bf1.png" alt="image">  Bad headset <br><br><h2>  <font color="E4F43B">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">PRICE AND PURCHASE</font> </h2><br>  The device can be purchased at the <a href="http://www.pandawill.com/thl-t100-iron-man-smartphone-mtk6592-octa-core-53-inch-fhd-screen-2gb-32gb-nfc-p83925.html">Pandawill</a> store. <br><br>  THL has released a ‚Äúgolden‚Äù version of the eight-core THL T100S smartphone.
