  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Multiplayer games stimulate cooperation between nations</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Virtual worlds are able to destroy the prejudices and xenophobia that exists in the real world.  Experts from the American <a href="http://www.uscpublicdiplomacy.org/">Center for Public Diplomacy at the University of Southern California</a> , who organized the original competition for developers of multiplayer games, are sure of this. <br><br>  Very many conflicts in our world arise because of the mutual dislike of each other by representatives of different nationalities.  For example, the conflict between Israel and Palestine has been stretching for several decades, and there is no end in sight.  American experts at the Center for Public Diplomacy believe that multiplayer online games (MMOG) can help solve this problem.  In the virtual world, Palestinians and Israelis have a chance to reach a new level of mutual understanding. <br><br>  The Palestinian-Israeli conflict is dedicated to one of the games submitted to the competition.  It is called <a href="http://www.etc.cmu.edu/projects/peacemaker/">‚ÄúPeacemaker‚Äù</a> (demo video in MPG format).  Here, players assume the role of leaders of both nations and are forced to face the usual problems of real life, such as the painstaking establishment of diplomatic relations, as well as military attacks, which are constantly <br>  make a rift in the negotiation process.

      Peacemaker is one of four games that reached the final of <a href="http://www.uscpublicdiplomacy.com/index.php/projects/mmog">the Public Diplomacy and Virtual Worlds</a> competition.  The final also included projects <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DJS2JT9IV3CM">Hydro Hyjinks</a> (problems of international water distribution), <a href="http://interactive.usc.edu/members/jmfernandez/2006/02/exchanging_cultures_ec_game.html">Exchanging Cultures</a> (a virtual market where people from different cultures can trade their artifacts), as well as the conceptual game <a href="http://www.globalkids.org/">Global Kids</a> for children. <br><br>  Interestingly, the competition itself, in fact, takes place in the virtual world.  The award ceremony (the top prize is $ 5000) is broadcast on a giant screen located in the amphitheater of a virtual island in the Second Life universe. <br><br>  The fact of holding such a competition suggests that politicians, sociologists, physicians, psychologists, and other specialists have become much more serious and positive about computer games.  A few years ago there was a very common view that computer games were rape and violence, which only corrupted adolescents.  Now comes the understanding that virtual worlds hide a huge potential in themselves.  It must be properly used. <br><br>  For example, take the same multiplayer online games that are currently experiencing a real boom, and the number of players is approaching 100 million.  Achieving success in such a game is impossible without cooperation with other players, without joining a clan, and without organizing at least temporary alliances and cooperation with other clans.  That is, the MMOG games really stimulate cooperation between large groups of players, <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/05/03/multiplayer_games_to.html">writes</a> Cory Doctorow on his blog, who, by the way, is on the jury of the competition. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4038/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4038/</a></p>
