  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Have an idea, is IKEA or how we solved the problem of furniture</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <a href="http://namvezet.ru/"><img src="http://i065.radikal.ru/1002/dc/f0f91ae82bcd.jpg" alt="namvezet"></a> <br>  One of my friends from Volgograd, having decided to set up his own business, got an office.  Repair done - need to put the furniture.  Here he writes to me: <br>  Listen, is there such office furniture in Moscow that was easy to deliver and was inexpensive for money? <br>  We did not think long, because IKEA is at hand.  We ourselves furnished her office and, in fact, told him about it. <br>  He is asking: <br>  <font color="#7F7F7F">-Ak IKEA in other cities carries?</font> <br>  Became interested.  No, only in Moscow and the nearest suburbs.  What to do? <br>  <font color="#7F7F7F">- Ok, I say, let's go like this: go to the IKEA website, choose the furniture, estimate how much it goes.</font>  <font color="#7F7F7F">If everything is ok, transfer money and I will buy everything for you and send it to the transport company.</font> <br>  So did.  I bought him a few tables and chairs, all sorts of small things.  The car transport company drove up to the store, it turned out compact and inexpensive. <br>  It seems done and forgotten.  A month later, he again wrote to me that they wanted to furnish the neighboring office and buy something for themselves at home.  We decided to repeat the scheme.  And then an idea came to my mind: since there is a need for such services, but there are no services, you have to offer them. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Made a site <a href="http://namvezet.ru/">namvezet.ru</a> . <br>  At first it was not very convenient - the client had to manually enter the articles and prices.  After receiving the order, we ourselves considered and called the cost of delivery to the client, but it took a lot of time.  In addition, the product was not always in stock, and we found out about it when the order was already issued.  It was necessary to recycle everything. <br>  We connected to the official IKEA website, from where information on dimensions and color is taken, as well as the availability of goods in stock.  Now all the client needs is to insert a link to the product in the form line on our website.  In addition, we talked with the transport company and agreed with their IT department about the possibility to build a calculator on our website to calculate the cost of delivery.  Everything is clear and simple.  The client sees that he orders and sees at what price the order will cost him, taking into account the cost of delivery. <br><br>  As it turned out, this is very much in demand outside of Moscow and the cities where IKEA is located.  People want to buy furniture, but they just do not have the opportunity to carry it themselves, or the time to go to the store. <br><br>  Now we carry furniture IKEA throughout Russia.  The new site has reduced the processing time of orders and freed from user errors. <br>  The majority of clients are various studios and organizations that buy furniture in offices. <br>  During the work 112 apartments were furnished, 85 offices and one restaurant) <br>  There are plans to start supplying IKEA furniture to the Far East, there are a lot of applications coming from there, but we still cannot technically send, according to calculations, in a month this direction will open to us.
