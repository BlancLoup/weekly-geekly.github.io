  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Car numbers and their applications</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Recently, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/vasyutka/" class="user_link">Vasyutka</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/vasyutka/" class="user_link">I</a> wrote a number of posts ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/221891/">1</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/222539/">2</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/223441/">3</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/recognitor/blog/225913/">4</a> ) about number recognition and about our view on the use of a recognition system.  After the publications there was a huge amount of interesting comments, letters and ideas.  The greatest number of thoughts and responses was, of course, in the style: ‚Äúmake an appeal to the traffic police‚Äù and ‚Äúscrew the sending of messages by numbers‚Äù.  But our main goal was not to create an application, but to create a recognition algorithm that anyone could use (although we will also develop the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dorg.opencv.samples.tutorial334565">application</a> slowly, leaving the source code <a href="https://github.com/ZlodeiBaal/Recognitor">open</a> ).  Therefore, many of the ideas we do not realize for a long time.  But this is no reason to be sad!  Services where all this already exists.  They are not very famous, but they are. <br><br><img width="500" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fcd/c40/5d1/fcdc405d12ea181becd676d9fd350f96.jpg"><br><br>  This post is about what projects of socialization and manifestations of active citizenship through the car number exist in Runet.  We studied these projects with surprise and curiosity when we were sent links or we ran across them.  I hope you enjoy it too, and maybe it will come in handy! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f9f/74a/3cc/f9f74a3cc3885345d18dea53acb62b48.png">

      <a href="http://autoimho.com/">Avtoimho</a> - Probably the most functional site on the declared possibilities in the open spaces of RuNet.  You can thank and scold the owner of the number, you can send a message to the traffic police.  Judging by what is written on the site, sending to the traffic police is not automated, you only need to use gosuslugi.ru, the site only helps to understand and shows the template.  Of the minuses - I would like to note the absence of an application, which, in my opinion, is necessary for such a project (the site itself is optimized for mobile phones, but in my opinion this is not enough).  There are about 6 thousand reviews. <br><br><img width="300" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/452/c5d/97a/452c5d97a17afbfb00b995160b481bf8.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="http://vk.com/spot_group">Spot</a> - Allows only one thing: send complaints to the traffic police on badly parked cars.  But it works and, according to comments on the Internet, periodically punishes.  The project exists only as an <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dorg.rocketscienceacademy.scout">application</a> to phones.  Your site is not, it is impossible to see the statistics by number.  But there is a good interface, detailed <a href="http://vk.com/doc-62354583_274632561%3Fdl%3Dc6a5b618c7ecb7da0b">instructions</a> on how to photograph violations.  After photographing, the message text and the car number are driven in.  The operator on the site checks the application and sends it to the traffic police.  The main disadvantage, it seems to me, is the absence of any socialization around the project, the rest is done abruptly. <br><br>  The VKontakte group contains 500 people, the application itself is installed in 10,000-50000 people.  According to the information in the official community, the program allows you to enter the following violations: <br><br>  1. Parking second row <br>  2. Parking on the ground for people with disabilities <br>  3. Parking on the sidewalk <br>  4. Parking under the sign "Stop prohibited" <br>  5. Parking at a pedestrian crossing <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d95/bb4/e77/d95bb4e77b3b3f515b0cc96f7efc3a08.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://nomer.auto.ru/">nomer.auto.ru</a> - a well-known site-bulletin board tries to gather people around itself, where users would share events, marking them with geotags and car numbers in them participating.  You can thank and curse the numbers.  There is no opportunity to send numbers to the traffic police, there is no separate application.  The number of users of the service is difficult to estimate, but, apparently, there are no more than ten or two thousand messages in the database, of which far from all are attached to numbers.  There is a feeling that the development of the service is not a priority for the administration.  It is curious what will happen to him after the purchase by <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/yandex/blog/226381/">Yandex</a> . <br><br><img width="300" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f55/c68/1ed/f55c681ed13b4db8729fc400b0dca369.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://specials.the-village.ru/pages/specials/parking">The Village</a> is an application created by PR magazine <a href="http://specials.the-village.ru/pages/specials/parking">for The Village</a> .  It was maintained, apparently for 1-2 months, until they won a prize.  In fact, it is partially a prototype of the Spot application.  Sending to the traffic police is not provided, automatic recognition, too (maybe once it was, but now just does not work).  Currently a dead project. <br>  When the project was alive, it focused on the social component and the attempt to create a shameful board for violators: <br>  " <i>We decided to show the worst examples of parking throughout the city. We made an application that allows citizens to collect and distribute information about cases of incorrect parking.</i> " <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8d3/f79/f46/8d3f79f46992e9786fdbf11ba292225f.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://yazapomnil.ru/">YaZapomnil</a> - Very strange <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.yazapomnil.app">application</a> .  It offers to photograph the number, then automatically recognize it.  And then ... It offers the user a mnemonic rhyme so that he can memorize the number.  Apparently no database with comments, sent to the traffic police, etc.  not provided.  But you can remember the poem ... <br><br><img width="300" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/869/10f/f7a/86910ff7a20288cace6b778d2d3a1a31.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://racebook.su/">RaceBook</a> - send a message to a scored car number.  You can send angry, you can be friendly.  Very small database of messages.  The project has just begun to develop. <br><br><img width="300" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aca/833/180/aca833180d90a9668bae94905ed27429.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://autocarma.org/">AutoCarma</a> - a little out of the test.  Application for Ukrainian numbers.  Judging by the site somewhere around 5000 reviews.  But there is its application on the phone, albeit without recognition.  Sending to the traffic police (traffic police, DAI,?) Is not provided. <br><br><img width="300" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bf8/959/247/bf8959247d7698fcecff6e82a99c2c14.gif"><br><br>  <a href="http://avto-nomer.ru/">avto-nomer</a> A bit mysterious project out of competition.  Just allows you to send photos of car numbers, without comments on them.  A community of people that likes to shoot numbers.  But the base is stunning size. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eb9/fc1/abc/eb9fc1abc2059cf91e46afb767beb360.jpg"><br>  <a href="http://yeehay.ru/">Yeehay!</a>  - Linked to the map and the navigator system that allows you to leave comments on the map on the current traffic situation + send a message to the car number.  There is no number recognition, it is impossible to send messages to the traffic police.  First of all it is oriented precisely to entertain the driver in a traffic jam.  The installation of the application on the Google 1000-5000, there is an application under the iphone. <br><br><img width="300" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ea/8e5/da7/2ea8e5da7f8f0664aa03204060745812.jpg"><br>  <a href="http://numplates.ru/">Nomera</a> is another social network where you can write messages by numbers.  It turns out that they even have a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mrt/">blog</a> on Habr√©, but no publications.  The main site is a strange feeling.  Design from the early 2000s.  By clicking "Download the application in Google Play" offers .apk-shku download.  There is an <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/nomera/id583704287%3Fmt%3D8">application</a> for iOS.  VKontakte <a href="http://vk.com/numbers_app">group</a> has 5000 subscribers.  Not quite clear where: a search in Yandyx gives a maximum of 2 pages of results.  The site is running on-line tape of current incoming comments (~ 10 per minute), which seems to me much more than the carrying value of such a project.  Feels like his trying with might and main to unwind and create the appearance of life. <br><br>  Of course, all these sites are quite small.  And any social system of such a plan will begin to benefit only when there are many active users around it.  If large projects such as angrycitizen.ru, gorod.mos.ru, Navalny with their RosPilami and RosZhKH engaged in numbers, then perhaps in a couple of years, people would start to behave decently on the roads.  In the meantime ... I would like to wish good luck to all the enthusiasts listed in the article.  There are not so many of them, but they are trying to do something. <br><br>  PS If we have forgotten something / have not found - write, add to the article. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/223711/">https://habr.com/ru/post/223711/</a></p>
