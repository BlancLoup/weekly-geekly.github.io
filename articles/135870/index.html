    <a name="habracut"></a>  I am a third year student at one of the best universities in the country.  I am engaged in physics and computer science.  I regularly write not the most complex sites, in order to improve themselves.  For about three years, I regularly read Habrahabr. <br><br>  I think that the article mentioned above did not inspire me to act alone.  Yes, there is a volume and objectively described the problems of education in the IT-sphere.  But there are almost no advantages of university education. <br><br>  There is a good physical base in my university, which simply cannot be approached without special programming skills.  Having studied the basics of LabVIEW and the primitive Turbo pascal, we can begin to work in laboratories.  Of course, the first courses were primitive work, which did not need special skills.  Teachers at the age similar to those described in the last article, who said that ‚Äúthe future is behind console applications‚Äù claimed that behind Pascal lies the whole basis of research in physics (meant: data collection and processing). This method is long and dreary.  It‚Äôs much easier in LabVIEW to simply assemble a dashboard for yourself, set the values ‚Äã‚Äãfor the instruments and write a measurement algorithm in any pleasant programming language to the laboratory technician. <br>  That is, if quite briefly.  If you wish, I will write in more detail about all the processes related to programming in physics, I am waiting for the wishes in the comments. <br><br>  But that's not the point. <br>  Naturally, a large number of high-quality equipment, the cost of which often reaches several million dollars, cannot appear just like that.  And here lies the whole importance of students in universities. <br>  The principle is simple: the student is taught until a certain moment, and then he manifests himself on the basis of the university.  If necessary, he can always get advice and assistance from his and, by the way, not only his own manager. <br>  The development of students interested in serious companies, which then make large orders. <br>  Funds from orders are made to the fund of the department, plus encouraging students for work.  Promotion is solid. <br><br>  Certainly it will be interesting what were the examples of development: additives in motor oils, which almost reduce all friction in the engine;  surface treatment;  alternative light sources;  etc. <br><br>  Throughout this base, the student is improved in the skills of physics, programming and, after completing the writing of the diploma, goes out with highly qualified personnel in several environments at once. <br><br>  I hope with such a brief description, I explained that not all of our universities are so weak in education and fit the description of the previous article. <br>  Of course, self-education has a big role in human development, but the scientific base is also important. <br><br>  Yes, and the study, as many say "to anyone unnecessary" sciences, which are loaded at the university, will no longer be superfluous, if only for self-development, now and solving crossword puzzles in times of happy old age. <br><br>  In order to somehow visualize all of the above, he led the picture, it shows a JEM-2100F translucent electron microscope, to which only specks of dust can be let in without special skills in physics and programming. <br><br>  Do not sleep in lectures, and many at work, friends!  I wish you all success in all your endeavors. <br><br>  I look forward to criticism and suggestions in the comments. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/135870/">https://habr.com/ru/post/135870/</a></p>
