About how it was, what problems and solutions met and so on - I ask under the cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, first of all, after registration, they gave me a large paper bag with a very cool item ‚Äî <b>Yandex Yandex</b> (which isn't even <a href="http://collection.yandex.ru/">here</a> ) and other Yandex merch. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">full list</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  ice floe; </li><li>  paper bag; </li><li>  paper wallet; </li><li>  notebook; </li><li>  paper pen with blue ink; </li><li>  paper rubbing for glass iphone. </li></ul><br></div></div><br>  We were held to the big hall, which for these two days became a habitat for more than 20 teams with cool ideas and given freedom.

      I want to note that the only rule was to somehow use the Yandex.Money API (even for the donate button).  Since it allowed to do any projects, without a framework for the language, theme and implementation, that is, if only there was an API - this is very cool! <br><br>  It was very easy to find the team and to ‚Äústake out‚Äù the idea in advance - I went on stage and said what you want and what is missing (designer, ideas, etc) - so quickly people found what they needed and connections with interesting people were born!  Many came with their teams with ready-made ideas and very soon began to work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/56c/9a9/788/56c9a9788e9540c5bd62d4e477437131.jpg"><br>  <i>The view from the smoking room is a place where ideas flowed in and a marker board helped - a kind of negotiation for us and a meeting place with interesting people.</i> <br><br>  The organizers did everything simply and conveniently - billiards, a tour of the office, fresh coffee and a working atmosphere with fast wifi, lots of places and cool local guys.  So flew hour after hour, after the start of the timer, and until we had the main and only problem - Yandex.Money API, which the night before the event was updated for php (on which we wrote back-end) and it was slightly raw.  At the first tests, money began to be withdrawn from us, although the test flags stood as true, our ‚Äúpackages‚Äù were low 0.02 $, but the commission was 1/2 of our amount and so we lost money.  The guy who released the library at night could not find an answer to our question, and attempts to learn from others did not work, as a result we spat and threw at the expense of those same 10 rubles, which were spent during the whole event for testing, but we are not very upset by this loss! <br><br>  Hours, minutes went by, projects were written, the final approached, everything was almost ready for all the teams and people prepared presentations and speeches, X hour was nearing.  We had no presentation, no speech, no way to explain the idea;  as the smoking room contributed not only to the ideas, we met with a local copywriter employee and she helped to formalize our ideas and help morally, because it was necessary to keep within 180 seconds.  The jury was competent and knew what they were asking, always getting into the most subtle places of the projects and gave useful advice / leading questions on how to move forward and develop, dealt with cases and showed genuine interest in every job. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e75/827/a17/e75827a17f8134559d8cfa0ef834e230.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>The decision is made and everyone is waiting for the results.</i> <br><br>  As a result of the hakaton, the number of seats was expanded and a nomination was added, so the prizes found their owners and everyone slowly dispersed. <br>  It was one of the most productive 28 hours, the smallest dream - 37 minutes and wonderful people for two days.  Thank! <br><br>  Ps I wrote after the hackathon, when I woke up and, remembering step by step, could have missed or omitted something - write in the comments, who was, I will gladly add. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> <br>  I will expand the topic with a description of our project, which we did and tell you about the projects of the winners, or even yesterday I posted a raw text, which I myself am not happy about, and I will also tell you what a hackathon is. <br><br>  Since it was allowed to use all that is possible, and the API was on a large set of popular programming languages, we decided to write a small service with PHP / MySQL under the hood, and for the client we took jQuery + BigVideo.js <br><br>  We decided not to choose a new <s>donation</s> donation theme (suitable for the hackathon theme), but not just as a sequence: enter the purse number, choose the amount and click ‚Äúdonate‚Äù, we thought why people in the subway, on the streets, etc collect money for global problems: diseases, protection of chinchillas, combating environmental disasters, and, for example, you just can not collect a hundred or two to sit with friends in a bar.  Resolved ‚Äì done.  It was thought that after a simple registration on the site you entered the wallet number and the amount of the goal (not exceeding 3K rubles) and started to wait.  Other people who were (not) registered could make a voluntary donation, but the target wallet was chosen randomly from the participants of the action, which allowed them to ‚Äúfill in‚Äù the participants' goals, and if the amount covered the target and the rest remained, it was evenly distributed between neighboring participants numbers. <br><br>  Why did people have to go there and give money to unknown people for unknown purposes?  Explanation can be called something in the likeness of the law of karma, because there are such moments when suddenly a lot of money comes in, and in accordance with this law, they also have to quickly leave, and there is a place where you can make someone nice.  And besides, if you participate in this, you will not be bypassed either - everything is interconnected! <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">This was our project (main page)</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6cf/0c5/7e0/6cf0c57e07ac4ee9a91c2fca523f5cd8.png"><br></div></div><br><br>  Winners and winners: <br>  The number of nominations was 3: <br><ul><li>  The best project (main prize) </li><li>  Best Mobile App </li><li>  Best Innovative Product </li></ul><br>  The following ideas won: <br>  The main prize is a modget site for creating a product widget and selling it from any site. <br>  The best mobile app is happy phone (iOS) and a cool alarm clock (I don‚Äôt remember the name), who shot money if you didn‚Äôt get up on time from bed <br>  The best innovative product is the iOS application for paying for goods when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBeacon">iBeacon</a> is nearby. <br><br>  And the 4th nomination added at the very end went to an interesting Android application that allowed you to pay with QR codes! <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">What is a hackathon</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Hackathon (from hackathon, from hack (see hacker) and marathon - marathon) is an event during which specialists from different areas of software development (programmers, designers, managers) work together to solve a problem.  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">Wiki</a> </div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/240247/">https://habr.com/ru/post/240247/</a></p>
