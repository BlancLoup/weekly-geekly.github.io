We warn you right away - this is not the whole program, there will be much more interesting events and speeches. </blockquote><br><h2>  Expert reports and master classes </h2><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">View a detailed map of the main hall</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1d3/f2a/68a/1d3f2a68a90d4516b7709db896122181.jpg"><br></div></div><br>  The conference will host several interesting demonstrations and workshops, there will be classic reports from practitioners who are ready to share their experiences. <br><br><blockquote>  For those who for some reason cannot be in the Telegraph, online broadcasts will be conducted. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dgj-s3Lnodtw">From the main hall</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DzkFUWevsaJo">From the IT room</a> <br><br>  <i><b>Do not forget to press the "Remind" button on the channel!</b></i> <br><br>  Participation in the event is free, admission is pre-registration <a href="https://ufs-programm.timepad.ru/event/490838/">on the site</a> . <br><br> <a href="https://ufs-programm.timepad.ru/event/490838/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/50d/1c9/f1f/50d1c9f1f24d42bb964923c5bd70b6a6.png"></a> <br></blockquote><br>  <b>‚Üí UX-giveaway - Ilya Shakirov, SberTech</b> <br><br>  Ilya will talk about the rules of the game, which sometimes change the whole game.  To play well "giveaway", you need to play chess well.  To make a bad interface, you do not need special knowledge.  But in order to collect the worst interface - you have to try.  Consider several long-known patterns and compete - who can make the simplest things as complex as possible, inconvenient and difficult to understand. <br><br>  <b>‚Üí Rapid prototyping at React - Nikolay Nadorichev, SberTech</b> <br><br>  Nikolay, the leader of the front-end development of the EFS Sberbank Program, will tell you how to create an application using React technology in just one evening.  Nikolay participates in conferences and meetings on the topic, and also writes a topic in the blog of the program on Habr√©.  It will not be just a report, but a prototype prototype class at React. <br><br>  To get to the master class of rapid prototyping at React is simple: it is free, just register with the form <a href="https://ufs-programm.timepad.ru/event/490838/">https://ufs-programm.timepad.ru/event/490838/</a> <br>  An online broadcast will be organized for regional participants. <br><br>  <b>‚Üí Products that are not yet available - master class, Irina Zhigalova, Sberbank, and Alexey Borodkin, Notamedia</b> <br><br>  What unites the flying DeLorian car, the hoverboard and the self-knitted sneakers from the second part of the film ‚ÄúBack to the Future‚Äù? <br>  Look at these products carefully.  On the one hand, they have a familiar, recognizable base - this is a real-life car, a familiar skateboard, and the most common sneakers.  On the other hand, each of these products contains an assumption (one or more), which makes them more convenient, expands the scope of their application and allows you to go beyond the usual.  So ordinary products are transformed into products of the future, in which you want to believe and whose appearance you want to wait. <br><br>  Participants will practice creating concepts of useful products that are impossible in our life now, but may appear in the future.  We will show that anyone can create such products.  The master class will help develop the skill of finding solutions outside the usual framework and limitations - a useful skill for any specialist who creates something new. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">View a detailed map of creative technologies.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c1e/7dc/a0b/c1e7dca0bcad43b39e28c8043122d29e.jpg"><br></div></div><br>  <b>‚Üí Deep Learning.</b>  <b>Demonstration - Dmitry Korobchenko, Deep Learning R &amp; D engineer at NVIDIA</b> <br><br>  At the conference, Dmitry will tell you how neural networks work and learn, will demonstrate their creation on the example of one of the tasks in the field of computer vision. <br><br>  Dmitry was a software engineer at IBM, then worked for Samsung for about 5 years, where he was involved in research tasks related to machine learning, computer vision and signal processing.

For one task.  Lyubov will share the unique experience of organizing Agile ceremonies and will tell how she and the team of the ESF program manage to carry out PI Planning for 500 participants.  She will analyze what has already happened and will reveal the secret that I would like it to turn out better or earlier. <br><br>  In the Sberbank's Unified Frontal Program, Lyubov has been creating a system that supports product owners and project managers from the moment the idea was conceived until the project was approved and resources were allocated for its implementation.  Love is involved in the planning of projects and provides simultaneous synchronization of the work of more than 50 projects. <br><br>  <b>‚Üí We exceed the speed limits with Angular 4 IPONWEB - Alexey Okhrimenko, Senior JavaScript Developer at IPONWEB, the author of the design pattern MALEVICH and the PEG parser SimplePEG</b> <br><br>  Alexey will talk about exceeding the speed limits with Angular 4.

With the development of projects and the scale of development, it became obvious that in order to structure the work of teams with thousands of lines of code and hundreds of modules, a different approach to development and testing is needed. <br><br>  Therefore, forming the conference program, it was impossible to ignore the progressive topic of the DevOps development methodology (Development-Operations).  We invite all those who are not indifferent and are interested in talking about a morning cup of coffee in a pleasant company of the leaders of the DevOps direction of the ESF program. <br><br>  On the discussion agenda: <br><br><ul><li>  containerization or virtuals when building Pipeline; <br></li><li>  approach to end-to-end industrial management: who should be responsible? <br></li><li>  classic configuration management systems vs DevOps. <br></li></ul><br>  <b>‚Üí Agile Retrospective - Zhanna Dichenko and Maxim Katkov will hold, Sberbank</b> <br><br>  In the game format under the guidance of certified business coaches Zhanna Dichenko and Maxim Katkov, participants will be able to see and feel how some Agile principles work.  In the course of the assignment, it will be possible to compare the impact on the outcome of different communication options, find out why transparency and interaction with the customer are needed throughout the project. <br><br>  Retrospective is a ceremony that answers the burning question: ‚ÄúHow do you turn a good team into a great one?‚Äù Retrospective allows the team to inspect their own work and increase the efficiency of processes by creating improvement plans for the next iteration.  During the master class, the presenters will immerse the participants in one of the fundamental Scrum ceremonies, consider the algorithms for conducting a retrospective.  Participants will be able to ask questions and hear examples from actual practice: how, using a retrospective, the teams increase their efficiency, and what its wrong conduct leads to. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">View a detailed master class map</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/060/f87/e41/060f87e41096420db74386fb3447fe91.jpg"><br></div></div><br>  ‚Üí In May, the EFS Program held an open master class on design thinking with the wonderful Dmitry Makeev at Moscow State University.
