I really liked this article and I decided to translate it, at the same time and read it better. <br>  All that is stated here - only assumptions and theories, it is quite possible that all or some of the events will be different.  The entire post is presented in the form of a time-tape from 10,000 to <sup>10,100</sup> years, and contains many interesting pictures and links to the wiki, reading a lot and interesting. <br><br><hr><br><h4>  10,000 - 15,000 N.E. </h4><br><h3>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F">Hypernova</a> of the star system <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0_%25D0%259A%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F">This</a> <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F">Carinae</a> begins to affect our region of the Galaxy </h3><br>  This Kiel is one of the largest and most unstable stars in our galaxy.  Its temperature is so high that its gravity is not able to keep the gas flowing from its surface along the formed upstream from it.

This fluctuation continues with periodic flashing and fading, and will continue until the inevitable happens.  Unable to cope with its own mass and density, it <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BF%25D1%2581_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B4%25D1%258B">collapses</a> and then turns into one of the deadliest forces known in nature - into the hypernovae. <br>  For a while, this colossal explosion illuminates the entire galaxy.  It will be bright enough to notice from Earth during the daytime, while at night it is comparable to the full moon. <br>  But much more harm will bring killer streams of gamma radiation emitted by a dying star.  They will be thrown out at such high energies that even systems in thousands of light years from Eta Carinae will be affected.  As a result, on numerous planets in our region of the Galaxy there will be an extinction of living organisms at this time. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/05f/ce9/687/05fce968722a56370749a07ef46b5804.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  22,000 N.E. </h4><br><h3>  The place of the Chernobyl disaster becomes completely safe. </h3><br>  The Chernobyl explosion, which occurred in 1986, was the worst nuclear accident in history, infecting tens of thousands of square kilometers of land.  The radiation at the center of this incident has now reached an insignificant level at which a person can live safely. <br>  In any case, the old buildings on the site is long gone, and, in fact, the Earth is already completely unrecognizable. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/357/900/c17/357900c17e17919840c1bb3c6ae30ad5.jpg">

Having passed through many millennia, the first wave of subluminal ships finally reached its environs. <br>  There are no people on board, they are fully computerized and autonomous.  Trillions, they are self-replicating using stellar and planetary material in their path.  The systems on ships that appeared during this voyage evolved and evolved thanks to artificial intelligence.  This is almost the same as the awakening of the galaxy itself and its acquisition of self-awareness. <br>  There is no competition for owning the core of the galaxy.  Wars, greed, and archaic concepts of nations and nationalities have long since disappeared, leaving only intellectual creations united by one common goal. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/405/f0b/5cb/405f0b5cbfd3f8526626e89b4340f71c.jpg"><br>  In addition to the black hole, there are dense clusters of ancient, metal-rich stars, separated by just a few light weeks or even days.  They can provide innumerable reserves of resources for fleets arriving. <br>  Gamma radiation is so high in this place that almost no biological creature is able to survive here, except for the strongest bacteria of extremophiles.  If an observer could stand on a planet close to the galactic nucleus, the sky above him would look like a blinding screen of light and color. <br>  Reaching the center of the galaxy, now all the forces will be directed to research its far side and the secrets that lie there.

In 35000 AD  she is closer to us than Proxima Centauri.

They were encoded into a glass, radiation-resistant DVD, along with instructions on how to assemble a DVD reader.  A sample of human blood, earth, air and sea water was also placed on board. <br>  The capsule itself is a hollow sphere, 80cm in diameter.  A map of the Earth is engraved on the sphere, and the sphere itself is wrapped in a layer of aluminum, a thermal layer and several layers of titanium, separated by a vacuum.  The sphere is resistant to cosmic radiation, atmospheric resistance (at the entrance) and the effects of space debris. <br>  Placed into an orbit 1800km above the Earth, the satellite slowly approached it a few tens of meters each year.  When he finally enters the atmosphere, his thermal layer will begin to emit a bright, artificial glow that signals his return. <br><br><h4>  100,000 N.E. </h4><br><h3>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582">The red hypergiant</a> <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/VY_%25D0%2591%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2588%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE_%25D0%259F%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0">VY of the Big Dog</a> exploded, leaving one of the largest <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2585%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F">supernovae</a> that the Galaxy has ever seen. </h3><br>  VY Big Dog, about 1800-2100 times larger than our Sun, is the largest star in the Milky Way known to us, as well as the brightest.
