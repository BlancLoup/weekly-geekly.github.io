Just for yourself (not quite so simple, but about motivation a little further).  Receiving such a ‚Äúpaper‚Äù has become a new quest for me and I will talk about how to go through it, having simultaneously passed all turnouts and passwords in Kiev.  Of course, not counting a specific certification authority, everything said is also relevant for non-Kiev residents. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Jedi Long Road</b> <br><br>  At the initial stage, you need to go through the certification path Java Programmer SE and from a certain point you can already choose a specialization.  At the moment, in order to reach the possibility of choice, you must pass two exams: Java Programmer I and Java Programmer II <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/523/dce/c07/523dcec07e0248bc6d446512b00f53a3.png"><br>  After that, you can already choose the direction of specialization.

After choosing one or more exams, depending on the chosen path.  I am very impressed with HER, so I went there and outlined my course =) <br>  Areas of specialization: <br><blockquote>  <a href="https://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/ou_product_category.getPage%3Fp_cat_id%3D267"><b>Java SE</b></a> <br>  The Java Platform Standard Edition (Java SE) offers today's application require.

From myself I want to say that I was preparing a slightly different scenario.  I read the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/extra/certification/javase-7-programmer1.html">official tutorial training on the "Orthodox" site</a> .  The material is set out available, simple and important for the topics from the exam, which is very important. <br><br>  After the tutorial is passed, re-read and it seems that everything is mastered with a bang, we proceed to the practical part of the preparation - questions.  I used the questions taken from here: <a href="http://www.examcollection.com/1Z0-803.html">http://www.examcollection.com/1Z0-803.html</a> .  The questions themselves are distributed in the vce format and are absolutely free, but you can only open them with a paid program, which I purchased for iOS.  The advantages of this program are that it is practically under all popular, both mobile and desktop platforms, so you can safely study the issues of home or sitting at home on a PC. <br><br>  Now for the quality of the questions themselves.  You should not look at the answers in these files.  They are wrong in many places.  The best in quality of answers is worth noting in files with 66 questions, but they are not as complete in terms of the questions as the file with questions.  But the one where 122 questions can not be downloaded at all, it‚Äôs not clear there =) In other words, I repeat - these questionnaires are not for learning the answers, but for looking at what the questions will be! <br><br>  Looking ahead, I want to say that somewhere around 30-50% of the questions on the exam were the same as in this questionnaire, while the others were different, but the complexity was exactly the same and on the same topics!  If someone has already looked into these questions, then thinking will agree that for an experienced programmer, they IN GENERAL will not be difficult. <br><br>  The official textbook and questionnaire, IMHO, is great enough for comprehensive preparation for certification.  Since I was a former C ++ nickname and moved to a relatively new language relatively recently, in the process of preparation, even for this entire level exam, I learned something interesting and new. <br><br>  <b>Choosing a certification authority</b> <br><br>  Prepared and decided to take.  It is necessary to go through a simple procedure.  Register on the <a href="http://vue.com/">VUE</a> website.  ‚ÄúWhat kind of VUE, but I‚Äôll pass the Oracle certificate?‚Äù Many might think.  Calm  Oracle itself develops certification, but trusts its implementation to a certified center.  He, in turn, has an agreement with the centers on the ground.  When registering on their website ( <a href="http://vue.com/">http://vue.com/</a> ) you need to choose the scope of certification.  Further, it is enough to choose a certification center, choose a convenient time, write down their address and appear at the appointed time. <br><br>  Payment for the exam passes by bank transfer (ie. Card).  Cost - 150 USD <br><br>  There are about five centers in Kiev.  After a certain search, I stopped at <a href="http://www.flane.com.ua/">http://www.flane.com.ua/</a> .  And did not regret.  Their office provided the greatest possible advice on the process of passing.  Geographically, they are located on Pozniaky (5 minutes from the metro). <br><br>  <b>Certification</b> <br><br>  Appears for certification is necessary for 15-20 minutes before the specified time.  So that you do not have a chance to write off, all personal belongings are locked in the closet, the key of which is given to you personally.  At the exam you are given the correct leaflet and the correct pen.  Before the very beginning of the exam you are photographed and take a copy of your signature. <br><br>  <u>Important:</u> you need to have two documents with you with your last name and first name.  On one of the documents they must be written in Latin (these data will be indicated in your certificate).  I used my foreign passport and Ukrainian passport. <br><br>  The exam gives 90 questions and two and a half hours of time.  Plus, after the exam, two questions about the quality of the exam and its usefulness.  All questions in style: choose option two or three.  Those.  Always know the number of correct answers.  2 and a half hours is more than enough for delivery.  I managed one and a half (and this is in view of the fact that I revised my answers). <br><br>  In the process of passing the tests, you can mark questions and return to them later.  This is very useful and gives you the opportunity at the beginning to answer all that you know, and then everything that you doubt.  The test result is reported immediately and a printout is made. <br><br>  <b>Buns</b> <br><br>  It is a little about banal and material buns which you receive after examination.  And so, on the official website it is clearly indicated what will be sent to you after a successful delivery: <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Oracle Program Certification Levels</b> <br></td><td>  <b>Associate</b> <br><br></td><td>  <b>Professional</b> <br><br></td><td>  <b>Master</b> <br><br></td><td>  <b>Expert</b> <br><br></td><td>  <b>Specialist</b> <br><br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Program Benefits</b> <br></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  Personalized Certification Certificate </td><td><br>  ‚àö <br><br></td><td><br>  ‚àö <br><br></td><td><br>  ‚àö <br><br></td><td><br>  ‚àö <br><br></td><td><br>  ‚àö <br><br></td></tr><tr><td>  Personalized ID Card <br></td><td></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  Ocm apparel <br></td><td></td><td></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  Secure Access to downloadable Certification Logos <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Secure Access to CertView Certification Portal <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Access Certification 3rd Party Verification Tool <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Special events and hospitality at OOW <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br><br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td></tr><tr><td>  eCertificate on request <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Professional Benefits</b> <br></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  Industry credibility <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Higher average salary compared with non certified colleagues <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Preferred access to cloud based employment <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Fulfill Oracle Partner Network Company Membership level requirements <br></td><td></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  In other words, upon delivery of 1Z0-803, you become Assosiate, and for this a plastic certificate is required.  At the next stage, even send a certificate!  Well, is not it a reason =)? <br><br>  To get the same card, you need to perform several manipulations that are written on a piece of paper with the test result, after which the result will appear not only on the vue website, but also on the Oracle website, and from that moment they will deliver it to you within 4-6 weeks. <br><br>  <b>Motivation (well, or conclusions about the usefulness of this adventure)</b> <br><br>  Much has been said about this.  But I still add my couple of kopecks.  Initial certificates are not often needed, but can play a crucial role!  I have been in the shoes of a man who takes on a robot of people.  And by itself, if several candidates are about the same and go to the initial positions, then the person with the certificate is much more preferable and we will choose it.  And if you think that you are the only one so unique, well, then you only need the initial certificate in order to go further because such is the requirements of Oracle. <br><br>  As for higher certificates, then everything is more interesting.  In the CIS, for example, not many have the highest level of business architect.  This does not mean that very few people with such knowledge, just many of those who possess them are not interested in certification.  However, on the other hand, if you are at the initial stage, then you will have to prove that you deserve the title of architect for a long time, and such a system of attestation of a specialist allows you to at least formally receive confirmation that you are already at this level, which can later become decisive. <br><br>  In short, this piece of paper will bring exactly as much benefit as you can squeeze out of it (and therefore may not bring it at all).  Moreover, I also have this study motivator, since having paid for the exam in advance, whether you want to or not, you will learn =) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/157165/">https://habr.com/ru/post/157165/</a></p>
