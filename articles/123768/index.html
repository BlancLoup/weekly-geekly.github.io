      I will not give you an unequivocal answer, but I will be able to give information for reflection to all parents.  Who cares, welcome under the cat <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So thinking.  There are several forms of thinking (3-4 in different approaches).  They develop in a certain sequence.  The first subject-effective thinking.  It is associated with direct activities.  Those.  in order to perform some kind of mental operation on an object, you must have it in your hands.  The second, visual-shaped.  To perform a mental operation, it is necessary to see the object and perceive it (that is, to form its image).  This type of thinking is dominant in children of preschool and primary school levels [Maklakov AG].  Third, verbal logic.  At this stage, the child is already able to think using words as symbolic reflections of objects.  In this case, the object may not be in sight.  And the last, abstract logical.  This thinking is through even higher levels of generalization. <br><br>  Now back to the question.  ‚ÄúWhat is worse for the child‚Äôs mind at the age of five? Three-dimensional shooters or a Linux console.‚Äù <br>  First, the pros.  What give three-dimensional shooters.  Here I will mainly be based on someone's real research [ <a href="http://www.rochester.edu/news/show.php%3Fid%3D3342">1</a> , <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v423/n6939/full/nature01647.html">2</a> , <a href="http://cyberpsy.ru/2011/01/igrat-%25E2%2580%2593-polezno-strelyaem-i-razvivae/">3</a> , <a href="http://cyberpsy.ru/2010/12/dzhejn-makgonigal-gejmery-mogut-sdela/">4</a> (do not be alarmed to see these studies, there are others who are more wary of games)].  If we temporarily put aside the ethical moments and the history of the formation of aggressiveness, then we get the development of reaction speed, the ability to interact in a team, the development (!) Of visual-figurative thinking (storylines), abstract logical (construction in the head of the maze), a little verbal logical and specific (in view of IT mediation) subject-effective, etc. <br>  What can give the console?  This is certainly a very strong development of verbal-logical (actually procedural functional programming) and abstract-logical thinking (depending on the complexity of the structures with which it operates). <br>  It would seem that the console can give less profit, but due to the fact that they are not smeared, the results can be much higher.  Those.  a person who works in the console can operate in the head with incredible data (still, save the file system, the list of commands, the structure of applications), but it can be more difficult for him to become a real architect. <br><br>  !!!  Important.  In addition to the console and 3D toys, there are specific games designed for children of a certain age.  But here I can tell you nothing (who, what, how much). <br><br>  Cons common: the time of the child, live communication, eyes and back. <br><br>  Hazards for toys.  Toys are somehow formed world (for adults igrah - adult world), which carries a ready-made set of actions and relationships.  The child through the game passes socialization.  Good or bad, depends mainly on game developers.  In fact, behavior strategies are borrowed for children of this age.  There is even such a term, ‚Äúvicarious teaching‚Äù is called.  What is it every parent should know.  Children, just at this age already slowly begin to differentiate reality and fiction (younger children perceive fairy tales as real life). <br><br>  For consoles, cons do not even come to my head right away, except maybe a perverted hatred of gui :) but seriously, communication problems may arise.  But this again forks on the water.  I have no data. <br><br>  And one more important thing.  Mandatory program for children in my opinion.  Computers are nice, but the child should dominate the experience of communicating with real objects (and subjects) of the world. <br>  You can read at least a thousand times in Wikipedia what is <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2587%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B0_%2528%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%2529">mustard</a> , but if you have never tried it, you do not know what it is. <br><br>  I apologize for the confusion.  The pillow is next to the clave. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the entire post is duplicated from the commentary (at the time of its publication, there was not enough karma for the post).  I hope the post will be useful to someone :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/123768/">https://habr.com/ru/post/123768/</a></p>
