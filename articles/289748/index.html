And we are ready to take the final step to become a full-fledged designer of educational mobile applications ... <br><br>  The history of <b>My University</b> as a project has more than one year.  The ideas underlying it all this time have evolved and transformed along with the development of the project itself - from a mobile application for university students <a href="http://www.pcweek.ru/mobile/article/detail.php%3FID%3D138674">in a pocket, presented on the Apps4All forum in 2012</a> , to a technology platform that simplifies the creation of educational mobile applications using <a href="http://dev.moyuniver.ru/doc/api/start/">My REST API Univer</a> .

      Today we are closer than ever to becoming a full-fledged educational platform that can simplify the creation of educational applications up to 1 click, at the same time allowing you to create much more complex projects, such as corporate universities, in just a few days.  All this became possible thanks to the introduction of modern software development concepts into education - from cloud platforms to mobile application designers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The main idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãMy University is to give <b>everyone the</b> opportunity to publish their content in the form of a professionally designed <b>educational product</b> .  This task is solved by the designer of educational mobile applications, which allows you to publish your application to any person (and, first of all, to a teacher) who does not have programming skills. <br><br>  But we decided not to dwell on this, and to make a <b>platform</b> that implements the capabilities of applications <b>available for use as services</b> .  Thus, with minimal knowledge of programming, it becomes possible to quickly and easily create more complex educational products that go beyond pre-prepared templates. <br><br>  Developing applications on the platform of My University is really easy - Artyom Ryzhkin, a 4th year student who created quite a popular application as a term paper, confirmed this first. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.com.gmail.phoeniks346.findermyuniver">I want to know everything</a> (more than 13,000 downloads on Google Play).  Later on, Artyom joined the project team and published <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer%3Fid%3DArgus-M">15 more Android applications</a> in the direction he opened under the name <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search%3Fq%3D%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%26c%3Dapps">Expert</a> . <br><br>  At the same time, the simplicity of development does not harm the quality of the product being created.  This is confirmed by a corporate university created by us in the framework of a pilot project in the form of a web service and a mobile application in just <b>4 days</b> , and providing training for <b>more than 1,800</b> people in 400 branches of the company-customer all over Russia. <br><br>  An important difference between My University and similar platforms is the fact that these are not only technological solutions that are available as services through <a href="http://dev.moyuniver.ru/doc/api/start/">My University's REST API</a> , but also <b>content</b> and <b>audience</b> - the components necessary for the successful launch of any educational project.  Thus, by creating an educational application with the help of My University, you can not only get a ready-made solution of technical problems out of the box, but also satisfy the need for educational content, and most importantly, get instant access to the segmented target audience of your potential users. <br><br>  By the way, already now the users of My University are in <b>19</b> countries and represent <b>more than 1,700</b> different educational institutions.  And every day they are becoming more and more.  And the users themselves are segmented not only by geography (and the educational institutions in which they study), but also by their learning preferences.  Simply put, we know not only <b>where the</b> user learns, but <b>what content is</b> most in demand in the learning process. <br><br>  The basis of the content of My University is a <a href="http://www.moyuniver.ru/otvety/">structured factual knowledge base</a> , which allows not only to quickly find the necessary portions of knowledge, but also to automate the process of creating verification materials, in other words <b>tests</b> .  At the same time, using <b>facts</b> as a basic unit of content allows you to form more complex entities from them using various <b>techniques</b> , which are algorithmic logic embedded in the designers of educational materials and application mechanics.  The knowledge base of My University is constantly expanding, and covers <b>more than 600 items</b> (both humanitarian and technical). <br><br>  Together, this creates unique opportunities for creating new educational products and their delivery to the final consumer.  All that is required is to <a href="http://moyuniver.ru/">connect to My Univer</a> ! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289748/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289748/</a></p>
