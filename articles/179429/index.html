      As a comment to the article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/178781/">Designing a Payment System,</a> I want to express my opinion. <br><br>  Digression: Before reading this article, I recommend reading also the article The <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/176037/">economic future of Bitcoin in 10-20 years and further</a> in which it is very intelligibly explained where the money came from and what it all is like. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now for the article itself, the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/178781/">design of the payment system</a> .  I like the general idea, but, in my opinion, the way of evaluating labor in Joules (Electrojoules) is not correct.  Still, money (means of payment) cannot be strictly tied to one resource (including one energy resource). <br><br>  Judging by various materials on the Internet, the 2008 crisis in the United States and the crisis of 2010 in Russia are only the beginning of the global economic crisis.  (I don‚Äôt provide links to not be considered for advertising and, moreover, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/info/help/rules/">Habr is not for politics</a> ).  However, you need to do something about it. <br><br>  Namely, you need to find a convenient and reliable way to pay for various ‚Äúbenefits‚Äù, you need a convenient tool for investing, you need a convenient means of accumulation.  In general, you need a reliable system that can fulfill the role of money.  I note that here I mean money as a free payment instrument, and not as a tool for managing people.  (I will not develop this topic here in detail.) <br><br><h4>  Disadvantages of the existing system </h4><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/robux/">robux</a> in the article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/178781/">Designing a Payment System</a> wrote: <br><blockquote>  System flaws <br>  1) lack of money by a specific guarantor <br>  2) currency war, swing rates <br>  3) global centralization of emissions in the US Federal Reserve System <br>  4) suppression of autoemission, suppression of alternative emitting centers <br>  5) degeneration of the international distributed system of debt receipts <br></blockquote><br>  Some points are controversial, but the insecurity of almost all existing modern money is clear to many (though not all).  A little more about this can be found in Wikipedia: <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%258C%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8">Fiat money</a> , <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D1%258E%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">Money illusion</a> .  And, as an example of real money, I suggest to look at the following link: <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2587%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581">Itak hour</a> . <br><br>  I would point out the following disadvantages of the existing system *: <br>  1) lack of money; <br>  2) centralization of emissions; <br>  3) as a result, the suppression of alternative emitting centers in various ways (up to direct military aggression); <br>  4) a very non-transparent distribution of new money received during emission. <br><br>  * Apparently, at the moment we have one monetary system (FRS), but in the future it is possible the emergence of similar large settlement systems with emissions independent of the Fed.  But it is not so important.  The main thing is not the provision of ‚Äútsiferok‚Äù as if they were not called and whoever issued them. <br><br><h4>  What are the alternatives? </h4><br>  We list the real money: <br>  1. Material resources (gold, silver, oil, salt, matches, <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0_%2528%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B0%2529">animal skins</a> ); <br>  2. Time ( <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2587%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581">Itak hour</a> ); <br>  3. Knowledge. <br><br>  Consider each option in more detail. <br><br><h5>  Material resources </h5><br>  Material resources at all times were considered a good means of payment.  I note that the category of real money can also be attributed to Electrojoule proposed in the article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/178781/">Designing a Payment System</a> .  But material resources are not always convenient for calculations. <br><br>  For example, you have a ton of coal and you need to cut your hair.  But the barber does not need coal.  He needs, let's say, bread.  But the baker doesn‚Äôt need trimming or coal.  In general, you need to create complex chains for the exchange of natural goods.  It is not comfortable. <br><br>  As a universal means of payment, it is possible to use rare long-term materials (gold, silver, rare shells, etc.).  But this is not always convenient, because  There are serious risks in transferring the payment instrument from the buyer to the seller (theft, heavy to carry with you a significant amount). <br><br>  You can store gold in a safe place (in the bank), and for calculations use a paper bank receipt (banknote) with confirmation that gold in the specified amount is actually stored in the specified bank.  However, as you know, people are greedy and the bankers at one time learned how to dispose of someone else's gold as their means of issuing credit resources that are not secured by real resources. <br><br><h5>  Time </h5><br>  Time (more precisely, <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25E0%25E1%25EE%25F7%25E5%25E5_%25E2%25F0%25E5%25EC%25FF">Working Time</a> ) is an interesting payment resource.  But each person works differently.  And even the same work can be done with different results.  Still, it is more correct to evaluate labor, not wasted time or wasted energy, but to evaluate the usefulness of the result. <br><br><h5>  Knowledge </h5><br>  Knowledge is a very important value.  But at the moment it is not clear how they can be quantified.  As an example of using knowledge as real value, various production technologies (including technologies for creating program code), as well as <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25C1%25E8%25E7%25ED%25E5%25F1-%25EF%25F0%25EE%25F6%25E5%25F1%25F1">business processes,</a> can be cited.  To create a business you need to have knowledge of all the processes of operation of this business.  But the assessment of business processes is also very difficult. <br><br>  However, I believe that knowledge, as real value is very important.  And perhaps sometime knowledge will become real wealth, and the transfer of knowledge will become a universal means of payment.  Moreover, how to produce knowledge emission (Knowledge Mining) and how to evaluate the quality of knowledge is not entirely clear. <br><br><h4>  But what about Bitcoin? </h4><br>  There were comments to the article ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/178781/">Payment system design</a> ) that Bitcoin is much more understandable, the emission is stable and rigidly given by the algorithm, etc.  Naturally, computing resources of computers for ‚Äúearning‚Äù bitcoins would be better spent on more useful calculations, but at the moment the Bitcoin system is closest to the ideal money. <br><br>  However, I will try to list what are the disadvantages of the Bitcoin system: <br>  1. Computational resources are spent absolutely ineptly.  In fact, the computing power heats the air for the chance of getting a block. <br>  2. Issuing new money is not for really useful work, but as if it is a lottery (I want to write a scam). <br>  3. The emission of funds gradually slows down, which will result from natural deflation. <br><br>  Wikipedia: <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25C4%25E5%25F4%25EB%25FF%25F6%25E8%25FF_%2528%25FD%25EA%25EE%25ED%25EE%25EC%25E8%25EA%25E0%2529)">Deflation</a> - increasing the purchasing power of the local currency, which is manifested in a decrease in the price index.  In fact, deflation is inflation with a negative price growth rate.  However, for several reasons, it is regarded as less favorable factor than inflation. <br><br>  Deflation is dangerous in that it becomes advantageous to keep money in the ‚Äúpot‚Äù (accumulate funds), and not spend it.  Why do something if the available money only becomes more expensive.  This leads to a fall in the turnover of money and, as a result, to a fall in the growth of production and the economy as a whole. <br><br>  Continued: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/179701/">KriyaMoney.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/179701/">Part 2.
