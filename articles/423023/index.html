He graduated from the Faculty of Mathematics at the Orenburg State University.  Even then, it was interesting to me to observe the work of our teachers.  The university used as an example senior students who settled in Yandex, Microsoft and other large companies.  Therefore, after graduating from university, I wanted to get a job in Yandex.  In 2013, he moved to St. Petersburg and got a job at Yandex as a tester.  First, in Yandex. Mail, and then in Yandex. Disk.  All this time I continued to program for myself and at the same time take online courses.  In October 2015, I got a job at Wargaming as an automator of testing, and in February 2017 I was offered to teach Python lectures in Netology.  I immediately agreed, since it was always interesting to me.

    <h3>  Why do you teach? </h3><br>  Teaching people, you should always learn yourself, because students can ask non-obvious questions, and their own learning process goes so much better. <br><br><blockquote>  In 2018, I was promoted at Wargaming to the head of the automation department.  In part, I associate this with work in Netology, since here you constantly need to be in good shape and engage in self-education. </blockquote><br>  I also trained the staff at the main job.  This is where the Netology experience came in handy.  Teaching helps develop communication and performance skills.  Constantly there are new people with their own stories, and each group is not like the previous one. <br><br><h3>  How do you combine with the main work? </h3><br>  I finish the main work at 19:00.  After that, I'm not leaving the office, but I continue to work with Netology.  I lecture, check homework, communicate with students, plan lectures. <br><br><blockquote>  While going to the subway, instead of playing it is better to read an article or a chapter from a book.  Similarly, with work in Netology: every day after work, I check homework for 1-2 hours, communicate with students or think through lectures. </blockquote><br><h3>  Who do you advise to try to teach? </h3><br>  Those professionals whose work has become a routine and they want something new.  In fact, we do not change our subject area, continue to be in IT and at the same time try ourselves in another profession. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bniwredyc">Igor Lobanov</a> </h2><br>  <b>Position:</b> Senior Developer at OneTwoTrip. <br>  <b>In Netology:</b> lecturer and trainer in courses on <a href="https://netology.ru/programs/react">React</a> and <a href="https://netology.ru/programs/javascript">JavaScript</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ez/bo/dg/ezbodgfx_vt57dri7mu7ehwv7ho.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  How did you get into teaching? </h3><br>  I met an employee of Netology at the birthday of a mutual friend.  I was told that I had to go to teach in Netology, and I went to try something new, also for money. <br><br><h3>  Why do you teach? </h3><br>  I teach because I know some areas well, and I want to share this knowledge.  Reading lectures, I see how my skill of performance grows.  During lectures, students ask different questions, so you have to study the topic thoroughly and know all the subtleties, it helps in the work. <br><br>  During the diploma check, I see students learning something from me.  And still sometimes students after the diploma send touching messages with thanks.  It's nice. <br><br><h3>  How do you combine with the main work? </h3><br>  Combining with work is easy: Netology takes 3-4 hours per week.  Lecture with preparation - 1,5‚Äì2 hours, diploma check - 15‚Äì45 minutes for a diploma depending on the level of the student. <br><br><blockquote>  At the main work, lecturing in Netology is encouraged, since I am pumping up my teaching skills and can better help our junas.  Plus, this is an advertisement of the company, and after training students can try to get us an internship. </blockquote><br><h3>  Who do you advise to try to teach? </h3><br>  Those who know their area well and want to share knowledge. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://www.mobila.name/">Mikhail Larchenko</a> </h2><br>  <b>Position:</b> tech lead in Sytac (Amsterdam). <br>  <b>In Netology: a</b> lecturer and trainer in courses on <a href="https://netology.ru/programs/react">React</a> and CSS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xr/rh/65/xrrh652zs0-7isaq0wzpb3nii_u.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  How did you get into teaching? </h3><br>  I took the first steps towards teaching in Minsk.  My colleague advised me as a front-line instructor in a Belarusian company.  Then there were workshops, lectures, and so on.  There was another attempt to involve me in teaching at the ‚ÄúEducational Center of the High-Tech Park‚Äù in Minsk, but I refused, since this is a state enterprise, and there is a big bureaucracy.  There was no time or desire for this. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt remember at all how I got into Netology, but it seems through Facebook.  I was contacted and offered to try. <br><br><h3>  Why do you teach? </h3><br>  I like to teach.  I love talking to people, even if it's just a monologue.  I want to share knowledge.  This is also a good practice for speaking at conferences - speech is training.  I don't often speak Russian on work topics, so this is also the practice of communicating with colleagues. <br><br>  In my youth I worked in journalism.  From there I took the habit of being able to explain things in a clear language.  In teaching programming, on the contrary, processes are described by technical and mathematical terms.  For beginners it is hard.  So, I like to explain everything with the simplest words so that each student can understand. <br><br><h3>  How do you combine with the main work? </h3><br><blockquote>  Many ask how long teaching takes.  In fact, not so much.  Since the lectures themselves last 1 hour and are repeated, then in preparation for the lesson I need no more than 15 minutes to run through the presentation. </blockquote><br>  It takes more time to check homework - it takes 10‚Äì15 minutes per check.  There is not a lot of code, but if it is incorrect or there are comments, you need to write about it to the student and disassemble his error with examples in an accessible form. <br><br><h3>  Who do you advise to try to teach? </h3><br>  I would advise to teach people with good knowledge and an average level of communication in order to bring up this communication.  Since this is often a monologue, you can prepare for it in advance.  I would also like to be taught by as many people as possible with well-suspended language and deep knowledge and experience.  There are many situations and issues in programming that are quickly solved only when there is enough experience.  Teachers with experience can pass it on to the younger generation. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/vladimir.yazykov">Vladimir Yazykov</a> </h2><br>  <b>Position:</b> web developer at S7, Tele2, VTB. <br>  <b>In Netology:</b> lecturer, trainer and developer of courses on <a href="https://netology.ru/programs/javascript">JavaScript</a> , <a href="https://netology.ru/programs/php-sql">PHP</a> , <a href="https://netology.ru/programs/web-developer">web development</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/id/rt/1e/idrt1eqcfcuvihybfb55hhsuf8s.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  How did you get into teaching? </h3><br>  I have been learning for a long time since 2009.  Then, as a second year student at the Moscow Aviation Institute, I got a job at the Physicotechnical College, where I taught various IT disciplines to students in grades 5‚Äì11: Flash, Photoshop, C #, computer basics, web programming.  Then, in parallel with the projects for the S7, I considered the FTC as an extra income, without thinking about the ambitious plans. <br><br>  I discovered the interest in teaching as a way to change life when I taught a course in web development for high school students.  Since then I have been studying, and in September it was half a year, as I cooperate with the Netology. <br><br><h3>  Why do you teach? </h3><br>  The work of an IT specialist is hard work requiring great concentration and concentration.  Considering the cumulative effect, this can lead to isolation and social disunity.  For me, this is unacceptable.  I love people and communication too much and am not ready to sacrifice communication for the sake of work. <br><br>  It is also important for me to be useful to people.  I have catastrophically little time to bring all large-scale plans to life, and I understand that when developing projects for clients, I will have to give up some.  Even with a large team of Google staff, we cannot do as much as I can train in the future. <br><br><h3>  How do you combine with the main work? </h3><br>  Combining education and work is a difficult but interesting process.  For such things, I have a diary and a day that starts at six in the morning and ends at one in the morning.  I still cannot live to wear out - an important part of my life is family and aikido training.  In my case, keeping up with everything is not a task, but a desire and a necessity. <br><br><h3>  Who do you advise to try to teach? </h3><br>  It is worth going to teaching if: <br><br><ol><li>  You love people. </li><li>  You do not like people, but really want to love them. </li><li>  You dream of a bright future for all people. </li></ol><br><blockquote>  And where is the money?  Money is the gratitude of people for doing something right and good;  side effect of employment necessary and useful work. </blockquote><br><h2>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/webmax">Maxim Salnikov</a> </h2><br>  <b>Position:</b> fullstack developer at ForgeRock, managing partner at Mobile Era Conference. <br>  <b>In Netology:</b> lecturer and course developer on <a href="https://netology.ru/programs/javascript">JavaScript</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/db/1t/ms/db1tmspq7681sxmsie6tbz7qnrg.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  How did you get into teaching? </h3><br>  I enjoy learning the most advanced approaches to building modern web applications and sharing knowledge and experience with the audience. <br><br><blockquote>  Teaching fits in perfectly with my love of travel.  For several years of speaking at conferences, I have traveled all over the world: from Tokyo to Los Angeles. </blockquote><br>  Workshops were added to the presentations, where each of the participants, during my full day, under my leadership, immersed in the study of the subject in practice.  At the same time, I always wanted to try other learning formats, so I accepted the suggestion to try online teaching with enthusiasm. <br><br><h3>  Why do you teach? </h3><br>  The main value of conducting courses for me is feeling like a part of the developer community and expanding the range of professional contacts.  I am convinced that the times of lonely characters in the world of programming, and especially in the web front-end, are over. <br><br><blockquote>  In order to remain an in-demand specialist and enjoy work, I learn something new every day: I communicate with other developers, read and comment on articles of my colleagues, attend and organize meetings and conferences. </blockquote><br><h3>  How do you combine with the main work? </h3><br>  The most difficult part is creating a course, and keeping it up-to-date is not so labor-intensive.  With proper time management, combining the main work of a web developer with lectures is easy.  I take video tutorials not as a job, but as friendly experience-sharing meetings, and their schedule is easily adjusted to my work schedule and travel. <br><br><h3>  Who do you advise to try to teach? </h3><br>  I share the opinion that the ability to talk about a complex phenomenon in a simple and understandable language is one of the significant indicators that you really understand the subject.  So the development of the course itself, conducting classes and waiting for questions of all levels of complexity from students is an excellent motivation to explore the material more deeply. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/423023/">https://habr.com/ru/post/423023/</a></p>
