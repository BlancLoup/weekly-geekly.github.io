      <br>
      Let's look at how Yandex.Direct works with a simple example.  Suppose we sell upholstered furniture.  What are we doing?  To do this, we register an advertising account in Yandex.Direct, compose an ad with the text ‚ÄúSell the most furniture furniture in the country‚Äù, buy the word ‚Äúfurniture‚Äù (or request) from Yandex and every day when our beloved user (he is a potential buyer) enters In the search bar of Yandex, the cherished word ‚Äúfurniture‚Äù and pokes the ‚Äúfind!‚Äù button - a mini-miracle happens. <br><br>  Yandex Direct rummages in its list of ads and pulls out our ad, showing it in one place or another.  Further, the potential buyer clicks on the ad, gets to our site, which, quite possibly, he will like it and he will make a purchase.  At first glance, everything is organized quite simply. <br><br>  But there are two small ‚Äúbut‚Äù that can upset a beginner: <br><br>  1. Competition.  We are not alone in the desire to sell furniture. <br><br>  2. Assortment.  If you think about it, it turns out that the furniture is different: from bedside tables for $ 50 / kg.  to wardrobes for $ 3000 / pcs.  In the throes of choice, the buyer will rush among the sites, like a basketball, and not the fact that in the end it will fly into our basket. <br><br>  <b>The cost of advertising in Direct: how much click for the people?</b> <br><br>  Remember, and better write it down.  Direct bids depend on the <b>CTR</b> (click-through rate is the ‚Äúquality‚Äù parameter), which shows the ratio of the number of impressions to the number of conversions (clicks) on your ad. <br><br>  For example, if there were 100 ad impressions (request) and 10 clicks on it, then the CTR of the ad (request) is 10%.  Ads for display are ranked with the help of the magical rule (simplified). <br><br> <code>   CTR          -        <br></code> <br><br>  Other things being equal, if you have a CTR = 10% with a competitor, then an ad with a higher bid will appear on the vantage point.  Conclusion: the higher the CTR of the ad, the sweeter the life.  But alas, not always (about this, too, later). <br><br>  <b>The first conclusion:</b> in Yandex Direct there is competition, which sometimes turns into a scuffle.  At the same time, Yandex itself observes everything that happens with a sweet smile on its face and, as it were, establishes uniform conditions for the game for all advertisers. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion two:</b> Yandex.Direct advertising is an everyday monitoring of competitors and an analysis of the market situation.  And forget about the high quality of your product, it does not interest anyone. <br><br>  <b>Third conclusion:</b> do not spray.  If the assortment of your store - sofas, walls and children's furniture - you are required to show ads to those who are looking for exactly these products.  Broadcasting on requests "country furniture", "bedroom furniture", etc.  - pointless exercise, leading to higher click prices and lower CTR. <br><br>  Some naive advertisers will say, ‚ÄúWhat's the difference?  Well, he sees my ad for the query "bedroom furniture", so what?  There will not be a click!  And we only pay per click, so that's okay. ‚Äù <br><br>  The answer is simple: every time a visitor sees an ad, but does not click on it, the ad has an increased number of impressions (see above about CTR).  Thus, the CTR deteriorates.  With the increase in the number of such shows, the rates required to take one position or another for you are beginning to rise, while among competitors who have more carefully approached the preparation of the RC they remain the same. <br><br>  <b>The fourth conclusion:</b> Empty impressions of a non-target audience are evil, as they inevitably lead to an increase in the cost of a click. <br><br>  Direct, like any advertising channel, is not without flaws <br><br>  1. Rich competitors (leads to a temporary, sometimes significant increase in costs); <br>  2. Rich and smart competitors (can lead a novice advertiser to think about their economic worthlessness); <br>  3. The probability of slipping competitors.  The problem is solved by technical means, but it takes time. <br>  4. The slowdown of statistics (alas, the lack of large and complex systems); <br>  5. Some more horror stories, about which, perhaps, we will keep silent. <br><br>  And now five news, and all good <br><br>  Efficiency-1.  Today I placed an ad, and after 30 minutes you risk sitting at the cash register and yelling what is ‚ÄúFree cash!‚Äù Urine.  Compare with 2 months (those who know and correct them) for optimization, which go to ‚Äúoutput to the TOP such and such‚Äù.  But often the optimization process ends with the question "Where is my loot?". <br><br>  Efficiency-2.  Advertising in Yandex Direct today - the shortest, relatively inexpensive and effective way to the wallets of adored customers. <br><br>  Mobility.  The ability to always be in the know and influence the "course of history."  Change texts, bids, turn campaigns on and off, add new requests.  Not only is this right, it‚Äôs also very interesting!  At the same time learn to understand your customers, your business and hateful competitors. <br><br>  Simplicity (or more correctly intelligence) A wonderful opportunity to communicate with the client in the "here and now" format: tell them about all sorts of promotions, new prices, sales for retirees, throw mud at nearby announcements, competitors and other villains; <br><br>  Awesome profitability at the appropriate margin level in the transaction.  You invest a little (money, but not brains) - you earn a lot.  And what about competitors?  Competitors, as they should be, quietly smoke on the sidelines. <br><br>  Well, isn't every businessman dreaming about this? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93845/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93845/</a></p>
