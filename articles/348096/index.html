  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Orgi among programmers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> When I studied at the university, at the technical faculty, then among us, the future engineers, there were such special people - all sorts of - ORGI.  Now I don‚Äôt remember exactly all the varieties, but there were definitely sportgroups and kultorgi. <br><br>  Formally, they also studied engineering, sometimes went to lectures and laboratory work, but they had problems with academic performance.  They did not understand the electronics, they could only write off the databases, I personally did them for the course in optical measurements for money, the assembler ‚Äî I don‚Äôt even know how they passed. <br><br>  After the university, our paths diverged, I lost sight of these orgovs - I thought they were dissolved somewhere in managers or politicians.  My opinion was strengthened by the fact that I personally knew one org, who now works in the highest echelons of power, and another familiar org made a career in some kind of youth movement (Young Guard, it seems).  The rest, I thought, went the same way.

      And here, on the beloved Habr√©, I discover this miracle - a person who calls himself a programmer and an engineer, says that we all produce some kind of <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/344844/">surrogates here</a> .  I was so surprised at this unexpected meeting with (probably) the former org that I could not remain silent.  So it is impossible, friends! <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Org or not org the author of that particular article - I do not know, and this is not important (although, the rest of his publications only convinced me of the conclusions made).  Another thing is important - these guys are now among us, and they continue to follow the principle that was still learned in high school: if it does not work, look for the left topic and study it, without departing from the cash register! <br><br>  After all, it was like that at the university.  It is impossible to learn, and a sense of self-importance rolls over - it does not matter!  Let the losers sit and ponder the theory of measurements, statistical analysis, strength of materials and digital electronics, and I will find another topic. <br><br>  And so full, even for a full felt boot.  No, well, if there is a talent - in sports, music, any invention - I can understand it, although I accept it with difficulty.  Well, you need a university, for some reason, to have a football team and your own choir - their work. <br><br>  And if there is no talent, then there will always be the same organizational work - for the organ.  Mind does not need much, congestion is not fulltime, but the bonuses are simply awesome!  After all, work from the dean's office is underway, and if you are lucky, it also comes from the trade union committee of students.  And this is help with the session, right up to the intervention of the dean, if some stubborn teacher gets caught, believing that the student should learn, and not sing songs in a chorus.  I'm not talking about all sorts of vouchers for the sea for 1 thousand rubles, food stamps in the dining room for free, free travel (as for business, you have to go, organize), etc. <br><br>  It seems everything is nothing, everyone decides how to live.  But why do you, orgi, then go to programmers and engineers, and prevent them from living and working normally?  You don‚Äôt work yourself, and it will never work out - after all, we ran through all the lectures, didn‚Äôt do a single coursework, there is no foundation of knowledge at all!  And you know that. <br><br>  But you do not want to lose work, you turn on your org-brain again, and start looking for a topic.  Oh, oh, and now there is no problem!  It is enough to read a couple of books and say: programmers, you are not working well!  Sometimes it‚Äôs not necessary to read, it‚Äôs enough to meet in the company of another organization.  They probably somehow know how to recognize each other like fishermen. <br><br>  And God forbid such an org crawls to the director, and, as they say, sits down in his ear - that's all, hang yourself, miserable.  And better run, your company has infected org-virus. <br><br>  This virus shifts the system of values ‚Äã‚Äã- exactly the same as it was in the university.  All students thought that a good one who studies well is no!  The one who is the org is good!  And your fives, an increased scholarship for several years in a row, a red diploma in the end - it's all boring, mediocre, like everyone else. <br><br>  I know exactly what I'm talking about, because  once I decided to try to get a free ticket to the sea - my friends advised.  They said that with my academic performance is not a problem at all.  It turned out the problem, and even some! <br><br>  I got a ticket with a grief in half, and we got a whole second-class carriage.  Guess how many more people rode in that car "for good performance"?  Zero!  No one! <br>  But now this junk - a whole car, who just was not!  And dancers, and singers, and athletes, and even one man of about 30 years old, to whom a friend has knocked out a ticket - a full-time org, again. <br><br>  What do these young, immature minds endure from the university?  ‚ÄúWork is for fools‚Äù - that's what they endure.  They know for sure - they have experienced it - it is much more profitable not to plow by sweat, but just sit down on the right topic, and everything will turn out more than successful. <br><br>  Or as the same surrogate author: programmers, you make garbage that nobody needs!  It‚Äôs your fault, you don‚Äôt think about the benefits of some businesses, you need a formal TK, what fuckers! <br><br>  For training or director sounds quite good - they clap their hands.  But, friend org, you are not only confused to read.  We did not miss the lectures, and we know what the division of labor is. <br><br>  Any employee, not necessarily a programmer, can be accused of not achieving business goals.  This is just a verbal exercise with a psychological bias - the induction of a feeling of guilt is called.  You collect 100 people, you say that they are guilty of something, and quite a significant percentage will really lead.  Orgi among managers have taught us this - they themselves are never to blame. <br><br>  The programmer must program.  Point.  Everything else that is trying to hang on him - just an attempt to manipulate and exalt themselves.  Exactly as in the university - the shift of the system of values, so that others sank, and the org rose. <br><br>  If the programmer is responsible for the goals of the business, then half of the remaining employees must be dispersed, starting with the managers.  If the manager - internal or external, it does not matter - with the decomposition of the goal loses this very goal, then where is the programmer?  It is his job as a manager to set goals for tasks.  His job!  This is just a job, this is not magic, there is a lot of material and methods on this subject.  The manager did not read?  Also an org?  I grabbed the upper hand, how to sign accounts and define ‚Äúreference points‚Äù, and climbs into the management of development? <br><br>  Why in the incompetence of everything and everything suddenly became a programmer to blame?  Well, I know why - because the org is also listed as a programmer.  If you rummage on the forums of power engineers, mining engineers, or designers of navigation devices, then there will also be similar ‚Äúprophets‚Äù who assure the others that they are not working properly? <br><br>  This is a common, banal attempt to shift from a sick head to a healthy one.  It does not work for managers - let the programmers deal.  And let the programmers determine the goals of the business.  And managers will only read books, and give programmers a chance - well, they say, look, you also miss it, and then you work incorrectly, and you don‚Äôt stick ostrich feathers in your pants. <br><br>  I‚Äôm sure that the org programmer didn‚Äôt study the division of labor, doesn‚Äôt know about the principles of development and roles in the team, and didn‚Äôt do any worthwhile pr in the github do).  But teaches us how to live is necessary. <br><br>  Once again I clearly pronounce: I have nothing personally against the author of the surrogates.  I am worried about the trend and systemic phenomenon. <br><br>  Finally, a bit of classics on this topic.  Programmers and engineers of my age will understand. <br><br>  <i>What is this your devastation?</i>  <i>An old woman with a stick?</i>  <i>The witch who knocked out all the glass, put out all the lamps?</i>  <i>Yes, it does not exist at all.</i>  <i>What do you mean by this word?</i>  <i>[...] That's what: if I, instead of operating every evening, start in my apartment sing in chorus, I will be ruined.</i>  <i>If I enter the lavatory and begin to excuse the expression, urinating past the toilet and Zina and Darya Petrovna will do the same, ruin will begin in the lavatory.</i>  <i>Consequently, the devastation is not in the closet, but in the heads.</i>  <i>So, when these baritones shout "beat devastation!" - I laugh.</i>  <i>[...] I swear to you, I find it funny!</i>  <i>This means that each of them must thump himself on the back of the head!</i>  <i>And now, when he hatches all sorts of hallucinations and does the cleaning of the sheds ‚Äî his own business ‚Äî the ruin will disappear of itself.</i>  <i>Two gods can not serve!</i>  <i>It is impossible to sweep the tram tracks at one time and arrange the fate of some foreign beggars!</i>  <i>No one succeeds in doing this, doctor, and even more so - people who, generally lagging behind in development from Europeans by about 200 years, are still not quite confidently buttoning their own pants!</i>  ( <a href="https://ru.wikiquote.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B0%25D1%2587%25D1%258C%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B4%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5">source</a> ) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/348096/">https://habr.com/ru/post/348096/</a></p>
