Outside, a purple evening sun was breaking through to the house, imprinting on the wall the shadow of the bent blinds and a trickle of melting summer air.  The empty kitchen-living room froze in the dusk.  On the screen flashed cars that participated in the race for survival - the track in the form of "eight", with a ramp for jumping at the central intersection, forced the participants to perform risky maneuvers: who could not accelerate for a normal jump, hit the roofs of cars traveling across.  The audience at the stadium and Rick at the monitor were waiting for a spectacular accident. <br><br>  He watched and thought that such shows are now one of the few outlets where a real driving drive remained.  After all, this happened ... so imperceptibly, about how some models of cars disappear from the roads.  Suddenly, you look around and understand: and there are no more buses that you drove to during your school years, or some inexpensive car that half of the students and office workers had about ten years ago.  Only this time not the cars, but the drivers. <a name="habracut"></a>  It seems that not so long ago, the first vigorous television reports about the introduction of unmanned cars on public roads were going.  A couple of years ago, his neighbor on the street, always going somewhere to relax or to relatives with his wife and three children on his permanent minivan, sold it and said that it was safer to travel on autopilot taxi.  School friend Earl, who had a workshop first, and then a car rental, went bankrupt and lost his job.  Unmanned taxis so desperately shared the market with rental services, except that they themselves did not pay customers for the trip, and nobody rented cars for rent from small private owners.  Here's Handsome Edward got a job: used his charisma to become a limousine driver.  Under the guise of expensive service for demanding customers, she continues to do what the soul is about: she cuts through the city at the wheel, satisfying her passion for stylish cars.  However, it is a sin to complain to Rick - he also stayed with his beloved business, in time he received certification for the repair of unaccustomed electric cars.  The workshop near the house brings enough money, besides it remains the basis for his hobby - to restore old cars.

      A sharp sound came from outside, forcing Rick to wince and turn around - a long, uninterrupted, something in between a ring of those old home telephones with a tube from his childhood and a siren police car.  The sound did not stop until Rick, swallowing from the unpleasant chill of fright, looked around for the source.  Coming out into the hallway, he froze for a second at the sight of a large black figure behind the curtained glass of the front door.  But the harsh blue LEDs on the black silhouette and the silent artificial signal calmed him down.  Damn the robot did not recognize the doorbell button, so he calls himself as best he can.  Thank you, at least I did not knock on the door with my fist, tearing off the paint from it.  But that's what he wants?  He waited for the delivery of the ignition switch for his 1995 Caprice in a week, and it would have been brought by a dog or a wheeled robot, and not an android. <br>  The man abruptly opened the door outside, and the android obediently recoiled, letting the man out.  From the doorway, he saw that an imposing black autopilot truck with a silver H logo was parked not far away on the roadside. <br><br>  - Richard Dale Bennet.  Hello, - said the android with an uncertain, mechanical intonation.  He lit a small bright diode, apparently for the convenience of face recognition camera.  - I am a full representative of Hudsonbot.  Please consent to the processing of personal data. <br><br>  In his pocket shortstop smartphone shuddered.  Rick pulled him out and, with two sharp movements of his thumb, squandered a standard agreement, turning his eyes away from the robot only for a moment to put a digital signature.  He did not like this dubious practice of ‚Äúagreement first, then conversation‚Äù, but, like many, he believed the popular myth that it was enough not to confirm his identity out loud under the camera.  He just looked at the android in silence. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù continued the android.  - I, as a full representative of the company "Hudsonbot."  I want to offer you a contract with us. <br><br>  - What is the contract?  - Rick was surprised, not going to talk at all with the robot.  These words were a complete surprise to him. <br><br>  - You can re-read.  With the terms of the contract, - answered the android under the short buzz of the smartphone in your pocket.  - Our business proposal, an electronic contract, details of a business plan three times in number.  Monthly sent to your email.  Amended to current economic conditions and forecasts.  However, due to certain circumstances, you did not open the letter.  What can be seen in the absence of a positive or negative response to the letter opening script.  Therefore, it is considered appropriate to convey information personally. <br><br>  ‚ÄúDescribe briefly the essence of the sentence,‚Äù Rick said, and he felt a little uncomfortable, as if he, having become like a robot, turned on a conversation mode with similar dry and simple phrases. <br><br>  - Richard Bennett, according to the Tax Administration.  You are a car master by occupation.  According to the Ministry of Transport.  You are the owner of standard certified equipment in a car repair shop.  And.  A set of qualification certificates for the production of plumbing and body work.  For cars up to the category of 119.9 cubic feet.  Our company "Hudsonbot" offers the purchase of your business.  For re-equipment of the production unit under our franchise.  With a reward personally to you monthly in the amount of 50% of current profits.  Taking into account your previous taxation on this type of activity.  For life. <br><br>  - Stop stop.  - Rick looked away, blinking, then stared at the android.  - What is a franchise?  Why do you need my workshop?  Who wants to buy it? <br><br>  - Our company is one of the automated robotized network companies created under the state program ‚ÄúAI-optimization of medium-sized businesses‚Äù.  We are sponsored by the state to run an innovative business of increased productivity due to the lack of people in the company structure.  All profits go to the further development of the company ... <br><br>  Rick heard about this.  It seems like business projects are running all over the country under control of computer centers and with robots instead of employees.  The state generously subsidizes these projects to get whole industries without people.  Service, cleaning, delivery, driving - everything is automated, because it is profitable.  The salary of a robot is its timely repair, which is much cheaper than to buy his house, car, children, insurance, trips to the resort together with the worker‚Äôs labor ... It‚Äôs all logical, but that the robots themselves come to people to buy the business?  Rick squinted at the black truck that stood to one side.  Suddenly there are a dozen of such robots ready to break into his house? <br><br>  - You see, I do not want.  I am satisfied with my income and my work.  I like to repair cars.  And why should I sell you a workshop?  Rick exclaimed, spreading his arms. <br><br>  - According to marketing research.  The franchise is known throughout the country.  Branding will increase awareness.  - Rick rolled his eyes, clenched his lips, but the robot, who responded to the question "why", was unstoppable.  - According to the Tax Administration.  You do not have employees.  Robots can work around the clock unlike you.  According to the Ministry of Transport.  It is planned to build an exit from the interstate and a traffic interchange 10 miles from you.  Start of work within 8 months.  The increase in car traffic after completion of work by an average of 27%.  Taking into account the increased efficiency of work with robots, geolocation and improved transport accessibility.  Your workshop is a promising place.  In the case of a contract with Hudsonbot, your average monthly income will increase by an average of 57%.  For life. <br><br>  ‚ÄúListen, robot,‚Äù said Rick impatiently.  I understood everything and do not want to sell the workshop.  This is my hobby, understand?  I do it not only for money.  Not just for income.  I repair cars for myself!  I like it, understand?  No, you will not understand!  The conversation is over!  - He turned his back on the android, opening the door of the house. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThank you, Mr. Bennet, and have a good evening!‚Äù  - it was heard after him. <br>  As soon as he turned around and walked to the truck, the android connected to the freelance database, for a tenth of a second formed and sent an email.  Rick was still looking after the departing car when, fifty miles away, successful marketing psychologist David Sanders got up from the table after a family dinner, kissed his wife and went into his office behind a working tablet.  Sitting in a chair, he slowly read the last message. <br><br>  <i>Dear Mr. Sanders,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Hudsonbot requires your services as a psychologist to help our future partner, Mr. Bennett, conclude a contract with us.</i>  <i>The client was explained his prospects and benefits from the contract in person with the android.</i>  <i>The client expressed interest, wishing to get acquainted with the details of the agreement.</i>  <i>But from further communication and contracting refused.</i>  <i>Neural network registered an emotional reaction of rejection.</i>  <i>Possible reasons: stress from interaction with robots, the trauma of business alienation, loss of life prospects.</i>  <i>A competent marketing and psychological approach is needed to communicate information on mutual beneficiary to the client.</i>  <i>In case of successful conclusion of a contract between Hudsonbot and Mr. Bennett, through your present offer, you are guaranteed a bonus of 50% of the profit of its production unit under our franchise for the first month of its operation.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>A business proposal, an electronic contract and business plan details provided to Mr. Bennet, a video recording of communication with him (for possible psychological profiling and other tasks), as well as an agreement on the processing of personal data with the right of limited transfer to third parties, certified by its digital signature, are attached to this letter.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Wishing you all the best and with the hope of successful cooperation,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Hudsonbot Company</i> <br><br>  It was almost dark, and Rick, inhaling deeply cool air, walked toward the garage near the house where his workshop was located.  Glancing nervously at the road, where a black truck, with its robots ready to take away his workshop, had recently stood in a sinister form, he went inside. <br><br>  ‚ÄúA promising place,‚Äù he snorted, shaking his head.  A conversation with the android slightly inflated it with such an unexpected and uncompromising intrusion into his quiet life. <br>  In search of fresh batteries on the racks, he froze for a moment and looked out over the garage from the height of the ladder on which he stood.  The 1995 ‚ÄúCaprice‚Äù, which he gradually restored, was already covered with dust, but the two ‚ÄúModels A‚Äù standing side by side would not repair themselves - they should be delivered tomorrow evening.  On the other hand, what is there to repair?  Go through the battery assembly in search of non-working elements and make computer diagnostics of the motor-wheels?  Do people really can't even do this today? <br>  ‚ÄúA promising place,‚Äù he repeated, soundlessly, with his lips alone, removing a weighty box with pink batteries from the shelf. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/455308/">https://habr.com/ru/post/455308/</a></p>
