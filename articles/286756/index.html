    <blockquote>  If you do not know what you will live for a year or two while you start and take the first steps with your project, then you are not the kind of person who can be an entrepreneur.  There are two options - either you have your money, or you can live without money.  Get out the way you want - work on the project in the evenings, weekends, freelance, do whatever you want, but start by yourself.  Looking for an investment so that someone can pay for your life while you make your dream come true - infantile.  If you are not willing to risk a ‚Äúcar loan‚Äù, then it‚Äôs better not to start, and you don‚Äôt have to put these risks on someone else. </blockquote><br><br><h2>  All projects can be successful. </h2><br><blockquote>  I am sure that if the team is stubborn, then it will find how to make the project work or be able to turn 180 ¬∞ and find something that will work. </blockquote><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://coub.com/embed/2se50%3Fautoplay%3Dtrue%26maxheight%3D315%26maxwidth%3D560%26muted%3Dtrue&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhipxt9kcEx5xqxIme5UMtvczlSf4g" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" autoplay="true" width="560" height="315"></iframe><br><br><blockquote>  We worked on Kob for more than a year and we hardly had any traction.  The mood is terrible, hands are falling, but in the end we found how to reverse this situation.  The founders of Instagram did some other project and as a result were able to expand the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project in a completely different direction.  More difficulties and problems than the founders of Airbnb at an early stage of their project are hard to come up with, but they are now a billion-dollar company.  If you look closely, almost no one has easy success, most take obstinacy.  All the beautiful success stories are most often small insignificant components of the team‚Äôs titanic efforts.  There is a stupid saying: "If you suffer for a long time, something will work out."  Yes, the stubborn team will be able to find a way to make a successful project. </blockquote><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://coub.com/embed/21azl%3Fautoplay%3Dtrue%26maxheight%3D315%26maxwidth%3D560%26muted%3Dtrue&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh4LjsyRsOjU7-4Uzetn73TPOUJAg" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" autoplay="true" width="320" height="240"></iframe><br><br><h2>  All is bad </h2><br><blockquote>  We look at successful projects and we think that everything is good for them, and everything is bad for us.

So if everything is bad for you, then it‚Äôs at least the same as everyone‚Äôs, and you shouldn‚Äôt think that you are really special.

Somewhere there are specialists who claim that this will not work, the idea is stupid, or the project will not be able to earn.  Worst of all, this skepticism is met before the project is launched.  When Sergey and Larry launched Google - it was the most stupid idea.  The market was full (yahoo, altavista, go.com and so on), it was impossible to earn money on a search engine, then there was no contextual advertising.  The maximum that could be counted on is to sell / license technology to someone.  Snapchat - what could be dumber.
