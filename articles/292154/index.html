      SCT is a non-commercial event designed to determine the reasonableness and test the strength of key elements of IT start-ups.  At such events, participants, in addition to the ‚Äúsupport group‚Äù of speakers and teams of other start-ups, are also investors and representatives of business incubators who look out for promising projects and offer cooperation to their developers.  Beginning entrepreneurs, in turn, at SCT are guaranteed to receive an authoritative opinion on the strengths and weaknesses of their creations, as well as suggestions and assumptions regarding the directions for the further development of projects. <br><br>  <a href="http://2polyglot.com/ur/1781">Polyglot's</a> Marketplaces for Linguists and Their Clients was one of three that were tested on SCT # 3.  This startup was presented directly by its founder, the director of SVAM-Systems, Andrey Prudko, and the project‚Äôs PR manager Alexey Lemberg helped him answer audience questions.  This time the purpose of the presentation with the project presentation was to get a feedback from the audience, to hear different opinions about the idea itself and its business concept.  This is not the first experience of presenting your project and it is worth saying a few words about the organization, since  the result you expect from the presentation of your creation also depends on it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/beb/28e/7ec/beb28e7ec6c9497f9008a833e094b53a.jpg"><br><br>  It should be noted that during performances and further live communication, all without exception, the participants felt easy and at ease.  The impression was that you were sitting at home and chatting with your best friends, discussing in the process of communicating grandiose and interesting projects / ideas.  This effect was achieved due to the fact that the I coworking hub team is doing its job well.  Every detail thought out in advance.  Pre-held rehearsals for the speakers, adjusted to fill the presentation.  Conveniently organized space in which all elements are necessary and important.  And along with the fact that the atmosphere was created relaxed, everyone was helped to tune in to productive work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f8/085/995/4f80859958044651a73395073f2a6e36.jpg"><br><br>  Undoubtedly, performances at such events are useful for any projects.  For example, as a result of participation in the SCT, the Polyglot team received not only positive reviews, but also some constructive comments and suggestions for improving the resource.  In such discussions, you will always be helped to draw your attention to weak points (if any) that you could not even think about.  The assessment given by experts, colleagues or potential customers is important for the further successful operation of the project, so developers listen to the wishes and in accordance with them can decide to adjust their concept and directions for improving the startup. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292154/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292154/</a></p>
