Their first project, a game about combat furs, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shattered_Steel"><em>Shattered Steel</em></a> , was nearing the end of development, and the tiny studio wanted to try something new.  The founders of BioWare grew up on board role-playing games and their digital counterparts like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasteland_(video_game)"><em>Wasteland</em></a> , so they decided that the second game should be a computer RPG. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Given the industry trends of the time, this solution was unusual for a Western developer.  The <a href="https://www.gamerankings.com/">GameRankings</a> website dedicated to video game reviews registered at least one review for <a href="https://www.gamerankings.com/browse.html%3Fsite%3D%26amp%3Bcat%3D48%26amp%3Byear%3D1995%26amp%3Bnumrev%3D2%26amp%3Bsort%3D0%26amp%3Bletter%3D%26amp%3Bsearch%3D">27</a> RPGs released in 1995.  Of the 27 games, 21, including the top 13 by average, were created in Japan.  The top of the list was occupied by legendary Japanese developers: SquareSoft, Sega, Nintendo, Namco, Capcom.  Getting into this close company was difficult. <br><br>  ‚ÄúEveryone was convinced that the Western RPGs were dead,‚Äù says BioWare co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/TrentOster">Trent Oster</a> .  ‚ÄúAll that remains is a Japanese RPG.  No one in the Western world knew how to make an RPG, there was no hope. ‚Äù  And if the Western RPGs were dead, then the Western <em>computer</em> RPGs were twice as dead: all the 13 best RPGs of 1995 came out on consoles.

      Three years later, all these famous Japanese studios were still on <a href="https://www.gamerankings.com/browse.html%3Fsite%3D%26amp%3Bcat%3D48%26amp%3Byear%3D1998%26amp%3Bnumrev%3D2%26amp%3Bsort%3D0%26amp%3Bletter%3D%26amp%3Bsearch%3D">the best list</a> in 1998.  But in second place after the little-known game Sega <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2018/1/29/16940902/1998-video-games-panzer-dragoon-saga-missing-masterpiece"><em>Panzer Dragoon Saga,</em></a> they were joined by a new name: BioWare, the creators of <em>Baldur's Gate</em> . <br><br>  <em>Baldur's Gate</em> was the result of an exhausting and painstaking three-year work of a team of 15 people who had too little experience to realize the greatness of the task undertaken.  The game expanded the scope of the genre, created a new narrative, technical and gameplay foundation, and also laid the foundation for the uniqueness of one of the most famous studios over the past two decades.  ‚ÄúThis project has redefined the expectations of players about what should be the role-playing game.  I think he completely ‚Äúrestarted‚Äù the whole concept of the Western RPGs, ‚Äùsays Oster. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b53/ea9/f87/b53ea9f874cd9937e221703e1e1b7969.jpg"></div><br>  <em>Baldur's Gate</em> was born in the basement. <br><br>  Scott Greig, who became the first official employee of BioWare, recalls how he found out about the company: one intern who was involved in databases, spoke about his father's friends, doctors, who decided to move into the game-making industry.  ‚ÄúI thought, yes, just a couple of guys working in the basement,‚Äù says Greig.  And this, as it turned out after Scott‚Äôs meeting with the team at the end of 1995, he was right: Rei Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk, two of the three newly graduated doctors who (together with three other like-minded people) founded BioWare in February 1995, <em>really</em> worked in the basement of Zeschuka in Edmonton.  But their desire to create games was serious, and they were already working on one project.  ‚ÄúIt actually turned out to be two guys from the basement creating video games,‚Äù says Greig.  ‚ÄúBut these were two guys from the basement who had a serious contract with a real publisher.‚Äù <br><br>  The company was looking for a lead programmer.  ‚ÄúI was the only studio employee with a real game development experience,‚Äù says Oster, who, upon completion of <em>Shattered Steel,</em> became the head of the 3D graphics department in the <em>Baldur's Gate</em> development team.  "And because I created just one game ... I can not say that I knew exactly how everything should be done correctly." <br><br>  Greig did not create games other than his own amateur projects at school, but he had the skill of a programmer, so BioWare hired him.  When he began work in January 1996, the company had already rented a small office space above the restaurant.  BioWare no longer lived underground, but its scope did not increase much.  ‚ÄúI especially remember the fact that in the toilet I had to hold the door with my foot, because she didn‚Äôt want to close,‚Äù says Greig. <br><br>  Although <em>Shattered Steel has</em> not yet come out, BioWare wanted to create a model that could convince the publisher to invest in its <em>Battleground: Infinity</em> RPG project, which the company saw as an online game based on ancient myths.  The first month of work, Greig spent on collecting technical demo.  At that time, due to the limitations of computer memory, most of the game worlds consisted of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tile-based_video_game">tiles</a> .  ‚ÄúIf you look at the games of the <em>Ultima</em> series, or almost any other role-playing game of that time, then the artists painted tiles:‚Äú this is the corner of the room, here is a part of the wall ‚Äù- and they all fit into a uniform grid.  And the background was going to repeat all these pieces many times, ‚Äùsays Greig. <br><br>  Inexperienced BioWare artists didn‚Äôt learn the tile technique, so Greig experimented with the recently released Microsoft SDK called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX">DirectX</a> and found a way to import any full-screen background with scrolling drawn in Photoshop.  He contacted Muzyka, with whom he discussed teaching artists how to work with tiles, and showed him his alternative approach.  Greig told Muzyka that instead of connecting the tiles, "" We can just draw anything, while the background can scroll and characters will move on it. "He looked at me and asked:" How much CD is needed for this? "" <br><br>  Greig pulled out a calculator and estimated the required volume.  ‚ÄúI said,‚Äú Oh, well, probably not more than four or five. ‚Äù  And Rei answered: ‚ÄúWell, okay.  Let's do it. "  And this ten-minute conversation actually laid the technical foundation for what would turn into a <em>Baldur's Gate</em> as a result. ‚Äù <br><br>  The combination of new technology and lack of experience and skills led BioWare to move in a different direction, breaking down the limitations that were holding up previous games.  And this did not happen the last time.  ‚ÄúWe were open to ideas that everyone else didn‚Äôt even consider,‚Äù says Greig.  ‚ÄúAnd this demonstrates the power of really fresh ideas and lack of experience, because we didn‚Äôt know what could be done.  Therefore, they just took it and did it. ‚Äù <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nkJao67Drr4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The demo collected on the knee did not attract much attention, but attracted the interest of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feargus_Urquhart">Fergus Urquhart</a> , who had just created a team inside Interplay Productions to develop an RPG called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Isle_Studios">Black Isle Studios</a> .  This company was the publisher of <em>Shattered Steel</em> .  Interplay, which developed <em>Wasteland</em> , was one of the few western studios that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonekeep">published the RPG</a> in 1995 and recently licensed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSR_(company)">TSR, Inc.</a>  rights to use Dungeons &amp; Dragons.  When Urquhart heard about BioWare presenting the <em>Battleground: Infinity</em> , I realized that the studio's RPG roots and Interplay Lore would be a marriage made on <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mount_Celestia">Celestia Mountain</a> .  ‚ÄúThe description for the demo said that‚Äú this is something like D &amp; D, ‚Äùsays leading screenwriter for <em>Baldur's Gate,</em> Lukas Kristjanson.  ‚ÄúAnd Interplay just acquired the rights and said:‚Äú So why don't you <em>do</em> D &amp; D? ‚ÄùAnd all of our geeks were just stunned.‚Äù <br><br>  Ancient myths are in the past.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgotten_Realms">Forgotten Realms</a> , a popular fantasy entourage of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, came on the scene.  <em>Baldur's Gate has</em> now become a D &amp; D game.  BioWare could only create it. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f4/a93/d97/4f4a93d9739331dc7b7c0d9014d55563.jpg"></div><br>  <i>The BioWare team in the summer of 1997.</i> <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe ended up in uncharted territory,‚Äù says Greig.  The technical demo he created was only grain, which was supposed to grow into the <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/infinity-engine/3015-495/">Infinity Engine</a> , an engine with an isometric perspective and pre-rendered backgrounds.  He will later form the basis of <em>Baldur's Gate</em> , its extensions and sequels, as well as <em>Planescape: Torment</em> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icewind_Dale_(series)"><em>Icewind Dale</em></a> .  ‚ÄúFor the game engine, it was necessary to create such a huge infrastructure, because everything had to be done from scratch,‚Äù says Greig, adding, ‚ÄúIf we made an analogy with the movie, then we had to make the camera first, and then shoot the movie.‚Äù <br><br>  BioWare planned that <em>Baldur's Gate</em> would be a mix of old and new.  ‚ÄúIt was a kind of study of the old <em>Gold Box</em> games in terms of their depth and compliance with the D &amp; D rules,‚Äù said Oster, referring to the D &amp; D RPG <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Box">series</a> created by Strategic Simulations, Inc.  in the late 80s and early 90s.  "But we had to develop it by creating an interface that was almost similar to the style of real-time strategies." <br><br>  In the early RPGs, including the <em>Ultima</em> series, there was a complex management that made it difficult for the characters to choose and give orders at the same time.  But in 1994 and 1995, Blizzard Entertainment released <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft:_Orcs_%2526_Humans"><em>Warcraft</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_II:_Tides_of_Darkness"><em>Warcraft</em> <em>II</em></a> ;  These two games, along with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_%2526_Conquer"><em>Command &amp; Conquer</em></a> Westwood Studios series, were the initiators of the RTS boom of the mid-90s.  In these games, control is mainly carried out by the mouse, and not from the keyboard.  BioWare borrowed this concept by transplanting a new interface into a genre that desperately needed it.  ‚ÄúIn essence, we took the interface from the real-time strategy and inserted it into the role-playing game.  This solved the problem of the party mechanic, ‚Äùsays Greig. <br><br>  But this <em>did not</em> solve the second problem: mixing the control of five characters in real time with the complexity of the rules of D &amp; D made the gameplay chaotic.  ‚ÄúIt quickly became obvious that there was no way to use the full depth of D &amp; D in real time, without being able to even pause the game,‚Äù says Oster.  ‚ÄúAnd then we came to the system‚Äû games during a pause ‚Äú.  This addition allowed the players to stop in the middle of the game, give the party members a queue of teams, and run the game again in real time.  Although <em>Baldur's Gate</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turns,_rounds_and_time-keeping_systems_in_games">did not invent</a> such an approach with an ‚Äúactive pause‚Äù, it helped in its promotion.  ‚ÄúWhen we are playing <em>Fallout</em> with <a href="http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Vault-Tec_Assisted_Targeting_System">VATS today</a> to slow down aiming, it seems to me that its foundations were laid with the idea of‚Äú playing during a pause, ‚ÄùGreig said. <br><br>  Such mechanics made <em>Baldur's Gate</em> technically more advanced than previous RPGs, but BioWare needed to fill this skeleton with a plot and characters.  Lead designer James Olin remembered the story of his board games to create some of the player <em>‚Äôs</em> computer companions at <em>Baldur's Gate</em> , but the main part of the story was the task of Christianson - another newcomer to the industry who became the first full-time screenwriter at BioWare.  He was hired in October 1996 after a chance meeting with producer BioWare, who was a friend of his friend.  ‚ÄúI had an English degree and had no idea how to use it,‚Äù says Kristjanson. <br><br>  Soon he created much more than was expected of him, writing approximately 70 percent of the 800 thousand words of the game, including dialogues, manuscripts and magazines.  ‚ÄúThe volume was huge,‚Äù says Kristjanson.  The concepts of Olin‚Äôs characters gave him a foundation, but they have not yet fully formed.  For example, Kristjanson recalls that in the case of his beloved by the fans of the <a href="http://baldursgate.wikia.com/wiki/Minsc">Minsk</a> ranger, the description was only ‚ÄúThis guy has a head wound and a hamster.  Okay, so what am I to do about it? ‚Äù <br><br>  For the BioWare team, which had a long experience of board games, a huge amount of creative work was heightened by the fear of creating a world in which thousands of people would play.  Kristjanson recalls a conversation with <em>Baldur's Gate</em> programmer Mark Darra (now he is the executive producer of the BioWare <em>Dragon Age</em> series and the future online action-RPG <em>Anthem</em> ) about the difficulties that their friendly team faced.  ‚ÄúWe asked ourselves: how will this work in general?  And then they answered: well, in the Nastolka business happens like this, in D &amp; D - like this, and in my last played game it was like this.  We looked at each other and asked: my God, how do we figure it all out?  This is madness.  We are fans of this topic, but now we have to create it. ‚Äù <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bYoRmGHIxA4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  According to Christianson, the most important thing for the plot was to convey the feeling that the players were sitting at the kitchen table with a group of friends, and to transfer it to a computer game that they play alone.  ‚ÄúThe most important thing is the character.  We understood it right away.  The most fascinating thing about D &amp; D is the controlled chaos of the party, differences in personalities.  Not just a bunch of skills with which you fight monsters, but individuals who conflict or move with the plot, depending on what you choose to do and who you will entrust it to. ‚Äù <br><br>  The quality of the <em>Baldur's Gate</em> dialogues and the unique individuality of each of the 24 companions and hundreds of minor characters set the game apart from the patterned projects that mostly attracted not with conversations, but with fights.  The composition of non-game companions, many of which were well voiced, which was rare for that time, was very diverse.  Three of the five basic party members were women ( <a href="http://baldursgate.wikia.com/wiki/Dynaheir">one</a> voiced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Hale">Jennifer Hale</a> ), and some storylines touch sensitive topics;  for example, when the main character meets <a href="http://baldursgate.wikia.com/wiki/Viconia_DeVir">Viconya Devir</a> , she is persecuted because she is a dark-skinned elf <a href="http://baldursgate.wikia.com/wiki/Drow">drow</a> . <br><br>  Although the newly formed BioWare was not particularly diverse in composition, Kristianson, whose experience was based on desktop D &amp; D, rather than previous computer adaptations, sought to make companions a reflection of his companions in real life, which always contrasted with each other and both individuals and races and sexes.  ‚ÄúEach of them brought a note of strangeness and splendor to the desktop, and this required a wide range of characters.  Not all of them resembled me ... This is exactly what I wanted to reflect in the game, because the role-playing games are becoming so wonderful also because of this. " <br><br>  Oster believes that the enormous scale of <em>Baldur's Gate</em> was due to the experience of Greig with databases.  ‚ÄúMost other game developers first looked at them in terms of gameplay, and did not think about how to most effectively present the data and access it.  Therefore, we were able to work with huge amounts of resources. "  As predicted by Greig, <em>Baldur's Gate</em> took five drives.  According <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2016/8/25/16038806/video-game-length-playtimes-f7b8e38f949f">to player statistics</a> on the <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game.php%3Fid%3D808">How Long to Beat</a> website, the standard passage of the main story lasts 44.5 hours, and the ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù passage takes on average 106 hours.  As in the RPG-ideal of <em>Wasteland</em> Music, many story lines can be developed in different ways, making it possible to go through the game again.  Comparing BG with the typical games of that era, Oster says: "Its scale was simply amazing." <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9f0/aa1/f1a/9f0aa1f1a46392646183d18cbd4ebcda.jpg"></div><br>  Since <em>Baldur's Gate</em> was so large, and the BioWare team had a size that was usual for that time, but small by today's standards, the development was carried out in very close cooperation.  ‚ÄúWe did not say: so, this is my work, only I will be engaged in it.  In essence, everyone did what they needed to complete the work, and we received a lot of feedback from everyone ... Even the junior tester from the quality department had a greater influence on <em>Baldur's Gate</em> than the lead producer in any modern AAA game. ‚Äù  Even though Greig was a leading programmer and was not responsible for the plot, he still read all the Forgotten Realms books to immerse in their surroundings. <br><br>  Such an ethic of teamwork is partly connected with the enthusiasm of the team, and partly became a reflection of the fact that they were new to the industry and have not yet had time to burn out.  But it was also due to the fact that BioWare bit off much more than it could chew.  ‚ÄúWe used to say: we want to do this, will it be difficult?  But it turns out, making video games is pretty damn difficult, ‚Äùsays Greig.  So complicated that a more experienced team would probably have lowered the bar a bit.  ‚ÄúI think that the greatest advantage of our inexperience is that we did not know how difficult and voluminous the work will be,‚Äù said Oster.  "We underestimated everything so deeply that it seemed possible to us, although at that time and in that place it was almost impossible." <br><br>  The content volume of the heavy burden fell on the developers, who spent most of the last year of development spent in the crunch mode, and for the last six months they worked seven days a week for 10-12 hours, and sometimes they fell asleep right on the tables.  ‚ÄúWe worked, ate pizza, then worked again.  I swear, after the release of <em>Baldur's Gate,</em> I couldn‚Äôt even look at pizza for about a year and a half, ‚Äùsays Greig.  Although Oster claims, the whole team decided to work on such a schedule on their own, because they believed in <em>Baldur's Gate</em> and out of solidarity with their colleagues, such crunches <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2018/3/30/17179036/1998-video-games-starcraft-turns-20">were pretty standard</a> for the outstanding games of 1998.  They can be counterproductive and harm development.  Nevertheless, despite the fact that in many respects the development of games has taken a step forward, the crunches are still a reality of many modern <a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-rockstar-games-culture-of-crunch-1829936466">great games</a> . <br><br>  Having worked a lot of time (and having gone through several three-month postponement of the project), BioWare believed that it created a hit.  However, Interplay did not consider <em>Baldur's Gate</em> to sell well.  The previous D &amp; D games of this publisher have not become blockbusters, and <em>Baldur's Gate</em> and BioWare have not yet become a brand, so they did not plan to fully use the press.  ‚ÄúThey carried out standard marketing operations ‚Äî they bought a bunch of ads a couple of months before the game was released in various magazines like <em>PC Gamer</em> ... and that was the end of the story,‚Äù says Greig.  ‚ÄúWe put heart and soul into the project, and they told us: well, we have more interesting things to do.‚Äù <br><br>  Out of enthusiasm, rather than as part of a coordinated marketing strategy, BioWare team members themselves began to talk about the game, share news and answer questions on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">Usenet</a> and on D &amp; D bulletin boards.  By the time the game was released, BioWare's contagious, patient, and outspoken posts had aroused anticipation in the target market.  Greig recalls that one of the industry magazines predicted sales of <em>Baldur's Gate</em> within 100 thousand copies.  Even the members of BioWare themselves hoped for only 200 thousand, which would be enough to develop a sequel.  Then the game came out.  ‚ÄúIt began to sell fairly well, then it sold even better, and then sales skyrocketed,‚Äù says Oster.  "And mainly due to organic marketing - the players talked about playing with each other." <br><br>  A press release released on the game‚Äôs release day <a href="http:/rpgvaultarchive.ign.com/archive/19981220.shtml">reports</a> ‚Äúalmost madness‚Äù in ‚Äúseveral shopping centers‚Äù and cites many sources reporting fanatical presale activity.  <em>Baldur's Gate</em> remained a bestseller for two weeks after its release, having crossed the <a href="http:/interplay.com/press/bgno1.html">175,000 copies</a> mark during this time and confirmed BioWare's pre-release expectations.  By the end of February, it had reached <a href="http:/headline.gamespot.com/news/99_02/24_pc_interplay/index.html">500 thousand sales</a> , and by May 2001, the circulation had reached <a href="https:/www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131493/baldurs_gate_ii_the_anatomy_of_a_.php">one and a half million</a> .  ‚ÄúToday it is a completely standard procedure for any game.  The key part of marketing is the connection with the main audience, the creation of development diaries, and whole teams are involved in this work, ‚Äùsays Greig.  BioWare has unintentionally taught developers not only how to develop, but also how to sell games. <br><br>  <em>Baldur's Gate</em> received <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%2527s_Gate">many</a> Game of the Year and RPG of the Year titles, and its sequel from 2000, which used the improved Infinity Engine, was perceived by the critics <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%2527s_Gate_II:_Shadows_of_Amn">even warmer</a> .  " <em>Baldur's Gate II</em> was proof that we actually learned how to make games," says Oster. <br><br>  The <em>Baldur's Gate</em> development team continued its work.  ‚ÄúWhen I got involved in a company, my wife‚Äôs friend said:‚Äú Ha, a gaming company.  She will not last six months "," - says Kristjanson.  "Because gaming companies are constantly burning through."  Twenty-two years later, he still works at BioWare, where some of his younger colleagues, such as screenwriter for <em>Dragon Age</em> and <em>Mass Effect</em> Cheryl Chi, called <em>Baldur's Gate a</em> source of inspiration.  ‚ÄúShe constantly says that in childhood <em>BG I</em> and <em>BG II</em> passed six times, and for her it was an outlet.  I answer that this is very strange, ‚Äùsays Kristjanson. <br><br>  Although many of the pioneers of BioWare, including Greig and all the co-founders, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioWare">left the company</a> , its success over the past 20 years lies with that first, fundamental RPG.  " <em>Baldur's Gate</em> literally became the foundation for all subsequent BioWare games," says Oster.  ‚ÄúThat is, <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</em> , <em>Mass Effect</em> , <em>Jade Empire</em> , <em>Dragon Age</em> seems to have the same DNA.  If we discard all tinsel and high-quality graphics with cinematic dialogues, then we can find a lot in common. ‚Äù <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S84cnghuGso" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Oster is still not completely rid of the influence of the original game.  In 2009, he and another colleague from <em>Baldur's Gate,</em> Cameron Topher, founded the new studio <a href="https://www.beamdog.com/">Beamdog</a> , which now occupies the same office floor as BioWare during the creation of <em>Baldur's Gate</em> .  In 2012, Beamdog developed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%2527s_Gate:_Enhanced_Edition"><em>Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition</em></a> , a remake published by Atari (it now owns the <em>Baldur's Gate</em> license), which includes improvements, additions and enhanced support for mobile platforms.  But the remake began with the same code in order to preserve familiar sensations.  ‚ÄúWe rather acted as restorers, not as remakers,‚Äù says Oster.  "We did not want to change the concept of <em>Baldur's Gate</em> , but sought to create the best possible version of <em>Baldur's Gate</em> ."  For the <em>Enhanced Edition</em> , <a href="http://blog.beamdog.com/2018/08/updates-to-baldurs-gate-enhanced.html">patches are</a> still being released.  ‚ÄúI still see places that can be improved,‚Äù says Oster.  In 2016, his company released a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%2527s_Gate:_Siege_of_Dragonspear"><em>Siege of Dragonspear expansion</em></a> , which takes place between the events of <em>Baldur's Gate I</em> and <em>II</em> .  It became the first original game on <em>Baldur's Gate</em> over the past 15 years, with the exception of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%2527s_Gate:_Dark_Alliance">console spin-offs</a> .  <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/baldurs-gate-3-is-in-the-works-apparently/">There are rumors</a> about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%2527s_Gate_(series)"><em>Baldur's Gate III</em></a> , but Oster claims that Beamdog does not. <br><br>  In a sense, this sequel seems alien, because the fire of the original source continues to carry many sequels "in spirit": a series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillars_of_Eternity"><em>Pillars of Eternity</em></a> , a series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divinity:_Original_Sin"><em>Divinity: Original Sin</em></a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torment:_Tides_of_Numenera"><em>Torment: Tides of Numenera</em></a> 2017, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinder:_Kingmaker"><em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</em></a> 2018.  Money for all these games was collected by crowdfunding on Kickstarter, which faced an isometric boom - the developers use in their favor the infinite love of players for this type of games. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dG-4Gp3XNiw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  ‚ÄúSuccessful projects did not try to do a remake of what we did because we did not try to make <em>Baldur‚Äôs Gate</em> ourselves,‚Äù says Kristjanson.  ‚ÄúYou can reduce everything to‚Äú oh, it must be an authentic D &amp; D with numbers ‚Äù.  Even D &amp; D itself is not authentic D &amp; D.  Each group of players has their own invented rules, and these rules are invented because it is so interesting to play this particular group of eccentrics. ‚Äù <br><br>  When writing the script for <em>Baldur's Gate,</em> Kristjanson realized that in order to build peace, you need to ask questions and not answer them.  ‚ÄúEvery time you answer a question.  you need to put a couple more new ones, because otherwise the world is getting smaller, and not expanding. ‚Äù  Twenty years later, the world built at <em>Baldur's Gate is</em> still expanding.  ‚ÄúIf you're lucky, you take some of what inspired you, everything that you thought was wonderful, and build on this basis what seems valuable to people who build something on this basis,‚Äù says Greig.  "In fact, this is the best that any artist can do." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/434192/">https://habr.com/ru/post/434192/</a></p>
