      ‚ÄúVirtual Dating Assistant‚Äù is one of many new professions that are emerging in the digital age.  The appearance of such a profession 30 years ago was impossible not only to predict, it was impossible to <i>imagine</i> . <br><br>  Pessimists say that due to automation, soon 90% of people will remain unemployed and they will have to pay an AML.  Optimists say that the same predictions were at the previous stages of the industrial and technological revolution.  For example, when the most popular professions were "driver" and "telephonist".  The development of technology has led to the fact that millions of people were out of work.  However, this did not at all lead to unemployment, because there appeared completely new <i>mass</i> professions that could not be imagined before (for example, a courier in delivering goods or an employee of a taxi support service). <br><br>  Chloe talks in detail about her profession.  She says that professional writers and journalists, like herself, are often taken to help in online dating.  These professionals know how the word affects the reader.  This quality is the best for text flirting.  At the interview, she had to answer questions about ‚Äúethical flexibility‚Äù and readiness to work in the ‚Äúgray area of ‚Äã‚Äãmorality‚Äù.  But there is nothing special here - everyone who assessed people on the Internet only from their photographs is already familiar with objectification. <br><br>  When a client comes to such a firm, they make up an attractive resume based on the facts that the client tells about himself.  There is no special creativity.  Professional profiles use guaranteed phrases with proven enticing effect to attract the maximum number of users of the opposite sex.  The authors of the profiles work on manuals.  For example, if a client has a dog, then he opens the training manual on the ‚Äúdogs‚Äù page and selects one of the wits associated with the dogs. <br><br>  Then matchmakers come in and send open questions to the entire platform.  "Matchmakers" work on the filter of girls in accordance with the preferences of the client (age, interests, etc.).  In training manuals "matchmakers" there are many specialized issues (yoga, travel or downhill skiing, for example).  The purpose of sending open questions is to make contact. <br><br>  Finally, the "finalizers" come into play, who begin a personal flirt and bring the girl to the desired condition.  This work is the most difficult, creative and requires improvisation.  Therefore, trailers are trained for several weeks before being given access to client accounts.  At first, the mentor edits the employee's answers, explaining mistakes to him and helping with tips like not asking too many questions about work (for women such questions can be problematic) or reducing cognitive load - the girl cannot be forced to think a lot, otherwise she will run out of energy and enthusiasm.  Chloe was long trained on a more masculine style of communication: shorter sentences, fewer questions, fewer smilies, long pauses before answering, a date before the girl showed interest, and so on. <br><br>  The manuals for employees are written personally by the company's founder, Scott Valdez, a self-taught expert in the field of online dating, the author of the courses <a href="https://www.datingskillsreview.com/women-on-demand/">‚ÄúWomen on Demand‚Äù</a> and <a href="http://vkool.com/click-magnet-dating-system/">‚ÄúAutomatic Date Transfer‚Äù</a> .  He allegedly found out some hidden mechanisms in the work of the female brain.  These techniques and use the staff in practice.  For example, he explains how to represent a client as an alpha male who subconsciously attracts women. <br><br>  All this seems to be sexism and anti-scientific nonsense, but who is interested in scientific research, if the practical method gives the result.  Valdez says that especially effectively the worked technicians act on young girls who still have little experience of online dating. <br><br>  If in the future such services for dating sites will gain popularity, then at the flirting stage professionals can communicate on <i>both</i> sides, choosing the most suitable candidates for their clients.  In a sense, it is a return to the past, but at a more advanced technological level. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371471/">https://habr.com/ru/post/371471/</a></p>
