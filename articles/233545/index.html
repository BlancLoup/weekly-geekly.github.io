" <br>  For two days I installed and repaired prison telephones.  <i>K.Mitnik "Ghost in the network"</i> </blockquote>  A couple of days ago, I had the idea to instill in schoolchildren a taste for the beautiful and introduce them to <s>reading</s> writing articles on Habr√©. <br>  It is happening right now, I sit in a camp in the class of robotics (the camp is unusual, and with <s>blackjack and</s> courses on Olympiad programming, application development and robotics) and write these lines. <br>  Discussing the topics of information security, hacking Wi-Fi networks, 3d printers, Arduino, brute force and asymmetric encryption, it turned out that many (schoolchildren, schoolgirls, counselors and teachers) actively read Habr and use it as a reference tool for their projects. <br>  I came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãco-writing an article when, when discussing the most cool articles lately, the guys referred to an article where <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/232353/">‚Äúone acquaintance entered the Mitnick conference‚Äù</a> .  I had to admit that it was about <i>my</i> friend and, in the development of the topic of ethical hacking, I suggested that young people try their hand at writing interesting posts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5b7/2dd/276/5b72dd2768f6492ba8934be6c57ab5d3.jpg"><br><br>  The only time that all the camp participants could be found was lunch (they knew a lot at Hogwarts when making speeches), and I announced the recruitment of volunteers.  A few guys responded.  On the same day on the camp bulletin board for the maintenance of interest I hung ads.

      Goals: <br>  - incitement of interest to Habr, information security, social engineering; <br>  - show how what was previously considered unreal becomes real (the nearest growth zone); <br>  - inspire young authors to write articles on Habr√©; <br>  - to inspire / engage Habr's veterans to help beginning authors (Jedi-Padawans). <br><br>  For a smooth start, I decided to start with translations, then do some interviews with experts in the field (counselors / teachers), and then (already outside the camp) help the authors create self-contained content. <br><br>  Work plan: <br>  <i>the first stage</i> is the joint writing of an article on Habr, the translation of an <a href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2089344-1,00.html">article</a> from ‚ÄúTime‚Äù and the Mitnick video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DNn3O8XD1z0w">‚ÄúHow to Troll the FBI‚Äù</a> , as well as adding interesting moments from the book about the relationship between Mitnick and the FBI <br>  <i>the second stage</i> - each describes one event for the second part of the article "The history of hacker information system hacks" (the first part is the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/219091/">History of hacker information system hacks (1903-1971)</a> ) <br>  <i>the third stage</i> is the independent writing of my article under my supervision (approximate topics: " <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Code_Jam">Google Code Jam</a> .

It looked like I was a little crazy and rated my runaway status as a great video game.  Unfortunately, the consequences were real, but, psychologically, I liked to find myself in dangerous situations and then get out of them.  I do not know why I liked it, but I could not stop.  So I hacked a cellular provider in Los Angeles, serving FBI agent mobile phones that were chasing me, and I was able to track the location of the feds within Los Angeles and monitor all incoming and outgoing calls on their phones. </div></div><br>  On the basis of the location data I had and the analysis of (telephone) traffic, I tracked the movements of the feds.  If they came close to me, I could find out about it.  From the time when I happened to be in the role of a private detective, I had an early warning system installed, and on the way to work I received a signal from her that the FBI agents were in my apartment.  It was obvious that they did not come to arrest me.  The only logical explanation is to conduct a search for which they have not yet had a warrant. <br><br>  During the official search, agents would be required to make an inventory of the premises, so I cleared my apartment in advance of everything that might interest them, then I wrote ‚ÄúDonuts for the FBI‚Äù and on a large box of sweets from Winchell's Donuts (‚ÄúWinchell's Donuts‚Äù). put in the fridge.  So they could only find out what I have for them delicious donuts. <br><br>  They searched my apartment the next day, but found nothing.  I don‚Äôt know if they even looked into the fridge, but they don‚Äôt touch donuts.  I do not know why. <br><br><h4>  2. Ten Questions for Kevin Mitnik (New York Times) </h4><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Original</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> <a href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2089344-1,00.html">10 Questions for Kevin Mitnick</a> <br>  Could you hack into the Ghost in the Wires? <br><br>  Probably.  These are some of the most important companies in the world.  But I think it is likely.  Of course, I would only do it with authorization. <br><br>  Your first crime involved fake bus transfers.  Do you think you have had a different way? <br><br>  I think it goes back to my high school days.  The first 100 Fibonacci numbers.  Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students.  My teacher gave me an A. <br><br>  What was yours?  What were they? <br><br>  It is a social engineering policy to use, for example, to understand, e-mail.  This is a technique called a phishing, which is a person‚Äôs workstation.  It is extremely difficult to defend against. <br><br>  Has social networking changed hacking? <br><br>  Made it easier.  It is a great deal of effort to ensure that I can go beyond the network.  Then I‚Äôll be privileged access.  If I know you love, I can send you an e-mail from Angry Birds with a new pro version.  Once you download it, I could have access to everything on your phone. <br><br>  How easy is it for those tabloid reporters to hack into celebrities' phones? <br><br>  This kind of boggles my mind.  PIN for 1111 or 1234. It‚Äôs not like this. <br><br>  What is the perfect PIN then? <br><br>  It‚Äôs not like the old telephone number.  It‚Äôs easy to remember. <br><br>  What do you think of the Julian Assange and the WikiLeaks crowd? <br><br>  Bradley Manning  SIPRNet to CDs.  The government is the worst that I know of. <br><br>  Which of your hacks are you most proud of? <br><br>  I‚Äôm thinking of what I‚Äôve been hacking into and what I‚Äôm not really hacking for. <br><br>  You used Money's rankings.  Should the FBI monitor that list? <br><br>  No, it was my choice.  If I had my own choice, somebody might have figured it out. <br><br>  You served five years.  How do hackers get treated in prison? <br><br></div></div><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0f4/fc3/5eb/0f4fc35eba90c938baacf8905b6b18c1.jpg" alt="image" align="right"><br>  <i>Could you hack into the New York Times website and change the rating of your new book Ghost Online?</i> <br>  Maybe.  Large companies pay me good money for searching for vulnerabilities in their system.  I do not know if I can open the New York Times network, but, in principle, this does not seem to be something impossible. <br><br>  <i>Your hacking career began with fake bus tickets.</i>  <i>Do you think that if you were caught then your fate would change a lot?</i> <br>  I think it all started back in school.  Once, in an informatics class, we were given a puzzle where it was necessary to display the first 100 Fibonacci numbers on a computer screen.  Instead, I wrote a program that stole student passwords.  My teacher gave me a five. <br><br>  <i>What made you a good hacker?</i>  <i>Tell us more about social engineering techniques, which of them do you use?</i> <br>  Social engineering is the manipulation of people, the influence on them, in order to convince them to do something.  For example, click on the link in the email.  Most of the computer hacks that we know about use the targeted / targeted phishing technique (spear fishing), which allows them to seize key personal computers.  To protect against it is not easy. <br><br>  <i>How have social networks changed the hacking process?</i> <br>  They substantially simplified it.  I can go to LinkedIN, search for system administrators and voila: I have a whole list of phishing goals, because, as a rule, they have all the rights in the enterprise network.  Then I go to Twitter or Facebook, I ask them to do a few manipulations and that's it, I have full access.  If you like Angry Birds, then maybe I will send you information about the new version of the game.  Once you download it and I will have all access to your device. <br><br>  <i>How do yellow press reporters crack celebrity phones?</i> <br>  I think this is not hacking.  Many mobile operators set 1111 or 1234 as the default PIN for voice mail.  Agree, you do not need to be a hacker to pick up such a PIN. <br><br>  <i>What then is the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù PIN?</i> <br>  An ideal PIN is certainly not four characters long and should not be related to your past, for example, it should not be an old phone number.  This is something that only you and no one else should know. <br><br>  <i>What do you think of Julian Assandje and WikiLeaks?</i> <br>  I think most of the responsibility lies with Bradley Manning.  This is a soldier who could really declassify information from SIPRNet.  There were serious leaks in the US government, this is the little that I know. <br><br>  <i>What was your most amazing hacking?</i> <br>  I think when I monitored Pac Bell Cellular traffic to listen to the FBI agents who were hunting me at the time.  I stood on the edge of a knife, but always kept half a step ahead of the government. <br><br>  <i>You used Money.com's ranking of the most conducive cities to hide.</i>  <i>Did the FBI monitor this list?</i> <br>  Not.  I just used this list to randomize my choice.  If I made the choice on my own, someone could figure it out. <br><br>  <i>You got 5 years.</i>  <i>What is the attitude of hackers in prison?</i> <br>  Very bad.  A Colombian drug dealer offered me 5 million for breaking into the Prison Agency network to arrange his early release, to which I replied to him: "Let's discuss." <br><br><h4>  3. Mitnick and the FBI (based on materials from the book "Ghost in the network") </h4><br>  Mitnick annoyed the FBI so much that he was soldered to 460 years in prison and fined $ 300 million.  What else besides donuts did Mitnick do against the FBI? <br>  Below are a few lifehacks and examples of social engineering from Kevin Mitnick. <br><br>  In the course of his own investigation of who his ‚Äúnew friend‚Äù Eric Heinz is, Mitnick came across Mike Martinez's profile.  How to find out who this person is? <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Traffic analysis</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The process begins with the fact that you study the detailed call records (CDR) of the person whose phone number you identified, and learn from these records the necessary information.  Who does he call often?  Who is calling him?  Does it happen that he calls a certain person several times in a row at short intervals or, on the contrary, receives a series of such calls?  Are there people he calls mostly in the morning?  In the evenings?  Are there any numbers for which calls are particularly long?  Especially short?  And so on. <br>  Then you carry out a similar analysis of the people whom this person calls the most. <br>  Next, you ask the question: who do these people call? <br>  You are already starting to imagine the situation.  The amount of work was monstrous, this process should have taken a significant portion of free time, several hours a day.  I needed to find out.  There was no workaround: this is of paramount importance, regardless of the degree of risk. <br></div></div>  The security services themselves poured all personal data about themselves. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Reception of all data from the called state employees</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  I acquired control of all DMV (Vehicle Registration Service) phone numbers in Sacramento. <br><br>  From my computer, I checked whether the new number used for calls from law enforcement agencies, and found that the search group for this number had 20 lines, that is, when the number given to the cop was busy, the call was automatically redirected to the next available number out of 20 The switch was just looking for an unoccupied line. <br><br>  I decided to select the 18th number from the list for myself, since from the number near the end of the table I will receive calls only when the line is heavily loaded, otherwise I‚Äôll probably be bored with calls continuously.  I entered commands for the switch to add a call forwarding feature, and then redirect calls that go to this line so that they are redirected to my disguised cell phone instead. <br><br>  I think in those days I allowed myself exceptional arrogance.  I was called from the Secret Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the Office of Drug Enforcement and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Control. <br><br>  How about that: I took calls even from FBI agents ‚Äî guys who had the right to handcuff me and put me back in jail. <br><br>  Every time one of these guys called, believing that he was talking to a DMV employee, I asked for all the necessary login details: name, organization, requesting code, driver's license number, date of birth, etc. I‚Äôm not risked since none of them would ever have suggested that the guy on the other end of the wire actually does not work in the DMV. <br><br></div></div>  Kevin Mitnick built an early warning system that made an alarm signal if there were feds around. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Early warning system</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  In the RadioShack store, I bought a radio frequency scanner.  Through it, it was possible to listen to the cellular range (the Federal Communications Commission of the United States has already begun to put pressure on manufacturers of radio devices and to demand to exclude the possibility of interception of cellular communications).  I also bought a device called DDI, which meant ‚Äúdigital data interpreter‚Äù.  It was such a box that could decode information signals that were transmitted over the cellular network.  The signals from the listening device arrived at the DDI connected to my computer. <br><br>  The mobile phone is identified by the nearest cellular tower and communicates with it.  Therefore, when they dial you, the system knows which cell tower forwarded the call to the phone you are talking to.  Without such a mechanism, the cellular operator simply could not send a call coming to you.  I programmed my radio frequency scanner to the frequency of the cell tower closest to Telec, and could thus receive information from it.  So I found out which cell phone was associated with this tower, even when the subscriber was just passing through the coverage area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis tower. <br><br>  My scanner constantly sent a data stream to DDI, and the interpreter converted them into separate information fragments of the following form: <br><br>  618-1000 (213) Registration <br><br>  610-2902 (714) Search Call <br><br>  400-8172 (818) Search Call <br><br>  701-1223 (310) Registration <br><br>  Each such line shows the status of a cell phone in the coverage area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe tower being listened to.  The first group of numbers in a line is the mobile number.  A search call means that the tower received a call for a specific cell phone and signals that a connection must be established.  Registration indicates that a particular phone is in the coverage area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe tower, that it is ready to make or receive calls. <br><br>  I configured the DDI software package on my work computer so that it gives an alarm if DDI detects any of the programmed numbers.  I programmed into the program the phone numbers of all those FBI agents who, according to my data, were contacted by telephone with Eric.  The program constantly checked phone numbers, which, like a chain, went to the tower - to the scanner - to the interpreter - to the computer.  If in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãTeltec the cell phones of FBI agents had earned, my device would have warned me. <br><br>  I built a trap for the FBI and beat them a step ahead.  If they came for me, I would have known about it in advance. <br><br></div></div>  From time to time, Mitnick listened to the telephone company‚Äôs security manager‚Äôs conversations, and one day he heard a mention of his name. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Overheard conversation</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  I instantly alerted when one of them said: "Mitnick."  The conversation was fascinating, informative and encouraging.  It turned out that these guys had absolutely no idea how I was cracking down on all their systems and traps, and that made them nervous. <br>  They talked about the need for fresh ideas on how to trap me, talked about something that would give them clear evidence against me that they could bring the FBI.  They wondered what I could do next time to somehow prepare for this and eventually take me red-handed. <br>  Someone suggested a plan for catching me, which seemed completely idiotic to me.  I wanted to intervene in their conversation to the death and say: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it will work.  This Mitnick is smart enough.  You can never say exactly, but maybe he is listening to us right now! ‚Äù <br>  Yes, I happened to commit acts as arrogant and reckless as this, but this time I managed to resist the temptation. <br></div></div>  When Kevin was asked to ‚Äúspeed up‚Äù the release on bail of a friend, Kevin readily agreed: ‚ÄúNo problem.  Let me know when you pay.  One has only to pay a deposit, and I will pull him out in 15 minutes. ‚Äù <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Social engineering for parole</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Knowing how respectful people in rank belong to ranks, I simply called another prison in northern Los Angeles, Weyside, and asked: ‚ÄúWhat kind of lieutenant is on duty this afternoon?‚Äù They called his name to me.  Then I called the Central Male Prison, where Grant was held.  I already knew the internal number for direct dialing to the pledge department.  When the woman picked up the phone, I asked her for the extension number of the reception and release department.  For a person like me in such a situation it was useful that I myself had once passed through the prison system.  I said that I was the lieutenant of such-and-such (named the name I had learned before) in Weside.  ‚ÄúYou have a prisoner there, for which you must have already made a deposit.  He as an informant helps in one case.  I need him to leave immediately, ‚ÄùI told her the name of Grant. <br>  I heard a knock at the keys.  "We have just received an order, but have not yet entered it." <br>  Then I said that I wanted to talk to her sergeant.  When he went to the phone, I fed him the same fable and added: ‚ÄúSergeant, will you do me a favor?‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù he said.  - What you need?" <br>  ‚ÄúSince the person‚Äôs deposit has already been paid, could you personally oversee his procedures and release him as soon as possible?‚Äù <br>  He replied: "No problem, sir." <br>  After 20 minutes, Michael Grant called me and said that his father was free. <br></div></div>  Mitnick and Lewis used a scanner to track the activity of the FBI negotiations in their immediate vicinity. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Radio frequency scanner</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Lewis and I met in the parking lot about half an hour before the appointed time.  When I got into his car, he carefully listened to the radio wave scanner.  I could not ask what he was listening to: the scanner was programmed to track all frequencies used by the FBI, intelligence and counterintelligence, as well as bailiffs.  In addition, when the feds knew that they were dealing with someone who could understand their technologies, they often tricked and switched to the frequency of another agency, such as the Bureau of Prisons, the Anti-Drug Administration, and even the Postal Inspection.  Therefore, Lewis programmed tracking of these frequencies. <br>  The scanner did not pick up distant signals, but only those whose source was nearby, and those that were strong enough.  At that time, almost all federal law enforcement services were quite adept and encrypted their traffic.  However, we just had to check if they were saying somewhere nearby.  If the frequencies of law enforcement agencies began to buzz more than usual, we hastily retreated from this place. <br></div></div>  To detect activity on the air is half the battle, how to find out the content of the negotiations?  Mitnick elegantly solves this problem. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Bypassing the encrypted radio system</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  I armed myself with my faithful early warning system - amateur radio, which was slightly modified and allowed me to transmit and receive signals at all frequencies that were used by various federal agencies. <br>  I was terribly enraged that all the traffic of these organizations was encrypted.  Of course, I knew when one of these agents was nearby, but I had no idea at all, whether there was a conversation about me or about someone else. <br><br>  How can I crack the FBI cipher?  I thought a little and came up with a plan B. <br>  To enable agents to communicate over long distances, special repeaters were installed at elevated places, transmitting a signal from each other.  The two-way radio agents transmitted a signal at one frequency, and received it at another.  On the repeaters, the input frequency was set to receive agent messages, and the output frequency at which agents listened to messages.  Wanting to find out if there is a nearby agent, I simply monitored the signal strength at the repeater's input frequency. <br>  Such a system allowed me to play a little.  Hearing any noise that could mean messaging, I pressed the "Transfer" button.  My device started to generate a radio signal at the same frequency, and the agent signal was jammed with interference. <br>  In this case, one agent could not understand what the other was trying to transfer.  After two or three attempts, the agents were annoyed by this fussing with the walkie-talkie.  Very vividly imagined how one of them says: ‚ÄúSome kind of nonsense with a walkie-talkie.  Come on by normal communication. ‚Äù <br>  They switched the walkie-talkies from encrypted to normal mode - and I could hear two interlocutors!  Even today I find it funny to remember how easily this encryption bypassed and did not even crack any code. <br></div></div>  Even during the search and arrest, Mitnick didn‚Äôt cease to troll the security services officers: <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Arrest</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Half an hour later, at about half past one night, there was a knock at the door.  Not realizing how late it was, I automatically shouted: "Who is there?" <br>  "FBI". <br>  I am numb.  Once again knocked.  I cried out: ‚ÄúWho are you looking for?‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúKevin Mitnick.  Are you Kevin Mitnick? ‚Äù <br>  "Not!  - I said, trying to portray irritation.  ‚ÄúYou can check my inbox.‚Äù <br>  Silent.  I thought maybe they really sent someone to the mailboxes or decided that a sign with the inscription MITNIK would hang on the door of my apartment? <br>  Sucks!  I greatly underestimated the speed of the feds, they too quickly reached me.    .     ,      .   , ,   -   - . ?

He was both a hacker and a hacker catcher. <br><br>  <i>Second:</i> He did not harm (did not use stolen credit cards, did not publish the sources of the programs received, etc.).  His story with happy ending - going to a socially acceptable position.  (Plus Mitnick is out of politics, unlike Assange and Schwartz). <br><br>  <i>Third:</i> The range of topics covered in the book about Mitnick and other publications is very wide: telephony (wired and cellular), computers, programs and his fad - social engineering.  This allows us to talk about information security on numerous real-life examples, constantly maintaining the attention and interest of the young audience (this is a small stone in the garden of lecturer Natalia). <br><br>  <i>Fourth:</i> There are three books and one film in Russian for further study and inspiration to improve their skills.  Schneier is good, but academic and he has no ‚Äúadventure component‚Äù.  Poulsen has several books that seem to be excellent, but, alas, there are no translations into Russian (can he organize a translation?). <br><br>  <i>Fifth:</i> Mitnick - a cool guy and a pleasant companion.  He willingly responded to the invitation to talk with Hackspace members (I hope that in his next visit we can organize a meeting with schoolchildren / students). <br><br>  I invite the community to give feedback to novice authors and participate in the discussion of the educational process of information security (how to inspire young people to study the subject area, how to organize a boring process, what examples to teach, what books to read, how to explain <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/213241/">Torrent</a> , Tor and Bitcoin, etc.). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/233545/">https://habr.com/ru/post/233545/</a></p>
