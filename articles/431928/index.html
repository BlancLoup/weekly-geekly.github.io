Makarenko</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  The one who reads the title will probably think first, and what‚Äôs the point about Makarenko (who is too lazy to go to Wikipedia, this is the most famous <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE,_%25D0%2590%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD_%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D1%2591%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">Soviet teacher</a> in the world (!)).  I‚Äôm upset, I‚Äôll find out only by reading the article at least to the middle.  Such is the preface. <br>  I was forced to write this article by the fact that human hands tend to make micro oscillations.  In normal people, they are almost invisible (to other people), but on the quality of the photos this thing affects, no matter how cool.  And I am a photo amateur for everything :) And if for my comrade and assistant in traveling and mountain hiking <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentax_K200D">Pentax K200D</a> there is an excellent gift <a href="https://market.yandex.by/product--shtativ-velbon-cx-888/1001645%3Fslug%3Dshtativ-velbon-cx-888%26productId%3D1001645%26lr%3D0%26rtr%3D157">Velbon CX-888B</a> (which satisfies my needs by 200%), then for a lot of small soap cases and smart cameras there is practically a niche empty.  A DSLR with each day to carry no sense, no desire.  Therefore, it is logical that for a long time my creative thought was aimed at finding compact everyday tripods and mounts.  Plus, after the publication of the <a href="https://habr.com/post/425113/">Habra Post</a> about scanning books I was sent, to put it mildly, quite a lot of messages with questions about tripods and clamps.  It's time to "collect the stones" ... </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xv/xb/iz/xvxbizfmxjvdbe1amm2aiy-_xgm.jpeg"><a name="habracut"></a></p><br><h3>  About EDC and small Chinese tripods for smartphones </h3><br><p>  Now even there is such a fashionable concept as the industry of EDC-objects and things.  EDC (English. <i><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDC">Every day carry</a></i> - to wear every day) - a term meaning a set of items carried with them daily, which are used regularly, or which may be necessary in various non-standard and extreme situations. </p><br><p>  <s>Although, in all honesty, it can be said that all my childhood was spent surrounded by EDC things, like any kid who was born in the USSR in the pre-Internet era.</s>  <s>All kinds of miniature knives, flashlights, lighters, all kinds of functional key chains - thousands of them - were constantly exchanging, buying, upgrading ...</s> </p><br><p>  On the other hand, I very much doubt that someone in the event of an emergency disaster would suddenly need a tripod for taking pictures, but in the context of measured office work this issue is quite relevant.  So, all items and devices that fall under the definition of an EDC must meet at least a few of the characteristic features from the list below: </p><br><ul><li>  ease; </li><li>  compactness; </li><li>  significant shelf life; </li><li>  resistance to external influences; </li><li>  functionality. </li></ul><br><p>  Therefore, in most cases, when it comes to a mobile tripod, the main criteria for selection are its lightness / compactness and functionality, shelf life and stability fade into the background and, in theory, they are implied (or should be implied).  In addition, the issue of price also plays an important role (a tripod for a mobile phone is far from being a tripod for a DSLR camera and spending on a thing that you can easily lose / forget an amount comparable to the cost of the mobile phone itself, in my opinion, doing something completely meaningless and even harmful) .  Therefore, aliexpress comes to the rescue.  The Chinese industry offers a large number (the <a href="https://ru.aliexpress.com/item/Mini-Tripod-Professional-Aluminum-Flexible-Light-Tripe-Camera-Stand-Tripod-Monope-Para-Celular/32748183942.html">first one</a> , &lt;a href=" <a href="https://ru.aliexpress.com/item/YIXIANG-iPhone-huawei/32841775108.html%2522%2522%253E%25D0%25B2%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9">https://ru.aliexpress.com/item/YIXIANG-iPhone-huawei/32841775108.html"&gt;&gt; the second</a> </p>  , <a href="https://ru.aliexpress.com/item/Hot-New-Table-Mini-Portable-Plastic-Folding-Tripod-Stand-For-Camera-DV-Camcorder/32626059116.html">third</a> , <a href="https://ru.aliexpress.com/item/M-L-Medium-Large-Size-Camera-Tripods-Load-1-2G-3G-Gorillapod-Monopod-Flexible-Tripod-Mini/32818189955.html">fourth</a> ) monotonous model series (differing only in price and small cosmetic additions). <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wf/jm/qv/wfjmqvvbx9tjjnxnlddf6h90754.jpeg"></div><br><p>  All the models presented in the picture fit in with the cost up to $ 10 and more or less cope with their function (keeping the camera in the desired position without human intervention).  Standard screw connections are used to mount the camera.  By the way, one of the most popular Google queries associated with tripod technology is ‚Äú <i>what kind of thread is a tripod</i> .‚Äù  I think it is time to dot the <b>i</b> and once and for all and answer this question.  In the absolute majority of modern cameras, 1/4 inch carving is used.  Many old Soviet cameras (like "Zenith", "Kiev", "Vigilant") and medium format cameras and some modern overall video cameras use the so-called.  3/8 inch thick thread  Comparative characteristics of these threads are shown in the table below. </p><br><p>  Table - Comparative Characteristics of Inch Tripod Thread: </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ie/lm/ym/ielmymnh89ovn2kbbin25lbs6cc.jpeg"></div><br><p> Since both types of thread are widespread, it is easy to find adapters for almost every occasion in the open spaces of online stores (picture below).  In extreme cases, you can use the data from the table and order the required adapter from a familiar turner.  Especially this option is common among fans of panoramic shooting or astrophotographers.  Your humble servant is also a sinner, so he recently ordered himself a tap and a die for cutting 1/4 inch thread.  For those who, like me, like to make something on their own, and not wait for a month for a parcel from China - we are looking for on ebay for the request ‚Äú <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/1pcs-HSS-Right-Hand-Die-1-4-20UNC-Dies-Threading-1-4-20-UNC/232404844268%3Fhash%3Ditem361c687eec:g:8wgAAOSwlXhZZCM3:rk:3:pf:0">1 / 4-20 UNC Right Hand Die</a> ‚Äù in the case of dies and ‚Äú <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/1pcs-HSS-Right-Hand-Tap-1-4-20UNC-Taps-Threading-1-4-20UNC/323516297873%3Fhash%3Ditem4b5312f291:g:JYQAAOxydgZTKSEV:rk:3:pf:0">1 / 4-20 UNC Right Hand Tap</a> ‚Äùin the case of the tap. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3c/z6/ul/3cz6ul3bry6zvpyhyevjxe5l2fa.jpeg"></div><br><p>  If tripods are used with digital cameras, in most cases they are immediately ready for use; it is enough just to screw the camera onto the tripod screw.  In the case of a smartphone (or a GoPro camera, for example), you will need to additionally purchase a tripod head (see the picture below).  The heads also do not differ in their special design, they are about the same and provide a comparable degree of freedom of movement of the smartphone.  It is important that with an increase in the degrees of freedom the price of such a head increases very sharply.  Just the same as in the case of tripods for older sisters - SLR cameras. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qw/yo/ix/qwyoixybdlef4lpiexphbkyznhk.jpeg"></div><br><p>  It is clear that for maximum mobility (360 ¬∫) it is necessary to use a hinge joint.  Those.  ball head.  Here, the choice is quite small (given the budget).  Although in terms of convenience, the ball head provides maximum comfort for the user.  In the budget segment presents the same type of model, many of them are installed on the clamp. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9e/lw/xv/9elwxvm4pp7keazc2g4ecevh8ps.jpeg"></div><br><p>  Summing up, we can say the following.  In order to assemble a full-featured mobile tripod, we need at least two components - the tripod itself and the tripod head for it, if high mobility and the ability to fine-tune the position are needed - you cannot do without a tripod head and 1 / 4-1 adapters /four.  With a very big desire and ability to bargain with Chinese manufacturers and sellers, there is a rather high probability to invest in a previously announced limit of $ 10.  Of course, once in a while it is not necessary, sometimes an overpayment is obtained. </p><br><p>  With regard to the parameters mentioned at the beginning of the article for EDC equipment (a) lightness-compactness, b) considerable shelf life-resistance to external influences, c) functionality, we can say that if in terms of lightness-compactness, Chinese handicrafts still somehow try to match (after all, saving on materials, using light polymers instead of metal parts, simplifying the design, etc.), then in all the rest they are very far behind professional equipment (the same Manfrotto or Slik).  Yes, the reader will say, of course, the question of price.  And in principle, will be right. </p><br><p>  Right now we come to the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis article.  I have been interested in mobile photography for quite a long time, besides, I often have to <a href="https://habr.com/post/425113/">photograph</a> all kinds of books and documents.  During the time since the appearance of the opportunity to make purchases on aliexpress, I have accumulated a whole fleet of various mini-tripods, adapters, tripod heads, etc.  In their absolute majority, these are products of Chinese origin.  It seems that it is possible to use it, but every time there is uncertainty about whether this miracle will collapse if the screw is pinched, and if the weight of the chamber is formed, and if the thread is not cut, etc.  Therefore it is necessary to use it in the most sparing mode.  Because if a breakdown happens, you will have to wait another month until a replacement arrives. </p><br><h3>  About A.S.  Makarenko and his charges </h3><br><p>  More than 25 years have passed since the collapse of the USSR, and we have already managed to completely forget that someone can do interesting technical things, except for the ubiquitous Chinese.  Lost and, in general, resigned, learned to live with it.  Here I am, once again looking through the photo section of the accessories of the local flea market, I suddenly came across an unusual thing, which seemed to me a thing of my dreams and dreams about the perfect trip EDC tripod. </p><br><p>  A small lyrical digression.  Somehow it so happened that in all my articles I try to mention people undeservedly forgotten by my country, thanks to whose activities there appeared "something" which made me sit at the keyboard.  And now I would like to remember such a person.  Probably many of the generation that found the USSR heard about <a href="https://vm.ru/news/239360.html">Anton Semenovich Makarenko</a> . </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sx/xb/_q/sxxb_q3qa7y6j6_fi05kkwwy-x4.jpeg"></div><br><p>  A small part, perhaps, even read his book or watched the films ‚Äú <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DNYiR8Csbfog"><b>Pedagogical Poem</b></a> ‚Äù or ‚Äú <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D-qP4-uzSfB8"><b>Flags on the Towers</b></a> ‚Äù based on her motives.  Those who have not done this - I <u>highly</u> recommend.  If only because the UNESCO resolution in 1988 A. Makarenko attributed to the four teachers who determined the method of pedagogical thinking in the XX century.  The teacher realized (I specifically write with a capital letter) on the example of heavy adolescents and street children (this, by the way, is shown in the films), for which, with the support of M. Gorky, near the Ukrainian city of Poltava in 1920 was organized the Children's Commune.  F.E. Dzerzhinsky.  Adolescents were re-educated by means of labor in the small handicraft workshops they had created and equipped.  The children assembled and produced drilling machines and cameras, and moreover they did such high-quality things that already in 1927 a plant was created on the basis of the Children's Commune.  F.E. Dzerzhinsky, who went down in history under the abbreviation "FED".  The plant's main popularity was brought by FED cameras, which were exact copies of the legendary Leica II and Leika III.  But besides them, a huge number of different photographic accessories, including camera racks, were also produced.  This miracle was called unambiguously ‚Äú <u>universal pocket tripod</u> ‚Äù (see figure below) and was intended for installation of cameras ‚ÄúFED‚Äù, ‚ÄúVigilant‚Äù and other small-sized cameras.  For mounting in field conditions, there was a <u>panoramic head</u> with variable tilt angles and the ability to rotate 360¬∫, and also had a special screw-in device at the end of the tripod, for mounting into the bark of a tree, etc. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qy/vi/zl/qyvizlp4acaq6s9x-qogx1x0jw8.jpeg"></div><br><p>  Later, various modifications appeared, differing both in the structure of the supporting frame and in the functional features of the ball head (picture below). </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gm/sp/vq/gmspvqp5dbjpuqbetyfeel6af18.jpeg"></div><br><p>  The clamps and other enterprises of the domestic engineering industry were copied in their own way.  In particular, in 50-80 years.  XX century.  a functional analogue was produced (compatible with spare parts, but with a slightly different configuration of the ‚Äúcarrying frame‚Äù) under the ‚Äúbrand‚Äù of the <b>UTM LSNH</b> or <b>MTZiTM</b> . </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/79b/01f/cc7/79b01fcc70de8e0170cb77f2a1415fd8.jpg"></div><br><p>  I came across the first option, made in the factory to them.  I. Ye. Kotlyakov who existed as a pig iron foundry and mechanical workshop of the second guild of Nikita Grigorievich Petrov (and hereinafter the "Podkovno-gvozdilny plant") from 1882 and manufactured household iron castings and plumbing accessories, and in 1959 after merging with the plant "Red Metalist" became known as the "Order of the Red Banner of Labor, the plant named after I. Kotlyakov" UTM LSNH and produce unified series of tunnel and floor escalators, mining, crushing and grinding and laboratory equipment for  nonferrous metallurgy and consumer goods (for example, household hammers, dumbbells and <u>photo clamps</u> ). </p><br><p>  Despite the scattering of manufacturing plants, only one quality remained unchanged - ‚Äúreal metal-made for centuries‚Äù.  As I mentioned, I initially got a copy from UTM LSNH.  And the first impression of the devices was a delight.  Thing! </p><br><p>  Despite the fact that it was probably made more than 50 years ago, everything is remarkably functioning, spinning, clamping, holding. </p><br><p>  <u>Addition</u> from user <a href="https://habr.com/users/argentumbolo/" class="user_link">argentumbolo</a> regarding the mention of a tripod: </p><br><p>  - the book "Camera FED", D. Bunimovich, Art publishing house, Moscow / Leningrad, 1938 </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">description of tripod clamp FED 1938</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ck/fi/_f/ckfi_fzrfdptk-czyw2v61bc-yc.png"></div></div><br><p>  - the book ‚ÄúSmall Format Photography‚Äù, A. N. Vedenov, Lenizdat, 1959. </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">description of tripod clamp FED 1959</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m6/fg/gf/m6fggfamv-wno6cbcqhso4zup40.png"></div></div><br><p>  It should be noted that during the USSR, clamp supports were produced for a rather short time and cost a lot, about 3 rubles (with a salary of 100).  But this still allowed them to spread widely across the expanses of the USSR.  And now, with the availability of online auctions, all lovers of functional things have the opportunity to make a great gift for themselves (which, most likely, even children and grandchildren will be enough to use, if the standards for mounting photo equipment do not change).  Today, both on local flea markets, and on ebay open spaces (for keywords, ‚Äú <i>FED</i> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <i>vintage stand</i> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <i>USSR camera clamp tripod</i> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <i>ball head</i> ‚Äù) you can easily get yourself such an ‚Äúeternal‚Äù Soviet tripod-clamp for enough affordable price, comparable (or even less) with the cost of a set of Chinese tripod / tripod head / adapters with aliexpress.  But for this value, you gain joy, incomparable joy from the thing that is made with love, "a feast for the engineer," as one friend noted. </p><br><p>  I was so tired of disposable things that, having used a Soviet tripod for a day, I had an emotional desire to buy them for the future.  To get rid of bias, I decided to check the reaction of other people (mostly those who somehow faced the need to use tripods when photographing).  In the absolute majority of cases, the reaction looked something like this 1. ‚Äúwhat is it?‚Äù 2. ‚Äúhow / where did you find it ??!  3. ‚ÄúI want this myself !!!‚Äù.  The guesses were confirmed! </p><br><p>  By the way, something similar to foreign manufacturers of photo accessories still tried to produce.  The picture below shows such a clamp company "Hama".  Although to be honest, I could not find any references and references to this product.  Yes, and outwardly somehow I personally do not like ergonomics. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hb/o7/bl/hbo7bl1mzvgadvdqg2v9-6ywuqc.jpeg"></div><br><p>  Returning to the EDC-criteria mentioned at the beginning of the article, I will analyze the tripod clamp for compliance with the requirements for "everyday wear equipment".  According to the first parameter ‚Äúlightness-compactness‚Äù, the device has characteristics comparable to Chinese tripods, weight 185 g. But this is actually a solid piece of aluminum (there is no cavity inside to save resources, by the way).  By the parameter ‚Äúsignificant shelf life-resistance to external influences‚Äù - there is nothing to say at all, most of the tripods sold at flea markets, or have already celebrated the 50th anniversary, or are approaching this age.  Nothing to say.  And finally, the parameter "functionality."  Here, in principle, there is also nothing to flash, but unlike Chinese plastic toys, a clamp can be a) worn on a belt b) used as a <a href="https://www.takefoto.ru/articles/svoimi_rukami/1293_monopod_svoimi_rukami">monopod</a> (due to a drill screwed into a stump / plank / branch) c) used as a tactical pen ( again at the expense of the drill).  The tripod easily maintains the Canon PowerShot S2 IS not the lightest soap box (~ 450 g) and without noticeable differences my Pentax K200D (~ 730 g) The clamp leg, with a conical end, in the case of attachment to the bark of the tree, serves as an additional support for heavy equipment .  But how heavy - for me it remains a mystery, but offhand, a kilogram - this is not the limit. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yf/rz/75/yfrz75jhvi-906yvun02gyhoymm.jpeg"></div><br><p>  By the way, the "artist" with such a tripod will not be so easy to offend.  Not for nothing, I mentioned a tactical pen.  A tactical pen is one of the variants of the hidden self-defense weapon.  It looks like an ordinary writer (and she does write) a ball-point pen, but at the same time it is very large (but rather compact);  its body is made of steel, titanium or aviation aluminum.  This is a karate-type strike weapon, which is one of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D1%2583%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD">Yawary</a> or <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D1%2583%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD">Kubotan variants</a> .  Designed to strike at vulnerable points of the human body.  The picture below shows a tactical pen produced by the famous Israeli weapons company Uzi. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hz/ly/4r/hzly4ryvqmqswql7eb7ddoeac9w.jpeg"></div><br><p>  Many models of tactical pens have a reinforced tip on the end, which is used as a cullet, if you need to quickly get out of the car.  There may also be a nozzle with sharp teeth, on which a sample of its DNA is preserved upon impact into the body of an attacker.  Now compare with the 50-year-old Soviet photo accessories.  How can you not remember the words from the song ... </p><br><blockquote>  Everything that you learned, I have long forgotten, <br>  What you wanted to be, I have long been. </blockquote><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u8/am/gf/u8amgfsqrvwuw6bckcamadzzjoa.jpeg"></div><br><h3>  Detailed measurement / weighing / comparison with "China analog" </h3><br><p>  The description would be incomplete if I did not compare the mentioned clamps (at least those that I managed to acquire) with their Chinese descendants. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cn/aw/8n/cnaw8nab-m8bovqdv_v3l7txlyo.jpeg"></div><br><p>  Approximate dimensions can be estimated from the photo.  The clamp is fully collapsible, the thread on the tripod head and the stop with the drill end is the same - 3/8.  The bearing frame is made of duralumin and covered with eternal hammer enamel.  On the swivel head there are risks to simplify the panoramic shooting.  The clamp support weight is ~ 119.5 grams.  For brown "FED", the thread parameters are similar, the difference is in size, ball fixing method and shape.  KSAT, thanks to the fully collapsible mechanism, you can directly connect the drill with tripod head. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nf/j4/vb/nfj4vb3jiwhjw60zgfskl8bhjxo.jpeg"></div><br><p>  The instruction manual tells us the following: </p><br><blockquote>  A clamp with a swivel head allows you to install and secure a small-format camera at any angle relative to the vertical, to rotate the camera when shooting with a long shutter speed, and also allows you to carry out panoramic shooting. <br><br>  Connection thread size - 3/8 ‚Ä≥, 1/4 " <br>  The maximum angle of inclination of the rack-ball relative to the verified - 90 ¬∞ <br>  dividing price of the swivel head - 30 ¬∞ <br>  The case is covered with gray "hammer" enamel. </blockquote><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Paper instruction itself</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ro/z1/0e/roz10eycqbxxcgr-3akuanty3cu.jpeg"></div></div></div><br><p>  The second interesting find from the FED plant is a portable tripod.  Here is what the Soviet photo magazine writes to us, under the heading " <a href="https://doc.vintagetorg.com/foto/152-novinki-fototehniki-1972-god.html">New photographic equipment for 1972</a> ": </p><br><blockquote>  The new portable tripod is designed for low-format cameras FED, "Sharp", "Zenith", "Micron" when shooting in low light conditions, as well as when photographing with long exposures and self-timer.  You can also install an Etude projector on a tripod;  It is convenient to use it when microfilming from the table and from the ground, when shooting with long-focus lenses, when shooting a movie camera captions, etc. The tripod consists of a swivel head with a screw and a folding tripod located in the tripod housing.  The hinge head has a double-sided screw with 3/8 "and 1/4" threads, so the FED tripod is suitable for cameras with any tripod thread.  To change the thread, unscrew the clamping nut, turn the stand screw over and re-fasten it with the nut.  The hinge head can be used separately, for example, for more convenient installation of the camera on a standard tripod tripod.  The clamping screw of the tripod head securely holds the tripod screw in the set position and releases the hinge when rotated 90 ¬∞.  This year, the Kharkov Machine-Building Plant named after F. Dzerzhinsky will release 15 thousand photo prints.  Price 5 rubles. </blockquote><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cj/mz/he/cjmzheblkvgg48py2yva56ny_6a.jpeg"></div><br><p>  As a separate element, the portable tripod is certainly inferior to the clamp, but as an addition it certainly looks very good.  The thing is definitely high quality and durable.  I especially like the detachable mount of a tripod head, inside of which there is a 1/4-3 / 8 ‚Äúdad‚Äù - ‚Äúdad‚Äù adapter. </p><br><p>  I can not, by the way, not give as an example a unit for stereo shooting that is easily and simply assembled from tripods / clamps in a couple of minutes.  Unification is a big deal :) </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/21/hf/ml/21hfml14qor2-ouzjw6gvadfe1y.jpeg"><br><h3>  Conclusions: ‚Äúit is worth searching at auctions and purchasing!‚Äù (C) </h3><br><p>  Summing up, I‚Äôll finally say that my searches in terms of a portable tripod are over.  These devices are a real "joy for the engineer."  They are just nice to hold in their hands, not to mention the comfort of use.  Things are truly eternal.  So, dear readers, do not miss the moment - spend 5-10 minutes and a dozen or two rubles and get yourself these wonderful devices before they disappear from our flea markets (local avito and foreign ebay).  I am sure that they will please you with their faithful service for many long years. </p><br><p>  <u>And it‚Äôs not a fact that the Chinese machine builder will ever do what a Soviet street kid collected.</u>  <u>But something tells me that this thing will cost far not $ 10 ...</u> </p><br><p>  And by the way, if you polish aluminum - you get a great gift to a friend amateur photographer.  Tripod heads are remarkably compatible with each other, so it‚Äôs quite realistic to create a unique clamp stand for a specific user. </p><br><p>  <u>On this round, all good angles and good light!</u> </p><br><p>  <b>Sergey Besarab</b> ( <a href="https://www.facebook.com/steanlab">Siarhei V. Besarab</a> ) </p><br><p>  UPD1: the answer to "because the tree is deteriorating."  After the drill there remains such a hole.  IMHO so car exhausts cause incomparably more harm to wood ... </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vr/39/xf/vr39xf01exjpclluyzhu0nkolma.jpeg"><br><p>  UPD2: an interesting clarification led the user <a href="https://habr.com/users/zlovavan/" class="user_link">Zlovavan</a> .  A tripod of a similar type was used as an attachment (for a tree, for example) of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%259E%25D0%259D-50">MON-50</a> frag mine. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nz/aj/am/nzajamj9jzs-e-setcjgi-hspv8.jpeg"><br><p>  "used" with the comment <a href="https://habr.com/users/aapazhe/" class="user_link">aapazhe</a> </p><br><blockquote>  It looks ironic in a post about fatigue from disposable things. <br>  Few can come up with more disposable pieces than an anti-personnel mine. </blockquote><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Used sources</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><pre>  https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDC
