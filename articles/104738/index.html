However, no one officially announced the full list of services and functions of the state, which can be obtained through the Internet.  Having found <a href="http://docs.pravo.ru/document/view/4949055/4469108/">this</a> document, we understood the reason. <br><br>  The <a href="http://docs.pravo.ru/document/view/4954757/4475787/">plan</a> for the transition to electronic public services set a clear time frame for each stage.  Of course, our officials could not fail to miss such an opportunity and not delay in executing the order. <br><br>  We represent the TOP-5 ministries that did not have time to transfer their services to the Internet.

      <b>Fifth place.</b>  <b>Rostrud, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Ministry of Education and Science, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosreestr</b> <br><br>  Each ministry has one unfulfilled state service.  <i>Rostrud</i> back in December 2009 promised access to the forms of applications for obtaining information about the situation on the labor market in the Russian Federation, rights and guarantees in the field of employment and protection against unemployment. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  From March 2010, the <i>Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation</i> draws on the service of issuing invitations to enter the Russian Federation, as well as providing information on the decisions made on issuing visas to foreign citizens and stateless persons. <br><br>  <i>Rosreestr was</i> almost a <b>year</b> late in providing information contained in the Unified State Register of Real Estate Rights and Transactions. <br><br>  Since May 2010, the <i>Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation is</i> drawing on the formation and maintenance of a database of participants in the unified state exam.  There are no application templates for obtaining information on the results of the unified state exam, on applications submitted by persons entering higher and secondary specialized educational institutions, as well as for obtaining information on enrollment in higher and secondary specialized educational institutions.  And the delivery of the service via the Internet according to the plan will be realized only in May 2011. If, of course, the ministry is in time. <br><br>  <i>The Russian Interior Ministry</i> in December 2009 was supposed to provide access to applications for the admission of qualifying examinations and the issuance of driver's licenses.  The service itself should be provided via the Internet as early as September 2010, but as you understand ... <br><br>  <b>Fourth place.</b>  <b>Ministry of Culture of Russia and the Federal Migration Service of Russia</b> <br><br>  For <b>seven months, the</b> <i>Ministry of Culture of Russia</i> delayed with the provision of sample applications and with the electronic availability of such services as the provision of bibliographic information from state library funds and the provision of information from state library funds in the non-copyright part.  <i>The FMS of Russia,</i> in turn, is not in a hurry with issuing a residence permit to foreign citizens and stateless persons in the Russian Federation and with registration registration of citizens of the Russian Federation at the place of residence and place of residence within the Russian Federation. <br><br>  <b>Third place.</b>  <b>Ministry of Health of Russia and Roszdravnadzor</b> <br><br>  Until now, it is impossible to conduct licensing of pharmaceutical activities intended for medical use via the Internet (the plan indicates March 2010).  Registration of medical devices, as well as providing citizens and organizations with access to information about medical devices that have been registered under the plan, must be provided in electronic form from this September.  However, to get the service via the Internet is still not offered. <br><br>  <b>Second place.</b>  <b>The Ministry of Health and Social Development of Russia and the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation</b> <br><br>  Due to the slow pace of the Ministry of Health and Social Development and the Pension Fund, the population still does not have templates and samples for submitting and registering applications for the establishment of pensions in accordance with federal laws ‚Äú <a href="http://docs.pravo.ru/document/view/2175/4419238/">On labor pensions in the Russian Federation</a> ‚Äù and ‚Äú <a href="http://docs.pravo.ru/document/view/2180/3942431/">On state pension provision in the Russian Federation</a> ‚Äù.  Although the plan specifies March 2010. Also, from December they are drawing with forms for the insured to file applications for the selection of the investment portfolio (management company) and for submitting reports on the individual accounting of the insured. <br><br>  And finally ... <br><br>  <b>First place.</b>  <b>Ministry of Finance and the Federal Tax Service of Russia</b> <br><br>  The guys did not have time for <b>seven months</b> already in <b>six positions</b> .  Among them are services such as receiving a tax return on transport tax, accepting a tax return on corporate property tax and maintaining the Unified State Register of Legal Entities and Individual Entrepreneurs and providing the information contained therein. <br><br>  The most interesting thing is that there are no documents on the extension of the deadlines, on the postponement of dates, and even more so on the punishment for the delay in providing state services via the Internet. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/104738/">https://habr.com/ru/post/104738/</a></p>
