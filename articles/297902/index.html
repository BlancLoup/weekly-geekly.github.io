  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why Lenovo remains a successful company in a shrinking PC market</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hundreds of companies sold laptops, personal computers, tablets on DOS and then on Windows, but few of them existed for a long time.  If we talk about sales of PCs on Windows in corporate volumes, then the conversation boils down to three vendors - HP, Dell and Lenovo.  Lenovo's chief operating officer for North America, Emilio Gilardi, explained why the company is successful in such a complex environment. <br><br>  Gilardi primarily marks the complete product line ‚Äî from mobile devices to data centers.  He pays tribute to the management of the company, thanks to which Motorola was bought from Google and the server business from IBM in addition to buying a ThinkPad from her earlier.  This expansion of business allows Lenovo to turn directly to CIO and become an IT partner of companies, which ironically has been IBM's work for decades in the era of mainframes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/795/087/4ba/7950874baf1b30b195f1294818b87e4a.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  HP once concentrated on TouchPad products until WebOS finally missed the opportunity to become a market leader.  Now HP is working to increase its presence in the market of abundant gadgets, but still lags behind.  It was much more successful than Dell, which has created several innovative products, but is far from leading the data center market.  Without a doubt, Dell will be able to come up with something through collaboration with EMC.

      Gilardi also notes the fact that almost all of Lenovo‚Äôs competitors, except Apple, have cut R &amp; D expenses.  Lenovo can invest more in innovation, partly because the company is located in China, closer to the production itself than part of its competitors.  The effectiveness of such a system is <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/8246/">demonstrated by Xiaomi</a> .  While competitors are trying to use any features that give Microsoft with Windows and Intel, Lenovo chooses only those technologies that may be most valuable. <br><br>  It is easy to see that the company produces a lot of products.  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/268800/">She introduced</a> more than a dozen <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/268800/">ThinkPad devices only at CES 2016 in January</a> .  Samsung unsuccessfully sinned with a large number of smartphones, the profit of which fell by 49% in 2014 compared to 2013 after the release of 56 models in a year, so the Korean company <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/241714/">decided to release one-third fewer models in 2015</a> .  Gilardi hears accusations on this topic in the direction of Lenovo, but says that it is difficult to predict the success of a particular product - and let them be better than more than less. <br><br>  Now in the laptop and transformer market, Lenovo has a line of expensive ThinkPad gadgets from IBM, slightly more affordable Yoga and an average consumer-oriented Miix device.  Judging by the latest ThinkPad, problems with the maximum amount of RAM in 8 gigabytes are a thing of the past, now we have 16 gigabytes in the maximum configuration for most gadgets.  Most of the volume is mainly only in game notebooks. <br><br>  At IFA 2015 in Berlin, Lenovo showed a gaming line of powerful laptops with Intel processors of the latest generation.  There was also a large number of "full-scale" system officers and related devices.  So the company began to enter the gaming market. <br><br>  At the same time, Lenovo continues to work successfully with corporate clients.  This can be seen in Russia, shopping or visiting the offices of various companies - you will see Lenovo monitors and monoblocks in the offices of mobile operators, ThinkPad laptops in Decathlon. <br><br>  A couple of days ago, Megamind wrote about <a href="http://megamozg.ru/users/ivansychev/topics/">reducing the personal computer market in the world</a> .  The market has been declining for the fifth quarter in a row, and Apple shows growth only - and in this case we are talking about 2.8%, according to Gartner's estimates.  Lenovo lost in the 4th quarter of 2015 a reduction of 4.2%, but this is not more than the average relative to all vendors.  If we talk about the US market by the number of shipped gadgets Lenovo, by contrast, showed an increase of 21.1%, when HP fell by 8.4%.  So Lenovo occupied 6.9% of the US market in particular and 19.4% of the world market as a whole. <br><br>  Lenovo in terms of the company's strategy can be called "fast follower", where the key word is "fast."  HP tried to become a leader in the market for mobile devices with WebOS, but failed due to Android and Windows Phone.  In turn, Lenovo, in order not to reinvent the wheel, bought Motorola - a well-established ready-made business, and now sells 80 million devices a year, including thanks to the fame of the brand itself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297902/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297902/</a></p>
