    <hr><br><h2>  Chemistry / Physics / Nanomaterials </h2><br>  <b><a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/science/new_materials/news/6759/">A new coating for the protection of oil</a></b> and <b><a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/science/new_materials/news/6759/">gas pipelines</a></b> - a group of scientists from the ITMO University together with colleagues from KRONOS SPb developed a new material that protects oil and gas pipelines from corrosion.  The coating is more resistant to temperature changes and at the same time cheaper than imported counterparts.  The product enters the market this year. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://nplus1.ru/news/2017/06/13/renaturation">New method of "resurrection" of proteins</a></b> - scientists of the ITMO University and the Hebrew University in Jerusalem found a new method of restoring the activity of proteins (renaturation method suitable for a whole group of proteins) using positively charged nanoparticles.  The results of the work of scientists <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-01436-6">published</a> in the journal Scientific Reports. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://rg.ru/2017/05/25/kremnievye-chasticy-pomogut-lechit-onkologiiu.html">The technology of nanosurgical operations of cancer cells</a></b> - the scientists managed to improve the method of destroying cancer cells using nanoparticles.  In order to point out the cancerous cells, the particles are covered with a special compound that allows them to consolidate on the tumor, heats up with a laser and destroys the tumor.  Scientists have suggested using silicon nanoparticles for this and proved that they are extremely effective both as a heater and as a nano-thermometer. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/university_live/achievements/news/6794/">"Nonlinear tunable semiconductor and hybrid nanoantennas"</a></b> - the work of researchers of the department of nanophotonics and metamaterials of ITMO University, won the Alferov Foundation Award.  In a series of scientific papers, scientists described the principle of operation of an ultrafast optical modulator based on a single silicon nanoparticle created and controlled by femtosecond laser pulses, and proposed a conceptually new modulation principle.  In the future, such developments can be the basis for the creation of fully optical computers. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/science/new_materials/news/6993/">Full classification and comparison of different types of heterostructures</a></b> - scientists of ITMO University published <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smll.201702300/abstract%3Fwol1URL%3D/doi/10.1002/smll.201702300/abstract%26identityKey%3D2c45df16-6e62-46f0-803d-76839576a5f7">an article</a> in the journal Small, in which they proposed a classification and common terminology for describing various architectures of heterostructures based on cadmium chalcogenide nanoplates.  The material combines existing information on recent research in the field of nanoheterostructures. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://hightech.fm/2017/03/10/exciton-bit">Writing information in the form of a dark spot</a></b> - an international group of physicists led by scientists from the ITMO University was able to create excitons (quasi-particles, the transition state between an electron and a photon).  Unlike previous exciton devices, the new development is easier to implement.  In addition, scientists have proposed a method of recording data using excitons.  In the future, this will allow the creation of compact optoelectronic devices for fast recording and processing of optical signals. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/science/cyberphysics/news/6502/">Telescope on precision "legs"</a></b> - specialists of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Precision Electromechanical Systems of the ITMO University have developed precision electric drives for rotating a telescope that tracks the coordinates of orbital debris.  The lens must very accurately track the movement of an object located at a distance of thousands of kilometers, and rotate after its movement - this task was solved by the University team. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Food industry </h2><br>  <b><a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/startups_and_business/startup/news/6486/">Ice cream with a high content of protein</a></b> - ice cream, which helps build muscle, was developed at the Department of Applied Biotechnology at ITMO University.  The product does not contain sugar and its popular substitutes (fructose, sorbitol, xylitol), but remains sweet due to the natural low-calorie sweetener erythritol and has a high protein content.  In taste and structure, protein ice cream is as close as possible to ordinary ice cream.  According to the developers, it can diversify the diet of athletes. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/science/life_science/news/7055/">Edible protein films</a></b> - another development of the ITMO University - polymer coatings for food (vegetables and fruits), allowing to extend their shelf life.  Coatings are washed away with water and are edible (absorbed by the body).  The project received a gold medal at the contest of innovative biotechnological solutions at the international exhibition "Bioindustry". <br><br>  <b><a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/startups_and_business/startup/news/6348/">Functional cocktails</a></b> - a functional FOYT cocktail, capable of replacing one meal intake - developed by Artem Lepeshkin, a graduate of the Department of Applied Biotechnology at ITMO University.  Unlike analogs, the cocktail consists of natural ingredients and does not contain synthetic substitutes. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Photonics </h2><br>  <b><a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/science/photonics/news/7046/">Biocompatible photonic magnetic crystals</a></b> - employees of the international laboratory SCAMT of the ITMO University together with colleagues from LETI and the N.  Blokhin developed a new way to create magnetic photonic nanocrystals without the use of toxic substances.  Such crystals can be used not only in photonics, but also in biomedicine (for example, to combat thrombosis).  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-11673-4">The results of the</a> study, scientists published in the journal Scientific Reports. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/science/photonics/news/6601/">Express method for assessing impurities in transparent media</a></b> - optical scientists have created a new method for analyzing the distribution of microscopic particles in transparent media.  It helps to quickly find out the concentration of particles in the medium, find out how they are distributed and how transparent.  This rapid method allows, for example, in real time to determine the amount of solid particles in engine oil or to monitor the purity of lake and river water. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/science/photonics/news/6766/">Polymer holograms with ‚Äúrunaway‚Äù nanoparticles</a></b> are another development in the field of photonics and optics ‚Äî a new type of hologram recording based on a nanocomposite polymeric material.  The hologram is recorded when the components of the material redistribute under the action of radiation (nanoparticles in the material move during the polymerization).  The advantages of the new method allow you to create more reliable protection for documents. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/science/photonics/news/6980/">A new method of designing nano</a></b> - <b><a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/science/photonics/news/6980/">objects</a></b> - a group of researchers from the Laboratory "Modeling and Design of Nanostructures" of the ITMO University has developed general methods for calculating the linear and nonlinear properties of nanostructures of various forms.  Scientists have also proposed a new method for constructing nano-objects - in the future this may help create fundamentally new optical devices. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/science/photonics/news/6645/">The first in the CIS multisite quantum network</a></b> - scientists from ITMO University together with colleagues from Kazan Quantum Center KNRTU-KAI designed and launched a quantum network based on the existing fiber-optic communication lines of the operator Tattelecom (Kazan).  Now the nodes of the quantum network are connected to the main switching stations of Tattelecom on different banks of the Kazanka River, and the building of KNRTU-KAI.  In the future, the system will be developed in two directions: to improve the parameters of the quantum channel and connect information services to the system within the city infrastructure. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/science/photonics/news/6775/">A new chip for creating multidimensional entangled photons</a></b> ‚Äî an international team of scientists (including employees of ITMO University) took part in this study.  The researchers managed to create an optical chip capable of in-line generation and processing of entangled particles in more than several dimensions.  The technology is compatible with existing fiber optic networks and will simplify the development and distribution of quantum systems. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/science/photonics/news/6854/">Improved technique of lensless computed microscopy</a></b> - a joint development of ITMO University and the University of Technology Tampere allows you to get more information about the object when it is studied using techniques of lensless computational microscopy (for example, to record information not registered by the sensor between adjacent pixels).  And this, in turn, will improve the quality of laboratory and medical research conducted using lensless microscopes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/341356/">https://habr.com/ru/post/341356/</a></p>
