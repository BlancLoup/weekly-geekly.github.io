What reports are waiting for us?  If to sum up in one word, then ‚Äúvarious‚Äù.  HolyJS was never limited to the framework of the ‚Äúfront-end framework conference‚Äù, but sought to embrace the JS world in all its breadth.  And this time, the spread is very noticeable: from Node.js and GraphQL to browser-based ‚ÄúHeroes of Might and Magic‚Äù and victory over a quantum computer using WebAssembly.  As a result, when looking at the program, the eyes are so scattered that in this program it was not even possible to break it into several thematic blocks, and I just had to describe all the reports one by one. <br><br>  However, we singled out something separately: keyouts.  The conference will take place in three halls, but each day will begin and end with a general presentation for all, so it is logical to begin the description with these four themes from the four horsemen of the JavaScript apocalypse that will fly to Moscow from abroad. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Keynouts </h2><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eu/vn/6a/euvn6a5keen9tcnr01p2ng0h1yk.jpeg">  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/talks/gq7yrvvfgocsckyq68kok/"><b>Douglas Crockford - The Post JavaScript Apocalypse</b></a>

      When in the spring the legendary Douglas Crockford spoke at the St. Petersburg HolyJS <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DZMOdHCDoakY">with the theme ‚ÄúNumbers‚Äù</a> , he casually mentioned that new programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãshould appear: ‚Äúwe cannot leave JavaScript to our children, it would be terrible‚Äù.  And this time, opening the conference with a speech on the ‚Äúpost-Javascript script apocalypse‚Äù, he will cover the topic in more detail.  What should be the language that will eventually javascript?  And what should we do now while it is not yet? <br><br>  In addition to keyout, Douglas will make a ‚Äúregular‚Äù report on the second day of the conference - you can read about it below. <br><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/et/82/11/et8211jbrifwfliolz3oe4hcnfi.jpeg">  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/talks/1xsrhlexdq0u6koqscsgmc/"><b>Vitaly Friedman - New Adventures in Responsive Web Design</b></a> <br><br>  About Responsive Web Design speak far not the first year, but over time there are not less questions, but only more.  Browsers began to support HTTP / 2, Service Workers, Responsive Images, Flexbox, SVG, Font Loading API - how is it better to use all this now?  And if you started using what to do with legacy browsers? <br><br>  Such questions are right for Vitaly Friedman, co-founder of the famous <a href="https://smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a> website.  Firstly, this site has been covering such topics for years, and secondly, the site itself also has to solve such questions for itself.  In general, the lack of expertise here obviously will not.  And Vitaly, like Douglas, on the second day will present another report at the conference. <br><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k_/tk/sa/k_tksapphrtcvmz_p9x1pvw0gga.jpeg">  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/talks/60q1ywvrdqcwo8uk0o48as/"><b>Azat Mardan - You don't know Node</b></a> <br><br>  As you know, if someone uses JavaScript, this does not mean that he knows JavaScript.  This is evidenced by at least the popularity of the book ‚ÄúYou Don't Know JS‚Äù (she promises to really teach JS even to those who believed that they already know everything).  Azat Mardan states that the situation with Node.js is similar: many developers who deal with it do not quite know its capabilities.  And the keynout ‚ÄúYou don't know Node‚Äù is intended to fix this by showing five non-obvious features. <br><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/15/ij/it/15ijitsxtmyzvtwjtlqrwnlcafm.jpeg">  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/talks/j4ga7pmp68qiuagkyks2e/"><b>Lea Verou - / Reg (exp) {2} lained /: Demystifying Regular Expressions</b></a> <br><br>  Lia has already impressed many spectators with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DgweY3L0YA1Y">performance of the</a> spring St. Petersburg HolyJS, and now she will close the Moscow conference with another topic.  "Regular expressions" can seem something chewed a thousand times, and at the same time it is still not completely clear (and therefore frightening).  But Leah is able to explain and demonstrate everything with illustrative examples in such a way that it does not turn out to be either scary or boring.  And if you think that you already know about ‚Äúregulars‚Äù enough and you don‚Äôt need to hear about them again, then there will be a good opportunity to check whether you can really quickly select the right expression in your mind for some non-obvious cases. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  First Day Reports </h2><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fy/qg/1_/fyqg1_qywwxqrpnaiiypczkipu0.jpeg">  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/talks/2m8yli9bes6e2uaweymeqc/"><b>Nikolai Matvienko - Diagnostics of Node.js Applications Under the Hood</b></a> <br><br>  ‚ÄúUnobvious possibilities‚Äù of Node.js, which can be found in the keyout of Azat Mardan, is, of course, great.  But what to do if there is a problem with your Node.js application, and you don‚Äôt need to fix something new, but you need to quickly repair the existing one?  On Nikolay's report you will learn about the possibilities of diagnosing production-applications using debugging and tracing the application at different levels;  on how to track performance problems and memory leaks inside the Node.js application. <br><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jt/bk/f6/jtbkf6xxkq-3d87fnsrggjq8wyy.jpeg">  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/talks/9ym7oqodrqa0uuu0emsey/"><b>Denis Radin - We do it beautifully with pixel shaders and write our first</b></a> <br><br>  Whoever considers the work on the web "primitive form-slapping", this report can show how much it can differ (if, of course, such a person turns out to be at the JS conference).  The word ‚Äúshaders‚Äù is well known to gamers, but their use in UI components is unfairly bypassed, and Denis intends to correct this.  This report explores the experience of using GLSL (C-like OpenGL Shading Language) in developing web applications. <br><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t1/ak/5i/t1ak5izdjlasrct8bjhawvnyv5w.png">  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/talks/oy6iiwqaba0k4eucu8ccu/"><b>Egor Malkevich - (- We steal--) We extract data from the Internet</b></a> <br><br>  This report is a tour of the depths of the Internet in search of data.  Egor will tell you about the easiest ways to steal data from the site, as well as the most complex and highly obscure at first glance.  The report will be interesting to those who would like to make a useful application, but constantly postponed this task for later.  That's because getting data from the internet is great! <br><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pm/1t/yv/pm1tyvzjmzkd043eqikvejid8v8.jpeg">  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/talks/3hmyldgekuymaycqcykq60/"><b>Minko Gechev - Faster Angular applications</b></a> <br><br>  On the one hand, we all understand the importance of web applications opening and running as quickly as possible.  On the other hand, we are doing cumbersome single-page applications, where it is often required to load many resources at once, and then perform so many calculations in the main thread that the ‚Äúbrakes‚Äù are not surprising.  How to achieve rendering at 60 FPS and fast loading of the Angular application?  Minko is going to talk about both. <br><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rt/7k/qt/rt7kqt6fl_2z_wyfojdiwefzcbs.jpeg">  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/talks/2l5ryfgmyi4a6quayauski/"><b>Andrei Melikhov - How many frontenders do you need to write a mobile application?</b></a> <br><br>  For mobile developers, the mention of React Native usually causes a reaction ‚Äúfor the prototype it will do, but you cannot do a serious production application like this, you need to be native there‚Äù.  But what if to cross the native approach and separate screens on React Native?  And what if to entrust part of the work to the front-end?  In Yandex.Money they tried to do it - and Andrei Melikhov will tell you how this experience ended, what problems they faced and what results they achieved. <br><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7_/_b/xh/7__bxhrh2vzd-uqtd6oebn5ybji.jpeg">  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/talks/7b5mmgknzy6gkoikwgqk0i/"><b>Alexey Zolotykh - Architectural etudes: how not to ruin the architecture of your project</b></a> <br><br>  You started a huge project with a rollicating web interface and with Napoleonic plans for 2-3 years.  Chose a framework, set up a builder, download from GitHub, or generate a skeleton, the foundation of your future application.  You may even have a prototype.  And here the question arises, what to do next, because the mistakes in the early stages are the most painful.  It is very easy to break wood. <br><br>  During the report, Aleksey will take a standard and clear template project for everyone and try to build its further architecture, applying all the knowledge that he has accumulated over 10 years of work in the front end. <br><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ax/w6/st/axw6styz70yimgygule_vwhabfo.jpeg">  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/talks/67amybzm9qgug4qggg2uiy/"><b>Vitaly Slobodin - Headless browsers: what, how and why</b></a> <br><br>  When looking at the title of the report, many may think "why should I listen to it, I already know what headless browsers are."  And indeed, such browsers have long been entered into the lives of developers - with their help they test the code, check the quality and conformity of the layout, and not only.  But the problem is that the developers know little about how their tool works and works.  So the question ‚Äúhow‚Äù from the title is no less important - and many will be able to find an answer for themselves. <br><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wh/w0/z-/whw0z-gv2xkhmk1jrzpneaq9gg8.jpeg">  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/talks/txr1idzhteyggqcs0sae2/"><b>Vladimir Dashukevich - How to defeat a quantum computer using WebAssembly?</b></a> <br><br>  Today, we quietly enter our passwords and credit card numbers on TLS-protected pages.  This is largely due to the simple and reliable RSA protocol, which was proposed as early as the 1970s.  But this protocol can theoretically be hacked by a new type of computer - a quantum computer. <br><br>  Vladimir will tell you what a quantum computer is and how it can break the entire Internet, how modern browsers will try to prevent such problems, and how we can protect user data right now.  It will be about encryption algorithms such as SIDH, which can not be cracked at the moment by a quantum computer, and about their use in the browser using WASM. <br><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nd/vh/go/ndvhgoqr9r8mtr0u6g3kptqprg8.jpeg">  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/talks/ric1cxycdiu8wykc0wo4k/"><b>Alexey Bogachuk - Security: vulnerabilities of your application</b></a> <br><br>  Are the threats of XSS still relevant?  It has been about 20 years since Cross Site Scripting (XSS) appeared as a type of attack.  Since then, we have gained a wealth of experience and knowledge, the protection of our sites has become much more difficult, and numerous frameworks have been designed to protect us from mistakes.  But the latest data shows a completely different picture: in the first quarters of 2017, the number of reports of XSS attacks and the number of vulnerabilities found increased several times. <br><br>  Alexey will talk about why your applications are in danger, why frameworks don't save, how to find vulnerabilities and what tools to use for this. <br><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pd/rz/i_/pdrzi_hsvxtx2m0c566qzbljih8.jpeg">  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/talks/7j0e63zpfogwamqseecsy8/"><b>Mikhail Bashurov - Yarn, npm v5 or pnpm - who is cooler?</b></a> <br><br>  ‚ÄúTwo developers somehow got into one prison cell for ten years.  Came out one day.  Well, it was still an hour on the street to discuss which package manager was better and went away. ‚Äù  Jokes, but for all the endless debating of this topic, it does not become less pressing.  And Michael is going to compare instead of a simple holivar by specific indicators: speed, CLI, lockfiles and determinism. <br><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gk/g9/f6/gkg9f6_a7c8u9yaiqklufhevtoc.jpeg">  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/talks/1ttdztks9kmyqmwwowc6cc/"><b>Alexander Korotaev - Game "Heroes of Might and Magic" in the browser: long, difficult and unbearably interesting</b></a> <br><br>  The story of the formation of a programmer through the development of a "dream game".

Personal experience of the war with performance and the search for the right path, solutions to pressing problems and incredible discoveries in the world of JS. <br><br>  The report discusses useful case studies of the JS game developer: techniques for efficient data storage, drawing the UI on the Canvas, and ways to approach the parsing of binary files. <br><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eq/j8/ui/eqj8uiq2zoaehylhz1uigrgmvsc.jpeg">  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/talks/4ijfc6mkqcqweaiygiuae6/"><b>Mathias Buus Madsen - HyperDB - a scalable key-value store</b></a> <br><br>  Matthias is developing a new HyperDB P2P database in JavaScript, and will tell in detail about it to HolyJS.  Since the creator of the project will be talking, it is not surprising that the conversation will be detailed, deep and from different sides: both ‚Äúhow it works inside‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat you can do with it‚Äù.  Separately, ‚Äúdiscussion zones‚Äù can be useful here, where each HolyJS speaker will go after his report: if questions remain after the report, it will be possible to elicit all the details directly from the speaker. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Second day reports </h2><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eu/vn/6a/euvn6a5keen9tcnr01p2ng0h1yk.jpeg">  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/talks/6z1rnhj1toikmikgoqskyw/"><b>Douglas Crockford - Managing Asynchronicity with RQ</b></a> <br><br>  And again Douglas Crockford.  This time, not with a general discussion about the ‚Äúlanguage of the future‚Äù, but with a concrete response to the specific challenges of today.  RQ is a small <a href="http://www.rq.crockford.com/">JS-library</a> from Crockford, designed to help work with asynchrony in server applications.  According to Crockford himself, it is ‚Äúintended to facilitate use with the help of minimalism, and even more so with the help of minimalism.‚Äù <br><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ty/4u/6j/ty4u6jufsv1_4uxu_zd0qh0eybi.jpeg">  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/talks/2wi5gnywwacgkocakimuuq/"><b>Alexey Okhrimenko - Fatal lack of Node.js</b></a> <br><br>  And again Node.  The phrase "fatal flaw" has long been a part of the developers' lexicon, usually meaning "we didn‚Äôt do this technology, so let's do the same."  But Alexey believes that Node has not the fatal flaw that everyone thinks about these words, but another one.  And the report will not just tell you which one, but also try to correct this shortcoming. <br><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/in/xs/nu/inxsnuzoxd3tbvjwfhbsbo_9nds.jpeg">  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/talks/5urrpcyfbayw6es6ymyeqo/"><b>Alexey Taktarov - Animations in the world of states</b></a> <br><br>  We have already learned how to build clean interfaces and write ‚Äúundo-redo‚Äù in a few lines.  But what about animation?  They are often bypassed, and they do not always fit into the (state) DOM approach.  There are great solutions like React Motion, but what if you need to do complex animations or work with Canvas using the physics engine? <br><br>  Alexey will tell how he works with animations in React-applications, compares several approaches (D3, React-Motion, ‚Äúdirty components‚Äù) and will illustrate this with many interactive demos.  Also tells how he "launches" animations in Redux-applications.  The report is a part of the research, the purpose of which is to arrive at a pure and declarative way of defining animations in React-applications. <br><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3d/be/ah/3dbeahvncf1sjpckm7z43togy7k.jpeg">  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/talks/5hfhepewii0iesi46gmgou/"><b>Slobodan Stojanovic - Testing serverless applications</b></a> <br><br>  The word "serverless" now sounds very often.  But while many texts and reports on this topic dealt with superficial questions (‚Äúwhat is it at all‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat are the advantages‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy did they foolishly call the term, do you still have the server‚Äù), the pitfalls often remain underwater.  In real use, there are immediately questions that you don‚Äôt ask yourself at the first moment: for example, how does the serverless approach affect testing?  What is the main difference from testing traditional Node.js applications?  Slobodan intends to answer these questions and others. <br><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qx/m2/eh/qxm2ehyhvqz4ounsd72l5tvmosc.jpeg">  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/talks/6f57ymvefsmu0cweciwc4a/"><b>Martin Splitt - Better, faster, getting more from the web platform</b></a> <br><br>  At St. Petersburg's HolyJS, Martin analyzed the rendering performance from the bottom, starting with a single pixel.

But in practice, it often turns out to be very, very unsuccessful (the complexity and riskiness of an undertaking is always underestimated, and they overestimate themselves).  The Smashing Magazine website is well aware of this - but they decided on it anyway.  And now Vitali is ready to tell all about it: what decisions were made, mistakes were made, lessons were learned and dirty hacks were used.
