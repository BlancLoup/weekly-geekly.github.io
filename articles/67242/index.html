I am attracted to the software creation culture on this platform, BSD-based, decent automation capabilities, convenient software, as well as significantly fewer unnecessary and unnecessary pieces. <br><br>  Of course, before such a serious step as a platform change, I study the situation in detail.  I wrote out my tasks, picked up software analogues, including those for mobile use.  One of the tasks is to ensure the safety and security of information. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      I pay great attention to security issues.  Therefore, important information on my hard drive is encrypted, and I also make backups every day.  They are also encrypted.  If someone steals my laptop or external disk with backups, I can be calm about my passwords, correspondence, databases, accounts, customer access and other information that should not be distributed. <br><br>  Apple fans claim that all Apple software works fine.  Like, one supplier of hardware and software and all that. <br><br>  I'm not used to believing sectarian fans of the brand, they say, ‚Äúeverything at Apple is thought out and simple.‚Äù  As it turned out, for good reason. <br><br><h2>  How did you get Apple, or did you know that: </h2><br><br>  1. The backups created by the vaunted Time Machine are not encrypted?  Not at all.  Anyone can take your external drive, connect it to your computer and merge everything to yourself.  Fuck up, right? <br><br>  2. If you enable the FileVault encryption system built into MacOS (it is logical to assume that the system created by the OS developers will work more reliably and quickly, so it‚Äôs possible to choose it), then you will not be able to make backup copies with the same on MacOS with Time Machine. <br><br>  The system simply will not backup encrypted files if the user is logged in.  Backup will start only when you ... attention ... attach the disk and begin to log out!  In the process of logging out she backups. <br><br>  Fuck you can.  I can not imagine what the problem is to backup files when the user with access to them is in the system.  What an enchanting idiocy! <br><br>  Worse than only glossy screens (but here sober consumers of Apple products finally managed to break the resistance of sectarians, and they deigned to give a matte screen to a 15-inch MacBook Pro, at least as an option). <br><br>  3. But that's not all.  Praised Apple's convenience does not end there.  Having made the same backup copies of the encrypted home directory, you will not be able to use TimeMachine to view their contents. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3c6/eac/586/3c6eac586dfad6d0b82549b2f093db58.png"><br><br>  You can only restore everything at once.  Even if you only need one file.  To restore one file, you need to mount the image with Time Machine and use Finder. <br><br>  So here you are, vaunted, raspiarennoe, sliced ‚Äã‚Äãthrough and pushed back by the convenience of Apple products blindly-enthusiastic fans! <br><br>  But, to tear them through the knee, they made a visually destructive interface.  And, of course, did not forget to release the next debilovy video Mac vs PC, where Mac shows a bunch of clones.  Forgot only show hemorrhoids with the recovery of the encrypted directory backup. <br><br>  It seems that for the normal solution of everyday tasks arising from any user who stores any serious business information on his laptop, Apple's built-in MacOS solutions will not work. <br><br>  You will have to buy backups for an external screw with hardware encryption (preferably, otherwise you will have to bother with software encryption on your computer), and make backup copies with third-party software. <br><br>  After all, if the documents stored in the user's encrypted home folder are available after login to all programs, then they will be available to any backup software.  Oh yeah, not any.  Apple made a program that can not work normally.  Time Machine is called. <br><br>  For dessert: there is no normal backup control in Time Machine.  It is impossible, say, to exclude files by mask.  They are there, apparently in Cupertino, completely moved on the basis of thinking different.  Yes, and until recently, Time Machine stupidly did not see disks connected via USB to the AirPort in Apple! <br><br><h2>  What to do? </h2><br><br>  1. For backups, <a href="http://www.rocstor.com/products/rocbit-3b.html">an external disk with hardware encryption</a> , which is preferable, either creating a TrueCrypt partition and then mounting it each time, which already tired me a little under Windows.  It would seem to be a matter of three seconds, but annoying.  And I do not like to strain. <br><br>  2. The information on the laptop will be encrypted by the FileVault mechanism built into MacOS.  I still naively assume that it will work faster and more reliably.  I hope that Apple through the ass blinded only Time Machine, and FileVault works fine. <br><br>  3. Self backup - by third-party programs.  If I am logged in, all these programs will see my files in the encrypted home directory.  And, unlike the fucking Time Machine, I will be able to view the contents of backups and restore files one by one, as I described. <br><br><h3>  Another variant </h3><br><br>  If someone really likes Time Machine, instead of FileVault encryption, you can use, say, True Crypt or FDE software solutions from Checkpoint or PGP.  Mount the encrypted partition when logging in, and already have user files in it.  And then the <s>fucking</s> strange Time Machine will see and backup not the cutting from the sparse bundle, but the decrypted files, by the piece. <br><br><h2>  Perfect option </h2><br><br>  The ideal option would be to use transparent hardware encryption on external drives for backups and on internal drives.  There would be a special controller that would request a password when the computer starts up, even before the operating system starts.  And that this controller worked, without loading CPU.  And then neither FileVault nor TrueCrypt would be needed. <br><br>  So far, only one part of this system is available for Mac users: external drives with hardware encryption and biometric identification or USB token. <br><br>  For PC, there are solutions like Seagate Momentus FDE.  This is a hard disk with hardware AES encryption, in order to ‚Äúpassword-protect‚Äù it and ‚Äúunparry‚Äù, you need the computer's BIOS to support it.  But I did not find the information whether EFI on Macbook Pro supports correct work with such hard drives.  More likely no than yes.  Apple will stumble rather than meet the users.  They strangled twice before returning the matte screen to the 15-inch "proshkam." <br><br>  <b>By the way, no one knows if there are any changes in the upcoming release of Snow Leopard in this fucking Time Machine, except the possibility of copying the changed parts of the files?</b> <br><br>  And is it worth using FileVault?  Or choose another system? <br><br><h2>  Before minus ... </h2><br>  ... look in the mirror ;-) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/comment_images/9c4/f9c/063/9c4f9c0636fef2102b3f7bfbe228065c.gif"><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67242/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67242/</a></p>
