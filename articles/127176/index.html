  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Interview with Sergey Archipenkov - About the upcoming Software Project Management Conference</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>November 26, 2011 in St. Petersburg will host the International Conference in the field of project management " <a href="http://www.spmconf.ru/">Software Project Management Conference</a> " you are on its program committee, could you tell us in more detail - for whom it is intended, what will be discussed there?</b> <br><br>  AS: In my opinion, the conference will have a wide audience.  The conference should be of interest to everyone who, in one way or another, is associated with the management of software development.  First of all, these are managers: heads of companies, heads of personnel services, heads of functional departments and, of course, project managers and team leaders.  Well, of course, at the conference we are waiting for those who are still only going to become a leader. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>You have been participating in different conferences for a long time, where a visitor, where a speaker and already ‚Äúate a dog in them‚Äù :) Could you tell us what the upcoming conference should give you, how will it differ from other analogues?</b>

      <br>
      AS: This conference is one of the few that is entirely devoted to the problems of managing software development projects.  Observing the state of software engineering over the past decades, one can see that the industry has become an experimental kitchen, where experiments are being conducted on the use of many different recipes for managing software development projects.  What only methodologies did not invent and did not try to apply in the management of software projects!  These are Oracle CDM, IBM RUP, MSF from Microsoft, SEI TSP / PSP, and, naturally, :) numerous family of xDD methodologies, and xProgramming, and Scrum, and Lean, and Kanban, and many, many others.  What they just didn‚Äôt implement, and the statistics of successful projects from The Chaos Report from the Standish Group do not notice this.  I would like the conference to become a place for a deep understanding of the fundamental problems of management in software development, and a laboratory in which new effective ways to solve these problems would crystallize. <br><br>  <b>How do you think, why do people need to participate in the conference?</b>  <b>What most personally gave you participation in conferences?</b> <br><br>  AS: If you remember A. Maslow's pyramid, then in its upper part are the needs of self-realization, self-development and ownership.  The conference allows you to satisfy them all: participation - to communicate with colleagues, self-development - to learn from others, self-realization - to share their experiences.  Personally, I participate in conferences only for this reason. <br><br>  <b>How do you think - how should an IT professional choose an interesting and promising conference for himself, if he decided to take part in an industry conference?</b> <br><br>  AS: I think every professional (here I mean not those who get paid for the work, but those who attain mastery in the profession) should have a concept of personal development.  If to rephrase Seneca, then no conference will be useful to a specialist if he does not know to which pier he is going.  Therefore, we are waiting for the conference for those who seek to develop their skills in the field of software development management. <br><br>  <b>In SPMConf, one of the topics is the interaction of managers and hirelings, i.e.</b>  <b>PM and HR.</b>  <b>What are the main issues for discussion you see here?</b> <b><br></b>  <b>It is rumored that the conference will have a separate section ‚ÄúSay Tops‚Äù, where top managers of well-known IT companies will speak.</b>  <b>Already have information about who will be and what will act?</b>  <b>How did you get the idea to unite TOPs and conference visitors?</b>  <b>Tops is it interesting?</b> <br><br>  AS: I have only one answer to all these questions.  My experience shows that all these people have their own ideas about software development processes and everything related to them.  IMHO, a good illustration of this is the ‚Äúbattle of warlocks,‚Äù which unfolded on the Internet this spring.  Business owners, TOPs, HR managers, sales managers, software development managers, they all see the same objective problems from different angles.  And it's great!  This ensures that our shared vision is stereoscopic.  Therefore, one of the goals of the conference is to unite these points of view and get a three-dimensional, comprehensive picture of objective reality.  The more adequate our mental models of objective reality are, the more correct and effective decisions we will be able to apply. <br><br>  <b>Why is the conference city Peter?</b> <br><br>  AS: I think because St. Petersburg is my favorite city.  :) <br><br>  <i>Sergey Arkhipenkov, PMP PMI, expert in software development management, vice president of the Guild of Software Project Managers</i> <i><br></i>  <i>In software development for over 30 years.</i>  <i>Created simulation models of complex space systems in the Mission Control Center.</i>  <i>Managed commercial software development and organizational development projects at PriceWaterhouseCoopers, Luxoft, CBOSS.</i>  <i>He carried out projects commissioned by the European Space Agency, Daimler-Benz Aerospace, the Boeing Corporation, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, and Gazprom.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Author of 5 books, more than 100 articles, reports and training courses on information technology and software project management.</i>  <i>Permanent conference participant on software development issues.</i>  <i>Reports at the conferences of SEF-2009 (Minsk, Belarus), PM-Labs 2009 (Kiev, Ukraine), CEE-SECR 2009 (Moscow, Russia) were recognized as the best by participants' estimates.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127176/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127176/</a></p>
