  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is a honeypot and from what to protect virtual IP?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I would like to write a few words about what turns out to be such solutions for the protection of information that are still new to many Russian companies.  Either because of their lack of intelligence, or due to the fact that everything new in Russia appears later than in the rest of the world, but it is. <br><br>  Although it would seem that even this new can come up with in the field of information security?  The list of information security solutions and technologies, software and hardware, has long been known and understood by everyone.  But, as the Security Code shows, there are still technologies and software solutions based on them that are only gaining momentum in terms of use in Russian companies.  That is, ‚Äúunexplored zones‚Äù on the map of information protection technologies for Russian companies still remain. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Indeed: no company today has much time to explain why an antivirus or firewall is needed.  These are remedies that are purchased from year to year, always and by default.  Managers do not torture unhappy system administrators with orders to write a rationale for such purchases.  But often we are faced with a situation where the need to use information security tools is already there, and management, and IT and information security services, have not yet realized that this need should be met as soon as possible, otherwise information security incidents will occur and security risks will occur. and their consequences ... <br><br>  For example, in many companies that follow the fashion or ‚Äútrend‚Äù, they switched to <b>VMware virtualization</b> , they do not think at all that virtualization technology carries new specific information threats.  We will not talk a lot about them, for those who are interested in a complete list of these threats, we can recommend to get acquainted with the <a href="http://www.securitycode.ru/documents/virtual/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle2305%26utm_campaign%3Dhabrahabr">documents</a> on our website.

      Because of this ‚Äúnaivety‚Äù in assessing the risks of information security when switching to VMware virtualization, we often find surprise when we explain that it is <b>necessary to protect virtual infrastructures</b> .  And when it turns out that the ‚ÄúSecurity Code‚Äù has already developed a special software product for these purposes, and this product has even been certified by FSTEC, then there is practically no limit to the surprise of information security and IT specialists. <br><br>  Especially for companies that have not yet understood what information risks VMware virtualization carries, we created a video about our <a href="http://www.securitycode.ru/products/sn_vmware/vgate_com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle2305%26utm_campaign%3Dhabrahabr">vGate</a> software solution, which we invite all interested specialists to meet! <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ezn_k7nKdO0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgpK7uP6VuMAPpuKjuT29fHkmqO7Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Feedback about the product will be happy to accept.  As well as suggestions and wishes for his improvement. <br><br>  Another technology that has not yet gained widespread use in Russian companies is IDS technology based on sensory traps.  As the practice of communicating with Russian information security professionals shows, honeypot systems are new to them.  Meanwhile, the technology of <b>honeypot traps</b> has long been used in other countries.  Using it helps reduce the risks of unknown attacks and internal information leaks.  About this technology and also about the own development of the Security Code company - <a href="http://www.securitycode.ru/products/honeypot/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle2305%26utm_campaign%3Dhabrahabr">Security Studio Honeypot Manager</a> software product will be discussed in one of the free webinars, which will be conducted by a specialist of our company on May 31.  All interested professionals are invited to <a href="http://session.webinar.ru/HoneypotManager">register for the webinar</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119821/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119821/</a></p>
