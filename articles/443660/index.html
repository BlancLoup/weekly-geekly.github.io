Creaform's portable metrology 3D solutions are already changing the rules of the game in production, increasing the quality control and optimizing the technological process.  iQB Technologies is the exclusive distributor in Russia of such innovative products of the company as 3D-scanners HandySCAN 3D and Go! SCAN 3D, as well as MaxSHOT 3D photogrammetry. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In an exclusive interview with Creafrom representatives - regional manager Damien Plougastel and sales channel manager Marc-Antoine Schneider - we discussed why a modern enterprise needs 3D scanning, what trends will prevail in the coming years in the 3D market and how the role of the person in the <a href="http://blog.iqb-tech.ru/3d-printing-business-models-change">business model</a> will change Industry 4.0. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3f/w_/v2/3fw_v2minnmu2hdprthd4mx1o7q.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>Creaform is visiting iQB Technologies</i>

      <b>- What concept of Creaform would you call the most successful and why?</b> <br><br>  Marc-Antoine Schneider: Without a doubt, this <a href="http://blog.iqb-tech.ru/creaform-handyscan-3d-video">HandySCAN</a> is <a href="http://blog.iqb-tech.ru/creaform-handyscan-3d-video">Creafrom</a> ‚Äôs most successful product today.  This is the first 3D scanner developed by our company in 2005 and becoming a real breakthrough in the field of metrology.  He determined the success of the company as a whole and today remains the most innovative scanner on the market. <br><br>  Damien Plougastel: In addition, HandySCAN is our best-selling system. <br><br>  <b>- Do you have in your plans any new ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù product, like the 3D HandySCAN scanner?</b> <br><br>  P .: Not at the moment.  Of course, we are developing new devices, but the HandySCAN in its current form is an extremely competitive product, and there is no need to replace it. <br><br>  S.: It should be noted that every year Creafrom invests from 7 to 10 million dollars in research and development, we are the most innovative company in our industry.  We release a new product on average every two years.  In 2017, it was <a href="http://blog.iqb-tech.ru/creaform-maxshot-3d-video">MaxSHOT</a> , which, like HandySCAN, is distributed in Russia by iQB Technologies.  This year we are planning to upgrade the software.  And there is one interesting novelty, which you will learn about very soon. <br><br>  <b>- You gave the figures on investments Creafrom in production.</b>  <b>Can you share sales statistics?</b> <br><br>  S.: According to our estimates, Creafrom‚Äôs turnover in 2018 will be about 150 million euros, and the company's annual growth will have averaged 20% per year over the past five years. <br><br>  P .: The goal is to bring the turnover to 200 million by 2020, that is, we are developing very actively. <br><br>  <b>- How do you assess the development of the global market for 3D scanners?</b> <br><br>  S.: As such, we do not have published statistics, since this market is not studied in detail, it is quite a difficult task.  We turn to third-party services that conduct market assessments. <br><br>  P .: But we can definitely say that the market for metrology is growing: measurement capabilities are expanding, requirements and quality standards are becoming more stringent.  And besides, optical devices play an increasing role in metrology (namely, Creaform specializes in them), the non-contact method replaces physical measurements.  For us, this is a good trend. <br><br>  Sh .: I‚Äôll add that they are increasingly talking about Industry 4.0, and Creaform contributes to its approach thanks to its automated and robotic solutions - for example, 3D scanning with the help of <a href="http://blog.iqb-tech.ru/3d-scanner-handyscan-robotized-inspection">robotic manipulators</a> .  Such solutions meet the expectations of manufacturers.  Creaform plans to take a share of this new market of Industry 4.0, which has a huge potential: its turnover by 2020 is estimated at 3 billion euros. <br><br>  <b>- What other trends, in your opinion, will develop in the coming years in the 3D world?</b> <br><br>  P .: Further robotization of the industry, including in the field of quality control, will take place, and Creaform has very competitive solutions for this.  Any of our 3D scanners can be installed on robots to perform automated monitoring.  As we know, such a system was presented at the iQB Technologies stand at the Metalworking-2018 exhibition. <br><br>  S.: I think that all economic powers are interested in producing better quality goods - this is a global need.  And today, each manufacturer can stand out due to both the quality of its products and the ratio of price and quality.  For this reason, industries should pay much more attention to control issues, and Creaform offers solutions that are an important link in the production quality control chain.  In general, it can be stated that any industry has an interest in introducing 3D technologies to improve the quality control of its products. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k6/qw/w2/k6qww2f-fsvo3hfafxxo5mgv-ky.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>Automated quality control system at the Metalworking exhibition: HandySCAN 700 hand-held 3D scanner and Fanuc LR Mate 200iD robot arm</i> <br><br>  I want to say one more thing.  3D printing - an industry that is now on the rise and will evolve - has opened incredible prospects.  Creaform is one of the largest players in the 3D industry, and although we do not manufacture printers, 3D scan-based models can be printed on a 3D printer.  The real revolution will happen when 3D printers will be used as full-fledged production tools and the quality of printed products will need to be checked.  Industries will need solutions that Creaform offers to perform inspection of parts printed on 3D printers. <br><br>  <b>- In which industries are Creaform 3D scanners used the most?</b> <br><br>  P .: First, in the automotive industry.  This industry, which is often ahead of many others in terms of technology, is actively using innovations - including those offered by our company.  The largest global manufacturers today are the customers of Creaform.  Secondly, it is the aerospace industry.  In fact, Creaform products are indispensable in all industries related to the manufacture of transport equipment, because it requires particularly strict quality control of parts. <br><br>  <b>- Please tell us about some interesting project using Creaform 3D scanners.</b> <br><br>  P .: We were approached by the Swiss company Jet Aviations, which buys old aircraft and makes full re-modeling, for example, to create private jets.  Our company has completely digitized the huge Boeing 185 to completely recreate the interior.  The team worked on site, scanned and measured.  It was a colossal job that lasted several months. <br><br>  Sh.: Digitization took two weeks and still, it seems, it took two weeks to reconstruct the CAD file. <br><br>  <b>- Let's talk about Russia.</b>  <b>What do you think the specifics of the Russian market?</b> <br><br>  Sh.: Russia is a country with a growing economy.  When we developed a development plan until 2020, we analyzed the markets for investment.  And Russia, as one of the twenty largest world economic powers, is on this list.  We see the same industrial potential in Russia as in France, and France is the second market that Creaform entered after Canada, we know it well.  In France, we have been selling equipment there for several million euros since 2003 and are now there. <br><br>  <b>- But there are difficulties in the Russian market.</b>  <b>The problem of certification, for example.</b> <br><br>  P .: This is true, but this year we are certifying all the equipment for the <a href="http://blog.iqb-tech.ru/am-technologies-russian-experience">Russian market</a> . <br><br>  Sh .: Half of the product range has already been certified, and several recently released products remain <i>(the model range of HandySCAN 3D is entered in the state register of measuring instruments of the Russian Federation of metrological class - edition)</i> .  Indeed, this is an obstacle for foreign manufacturers.  With logistics in Russia, things are more complicated than in other countries.  To export goods to Russia, you need to take into account many formalities.  Let's not forget about the restrictions caused by international sanctions against Russia, which also create certain difficulties for us.  But despite this, we will continue to cooperate with your country.  Over the past year, we have increased our sales in Russia four times, and our Russian partner iQB Technologies plans to double Creaform sales this year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k0/1d/w5/k01dw555_f1i8sorbensnn3n9dg.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>Typical field of application for the HandySCAN 3D hand-held 3D scanner - automotive industry</i> <br><br>  I would add that many foreign companies work in Russia, such as Renault and Mercedes, which are very important clients of Creaform on a global scale.  In Russia, tremendous opportunities are opening up for us to attract these clients, since we already have experience of successful cooperation with them in other countries.  We see great potential here. <br><br>  <b>- In Russia, there is a certain skepticism among engineers, technicians who say that 3D scanners are very expensive and ineffective toys.</b>  <b>How could you dissuade them?</b> <br><br>  P .: The numbers speak for themselves: Creaform has sold about ten thousand 3D scanners worldwide today, and the annual sales rhythm remains at the level of 2-3 thousand.  There is a real demand, and as examples we can mention the largest enterprises - BMW, Mercedes, Airbus, Boeing, who trust Creaform, every year acquire new systems and implement them in production.  Here is the proof that this equipment is in demand. <br><br>  Sh .: I would answer these people that any investment requires an assessment of its payback.  Today, 3D scanners are available on the market at prices ranging from 25 thousand to 150 thousand euros.  When developing and manufacturing a product, it is necessary to take into account not only the cost of production, but also the cost of the production error.  Suppose a manufacturer has made a mold to create plastic parts.  If the form turns out to be defective, it will cost ten times as much as a 3D scanner.  Because the scanner will allow you to check the shape and avoid marriage before launching the parts into production. <br><br>  Thus, it is more profitable <a href="http://blog.iqb-tech.ru/3d-scanners-5-reasons-to-pay">to invest money in a 3D scanner</a> , which guarantees quality, and to exclude the cost of culling a large number of parts.  And I also think that from the point of view of sustainable development, which is now being talked about more and more, it is more profitable for enterprises to improve production quality, take care of the environment and better control the production process.  To quickly produce a quality product is more profitable for everyone - not only for their own business. <br><br>  <b>- Of course, many are deterred by large investments.</b>  <b>But also, perhaps, the conservative view of things also plays a role, hence skepticism.</b> <br><br>  Sh.: People are generally conservative in the mass.  When you are used to a particular method of work, you are hardly ready to switch to something new.  This is inherent in human nature - the desire to preserve what seems good and familiar.  Over the past fifty years, it has become obvious that technological innovations ‚Äî including the 3D industry ‚Äî have significantly improved people's lives and made them more convenient.  3D-technologies help to treat patients through the creation of prostheses and new devices, increase the safety of airplanes and cars - in general, their influence affects each of us. <br><br>  P.: Convincing skeptics of the benefits of 3D scanning helps and presentations that are conducted by Creaform.  We demonstrate technology with specific examples, convince people that this equipment can bring real benefits, and thus we have managed to sell ten thousand 3D scanners. <br><br>  <b>- How do you think the business models of enterprises using 3D technologies will change?</b> <br><br>  H .: As for Industry 4.0, it will change the very model of the plant‚Äôs operation and the role of man in production: special, dangerous, or routine tasks will be entrusted to specialized robots. <br><br>  Thus, in the industry of the future, a person will play a more advanced role, managing, installing and maintaining these robots.  This will contribute to the growth of the professional level and the self-realization of factory specialists.  And it is obvious that the 3D industry, as one of the driving forces of Industry 4.0, will make a significant contribution to a radical change in the production model - including through the development of automation and quality control processes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/443660/">https://habr.com/ru/post/443660/</a></p>
