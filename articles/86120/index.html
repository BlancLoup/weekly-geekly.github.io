The official press release quotes Steve himself: <br><br>  <i>We can sit and watch how competitors steal our patented inventions, or can do something about it.</i>  <i>We decided to take action.</i>  <i>We believe that market competition is healthy, but competitors should create their own unique technologies, and not steal our</i> <br><br>  Well, the statement in such an ultimatum can be considered as the recognition of HTC.  Steve and earlier allowed himself harsh statements, but given the fact that HTC has been developing communicators for many years, surely they will have a couple of hundreds of patents in the sleeve.  Also recall that the TouchFlo interface was introduced earlier than the first iPhone.
