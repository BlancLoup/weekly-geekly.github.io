      Layer-by-layer fusion of polymers was the subject of this report. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o6Y7ao-I-zc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3>  About technology </h3><br>  Legend has it that FDM technology was developed by Scott Crump, the founder of Stratasys. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w2/dd/29/w2dd29zqmqwmepdxxxylf68j_hy.jpeg"><br><br>  In 1989, a patent was filed, in 1992 the company received it, and before that, he experimented on his kitchen table with a glue gun on wax paper.  After seven prototypes, the first car was created. <br><br>  The RepRap enthusiast community changed the terminology somewhat, naming the FFF technology - Fusing Filament Fabrication, to bypass patent restrictions and develop the technology independently of Stratasys. <br><br>  The technology is widely known - the polymer, extruded in a heated form, stacks in layers and forms the product. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wg/k5/lh/wgk5lhtsmjhugc4snvqli-i2g3w.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  About printers </h3><br>  Designs are divided into two large groups - by the presence or absence of a thermostatic chamber - a closed body with adjustable temperature. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cc/kr/ua/cckruagbslwkmqh0xhh2qbihojk.jpeg"><br><br>  Kinematic systems more. <br><br>  <i>Cartesian and Delta</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vo/vn/-m/vovn-mqk8_1dxgn0_6wl-m0b5ui.jpeg"><br><br>  The most common - Cartesian, linear, where the movement of the extruder relative to the building platform occurs in three axes, for each of which is its own drive. <br><br>  The second most popular system - Delta - the movement of the print head in it occurs along three parallel guides, the change of coordinates along the Z axis occurs due to the change in the angle between the drives.  Workspace in printers with such a system, delta bots, is usually much more vertically.  They, too, are open and closed. <br><br>  <i>Polar and Scara</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/do/3i/fk/do3ifk6gg3fu7pjyqma9wmnlng4.jpeg"><br><br>  The kinetic system of the Polar type is a fairly new system represented by the company of the same name.  It differs from the Cartesian system in that the extruder, relative to the building platform, moves in the X and Y planes not linearly, but along a circle, like a sound-pickup needle moving along a plate. <br><br>  Skara is a kinetic system that came from robotics, intended for manipulators with limited mobility but with increased accuracy and rigidity.  In it, the extruder is located at the end of the manipulator moving due to the lever joints along the XY axes and a separate drive along the Z axis. <br><br>  The advantages of such systems are speed, lower noise level.  Disadvantages - more complex software, compared with the Cartesian. <br><br>  <i>Robotic Arms and 5-6 Axis</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tf/cr/u1/tfcru1kgx_rs8nydwqmjuq7tglq.jpeg"><br><br>  There are also 3D printing systems based on the use of full-fledged modern robotic manipulators.  They are used in the automotive industry, the creation of large structures. <br><br>  The five and six-axis systems are industrial machines with an increased number of degrees of freedom.  Turntables allow you to change the angle at which the tool interacts with the workpiece.  The tool here can be not only an extruder, but also a router, and a laser.  The revolving tool changer system allows both 3D printing and processing with other tools. <br><br><h3>  Restrictions </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pj/wk/j3/pjwkj3fcb2x8qrmutywnqg-kwg8.jpeg"><br><br>  Until recently, the materials and technologies by which extruders were made, did not allow to increase the printing temperature above 260-300 degrees Celsius.  This limited the amount of materials used. <br><br>  Most printers used a rather weak electronics, with low productivity and a small range of operating temperatures.  This led to failures, the inability to resume printing when the process was interrupted. <br><br>  The nozzles of ekutruderov, usually made of brass, because of wear did not allow for a long and stable work with composite materials. <br><br>  The lack of thermostatic cameras in most printers did not allow printing with high shrinkage polymers. <br><br>  Insufficient heating of the platforms and lack of vacuum tables caused problems with adhesion, holding the model on the platform during printing. <br><br><h3>  Basic polymers </h3><br>  Many new monopolymers and even more composites are now appearing on the market. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yc/4s/nl/yc4snlh2aftbwvxc8flmqsipgju.jpeg"><br><br>  The two most common base polymers are PLA and ABS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rv/kl/1z/rvkl1ziawsqlak9b6g5bsqjit7q.jpeg"><br><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/materiali/pla-plastik/">PLA</a> <br><br>  Polylactide, the easiest and most accessible material. <br>  A lot of positive properties - no shrinkage, which allows printing without heating, a lot of colors, safe - made from bio-raw materials, does not give toxic fumes and the smell of synthetics when printing. <br><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/materiali/abs-plastik/">ABS</a> <br><br>  ABS - shockproof plastic from petroleum products.  More toxic, gives significant shrinkage, which requires heating at least the platform, weak resistance to UV light.  Mechanically durable and heat resistant, moisture resistant and dielectric.  Very popular. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kz/vv/_7/kzvv_7ay8net7cgasnum4zpige0.jpeg"><br><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/search/%3Fsearch%3D%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582">PC</a> <br><br>  Polycarbonate - widely used as a substitute for glass.  Resistant to a wide range of temperatures, very durable, fireproof. <br><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/search/%3Fsearch%3DPET%2520%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA">PET</a> <br><br>  Polyethylene terephthalate is used in the food industry, in particular - in plastic bottles.  It has a number of interesting properties: transparent to ultraviolet, quite wear-resistant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ar/cv/za/arcvzaydmligvxelkayiyiyvkzc.jpeg"><br><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/search/%3Fsearch%3DTPU%2520%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA">TPU</a> <br><br>  Thermoplastic polyurethane is a flexible and abrasion resistant material, the properties of which depend largely on the additives used in it. <br><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/search/%3Fsearch%3DNylon%2520%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA">Nylon</a> <br><br>  Nylon is one of the most common plastics in the industry.  Can be used in moving parts, such as gears and bushings, due to the low coefficient of friction. <br><br><h3>  Support materials </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zv/wc/zq/zvwczqejjpiqxuagn9mstiy-kbs.jpeg"><br><br>  Support materials are used when you need to create supports in the process of printing on printers with two or more extruders. <br><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/materiali/materiali-hips/">Hips</a> <br><br>  HIPS - high-strength polystyrene, has excellent adhesion to ABS, dissolves with limonene.  ABS to limonene is absolutely stable. <br><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/search/%3Fsearch%3DPVA%2520%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA">PVA</a> <br><br>  Polyvinyl acetate is soluble in water.  Perfectly proved himself as a material of support when working with PLA, with which it adheres perfectly.  The only, probably, minus is quite expensive. <br><br><h3>  Superstructure materials </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nw/m_/1v/nwm_1vd-ua3jxfssgfytqrpikt4.jpeg"><br><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/search/%3Fsearch%3DPEEK%2520%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA">Peek</a> <br><br>  Polyetheretherketone is resistant to a wide range of temperatures, chemical and mechanical effects.  Keeps strength characteristics with simultaneous exposure to all these factors.  It is printed at a temperature above 400 degrees, parts from PEEK are capable of working for a short time up to 300 degrees, continuously for 260. Resistant to ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma radiation.  Chemically resistant to oils, fats, alcohols, ethers and other solvents. <br><br>  Exists in modifications with reinforcement with fiberglass, carbon fiber, ceramics.  There is a modification sertiitsirovannaya for medical purposes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bb/p2/hr/bbp2hrxtp1lozalbgz_s_wmfiae.jpeg"><br><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/search/%3Fsearch%3DPEI%2520%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA">PEI</a> <br><br>  Polyetherimide is a structural polymer with temperature stability up to 153 or 213 degrees Celsius, depending on the modification.  It has the same chemical resistance as PEEK. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h_/j4/_7/h_j4_7af66au4_xvxmxmnig58e4.jpeg"><br><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/search/%3Fsearch%3DPPSU">PPSU</a> <br><br>  Polyvinyl sulfone is the best thermoplastic for use in aggressive environments, alkalis, acids, gasoline.  Resistant to 189 degrees.  Mechanically durable.  Used in the manufacture of automotive parts, medicine, aerospace, tool manufacturing.  Withstands gamma sterilization and autoclaving. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ja/ws/s9/jawss91adyajyqrwww7ozaii-fm.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Construction materials </h3><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/materiali/apium-pvdf-1000-02kg-white.html">PVDF</a> <br><br>  Polyvinylidene fluoride is produced in Europe and in Russia.  It has high mechanical properties and chemical resistance.  Maintains temperatures to 140 degrees.  It is quite flexible, has a low coefficient of friction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xj/yh/r4/xjyhr4fi27gbgls0mj0d3rsgdxw.jpeg"><br><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/search/%3Fsearch%3DPOM">POM</a> <br><br>  Polyformaldehyde, it is also polyacetal.  Lowest friction coefficient.  Ideal for sleeves and gears in specified temperature ranges.  It works at temperatures from -50 to 100 degrees Celsius, short-term up to 140. Very high shrinkage, you can print only on printers with a thermally insulated camera and good heating. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ru/xp/kh/ruxpkhrxerp43guz6xppbryhooc.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Structural metal-filled composites </h3><br>  Structural metal-filled composites contain 80 percent or more of the metal.  The number of variations in the composition of a fine powdered metal that can be added to such a composite varies widely and affects the properties of the material.  Structural metal-filled composites, which give solid detail for practical use after baking, are mass-produced by Desktop Metal and the chemical concern BASF. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pw/es/bi/pwesbiigu1yal2yykbrpfidwrh0.jpeg"><br><br>  The BASF concern offers Ultrafuse 316LX on the basis of stainless steel.  The shrinkage of the material on the XY axes is about 19%, on Z - 21%.  This must be taken into account when preparing the model.  Requires vacuum sintering. <br><br>  Details turn out strong and full-featured, there is no problem of stratification. <br><br>  In the coming years, we are waiting for the explosive growth of the range of such materials. <br><br><h3>  Printers </h3><br>  <i>Stratasys Professional 3D Printers</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qr/hr/86/qrhr86xg0efltr0omilivvvymm4.jpeg"><br><br>  Fortus 380 / 450mc and 900mc are professional FDM printers from Stratasys. <br><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/stratasys-fortus-380mc.html">The 380th</a> camera has a 350x300x350 mm, the <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/stratasys-fortus-450mc.html">450th</a> has a 406x350 mm and the <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/stratasys-fortus-900mc.html">900th has a</a> 900x600 mm.  Stable work with basic and structural materials. <br><br>  <i><a href="http://top3dshop.ru/manufacturer-total-z.html">TOTAL Z</a> - Anyform</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7h/0z/ha/7h0zhanxnqvbvsghzdnuuot0iao.jpeg"><br><br>  A current example of import substitution is the entirely Russian production of printers, following the example of Stratasys products.  This is the only large-format printer in the Russian Federation for printing high-temperature plastics, equipped with a thermostatic chamber.  The frame, housing, camera and some other elements of these devices are made from domestic components.  In the <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/3d-printer-total-z-anyform-450-450-2x-pro.html">450</a> , <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/3d-printer-total-z-anyform-650-pro.html">650</a> , <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/3d-printer-total-z-anyform-900-900-2x-pro.html">900,</a> and <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/total-z-anyform-1200-pro.html">1200</a> model lines, the model's numeric index also indicates the size of the camera. <br><br>  The temperature of the camera of these printers, depending on the options ordered, is increased to 200 degrees, the printing temperature is up to 500, which allows printing on them with all the available engineering plastics. <br><br>  Available options: vacuum table, plastic preparation module, feed control and video control. <br><br>  <i><a href="http://top3dshop.ru/manufacturer-vshaper.html">VERASHAPE</a></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zm/io/7k/zmio7kdmubjyvmqdifsk8gcewl8.jpeg"><br><br>  Poland still can not go to space, but it can already in FDM-technology, and very well.  We saw live VSHAPER printers of the VERASHAPE series - excellent machines, high-quality and with good characteristics.  We have already planned training and certification of our engineers from the manufacturer. <br><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/personal/vshaper-450.html">450</a> , <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/vshaper-pro.html">PRO</a> and <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/vshaper-450-med.html">450 MED</a> are high-temperature models.  Medical modification is equipped with ultraviolet sterilization of each printed layer and HEPA-filter, which allows to use the device directly in hospitals. <br><br>  In the near future, we are waiting for the release of <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/vshaper-5-axis-machine.html">5Axis</a> - a <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/vshaper-5-axis-machine.html">VERASHAPE</a> five-axis 3D printer, the prototype of which we saw on Formnext in Frankfurt.  There is already a revolving tool-changing system, and a milling head will also be installed.  The turntable allows you to build a part of complex geometry without support, turning the part at any angle to the head.  It will save time and material.  One of the most promising developments. <br><br>  <i><a href="http://top3dshop.ru/3dgence-industry-f340.html">3DGENCE</a></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/td/6d/4u/td6d4uwim2bvjnn5zpxzopg1xda.jpeg"><br><br>  One of the biggest surprises is the 3DGENCE <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/3dgence-industry-f340.html">INDUSTRY F340</a> .  The previous model of the company was a small budget <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/3dgence-one.html">printer of</a> an open design, here we see a modern industrial design with a camera of more than 300 mm, modern control, heating.  Print heads with different heating temperatures, for working with different materials, are located in quick-detachable modules and are easily replaced, the printer can be bought with any of the modules or all at once.  The main advantage is a dvuhsopelnaya print head for high temperature, allowing you to print PEEK with support from another material.  Support from the PEEK itself is very poorly removed from the models, so this is an important point. <br><br>  The machine is assembled on modern industrial sites. <br><br>  <i><a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/omni3d-factory-2-0.html">OMNI3D</a></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0f/lz/ro/0flzrovqzuis3nbsa8ss9vudnau.jpeg"><br><br>  Polish <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/omni3d-factory-2-0.html">unit</a> , with a cubic print area with an edge of 500 mm.  A large unit, manufacturers of which also declared support for high-temperature materials. <br><br>  <i><a href="http://top3dshop.ru/manufacturer-massportal.html">MASS PORTAL</a></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3r/el/xf/3relxfubmwfaehpot7b2ooqnev0.jpeg"><br><br>  The line of cars from Latvia is large delta bots. A new line of <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/d400-dual-dryer.html">‚ÄúD‚Äù</a> devices has been <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/d400-dual-dryer.html">launched</a> , and printers of the <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/3d-printer-massportal-grand-pharaoh-xd-40.html">‚ÄúXD‚Äù</a> series are also being produced.  Digital-controlled automatic material <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/mass-portal-fd20.html">dryers have been</a> released along with printers.  In the top model there are two independent nozzles, for each of which you can set your own temperature for storage and operation. <br><br>  The company also released the <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/mass-portal-dynasty.html">Dynasty</a> system - a complete solution, which is completed on request by printers and dryers, has a special department for issuing ready-made prints and a box solution with an integrated manipulator that allows you to perform operations in automatic mode without opening the door. <br><br>  A high degree of automation, a set of nozzles with an output diameter of 0.2 mm and high print quality make Dynasty a unique product among FDM solutions. <br><br>  <i><a href="http://top3dshop.ru/manufacturer-roboze.html">ROBOZE</a></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vr/lx/3r/vrlx3rsy1cwsqv_zocu0ju10miq.jpeg"><br><br>  The uniqueness of the Italian high-temperature printers ROBOZE lies in the fact that instead of the belts they use helical gear.  This contributes to greater accuracy and reliability at elevated temperatures. <br><br>  The recently introduced <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/roboze-argo-500.html">ROBOZE Argo 500</a> prints at 550 degrees Celsius and has a cubic chamber with an edge of 500 mm. <br><br>  <i><a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/3d-printer-dt600.html">DYNAMICALTOOLS</a></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kz/lj/uu/kzljuub-o9dmd0xqghetu_p5dqa.jpeg"><br><br>  Spain.  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/3d-printer-dt600.html">DT600</a> has two independent print heads, both high-temperature.  You can print two independent parts at the same time.  Wi-Fi, plastic control, print recovery and darkness of other functions.  The company is actively developing, by the end of the year it is going to present a desktop SLS system. <br><br>  <i><a href="http://top3dshop.ru/manufacture-indmatec.html">APIUM</a></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mc/ui/k1/mcuik1dsafiq3jvvcyhyg0raqhy.jpeg"><br><br>  The German company Apium - the pioneer of high-temperature printing, it was they who released the first 3D printer that prints at temperatures above 400 degrees.  Now the company supplies the <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/apium-p220.html">P220</a> model, with a camera of 210x160x160 mm.  The price is comparable to printers from other manufacturers with a print area of ‚Äã‚Äãup to 500x500x500 mm, but this manufacturer is justified by extensive experience in the production of high temperature and heated cameras up to 300 degrees.  Provides the highest quality printing refractory constructional thermoplastics at a temperature of 550 degrees Celsius, of all those listed.

The printer is used to create prototypes of complex hydraulic systems in mobile fire extinguishing systems, saving up to 80% of time over 90% of finance at this stage of production. <br><br>  <i>Technical University of Kosice</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4y/of/oz/4yofozlxxkpypkwhkqv_3ps-lbk.jpeg"><br><br>  The Technical University of Kosice conducts neurosurgical and dental research.  They needed a universal tool for creating textbooks and medical constructions from PEEK.  The choice fell on the VShaper PRO MED, which completely satisfied the customer. <br><br>  <i>ARRINERA TECHNOLOGY SA</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i0/dv/ov/i0dvovarfgis0qyp62o81msuxjs.jpeg"><br><br>  A company that develops supercars - they create mirrors for their cars by printing them on a 3D printer.  The weight of rear-view mirrors has been reduced from 525 grams to 247. Printing a part takes 16 hours, in this case it is much faster than milling on a CNC machine.  Used ABS with HIPS as support, printer - OMNI3D. <br><br>  <i>Qbig</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kr/qu/md/krqumd8j3fnrmyzhcyzxaev6dlq.jpeg"><br><br>  Equipment developer.  In the development of metal parts used HIPS, as a material for printing burnable models for casting.  12 parts were received in 11 hours: 7 hours to print the parts, 4 hours to create a ceramic mold around the burning out template, plus casting.  The client is completely satisfied.  Significantly reduced time and cost of manufacture.  Printer - OMNI3D. <br><br>  <i>ROBOZE</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/in/5k/bh/in5kbhdb44zs9cdwsecsvo_qixk.jpeg"><br><br>  The metal part is replaced with carbonated CFR PEEK.  This is a carbon-filled polymer.  The table shows the advantage in cost and time of technology, compared with direct metal printing and milling. <br><br>  <i>MEYRA</i> <br><br>  Manufacturer of wheelchairs.

Saving money - 86% compared to the metal form. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kb/wf/a3/kbwfa3pjurfai5mqfpq5ilv2eye.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  What to expect from technology </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cm/nd/0y/cmnd0yhkpggwmilzbblvmfyhhks.jpeg"><br><br>  Manufacturers represent more and more conveyor and rack printing systems focused on mass production. <br><br>  Racking systems are systems with several printers combined into a single work network, where incoming orders are processed automatically. <br><br>  Conveyor system - a system where the function of the desktop is performed by a conveyor belt.  They allow not only to print several products without human intervention, replacing the working area with the advancement of the tape, but also to print products of increased length. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qf/p7/qu/qfp7quavzjpqf3x10ftvsxutt1c.jpeg"><br><br>  Multi-axis systems with automatic replacement of print heads and other tools promise greater savings in material and time due to printing from different angles and carrying out other operations, several different in one cycle.  Here the prospects are very broad. <br><br><h3>  Perspectives </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/06/kb/xq/06kbxq2nql-3wwfetn1myg8qlt0.jpeg"><br><br>  Extruder printing has broad perspectives.  In the construction field, 3D printing is just starting to spread. <br><br>  Printing with biological materials in medicine is a very promising area.  We cooperate with the Korean company RAKIT, which is a multifunctional system with the possibility of both classic FDM printing with special materials, and with a needle system for manipulating drugs. <br><br>  There are projects for printing glass and ceramics.  It is rather difficult to work with glass, but there are prospects and developments are underway. <br><br>  In the food industry, chocolate and other food products are printed, there are already successful application cases: in the photo are prints from Chocola3D purchased from us, from our client, Chocolama.  This area is actively developing.  We are also following the developments of MIT - high-speed FDM printers that print at a speed of 10-20 times the speed of existing 3D printers. <br><br><h3>  Fast decision </h3><br>  If you have <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/uslugi.html">tasks</a> for <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/3d-pechat-ob-ektov.html">3D printing</a> , we are always happy to complete orders for any of the technologies presented. <br><br>  You can buy <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/prof/">equipment</a> and <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/materiali/">materials</a> for independent production from us - we will help with the choice, we will select the best set for the start.
