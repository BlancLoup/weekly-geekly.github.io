    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Technical equipment implies an adjustment ‚Äúfor oneself‚Äù in order not to be distracted by various trifles in the process of rest.  This includes communications, entertainment and security.  These aspects I want to consider in today's article.  Recently I <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/277426/">wrote</a> that the camper was equipped with a powerful solar power station, so the issue of electricity has already been resolved.  The whole system was created similarly to an ordinary house, with the only difference that I was limited in space.  That is why many systems can be scaled to the whole house or left as is.  Perhaps someone will be useful experience in the construction / design of the house or the organization of a tent camp. <br><br>  <b>Mover</b> <br>  After you have reached the place, you need to park the camper and start preparing for the rest.  Parking with the help of a car is still fun, so all caravaners have an unspoken rule: ‚Äúwhen a new camper arrives, everyone gathers and goes to help push the camper manually.‚Äù  With a car, it is difficult to withstand accuracy of tens of centimeters, so often the trailer in the parking lot is placed manually by strong men.  Everything would be fine, but when there is a bump or a small bias, pushing a camper weighing 1.5 tons becomes very problematic.  This is where the mover comes to the rescue. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/61d/265/874/61d265874c304da8bd62b24257489085.jpg"><br><br>  These are two electric motors, which at the time of parking are pulled up to the wheels and rotate them.  There are motors from a 12V battery, which is installed in the camper.  Everything is controlled from the radio control, so you can be on either side of the camper.  The engine consumption is up to 120A, and the speed is 2 km / h.  Therefore it would be good to have a charged and capacious battery inside.  This is partly a toy, but a toy that makes life much easier.  But toys for men differ from boys' toys only by the price.  Such a mover costs up to 1,500 euros.  Expensive, but very convenient! <br><br>  <b>Security</b> <br>  You can talk a lot about safety in campers.  We decided to limit ourselves to two methods: blockers to standard locks and a good video camera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/096/450/a7b/096450a7b0b04695bd3e1e0d3f2e6e0a.JPG"><br><br>  Let's start with the castle.  In addition to the main locks there are locks that prevent the opening of the door.  It looks like this: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/PY4wFnJ1zdc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhsOvri8MdipyNDkqmDq11Na2U23g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  As for visual observation.  then we decided to take the <a href="http://hikvision.ru/products/ip/speeddome/DS-2DE5220I-AE/">HIKVISION DS-2DE5220I-AE</a> dome IP video camera.  The camera is good because it can shoot in any climatic conditions (-35..65 C) and in any light conditions, as it has an infrared light.  The manufacturer promises illumination at distances up to 150m, but such a task did not stand, and within a radius of 30 meters, visibility, as with a good, narrowly focused searchlight.  The camera can work both independently, according to a given algorithm (spinning or writing only on the motion to an inserted mcroSD card), and can work in a network.  The device firmware allows you to set up an alert in case of emergency by e-mail and reset the video \ photo to e-mail and FTP - this is in case the camera is also stolen.  In general, the topic of protecting any home, and even more so a mobile home, is very multifaceted, but let's return to the organization of work.  We connected the camera to our local network at the camper, ran it from a laptop, and all the video was written to a QNAP TAS-168 network drive.  It is worth noting that the camera can work with SMB, so you can share a folder on any computer, and the camera will write to it, logging under the necessary account is very convenient.  She writes a picture with a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels and a frequency of 25 frames per second.  Here is an example of how she takes sunset and sunrise. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dzuq_UOaVkk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjJzqS2rxs0-I8XzMhJRAXcfSNk1g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Internet and Local Area Network</b> <br>  It may sound strange, but it turned out that even on vacation you need a good and high-quality connection.  Someone shared photos through instant messengers, someone checked mail.  In the evening we watched clips and films in an improvised cinema on the river bank, and during the day there were working moments when good telephone communication was required.  Based on my experience, I decided to mount a <a href="https://zyxel.ru/keenetic-giga-3/">Zyxel Keenetic Giga III</a> router in a camper, and added the <a href="https://zyxel.ru/keenetic-plus-dect/">Keenetic Plus DECT</a> adapter to <a href="https://zyxel.ru/keenetic-plus-dect/">my kit</a> and picked up the first available <a href="https://zyxel.ru/keenetic-plus-dect/">handset of the</a> DECT standard.  The result was such a set: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f3/9ed/a47/6f39eda473544006b61392dfc1421e8e.JPG"><br><br>  The Yota modem was used as an Internet source, inserting it into a free USB slot.  The second slot occupied the DECT-adapter.  Two minutes of the router settings and now you can call from the usual Moscow number, being on the river bank, away from the capital.  By the way, when the DECT adapter was inserted, the router itself offered to install the required package, after which it remained to enter the settings of the SIP provider.  It is good that in the place of our parking there was a 4G network from Yota, but you can plug a modem into a 3G router and also distribute the Internet throughout the camp. <br>  It was experimentally found that the walls of the camper very well shielded the signal, so to improve communication with the Internet provider, it was decided to move the modem to the roof.  The two-meter USB extension cable solved the speed problem, and the whole company forgot about the mobile Internet and roaming! <br>  Ethernet was connected to the router: a network drive, an IP camera, an MAP Dominator inverter, and a laptop was periodically connected to download video and photos from cameras and cameras.  On the local network, the speed is gigabit and, when downloading video from cameras, they used a wired connection.  The Wi-Fi adapter works at 2.4 and 5 GHz, so if there are many wireless networks around, you can switch to a free frequency and work much faster. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c4/4d5/5e9/9c44d55e94664117b3a0be7da549bb05.JPG"><br><br>  Another feature of the router: since we still have an autonomous power station, sometimes every Watt of energy is counted.  A feature of the Zyxel Keenetic GigaIII router is the disabling of unused ports, which means lower power consumption and heat.  The latter was especially true because during the day the air conditioner worked almost without stopping for us - the camper heats up pretty quickly. <br><br>  <b>Network storage for camera and movie storage</b> <br>  When I went to rest, I understood that every second person would take a camera, I would take a camera, there would be a quadcopter and a security camera that writes around the clock.  I wanted to collect all the data in one place.  I have to say, in total, we shot more than 100 Gigabytes. <br>  Since I have had experience with QNAP appliances for quite some time, I trust their quality.  In addition, I like the convenience of the firmware and the whole process of user-tech interaction.  Therefore, I quickly decided on the requirements: you need a single-disk network drive with good performance and the possibility of a multimedia player.  The latter was especially true because I wanted to arrange a cinema in nature.  Such a drive was found and here it is - <a href="http://qnap.ru/dev/android-nas/ru/">QNAP TAS-168</a> .  By the way, there is a two-disk version of this NAS, but the doubled amount of data so far is unnecessary. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f42/232/654/f422326540194c56be8d8593290f8590.jpeg"><br><br>  The remote control is really included in the delivery package, and we need it for this: the NAS itself has two OSes on board: QTS and Android.  The first is to organize the work of the network drive, all services and applications.  And the second is available when you connect a display or projector to the HDMI port.  We get a media player based on Android with all the features: installing third-party programs, games, and more.  Most importantly, access to the repository is provided, which means that you can play movies directly from the drive.  It remains to put the screen and take the best places.  If the community is interested in the technical features of the two operating systems, I can make a separate review - I myself was interested in this experience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e79/27f/707/e7927f707b154aa08b5c66efc5047475.JPG"><br><br>  Watching movies on the background of the sunset by the river is really fascinating.  And the most interesting places managed to take thanks to Aerobatons. <br><br>  <b>Aerobaton</b> <br>  I must say that this is an extremely pleasant thing to relax.  I often see on the forums the cries of sofa experts that we have not been able to produce anything.  Therefore, I even brought this device into a separate paragraph. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a69/582/595/a69582595081473c94483301731bb727.JPG"><br><br>  <a href="http://aerobaton.ru/">Aerobaton</a> is a comfortable and enjoyable lounger.  Someone may argue that this is a copy of the western LAMZAC, but no - these devices differ fundamentally: the development and distinctive feature of a Russian manufacturer from Omsk is that the outer fabric cover is independent of the inner film sleeve.  And if an American lounger is accidentally pierced, then it will have to be either very expensive to repair or to throw out.  And with the Russian Aerobaton everything is much simpler: the puncture site is sealed from the inside with a good adhesive tape, for example, 3M.  The second repair option is even simpler - the entire inner film sleeve is replaced.  And the replacement of this sleeve will cost only 350 rubles! <br>  Someone like me, and I supported the domestic producer and I hope that he will firmly stand on the financial support of compatriots. <br>  This lounger is inflated, with due experience, in several movements, and the air is kept for 10-12 hours.  In the video, the second time in my life I picked up aerobaton, because I blew a little longer than usual. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/njuPx721KFE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjWDujV1VutLqR4aH53UEDMoVpArg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br>  Of course, entertainment and recreation are not limited to watching movies on the river bank, fishing and riding on the river.  But any rest is a change of activity, but I wanted to tell you that in Russia you can relax comfortably and beautifully.  At such a camper, not everywhere you can drive, but it all depends on the preparation.  At the beginning of the text, I already mentioned that a lot depends on preparation and two weeks before departure I drove around the neighborhood with a camera and took pictures of nature to know for sure if we could drive, would we interfere with any of the local residents and would not interfere Are we drunk companies?  The organization of proper and cultural recreation even includes such trifles as household waste disposal.  We took a big tank and a couple of packs of 200 liter packages - that was enough to clear the shore before setting up the camp and cleaning the camp after leaving.  But how many banks killed broken bottles and scattered debris.  But the topic of garbage is almost endless, so I do not even want to start it. <br>  You can not do without a brief tour of the camper.  And next time I will talk in detail about the interior of our mobile home and the work of all its nodes. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/YhkWa0PCwkI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjzIm2TKRCO5SXoyi_22Cd6KJ-TJQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395773/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395773/</a></p>
