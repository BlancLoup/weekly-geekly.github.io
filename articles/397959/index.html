      Success in the field of machine translation is another achievement of AI, of which there have been quite a lot lately.  The technology of trained neural networks is clearly on the rise and is used in different areas.  Particularly clear superiority over other computer technicians is achieved in image recognition and games.  In some of the areas, neural networks work even more efficiently than the human brain, for example, they beat a person into separate board games. <br><br>  Google‚Äôs neural network for machine translation is called the Neural Machine Translation System (NMTS).  From the very beginning to the end, the translation of the text now fully performs the neural network.  Traditionally, AI has been used on Google Translate in limited mode, for some supporting tasks.  For example, to compare texts available in several languages, such as official documents of the United Nations or the European Parliament.  In this mode, the translation of each word in the texts was compared. <br><br>  NMTS neural network works on a fundamentally new level.  It not only analyzes the existing translation options in the learning process, but also performs intellectual analysis of the sentences, breaking them up into ‚Äúvocabulary segments‚Äù.  In a certain representation within the network, these ‚Äúvocabulary segments‚Äù correspond to the <i>meanings of words</i> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d3/d48/157/5d3d48157b02496a9e66078834ea5142.gif"><br>  <i>The Google animation shows how the Chinese proposal is broken into parts, and then the neural network selects a suitable translation, given the weight of each fragment in the original text.</i> <br><br>  In a sense, this approach resembles the work of neural networks in machine vision.  The system processes the image pixel by pixel.  Then the level of processing gradually increases, reaching such complex features as object borders, geometric patterns, etc.  In NMTS, the same neural network that analyzes the source text, then offers its translation. <br><br>  In this case, Google developers have applied existing developments in this area, as well as several ‚Äúmethodological innovations,‚Äù independent experts <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/deep-learning-boosts-google-translate-tool-1.20696">commented on</a> a scientific paper published on arXiv.org.  According to them, the development of Google shows a "stunning" result and clearly demonstrates that neural translation using AI can <i>far</i> surpass the classical methods of machine translation in quality.  Google's neural network clearly improves translation quality in many ways. <br><br>  For optimization, NMTS was run-in on computer equipment specially designed for testing the neural network.  It was there that AlphaGo neural network was trained at one time, which then <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/272782/">defeated Lee Sedol</a> , one of the world's best go players. <br><br>  To assess the effectiveness of the system, researchers have picked up a large set of proposals from Wikipedia and news articles on the Internet.  These texts fed the NMTS, the old Google Translate machine translation system, and also gave people-translators.  In the framework of blind testing, human translators assessed the quality of the translation of each fragment (including the human translation). <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Examples of translation of texts in Chinese, Spanish, French and English with the usual machine translation system (blue), neural network (green) and man (orange)</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/625/086/009/6250860098634a6a8dcd8482e0b5d2ac.png"></div></div><br>  The English-Chinese language pair is known for its high complexity.  Despite a significant decrease in the number of errors, the quality of translation in this language pair is still inferior to the quality of translation of other Indo-European languages.  In some language pairs, the translation of NMTS is close in quality to the translation by people, but the authors of scientific work warn that it is early to make far-reaching conclusions, because the comparison was made on a limited set of carefully selected simple sentences. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91e/d49/e0b/91ed49e0b6564d2d9ae44dab5c7c5302.png"><br><br>  The same results in a more visual form. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c4/1fa/2a0/9c41fa2a02134a8fb0b326df7e910d7a.png"><br><br>  According to experts, a computer can approach or bypass a person in terms of the quality of translation only if additional channels of incoming information are connected to the machine translation system.  Not only text, but also video, and sound.  ‚ÄúIn the future, robots will be able to move, manipulate objects, feel pain through pain sensors and express their feelings in the text,‚Äù <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/deep-learning-boosts-google-translate-tool-1.20696">says</a> J√ºrgen Schmidhuber from the University of Lugano (Switzerland). <br><br>  The Google Translate system currently processes about 10,000 language pairs for machine translation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397959/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397959/</a></p>
