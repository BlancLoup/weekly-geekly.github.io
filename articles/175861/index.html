  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Female look at PocketBook Surfpad</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Devices from the lower price segment often leave behind bewilderment and the desire to wash their hands before you take something decently.  And only some gadgets manage to make a pleasant impression.  7-inch PocketBook SURFpad is one of them. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/529/f62/457/529f62457af2c8a2def9c47519a1d120.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  His fate, however, is complicated and confused.  The manufacturer calls the PocketBook SURFpad a reader - but with classic models equipped with an E-Ink display, it has almost nothing in common.  As well as with "TFT-readers" - models with a cheap TFT-screen and photo frame functionality.  Still, quite powerful hardware and Android 4.1. <br>  However, the tablet is not 100% PocketBook SURFpad: where is Google Play?  Where is the back camera?  Where, finally, is a 3G modem, GPS or at least Bluetooth? <br>  Meanwhile, despite the difficulties in determining membership of a particular segment, PocketBook SURFpad copes with the functions assigned to it: it is convenient to read, it can open video in good quality, and even supports modern light toys in the overwhelming majority. <br>  In other matters, let's order. <br><br><h5>  Design </h5><br>  I do not know who exactly worked on the appearance of the "surfer", but this designer knows his work for five plus.  The gadget does not make the impression of an unknown Chinese created on the knee, locked in anyhow rectangular case (like most tablets from the category up to 4 thousand), and fascinates since the opening of an elegant white box :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e9a/a96/ca7/e9aa96ca7bf8983b78b775a4107e16a7.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/003/fd2/c69/003fd2c691e464ac437f463d3e0d99f5.jpg"><br><habracut>

      The wide frame around the display makes SURFpad more solid, but not only for this.  On the wide short sides there are small grooves to keep it more comfortable.  And this "more convenient" works in any position of the gadget. <br><br>  On the rear panel, the corresponding areas are not smooth, but ‚Äúin the hole‚Äù.  The central part is covered with velvety plastic with a slightly protruding inscription Obreey.  In general, the ‚Äúsurfer‚Äù can only be dropped intentionally, he does not jump out of the hands. <br><br>  Dimensions and weight are close to ideal - it is convenient to use, the bag does not weigh down, it fits in one hand. <br>  Buttons and connectors are also located well: on top - power and volume, on the right - headphones, miniUSB and a slot for microSD cards.  It, by the way, is needed, especially for movie lovers: there are only 4 GB inside. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b0d/50c/576/b0d50c5768faa6d439b324711a2d6241.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2c7/f2f/985/2c7f2f98580c5c98d362e8b7da9070c1.jpg"><br><br>  Special thanks to the developers for the speakers in front, not in the back, where they are often placed.  Thanks to the recesses, the fingers do not close the sound holes, and the music sounds in full (and not bad, I dare say). <br><br>  In general, the device made a lasting impression on me "mimimi" (I'm a girl, I can!).  It is especially pronounced in the white version, especially since it is difficult to stain the case and easy to clean.  The gray model also does not look dull, but still less attractive to me, as the fair sex. <br><br><h5>  <b>Screen</b> </h5><br>  The screen in the PocketBook SURFpad by today's standards is rather weak - only 800 x 480 pixels.  But the brightness gradations abound, the viewing angles are quite decent, the sun almost does not fade.  You can browse the Internet and watch movies without any problems.  "Grain" is not noticeable either in games or while watching a video. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/625/f11/66e/625f1166e42de78113d532e9116cfb2b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/002/ca3/7fe/002ca37fe62df04b4dbeafb4894c1349.png"><br><br>  By the way, in the first picture - the screen before the update, on the second - with the update, which will be discussed below (Yandex.Store, SPB TV can be seen, etc. I downloaded the benchmarks myself).  Therefore, after purchasing the reader, immediately update it and get a more functional device :) <br><br><h5>  <b>Inside</b> </h5><br>  I liked the functional content less.  In the name of reducing the cost of production from PocketBook SURFpad cut off all unnecessary and, possibly, something necessary.  A modest list of connectors leaves little room for maneuver.  Well, at least USB Host is supported, you can connect a flash drive or a 3G modem. <br><br>  Inside the gadget beats a small heart Cortex A8 with a clock frequency of 1 GHz.  Benchmark &amp; ‚Äã‚ÄãTuning Free rated the performance at 1712 points, it‚Äôs better than the HTC Sensation XL and a little worse than the Sony Ericsson ST18i.  Full HD-movie (1920 x 1080) opened, but slowed down noticeably.  There were no problems with HD video. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d87/57f/739/d8757f739d36b4ab9e1203e87997bd38.png"><br><br>  As a gaming platform PocketBook SURFpad like the Jungle Jumper will go, but something more difficult - only in the "text mode".  Need for drift, for example, did not start at all. <br>  And what about the more famous games?  And here opens another, and probably the most important drawback - the lack of Google Play.  Yes, the device on Android 4.1.1 does not support this app store, and if you are used to a large selection and are attached to certain applications in your smartphone, wean and otkipite. <br><br>  However, to call it ‚Äúempty‚Äù my keyboard will not turn.  First, SURFpad has surprisingly many useful programs installed.  There is, for example, Office Suite Pro, which allows you to fully work with office files (which helped me a lot when the laptop came to the university the day before the seminar - I had to do a SURFpad presentation. And nothing happened :)) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/732/8d3/07f/7328d307f2205f4d8fb9020dcc85e44a.png"><br><br>  There are widgets for Vkontakte and Odnoklassniki, weather from Gismeteo, search and maps of Yandex. <br>  There is a universal IM + messenger, from which you can also get into social networks or communicate via ICQ, Mail.Ru Agent, Google Talk, Jabber and other similar applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/679/b8b/1f7/679b8b1f787f8ff027fdc7ee19ca23fc.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7f5/677/5a3/7f56775a34a320a8be7483a67fed5ca7.png"><br><br>  There is also a rather interesting program: Obreey Diary: you can record class schedules and tasks and monitor your progress.  For schoolchildren and their parents (and nerd students) will fit perfectly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/943/c44/734/943c4473418e8584f1132b65b4f6b6e4.png"><br><br>  Secondly, thanks to the SPB TV application PocketBook SURFpad turns into a TV.  For this, of course, you need Wi-Fi.  The broadcast quality is average, but you can watch your favorite show or news without any problems.  For example, I even enjoyed the viewing of the match between Rubin and Chelsea. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b5d/5e1/9a6/b5d5e19a615cf0303521f2d0eaf4f3c9.png"><br><br>  Well and, thirdly, as befits the reader, it has a program for reading - CoolReader.  You can choose the font and size, and download books from the online libraries or the Obreey Store.  The inscription PocketBook on the case obliges SURFpad to understand most of the formats, including finished books in EPUB and FB2. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/080/3cc/06f/0803cc06f11f15b0e3550d99266bb016.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/54a/d31/bb6/54ad31bb614aecaf62fcd4a74f6b67b1.png"><br><br>  All this stuff, you say, global feed.  And please!  The latest SURFpad firmware supports Yandex.Store, where more than 50 thousand programs are announced.  Access to it opens the same way as with Google Play, but you need a box not on Gmail, but on Yandex.Mail. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/270/dfe/a3d/270dfea3d7af55908d44e9f87ba2dbaf.png"><br><br>  There are really many applications there, but not always exactly what is needed.  There are not many familiar games, almost no performance tests, few games for children.  However, it opened recently, and there is hope for improving the content.  Or maybe on Google Play in perspective?  :) <br><br>  Contrary to popular belief, Skype on PocketBook SURFpad was launched even before access to the Yandex store.  In the above mentioned IM + application there is also a blue icon with the letter S. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f25/afe/2a7/f25afe2a74402a09949db2bd65f593f6.png"><br><br>  For visual communication, a modest 0.3 megapixel camera is provided to the right of the display.  Nothing special, but it's good that it exists at all!  She can take pictures, but the result is sent strictly in "Vkontakte" or "Classmates".  You can also copy the photo via USB.  I decided to send it by mail, for which I had to open the box, find a picture in the memory of the surfer, attach and send. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1a8/298/8fb/1a82988fbe86135ef59e7aaafe1e3efb.jpg"><br><br><h5>  <b>Results</b> </h5><br>  And here we again return to the issue of price.  For the opportunity to give only 3.5 thousand instead of 10-15 this thing you can literally forgive everything.  It works stably and for quite a long time (almost 6.5 hours without recharging), it looks more expensive than it costs, it gives a movie to watch, and sit on the Net, play and work.  Well, read, where do without it, if we are talking about the reader.  Although, nevertheless, I agree that the "real" reader should be on E-ink. <br><br>  In short, as the first all-in-one device, the PocketBook SURFpad fits perfectly. <br><br>  But Google.Play is not enough, yes. </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/175861/">https://habr.com/ru/post/175861/</a></p>
