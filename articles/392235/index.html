And this is despite the fact that only the lazy ones didn‚Äôt sing their innovations, high-quality interface, advanced micro-animation, etc. in their time.  So what went wrong?

      Using this tribune, I want to express my own subjective point of view and give predictions that new cuts in the development of any wearable gadgets will soon not be unavoidable.  The fact is that instead of a man carrying a suitcase at the ready, a new type of personality is emerging before our eyes, and the man of the future cannot be considered in the old way: as some kind of character from an old-fashioned RPG who just needs to hang around with all sorts of stuff, money, weapons and spells, where the drawing of virtual servants, dragging all this habr for the main character - the game has always saved their budgets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/626/d51/11e/626d5111e4930dc440f21351a1a2b7dc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I agree, twenty years ago and in the conventional world of the game - it looked cool, but now in the real world, I'm sorry, it's all just a mockery of a person.  Over a living person. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c9a/ec3/9d3/c9aec39d3ca6d752dae9b1bce6aa764d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Let us think how many screens you need to carry with you now to look like a cool and progressive consumer of information?  A smartphone, a tablet, a watch - UV, while only three.  And soon they will add another screen on Google-glasses, then the screen on the ring, the screen in the car, where else?  And each will go advertising, because everyone will have to do their business: all these endless push-notifications, alerts, mailings, spam, news ... <br><br>  How much do you need to hate people in order to seriously argue that the person of the future will want to carry with him more and more different-sized devices equipped with monitors, input / output devices and display of paid banners? <br><br>  Of course, science fiction films also play their part, where directors who have not completed the necessary courses in British take on designing scenarios for the interaction of information and man in 20-50-100 years.  You don‚Äôt have to believe this, because in any fantastic cinema itself, the main thing is to show the drama of relations between people and to wrap up the plot brighter, and working out the laws and logic of the world, working with Occam‚Äôs razor to get rid of unnecessary entities often fades into the background.  So it turns out something like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d32/b3a/b74/d32b3ab745b849fe8c8b440044d1ca1b.jpg"><br><br>  In fact, very, very soon, there will be no separate monitors at all.  No one.  But at the same time, the screen for working with information will be everything at once, any object that is not necessarily flat and is not necessarily intended for carrying and personal use.  The necessary information for each person will be requested and displayed on the walls of houses, on poles, on cars - that is, literally everywhere.  Any subject of the real world will be an informer of the person of the future, in order to unload it once and for all from dragging hundreds of gadgets and tons of plastic bank cards onto itself, as hapless UX experts born in the 20th century try to impose on us today. <br><br>  Imagine a pedestrian crossing the road and reading on the oncoming car specifically for him the displayed information about the high probability of a collision.  Imagine a person reading news right on the wall of a house or calling a friend from a garbage can.  The whole world should and will speak to us, and not just a piece of plastic in our pocket. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d66/3d9/7da/d663d97dad3040709d5a3d5151ab4d04.jpg"><br><br>  The world should open to humanity and begin to interact with it all entirely, and not just some of its areas.  There should not be separate phones or laptops, since you can write text or make a video using any object at all - a football, a lamppost, your own cap, etc.  Each item produced will be multifunctional, unified, with convenient feedback, and most importantly - not requiring constant dragging on itself. <br><br>  There should not be a separate smart home, smart watch or smart car - all the power needs to be thrown to create a smart world, an open world, an endless info-environment in which every object we create will learn to prompt, instruct and stream video. <br><br>  Completely new gestures will come to replace today's familiar actions: clicks, tapas and swipes.  So, for example, to select a zone of a wall or a window to start interaction - the user will first trace the space he needs - to form his own temporary screen with the proportions and resolution he needs: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f97/f9d/9db/f97f9d9db3b040718bd262fa06deebc4.jpg"><br><br>  You can develop this idea to infinity, but I think the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmy prediction about the imminent collapse of the entire market for individual gadgets that are carried around with you is clear.  So, the main conclusions from today's article will be the banal in general things that the first in the future will get those who are trying to free the user from unnecessary entities and actions.  Unfortunately, today's UX experts do not yet suspect how important for each of us is freedom in the matter of getting along without daily hauling documents and keys, an umbrella and credit cards, smartphones and watches, glasses and bags;  therefore, they spend time and effort on working through the internal animations and rounding at the interface buttons, as if it affects the impending future. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/392235/">https://habr.com/ru/post/392235/</a></p>
