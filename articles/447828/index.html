  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How we do IT for people in Rostelecom</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In most companies, IT departments are roughly the same.  Yes, the systems used to process applications, the number of operators, their workload, the range of problems they are able to solve, and so on may differ. <br><br>  But they have one thing in common.  IT works for the needs of business and sales above all.  That is, the most important priority in these departments is large projects aimed at increasing profits.  But because of this, they often forget about the people themselves, who write in IT, and their desires.  There is no time for this, and all the useful suggestions remain somewhere in the notes, to which IT specialists then get as often as you do before bookmarking in the browser six months ago. <br><br>  In some companies, sometimes it even comes to the point that IT people from support often hide behind faceless requests and communicate with other employees or customers only with tickets.  So it turns out that such an attitude towards IT harms the company in terms of its internal brand - other employees are beginning to consider IT people not very attentive.  IT specialists, in turn, get a little pleasure from routine tasks.

      We at Rostelecom decided to change this situation with the help of the IT for People program.  Because it turns out that we can launch large projects, but there are usually no small, but important improvements within the company. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This is a unified program that we scale for the entire company, but as a pilot we started from Moscow.  IT employees participate in it exclusively on a voluntary basis, it is not part of the KPI.  Yes, by the way, besides people from the support program there are people from related departments, for example, from business and guys from HR.  That is, these are the people who themselves know well what needs may arise from our employees or from the company's clients.  Having collected the most frequent pains, we can quickly work out solutions that close this pain. <br><br>  As a motivation for those who decide to participate, the very opportunity to change something works well, especially if you suggested it.  For example, an IT employee is no longer just sitting and processing applications, closing the template link or quick response, but he can offer some kind of additional Wishlist himself. <br><br>  Which will be able to help product users or colleagues from other departments. <br><br>  It is also important to constantly talk about this within the company, because the company is really huge, and many employees from other cities and divisions may simply not know exactly what we are doing and how, how it can help colleagues today.  People need to understand what IT is doing and how it applies to employees.  we do not lay down any long tasks, everything is built around the so-called quick win - invented, tested, implemented, and that's it, people use something new after a couple of weeks from the day you invented it. <br><br>  That's where we started. <br><br><h2>  Simplify IT procedures </h2><br>  Here we try to make all procedures as transparent, intuitive and fast for the end user as possible.  We were able to speed up the onboarding of a new employee as much as possible - his workplace becomes ready for work on the first day.  Including the equipment itself, and all the necessary access for a person, you no longer have to wait until everyone connects, sets up, and then also gives rights step by step.  We reworked the application forms themselves, so that all the data that is already in the system was automatically substituted, and the user did not have to manually enter his position several times, the name of the manager, and similar information.  Yes, Rostelecom is a very large company with a huge number of employees, but we already manage to reduce the level of bureaucracy in the framework of this project.  We want to reduce it further, in other regions and divisions. <br><br><h2>  IT School </h2><br>  ‚ÄúIT for people‚Äù actively trains employees, increasing their general literacy in terms of software, including not only the one they need in their work, but generally any software that is familiar to humans.  From formulas in Excel to hotkeys in a graphical editor, from useful photo applications for a smartphone and other trifles to basic repair and maintenance of a personal PC. <br><br>  We began to issue a special internal journal IT Tips for this purpose.  And this is just the beginning. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2u/ie/ez/2uieez0wmcrvebh7n2xsjz_dvtm.png"><br><br><h2>  Improving working conditions </h2><br>  Here everything revolves around trifles, which at first glance either do not notice, or are considered unnecessary.  But then, when you introduce this trifle into the process, it takes root and it is actively used, it will already be missed. <br><br>  We were so with the banal charges in the negotiations.  After all, team meetings and discussions may well last from half an hour to several hours.  During this time, the smartphone can be actively discharged, because either the discussion is interesting and you write something on the voice recorder, or for promptness you connect via speakerphone another colleague from your personal phone - both scenarios land the battery, then you need to (later ) look for charging and a free outlet.  We installed the chargers in the conversations and solved this problem. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gd/lc/qz/gdlcqzx664hfmyqc1muq-aob89m.png"><br><br>  In the summer, we took the staff to work outdoors, renting a site in Neskuchny Garden.  The change of the bored office to an open area was expected to have a good effect on both the result of the work of the guys and their attitude towards the plant itself.  We plan to scale up this practice in the regions, now we are looking for sites. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mb/dr/dg/mbdrdg52fcq0u96atx6e_wuuy9m.png"><br><br>  This also includes the expansion of partnerships in terms of discounts for employees.  Rostelecom not only has a lot of employees, but also partners and contractors, including other prominent IT players whose products are used by millions of people.  Here the task for the project was to establish the possibility of receiving special offers for such employees from such partners.  As a result, so far this translates into the fact that colleagues can buy for themselves (for personal use) certain software at a discount of 20-30% of the market price.  For example, Kaspersky Internet Security, Total Security, Safe Kids, Microsoft Office suites and more. <br><br>  The same was done in partnership with one of the smartphone manufacturers, the employee needs a new phone, he makes a purchase as an employee of Rostelecom and receives our corporate discount.  Such preferential programs have become the norm for many large players, but we plan to constantly expand its borders and replenish the staff of such partners. <br><br>  Now we are negotiating to create and other trifles of the type of preferential corporate taxi in the city, when an employee needs to get from one office to another (we have enough offices). <br><br><h2>  Attitude towards customers </h2><br>  We were able to quite actively reformat the first line of support for internal customers (that is, company employees), having done the most important thing - we removed the scripts from the guys and left only small basic instructions.  Now, a person should not have the feeling that he is talking to a robot; IT guys are trying to help the user during the first call. <br><br>  In addition, an employee who communicates with a client will now receive basic information on the screen about where a person is calling from - this is useful when a person from Kamchatka (it happens) who has 19.00 calls to the Moscow office at 10 am, and the operator tells him "Andrei, good morning!"  Andrew looks at the sunset Kamchatka sun and shrugs. <br><br>  The plans are to complete this system so that employees can use even more information.  For example, an employee will see in a convenient interface the time zone, the weather in the city where the client is calling from, will be able to receive basic data such as birthday and the like so that you can congratulate the person on the holiday (coming or past). <br><br>  All these are the little things that make IT more humane in general and a little closer to the customer in a good way. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIT for people‚Äù is now seen precisely as a platform for collecting useful ideas for implementation within companies and sharing experience.  Now the program has been successfully operating for several years at Alfa-Bank and Otkrytie Bank, now we are carefully implementing it already within the framework of Rostelecom. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nw/5p/s0/nw5ps0uw8xmmdidvfqqzdnziqi0.png"><br><br>  And it will be great if such programs will be launched in other companies as well - for this we are holding the first IT <a href="https://www.itforlife-technograd.info/">conference</a> for people, it will be held on April 16 in Tehnograd ( <a href="https://yandex.ru/maps/213/moscow/%3Fll%3D37.632197%252C55.835048%26mode%3Dsearch%26sll%3D37.622504%252C55.753215%26sspn%3D1.359558%252C0.474758%26text%3D%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580.%2520%25D0%259C%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%252C%2520119%2520%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%252063%252C%26z%3D16">Prospekt Mira, 119, p. 63</a> ). <br><br>  The idea itself remains the same - a good business should not only work for the client, but also think about its own employees. <br><br>  It is clear that without business and sales, the company will not have a profit, because there will be fewer customers. <br><br>  But without employees, the company will have nothing at all. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/447828/">https://habr.com/ru/post/447828/</a></p>
