We invited Jon Berger, a marketing professor at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, as a keynote speaker to shed more light on this issue. <br><br>  Author of the bestseller "Viral effect: Why are we attracted to something."  Mr. Berger shared his view on this topic.  This can help marketers create better messages for users. <br><br>  For example, Berger found out that word of mouth more than doubles sales.  Listeners were surprised that only 7% of word of mouth communications is online.  According to Berger, ‚Äúyou cannot mark the link in a private conversation.  Go beyond technology, think about psychology. ‚Äù <br><br>  How can you create a viral effect when promoting your product or service?  If at the same time in your message there is nothing interesting and exciting? <br><br>  As Professor Berger explained, there are 6 points to achieve a viral effect: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Social significance</b> - to give subscribers a sense of importance, increase their self-esteem </li><li>  <b>Triggers</b> - come up with something easy to remember about your product / service </li><li>  <b>Emotions</b> - add emotions to messages </li><li>  <b>Publicity</b> - to make content that you want to share </li><li>  <b>Practical value</b> - ask yourself whether it can be put into practice. </li><li>  <b>Stories</b> - provide "live" examples that show the benefits of your product / service </li></ul><br><br>  In order to demonstrate the use of the ‚ÄúSocial Significance‚Äù item, Berger spoke about a secret bar located in a New York eatery.  When you get there, you have to go to a non-ordinary phone booth and reserve a place in a bar called ‚ÄúPlease, don't tell.‚Äù  The lucky ones who enter this bar go through the secret door.  The only way to find out about this bar is word of mouth. <br><br>  The bar is always full, even though there is no sign outside.  This is an example of one trendy trend.  Similar places open across the country.  Why are they so popular?  They came up with a little secret, and anyone who knows her feels ‚Äúinitiated.‚Äù  This is the "social significance." <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhat we say and what we share creates an impression about us.  Make your customers look good in the eyes of others.  Then they will be more willing to share your message, ‚Äùsaid Berger. <br><br>  If we talk about e-mail marketing, you can apply this technique.  Tell subscribers news under the guise of insider information.  They will be happy to share it. <br><br>  Triggers are also key to creating viral content.  For example, if you thought about the beach, an advertisement for the Corona beer brand is often remembered.  If you hear the phrase "peanut butter", then the word "paste" comes to mind.  Such a trigger helps to easily capture the attention of consumers. <br><br>  ‚ÄúGet to the bottom.  If you want people to send a message to each other, ask questions.  What kind of message are you creating?  Would you like information to be viral? ‚ÄùSaid Berger. <br><br>  <b>Reinforce mob incentives and instincts</b> <br><br>  On the second day of the summit, we discussed Stephen Dubner‚Äôs latest book, Thoughts Like a Freak. <br>  ‚ÄúWhat you or I do is very similar.  We try to understand what people really want when they talk about something, ‚Äùsaid Dubner. <br><br>  He asked to raise the hands of those who do not wash their hands after visiting the toilet.  Of course, none of the audience admitted to this.  As stated by Dubner, this refers to data accuracy.  He explained that his study shows that about 30% of men do not wash their hands after using the toilet.  So what does this mean in the case of digital marketing? <br>  ‚ÄúThe circumstances in which information is gathered affect the reliability of this data.  We would like this data to reflect the real situation.  At the same time, we can easily convince ourselves to select such data that will confirm our hypothesis, ‚Äùhe said. <br><br>  This is the case when what we declare one, and do another.  ‚ÄúWe do not want to admit it.  But this is not an intentional lie.  We want to behave in a certain way and do not conduct ... ulterior motives affect human behavior, whether we like it or not, ‚Äùcontinued Dubner. <br><br>  He gave an example that shows the difference between declared and identified preferences: <br>  An energy company in San Diego needed to increase the number of consumers who use ceiling fans in the summer, not air conditioners.  So the company was going to increase the amount of state funding. <br><br>  And here they are conducting a telephone survey in which they are asked to note the importance of the following motives for energy saving: <br><br>  <i>1. Reducing financial costs</i> <i><br></i>  <i>2. Preservation of the environment</i> <i><br></i>  <i>3. Benefits for society</i> <br><br>  The fourth motive was completely from another song: <br>  <i>4. Many are going to do it.</i> <br><br>  Naturally, most chose the first two motives.  A small number of people indicated the third motive.  And no one chose the fourth paragraph, which refers to the herd instinct.  After all, we want to seem prudent and clever, and not people who follow the crowd. <br><br>  Then the researchers conducted another experiment.  On each door handle, an advertisement was posted that motivated consumers to use ceiling fans.  5 versions of the advertising booklet were made.  The first version is about the general benefit of energy savings, and the other four versions reflected the four motives indicated above.  After the measurement, it turned out that the most used ceiling fans were consumers who were given an advertisement with point number 4 (about the herd instinct).  Although no one indicated this motive in a telephone survey. <br><br>  Why it happens?  In our difficult life, being in a group is easier than being alone.  If people around you are doing something, for example, they save energy, you will most likely also do so. <br><br>  As stated in the book Think Like Freak, ‚ÄúIf you develop motivational programs, you can apply this knowledge.  To encourage consumers to do the right thing, even if they do it for the wrong reasons. ‚Äù <br>  "You would like people to act correctly, but studies prove that you need to collect data showing how people will actually behave in response to your message." <br><br><h4>  Tip # 2: Use all available information to keep in touch with subscribers </h4><br>  The organizer of the "Kentucky Derby" race, wanted to increase the number of responses through e-mail marketing.  In general, a typical task for most professionals.  ‚ÄúKentucky Derby‚Äù was planning to increase ticket sales and attract advertising sponsors with the help of newsletters. <br><br>  For this purpose, Jeff Coleba, vice president of marketing, and Kate Ellis, a marketing analyst at the Kentucky Derby, decided to use data from subscriber behavioral factors to better communicate with the audience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f8/bfb/a6f/7f8bfba6f5ab4bc7abf02dbb2dfef6a6.jpg"><br><br>  They analyzed the weekly newsletter, which is held from February to May (before the event).  Thus, we managed to collect the behavioral motives of our subscribers in three sections of this newsletter: social life, horse riding, game aspects.  Then, the received data was used in a new e-mail campaign. <br><br>  Analysis of the transitions in the three sections of the newsletter helped to identify content that is of interest to subscribers, as well as content that is largely ignored.  ‚ÄúYou can use this channel to find out what your customers are most interested in and what content leads to the sale,‚Äù explained Ellis.  ‚ÄúThe more you learn about your customers, the better you will be able to prepare such content that will interest them. <br><br>  Deserve the right to sell to your customers.  First, build good customer relationships and find out who they are.  Customers who are interested are easier to sell, ‚ÄùEllis continued. <br><br>  <b>Study user behavior to hold them.</b> <br><br>  Retaining customers is much easier than finding new ones.  This is true for all industries, and this is what Diana Primo, the head of CNET customer service, is doing.  In her presentation, she showed how to attract new users and retain existing customers through a segmented e-mail list. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI work in an area where the number of subscribers is not important.  The level of engagement is important, ‚ÄùPrimo said. <br>  As soon as the company starts working with a new client, presenting a wide range of services, an optionally mailing based on the interests of this user is sent to the client. <br><br>  Primo went further and tried to compare the segmented and non-segmented newsletter.  Thus, it was possible to understand the value of segmented content that best serves the interests of users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ae/7d3/141/1ae7d314198f40d99965dbc3788fa249.jpg"><br><br>  In one test, Primo took a technical newsletter and added there the prepared information for subscribers who are interested in the smart home, various devices and devices.  This newsletter was made on the basis of information about users, their behavior, following links and remarketing.  This mailing increased click-through rate by 307%, proving the value of segmented mailing. <br><br>  "It's amazing.  You get new customers who want to know who you are, they are interested in your site.  This is the great value of all new users, that they are very, very interested, ‚ÄùPrimo said. <br><br>  <b>Use existing data</b> <br><br>  If you set a serious goal to build a comprehensive integrated system for e-mail marketing, then this can take a lot of time.  What can be done at this time? <br><br>  Shona Dalin, senior marketing manager for Microsoft's online store, told how her team applied customer data that they had already collected.  The team was able in a short time to increase the return on e-mail newsletters and increase consumer involvement. <br><br>  They collected customer data, including from vendors, and specialists within the company. <br>  So they were able to segment the audience, based on information about the purchases made, sources of attraction, as well as geographic data about the client. <br><br>  Having received this information, the specialists were able to better understand the customer‚Äôs route and see key areas of interaction with the company and thereby increase the customer‚Äôs life cycle. Gradually improving the content with the collected information, personalizing and segmenting the newsletters, the team was able to increase the return on e-mail marketing by 1200% for three years. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAlthough, as before, we do a lot of things manually, we began to talk more meaningfully to our subscribers.  We are progressing, leaving behind the tactic of ‚Äúspray and pray,‚Äù which was used a year ago, ‚Äùsaid Dahlin. <br>  And while a long-term strategy is being implemented, Dalin and her team will use the data to better meet customer needs. <br><br><h4>  <b>Tip # 3: Use e-mail and content to shorten the path from conversion to transaction</b> </h4><br>  The process of growing potential customers through several content channels and targeted messages is based on an understanding of which sales cycle they are on.  This is a key moment in the sales mix. <br><br>  However, what happens when your CRM system is not integrated into the process of growing leads? <br>  Precor marketing specialists faced this problem and were able to increase the number of leads by 75%.  This was done by deep segmentation of the client base. <br><br>  Stephen Bruner, Precor marketing manager, shared his thoughts on what they learned.  Precor, a leading manufacturer of fitness equipment, has refined its CRM system so that it helps plan personalized content marketing depending on the sales cycle. <br><br>  This strategy allowed Precor to identify potential customers, as well as to understand what information about the equipment they still need.  So the company was able to plan and launch an automated newsletter.  The letters served as a means of content delivery, depending on what the visitor was interested in on the site. <br><br>  When the leads became warmer, the team could see potential customers' interest in specific products during their further passage through the sales funnel. At the top of the funnel, the company uses various booklets and reference books for customers, as well as infographics.  These products are made by the company itself.  In addition, blogs and video content are involved. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b31/f09/ae8/b31f09ae84264f0caad74261510301ba.jpg"><br><br>  As soon as the transaction stage approaches, Precor begins to use various sales tools and sends more content in the form of research and reports to the leaders in order to win the competition. Finally, when the sales stage comes, automation is turned off and marketers are activated at the service stage. <br><br>  But even after the transaction, Precor seeks to develop relationships with customers, providing them with useful information, to improve the business of the customers themselves. <br><br><h4>  <b>Tip # 4: Strengthen the consumer experience</b> </h4><br>  Mary Abramson, an e-mail marketing specialist for Ferguson Enterprises, who was nominated for the ‚ÄúBest in Show Organization‚Äù title, shared how the company changed its approach to e-mail marketing and trade shows for better interaction with customers and leads. <br><br>  Before the campaign, a team of marketers identified a problem with the way of communication with the target audience, which consisted of experts in the field of air conditioning and ventilation, plumbers and electricians.  Did the company deliver the right content for all of these activities? <br><br>  So they segmented subscribers through the newsletter, in which they asked to indicate their scope of activity.  It was, as Mary Abramson said, ‚Äúone click miracle.‚Äù <br><br>  This helped subscribers to identify by industry, and the company began to send relevant content.  ‚ÄúThere was a low entrance threshold.  Many companies use this approach to get feedback and reviews.  Now you know why this is called ‚Äúone click miracle,‚Äù said Mary Abramson. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4db/2b6/2a5/4db2b62a51df4fb5b0c168b4de0bbadc.png"><br><br>  Thus, the team was able to deliver more valuable and relevant content to the right recipients.  So they were able to receive specialized product offers, relevant content, etc. <br><br>  Also, to improve the holding of exhibitions and other events, the team focused on mobile traffic.  Various forms of request for mobile devices have been optimized for better interaction with site visitors. <br><br>  The result of the work to improve customer experience was the achievement of sales of more than $ 21 million. In the 12 months, the team conducted 92 e-mail marketing campaigns.  More than half of the visitors to the exhibitions reported that they had learned about the event through the newsletter. <br><br>  Mary Abramson found the best way to communicate with customers, including offline, extending their user experience.  ‚ÄúTake a look at the big picture.  Many customers do not want to share information.  Give them that opportunity and send them relevant letters, ‚ÄùAbramson said. <br><br><h4>  <b>Tip # 5: Combine all efforts for a multi-channel approach.</b> </h4><br>  Finish Line, the winner of the ‚ÄúBest in Show‚Äù award in the B2C category, applied basic segmentation to personalize the distribution.  But the experts wanted to increase the relevance of messages by further segmentation and the use of additional communication channels. <br><br>  What is the result?  Aaron Buchanan, digital marketing manager, launched a new mailing automation platform.  This system allowed us to work simultaneously with 300 segments, which was important as the holiday season approached. <br><br>  These newsletters included letters with motivators, messages on the loyalty program, letters, etc. Aaron Buchanan went further and unified all marketing activity in all channels of communication with customers.  The team made one all advertising messages in mailings, on the site, in CMC shipments, in social.  networks, etc. <br><br>  The team has segmented the customer base based on the information collected.  Site statistics, previous purchases, traffic sources, information about product interest were taken into account.  This helped to identify the most interested in buying customers.  So they were able to place more targeted advertising on the Internet, make more personalized messages on the site and SMS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/005/c69/f3f/005c69f3fd274d6dbc4c9b43d7d83d53.png"><br><br>  By applying more targeted newsletters and appealing to customers through all communication channels, the Finish Line increased the effectiveness of e-mail marketing by 50%. <br><br>  ‚ÄúHonor your customer with the honor of communicating with your brand through all your communication channels,‚Äù said Aaron Buchanan. <br><br>  <b>Make e-mail marketing a key element of a multi-channel strategy.</b> <br><br>  It is not easy to deal with the concept of "multi-channel".  However, we all agree that it is based on the use of all communication channels to reach customers, wherever they are, with the help of relevant messages. <br><br>  When we talk about multi-channel, the key point is integrated e-mail marketing.  This was told by Jacqueline Kearns, senior vice president and Janine d'Allegro, vice president of Dun &amp; Bradstreet.  They showed how e-mail can be sent to a specific audience with a specific message.  Their team has developed a multi-channel strategy, with which specific content was distributed at all stages of sales. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe wanted to create catchy content based on our customer value.  Our data that we sent out was our advantage, ‚ÄùKearns said.  The team generated 7 million contacts each day, which could confuse the process.  Therefore, they had to supply the "correct" content to the "correct" users. <br><br>  With the help of the heat map, the most clickable and visible areas of the site were identified.  This allowed better display of content to interested users. <br><br>  After the work was done to improve the content and usability of the site, the team segmented its audience.  Emails have already been sent with personalized content.  Specialists have also implemented a ‚ÄúTraining Center‚Äù section on the site for better presentation of information to users.  Thus, the newsletter had to strengthen the strategy and deliver the most relevant information to the audience. <br><br>  The newsletter initiated contact with Dun &amp; Bradstreet, and the next steps in e-mail marketing returned people. <br>  Within 72 hours of mailing, the number of site views increased by 400%, and the average number of pages viewed increased to 4. This meant that visitors showed interest and wanted to learn more. <br><br>  Satisfying the need for relevant content, the team increased the number of subscribers by 210%, and the activity of messages via chat increased by 114%. <br><br>  Marketers of the company picked up this trend, improving communication channels, creating mobile applications for more convenient work with content.  The site has also been refined based on user behavior.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This allowed users from different segments to quickly find relevant information. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the future, the team will continue to work on all stages of the sales funnel, developing all channels of interaction with users. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúThe newsletter directly leads you to your customers, and you can go all the way from the request to the transaction via e-mail. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do not do it tactically, but do it strategically, ‚ÄùJeannine d'Allegro summed up.</font></font><br><br><h4> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tip number 6: Go back to basics - the necessary elements of e-mail marketing</font></font></b> </h4><br>       ,     ,        . ,    ,   ,  Litmus,  ‚Äî   ,  ‚Äî  . <br><br>    ,     ,    . <br><br>   ,   ‚Äì  .     ,         . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d0a/0d3/a30/d0a0d3a30040460d9ca9bd374d863d1a.png"><br><br>  ,  ‚Äì  .           ,    . <br><br> ¬´   .    ?¬ª,  . <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you have multiple sections in a letter, make sure that their headings are clearly separated in a consistent manner. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúIf all the headings, except for one, are made with 24 pt, this will be confusing.
