I propose to share my modest purely subjective impressions of the exhibition.  How to live in a decent society - a nice looking picture to attract attention <i>(do not hit for the white balance, the lightroom remained at work)</i> , the rest is under the cut, the traffic of megabytes is ten. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c9b/e72/201/c9be72201254eefa2493e7dbf41fa2c7.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e8f/d8c/261/e8fd8c2610e4cfca6d5229cf3f9aad69.jpg"><br>  In fact, the exhibition met me (of course, after the launch of our own stand, which I had to tinker with a bit) here is such a miracle: a hybrid of a man and a movie camera on a wheel drive.  Notice how exactly the operation was performed to replace the operator‚Äôs head with a camera ‚Äî there is almost no trace of interference.  This is not yet the T1000, rather the T1 - but progress is evident.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8a3/302/4d1/8a33024d14bbdd07de1cd575bfee5422.jpg"><br>  The younger fellows of the camera person rest and recharge after the performance.  I wonder if it is possible, according to their size, to classify it as child labor? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9d9/6a2/635/9d96a263579885db048f8b7c3d835d19.jpg"><br>  And here are flying drones.  Geksakopter hangs on the cables on the stand of the Radio Frequency Center, frightened by all his appearance.  There was no time to ask, but judging by the presence of a pigtail antenna, the device is not for entertainment, but for work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/722/be0/c97/722be0c97d0e2d6cde28965dd1e367a1.jpg"><br>  Robots injected, happy man.  Or so: the woman was taken out, the machine was set.  In short, the cunning owners of the stand project a picture with an aunt on the stencil, the aunt calls for a visit to the stand and praises the exploiters.  You can see, for example, at the Cisco booth (although it‚Äôs not the photo). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c46/1fc/9ce/c461fc9ce8c778c69cd8602d07f4fe83.jpg"><br>  Automation has penetrated here as well - instead of boring paper brochures on every second stand you can find a fashionable iPad gadget, carrying a mission to bring visitors to the information about the owners of the stand.  I wonder how many tablets fail at the end of the exhibition? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1a5/bdf/f5f/1a5bdff5ffa771d4b79c6ac912306ef4.jpg"><br>  Technique - on the technique and to break.  It is necessary for an adult uncle to throw everything and play in trains ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a35/84f/4fe/a3584f4fe01ebbd986e3419b2b563ca8.jpg"><br>  At Intel's stand, which represents fashionable ultrabooks, I was interested in this thing above, which has a keen eye that immediately recognizes the semblance of Kinect.  This controller of user movements is the fruit of one St. Petersburg company, and I was familiar with the person leading this project.  Igor, success in work, I am glad that so far everything is working out for you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/840/3fa/c7a/8403fac7a6e9ee3cad0aa4c1c5cc008d.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/188/710/032/188710032975f7b8be3eb3f3ae68feb3.jpg"><br>  The company "Ritall" presented an ethnon-design - a painted wardrobe.  Although the usual, classic rack-mount components, is also not paid attention. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/32c/968/4d7/32c9684d71f52bbe6e3f3531875bd409.jpg"><br>  Ritalla, both in the battle for customers and in the placement of stands, is opposed by AMP.  Yin and Yang are directly obtained, even in color.  Who are you for? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6e7/7a9/25a/6e77a925a68ec3c1af6bc7ed09ab3ced.jpg"><br>  And at the stand of MegaFon, no one is fighting, here trade is in full swing.  Chinese pieces of branded white and green colorings are sold, next to it - not in the photo - they sell souvenirs on the subject of the upcoming Olympiad in Sochi.  The MTS stand, as an antagonist, is located exactly opposite, but I was not particularly attracted by anything, did not even take pictures.  In sight, on the first day of the battle of the Titans will not be, trying on each other. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/52a/d07/a3a/52ad07a3af2cf88a4d42b84274765fb6.jpg"><br>  Rostelecom, by the way, also began selling equipment under its own brand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7d4/3c1/3a8/7d43c13a85fbed6b4a5449027b44b545.jpg"><br>  While the big players are butting in the main pavilions, stubborn Chinese are trying to seduce the domestic consumer in the back yard.  Dual SIM smartphone, IP67 compliant.  Behind, for comparing sizes - my Defy +.  The Chinese are obviously big. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/33b/853/59a/33b85359a13faf6cb4e7b065d7e9985e.jpg"><br>  But the tablet from other, more famous Chinese, was pleasantly pleased (although what I mean, the price is not indicated).  10 inches of honest IPS with FullHD, under which ICS sits, and all this - in a metal lightweight case.  It looks very decent, of the minuses - there is no USB, SD card and SIM slot.  IPad of some kind ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/325/a10/264/325a1026454eceae58d8dffe67c28bc7.jpg"><br>  But Telecore was originally noted - the stand tells of some alien intruders about the epic confrontation of the inhabitants of the Earth, which happens with the support of this company: she supposedly, on the day of the war, from the manufacturer of telecommunication equipment switches to manufacturing giant combat-like humanoid .  I'm not kidding, that's exactly the flight of fancy on their main stand, you see, they have fun working.  The photograph is one of the details of the future Voltron, in peacetime - a mobile data center. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/913/570/cf7/913570cf78650847470efe5b8860453d.jpg"><br>  If we are talking about the war - this is the terminal that is being proposed for the defenders of the country serving.  Remember, in the movie "Star Troopers" the main character of a similar device from the part of the parents talked?  The future is near.  By the way, there is also a terminal for correctional institutions on this stand, I can‚Äôt say what‚Äôs different from the military, it wasn‚Äôt. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0bd/d01/603/0bdd01603e795a981a3970a036a46c09.jpg"><br>  RIM is trying to push into the Russian market with its BlackBerry.  Personally, I am skeptical of them, although I heard a lot of rave reviews. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dec/e9e/e5c/dece9ee5c259e7941673b31be3cf36f6.jpg"><br>  Disney rushes into the mobile entertainment sector, enslaving immature children's minds with dull toys.  I also wanted to work on a comfortable ottoman with a joystick in my hands, but I was afraid of the queue for enslavement. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/076/38b/258/07638b258138b3b719693f3af17230c4.jpg"><br>  Instead, he taxied at the stand of AlmaMater - SPbGUT, he Bonch, where he allowed to conduct an experiment on the study of the resources of the body.  It looked like this: first, I put all the fingers in turn to the white box, then some tricky model of my energy field was built, and I was diagnosed with holes in this model: fast prostatitis and problems with blood circulation in the legs, This is about frequent headaches and problems with meniscus device silent.  Dr. House is clearly using the wrong methods, that's what's needed - a miracle device from Bonch.  Honestly, some kind of Vybegallovshchina. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4fe/ec6/173/4feec61738a8ed74d0fb1669402784b5.jpg"><br>  Intimidated by a miracle device, stumbled upon a transformed human-camera.  He threw off the wheels, grew his head, and fitted the camera onto a mechanical articulated arm, which stabilized all movements.  I remembered - it was on a similar bracket for video cameras during filming that the auto-forces of the special forces were fixed in the film ‚ÄúAliens‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3b0/acb/6ff/3b0acb6ff186bace1cf4ff373d873954.jpg"><br>  And on the street, between buildings, a whole autodrome with maps was launched.  I didn‚Äôt wait for a ride, but I admired the camera, flying at a furious speed over the track on four cables.  Now I know how to shoot such events. <br><br>  I also wanted to wander around - all the more so because some of the booths were invited to return for the sake of drawing prizes, but, alas, things were going, and in the evening it was time to go to St. Petersburg.  Of course, much remains behind the scenes - therefore, whoever has the opportunity and desire - I strongly recommend visiting the exhibition, it‚Äôs not a waste of time.  The exhibition runs until May 17, information, as always, on sviaz-expocomm.ru <br>  Enjoy your visit! <br><br>  <b>PS: I</b> <i>allow you to do anything with photos, if you need large sizes - please contact us.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143919/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143919/</a></p>
