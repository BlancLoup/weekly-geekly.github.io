Lettspley </h4><br><br>  Letspley - this is a video that shows the passing game.  Other applications in this way to promote difficult, although you can experiment with hybrids.  The summer play is published on behalf of the player and is always supplemented with comments.  As a rule, these comments have a rational and emotional component.  The player tells how to pass difficult levels, how to speed up the process of the game, where you can cheat a little to earn more points.  All this is presented fragmentary, because the person is completely immersed in the game.  The effect is ‚Äúadded‚Äù by emotions.  During the victory over the next monster, the player happily squeals, well, and generally accompanies the game process with hypertrophied reactions, which can often be correlated with the primary symptoms of neurological disorders.  But people like it. <br><br>  Why this nonsense gives the result? <br><br>  A friend shows you a new mobile game.  You are instantly involved in the process, you can watch for hours how he plays, and then suddenly take away his phone or tablet from him to try.  The gameplay is perceived as a movie, but at some point you realize that you yourself can participate in it. <br><br>  By the way about cinema: popular genres of flysplay correlate with popular film genres. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/87b/101/67f/87b10167f4e4415aaf0f057ce28b9687.jpg"><br><br>  The Internet is replete with live tapes recorded from desktop games, and they are already outdated.  Slowly gaining momentum mobile flysplyi.  The conversion after viewing is just awesome and reaches up to 50% of the settings from clicks, although in rare cases.  It is best to supplement the flysplay with a link and a button ‚ÄúDownload app‚Äù in the description. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/63o3hAaBmKg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiPYHsdpT3Jo8PY7XJsWde8qMy_Lg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/DZa05028eJA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi9vJ6fuS0uA0-qK6H_xmHnVX8NiQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  How to choose a flyer and how much it costs </h5><br>  To begin with - the results of the monitoring of the community of letplayshchikov (70,000 people). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/333/454/fe1/333454fe15bf460c9795fe753297e931.jpg"><br>  <i>The number of flyers by age</i> <br><br>  Most likely, a suitable candidate will be a schoolboy.  The prices on the market are different, they are dictated mainly by the level of the flyer's self-respect, but there is also an adequate high cost.  Short letplay from not too popular author will cost from 2000 rubles.  The long work requiring skill in the game itself can cost tens of thousands.  Some enthusiasts will make the play free of charge for the fact that you will open all levels personally for them.  The only correct (and it‚Äôs also the simplest) method of searching for the right person is a comparison of the ratings of the flysplays themselves. <br><br>  You can find a flyer in the same place where you post the video later.  Start with YouTube.  It is convenient to search in social networks, there are several communities that are issued on the inquiries of ‚Äúgame reviews‚Äù and ‚Äúletsplay‚Äù.  A good help in the search - forums on gaming topics and mobile app stores.  Among the reviews and posts you can find text reviews, which are quite simply converted into video, as a rule, inexpensively. <br><br><h4>  2. Video reviews </h4><br>  Reviews differ from letspleyev installation.  To create a video review, you also need to remove the gameplay, but after shooting the fragments are mounted into a kind of long trailer, which is voiced by the reviewer.  The video simply illustrates his words. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/0VByfum-h3w%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhj6eyMuGHUNzkayL9Qo4LN_PwboZA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The reviews are more systemic and target users of your application look at them, but at the same time they are deprived of the emotional component that is in the future, and cost more on average by 20%.  The choice between browsing and letting up depends on the type of application being promoted.  Plus reviews that can be used to promote not only the game. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/b1hFcKgqYZo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhbC3UbFa0OZvS7KwvlSkP6_E6O6A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/iU4-f2EIM5M%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgSDKjzfZH3AucYKP6T7fFugtBNDQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  On average, a YouTube user watches 6 hours of video per month.  The review is shorter, and it is easier for him to get into those 6 hours than to fly.  The share of mobile devices in the total viewing time for content on YouTube is almost 40%.  Another good news is that most reviewers are older than lecturers and have crossed the threshold of the allowed working age.  In addition, they are usually smarter and smarter because of the age and analytical essence of their product. <br><br>  An important point: when publishing reviews on social sites of an open type, it is necessary to work with comments.  Closing them is not worth it - a positive emotional charge of a comment often works better than any official call, but the same YouTube allows you to ban swearing users and set up a list of stop words. <br><br>  And now - case.  Company A. promotes the strategy game.  There is already a certain fame, there was a push campaign.  DAU 4000. Ordered two reviews and one letplay and posted it all on YouTube. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/74f/83e/90e/74f83e90e07c4ddc99d5f9de8c12c348.jpg"><br><br><h4>  3. Questions and answers, good advice </h4><br>  The method known - the publication of the necessary information in response to a user's question, asked the entire Internet.  Lead questions containing the name of your application, as well as questions on your subject, for example, "Which game to play on your mobile?" Or "Which taxi is best to call in Moscow?". <br><br>  It is important to naturalize the answers to such questions so that they are not "carried by the official", because advertising is prohibited. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/08a/370/e25/08a370e25b0347749a9ba333a02e4dbe.jpg"><br><br>  There are three positive points to this way of promotion. <br><br><ul><li>  Firstly, the cost of promotion is equal to the cost of the work of one person who will answer questions from different accounts. </li><li>  Secondly, such sites usually have a very high position in the issuance, and they will fall in the search results for your game.  This is good for building trust with new users. </li><li>  Thirdly, few people are engaged in this type of promotion. </li></ul><br><br>  Of course, there are downsides.  First of all, the search for questions takes a lot of time.  In addition, a lot depends on the application being promoted.  Well, it‚Äôs easy to pretend that you can end up with a big blow to your reputation. <br><br>  Where to find the right questions?  First, on the questions and answers services: ‚ÄúAnswers@Mail.ru‚Äù, ‚ÄúQuestions and Answers‚Äù ‚Äã‚ÄãGoogle, Quora.  The second step of the search is blogs on popular platforms: Yandex Blogs, Blogger.  A great option - reviews services, for example, Otzovik.ru.  Use the requests ‚Äúmobile game‚Äù, ‚Äúiphone game‚Äù, ‚Äúandroid game‚Äù, ‚Äúipad app‚Äù, etc. <br><br><h4>  4. Mocking advertising </h4><br>  Teaser ads, popanders and banners on torrents are gray promotion methods.  Does it affect their popularity?  Not.  No matter how they scold the teaser networks, they remain very popular and successfully bring clicks to sites due to the intriguing essence of advertising.  The teasers themselves have changed a lot: now they are not shocking pictures of tumors, but more or less adequate announcements, motivating to click and find out what the matter is.  Marketgid, Teasernet, BodyClick, Pay-click, Redtram, Recreativ and other networks responded to the transition of the market from pay-per-click to other models in a timely manner and deliver not the worst traffic. <br><br>  Popandera, clickandery and similar types of aggressive advertising work on the principle of "suddenly work out."  The advertising content is almost forcibly attached to the user, but due to targeted targeting, you can count on any result.  There are several services on the market that have long been making money on such traffic.  First of all, it is Popunder.ru and Propellerads.com. <br><br>  Advertising on trackers can be viewed as a separate type of promotion.  The advantage of torrents is huge traffic.  The downside is illegal content.  An advertiser may be held accountable for aiding piracy, however, we have not heard of such cases in Russia.  As a rule, advertising needs to be negotiated directly with the owners of the torrents directly.  A lot of traffic sells to Pirate Bay. <br><br>  For mobile marketing, the ability to customize ad displays targeted to mobile devices is of fundamental importance.  Traffic, which on the web is often considered junk, in mobile acquires a new potential - first of all, price.  Teasers are ineffective, but they are cheap ads.  No big conversion in the installation of these methods should not wait.  Sites-providers of traffic are accustomed to earn up to 0.003 dollars per click.  According to the local conversion, the CPI settings amount to 30 cents in the best (for the traffic seller) case.  This is three times lower than normal prices. <br><br>  If you need installs, you need to negotiate with suppliers for huge amounts of traffic and payment for the action.  If the traffic source allows you to experiment with device targeting, this must be done. <br><br>  <b>Who makes sense to work with teasing ads?</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Applications widespread.  Converting to installations is already low, targeting will significantly reduce the number of installations. </li><li>  Those who are interested in a scattered audience.  If you are not too important activity on payments, shearing, socialization of the application, your users are waiting for you on the trackers, in teaser and popandernyh networks. </li><li>  Those who do not have money for the healthy promotion of the application.  These methods are cheap, they do not require additional ideas, knowledge and skills.  The result is small but stable. </li><li>  Those who have money and time to experiment.  Sometimes miracles happen, and in the most unexpected places.  Perhaps the best channel to promote your application is exactly teasing advertising. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>How to work with such advertising</b> <br><br>  You need to choose networks and affiliate programs.  To negotiate directly is very difficult if it is not a torrent.  The rest of the market is distributed among the exchanges.  If you target an audience, you need to keep all targeting to a minimum.  If the network categorically does not work for CPI, you need to agree on a test period in order to check conversion of conversions into installations.  Insist on connecting your tracker that you trust.  If the conversion rate suits you, you can count the time for which you will order the promotion.  Typically, networks start dates from one week.  This makes sense, because the sites where your ad is located, drive huge traffic through banners to give you one installation.  User base burn out very quickly. <br><br>  <b>How to create an advertising message</b> <br><br>  It must be motivating.  The most motivating.  The audience is in advance inert, it must be provoked, and it should be done in such a way as to cause interest, not irritation.  The edge here is very thin, partly because of this, the effectiveness of teasers is so low.  There are three general rules: <br><br><ul><li>  The picture should be interesting and not frightening; </li><li>  The text should be short and suggesting a continuation with an explanation; </li><li>  According to the announcement, it should be clear what in principle is meant. </li></ul><br><br>  Let's try to create a banner layout for WhatsApp: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/703/b88/d42/703b88d428f94c73bb09fbeb1682b7d0.jpg"><br><br>  There is intrigue, birds are made up of logos.  More or less clear what advertising.  It does not frighten and causes interest. <br><br><h4>  5. Past publics </h4><br>  In social networks you can advertise through exchanges or directly under a contract with public.  The most effective way of advertising is posting useful materials in the community feed.  Usually for the publication of advertising are selected groups whose target audience corresponds to your application by sex, age, geography, wealth and interests.  If we exclude one or two filters from this set, we‚Äôll get an additional audience that your ad doesn‚Äôt get.  How likely is it that there is not a single person in this audience who will use your application? <br><br>  The search for additional audiences in social networks should start with past publics, focusing on communities for people who may be suitable for you on some additional thematic topic.  If it is simpler, non-thematic publics are the answer to the question ‚ÄúWho else can become our client?‚Äù.  This method of advertising is not suitable for everyone.  As a rule, past-publics give good results for applications of wide demand or at least a voluminous topic.  Narrow applications require targeted advertising. <br><br>  Against passing-publics, their inaccurate correspondence with your audience filters says.  Over - the comparative cheapness of advertising due to the fact that there are few competitive ads.  There is another very interesting effect, which makes it possible to put hope on past publics: advertising in an atypical place psychologically works much better than in usual and even ‚Äúworn out‚Äù places. <br><br>  <b>When does it make sense to work with past publics?</b> <br><br><ol><li>  If the target audience is exhausted; </li><li>  If you have the time and money to experiment; </li><li>  If you do not have money for popular ways of promotion.  This is a controversial economic move, but sometimes it works. </li></ol><br><br>  <b>How to find untargeted, but effective public</b> <br><br>  You must be sure that advertising in the past public is your option.  In most cases, it is much more convenient and more profitable to set up advertising through the VKontakte exchange for precise targeting, but if you have already counted and decided in favor of past publics, this checklist will be useful to you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ae/0de/47d/0ae0de47de8b4ca4a4128ef3c6ca25bc.jpg"><br><br>  All checklist answers must be positive.  The difference in prices in paragraph 1 should be noticeable.  In paragraph 2, you do not need to add anything to the general features, the list is exhaustive.  Detailed clarification requires the last two points. <br><br>  Paragraph 5 deals with the subject group of the product.  This means that the theme of your application is directly related to the group theme.  For example, a group about ordering a taxi and an application for ordering a taxi.  Banking group and banking application.  A group about magic and divination application.  Such a coincidence should not be.  Also, all groups about mobile apps and even just smartphones and web games are subject to restrictions.  This item is needed to exclude all groups where your competitors will be advertised. <br><br>  Paragraph 6 says about the thematic group of the product element.  The fact is that the public and the application cannot be left without communication at all, so it remains to play on the elements.  Examples of publicly selected by the element: <br><br><ul><li>  Candy Crash Saga - a group of lovers of sweets and sweets; </li><li>  Clash of Clans - a group about cold weapons; </li><li>  GetTaxi - group for party-goers; </li><li>  "KamaSutra" - a group about the problems in his personal life. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Case</b> <br><br>  Application - pregnancy calendar.  They calculated the cost: targeting on average was more expensive by 10 cents per impression, advertising in thematic groups is even more expensive and more dangerous, everywhere there are at least two competitors. <br><br>  We decided to pick up past publics for advertising.  Found three: a healthy diet, a group about needlework, a group about departed husbands. <br><br>  We share the results in comparison with the promotion in thematic groups.  Audience sizes can be neglected, they are similar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/20a/257/f32/20a257f32903488b96c0fefa550f4366.jpg"><br><br><h4>  6. Porn </h4><br>  From 15 to 30% of all mobile data traffic on the network is created by consumers of pornographic materials.  70% of the entire audience have an age of 18-24, which is very appetizing for broad applications.  The cost of advertising on porn sites is about 20 cents CPI. <br>  Configuring impressions should be done by geography, because porn sites usually have an audience of 10 or more states.  It is best to create creatives in different languages ‚Äã‚Äãand customize the shows based on the language.  Suppose that you have not been on porn sites and have not met with banners about dating in your city, where the city is written in Latin.  This is not comme il faut when Emily from Saratov does not mind meeting you.  There is a trick here, agree. <br><br>  Keep in mind that a user who is looking at your banner will not have time for him for some time.  Therefore, it makes sense to create non-annoying banners, pictures with intrigue, to keep at least the tip of the person‚Äôs attention. <br><br>  <b>Targeted themes of applications on porn sites</b> : <br><br><ul><li>  Intimate items; </li><li>  Dating; </li><li>  Means to increase potency. </li><li>  Topics with a high probability of success: </li><li>  Pickup; </li><li>  Food, drinks; </li><li>  Massage, relaxation services, spas; </li><li>  Cabaret and night clubs; </li><li>  Products and services to maintain physical fitness. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>How to advertise on porno?</b> <br><br>  Porn traffic can be bought on several services, it is sold among other topics.  Example: Trafficshop.com and Trafficholder.com.  At the time of purchase, you need to specify the theme of the sites and the traffic geography of interest.  There is no fundamental difference between the sites.  The audience on them is similar, differs only in territory. <br><br>  Sometimes with sites you can negotiate directly.  In this case, you have the ability to select pages for placement.  Perhaps your application somehow relates to a specific theme of the videos.  Then it makes sense.  It is necessary to publish banners on pages with a rating video, preferably in a rating category.  If the page does not play a special role for you, feel free to buy traffic on the services without any headaches. <br><br>  If you have direct agreements with porn sites, do not lose the opportunity to set up shows for the evening, when the audience significantly more.  Creating a banner, remember that the local audience has a special mood, so that the vulgar elements are very convertible.  It is best to place the video in the immediate vicinity of the video player window.  It is pointless to advertise on the main pages - the site user will be ready to pay attention to your offer only when he receives all the planned information. <br><br>  <b>Case</b> <br><br>  We promoted two apps using adult sites.  The first is a logic game based on pictographic riddles.  Advertised on Asian countries.  The main stream of users is men.  The average cost of the installation was 7 cents. <br><br>  The second application is dating, getting into the theme of the site.  Moved to Europe and Asia.  For a week, we collected the necessary amount of users with an installation cost of up to 20 cents.  Due to the large influx of men in the application, there was a slight imbalance, so the advertiser decided to conduct an additional campaign with a focus on women, but on other sites.  In the sum, the cost of attracting one client after two campaigns was 60 cents. <br><br><h4>  7. Spin-offs </h4><br>  Spin-off is an American term for product promotion.  Usually, spin-offs are called works of art that gain popularity due to the already existing popularity of another product similar to them.  At the hearing, spin-off series that develop the storyline of the main series in one narrow direction: for example, a separate series about one of the characters. <br><br>  In mobile marketing, spin-offs are designed primarily to reduce the cost of attracting a single client and increase the overall ARPU.  Spin-offs have the most popular games.  Angry Birds a few years ago got a game about pigs Bad Piggies and races Angry Birds Go.  In addition, Rovio released several products with double spin-off, when not only the birds themselves, but also famous artistic works gave their popularity: Angry Birds Star Wars, Angry Birds Rio, Angry Birds Transformers.  Fresh game - spin-off about Stella, pink bird. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d16/378/d2b/d16378d2b9064ca9a316df77e37aae65.jpg"><br><br>  King, who owns the Candy Crash Saga, has spin-offs with Soda Crush and some more similar products.  Interestingly, icons with links to similar games are built right into the application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e19/bc9/e38/e19bc9e38137498eab09b7a2a5321149.jpg"><br><br>  The most famous product with spin-offs is probably Talking Tom from Outfit7. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7af/6cc/17d/7af6cc17d09142da9b12d1b4a4a3702b.jpg"><br><br>  Spin-offs can be for applications of any type, not just games: for example, Kinopoisk has a ‚ÄúGuessKino!‚Äù Quiz where you need to determine a movie by frame. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a69/b40/f51/a69b40f5125b49fb85a0852641567f03.jpg"><br><br>  In games, there are often two types of spin-offs: prequels and midquels.  Sequels tell about the next adventures of the characters, in midkvels events develop parallel to the main storyline.  Any spin-off takes the user to the reality of the application, forming a three-dimensional perception.  Game spin-offs solve another important task - increase the time the user is in the application, which is why the revenue is growing.  Non-game spin-offs contribute to the spread of the brand, as in the case of Kinopoisk, where the advertiser will pay for the second application not the user. <br><br><h4>  8. Crossovers </h4><br>  A crossover in mobile marketing is an application that mixes events, characters, or locations from several other applications.  Due to the symbiosis of known objects, such applications quickly unwind themselves.  Digiplex.in created the unforgettable "2048", and neoGroup belongs to the arcade Flappy Bird.  A few months ago, DmWork launched the Flappy 2048 - Endless Combat crossover, combining two game mechanics in one application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bfd/018/0cc/bfd0180ccb254fcab0347156b19fcbca.jpg"><br><br>  Kiloo owns the running game Subway Surfers.  Gameloft takes the characters of the famous cartoon, minions, and launches his game - "Despicable Me." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/903/d98/fe6/903d98fe6d98437196ec9a070ef8d518.jpg"><br><br>  There is a whole series of applications based on popular films and cartoons.  Most of the costs of publishers in this case goes to the purchase of rights to use characters. <br><br><h4>  9. Combining applications </h4><br>  In popular games, there are often additional tasks in the form of mini-games.  In Talking Tom, to entertain the cat, you can scratch his tummy or play mini-games inside the main game.  Among the proposed mini-games: Flappy Tom (similar to Flappy Bird), Ball Shooter (similar to Zuma), Tower of Cakes (classic tower mechanics) and others built on popular tried and tested gameplay. <br><br>  Mini-games can be added to the main gameplay as "Easter eggs" or secret elements, and can be open and accessible at all times.  Their task is to expand the user's capabilities and increase the time spent in the application.  With an appropriate level of integration into the application, the user is easily involved in mini-games and shows interest in their originals.  In the same Talking Tom it is proposed to install other games for a coin, which are organically placed in the general list of mini-games. <br><br>  By agreement between the publishers, the player receives bonuses in the game about the cat, if he played the other game downloaded through it.  It would seem that the classic advertising in the mobile application for CPA, but in fact - a cleverly integrated offer with high demand. <br><br><h4>  10. Publisher substitution and co-branding </h4><br>  ZeptoLab, the developer of Cut the Rope, organized an interesting scheme of cooperation with small publishers.  The games are released under the general brand ZeptoLab, that is, the real developer voluntarily refuses to mention, for which the aggregator shares traffic with applications.  The brand advertised with the help of a frog attracts the attention of users, and they willingly install new proposed games.  ZeptoLab method of replacing the publisher gets a lot of different games and increases its own popularity, and small publishers have the opportunity to compete in a large market. <br><br>  Co-branding is the union of several brands to produce a common product.  Usually, small business units do this to instantly strengthen their positions and use this elevator to enter the market.  The strategy is good for small developers specializing in one topic.  Last summer, Alpina Publisher and iDeside jointly released Time Drive, based on the Gleb Arkhangelsky Diary (Russia's main time management specialist).  The diary itself was released in paper format, which was accompanied by a simplified time-drive application.  With the help of the developer, iDeside was able to significantly expand the functionality of the application.     ,   . <br><br><h4> 11.    </h4><br>      ‚Äî  .       .

If less is needed, conditions are discussed separately. The deadline for completing an order at the factory from the moment of payment to the moment the phones are delivered to the store can be up to six months.

But I ask you to understand what I am telling you about this tool only in the interests of the general awareness of Habr's readers and I want to share everything I know. <br><br>  Roughly speaking, this is spam in messengers.  I will tell you about how this works, but I do not advocate such a model.  As a user, he infuriates me no less than you. <br><br>  Most now use this tool absolutely stupidly, placing exactly between it and spam in the mail.  If you use it and then make it smarter.  How to work with him: <br><br>  For example: our audience is motorists. <br><br>  Work process: <br><br><ol><li>  We collect VKontakte groups dedicated to cars, with a general audience for example 3 million people. </li><li>  Then we parse ID's of all the subscribers of these groups. </li><li>  With the help of the script, we pull out the phones from these ID's. </li><li>  We get a huge base.  Load it in the mailing base. </li><li>  We make targeted advertising. </li></ol><br><br><h5>  How to target such advertising </h5><br>  In our case (TSA Motorists) we can write something like ‚ÄúGood afternoon!  We made the application ‚ÄúAnti-radar‚Äù - it will help you to see traffic police posts on your application.  Download the link: ... ‚Äù <br><br>  Here is a message that will have a much higher conversion than stupid spam with flowers, refrigerators and other things.  CTR will be low.  But due to the large volume you can get a large number of installations. <br><br>  Another option - focus on holidays or events.  For example, before the start of the Champions League, you can gather football fans and make a newsletter ‚ÄúAppendix: the calendar of matches of the Champions League.  Download for free. ‚Äù <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  As a result: there are a lot of tools for promoting the application, and using them correctly, you can get a large number of installations with minimal marketing costs. <br><br>  I hope this article was useful for you.  I propose to continue the discussion in the comments: share your opinions, comments, and even better, your own cases. <br><br>  The best thanks for the work done will be ‚Äúlike‚Äù and repost this article. <br><br>  Also, if you are interested in the topic of application promotion, a <a href="http://appbrain.ru/seminar/">free 4-hour seminar</a> takes place in Moscow on March 25th. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/279933/">https://habr.com/ru/post/279933/</a></p>
