  <section class="page js-page"><h1>REDMOND Multibaker: 25 in 1 Multi Baker for Baking Lovers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The international brand REDMOND stands out because it boldly produces unusual devices.  And in terms of functions, and in terms of design.  Perhaps the most striking innovation of REDMOND is the Smart Home line with a large assortment of household appliances (from multi-cookers to heaters) controlled from smartphones and via the Internet.  But today we will talk about the device easier.  It is not remotely controlled, but its capabilities are surprising.  We introduce you to <a href="http://redmond.company/ru/lp_multibaker/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes">REDMOND Multibaker</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/abd/ea2/3a0/abdea23a01524e28a42c4764d9db2708.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Technical characteristics of REDMOND MultiBaker M604:</b>

      Power: 700 W <br>  Voltage: 220-240 V, 50 Hz <br>  Light indicators: heating, work status <br>  Dimensions: 236 x 236 x 101 mm <br>  Weight: 1.99 kg <br>  Complete set: multipekar, three replaceable panels, instruction, warranty card, recipe book <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a3/573/501/3a35735012024ec48f7797adcd88e9f2.jpg"><br><br>  If you simplify to the limit, then we have a very powerful electric waffle iron.  But waffles are not all that she can.  A multi Baker is a ‚Äú25 in 1‚Äù class device, no matter how loud it sounds. <br><br>  Outwardly, this is really the usual waffle iron.  But inside - removable panels with non-stick coating.  They are suitable for frying (grilling) and baking different dishes.  Each panel has its own relief, so you can cook not only waffles (several types - Viennese, Belgian, etc.), but also nuts with condensed milk, pretzels and pretzels, shortbread, gingerbread houses ... Including cookies of any shape - with letters, numbers, in the form of little men and so on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a89/919/d24/a89919d24dfd4f348c84b0e141efa9e3.jpg"><br><br>  Do not want sweet?  Multi Baker will help you quickly make a closed pie with omelette, scrambled eggs, pancakes, sandwiches, pizza, nuggets, even grilled meat or fish!  Moreover, for complete readiness of the steak, it takes 10-15 minutes, and baking takes 3-5 minutes.  No need to bother in advance and you can cook right before the arrival of guests.  And still it will not burn anything, there is no need to constantly monitor (like an oven or a frying pan), turn over the ‚Äústuffing‚Äù. <br><br>  The device will certainly appeal to those who have ‚Äúhands from the wrong place‚Äù in relation to cooking.  After all, do not worry about searching for recipes, everything has already been invented and step by step is written for you by experienced chefs who cooperate with REDMOND.  But if you are an ‚Äúartist‚Äù of cooking, nothing will prevent you from experimenting with recipes and ingredients. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b5/27f/78a/9b527f78a88b479d8aca4b763b6cf733.jpg"><br><br>  A colorful recipe book comes with Multi Baker included.  And then there is the ‚ÄúCooking with REDMOND‚Äù <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/redmond/id1045059258">app</a> on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/redmond/id1045059258">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.redmond">Android</a> , instructions for cooking ‚Äúsnacks‚Äù are added there regularly. <br><br>  Just do not say, "But I still feel too lazy with this, now you can buy anything you like!"  You can buy something, but, firstly, the prices are often - hoo.  And even if it does not "float" you, think about the composition.  Preservatives, stabilizers, flavor enhancers, palm oil and all that stuff.  When you prepare for yourself, then you are responsible for the usefulness of the products.  By the way, it is not necessary to add oil on the Multipekar's panels; nothing burns on them, thanks to the special coating. <br><br>  And remember about allergies.  On packages with baking, it is often stated that during production, particles of milk or nuts can get into the product, even if the final product according to the recipe should not contain them.  Again, it is safer to bake yourself.  And with REDMOND Multi Baker, this is easy. <br><br>  In addition, with Multi Baker, you do not need to keep dozens of different devices in the kitchen - for waffles, for nuts, for donuts, for sandwiches, for grilling, for omelettes.  With all one small Multipekar copes.  The device is compact, folds the "book" and does not take up extra space. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ded/906/847/ded906847fb14efbbe8e028c66301e31.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c6a/98d/788/c6a98d788ed345a1a0221641f6ba441e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/911/f2a/3ef/911f2a3efac7472aaf47d18805b6c6d0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ec/c11/0d6/0ecc110d65f943b784e41fed075c429c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/830/d97/ae9/830d97ae99c442cfae128e69e737cf91.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b9b/5c5/30b/b9b5c530bc384a91919e68105778da3c.jpg"><br><br>  REDMOND Multipekar for 5+ is assembled, nothing is loose after several months of use.  The surface of the device is non-marking, quickly cleared.  In the closed state, the device is clearly fixed by a latch on the handle.  On the top panel there are two indicators - operation and heating.  When you turn on the device in the network, the red light will turn on, will soon change to green - this means that you can start baking / frying.  During cooking, the red light (heating) will turn on periodically. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/050/8a5/b20/0508a5b20753454e9f92925c0b4262eb.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/37f/cd0/c8d/37fcd0c8d71849229a28289445ec702a.jpg"><br><br>  Replaceable panels with non-stick coating securely hold on the clamps, easily removable.  Wash too easily - thanks to all the same special non-stick coating. <br><br>  To prepare the selected dish, you need to install the necessary panels, fill them with stuffing (make sure that it does not ‚Äúget out‚Äù behind the edges), close the appliance until it clicks and wait for the time indicated in the recipe. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0d9/d4f/552/0d9d4f552e2540d0b1ff82fdf465b49d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e80/931/acb/e80931acbc5b480591f61788b05f36cd.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5a5/265/159/5a5265159a514d4f9eb18f3f7ce7f6ee.jpg"><br><br>  For those who have few photos and need a video demonstration, here is a video recipe for cooking divine cheese pretzels from REDMOND: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RS61ui9WJ8A" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  And here - excellent low-calorie waffles (without butter), for fans of proper nutrition: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iES5SdHYiEo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  About trim levels and prices.  At the moment, 25 pairs of panels are available.  But, as usual, all at once with the purchase does not get.  There are several modifications of the device, each with three pairs of panels in the kit (such a set costs 2,990 rubles) + an option with six panels and an option with ten panels.  And the rest of the "insert" can be purchased independently <a href="http://redmond.company/ru/lp_multibaker/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes">on the website REDMOND</a> , each will cost 995 rubles.  Buy a removable panel for a universal device easier and more profitable than a separate kitchen device. <br><br>  <b>Modifications of REDMOND Multipekar:</b> <br><br>  1. RMB-M611 / M601 with panels for Viennese waffles, sandwiches and grills. <br>  2. RMB-M602 with grill panels, pretzels / pretzels and thin waffles. <br>  3. RMB-M603 with sandwich panels, Viennese waffles and nuggets / petit fours. <br>  4. RMB-M604 with grill panels, Viennese waffles and mini pretzels. <br>  5. RMB-M606 with panels for Viennese waffles, grill, pretzels / pretzels. <br>  6. RMB-M607 for 5,495 rubles with 6 panels included - for sandwiches, Viennese waffles, donuts, Belgian waffles, grill, pizza and closed pies. <br>  7. Iii ... fresh special offer - A multi-baker and a set of 10 interchangeable inserts to choose <a href="https//multivarka.pro/lp_multipekarnya/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes">from at a discount of 20%</a> .  All together - for 7 990 rubles. <br>  You can see the entire current range <a href="http://multivarka.pro/spb/catalog/multipekar/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes">on the company's website</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e6c/cc0/913/e6ccc0913dff4904bb0c6f010c565817.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, using home appliances REDMOND can simplify the process of cooking even more.  In the introduction, we said that the company stands out with interesting devices, here's another, which has no analogues, - REDMOND multi-kitchen.  This is not just a multicooker, but also a convection oven and a rising hob with a frying pan included.  The device supports a variety of manual and automatic cooking programs that are available for both ‚Äúmultivark‚Äù mode and pull-out heating surface.  With such a device, if necessary, you can generally do without a stove (convenient for students in apartments with micro-kitchens). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d30/589/53a/d3058953aff84ce0bb4b60432d0c8922.jpg"><br><br>  And why are we talking about this?  Besides that, the popular Multikukhon RMK-M451 and RMK-M271 models can be bought complete with the Multi Baker and get an excellent discount.  All together called Home Chef.  <a href="http://multivarka.pro/catalog/multikitchen/domashniy_shef_povar_redmond_rhc_m27104/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes">Modification of RHC-M27104</a> <br>  It is offered for 7,295 rubles (only the RMK-M271 multi-kitchen will cost 5,995 rubles separately, and the Multi-Baker, I remind you, costs 2,900 rubles).  <a href="http://multivarka.pro/catalog/multikitchen/domashniy_shef_povar_redmond_rhc_m45104_chernyy/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes">REDMOND RHC-M45104 is</a> offered for 8,295 rubles (a more powerful model with a more interesting design).  The devices are boiled, fried, stewed, baked, and in the end - you can boil water for tea or boil coffee in the Turk.  And the number of recipes is already difficult to calculate (including yogurt, cheese, bread, fondue, and so on). <br><br>  Summing up, let's say that Multipekar is a great assistant in the kitchen for any family (and for those who have not yet got a family, too).  And a great gift for any occasion.  The device is convenient and easy to use, cooks in 5-10 minutes, offers dozens of simple recipes (both sweet pastries and savory breakfasts / lunches / dinners).  The device is sure to please even those who are not fan of cooking.  Those who want to make their lives as easy as possible should take a closer look at the ‚Äúheavy artillery‚Äù in the form of the multi-functional REDMOND Multicooking.  The ‚ÄúHome Chef‚Äù set will replace most kitchen appliances and allow you to cook, without exaggeration, hundreds of different dishes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/401739/">https://habr.com/ru/post/401739/</a></p>
