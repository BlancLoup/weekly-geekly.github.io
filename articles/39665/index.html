  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How is sports content mined</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Leading technical.ru to <a href="http://www.sports.ru/">Sports.ru</a> , I never climb into the editorial kitchen.  Humanitarian affairs bypass me because of the division of labor in the company, and I am not a sports journalist.  I know that materials, news, photos are uploaded to the database through the editorial interface, but I don‚Äôt understand how the content is formed before it appears on the site.  The editorial staff constantly speak on the phone, sit on the Internet, go to matches, discuss the topics of the day at lunch, hold briefings, meeting meetings, brainstorming sessions, rallies ... Not that I would like to try myself as a correspondent. Something journalistic "zavarushke." <br>  On Wednesday, when <a href="http://www.sports.ru/stat/match/preview/16455.html">the Russian national team was hosting the Wales national team</a> , the editorial office revealed an extra accreditation for the match, which I decided to use for its intended purpose.  A strong desire to sit on football in ‚Äúpressuh‚Äù and simply diversify my evening prompted me to get into <a href="http://www.sports.ru/profile/3070276">Vanya Kalashnikov‚Äôs</a> fridge: armed with a press card, a Bosco olympic shirt and a flip camera, I went to Lokomotiv stadium as part of the Sports.ru team of journalists. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We get to the stadium by metro: the cars and stations of the Sokolnicheskaya line are crammed with fans with flags and "dudelokami", "white collars" in scarves of national colors, painted in tricolor by children.  The stadium is cordoned off by spiraling police cordons, the roar of fans is already starting to shake the air.  We pass by the girls selling flags and scarves, by the grandfather, pushing "Semki" fans for 50 rubles each.  Past the central entrance, decorated with metal detector frames and closet riot policemen.  For VIPs and journalists a separate entrance is organized, where you present a membership card and calmly pass.  Bags do not check, jackets do not feel: you can safely carry a bottle of good konyak, salami and a knife for cutting. <br><br>  Entrance to the press box through a separate gate between the south and east stands.  Stadium staff once again check the accreditation, pass.  Immediately heading to the press center - the other to see and be seen.  At the entrance to the room below the stands, they check the press card again.  The press center is filled with journalists of all stripes: photo correspondents, TV reporters, people from newspapers / magazines, representatives of websites;  Muscovites, provincials, foreigners.  Photographers are exposed in bright red clothes of tracklayers, videographers flaunt in bright yellow vests, the rest of the dress code is determined by the weather: outside the window there is a piercing wind and drizzling rain.  Inna pokes a finger at a young man with a glamorous hairstyle and informs me that this is a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport">Guardian</a> journalist.  The Englishman is clearly embarrassed, he rubs the ticket in his hands and tries to look in the crowd for a familiar face. <br><br>  In the press center there are LCD TVs on the walls (on the first is a raw video stream, on the second is the official TV broadcast, on the third is Eurosport), journalists sit at the tables with laptops (the stadium is equipped with publicly available WiFi points).  Nearby is an interview room littered with television equipment.  There is also a small cafeteria (only Carlsberg is on the menu), a toilet and a place for smoking - in general, there is everything for the normal work of a journalist.

      We go up to the press box, check the documents again near the stairs - we should hang the press card on the neck.  Places are excellent, you can see everything in full view.  A year ago, I was in the VIP box on the western stand (Lokomotiv-Zenit match) could not see the player numbers.  And here they can almost feel.  The stadium is packed to capacity, there are no empty seats.  Next to our lodge were located fans of Wales, about 100 people.  During the match, I practically did not hear them, they occasionally shouted three-time ‚Äúuuu-uh,‚Äù trying to chant the name of their country, but our ‚ÄúNext, Russia!‚Äù Immediately interrupted the Welsh cry. <br><br>  In the box did not see a single familiar person, except for <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B8%25D1%2585%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB_%25D0%25A8%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586">Michael Schatz</a> .  Apparently, just like me, I decided to press out into ‚Äúpressuha‚Äù and watch live football from ‚Äútrump‚Äù places.  The game began quietly, the English-speaking neighbor took out his binoculars and began to look at the numbers on the backs of the players.  Yuto envied, tk.  I left my optics at home - I use glasses only when I drive, and I only drive when I don't drink.  He took a sip of beer from a plastic cup and looked at the compositions obtained in the press center.  It turned out that I know everyone in the Russian team, nobody in the Wales team. <br><br>  By the middle of the first half, large drops began to fall from the canopy of the stadium.  The neighbor was flooded with a laptop, and he retired to the room below the stands.  Press box covered with umbrellas, and charged rain.  1: 0, Pavlyuchenko scores from the penalty spot.  The press (its Russian part) jumps up with the fans.  The first half ends under fanfare already raging rain. <br><br>  Moving to the press center to warm up: foreigners are laying out laptops, Russian-speaking people go to the cafeteria to drink tea and "that is stronger."  We look at the replays of the moments on the screens, discuss whether <a href="http://www.sports.ru/tags/5684384.html">Hennessy</a> touched the ball when he tried to parry the penalty.  Defend a long queue in the cafeteria, take tea / beer and go back to the box.  The press significantly thinned: the Europeans remained in the room, the Russians crawled out into the fresh air, climbed under the umbrellas and began to curse loudly.  The reason for indignation was the first 15 minutes of the second half, during which the Russian team frankly fails in defense and gets a deserved 1: 1 on the scoreboard.  <a href="http://www.sports.ru/tags/5628622.html">Ledley</a> scores in a well-played combination. <br><br>  By the end of the second half, the weather calmed down, unlike the Russian fans, who have become even more fiercely to whip up the national team.  ‚ÄúNeed a goal!  Need a goal!  Substitute Pogrebnyak justifies the coach's trust - 2: 1.  The Welsh are trying to conduct a couple of aggressive attacks, but to no avail.  At the end of the second half, Hiddink is not allowed to play to keep the account: Bystrov, who replaced, does not have time to run ten meters.  Whistle, the Russian national team +3. <br><br>  At the end of the match, <a href="http://www.sports.ru/profile/4303242/">Inna</a> contracted me in the mixed zone to videotap anyone who moves - I‚Äôm working on the opportunity to watch live football.  Moreover, it became interesting that such a mixed zone.  It turned out that it was a waiting room between the exit from the locker room and the exit to the street.  Journalists gather in the mixed zone and try to get answers to questions from the participants of the match leaving the complex.  There are many cameramen with cameras, correspondents, photographers in the room.  Everyone wants to get their exclusive.  Chief in the group of the first channel is trying to find out from the operator, where did the light go.  Sport TV channel brought a professional in a shirt and tie that stands out in a casual-style crowd of journalists. <br><br>  Our collections run out into the street, not paying attention to journalists, something like this: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sk_aiOVc2Hs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Akinfeev, Semak ( <a href="http://www.sports.ru/profile/2788828">Matveyev</a> in fear: "Do not stop him! Otherwise we will decrypt the interview until the morning!"), Pavlyuchenko, Arshavin ... Everyone rushes by photo and video cameras, journalists are indignant: "The first match of the national team in the qualifying round, and no one does not want to say anything!  Semshov stops, journalists meet him approving hooted.  Later, the Welsh run out, immediately approach their ‚Äúown‚Äù journalists, talk, answer questions.  Do not overlook and ours.  Civilized people.  They behave pleasantly, without negativity, they smile, however, everyone says the same thing: ‚ÄúAt the beginning of the game I thought we would win,‚Äù ‚ÄúA little was not enough,‚Äù ‚ÄúLet's take revenge at home.‚Äù <br><br>  Having jumped, shooting a video, I go out into the street.  The stadium is empty, terribly dark, around no one.  There is no power left to go by metro: I catch a car.  Wet, tired, but satisfied with the food going home, sorting out plans for a month and doing my own technical work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/39665/">https://habr.com/ru/post/39665/</a></p>
