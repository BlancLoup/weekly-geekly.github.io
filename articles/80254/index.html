  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tv Test results</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this topic I want to summarize the previous <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/study/80158/">test</a> . <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/e8/ed/e0/2435362/0/test1.jpg" alt="Tv test"><br><br>  As expected, the vast majority of people who do not watch TV have the ability to completely replace it (news, any cognitive information, music, movies, and other video).  Almost 20% are categorically against it, 15% do not watch it without high-speed Internet access and 4% are watching, perhaps because there is no fast Internet.  But the most interesting, noted 137 people (18%), who watch TV, and they have a good channel on the Internet.  Some of them, perhaps, mean cable / satellite TV (I have nothing against him), but probably not all.  That is, we can conclude that there are people in whose lives TV still takes some place.

      Under habrakatom the purpose of this post and create a survey. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Now the background, why I created this survey.  It all started with the appearance of my first Internet, the TV died as a source of almost any information.  Not much time has passed, the zomboyaschik only occasionally got into the zone of attention.  A few days ago, it so happened that for about an hour I randomly clicked on the buttons of the console.  It seems that all the New Year holidays broadcast was occupied for the most part by marasmic shows and silly films, which are often saturated with a fair amount of vulgarity.  Open the program schedule and you will understand what I mean.  And this is only one hour of one evening. <br>  For myself, I concluded that now I can be more critical of TV.  A few years ago I looked and it seemed to me that everything was quite interesting.  I spent hours behind him then and justified it with the acquisition of new knowledge and even the study of the world (!).  Fortunately, this drug was not so strong and let go, leaving for some time after itself only a habit during breakfast to turn it on to the background. <br>  On Habr√© there was already a lot of topics about the fact that only we ourselves can force ourselves to do / not do something, develop and don‚Äôt have to wait for help or a magic Pendel from anywhere.  Of course, you are right, but what if you want to change something in a person close to you?  Here you will not say that only he himself must understand and correct. <br>  My wife watched Dom2 almost a while ago.  I tried to prohibit, turn off, set conditions, but with one always the result: we quarreled, dispersed to different rooms and she continued to look.  The whip method did not work here, and the reason is simple: TV took a lot of time in her (and my life before), he organically woven into everyday life, diluting it.  If you simply exclude it, you get an emptiness that needs to be filled with something.  That's what I did: I began to tell interesting facts, show photos, videos, interested her as I could, introduced to the world of blogs.  And in the end, good again defeated evil - the TV strongly surrendered positions, although it did not go away completely.  Perhaps, I changed the task: it was necessary not to drag off the Internet, but to exclude the TV, but I do not think that I made it worse.  The gingerbread method worked. <br>  But this approach had no effect on the old generation.  My attempts did not change the situation. <br><br>  Well, actually, the purpose of the topic: tell me, how do you solve the problem of households and TV?  Especially interested in the opinion of parents who are faced with this problem.  Sooner or later, and I will have kids, how to protect the child from the influence of this monster? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/80254/">https://habr.com/ru/post/80254/</a></p>
