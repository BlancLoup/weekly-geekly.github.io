  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Gearbest checked: rumors about women are greatly exaggerated</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Remember the pain of Mel Gibson in the film ‚ÄúWhat do women want?‚Äù - he did hair removal, painted his nails, and walked in tights, and most importantly he understood only at the very end.  Such a risk seemed unreasonable to us, so we created a holiday section and decided to experiment a bit.  As it should be, we give a teaser before the kata: golden iPhones and epilators are not in favor, no one chose another bauble and did not demand Bugatti (well, actually, it wasn‚Äôt in the catalog).  We also did not encounter epic feminine logic - not a single man was hurt during the survey. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ee9/bd6/3e0/ee9bd63e06e65bb337aa65ea910f17ef.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We decided in principle not to dedicate the post to <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/promotion-8-special-1214.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">gifts by March 8</a> (you must admit that it was too late to rush about), but to dedicate it to March 8 itself.  To do this, we collected the female part of the Gearbest team and asked to choose from the <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/promotion-8-special-1214.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">holiday catalog</a> what they would like to have in their home, in the kitchen, in their purse.  I must say, the experiment turned out to be interesting - it turns out, in addition to the banal heaped smartphones flagships, girls need quite mundane things.  And the best part is those who create not their personal comfort, but coziness and beauty in the house.  Surprisingly, we saw a couple of completely atypical geeky things among the answers (the men did not even suspect that this is extremely important in the economy and generally exists) - about them in the end. <br><br><h2>  Business lady </h2><br>  They are easy to recognize - they walk quickly, think with concentration and try to do everything at once: to work for themselves and their lazy colleague, correct the mistakes of their subordinates, check the lessons for children, dictate to their parents in an authoritative tone what medicines and what time they need to drink.  And in the evening, they look tiredly at their loved one and lean their heavy head against his forehead or shoulder ‚Äî and become more vulnerable than anyone else.  In their life there is always a place for functional and almost unkillable gadgets.

You can look at the golden <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/tablet-pcs/pp_268666.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">Xiaomi Mi Pad 2</a> with a 7.9-inch Retina-display, running the Intel Atom Z8500 X5 processor (pulls almost all games) and the Android 5.1 operating system.

This option is suitable for both a business woman and a young mother, who needs to distract her children (or herself) at least with something, and for a student.

But not so big to lose in it. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4c9/359/9bf/4c93599bf3f315a87977ecb90db3f3ab.jpg"></div><br>  For those who do not have enough capacious batteries listed gadgets, there are power banks.  <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/power-banks/pp_492337.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">Xiaomi</a> 10000 mAh ultra-thin silver <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/power-banks/pp_492337.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">external battery</a> in an aluminum case is a good companion for girls who often go on business trips or simply prefer to stay connected at any time.

The device has touch controls, supports work with a smartphone via Bluetooth: you can change the brightness, select the backlight color from 16 million RGB colors, set timers, etc.  You can customize the automatic color change, and this is a very cool feature: if you try to experiment carefully and honestly with the light for a month, you will notice how much more pleasant the process of waking up will be even the earliest early.  Our body is very sensitive to color and light, so the lamp will help to adjust the biorhythms.  The service life is 20,000 hours, the night lamp is compatible with Apple iOS 7.1, iPod touch 5 and Android 4.3 or higher.

But living with such people is very cool and not boring: they will not build Turgenev girls out of themselves, flinch and blush from one single scabrous word in the film, and will gladly laugh at you with a black comedy or a thin IT joke on the Internet (and not too thin ).  These girls will not give up gifts with a joke.  Carefully - everything that you donate can be used against you. <br><br>  <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/speakers/pp_466685.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">The mini Bluetooth speaker is</a> reminiscent of the hero ‚ÄúThe Secret Life of Pets‚Äù and is able to please even an adult girl.

However, in this case, worry more than ever justified. <br><br>  In our houses there are a lot of upholstered furniture, carpets, sometimes there are at least soft toys and fluffy animals, which intensively lick their beautiful skins, and then itching unceremoniously and dust off.  All this dust, particles of skin, wool, hair and saliva fly in the air of our apartments, which are also tightly corked from October to April.

Of course, in our zones of risky farming at dachas, such a device can be overworked, but for home plants in pots and growing seedlings is the first necessity.

It‚Äôs convenient to do makeup and wear contact lenses.  The most important thing in the mirror is the backlight: on the one hand, the device can serve as a night lamp on the dressing table, and on the other, you can turn on the backlight of the mirror part itself.  This allows you to see the face in the smallest detail.  Even a leg with curved edges is surprising - you would know how convenient it is when round pencils, tubes of lipstick and mascara do not roll down on the floor, collecting dust there, but lie quietly at hand.  According to the action, it will cost $ 38.89 - almost at the level of ordinary cosmetic mirrors from perfume shops.  In spite of its lack of quality, it is a very pleasant and useful gift, which is almost impossible to miss. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/makeup-brushes-tools/pp_298980.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/13a/54b/37b/13a54b37bdd15fb76a2a0fdb5bba5780.jpg"></a> </div><br>  Such a variation turned out to be different, just like the girls themselves: geeks and not so much, economists and designers, programmers and engineers, secretaries and managers.
