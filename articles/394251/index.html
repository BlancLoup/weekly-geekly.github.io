  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dell XPS 12: When not to choose between a laptop and a tablet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Sales of devices of type 2-in-1, that is, combining the qualities of a tablet and a laptop, grow year by year.  In 2015, more than 42 million such harvesters were sold worldwide.  The reasons for growth are clear: to have on hand both that and the other for one price is really tempting.  But the definition of a class of 2-in-1 devices is still very blurry.  Under the guise of it can be sold and the most ordinary laptop, whose lid is rotated 180 degrees, and a simple tablet with a keyboard, literally painted on a rag. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/857/71c/499/85771c499d34471394fa8ec9f1ad26a3.jpg"><br><br>  The new Dell XPS 12 was designed so that both entities have functionality no worse than that of just a laptop and just a tablet.  The task, frankly, is not simple: a detachable screen usually forces you to transfer too many components to it, and this at least upsets the balance of the system.  But Dell engineers managed to solve it with the lowest possible tradeoffs.  And the majority of users will not even notice them. <a name="habracut"></a>

      It so happened that the Dell XPS 12 came to me to study without prior virtual acquaintance.  I usually go to the Dell site, look at the reviews on Amazon and Best Buy, but there were several business trips here, and, frankly, there was nothing to it.  I just knew that a new interesting product, and which one, remained behind the scenes.  And when the time came, I unpacked the box - quite small, thinner than the iPad - and for the first five minutes I was sure that I was dealing with a compact ultrabook.  Some doubts arose when, after looking more closely at the interface between the keyboard and the screen, I pulled the last one harder - and it remained in my hands. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/07d/28a/08e/07d28a08e3df4ff5b47f93e9f9add60e.jpg"><br><br>  Seriously, the design is brilliant.  When folded at all, you will not understand that the top cover comes unfastened.  This is hinted at by an angular protrusion at the junction of the keyboard and the main unit with the screen, but it can be mistaken for a designer stand.  Moreover, when you raise the screen - it floats quite smoothly and reliably on magnets.  So at this stage it did not occur to me that I was dealing with 2-in-1.  When opened, the Dell XPS 12 can be worn at the keyboard and behind the screen.  Magnets are strong, nothing will fall off. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3e6/6fc/ca1/3e66fcca18524607a408408765be7601.jpg"><br><br>  But we make a small effort - and only the tablet remains in the hands.  Not a feather, 790 grams.  But in the case 8 mm thick the stuffing of the real personal computer with a decent set of interfaces fits.  And just a great screen. <br><br>  Let's talk about the configuration in more detail.  I must say that one of the top versions came into my hands, but there are simpler options, I will write about them at the end. <br><br>  <b>Iron</b> <br><br>  As you might guess from the name, the screen of the Dell XPS 12 has a diagonal of 12, or rather 12.5 inches.  The resolution is 3840 x 2160 pixels, or, if you use terminology from the world of TVs, 4K Ultra HD.  The clarity, as you might guess, is beyond the limit ‚Äì‚Äì 352 dots per inch with a 100 percent coverage of the RGB palette.  The screen is really very good.  Operating Windows 10 has learned to use high resolution wisely, so the objects are not just small, but very clear.  The viewing angle of the IPS IGZO matrix approaches 180 degrees.  At least, even looking at the picture completely from the side, I did not notice any distortion of shades.  This is especially useful given the diagonal of the screen: if you have to look at it collectively, do not have to face their heads in search of a comfortable point of view. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ef/ed4/8c4/7efed48c43f241afb3968707ae2226c8.jpg"><br><br>  The case material is a soft touch magnesium alloy.  The screen is protected by Gorilla Glass NBT - it is a special coating designed for tablets and laptops that saves the surface from scratches.  The tablet part is made just like a real tablet.  I am pretty cleverly disassembling laptops and tablets on x86 architecture, and here, I confess, I failed.  Details are very close to each other, and I was just afraid to look for secret latches, for fear of damaging the edges. <br><br>  And since this is a real tablet, it does not have active cooling.  Yes, no propellers.  He grabs the radiator, which is played by the entire back of the screen.  This is possible thanks to the Intel Core m5-6Y57 processor.  He has a heat pack of only 4.5 W, and two cores with a standard frequency of 1.1 GHz (Hyper Threading support) and the ability to accelerate under load to 2.8 GHz were put in there.  I know about mass prejudices about the performance of Core m, but I myself tried the first generation in different systems, and personally I just had enough.  Although it is difficult to call me an undemanding user: for example, processing photos in RAW a hundred in the evening is a typical task for me.  The new generation Core m, which, it seems, was called the sixth for uniformity (in fact, it is the second), it has no performance problems at all.  In real-world applications, the Core m5-6Y57 is abundant.  Not disappointing and the graphics core Intel HD Graphics 515, for which the resolution of 4K is not any difficulty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ce/670/69c/1ce67069cefc4ad294382847395c5780.jpg"><br><br>  If we closely look at the characteristics of the sixth-generation Mobile Core i5 and Core m, we find a slightly lower memory bandwidth in Core m, which is more than offset by the ‚Äúextra‚Äù megabyte of Smart Cache.  There is an opinion that in everyday tasks a cache will be more useful. <br><br>  And just for comparison.  In the benchmark WinRar Intel Core m5-6Y57 knocks 2813 points, and Core i5-5200U, with twice the base frequency, only 2405. So decide - who is faster. <br><br>  The good news is that the minimum memory capacity of the XPS 12 is 8 GB.  But it so happened that it is also the maximum.  The processor itself can address up to 32 GB, but in such a compact package (remember about 8 mm) it is difficult to find a place for another 4-8 chips.  On the other hand, 8 GB is the best option for a mobile PC, for my needs I buy equipment with such volume. <br><br>  The storage capacity in my copy of the Dell XPS is 12,256 GB, but it can vary from 128 GB to 512. The performance of my Samsung SSD pleased me. <br><br>  <i>Sequential Read (Q = 32, T = 1): 534.072 MB / s</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Sequential Write (Q = 32, T = 1): 304.942 MB / s</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Random Read 4KiB (Q = 32, T = 1): 207.224 MB / s [50591.8 IOPS]</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Random Write 4KiB (Q = 32, T = 1): 171.573 MB / s [41887.9 IOPS]</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Sequential Read (T = 1): 443.117 MB / s</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Sequential Write (T = 1): 305.303 MB / s</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Random Read 4KiB (Q = 1, T = 1): 20.027 MB / s [4889.4 IOPS]</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Random Write 4KiB (Q = 1, T = 1): 76.816 MB / s [18753.9 IOPS]</i> <br><br>  But here it is necessary to take into account that the speed of a 128-gigabyte drive is slightly lower.  That is still sufficient, but if you want to get the full potential of this small PC, it makes sense to spend a little more money. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bef/f23/abc/beff23abc48e4eb5bb28495233d41d51.jpg"><br><br>  Could a 12-inch laptop keyboard be comfortable?  Yes, of course.  This space quite allows, the only question is in the qualification of engineers.  In this case, it was possible not only to make the main keys of a normal size, but also to find a place for a number of functional keys.  And about the arrows did not forget.  Fingers lay on the keyboard immediately, no need to get used to it.  And the keystroke, I note, absolutely familiar, comfortable - 1.9 mm.  No tricky designs with a shortened course, like cheap tablets and some premium laptops.  Plus, excellent lighting, not very typical for devices of this class. <br><br>  The only thing you can find fault is one possible angle of fixation of the screen.  It is quite comfortable for people of medium height, but I once grew decently, and therefore, when XPS 12 is on my knees, I would like to reject the screen from myself by 7 degrees. This is not a critical drawback, because you can still work (especially at the table).  But once I noticed - you need to tell.  It is worth noting that in addition to the complete keyboard, Dell releases another thin one.  The key travel is smaller, 1.3 mm, but it is possible to adjust the viewing angle (up to 150 degrees).  Also for these purposes you can use the bundled case folder. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/21e/375/fb0/21e375fb0f8b44c09277f5fde0885a79.jpg"><br><br>  The Dell XPS 12 has two speakers that draw a fairly wide stereo panorama (but without powerful bass, the laws of physics have not yet been banned), a pair of microphones that provide a comfortable Skype conversation even in strong winds, and two cameras ‚Äî the main (8 megapixels) and the front (5 megapixels).  As a replacement for the DSLR, I will not recommend this combine, but for everyday communication, the camera capabilities are more than enough.  Many smartphones take pictures worse. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a55/e9d/5de/a55e9d5de912422f93f55fb22fae603a.jpg"><br><br>  Reading the description of this device on the official website, you can admire the number of interfaces - two Thunderbolt 3, two USB 3.1 Gen.2, and there was a place for the card reader.  Indeed, all this is present, but, as they say, there is a nuance.  Ports Thunderbolt 3 and USB 3.1 combined, and, speaking USB 3.1, we mean USB-C.  When connecting via Thunderbolt, you get a speed of about four times higher (40 Gbit / s instead of 10 Gbit / s via USB), but physically these are the same connectors.  One of them is also used to connect the charger. <br><br>  It seems to me that this is more convenient than the zoo of connectors, especially considering how fast the USB-C infrastructure is developing.  If there are not enough available interfaces (this is quite possible), you can purchase a Dell adapter with USB Type-C and HDMI / VGA / Ethernet / USB 3.0 connectors.  But do not forget that new monitors and projectors can be easily connected via Thunderbolt. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cac/272/329/cac2723299ae4c488536243d7468e3bc.jpg"><br><br>  The reader does not support full-size SD cards, but microSD.  Therefore, it makes sense for photographers to use them in their cameras, via an adapter.  The best samples of microSD already support data recording at speeds up to 100 MB / s, and the transition to this form factor seems to be inevitable.  I remember how skeptical we were about SD support in SLRs.  What could they offer us compared to the right CompactFlash?  But where is this CompactFlash now? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b9d/d9e/8f7/b9dd9e8f72244f6ead8bbf3d1c5be75b.jpg"><br><br>  The Dell Wireless 1820A adapter supports 802.11ac (2x2, up to 866 Mbps) and Bluetooth 4.1.  In the future, it is planned to release a version with LTE-module, a place for SIM is reserved next to the microSD slot. <br><br>  The tablet has a battery of 30 W / h.  It is not removable, and the possibility of choosing a more capacious version is not provided.  A full charge in the usual tablet mode was enough for about five hours, plus or minus 15 minutes.  Under a serious load, of course, it will turn out less - I would expect four hours.  I would like more, but it is worth recalling that we face a) very compact, b) quite powerful and c) a hybrid device.  In fact, this is the only compromise that had to be made during development.  For all other articles, hybridity and compactness did not affect the user experience.  Well, a pleasant moment: the battery is fully charged from scratch in an hour and a half.  And up to 50% and all for half an hour. <br><br>  <b>Different twins</b> <br><br>  In the XPS-Pro store, the <a href="http://xps-pro.ru/catalog/noutbuki-18/4911/%3F_openstat%3DbWFya2V0LnlhbmRleC5ydTvQndC-0YPRgtCx0YPQuiBEZWxsIFhQUyAxMiA5MjUwIFRvdWNoICg5MjUwLTIzMDMpO1RBMmlWdXNsSDFPQkQ4cjZ1Tm1KdkE7%26r1%3Dyandext%26r2%3D%26ymclid%3D62710074992945227084008">tested configuration costs 100,500 rubles</a> . <br><br>  The official site also mentions models with two other processors (Core m7-6Y75 and Core m3-6Y30), with 256 and 512 GB SSDs, and also with Windows 10 Home operating system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b9/75e/a08/2b975ea085984ab2a5c533de4615bad8.jpg"><br><br>  As usual, in our difficult times, a thought might flare - and why is it so expensive?  But such devices, in principle, are not quite cheap.  Place the productive stuffing in a compact case, pick up normal materials - all this is not easy and costs money. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b4d/e1e/22f/b4de1e22f5bd463387b913300011f14e.jpg"><br><br>  The new Dell XPS 12 is a solution for those who really need a compact laptop and tablet.  That is needed and that's it.  Dell engineers squeezed the maximum possible technology available at the moment and made a convenient product weighing 1.27 in the assembly, where the only compromise is not the biggest battery life in the industry. <br><br>  If you are not sure what you think of using the tablet on Windows 10, there are plenty of other options.  For example, the ultrabook Dell XPS 13, which attracts attention in all Microsoft Store in the States, thanks to its almost frameless screen (this also allowed to keep within the dimensions of 12-inch models). <br><br>  But if you really need both, and more, so that in both guises everything is smart, the Dell XPS 12 is currently almost the only choice.  There are, of course, analogs, but there are much more compromises in them.  Clearly more than the joy of saving. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f5a/3c1/f52/f5a3c1f526ba43a49ee553863a3dcc96.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394251/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394251/</a></p>
