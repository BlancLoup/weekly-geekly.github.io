I didn‚Äôt have time to ask the question on what basis they consider that they are being successfully scaled.  And he didn‚Äôt know who the ‚Äúevangelist‚Äù was, whom Timofey called himself :) <br>  And with the law "On the legalization of funds obtained by illegal means," they really are not thought out.  Webmoney's loudest fraud was revealed by surveillance when he saw the sale of a $ 5000 book on a freshly made store.  Will they closely monitor customer transactions?

      Also a question about the share of telephone sales, from which they will receive nothing. <br>  After all, it is clear that each store will stimulate sales by phone.  Yes, and our people are such that they call more often.  What also contributes to the <a href="http://nosikov.ru/%3Fp%3D149">low culture of e-commerce</a> ... <br>  But the project is interesting <br><br>  <a href="http://www.domoway.ru/">www.domoway.ru</a> <br>  Next to him was Alexey Kulichevsky, who 3 months ago spoke with enthusiasm about the analogue of pochemdom.ru and how it would tear up the market - and now the project is closed.  Did they learn this experience "domow"?  Even then there were doubts that the demand for the service was sufficient - and now the project has become even more doubtful in the falling real estate market. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.scribbler.ru/">www.scribbler.ru</a> <br>  As a competitor, Vkontakte was not mentioned at all, but once they let out a couple of extra chips, the service would be defeated.  The main thing for the project will be to successfully entice the audience.  Given that Google Docs may well be used for many of the purposes of using the service, this will be especially difficult.  After all, who needs it - they somehow solve the problem, and the solutions are not so curved. <br>  Careeelab marked the start-up with a premium - free participation in the seminar ‚ÄúVenture investment of Internet projects‚Äù. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.ymap.ru/">www.ymap.ru</a> <br>  In November, I was counting on a similar project myself, already thinking of going out with a plan on the Yellow Pages ... but then after talking with a couple of people I was convinced that this service was not needed for users.  They wanted to discuss this issue on a brainstorm - but they did not have time, but it is much more important than what enterprises need. <br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa business social network, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/startup/34211.html">Yuri Livshits, outlined a long time ago</a> that it was rumored that several teams, having listened to it, began to copy the idea themselves - soon a year, <a href="http://amilner.habrahabr.ru/">Anatoly Milner</a> has been busy with this idea for a long time ... But so far only conversations are not visible. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.minibanda.ru/">www.minibanda.ru</a> - reached the final <br>  At first, he was skeptical about the service, then changed his mind. <br>  The team jumped into a truly unoccupied market. <br>  They do not feel the decline in advertising, the main increase in the user base is in the last 2 months. <br>  Russia is not America, but how well the custom-souvenir diverges well gives the team a reason to hope for a bright future. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.mycli.me/">www.mycli.me</a> <br>  There is no market for the service.  As Bayram Annakov noted later, there is no reason to linger on the service more than 1 time.  A study of the reliability of forecasts do not contribute to their improvement in the future. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.home-money.ru/">www.home-money.ru</a> <br>  The leader did not speak lively, the words about the fact that they have different visions of development with competitors were not convinced. <br>  And competitors are also young and active. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.rockstart.ru/">www.rockstart.ru</a> - reached the final <br>  An interesting non-commercial venture, a good presentation.  Reached the final probably because among all the projects he is personally interested in the largest percentage of voters. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.a5.ru/">www.a5.ru</a> - reached the final <br>  Incendiary performance of the leader Andrei, who cheerfully and confidently answered every question that seemed tricky at first, could not leave indifferent.  And here the team jumped into a truly unoccupied market.  For the last 1.5 months, 2000 flash sites have been created on the site.  The point is for good channels from users. <br><br><h2>  Reports </h2><br>  <strong>Anton Mazhirin (free-lance.ru)</strong> <br>  Anton came out without an announcement, did not say anything, but immediately asked questions - there was no lively discussion. <br>  In general, the service develops well according to the Mamba model: with a mass of proposals, a person slides down, so in order to stand out, you need to pay.  But the case is spoiled by the ‚Äúlegalized spam of pioneers,‚Äù who often do not read the assignment and write a standard answer.  In this I agree with Anton - sometimes the desire to communicate with a person ceases after the first letter. <br><br>  <strong>Bayram Annakov</strong> <br>  Bayram tells interesting things, shifting the principles from one field of knowledge to another ... but somewhat theoretically this is all, although it is interesting to listen with skillful presentation.  And once again reflect on the usefulness of a wide outlook. <br><br><h2>  After-party </h2><br>  There was such a thing, but since the schedule shifted, it did not catch him. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/53351/">https://habr.com/ru/post/53351/</a></p>
