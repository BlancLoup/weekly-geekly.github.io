  <section class="page js-page"><h1>3D in the item description</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day, ladies and gentlemen, <br><br>  To write this topic in "I am promoting" is somewhat wrong, because  We are not looking for customers, but partners.  Therefore, I chose the hubs "Web Development" and "IT Infrastructure."  If the decision is not correct, then please inform the PM. <br><br>  I want to present you one of the projects that should contribute to the penetration of 3D in Online.  The idea is not new, and it has been tried many times to implement, so far, as I understand it, not successfully, because  everywhere it is not used.  The point is that in addition to photos of the product in the store, you can add a 3D model.  Quite often, this model carries more information than a huge set of photos.  This happens for the simple reason that the model is perceived as one, but the photos must also be combined, which is not given to everyone. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The model can be inserted anywhere (almost).  For example, you bought a cool Lego robot for your son, posted photos from your birthday on Odnoklassniki, of course, there is a gift too.  But you can also add a 3D model to the photos (see, what a cool gift!), Especially since it costs nothing and is done quickly.  A couple of months later, the robot got tired of his son, it is a pity to throw him out, because  He is in good condition and not cheap.  A contract is signed with the son: the robot is sold, three weeks of ice cream are not bought (or maybe you need 5 to bring math?), Money from the sale + the above bonus and a new toy is bought.  No sooner said than done.  Old robot put up for auction.  A 3D model is added to the description with photos.  It will look like <a href="http://www.ebay.de/itm/Playmobil-5019-Dinoexpedition-Amphibienfahrzeug-NEU-OVP-/230760104857%3Fpt%3DDE_Allesf%25C3%25BCrKind_Spielzeug_Playmobil%26hash%3Ditem35ba5fc399">this</a> (real lot on E-Bay).  The model is free, buyers are satisfied. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So why did we invent the bicycle again?  Well, because I like the idea itself and I cannot get used to the idea that nobody needs it.  I analyzed other people's implementations and selected key points that, in my opinion, prevent this idea from winning a decent place in the market. <br><br>  1. Difficult.  Many implementations provide for the purchase of a certain number of files that you need to upload to your server and in some place you need to insert some code.  The most annoying thing here is the upload to the server.  For this you need someone who understands this all.  Those.  an ordinary manager cannot do this.  Plus it is also the load on the server (the content is heavy).  Plus, you need to make sure that it all works (access rights, etc.).  Or maybe you also need to change something in the data bank?  Not so impossible.  Our thought is simpler.  You go to us, choose a product, get a link (right there, without departing from the checkout), insert the link in the desired place as a regular photo.  It's all.  This method is perfect for electronic auctions and social networks.  And what about those who have a store?  Every time to climb to our site?  Well, no, this is insanity.  You insert into your system template a link to our script and one div where our button will appear.  Now, besides the ‚Äúinsert photo‚Äù button, you also have the ‚Äúinsert 3D model‚Äù button.  What happens if some goods are no longer for sale?  Is it out of date, for example, has a new model come out or has it ‚Äúnot gone‚Äù at all?  It would be good for you to delete the model files.  In the variant with the storage of files at home you will have to solve this problem in some way.  With us you just have to go to your account and press exactly one button.  From this moment your link is not active. <br><br>  2. Price.  Most implementations of this idea assume a ‚Äúmoney-in-the-evening chairs‚Äù scheme.  On a human, this means pay 15-20 ‚Ç¨, download the archive, do what you want with it.  And if it turned out that no one is looking at this model?  Or do you have exactly three copies of the product and will no longer be?  It would be desirable to have a model, and to buy here not especially.  Who knows, maybe all 3 will be sold in 3 days?  Yes, these 15-20 ‚Ç¨ seems not so much, but here is a toad ... We made it easier.  For the current link is taken daily rent.  How many times a model has been shown is absolutely not important.  If you see that you do not need a model, go to your account and turn it off.  In your system, you delete the link (like a regular photo).  It's all.  The price is chosen so that if using the model you have sold at least one copy more than without it, then you have not lost it. <br><br>  3. Upgrade.  There was a new version of the spinner, for example, a feature was added (you can dynamically change the color of the product) or a bug was fixed.  What will you do if the files are with you?  Then who in that much, several options, from good to very bad.  We have no options at all.  The upgrade will happen unnoticed for you, just like in chrome (we have all the files :)). <br><br>  Naturally, our implementation has its flaws and we do not argue with that.  But we <s>hope</s> sure that the pros outweigh the cons. <br><br>  Our attempts to promote this service showed the following: <br><br><ul><li>  We send a proposal for cooperation </li><li>  We are told: very interesting </li><li>  We say: well, so let's work! </li><li>  We are told: we have 100,500 products, before we begin, we are very interested to find out who you are and where you come from? </li><li>  We answer: ... (and what can we say?) </li><li>  We are told: well, of course, everyone ever started.  And who can recommend you? </li><li>  Hmm .... (well, I certainly can recommend my partner, and he me, but for some reason it seems to me, this is not exactly what is expected) </li></ul><br><br>  It's a vicious circle.  Attempts to break out of it independently brought us a lot of experience but no practical effect.  We need, so to speak, shoulder support.  We are ready to ‚Äúsell‚Äù to those who would use this service with themselves / partners / customers.  That would be enough for us to return to our previous potential customers and finally be able to say: We are reliable partners and our customers can confirm this! <br><br>  Well, at the end of the link to the <a href="http://3d-port.com/">service</a> itself (and for <a href="http://3d-port.com/WidgetDiv/">example</a> API). <br><br>  Ideas, suggestions, constructive criticism are welcome. <br><br>  PS Naturally, the question arises, where <s>does the</s> model come from?  Most of the models we want to make ourselves (at the beginning), but in general we expect that there will be a sufficiently large number of people who will make models, fill them with us and receive their legitimate share from it. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> <br><br>  Apparently from comments, I probably not absolutely correctly described a problem. <br>  The problem is not related to the product, customers like the product, there are no questions for it.  Questions to us: who we are, who is behind us.  This is the problem I want to solve. <br><br>  Example: <br>  You produce cars and want to sell them in Germany.  The Germans made a crash test and the car was not allowed for sale.  You write on the forum: gentlemen, we have a problem with a crash test, we need a person to solve this problem.  And in the comments you write about it: man, your car is full of cocoa, because  the seats there are not comfortable and in general this car is more red in color. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140246/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140246/</a></p>
