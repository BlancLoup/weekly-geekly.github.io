All today's "winners" were then pioneers.  Therefore, if you start now, you are in great disadvantage compared to them. <br><br>  On the other hand, do not think that success is impossible, you just have to align your fantasies with reality.  Understand for yourself that multibillion-dollar deals "do not threaten you."

      <strong>Forget about protecting your content.</strong> <br>  If your plans offer content, then you first want to protect it.  The problem is that in Web 2.0 you should be not only ready to completely ignore copyright, but also to break all sorts of business logic.  Instead of fighting windmills, better read about <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons licenses</a> and choose the one that suits you best. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>Be prepared for contradictions</strong> <br>  Your education at business school puts you at a disadvantage compared to those who are involved in social networking (social networking).  The rules teach you to protect your interests, while the social network is primarily about sharing information.  You must somehow find a compromise between the expected benefits and the values ‚Äã‚Äãthat prevail in the community that you form.  It is not easy and any reaction of potential buyers will immediately follow any manifestations of cynicism. <br><br>  <strong>Your position is initially unprofitable</strong> <br>  Classically, the information that arrives to customers is clearly controlled by the company itself.  In social networks, you simply lose this control.  Customers will criticize you if they see fit.  When you try to control or eliminate criticism, your efforts will be just another source of complaints and discontent. <br><br>  On the Internet, user interactivity is manifested in the form of conversations and discussion, and you should be prepared for surprises.  Be polite and attentive.  Develop a sense of need to intervene.  Usually, if community members talk about the same thing, or powerful characters discuss something, it's time to act.  Only in the case when only a small part of the community or lemmings criticize you, you can ignore such flashes. <br><br>  <strong>Don't stand still</strong> <br>  Honest behavior is appreciated in any community, and Web 2.0 is no exception.  Let us understand as much as possible that you value and respect honesty - not only in your actions on the Internet, but also in all your other affairs.  You will be unnecessarily contradictory and changeable - and the community will christen you as a hypocrite. <br><br>  <strong>Community building takes a lot of time and effort</strong> <br>  Even if you already have clients, starting the site is not enough.  The most successful Web 2.0 sites are promoted through good advertising, blogs, and mail forums.  Maybe it sounds trite, but you have to feed your community.  Otherwise, you will have an empty site that no one uses. <br><br>  <strong>Do not lose contact with the community</strong> <br>  It may take time for you to learn to communicate with your community, and when you have a good relationship, try to maintain them.  There are examples where the loss of communication with the community led to the fact that users have gone to a competitor. <br><br>  <strong>Think constantly about something new.</strong> <br>  Like shared hosting in the nineties, Web 2.0 offers a low bar for entry into the business.  In other words, to become a player, you do not need expertise and massive development, especially if you chose FOSS for further development.  Web 2.0 has been around for several years, and experience shows that communities are very fickle - users go to more fashionable sites without any problems.  Therefore, in order to keep people, do not stop developing.  Think over new things that will attract more new users and keep existing ones. <br><br>  There is one problem: the simpler the site concept is, the harder it is to implement innovations.  If your site is not an idea in itself, like del.isio.us, you can reach the moment when you will need to radically change the direction of development to keep the business. <br><br>  <strong>Know the sources of profit</strong> <br>  Almost everything you do will be rejected by the community.  If you advertise, users will complain.  If you enter a monthly fee like Classmates.com, you lose a community that you can potentially make a profit of. <br><br>  The truth is that money is the part of Web 2.0 that no one can really explain.  There is a company that has invested about a million dollars in a business-oriented social network over four years, and now at an eBay auction, its initial price is $ 60,000. <br><br>  The surest way, of course, is a growing community, large enough for the project to find a buyer.  And even in this case there is no guarantee to return the invested funds. <br><br>  <strong>Conclusion</strong> <br>  If these tips seemed pessimistic to you, you understood correctly what I am getting at.  You still have a year or two to develop the project.  Web 2.0, as a business phenomenon, defies management in classic ways.  If you still want to make money on Web 2.0, you need to grow with lightning speed and build up the community even faster.  Next year at the same time, Web 2.0 will be history. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://www.itmanagersjournal.com/feature/21847">www.itmanagersjournal.com</a> <br>  Author: Bruce Byfield on Web 2.0: </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/1404/">https://habr.com/ru/post/1404/</a></p>
