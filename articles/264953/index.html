New: access points, controllers and functionality</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Today we want to talk about new products from the manufacturer of WiFi equipment <a href="http://comptek.ru/catalog/ruckus/">Ruckus Wireless</a> , and there are a lot of them in several quarters: 7 <a href="http://comptek.ru/catalog/ruckus/2XZK">access points of the</a> standard 802.11ac, including Wave 2, a new <a href="http://comptek.ru/catalog/ruckus/2XZJ">controller</a> and a new functionality. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/013/cfe/867/013cfe86705e4554a023a6a86aefcf7d.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There are a large number of wireless WiFi systems from various manufacturers on the market, representing both minimalistic solutions based on autonomous access points, as well as centralized solutions with a network controller or cloud solutions with a cloud controller. <br><br>  In our opinion, Ruckus equipment stands out from the competition with its capabilities, performance and reasonable price.  In this article we will give an overview of the model range and architecture of networks presented by the manufacturer at the end of the past and the beginning of this year. <br><br>  The Ruckus Wireless system is a hybrid of autonomous and centralized networks of the American manufacturer.  As in centralized networks, Ruckus supports seamless roaming of subscribers, optimization of radio coverage (selection of optimal radio channels and capacities), load balancing and centralized management.  Moreover, the ZoneDirector controller is able to authorize users via the built-in user base and the external RADIUS server and perform web authorization.

      From autonomous access points, Ruckus uses the ability to locate access points behind a routed network and Internet channels, as well as the ability to switch users' traffic locally, without sending it through the controller, which allows the controller to be installed remotely and control currents through a small capacity channel.  Each point can be configured as a router, raise the L2TP connection and implement NAT.  Thus, it becomes possible to locate access points remotely and connect them to various Internet channels. <br><br>  We give a description of the updated range of Ruckus Wireless.  It includes access points and street and internal performance of the product line ZoneFlex <br><br>  <b>Internal access points</b> <br><br>  The new generation of internal ZoneFlex R-series access points - models R300, R 500, R600, R700 and R710. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/461/718/234/461718234fb3455fa2e50152605cdeea.jpg"><br><br>  Consider the most interesting features of new devices in more detail. <br><br>  One of the important functions that should be mentioned, given the state of the ether - is a spectrum analyzer.  All new points, except for the R300, are equipped with an ether analyzer and use it when choosing a frequency rating.  It is also possible to connect to a remote access point and transfer it to analyzer mode to study the current situation on the air. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5bd/4d5/adb/5bd4d5adbad14a93a41326301ad5d56a.jpg"><br>  <i>Spectrum analyzer embedded in Ruckus access points</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  Specifications points in more detail. <br><br>  <b>R300</b> <br><br>  The ZoneFlex R300 is the youngest model of the new generation, replacing the ZoneFlex 7363. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e27/22e/247/e2722e2475874e7799770f5f49505a45.jpg"><br>  <i>Appearance ZoneFlex R300.</i>  <i>The point is very compact - dimensions 13 x 13 x 2.8 cm</i> <i><br></i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d11/92f/304/d1192f30498b4984b4015f5a72935faf.jpg"><br>  Antenna System Access Point ZoneFlex R300 <br><br>  Two 802.11n radio modules, an adaptive antenna and small dimensions make the R300 a convenient solution for networks with low subscriber density (cafes, hotels).  However, we, of course, are more interested in new access points with 802.11ac support, and there are quite a few of them. <br><br>  <b>R500 and R600</b> <br><br>  ZoneFlex R500 and R600 - use boards and radio modules, similar to the model R700, but have a less developed antenna system.  Actually, the R600 model differs from the R500 with a more complex antenna system and the number of MIMO streams.  These points are positioned as mid-level solutions. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/723/90e/2da/72390e2dafac4de7bfe8f213d1102924.jpg"><br>  <i>The appearance of access points ZoneFlex R500 / R600</i> <i><br></i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce5/033/13e/ce503313e89e435bb3961b44a6469c57.jpg"><br>  <i>Antenna system ZoneFlex R500 (left) and R600 (right)</i> <i><br></i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/56c/4b9/078/56c4b9078f0a414187e4cca8ae2325bc.jpg"><br>  On the construction of the point R500 / 600 remind ZoneFlex 7372, but uses more modern components <br><br>  <b>R700</b> <br><br>  ZoneFlex R700 is a high-performance access point with support for 3 channels of MIMO 802.11ac.  Point offers support for new technologies, such as spectral analysis of the air and optimizing the maintenance of smartphones and tablets using a combination of signals of different polarization antennas. <br><br>  The R700 allows you to get a useful performance of more than 650 Mbps in the 5 GHz band when powered from a standard 802.3af source. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91b/ad9/89f/91bad989f1374a7fbf700788ffafed43.jpg"><br>  <i>3-channel antenna system ZoneFlex R700</i> <i><br></i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb9/464/756/eb94647560ee4b6aa9c654514e298269.jpg"><br>  View from the connectors <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dca/0dd/2e5/dca0dd2e517f41aaa2254df417d46ff9.jpg"><br><br>  <b>R710</b> <br><br>  The ZoneFlex R710 is the latest development of Ruckus, the first access point with support for Wave 2 of the 802.11ac standard with a bandwidth of 800 Mbps in the 2.4 GHz frequency band plus 1733 Mbps in the 5 GHz band, for a total of 2.5 for the access point Gbit / s  In addition to speed, Multi-User MIMO technology (abbreviated as MU-MIMO) is supported, that is, the R710 can serve several subscribers simultaneously.  Namely, the device provides a dedicated channel with full bandwidth to three clients at once.  The effect of spatial separation of the signal and reuse of radio frequency resources is used.  As a result, the efficiency of the use of the ether, the performance and the availability of the medium are increased.  As you can see, even the form factor of the equipment has changed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d97/ea7/a3a/d97ea7a3afca4db0859d7a8e251bdf1e.jpg"><br>  <i>The appearance of the access point ZoneFlex R710</i> <i><br></i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c52/e9a/c4c/c52e9ac4cc3e4ca3bd0d276c62603416.jpg"><br>  <i>Antenna system ZoneFlex R710</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  <b>Street access points</b> <br><br>  There are three new access points in all-weather performance of the standard 802.11ac - ZoneFlex T300, T301s and T301n <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/157/354/671/157354671c004ccebbc6fd3bd537ab0d.jpg"><br><br>  Earlier, when building networks outside the premises, we used the ZoneFlex 7762 access point, an all-weather solution that has proven itself in many installations. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/18f/fb1/66d/18ffb166d3cb428dbdd878168ab2f014.jpg"><br>  <i>The appearance of the access point ZoneFlex 7762 and the antenna system, which conquered the market in its time</i> <i><br></i> <br>  But the point is possible for the present times is quite large and does not have the support of 802.11ac.  Therefore, the new T300 series is a logical continuation of the 7762 now with support for the AC standard. <br><br>  Unlike the 7762S, all T300 / 301 models have built-in adaptive antennas of both frequency ranges, while to use 5 GHz in the 7762S you had to use an additional antenna. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d57/19b/a95/d5719ba957c040788dcbb744d4d654f6.jpg"><br>  <i>Appearance ZoneFlex T300 (left) and T301 (right)</i> <i><br></i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/86a/5ca/baf/86a5cabaf3e549cca8ebad5bedcbcbc0.jpg"><br>  <i>Antenna system ZoneFlex T300</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/341/c05/662/341c056622f948ce807c1a78998fc5c4.jpg"><br>  <i>Antenna system ZoneFlex T301n</i> <br><br>  It must be remembered that all the benefits of 802.11ac technology are realized only in the 5 GHz band, which is subject to licensing.  However, a smaller footprint than the 7762 makes the T300 / 301 series very interesting when introducing 2.4 GHz networks.  Note that all Ruckus access points can be used both in standalone mode, that is, by themselves, and in the version with a master controller. <br><br>  <b>WiFi Network Controllers</b> <br><br>  The line of Ruckus controllers has been significantly updated this year.  We would even say it has been refreshed and doubled: now, in addition to the classic ZoneDirector line, which includes the new 1200 model, a new operator line SmartZone has appeared. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/447/318/77b/44731877bf684191b03339792a268d4b.jpg"><br>  <i>Ruckus Controller Family</i> <br><br>  However, the differences between ZoneDirector and SCG are so great that we will publish a separate article about the new SCG lineup.  Therefore, allow me to present the network controller of the ZoneDirector 1200 model for the time being, and then make a small announcement of the SmartZone 100 model. <br><br>  Table of key parameters of controllers <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/695/7d9/119/6957d9119a204cd588e6b22029c5ee02.jpg"><br><br>  From the point of view of the 1200 model range, the model becomes closer to the 3000 series and allows you to build fairly large WiFi networks. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/089/11b/5d1/08911b5d1fb740e8b307106d53c50441.jpg"><br><br>  Let's compare the ZoneDirector controllers of the thousandth series and note the following improvement in parameters 1200 over 1100: <br><br>  1. One and a half times more capacity by the number of supported access points <br>  2. One and a half times more capacity by the number of connections <br>  3. The possibility of licensing in increments of one access point <br><br>  We also list the functionality implemented by the Ruckus controller.  When using the controller, the network acquires additional features: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Centralized management <br>  ‚Ä¢ Seamless roaming <br>  ‚Ä¢ Self-organizing MESH networks <br>  ‚Ä¢ load balancing <br>  ‚Ä¢ Central radio planning <br>  ‚Ä¢ Guest client authorization <br>  ‚Ä¢ Guest authorization of clients with data protection <br>  ‚Ä¢ 3G-offload, including HotSpot 2.0 <br><br>  <b>SmartZone 100</b> <br><br>  SmartZone 100 allows you to administer WiFi networks of operators and enterprises.  The device is capable of serving 1024 access points, 25,000 simultaneous sessions and 2048 VLANs.  Moreover, it is possible to combine up to four devices in a cluster (3 + 1 for redundancy) and achieve network management of an impressive scale: 3 thousand access points, 60 thousand simultaneous sessions and 6 thousand VLANs. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/274/7e5/84b/2747e584b5a743eba2083bfdcc39afd0.jpg"><br><br>  <b>New software</b> <b><br></b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea8/7b8/c4c/ea87b8c4c8484e08bc2c5bbc27ba1517.jpg"><br><br>  More recently, Ruckus controller software has been updated to version 9.9, and now we can talk about version 9.10.  What new features does this software promise us? <br><br>  First, it is the user's self-registration.  If earlier during web authorization, it was necessary to give the client a password at the reception, or set up an SMS gateway when registering with a mobile phone number, then now we can use the link to the inviting person.  When registering on the page, the user specifies his data, who invited him, and this information comes to the email of the inviting person who can confirm access to the guest. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b5b/789/5fc/b5b7895fc71a4436a5c5edb129c979fc.jpg"><br>  <i>The scheme itself registration using the inviting person</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  The second important news we would call the emergence in the new software for access points of the standard AC technology MESH.  It was strange that the new access points lack the functionality of older models.  Yes, and the capacity of 802.11ac definitely has to this implementation. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/68d/835/02c/68d83502cd8d4d32b19c5cdd72c2ac77.jpg"><br>  <i>Manufacturer emphasizes MESH availability in 802.11ac solutions</i> <i><br></i> <br>  Although there is support for technology at all new points, it must be remembered that it is legal to use 5 GHz broadcasts only indoors. <br><br>  However, there are certain features of the use of new software, which should be mentioned.  Firstly, the 1100-series controller has some limitations, although software 9.10 exists for it, it does not support H500 access points.  Secondly, not all devices will be able to deliver new software.  If earlier Ruckus recommended acquiring support for devices, and only warned about its absence in the menu, then now it will not be possible to install on the controller deprived of support software 9.10. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/168/9f6/bea/1689f6bea8f04918acf93d9d0dc76c4d.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Software update scheme 9.10</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  <b>findings</b> <br><br>  This year, Ruckus has updated almost the entire line of its equipment.  Now we can get at the same time the advantage of adaptive antennas and the support of the standard 802.11ac, which is implemented in the access points R500 / 600/700/710.  All-weather points of the T300 / 301 series now support the 802.11ac standard, have smaller dimensions than the model of the ZoneFlex 7762 and have become significantly lower in price.  The new controller of the ZoneDirector 1200 model noticeably exceeds the model 1100 and now the border of small WiFi networks has shifted upwards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a1e/aac/c4c/a1eaacc4c2bf40c084441e8f0777d5ed.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/264953/">https://habr.com/ru/post/264953/</a></p>
