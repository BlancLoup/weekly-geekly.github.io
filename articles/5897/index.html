  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What Yandex benefits from buying my circle</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Some thoughts on how the purchase of my Circle can be beneficial to Yandex.  Many, many things. <br><br>  As we recently roughly estimated, the size of the purchased community is about five hundred two hundred and fifty thousand accounts.  Based on the device of my Circle and the figures of half a million, we can assume that about a tenth of them are active (27-35k users, such a user logs once every two months, updates their contact lists), and not more than one and a half percent participate in discussions ( versatile forums with an audience of 3-5k users - this is very strong).  What kind of benefits and resources does this crowd offer? <br>  Ready user base (which means the integration of often anonymous accounts in a Yandex passport with specific people in my Circle is of great value for advertising profiles and segmentation, which, however, Yandex is not so interesting); <br>  Ready social network (links, "resume", groups, a lot of work for statistics and analysis); <br>  Ready content generator (blogs, communities, topics). <br><br>  It is even cooler than buying Yahu upcoming.org, because everything accumulated by Yandex and my Circle allows you to move in any convenient direction, embedding Yandex services inside social network interfaces and integrating social networks into Yandex services.

      It‚Äôs too early to rely on social search, and all sorts of things related to maps (it‚Äôs the most for collective hikes and events), catalogs, references, bookmarks ‚Äî anything, Yandex has enough imagination.  Even if you simply integrate Yandex mail with my Circle, combining your address book, messaging and volume user profiles - this will be an unambiguous killer application for office users (the very thing Kukuts said: ‚ÄúThe service is convenient for managing professional contacts ‚Äî in my 1- Circle has more than 100 people ").  It remains to buy only one component - the calendar.  In RuNet, I have not yet seen any sane calendar applications comparable to Google Calendar.  So ready empty niche for a startup. <br><br>  I am personally reassured by only one thing - to pull it all out, none of the large companies will have enough resources.  And this is another explanation of why they bought my Circle: removing from the service a lot of headaches for administration and support, the most interesting people (creators and ideologues) can be lured to other projects due to the free time, or help to develop new branches around My Circle itself in Yandex. <br><br>  * * * <br><br>  Finally, buying a social network helps Yandex in a rather interesting sense: it is an ideal tool for business intelligence - who, where, when and with whom he worked, what he did.  Theoretically, this information is already visible and accessible to everyone, but the competitive advantage of Yandex analytics is direct access to the database and the ability to attach to these data the algorithms purchased together with Integrum developers. <br><br>  Then you can build drawings and sketches to gain world domination in Russia, although I still can‚Äôt imagine that Yandex will be able to drastically reverse Google‚Äôs advantage in processing this data. <br><br>  But it is extremely pleasing to the fact that one of the local large companies has bitten off a large chunk of the social networking market, and with a clear ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù focus.  It remains to wait and see who, with a fright, will try to buy Odnoklassnikov.ru, with their stated million and eight hundred thousand users and a completely insane interface. <br><br>  <a href="http://urbansheep.livejournal.com/1582948.html">Learn urbansheep</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/5897/">https://habr.com/ru/post/5897/</a></p>
