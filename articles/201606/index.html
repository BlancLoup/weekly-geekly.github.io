  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Interlight Moscow and novelties from Notehnika</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The exhibition <a href="http://www.interlight.messefrankfurt.ru/">Interlight Moscow</a> , dedicated to a variety of power devices, connections, lighting and other electronics, was held <a href="http://www.interlight.messefrankfurt.ru/">at the</a> Expocenter from 5 to 8.  Unfortunately, I was able to get there only by the end of her last working day, and therefore I managed to capture quite a bit of the Chinese and talk with the director of nighttechnics about their new products. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f82/d8a/5af/f82d8a5af12a2e3bbb1419ad2a2a674b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  But <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/alexeynadezhin/" class="user_link">AlexeyNadezhin</a> <a href="http://ammo1.livejournal.com/433674.html">bypassed it</a> all, so it would be useful to read it too. <br>  By the way, I put the title picture on him. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I already wrote about the NooLite system <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/boxowerview/blog/168039/">twice</a> when I was talking about a smart house.  Remember what indignant comments?  Touch buttons and lack of feedback.  So, both of these problems (the second one - almost, as far as possible with the current technology), the company decided. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d6d/672/8b2/d6d6728b29ccd3331b17cd4bb418f435.jpg"><br>  Now you can take the unit and connect it to your regular switch.  Looks like I rushed to bury a hole from the switch :) <br>  It looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/999/d0c/824/999d0c82492823bbe337fb22240c4a46.jpg"><br>  The case, by the way, turns out to be made under the bottom plates.  And I thought just like that.  In general, if someone did not like switches that did not have a tactile response - the problem is solved.  True, inside this unit - all the same battery CR2032.  As for me - there you can squeeze in a lot more, but for some reason they still stay on such batteries.  Well, but you can buy them anywhere. <br>  By the way, such consoles are designed not for one switch, but for three.  Those.  Up to three separate buttons can be connected to one unit: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/804/124/079/8041240797b41845672e082095f299d8.jpg"><br>  The code of new models is PK, there are 4 of them in the series, the functions of the first three are the same as those of the consoles: <br>  <a href="http://www.noo.com.by/pult-pk311.html">PK311</a> - three channels, pressing - change of state, hold - brightness control. <br>  <a href="http://www.noo.com.by/pult-pk312.html">PK312</a> - three scenarios <br>  <a href="http://www.noo.com.by/pult-pk313.html">PK313</a> - two channels, one script <br>  But the fourth, <a href="http://www.noo.com.by/pult-pk314.html">PK314 is the</a> most interesting.  If all the previous ones are oriented to return switches (with a spring), which work as clock buttons, then the PK314 is connected to a conventional switch, which can be in one of two positions - either on or off.  Accordingly, when re-clicking the switch, the block sends a ‚Äúturn on‚Äù or ‚Äúturn off‚Äù signal.  Full emulation of a conventional switch.  I had to sacrifice the brightness adjustment, but people who did not want to change their reflexes would remain calm.  Well, he also has 3 separate channels.

      They also made a gateway to the local network: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/330/af8/5be/330af85beaa5148519f853a520d8b3e0.jpg"><br>  The task of which is to show a beautiful page with light control buttons: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/645/3a2/cbb/6453a2cbbaa8701737d103990eb7c694.jpg"><br>  How it is configured, though not shown. <br><br>  From rather old novelties - the controller of RGB-tapes: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cf7/3d5/c44/cf73d5c44a79c14ea539767e0e719acf.jpg"><br>  Through the command he can set the brightness of each channel separately. <br><br>  Soon the temperature and humidity sensor will appear: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/114/77c/525/11477c5251c070c8d99840bd60f5a183.jpg"><br>  They promised in two versions - indoor and outdoor.  True, so far, as I understand it, the opportunity to set scripts is not yet available.  If I want to turn on the fan in the bathroom to achieve a certain level of humidity, I‚Äôll have to get signals from it on the computer, and again with handles, handles.  Designer is the same! <br><br>  Another appeared external protected unit 2 kilowatts: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/534/0e9/7ce/5340e97ce6b69361f585f65c4da83a83.jpg"><br>  Well, in a protected box, I myself can hide a normal block, but it seems like there is something fixed for it to work correctly at negative temperatures.  I'll get it - I'll sort it out. <br><br>  Another very cool - motion sensor on the PIR.  When a motion is detected, it sends a signal to the executive unit ‚Äî turn it on, and if there is no motion for a while, turn it off. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fe4/0b6/22b/fe40b622b038ff9cc00991d71c8dbf75.jpg"><br>  On the same photo - the new version of the switch, with the processed antenna.  They promise an increase in range. <br>  These new buildings are pouring themselves in their mold.  I did not like the body because it looks more cumbersome than the previous one, although it is just one millimeter higher. <br><br>  And about the feedback - they made a command receiver for the computer.  Well, you understand.  As a transmitter, only a receiver. <br>  Called RX1164, and can receive up to 64 different channels.  It can receive a signal from the control buttons, and in the program can memorize it.  Thus, the smart home controller will not know whether the lamp is on or not, but it will be able to see which command was sent to the unit last time.  Not bad either, since there is no full feedback. <br><br>  There was also an amusing jazz case showed - the transmitter was connected to the doorbell button, the receiver on the computer received the signal and kicked the computer, he took a photo of the visitor through the door peephole camera, and sent it to the landlord‚Äôs phone.  A man came to you when you were not at home, rang the bell, and you get a photo right there. <br>  If you attach the control unit to an electrically operated lock, you can immediately open it with a command from the phone and let it sit, wait for you. <br><br>  Now about the Chinese.  Leaving the exhibition, they sold everything they could: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f7/a27/34b/2f7a2734b9b527c28b90db01bc4ed665.jpg"><br>  Apparently, I did not want to take the lamps back. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e92/7c3/30c/e927c330c4bbbd9239c086dde740a480.jpg"><br>  But the neighbors of the Chinese were not very happy: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0f7/f94/dae/0f7f94daeb55ead2c6ff55702150b8f0.jpg"><br>  They probably got them. <br><br>  Little gig porn: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6f1/26e/7c3/6f126e7c3161624b85141fd985456abe.jpg"><br>  I wonder what is behind the LED panels? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/06f/b12/001/06fb12001636f8ca16dea8b465c08d85.jpg"><br>  It turned out not particularly interesting.  Something like shift registers. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/07f/ae0/b4a/07fae0b4ab6daa4ea4f9e5a9755ad97a.jpg"><br>  The panels lay literally under their feet: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/166/500/660/1665006603019ab1bbec0f9c5b8998f2.jpg"><br><br>  Stand Wago (terminals, mi-mi-mi): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ed9/c40/8b1/ed9c408b1cb2c85ac73d37263e4b760b.jpg"><br>  Controlled crane in section: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/746/5b7/03a/7465b703a66ae389919159c2d323272a.jpg"><br>  By the way, it seems solenoid. <br><br>  Offer to turn on and click on the wires.  I did not dare. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/06d/db5/74a/06ddb574af2cc2541d1a556106fba4a4.jpg"><br>  Another booth of another company dedicated to the smart home.  This time, mainly ModBus and X10. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/495/33d/406/49533d4065faa4a8213f632b138822ad.jpg"><br><br>  Finally, an eagle from printed circuit boards from a resonate. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3aa/46f/f0b/3aa46ff0b16a585072d8a0b6da57e636.jpg"><br>  That they so hint at the needles? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/33f/a8a/335/33fa8a335356a938b36fdee8e31369f1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If you do not have an account on Habrahabr, you can read and comment on our articles on <a href="http://boxoverview.com/news/interlight-moscow-i-novinki-ot-nootexniki">BoxOverview.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/201606/">https://habr.com/ru/post/201606/</a></p>
