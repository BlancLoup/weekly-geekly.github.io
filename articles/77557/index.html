  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Who teaches us?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Are you a student?  Were they?  Imagine that you are in our shoes. <br><br>  I want to write one episode that I had a couple of days ago.  My relative, a student at Krivozhsky University, asked to help her write a term paper.  The subject is related to system programming.  At the lectures, they read C and Assembler (probably everyone understands that for 18 lectures of which there will be a maximum of 14 you can read only the basics).  He offered her to write the output characteristics of the computer using interrupts.  The task is not complicated, but also not very easy.  You have to write in the documentation and test everything.  Almost all the characteristics that we have touched.  She also benefited, could learn a lot: work closer with iron and understand how a computer works.  For a 3rd year student this is normal, especially since she is a girl and most likely she will not work in her specialty. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We thought she would like the coursework, because  he had not yet read the lectures, but we already had a program and began to ‚Äúfill in‚Äù the course text.  But the teacher said that this task was very easy to solve and said to do it over.  She asked me to suggest that it would not be easy (in his eyes), he suggested writing Plug and Play under Windows using Linux sources.  She asked for a book or maybe articles where they wrote about it in order to have an idea, because  at the lecture he talked only about registers and minimal actions with them.  He said: <i>"I still write a term paper for you?"</i> . <br><br>  She is very worried because  the task is very difficult for her and for me ... Who was in such a situation?  Can you advise what to do?
