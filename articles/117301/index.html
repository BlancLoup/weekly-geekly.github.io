  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Opera 11.10 - spring release</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today came the next version of Opera browser under number 11.10.  At first glance, the number did not change much, only one-tenth, but behind it there are quite large and interesting changes.  Of course, many have already tried the test builds and have seen what the developers at Opera Software have been working on in recent weeks.  It's time to evaluate the innovations.  So, let's begin. <br><br><img src="http://files.myopera.com/IlyaShpankov/files/sd.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of all - the Express panel has undergone significant changes.  And, at first glance, nothing much happened, the same panel, the same small thumbnails, well, they look and are placed a little differently ... In fact, it was active work on this component of the browser.  It can be said that with a slight external difference from the previous type, the concept of cells itself has changed radically.  Now it‚Äôs not just buttons-links to your favorite sites, it‚Äôs also convenient informers that allow you to receive various news from resources, links to which are placed in cells.  True, this is possible only on condition that the owners of these resources themselves properly prepare the content for display in the Opera Express Operator cell.  Otherwise, either the site logo or some of its most visible part will be displayed.  Also now the user can assign a name for the cell, if the original is not satisfied with something. <br><br><img src="http://files.myopera.com/IlyaShpankov/files/sd-add-new.png" alt="image" align="right">  Another innovation - significantly expanded the means of setting up and managing the contents of the Express panel - a small button in the upper right corner allows access to them.  In addition to the already familiar background changes, you can choose different types of location and size of cells or rely on the browser and its ability to automatically place cells depending on their number.  And the amount is now not limited to anything: add as much as you want.  The magic cell with a plus is intended for this.  Which, however, is easily hidden through the same settings Express panel.

    <img src="http://files.myopera.com/IlyaShpankov/files/turbo.png" alt="image" align="left">  Now - about the speed.  It is clear that the browser began to work even faster.  This may not even be indicated in press releases.  But Opera has a unique feature that is directly related to speed - Opera Turbo.  And a lot of work was also done on it.  The changes, again, are mostly internal, such as an <a href="http://my.opera.com/chooseopera/blog/on-a-horse-opera-turbo-to-the-rescue">improvement in the image compression algorithm</a> , which allows displaying higher-quality images, but there are external additions - in the form of a special menu that opens when you click on the indicator.  The menu provides quite detailed information on how much specifically saved in grams ... in bytes and as a percentage.  It should appeal to those who are used to tightly control their expenses, incl.  and on the internet. <br><br>  Another change, which not only can be said, but also shown - is the page with an error message.  As it turned out, it can also be improved.  In particular, suggest searching for information in one of the popular search engines. <br><br><img src="http://files.myopera.com/IlyaShpankov/files/error-page.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In fact, there are a lot of changes, and, importantly, a lot of bugs fixed since the previous version was released.  And first of all - thanks to your bug reports.  So we expect the same activity from you in the future - Opera still has a lot of plans and ideas, and with your help they will appear faster and with higher quality. <br><br>  You can download the new version from the <a href="http://www.opera.com/download">official site.</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/windows/1110/">List of changes in Opera 11.10</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.opera.com/docs/specs/presto28/">List of web technologies supported by Opera Presto 2.8</a> <br><br>  And for dessert - a small movie dedicated to checking the speed of Opera. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/D0VPwvSaCUg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhcQnIHUfbXGDokehEFCA-1UbVc-w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117301/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117301/</a></p>
