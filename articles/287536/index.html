  <section class="page js-page"><h1>American Roly Zhukov or Crying Blogger</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As a small introductory word, I will say that this letter was sent by the American designer-blogger Alex Hope, John Cho (y), one of the most famous American blogger-moneymakers.  And that it can potentially be repeated by thousands (hundreds of thousands) of bloggers.  I set forth my own thoughts about the letter <a href="http://www.design-freak.com/blogging/amerikanskij-blogovanka-zhukov/">there</a> , and here it is just a translation, with the punctuation preserved and (where possible) lexical coloring. <br><br>  ‚ÄúHello, John! <br><br>  I'm your recent reader, and I'm new to blogging too.  And also in monetization and so on ... I decided to start a blog in January of this year.  I called the blog ‚ÄúI love Vektor.com‚Äù because I like the design and I wanted to do something useful for other designers and also have a little money on it.

      I loveVector.com is a resource where designers can download ‚Äúroyalty free‚Äù vector graphics for their needs ... in short ... I‚Äôm writing to you because I‚Äôm just a designer myself ... And I don‚Äôt know anything about monetizing a blog and traffic conversion.  According to statistics, in February there were 1487 unique visitors in my blog, in April - 10354, in June - 30044, in August - 47305, and in September - 67301. Also in September there were 85,211 visits, 565132 page views (6.63 pages per visitor) and 3,074,280 hits.  My rank in Alex is 178085 and PR - 4. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  About 176 cliparts are available for download on this site.  Free - 121, the rest are sold at prices from $ 1.99 - $ 14.99.  We sell clip art (for some reason, ‚Äúwe‚Äù, yeah; note of Misha) for $ 200 per month.  Another $ 30- $ 80 bring 125h125 banners in the sidebar and that's it.  I've been thinking, maybe it's worth adding visitors the opportunity to upload their own cliparts and sell them on the site at a rate of 50 to 50?  This is a very generous offer and it will surely attract people.  By the way, this will save me from having to draw everything myself. <br><br>  But not the point.  My question is: who can translate all these numbers into how much a blog can really bring me?  John, if ‚ÄúI loveVector.com‚Äù was your blog, what would you do to get the most money out of it?  I will do everything as you say.  I‚Äôm sure I don‚Äôt do even 15% of everything that can be done to monetize a blog.  I was told here that I need to lay out less free and more - for sale.  Maybe you should just donate more, and not free, but for money, and just forget about monetization?  Can search for another affiliate?  Can add contextual advertising?  And how to use your growing rank in Alex to make money on it?  I would add more ads, but so that users do not scatter ... well ... as on your site ... you have a lot of advertising, and nothing, not fatal ... <br><br>  I'm just very poor ... I have no money ... I owe my mother (hmm ..; Misha‚Äôs comment) a few thousand dollars.  I would really like to make more money on my website, because I have invested a lot of work in it, and I will continue to do it with pleasure.  I feel that I am smart enough and technically savvy to make real money on the site ... like others.  Is it at all possible to earn a thousand dollars a month, or two, if properly monetized?  I do not know what exactly to do this. <br>  If you are too busy to answer, can you give a link to a couple of articles that would help me? <br><br>  Respectfully, <br>  Alex Hope " </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/287536/">https://habr.com/ru/post/287536/</a></p>
