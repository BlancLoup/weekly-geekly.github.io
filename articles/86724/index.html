At the moment, I counted <a href="https://www.paypal.com/ru/cgi-bin/webscr%3Fcmd%3D_display-approved-signup-countries-outside">66 countries</a> whose users are entitled to receive money.  As you know, Russia is currently on the list of countries that can only send money. <br>  The other day I conducted a survey on the topic <a href="http://darbin.habrahabr.ru/blog/86578/">‚Äúwhy do you need the ability to accept payments in Paypal‚Äù</a> .  A total of 456 people voted, 73 abstained.  If you leave aside those who ‚Äúuse paypal only for payment‚Äù (90 people) and ‚Äúdo not use paypal at all‚Äù (117 people), then almost <strong>56%</strong> of the remaining 249 people plan to receive payments for services and sales for virtual goods. <br>  Since I have been working with the paypal system for several years and have a fairly large <s>cash</s> personal experience in resolving issues with this <s>evil corporation</s> , I want to share with all the problems that this 56% may face, and any other recipient of money, if paypal makes it possible to receive money Russians. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Introduction </h1><br><ul><li>  To begin with, I will say that all the conditions and rules are for an American account (that is, with the highest possible functions).  Merchant accounts from other countries have far fewer rights. </li><li>  Further, according to the text of the person who can receive payments in paypal, I will call the seller the word, the person who sends the money - the buyer (this is the standard wording paypal: buyer / seller). </li><li>  In the text, all payments that come to the seller‚Äôs account outside the Ebay auction, or other major services that make payments to paypal, i.e., are affected.  I will talk about receiving money directly from other users for services or sales of intangible goods.  To address issues related to the goods sold on Ebay, Ebay itself has recently been involved. </li><li>  I apologize in advance for some possible mistakes in the text - a long stay abroad and the minimal use of the Russian language make themselves felt. </li></ul><br><br><h1>  The buyer is always right. </h1>

If the seller is right, the buyer is always to the right. <br><br>  Do not believe me?  Then look at <a href="https://cms.paypal.com/au/cgi-bin/marketingweb%3Fcmd%3D_render-content%26content_ID%3Dua/BuyerProtComp_full%26locale.x%3Den_AU">PayPal Buyer Protection Policy</a> and <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr%3Fcmd%3Dxpt/Marketing/securitycenter/sell/SellerProtection-outside">Seller Protection</a> .  As they say - feel the difference.  Leave aside the buyer and see what kind of protection the American seller has in paypal (translation of conditions for falling under the definition of "seller protection"). <br><br>  In order to be eligible to be part of a seller protection program, you must meet the following criteria: <br><br>  1. The payment must be marked as fully or partially corresponding to the seller protection program in detail to the payment received. <br>  2. The goods must be shipped within 7 days after receiving the payment exclusively to the address specified in the payment details and must comply with the shipment rules (shipment within 7 days, proof of shipment, proof of receipt - the goods must be received in the same state / city / postal what is the buyer‚Äôs index, and for amounts over $ 250, the buyer must sign for receipt) <br>  3. In cases of opening claims for payment, in due time, fulfill their request and provide all necessary documents and other information regarding this payment. <br>  4. The <strong>goods must be tangible, that is, you must physically send them.</strong> <br>  5. You must be a resident of the country specified in your account. <br><br><img src="http://img9.imageshack.us/img9/6065/paypalsellerprotectiond.png"><br><img src="http://img4.imageshack.us/img4/6351/paypalsellerprotectione.jpg"><br><br><br><br>  Those.  if you do not specify in the details of the payment that it falls under the protection of the rights of sellers (and where this item may appear or not appear in the details for payment is not explained anywhere), if you shipped the goods on day 8 or later and did not take care about the proof of receipt of the goods, at the request of the buyer - they sent the goods not to his address, but to his mom / dad / friend / girlfriend, did not provide all evidence of the dispatch of the goods in a timely manner, or God forbid they sold something virtual and intangible or opened American  th account and now went to live in another country - you will lose your money in the claim by the buyer.  Fun perspective isn't it? <br><br><h3>  Do you think this is all?  Dreaming. </h3><br><br>  In general, the terms of service of the company paypal (paypal terms of service) are so confused that it is almost impossible to fully understand it and even more so on one page to find all the necessary information. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7ee/889/c87/7ee889c876966560d21ac4c1f664b645.jpg"><br><br><br>  That's what else I managed to find on their <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr%3Fcmd%3Dxpt/Marketing/securitycenter/sell/UnauthorizedPaymentProtectionFAQs-outside">website</a> .  It turns out that for users in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, and the United Kingdom, more curtailed vendor protection rules apply (for each country, its own conditions).  And the protection of sellers of other countries who can accept the payment - in general, there is no ( <strong>Seller Protection above</strong> ). <br><br><h3>  Do you think that's all?  Dreamers. </h3><br><br>  We read further that does not cover the protection of the seller. <br>  1. Goods that you personally gave to buy or transferred with someone. <br>  2. <strong>Money received for services, intangible and digital goods</strong> . <br>  3. Claims when the buyer says that the goods received are completely different from those described for the purchase. <br><br>  I think the second point is very "like" those who planned to sell software or receive money for paypal services.  Those.  in fact, the sender of the money can send a complaint about the non-receipt of the goods, and as the <s>seller</s> , you will have nothing to prove <s>to the</s> recipient that you have rendered a service or sold some virtual goods (for example, sold a program, made a design, provided SEO services, sold a domain, etc.) ).  Straight "dream of a lifetime" freelancer. <br><br><h3>  And not even that all. </h3><br><br>  A few more unspoken factors according to which you are not protected as a seller.  I managed to find out these conditions by talking to some paypal employees (not a word in the rules, or they are not given as reasons for deciding to protect the seller, but these conditions also apply). <br><br>  1. Previously, paypal reimbursed only $ 5000 per year for one seller, now this limit has been removed, but unofficially this limit is still valid, or if by some miracle on protection you can recover more than 5000 per year, it will be more difficult to get money over this amount ( will quibble). <br>  2. The buyer's address must be confirmed.  If I specify the status of the buyer‚Äôs address as payment details as not confirmed, then with a probability of 99%, even if you have all the evidence of receipt of the goods at this address, you will lose the dispute. <br>  3. Your account must be verified (verified).  An unverified account as a defendant has a small chance of a positive decision in its favor. <br>  4. If you have a personal account, not a prime minister or a business, then again you may be denied protection of the seller‚Äôs rights with the wording that, according to their rules, a personal account is intended only for personal use.  A personal account implies that you will only make purchases with this account (Personal Account Ideal if you shop online. Make secure payments on eBay and merchant websites using your credit card, debit card, or bank account). <br>  5. If during the proceedings it turns out that you are under 18 years old.  According to their rules, only users older than 18 have the right to open an account. <br>  6. And a bunch of small rules that will allow them not to return the money to you and close your account, the terms of which are scattered throughout their website including such items as - selling illegal goods, selling prohibited goods to minors (alcohol, tobacco, products for adults), incorrect information about yourself in your account, use of an anonymous proxy, if it turns out that you live in a country that is not in the list of countries that are allowed to open accounts at paypal, if you have previously had negative experience with them etc.  etc. <br><br><h2>  Now all ... </h2><br><br>  After the above, you still want to receive money in paypal and believe that you can defend the money received - if the buyer decides to open a claim for a money transfer? <br><br>  <em>PS I generously apologize, I also planned to talk about debts, blocked accounts (and the algorithm by which they block them), about the support, about the <a href="http://paypalsucks.com/">paypal haters</a> project, as well as about other problems that I had to face as a paypal payee, but Oscar begins, and I promised to conduct a live broadcast of the presentation in my forum, so to be continued ...</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86724/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86724/</a></p>
