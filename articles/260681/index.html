    </i>  <i>Since we at RingCloud are developing a virtual PBX, we don‚Äôt feel sorry for sacrificing our brainchild so that you can see what is inside.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/782/855/5a2/7828555a2e2f4bd0ac6d123461606b11.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What we can see from the very beginning, logging in to your personal account is a picture, but it interests us a little, we need it to be convenient and like to users, all the fun is hiding under it.  The main thing is the functions, all that you can and cannot do with a virtual PBX.  And yes, another heart.  Without it, everything is just useless.  This is a phone number.  To revive our child, you need a call.  Then everything will work, and the PBX will begin to function and execute all the commands that you asked her.  After all, she is a robot, an assistant, obedient to you, accurate and impartial. <br>  The interface is like leather or clothing that covers the body of the robot.  Users will not be able, of course, to look into the "holy of holies", - the code, there can only be developers, but we will sort through the bones, with the help of which you will subordinate our PBX to yourself. <br><br>  When you first meet you will see the "face" of the virtual automatic telephone exchange.  The masters worked on this face, and it is very attractive.  The interface shows your position, the client number at RingCloud, the ‚Äúmessages‚Äù button, which shows new and unread letters, the ‚ÄúStore‚Äù button and the ability to leave the program, ‚ÄúExit‚Äù (without it, there is always it). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/247/542/eb6/247542eb6bd74deaa717ac7dca886e99.png" alt="image"><br><br>  So what functions lie inside? <br><br>  Right at the top of the interface you can see the "Status".  This is the health of our assistant, displayed on the monitor.  It shows the workload, the amount of funds in the account, active users, minutes of calls.  A kind of statistics, not only on challenges, but on functioning.  Come and see which of the lines (technical support, sales department, etc.) communicate with customers more and draw conclusions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/89b/421/8d2/89b4218d2b1d41f7afff87c820c91e00.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Under the state is the function "Settings", it is important and includes everything that can be configured.  It is here that you enter information about new employees who will receive calls, and from here you delete them forever.  Here groups are formed according to the directions of interaction with the client.  In this clear structure one can see the place of each. <br>  Immediately, the ‚Äúvoice‚Äù of your company will be born in the settings, the way in which everyone who calls you will hear it.  You can record this voice directly, through peripheral devices, or you can immediately download an audio file. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dba/815/db6/dba815db63b3440bacd7cc5f667f8238.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Below the menu - the "brain", or rather its derivative - "Logic".  But not everyone who has a brain has it, but since it‚Äôs about robots, we‚Äôll assume that they are less susceptible to this deviation.  Logic has no limits.  You have a large field of activity.  You can drag the proposed items into it and build any chains through which the call will ‚Äútravel‚Äù.  Feel yourself a creator, or at least a logical person who thinks about those who will dial the cherished numbers of your number, and they may never even know what care you have done, but will definitely feel it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c80/0f9/c2b/c800f9c2b4074aada4ac7821d32e5721.png" alt="image"><br><br>  If we consider a virtual PBX as an organism, then the next item is rather a fitness tracker, inseparable from the body.  "Statistics".  Any heartbeat (incoming and outgoing calls) will be reflected here.  You can find answers to any and questions, and not only ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow many times a day?‚Äù, But also more advanced.  Statistics can be done the way you want, for this there is a bunch of filters, as well as a field where all the information is displayed in graphs.  Calls, load, directions, external numbers - this is only the tip of the "iceberg" of data.  For each item, you can sort the information additionally.  Is it possible to find the truth in this way, we do not know, but have done everything so that nothing is hidden from you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c6c/208/61e/c6c20861e5964c5cbc790885038a6d56.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Call recording is a ‚Äúgray matter‚Äù where any information is stored.  Just do not force anyone to remember her, because everything is available.  Here is a list of employees, as well as the total amount of files and the filter by date.  Access to this information is always, 24 hours, 7 days a week.  What to do with these records?  What do you want.  To resolve conflicts, listening to the conversation, restore the data that was mentioned on the phone, and then not preserved, to control the quality of service.  And yes!  If customers praise you on the phone, make a general audio file and scroll through it in the company so that everyone knows how to work! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a2b/291/244/a2b2912443c94e41b50b75d42f5bb0ad.png" alt="image"><br><br>  To be continued‚Ä¶ </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/260681/">https://habr.com/ru/post/260681/</a></p>
