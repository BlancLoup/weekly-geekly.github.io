      In this article, we will look at some particularly popular development and testing scenarios in the cloud and the organization of test environments, laboratories and sandboxes for their needs. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Cloud development and testing scenarios </h3><br>  When organizing development and testing in a cloud environment, the following scenarios can be identified. <br><br>  <strong>Sandbox for application development and testing on a supported OS.</strong>  Get on-demand computing power based on Windows Server or Linux, load your own virtual machine images and don't worry about the lack or maintenance of the infrastructure.  Everything is already configured to run your application in a test environment.  Test the application in its special environment and save on the process with per-minute billing and significant discounts on licenses and computing facilities offered to MSDN subscribers. <br><br>  <strong>Quality assurance (Quality Assurance) and application compatibility on new OS, server software.</strong>  In addition to the ability to develop and test an application in an environment for which the application is designed, you can use the cloud to test applications to work with the latest or preliminary versions of operating systems and server software!  Organize continuous testing for the quality and compatibility of your application with new versions of operating systems or servers based on Windowd Server and Linux. <br><br>  <strong>Load testing with real load.</strong>  Do load testing in the cloud without affecting your own infrastructure and the load on your network.  Thanks to the infinite scalability of the cloud, get the opportunity to conduct real, rather than approximate load tests and software testing for unforeseen situations, <br><br>  <strong>Sandbox for developing heavy solutions (SharePoint, SQL Server, BizTalk, AD ...).</strong>  Request and get labs in minutes to test and test the reliability of heavy complex solutions, which can include a SharePoint failover farm, Active Directory domains, high-performance clusters with SQL Server, and so on.  Receive specified servers on demand and low cost, without the need for separate licensing. <br><br>  <strong>Reproduction of the environment and erroneous situations and correction of bugs.</strong>  Get the ability to quickly reproduce any environment of the application at your request for finding, fixing and fixing bugs in the application.  Find the cause, fix the bug, solve the problem and stop using the allocated capacity.  Save on your own infrastructure, paying only for what you consume with per-minute billing in the Windows Azure cloud. <br><br>  <strong>Environment for training, education, software demonstrations.</strong>  Get ready-made environments on demand to support the process of learning new technologies, conducting tests, certification, comprehensive training, laboratory work and software demonstrations in practice in a cloud environment. <br><br>  <strong>Version control systems, bugtracking, incidents, etc.</strong>  Organize control over the software development process in the cloud and save on the purchase, deployment, maintenance and servicing of servers, server software and the environment for the development process in the company.  Deploy your favorite Windows Server or Linux based tools in the cloud and scale them on demand, paying only for the power you really need. <br><br>  <strong>Build modern cloud applications and test them in the cloud.</strong>  Take advantage of dozens of ready-made Windows Azure services ‚Äî from mobile services and web sites to service bus and integration services ‚Äî to build modern scalable cloud applications.  Test cloud applications in your native cloud environment, integrating them with services such as Service Bus, Media Services and BizTalk Services. <br><br><h3>  Patterns of organization development and testing in the Windows Azure cloud </h3><br> <a href=""><img title="image_thumb1" alt="image_thumb1" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/209/320/22a/20932022a4c021db4ece78bfcbf522f4.png" width="850" height="453"></a> <br><br>  This diagram shows a typical development and testing process in the Windows Azure cloud environment: <br><br><ul><li>  create virtual machines in the cloud on demand without waiting; </li><li>  upload your own virtual machine images with the tools available in the company; </li><li>  Easily organize a network connection between servers in the cloud and the local network of the enterprise via VPN; </li><li>  use a single secure mechanism for authorization and access based on your domain; </li><li>  use the same familiar development tools and frameworks to develop applications for both the enterprise and the cloud; </li><li>  Do not worry about accessing regional teams to the test environment or the cloud application development environment - the cloud is accessible from everywhere! </li></ul><br> <a href=""><img title="image_thumb3" alt="image_thumb3" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/099/f7d/e52/099f7de5248fcc741147b591fd558c16.png" width="800" height="423"></a> <br><br>  Using PowerShell administration tools for Windows Azure, in minutes, lift and deploy large and complex projects in the cloud for development, testing, troubleshooting, load testing, and demonstration purposes. <br><br><h3> <a href=""><img title="image_thumb5" alt="image_thumb5" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/75c/526/ab8/75c526ab8f84f01d1f7affe74cf8ca90.png" width="800" height="443"></a> </h3><br><br>  Take advantage of the powerful capabilities of Windows Azure virtual networks to organize networking between enterprise resources and servers in the cloud.  Securely connect all your employees to the cloud, both those behind the corporate firewall and distributed remote workers. <br><br><h3>  useful links </h3><br>  Below you will find links to resources that will help you in using the Microsoft cloud platform: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://bit.ly/15aTMQF">Free 30-day trial of</a> Windows Azure; </li><li>  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/jj950243">Free access</a> to Windows Azure resources for <a href="http://bit.ly/1cHYypt">startups</a> , <a href="http://bit.ly/13hmgdI">partners</a> , teachers, <a href="http://bit.ly/12z1cMA">MSDN subscribers</a> ; </li><li>  Windows Azure <a href="http://www.azurehub.ru/">Development Center</a> (azurehub.ru) - scripts, tutorials, examples, recommendations on the choice of services and development on Windows Azure; </li><li>  News channel <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/AzureRusTV">Windows Azure TV in Russian</a> on YouTube; </li><li>  Latest Windows Azure News - <a href="http://www.twitter.com/windowsazure_ru">Twitter.com/windowsazure_ru</a> ; </li><li>  <a href="http://wazurr.ru/">http://wazurr.ru</a> - content aggregator for Windows Azure in Russian and English. </li></ul><br>  And if you are already developing on Windows Azure or want to find the developers of your service, visit <a href="http://www.appprofessionals.ru/">appprofessionals.ru</a> . <br><br>  We will be happy to answer your questions at <a href="">azurerus@microsoft.com</a> .
