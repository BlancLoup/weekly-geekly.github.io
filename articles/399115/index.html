The reason for such suspicions was the fact that <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/280742/">it was impossible to install Linux</a> on certain notebook models with Windows 10. <br><br>  After a stormy public outcry, Lenovo backed out and <a href="https://liliputing.com/2016/11/lenovo-releases-bios-loading-linux-yoga-900-ideapad-710s-bios.html">released new BIOS firmware</a> for these laptops. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In September, messages appeared on the forums that Linux could not be installed on a number of Lenovo laptops that come with some version of Windows 10 Signature Edition.  According to users, the designation ‚ÄúSignature Edition‚Äù means that Microsoft has an agreement with the manufacturer regarding these computers that the computer is ‚Äúlocked‚Äù to the Windows operating system.  For example, on a Lenovo Yoga 900 ISK2 UltraBook laptop, you cannot install Linux in proprietary RAID mode, which is locked via UEFI / BIOS.

      The investigation <a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/44694.html">revealed</a> that on Intel platforms, the drive is configured in the UEFI / BIOS in two ways: as ‚Äústandard‚Äù or as RAID.  In the second case, the PCI ID identifiers simply change to disable standard drivers and ensure the use of specific Intel drivers that exactly have RAID support.  Intel has not prepared commits to the Linux kernel to support the RAID mode for these drivers, therefore, with these UEFI / BIOS settings, the Linux operating system does not ‚Äúsee‚Äù the drive.  In this case, Lenovo laptops do not have the ability to change the configuration of the drive, it is rigidly installed as a RAID. <br><br>  A Lenovo representative then said that in this case, the laptop has a Signature Edition version of the Windows 10 Home operating system: ‚ÄúIt is locked by our agreement with Microsoft.‚Äù <br><br>  The fact of having some kind of secret agreement was subsequently not confirmed.  Perhaps the problem was precisely in the Intel drivers.  One way or another, Lenovo has finally acknowledged its mistake.  <a href="https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Lenovo-Yoga-Series-Notebooks/Yoga-900-and-Ideapad-710S-Linux-Only-BIOS/tac-p/3473813/highlight/true">New versions of firmware</a> for Yoga 900 and IdeaPad 710 laptops have been published on the official technical support site, which have caused discontent among users. <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/downloads/DS119354" rel="noopener noreferrer">YOGA 900-13ISK2:</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/downloads/DS119355" rel="noopener noreferrer">YOGA 900-13ISK for BIZ</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/downloads/DS119356" rel="noopener noreferrer">YOGA 900S-12ISK</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/downloads/DS119357" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ideapad 710S Plus-13ISK</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/downloads/DS119359" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ideapad 710S-13IKB</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/downloads/DS119360" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ideapad 710S-13ISK</a> </li></ul><br>  In the new BIOS firmware there is an option AHCI, which still allows you to change the mode of the drive and install Linux. <br><br>  True, there is one reservation.  The forum emphasizes that these BIOS versions "are not intended for use on computers running the Windows operating system."  In addition, no official Lenovo support is provided for this BIOS, and all users are warned of the risks of "performance degradation that may be associated with the use of this BIOS." <br><br>  Linux lovers were allowed to install a free operating system, but at their own peril and risk, with the loss of official technical support. <br><br>  Thus, Lenovo has found a way to solve the problem.  After all, if you omit the conspiracy version of a secret agreement with Microsoft, then why did it initially ‚Äúlock‚Äù the BIOS?  In order to eliminate the use of untested Intel drivers that need special settings for power management.  As mentioned above, until recently, Intel did not provide commits to the Linux kernel to support RAID mode for these drivers.  Only on October 21, Intel developers <a href="http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-nvme/2016-October/006800.html">presented the corresponding patch</a> . <br><br>  Lenovo has decided that this will lead to more questions to Lenovo technical support.  The management of the Chinese company decided that the number of Linux users is so small that they can be neglected in order to reduce the number of calls to technical support. <br><br>  After the story became scandalous, they decided to release a new firmware.  But users who install it have been <i>banned from calling technical support</i> .  Everything is simple and logical. <br><br>  Lenovo has a <a href="https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/documents/pd031426">list of laptops</a> that are certified to install Linux, but the Yoga 900 and IdeaPad 710 are still missing from this list. <br><br>  Having installed Linux on Lenovo laptops makes it harder for users to rely on technical support because tech support staff are trained to answer questions primarily on Windows.  In this case, users are deprived of all support.  However, this is not such a big problem - most Linux users do not need advice from the girls from the caliper. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399115/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399115/</a></p>
