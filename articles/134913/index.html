She did not shine, of course, both yesterday and the day before, but today it was somehow particularly disgusting.  Autumn finally felt all its power and sought to show it to people in the form of clouds, rain and wind. <br><br>  Anton did not want to leave the house.  But today was a special day.  Today he was waiting for Work.  He calmly packed up and went right into the veil of city fog.  Anton went and thought about something his.  Those times have long passed when, when he fulfilled an order, he experienced or was tormented by torments of conscience.  In the end, his work was not a crime, although it was the cause of the hatred of many people.  This is just a job and someone has to do it.  He did better than many. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The bridge flashed under his feet, a stream of people poured around Anton, not touching him.  Something in this person unconsciously forced passers-by to take an extra step to the side.  Previously, it seemed to Anton that he was giving out something about his profession, that he had written almost on his forehead who he was - and here, of course, he would have to feel a lot of prickly looks on himself (and maybe not only looks).  But, of course, there was no ‚Äústigma of the leper‚Äù on it.  Simply, people felt the inner strength of this person, his confidence in the loyalty of the chosen path and the determination to follow it to the end. <br><br>  Long in the past there were torments of choice of a profession.  His craft was important and necessary.  Once people did this work themselves or attract workers from related industries to it, but over time the results became unsatisfactory, there were nervous breakdowns among the performers, many of them simply could not sleep at night.  Over time, everyone agreed that this work should be performed by special people who have talent for it and psychological stability.  Such as Anton.  A lot of time passed before this type of activity was finally settled as a separate, although very special profession.  And a lot of time will pass before the human fear in front of it disappears, until the realization of its necessity, an understanding of its undoubted benefit to society, comes.

      All this has long been laid out on the shelves in the head of Anton.  He thought about it a million times and exactly the same time he came to the conclusion that he was doing everything right.  However, another thought occurred to him the same time ‚Äî about the people he would see very soon.  Most of them, most likely, at first will meet him affably, will smile and maybe even joke.  Exactly until the moment they are told who he is and why he came.  At this moment, the smiles will disappear from their faces, the jokes will end.  Someone will be scared, someone will get angry, detachment will descend on someone.  It is possible (although unlikely) that other people will be in front of him - those who will look him straight in the eyes, there will be no fear in them, there will be no lies.  They are well aware that with all of their deeds, their meeting with Anton was predetermined.  Know and ready for this.  Dealing with such people is always ... unusual. <br><br>  Anton straightened the bag, at the same time checking the presence of a working tool in it (although he already knew that he was fine, his weight was well felt) and turned into the lane last on his way.  Another dozen steps - and he is at the right door.  As usual, on time.  As usual, they are waiting for him. <br>  The employer looks confused.  Nothing new - they are always embarrassed.  Someone only for the first time, someone - always.  This current order is clearly the first and to which group it belongs, it is not yet clear.  All right, payment is received, the task is clear and there is no more business to it. <br><br>  A very large room, about two dozen people.  Most of them are young guys.  There are a couple of girls ... Previously, they almost never met in such situations, now more and more often.  Their pity especially.  Someone.  But not to Anton - he had long been accustomed to, that he was somewhere, somewhere, and everyone was equal before him. All these people already know why he is here.  Someone clings to the corner, someone looks like a wolf, someone still does not understand the seriousness of what is happening.  And, of course, their leader.  He stands first, looks down - ready to cover up all of his.  Will not help.  Neither him nor them.  Everyone will get on his business. <br><br>  Anton calmly looked around the room, nodded to the people in front of him, trying to do it without a hint of mockery or superiority, and set to work.  His first words echoed through the hall.  He did not think that he would say - the words were part of a long-known ritual, they were once written on the cover of his first professional textbook and he said them far from the first time: <br>  ‚ÄúWell, let's get down to the Code Review of your project!‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134913/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134913/</a></p>
