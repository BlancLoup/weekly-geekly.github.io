Now we received the latest, most advanced version of the device, which was named AutoFon ‚ÄúD-Beacon‚Äù.  Its purpose is to inform the owner of the location of the car. <br><br>  The fact is that now the technical means used by the hijackers are very diverse.  If the professionals decided to steal some kind of car, then with a probability of 99% they will steal it.  It does not save any alarm or other means of protection against theft.  After it, the most reliable is to find out exactly where the car is.  And AvtoFon "D-Beacon" performs this task, notifying the location of the car. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Main features of AutoFon ‚ÄúD-Beacon‚Äù:

    <ul><li>  Activation according to the schedule for several seconds several times a day (the number of ‚Äúspills‚Äù is adjusted); </li><li>  Sending coordinates by GPRS; </li><li>  Work with a full-fledged, not embedded SIM-card (included; </li><li>  There is an accelerometer; </li><li>  The label is included in the package; </li><li>  There is an external module; </li><li>  Replaceable sealed enclosure. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e8e/7b5/341/e8e7b534106d0d830304c229536a7264.jpg"><br><br>  Now - a little more about all this.  As for the SIM-card, it is worth saying that it is already included in the package.  In previous versions of ‚ÄúAutophone‚Äù there is no slot for SIM, all data is embedded in the chip. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e78/e16/123/e78e1612392bab9525202645ad229825.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/267/eb7/fc4/267eb7fc458c05748dd7ae436159e000.jpg"><br><br>  The accelerometer helps the device to understand whether the car is moving (or any other device, an object to which the system is attached).  If the movement began at an unexpected moment (the owner is in the store, and the car has gone), then a notification is sent. <br><br>  In addition, a label is also used to improve security.  "Autophone" always checks for the presence of a label nearby.  If she suddenly disappears, the owner receives a message via SMS.  ‚ÄúAutophone‚Äù can be installed not only in a car, but also attached to other objects, for example, to baggage, motorcycle, bicycle, container with cargo, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/37d/415/3ae/37d4153ae03bcd2b804f7fdacd63a6e9.jpg"><br><br>  An external module can be used to extend the functionality of the main module.  You can, for example, connect an external signal source or additional power. <br><br>  Sealed housing allows you to place all the components of the module, protecting them from moisture.  This option should be used with an external installation of "AutoPhone" <br><br>  Equipment: <br><br>  - Device AutoFon D-Beacon - 1 pc. <br>  - Lithium battery CR 123A - 2 pcs. <br>  - User Guide - 1 pc. <br>  - A brief reminder to the owner on a plastic card - 1 pc. <br>  - Packaging box - 1 pc. <br>  - Double-sided adhesive tape - 1 pc. <br>  - Payment of external power supply and extensions with cable - 1 pc. <br>  - Heat-resistant SIM ‚Äì card with a special tariff - 1 pc. <br>  - Radio tag with battery - 1 pc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f6c/846/8e4/f6c8468e49f665d1246ae6de2b5fc9ca.jpg"><br><br><h3>  How to get started </h3><br>  Initially, you need to activate the SIM card (if you decide to use your personal SIM card).  To do this, make a call to a short number.  Then be sure to disable the PIN. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/382/321/8af/3823218af54867dfab38ce2eb57e26a3.jpg"><br><br>  The second step is to install the batteries into the device case, after which the beacon starts working.  In addition, you need to perform several more operations, sending several SMS to a certain number.  This will allow you to record the owner's number for notifications, change the system access password, translate the SMS format into English, which will save on Cyrillic SMS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/abd/a0a/7c5/abda0a7c5c38ce1204cba5574c3f7be8.jpg"><br><br>  After the setup is completed, we send an SMS to a short number, having received the ‚ÄúAutophone‚Äù configuration in a reply message. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e73/9f4/d28/e739f4d28bb31b767463aa201d068aa1.jpg"><br><br>  The message is quite informative.  Here you can see the current password, settings, check synchronization with the label and battery.  It also shows the number of specified activations per day, sending SMS options, setting the sensitivity level of the motion sensor, battery level and temperature in the device. <br><br>  In the basic mode, you can see the beacon information, including the coordinates of the base towers, the activation time and the battery charge level.  If necessary, you can send additional commands to change the settings.  It is best to configure the device immediately, even before installation in the machine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/97f/e17/652/97fe1765298e555d8d85a93378a54fd8.jpg"><br><br>  When installing it is worth remembering that the device is better to install the inscription "Autophone" up, it is very desirable to place the device where there is less metal.  The range of the label is about 3 meters, it is better to check work with it in advance. <br><br>  In the basic functionality mode, the device will send a control SMS from the ‚ÄúAutophone‚Äù to the pre-set number once every two weeks.  This message is sent so that the owner of the car understands that the device is working, and also can monitor the level of battery charge and other parameters.  There will be enough batteries for 2 years of work of "Avtofon". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/457/2cf/7c7/4572cf7c73e56a38076a6b72eb99fc65.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Hijacked </h3><br>  If THAT happened, you immediately need to send an SMS of the following format to our device number: password, T1-30m, G. Additional parameters allow switching the activation alarm to the operation mode every half hour, with receiving GPS / GLONASS coordinates at each activation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3fb/767/a5a/3fb767a5adb5441ced3df3d8ec20dbb1.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, an interesting feature of the interaction of the main module with the label.  To check for its presence, Avtofon sends requests while in sleep mode.  If the label is not found, the device wakes up and begins to conduct operational investigative work. <br><br><h3>  Configuration option </h3><br>  We connect the device to the battery via an external module.  In case of battery disconnection or its discharge, the device will work autonomously. <br><br>  We connect the device to the standard alarm siren.  If something happens, the alarm is now triggered, and the user receives an SMS about the incident. <br><br>  We connect the label.  In this case, Avtofon will respond to movement in the absence of the owner. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e01/adb/607/e01adb607d6e41f8e9dcfb536d00cef0.jpg"><br><br>  <b>The advantages of the system:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  a unique combination of GPS tracker and GPS passive beacon (user setting); </li><li>  unique non-volatility in the passive mode; </li><li>  very well protected digital radio channel between the label and the main unit; </li><li>  availability of modifications for motorcycles (sealing the device to protect against environmental influences); </li><li>  completing a special thermally protected SIM-card, which increases the reliability of the ‚ÄúAvtoFon‚Äù. </li></ul><br>  For Geektimes readers, we offer a 10% discount on AvtoFon using the <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/avto-moto-velo/autofon/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Dautofon%26utm_content%3Dautofon%26utm_campaign%3Dautofon_328">GEEKT-DM</a> code. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4hN2juuHqmY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <b>As well as information for bloggers and authors:</b> <br>  The company "Dadzhet" is interested in publishing independent objective reviews of dadzhetov in various kinds of media.
