It is not enough just to draw wings to the car and announce that in 15 years all the vehicles will become unmanned.  How will the future, built on communication with IoT in the overall ecosystem of a smart city, be reflected in the appearance of the car?  Is at least someone capable of laying the foundations of the future transport systems of the future, or should we be content with designers' abstract fantasies, while the real market pioneers (for example, Tesla) are in no hurry to share their promising developments? </p><br><p>  We will look for answers to these questions in our conceptually futuristic compilation.  The majority of the presented promising developments are planned to be implemented in series, leaving no ‚Äúfuture cars‚Äù in the form of exhibits. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="moto-mashina">  Moto car </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3bf/d3e/f55/3bfd3ef555fe48049475dd54ab5c82e2.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  Three-wheeled <a href="https://auto.mail.ru/article/64071-toyota_pokazala_ubiicu_malolitrazhek/">Toyota i-TRIL</a> , in which the seats for passengers are arranged in such a way as to provide fellow travelers with the best possible view.  When the electric motor starts and stops, the rear seats turn 90‚Å∞, making it easier to get in and out.  The machine is controlled by two joysticks, and the secondary functions are set by voice.  In addition, the car cornering can bend like a motorcycle. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d7f/862/eef/d7f862eefeff447ba0140eaa78dd372e.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  Trike <a href="https://auto.mail.ru/article/64057-pendo-tracto_gibridnyi_to_li_motocikl_to_li_traktor/">Pendo-Tracto</a> - a three-wheeled vehicle, immediately resembling a motorcycle.  Pendo-Tracto is driven by a front wheel and can carry up to three people. </p><br><h2 id="letayuschiy-avtomobil">  Flying car </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2fe/3f4/826/2fe3f4826f5240faa47bbda4d2ad0875.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  A few years ago, the AeroMobil prototype was introduced, which at the moment has become a model of a flying car that is almost ready for commercial use.  And now other manufacturers began to catch up.  The French aviators from Airbus, world-famous for their planes, <a href="https://auto.mail.ru/article/64094-zheneva-2017_model_pop_ap_nauchit_avtomobili_letat/">decided to take up</a> cars, but not simple, but also those who know how to fly.  The car can autonomously move both on four wheels, and on propellers, presented as a separate drone. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/52d/e6a/5d3/52de6a5d379641d6b9bf660fc11d148b.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  On the road, the passenger compartment comes unfastened from the propellers and joins the wheeled platform, and, if necessary, is installed on railroad autonomous trains.  The size of the drone is 5 by 4.4 m. Both the ground and air transport modules are equipped with a full autopilot. </p><br><h2 id="gonochnye-mashiny">  Race cars </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a5a/2ad/005/a5a2ad0054824be0b96c4cbedb62cbe1.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  Designer Thomas Belkhatsen <a href="https://auto.mail.ru/article/61507-avtomobil_budushchego_dodge_on_mog_by_byt_takim/">showed</a> his vision of a miniature sports car.  The control of the Osis machine varies depending on traffic conditions, the road and the surrounding landscape.  The car received a fully removable body panels, which are presented in different colors, like removable cases for the phone.  Osis reflects the trend of trying to make at least partially a DIY machine using a variety of replacement parts. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/255/883/3c2/2558833c2446435ab359e31e5f16eff3.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  Electric <a href="https://www.ff.com/en/our-company/ffzero1concept/">car Faraday Future FFZERO1</a> with acceleration from zero to 100 km / h in three seconds.

The modular architecture allows you to build such cars with front or rear wheel drive, as well as the use of all-wheel drive system. </p><br><h2 id="ekotehnika">  Ekotehnika </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/569/219/175/569219175d234e26ab2742c2f3c9d22b.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  The <a href="https://auto.mail.ru/article/64046-predstavlen_avtomobil_kotoryi_mozhet_vyrastit_derevo/">Rinspeed Oasis</a> concept allows you to grow plants inside yourself - yes, inside there are two chairs, a wooden floor, a front panel with large screens and a flower bed with indoor plants.  The garden is located under the windshield of the car and is designed to generate fresh air in the car. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/22a/b3e/6f6/22ab3e6f684f45979f2a941cf87168b9.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  In addition, the car is very "sociable": it <a href="http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-detroit-motor-show/futuristic-rinspeed-oasis-detroit-new-pics-driverless">can greet the</a> driver or write to the pedestrian that he can cross the road. </p><br><h2 id="nosilki-dlya-botov">  Boot stretcher </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/585/fc8/107/585fc810776d40e5967930c464d9baac.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  Mercedes-Benz showed the <a href="https://auto.mail.ru/article/63575-mercedes_sozdal_idealnyi_avtomobil_dlya_pochtalona/">Vision Van</a> concept - a small-tonnage carrier project, in the back of which a smart cargo sorting system is mounted: it chooses and puts forward the necessary cargo for unloading when the van arrives at the address.  A parcel with a weight of up to two kilograms can be delivered by a wheeled eight wheel drones with a radius of 10 km.  Soon, testing of both the truck and the drones will begin. </p><br><h2 id="bespilotniki">  UAVs </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e35/78a/3d0/e3578a3d02a047aea5f0923e07a36fc9.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  Not just drones, but inhumans.  The Russian company Volgabus has developed a <a href="https://auto.mail.ru/article/61512-proekt_matreshka_v_rossii_gotovyat_celuyu_gammu_bespilotnikov/">project for a</a> future family of commercial unmanned vehicles.  At the heart of their idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmodular transport is a single basic platform.  During operation, you can not only change the purpose of the car (for example, make a bus from a truck), but also drive a fully charged cart under the desired transport module instead of the one where the battery has sat down. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a7c/e64/419/a7ce644195e1497f98d28536d219c814.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  MATRSHKA (as the authors of the project called it) is not just a concept.  The first finished prototype is now being run in Skolkovo, the second is sent for ground testing, and three more machines are at the assembly stage. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/432/c55/92a/432c5592ab2e4f1a87ca80540ac1cf59.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  Something similar is being done jointly by KAMAZ and the Central Research Automotive and Automotive Institute NAMI.  ‚ÄúShuttle‚Äù (the original name with one ‚Äút‚Äù) is an unmanned minibus for 12 people (including six seats), which should take you to your destination in the city.  A large number of these machines can replace the usual public transport.  The first prototypes of the Shuttle are already driving in unmanned mode - for this purpose, radars, cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and a central processor are hidden in the outlines of the body.  The maximum speed is currently limited to 25 km / h.  "Shuttle" can be full or monoprivodnom. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0a1/731/089/0a17310896ad4cd0a5116251c1907444.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  Volkswagen showed a completely unmanned <a href="https://auto.mail.ru/article/64052-nemeckaya_buhanka_volkswagen_pokazal_koncept_bespilotnika/">Sedric</a> ("self-driving car"), the appearance of which on the roads should be expected closer to 2025.  Electric batteries that drive the Sedric are located in the floor of the electric vehicle.  A windshield Sedric, if desired, can be turned into one big screen.  The car also for some reason got a small greenhouse where you can grow plants. </p><br><h2 id="dalekoe-buduschee">  Far future </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b9e/117/fc6/b9e117fc60e0489e8e375660637baa90.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  Rolls-Royce showed a concept car with square wheel arches, which is expected to enter the series no earlier than 2040.  Nevertheless, the concept has at least a prototype with interesting details: one door, vertically rising roof, a sofa in the cabin. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/70d/3e1/1d9/70d3e11d9f844f0aad61e53426ee11dd.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  The luggage is placed in a special compartment on the side of the car, followed by the front wheel.  A 360‚Å∞ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dq7gygumHoos">video was</a> also released, which allows you to be inside the car using a smartphone and virtual glasses. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d1f/daf/374/d1fdaf3742784f0082e4b335b59fd519.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  Renault to the Paris Motor Show was not too lazy <a href="https://auto.mail.ru/article/62371-renault_predstavila_krutoe_sportkupe/">to build a</a> futuristic coupe Trezor.  The car is equipped with two batteries with independent cooling systems, optimized air intakes with variable geometry. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/07b/983/df8/07b983df8e494585a770b44ee44bd6c9.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  There are no doors at Renault Tresor - the top of the car, made of carbon fiber, opens like a cabin in combat aircraft.  Renault Tresor will be able to drive offline, hiding the steering wheel inside the panel to provide the driver with a beautiful panoramic view. </p><br><h2 id="smart-kompakt">  Smart Compact </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f4a/379/625/f4a3796256df4827b4bbca6c84d2cc6a.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  Chinese startup NIO <a href="http://mashable.com/2017/03/12/nio-eve-self-driving-electric-car-concept/%3Futm_cid%3Dmash-com-Tw-main-link">demonstrated the concept of an</a> electric EVE drone, equipped with a comfortable cabin, in which you can even sleep.  Chairs inside the car are laid out in full-fledged sofas, there is a folding table and compartments for storing personal belongings - everything is done to ensure that passengers completely relax and trust the car. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c6/b77/db0/1c6b77db0687498e86621d3080fd895b.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p> After all, the salon is a 6-seater lounge area.  Instead of glasses - interactive screens that display information from on-board computers.  The Chinese declare their readiness to start the car in the series by 2020. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac6/b37/121/ac6b3712172749d29cf391574587d20c.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://www.topgear.com/car-news/concept/ces-2017-honda-neuv-brain-wheels">Honda NeuV</a> is a self- <a href="https://www.topgear.com/car-news/concept/ces-2017-honda-neuv-brain-wheels">driving</a> electric vehicle that determines the passenger / driver emotions and adjusts the driving style based on the data obtained.  The first prototype of the machine has already been built, but there is no ready software yet. </p><br><hr><br><p>  Cars that "don't look like anything" are increasingly similar to each other.  Automakers tend to surprise not design (the exterior presented in the review of "loaves" is not very impressive), and make an interesting "vehicle".  The main characteristics are not speed or range, but the ability to adapt to the character of the owner, to provide him with maximum comfort, to provide information about the shortest route, to meet the increased environmental requirements.  It is possible that soon ‚Äúa car for racing‚Äù in certain markets will be the lot of aesthetes, and for the mass buyer cars will finally turn into an element of a comfortable public infrastructure. </p></div>
