We have already uploaded YouTube videos of HolyJS 2018 Piter reports on YouTube, and made for you (not quite) the traditional selection of the best of them according to the conference visitors. <br><br>  As usual, the top ‚Äújunior‚Äù reports, in the end - with the highest rating.  Of course, this does not mean that one report is much worse than another: assessments of the entire collection in the range from 4.28 to 4.56.  If you look at the number of reviews, or change the method of calculation, places can easily change.  In general, look at everything!

Today we have not 10, but 11 reports, and there are several reasons for this. <br><br>  First, between the 11th and 10th place, the difference is only four hundredths of a point.  Secondly, initially the guys from the ‚ÄúYandex speed group‚Äù planned to make a pair report, and then they were divided: Andrei ( <a href="https://habr.com/users/andre_487/" class="user_link">Andre_487</a> ) told about online, and Alexey about offline measurements.  So, for the sake of completeness, both were included in the top: you can consider them to be two parts of a whole. <br><br>  This is an excellent report to start our selection - it is simple, dynamic, but at the same time useful.  It will help to come up with metrics and understand the speed of the product, doing some things literally on the knee and without unnecessary analytics. <br><br>  As one of the conference attendees put it: ‚ÄúCI on steroids with these guys!‚Äù. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Bringing mobile web back to life </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Imad Elyafi</b> <br>  Location: 10 <br>  Rating: 4.28 ¬± 0.12 <br>  <a href="https://downloads.ctfassets.net/nn534z2fqr9f/6LFlknbgTCgSW62oI62oOk/65402561639582669a23c372a183435b/Imad_Elyafi_Bringing_Mobile_Web_Back_to_Life.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iQLwbBOYabo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Imad's report from Pinterest on how in 11 weeks (successfully!) To rewrite the mobile web version of such a large project like Pinterest, having received an increase in user engagement metrics.  The result - the result is close to native applications without loss in load speed. <br><br>  Of course, the path was thorny and difficult - Imad used examples to tell where they had to deal with problems and how they were solved.  He will explain why the team chose the mobile version, the work on the start page and how the site was optimized for a 3G connection without losing synchronization. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Debugging JS on the example of Chrome DevTools </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Alexey Kozyatinsky</b> <br>  Location: 9 <br>  Rating: 4.28 ¬± 0.08 <br>  <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/nn534z2fqr9f/4xMrdqUlTGsua0QwUig0QS/386536648d0bd671ee4894eb4e6cec34/Aleksey_Kozyatinskiy_JavaScript_debugger.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kBHUEFYawTk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The main topic of the report is what is inside the web application debugger.  Alexey works ‚Äúon the other side of the barricades‚Äù - in the Chrome DevTools team, creating and improving JavaScript debugging tools there.  The report will discuss just this: what the browser can do automatically when debugging, what tools are developer's friends, how to work with asynchronous stacks and memory profiling. <br><br>  And in the report, Alexey answers the question why brendpoints in sourcemap files work only after reloading the page and counterpose sampling and instrumentation, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each. <br><br>  The report is short, but detailed: there are a lot of analysis of tools, a lot of code and promises to fix bugs :) <br><br><hr><br><h2>  A systematic approach to front-end speed: offline measurements </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Alexey Kalmakov</b> <br>  Location: 8 <br>  Rating: 4.29 ¬± 0.08 <br>  <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/nn534z2fqr9f/gYzskQG7cIMEcwq4qU6MS/6a16289ec84f6b22298e7450e32bc045/Alexey_Kalmakov_offline_measurements.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TzCMDlYMydA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The second part of the report on the approach to measurements from the guys from Yandex.  Now, about offline measurements: completely different approaches, and other information perfect.  It is best to look at both parts in order to understand what is happening and how to apply knowledge outside the internal tools of Yandex. <br><br>  Alexey reveals the pros and cons of his colleague's approach, and tells about the sad story of one release, about the Pulse tool, which helps to collect data and requests and highlights the main problems of offline data collection.  Easy, fun and useful report. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Keynout: 30: Too much javascript </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Ilya Klimov</b> <br>  Location: 7 <br>  Rating: 4.30 ¬± 0.08 <br>  <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/nn534z2fqr9f/5atzdSm2BaQiiE4K8YSkyk/0223bac6e570274836e9b47ac9d148c9/Illya_Klymov_30_2.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZCQuIV4sftI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The final motivational keynote turned out to be very ‚Äúeasy‚Äù, lively, and quite humorous.  At a minimum, it‚Äôs worth a look for the categorization of training.  Ilya made a capacious graph of the importance and relevance of knowledge, which our listeners really liked. <br><br>  This report is the answer to three questions asked by Ilya every week several times by his students: <br><br><ul><li>  How to learn what you need, but not HYIP </li><li>  How to structure information for the fastest mastering? </li><li>  Where to run? </li></ul><br><br><hr><br><h2>  Keynout: Flickering Technology, or 21st Century Engineering </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Maxim Yuzva</b> <br>  Location: 6 <br>  Rating: 4.41 ¬± 0.07 <br>  <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/nn534z2fqr9f/3t7RLg6CIg0w8k6myekMwu/8a9832d378568ebe478c6c8b9b6ed084/Yuzva_technology_flashing_.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MzTng78DCm4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  If the code does not argue, does not ask unnecessary questions (well, almost), and you do not need to negotiate with it, then everything is much more complicated with people - everyone has their own quirks, needs, and so on.  This is the report of Maxim in the style of TED, which became the end of the first day. <br><br>  Maxim examines that part of the work that is outside of holivars about frameworks, paradigms and outside of eternal front-fender fuss.  For example, the participants noted helpful tips on how to choose technologies, ask questions correctly and interact in a team. <br><br>  Maxim teaches to sell refactoring on a project, convince colleagues to implement Linter and stop bathing, what to write, Angular, React or Vue. <br><br>  This report will answer the question: ‚ÄúWould Ilon Musk be able to launch and land a rocket if he knew JavaScript, React or Angular the best in the world?‚Äù Spoiler: ‚ÄúYes.  But knowledge of js is not the main thing here. ‚Äù  After all, you need to download softskilz, be able to communicate in a team, to prove their point of view and much more.  You can write code perfectly, but in a discussion you lose to someone who has a well-hung language.  And this must be remembered. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Decompose Main Thread into Node.js to increase throughput </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Nikolay Matvienko</b> <br>  Location: 5 <br>  Rating: 4.42 ¬± 0.09 <br>  <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/nn534z2fqr9f/3xtKFHSuissgAqMIMmaQ4w/52e391982259a4244a231cb8a5460dc6/Nikolay_Matvienko_Decomposition_of_the_Main_Thread.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mfz1_blLl9Q" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Each company uses Node.js in its own way: from style building, SSR and templating to microservices and communication with databases.  But one thing unites everyone - the loaded Main Thread.  Nikolay, on the example of Node.js implementation in large enterprise e-commerce projects, tells how to efficiently and gradually unload the Main Thread so as to increase throughput. <br><br>  There are many tools for this - making logging in a separate thread, collecting metrics in a separate process, launching workers to work with the most resource-intensive tasks. <br><br>  Tests, specific comparison figures, graphs ‚Äî Nikolay analyzes each tool in detail and with intelligence.  A harsh, but very useful report that is not recommended to be missed. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  We work with abstract syntax trees of JavaScript </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Kirill Cherkashin</b> <br>  Location: 4 <br>  Rating: 4.44 ¬± 0.07 <br>  <a href="https://codelab.fun/ast/intro">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ILSpvViUlPU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Kirill, who was born in Moscow, now lives in New York and works at Google on Firebase, and also <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ru-RU/AngularNYC/members/14429094/">organizes the</a> largest Angular-metap in the world.  He talks in simple and ‚Äúpainful‚Äù examples about how to correctly analyze your code and transform someone else‚Äôs. <br><br>  Why do you need to parse your code?  For example, in order to find the forgotten console.log before the commit.  And what if you need to change the function signature in hundreds of entries in the code?  Can regular expressions handle this? <br><br>  Kirill answers all these questions in his simple but very useful report.  He explores approaches to the analysis and transformation of the source JavaScript-code, based on its parsing and work with the resulting Abstract Syntax Tree.  Babel and ESLint are used as examples. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Eme?  CDM?  DRM?  CENC?  IDK! </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Sebastian Golasch</b> <br>  Location: 3 <br>  Rating: 4.46 ¬± 0.17 <br><br>  <a href="https://downloads.ctfassets.net/nn534z2fqr9f/3cee4odqrCyuUqm6YYC8Ga/bf153bf0e98e15307326ecfbe225994f/Sebastian_Golasch_-_EME__CDM__DRM__CENC__IDK_.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Y3R_snaDDc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  A three-word talk - Netflix reverse engineering! <br>  A very interesting report that reveals the technical details behind a number of terrible abbreviations of the DRM stack: EME (Encrypted Media Extension), CDM (Content Decryption Modules), Widevine, and DRM (Digital Rights Management). <br><br>  For one report, Sebastian will cover the main points related to the protection of online video: streaming, downloading, protection against piracy, licensing and many others.  He will tell you how to create your own video player for Netflix and delve into the architecture of the service. <br><br>  A report full of technical details, which may not suit everyone, but either introduces the basics of working with DRM, or prompts something useful to those who are faced with the work of streaming services every day. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Dirty little tricks from the dark corners of eCommerce </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Vitaly Friedman</b> <br>  Location: 2 <br>  Rating: 4.51 ¬± 0.11 <br>  <a href="https://downloads.ctfassets.net/nn534z2fqr9f/2sw2xzK7c8qeW4UeW6ugsC/c12e156572aaf355308dcd5d0a89e3f8/holy-dirty-little-tricks.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/budMyJhNppQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Vitali is a person who just talks about the important.  For example, what can go wrong in an eCommerce project. <br><br>  Yes, problems can arise literally everywhere: from choosing a product and adding it to the basket to a confirmation letter and, in fact, the delivery of goods.  Each step should be carefully checked for possible errors and misunderstandings. <br><br>  In the report, Vitali shows a huge number of examples of how they do badly in eCommerce (for conversion or in relation to users), with real examples and corporate humor. <br><br>  In this report, Vitali will consider how you can increase the conversion, as well as simply improve the user experience with the help of some little things.  As usual - Vitaly's report is beautiful, simple (despite the English language), and is very useful both to UX-designers and developers. <br><br>  A lot of positive feedback from visitors say one thing - each listener and the viewer will find something useful in the Vitaly report. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Keynout: New Adventures in frontend, Season 2 </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Vitaly Friedman</b> <br>  Location: 1 <br>  Rating: 4.56 ¬± 0.05 <br>  <a href="https://downloads.ctfassets.net/nn534z2fqr9f/258nBVG8gIoqgU6Gc2ymGQ/321f64509d556f34ebc8a050e1b90891/holyjs-opening.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wuTPzW6aK0Q" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  ‚ÄúBut I didn‚Äôt guess, I‚Äôm buzzing in both ears!‚Äù In general, if you tried to guess Vitaly Friedman‚Äôs place because of the opening picture post, you could hardly guess that he managed to take the top two positions at once. <br><br>  If one of the most notable speeches of the previous HolyJS was Vitaly Friedman‚Äôs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DrgHLV2fe-2I">report</a> ‚ÄúNew Adventures in Responsive Web Design‚Äù, then his ‚Äúsequel‚Äù was the best at HolyJS Piter 2018! <br><br>  When you lead Smashing Magazine, you will learn a lot of front-end subtleties, difficulties and dirty tricks - so the report will touch on a variety of topics.  As the author warns, "you will not be able to" discern back "what you will learn, and we are not responsible for your subsequent nightmares."  As one listener said: ‚ÄúAcrobatic stunts will always come in handy for optimizing the work of the frontend!‚Äù.  We can not disagree. <br><blockquote>  If these reports (and others from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPL8sJahqnzh8KeXLLPIasdrnqMy-JkTGVM">full playlist</a> ) are interested, pay attention: <b><a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/">HolyJS Moscow 2018</a> will take place on November 24-25</b> . <br><br>  The most up-to-date information about the program can always be seen on the website, you can also buy tickets there - and from November 1, their price will rise to the final, so now is the last opportunity to save. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428085/">https://habr.com/ru/post/428085/</a></p>
