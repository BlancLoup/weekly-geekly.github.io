NetApp today offers its customers a range of solutions of the Cloud-Integrated Storage class of the AltaVault family. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d8a/003/0f9/d8a0030f9cd24a7a89d06b7228899a1d.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf7/743/415/cf774341518f4033aec9bf3bd1fec6ef.png"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <br>
      First, on the reasons why modern enterprises are no longer satisfied with inherited backup and data recovery systems of the on-premise class (located on the local site of the enterprise itself). <br><br>  <b>1. They are too slow</b> .  Users always expect instant recovery and minimal data loss, but legacy backup and recovery strategies no longer keep up with the times. <br><br>  <b>2. They are too expensive</b> .  Volumes of critical corporate data are growing rapidly.  Companies use all available means to struggle with the increasing cost of data protection in their on-premise systems.  In addition, as data volumes grow, the costs of providing the necessary bandwidth and combating other constraints are becoming more and more significant. <br><br>  <b>3. They are subject to too many risks</b> .  Many organizations still rely on tape storage systems.  This approach seems to be imperfect today because of the potential risks of losing some of the data during write-restore, the relatively large downtime of tape systems, and their limited ability to test. <br><br>  <b>4. They are too complicated</b> .  The number of critical enterprise applications that need protection is also increasing.  Increases the complexity of the backup architecture for numerous applications.  Inherited technologies are also prone to error accumulation.  Therefore, traditional local backup systems become unnecessarily complex. <br><br>  <b>How AltaVault Solves Backup, Backup and Restore Issues</b> <br><br>  NetApp AltaVault (formerly SteelStore) provides enterprises with reliable and secure backups in the cloud of any type and any provider, while reducing costs by up to 90% compared to local solutions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e06/c72/658/e06c726584364285bd004a6ce85d0ba7.png"><br>  <i>Constructive physical device AVA 400/800</i> <br><br>  AltaVault gives customers the ability to take full advantage of the cloud economy while protecting their already made investments in corporate backup infrastructure and complying with agreements on the quality of backup and recovery services (Service Level Agreements, SLAs). <br><br>  <b>How AltaVault Efficiency Is Ensured</b> <br><br>  <b>Due to the best in the data compression industry</b> .  AltaVault uses on-the-fly deduplication and compression, which provides data compression of up to 30: 1.  This means that the enterprise stores less data in the cloud in real volume and can move it faster. <br><br>  <b>By optimizing the network and the cloud</b> .  Built-in WAN optimization reduces the amount of transported data, which speeds up the time of data exchange with the cloud up to four times.  Thus, AltaVault intelligently squeezes traffic even more, which saves money and time.  At the same time, the specified quality of services (Quality of Services, QoS) ensures that the data moves to / from the cloud at the speed required by the business. <br><br>  <b>Due to the rapid data recovery</b> .  AltaVault improves recoverability, since 95% of the data remains in the local cache.  With its intelligent prefetching, AltaVault recovers data from the cloud within minutes.  So, with AltaVault, customers can recover their data up to 32 times faster than with tape drives. <br><br>  Using NetApp AltaVault gives businesses the following benefits. <br><br>  <b>1. Corporate scaling on an open platform</b> <br><br>  <b>Flexible deployment and scaling</b> .  The client chooses the most appropriate deployment option - cloud (Azure, AWS, etc.) virtual (VMware, Hyper-V, etc.) or physical (AVA). <br><br>  The AltaVault family of devices starts with just 2 TB (the youngest virtual model AVA-v2) and expands to 57 PB (the older physical model AVA-800) protected data in the cloud.  This makes AltaVault solutions the most scalable, integrated with the cloud data storage (cloud-integrated storage) on the market. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9e4/a16/736/9e4a16736e5c4f109939c3955f706031.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/735/cfc/af3/735cfcaf35d2408d968e46ac6f834a85.png"><br>  <i>Technical Specifications in Backup Mode</i> <i><br><br></i> <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3f9/f6b/6be/3f9f6b6be8a34d66ae92c2139ee11a84.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fd5/0af/614/fd50af6149064e8da44045cbdd9eefef.png"><br>  <i>Cold Storage Technical Specs</i> <br><br>  <b>2. Deduplication, compression and encryption</b> <br><br>  NetApp AltaVault provides seamless integration of used enterprise applications and cloud services provided by providers. <br><br>  <b>Compatible with existing backup software</b> .  AltaVault-based solutions are compatible with all leading backup and archive software products, including EMC, Symantec, IBM and Commvault.  Enterprises do not waste time on eliminating gaps and replacing software, as well as on retraining IT-staff. <br><br>  <b>The choice of the cloud and agility</b> .  A client may prefer any cloud, since AltaVault usually supports it.  AltaVault today supports 95% of the leading cloud providers and platforms that are on the market.  Cloud providers appear and disappear, and businesses do not want to be tied to any one of them.  The versatility of AltaVault eliminates dependence on a single provider. <br><br>  <b>3. ‚ÄúArmored‚Äù safety and regulatory compliance (compliance)</b> <br><br>  <b>Encryption and Compliance</b> .  Data is encrypted and secure in all cases - on every device and during traffic.  Typically, 256-bit AES encryption is used, compliant with the latest FIPS 140-2 Level 1 specification and TLS encryption industry standard.  Encryption keys can be managed locally using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_Management_Interoperability_Protocol">KMIP</a> protocol - and, in fact, never leave your own information center. <br><br>  <b>Manage data access</b> .  Enterprise employees can access data in AltaVault in accordance with role-based access control and integration with Terminal Access Controller Access Control System (TACACS) and Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS).  To do this, use the appropriate access control lists, giving users and service personnel access to certain protocols, ports and networks. <br><br>  <b>Reduced recovery time and data loss</b> .  Reduction of recovery time (Recovery Time Objective, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recovery_time_objective">RTO</a> ) is achieved by using the local AltaVault cache. <br><br>  <b>Emergency preparedness</b> .  The time and order of restoring local workloads is determined during system tests for recovery or based on AWS / Azure capabilities when working with AltaVault. <br><br>  <b>4. The easiest deployment and management</b> <br><br>  <b>Faster deployment</b> .  A system based on AltaVault can typically be started in less than 30 minutes.  The whole process is reduced to three simple steps, after which you can start sending data to the cloud in working mode. <br><br>  <b>More "smart" management</b> .  AltaVault is focused on reducing the time needed to work with tape drives and tasks requiring manual control, which are error prone and time consuming.  Remote control and monitoring are summarized in a dashboard (dashboard) with the appropriate GUI and provide full control of administrators, regardless of where they are physically located - anywhere in their enterprise, or in any part of the world where there is an Internet channel. <br><br>  <b>World-class service and support</b> .  Professional services from NetApp and its partners relate both to the infrastructure built on the basis of the company's solutions and to a heterogeneous environment.  It provides an optimized solution that meets the specific needs of the enterprise.  The support service helps the client achieve continuous operations, operational excellence (operational excellence), and cost efficiency. <br><br>  <b>5. AltaVault lowers cloud entry barriers.</b> <br><br>  Many organizations enthusiastically take over the cloud economy, but rather soon face several obstacles.  AltaVault, as a cloud-integrated storage appliance, was originally designed to help customers break through these barriers. <br><br>  <b>Support security and compliance in a multi-provider environment</b> .  Organizations cannot risk their data or their customer data.  NetApp AltaVault is designed to meet your cloud strategy ‚Äî securely protecting data and meeting security requirements. <br><br>  <b>Simple management of large amounts of data, even with limited bandwidth</b> .  In one example, AltaVault deduplication reduced the volume of construction company data downloaded to the cloud almost six times, from 39 TB to 7 TB, and all data was transferred to Azure in one week. <br><br>  <b>Quick access to data</b> .  The great advantage of AltaVault is how fast you can restore data with this device.  With ribbons such speed and completeness is impossible to achieve.  With AltaVault, full recovery can be done within an hour or two, and from any location. <br><br>  Notes <br><br>  See also additional information on <a href="http://www.netapp.com/AltaVault">AltaVault</a> and <a href="http://www.netapp.com/services">NetApp Professional and Support Services</a> . <br><br>  The solution is available at <a href="http://www.netapp.com/us/forms/altavault-fy15q4-m1.aspx">http://www.netapp.com/us/forms/altavault-fy15q4-m1.aspx</a> in a demo mode, without limiting the functionality for 90 days, after the trial period expires, all data will be available only for reading. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/303540/">https://habr.com/ru/post/303540/</a></p>
