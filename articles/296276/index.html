Previously, the only way to ensure that the post was viewed were likes, so you had to invest in landing pages, ads, which, as a result, now become less valuable over time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ee/dc7/7ae/4eedc77ae198443c9ac828a5a8023269.png">

      Users can now categorize fields and pages in their news feeds into <a href="http://blog.zogdigital.com/2015/04/21/facebook-updates-algorithms-news-feed-friends/">4 different priorities</a> : <a name="habracut"></a>  priority on display (whom to display first) on followers whose posts need to hide and explore new pages. <br><br>  At the moment, users have the opportunity to choose which post they want to see first when they start Facebook homepage on their iOS devices, and also, this opportunity will soon appear for other browsers. <br><br>  For brands, this is a new and powerful feature to gain an advantage when using this social network.  Following their previous update of the news feed, Facebook now provides a way for its users to bypass their complicated algorithm and just say ‚ÄúI want to really want to see more about it‚Äù, meaning wanting to use the news feed in the form in which it is most convenient and personalized. for each user.  This update for brands will mean the need to regulate their SMM marketing strategies to encourage users to add their pages to redesign their social content.  Brands need to encourage the user to perform an action, involving it with interesting content and filling it with a final CTA action, including social posting. <br><br>  It is noteworthy that to remind users about the possibilities to see more in Facebook posts, the blue star is above the priority publications in your feed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d3/92c/1f0/4d392c1f0af24c3f901717a3f5c21cfe.JPG"><br><br>  The new option allows users to select 30 accounts of news updates, emerging first in your news feed.  Excluded from the news feed posts will be grouped together, with two that remained visible and an option to see other posts on Facebook that correspond to the preferences of your account. <br><br>  Being in the top 30 on the Internet back in the days of Myspace, they choose an exclusive brand, invite only those who have seen the first messages to access, because users think: ‚ÄúI wonder what's going on in Facebook?‚Äù. <br><br>  New ability for 1.44 billion users of Facebook: the priorities are not only messages, but also whole accounts, users get brands and marketers, excited by the idea to build their social audience. <br><br>  And why not?  This is a chance for them to bypass the news selection algorithm in the tape in popularity, increase profitability by recording increases and activity.  It is quite acceptable to ask for likes and reposts on Facebook, which means that asking for sharing will be superfluous. <br><br>  People make new friends and find new pages for likes, but most likely they will not waste their time watching their news feeds. <br><br>  With the base of its users, the social network itself Facebook is growing extremely fast.  And, focusing on its users, this new feature for marketers comes into play directly as the value of reducing the role of likes.  Competition achievement and interaction on social platforms continues to intrigue the minds of marketers. <br><br>  When less time was spent on news feeds, the pages struggled for comments on Facebook.  Now, social media managers have a new way to build customer interaction and achieve likes and involvement in the life of the brand.  It did not go unnoticed, as other strategizing marketers begin new campaigns for the cherished blue star. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296276/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296276/</a></p>
