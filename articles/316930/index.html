Today we decided to look at how today's IT professions can change. <br><br>  There are very different predictions, but one thing is clear for sure - computer science is not going anywhere.  Director of the American Development Center Lisette Partelow writes at the end of her <a href="http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2016-06-29/progress-of-technology-only-makes-computer-science-education-more-valuable">article</a> that studying them is not tied to code per se, provides a more general and wide range of knowledge, therefore, no matter what scenario the world develops, such skills can be applied in many different professions in the future. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/316930/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/26f/ac4/ed7/26fac4ed7519494b861d87a54bde65c0.jpg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>/ photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/juditk/6355839949/">Judit Klein</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/">CC</a></i>

    <h2>  Affordable programming </h2><br>  The project <a href="https://code.org/">Code.org</a> , which is supported by many famous people (Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg) and companies (Amazon, Google and others), is aimed at popularizing programming among children and adults.  Editorial InfoWorld <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/3022874/application-development/9-predictions-for-the-future-of-programming.html">writes</a> that soon everyone will know how to program.  In addition to courses, it is possible that discipline will become an indispensable part of the elementary school program: already last year such a <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/coding-classroom-how-has-uk-curriculum-overhaul-fared-six-months-1489714">subject</a> was scheduled in the UK.  All this will significantly increase the IT literacy of the population. <br><br>  Today, both a child and an adult without special education can program a robot.  This <a href="http://observer.com/2015/07/the-future-of-toys-ones-kids-program-themselves/">opportunity</a> gives, for example, EZ Robot.  To do this, you first need to assemble it from plastic parts as a designer.  The instruction also contains information on how to train the robot.  But the author of the project says that the most ordinary people who are not engineers, were able to teach the robot completely different things.  For example, the instructions did not say how to train a robot to pour wine by the glass.  And it took the 13-year-old teenager only 4 hours to assemble the robot and program it with the help of the phone to distribute water to the developers office. <br><br>  Founder of the QuickBase platform and former PM at Microsoft Chris Granger (Chris Granger) considers his main goal to teach writers, biologists and accountants to use computers to solve their problems.  Today there are <a href="http://agilepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/Q2-2016-Forrester-Low-Code.pdf">many</a> such platforms and all of them are designed to help non-programmers.  Tyler Cowen, an American economist, writes in his book ‚ÄúAverage is Over‚Äù that, by obtaining these skills, people will be able to apply them in their fields of activity. <br><br>  For example, a doctor who uses computer programs to make a more accurate diagnosis or a sales manager who can filter customer data for more effective work will be more in tune with the realities of the future. <br><br>  But it is unlikely that any of these ‚Äúspecialists‚Äù will be able to become a full-fledged programmer, because it‚Äôs one thing to write a couple of lines of code or to master the program, and quite another to build a fully working system.  But such people can work in the technical field, for example, to become a software engineer, I'm sure Michael J. Coren (Michael J Coren), the author of <a href="http://qz.com/778380/the-future-is-software-engineers-who-cant-code/">this</a> article. <br><br><h2>  In the code only programmers </h2><br>  The number of programmers worldwide has already reached 15 million (see the ‚ÄúAll this could be yours‚Äù section in the BBC <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32743770">article</a> on the future of programming).  But their number is growing in different countries unequally: for example, India annually produces 100 thousand specialists in the field of computer science, and Britain - only 10 thousand.  Therefore, today even children's programming courses are actively developing.  In particular, a former employee of Google and Amazon, Vikas Gupta, founded the Wonder Workshop in Silicon Valley back in 2012, where children are taught to write code.  And on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">the</a> MIT <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">platform</a> with the Scratch language adapted for children, 6.2 million users are registered today.  Therefore, the number of specialists in the future will only grow. <br><br>  The need for the services of professional programmers in the future is unlikely to disappear: today there are more and more new languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat are being developed in corporations.  For example, Facebook created the language Hack, besides it there are Go (Google), Rust (Mozilla) and many others.  Of course, languages ‚Äã‚Äãare created not only by IT giants, but also by simple programmers.  New languages ‚Äã‚Äãare needed to fill gaps in the application of existing ones. <br><br>  The emergence of completely new languages ‚Äã‚Äãor the development of existing ones may be associated with the introduction of new technologies.  For example, the editors of Fast Company believe that the widespread introduction of <a href="https://1cloud.ru/news/cloudfiction3">cloud infrastructure has</a> influenced the modern world of languages ‚Äã‚Äã(for more details, see the New infrastructure section in the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3031443/why-does-the-world-need-more-programming-languages">source</a> ).  What exactly will affect languages ‚Äã‚Äãin the future is difficult to predict, but one thing is clear for sure - working with existing languages ‚Äã‚Äãand developing new ones will remain for technical specialists. <br><br><h2>  Special programming </h2><br>  Today it is possible to identify areas that in the near future will need IT specialists.  One of the directions of development of professions in such areas, which will only increase in the future - specialization.  For example, today such a direction as stock exchange analysis is developing.  A specialist of such a profile (the so-called quantum - from the English quant.) Is essentially a programmer in the financial field. <br><br>  Junior consultant and software engineer at Daugherty Business Solutions, Tyler Olsen (Tyler Olsen) calls speed one of the most important aspects of work, especially in HFT companies.  According to him, so far no other languages ‚Äã‚Äãcan compare with C and C ++.  But one of the leaders of Goldman Sachs Raj Mahajan (Raj Mahajan) <a href="http://news.efinancialcareers.com/us-en/245928/goldman-head-of-trade-execution-on-how-the-sector-will-change-by-2020">talks</a> about the possible directions of development in the field of financial services, including electronicization, a new generation of market makers and market changes that will be caused by quanta.  At least until 2020, quanta will be in trend, so some changes in this area may well occur. <br><br>  Another promising direction for programmers is consulting.  Cliff Justice (Cliff Justice), head of corporate services and consulting services outsourcing at KPMG, explains the <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2885892/future-proof-your-it-career-8-tech-areas-that-will-still-be-hot-in-2020.html">relevance of</a> analysts to the ever-increasing volume of data collected and the growing number of technologies being introduced.  Therefore, the company will recruit more and more database architects, data integration specialists and IT planners. <br><br>  The head of the practice of strategic IT planning in another consulting company, AT Kearney, Christian P. Hagen (Christian P. Hagen) calls for Hadoop developers, database engineers, big data software developers, and corporate databases among those in demand in the future.  In addition, he predicts the emergence of managing technical positions: the head of the analytics department, the head of the database department, the head of the digital technologies department, the head of the business intelligence department and the vice president of the corporate data department will be excellent career opportunities for technical specialists. <br><br>  In addition, information security specialists will be in demand in completely different areas: from the financial sector to the state and medicine.  According <a href="http://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/information-security-analysts.htm">to the</a> Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States, the number of vacancies in the field of information protection by 2024 will increase by 18% to 97,700 jobs. <br><br><h2>  Other trends </h2><br>  In addition, new professions will appear in other areas already developing today.  For example, the Internet of Things is gaining momentum.  By 2020, there <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/iot-ecosystem-internet-of-things-forecasts-and-business-opportunities-2016-2">will be</a> a network of 24 billion items (IoT), and investment in the industry in the next five years will amount to 6 trillion dollars.  But the approach to programming in this area differs significantly from the "traditional" programming.  Different approaches need to be applied to solve problems of working with limited memory and low processor speed, power consumption and radio communication. <br><br>  In 2015, 10,000 vacancies in the <a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx%3Fp%3D2472981">field of the</a> Internet of Things (‚ÄúInternet of Things‚Äù) were available only in the USA, and this figure will only grow.  The need for professionals from related fields will also grow: for example, General Electric <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahcaldicott/2014/11/30/ready-for-the-internet-of-things-5-skills-youll-need/">plans</a> to develop areas of work with big data, data analysis, embedded smart sensors, and remote control systems in order to achieve success in the field of the Internet of things. <br><br>  Another promising direction is artificial intelligence and robotics.  By 2020, cognitive analytics, intelligent automation, parallel processing of information will become more developed areas of AI and will lead to the beginning of the era of automation.  According <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3143718">to</a> Gartner, in 2018 about 3 million workers will work under the authority of the ‚Äúboss-robot‚Äù. <br><br>  Cliff Justice of KPMG, already mentioned by us, <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2885892/future-proof-your-it-career-8-tech-areas-that-will-still-be-hot-in-2020.html">notes</a> that IT specialists will be in great demand and will be directly involved in programming, integration and construction of infrastructure for organizational applications for AI and robotics.  But there is another <a href="https://www.quora.com/Will-there-be-a-high-demand-for-AI-specialists-skills-in-the-future/answer/Mike-Dannheim-1">opinion</a> : Mike Danheim (Mike Dannheim), co-founder of Sensei and 1Aperion, believes that the machines will become so smart that they themselves can develop the AI, without the help of scientists. <br><br>  <a href="https://1cloud.ru/news/myths-about-cloud-providers-part1">Cloud technologies will</a> also continue to evolve.  Experts call three main areas - the growth of hybrid cloud services, the introduction of BYOD policy and the emergence of a larger number of cloud brokers (CSB).  In the next five years, Gartner <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3384720">expects</a> strong growth in the cloud industry: about $ 1 trillion will be spent on the transition to cloud technologies, which will make them one of the largest expenditures in the IT sector since the beginning of the digital era. <br><br>  Therefore, experts expect the emergence of vacancies related to the management of cloud capacity.  Mike Sutcliff (Mike Sutcliff), director of the Accenture Digital group of companies, believes that due to the transition of companies to a hybrid environment, there will be an urgent need to quickly switch from private to public cloud for data processing and storage.  This will cause the demand for new technologies and specialties, which are still missing in most companies.  Sutcliffe also predicts the relevance of certain languages ‚Äã‚Äã(Perl, Ruby, Ruby on Rails and Python, Java and JavaScript) and specialists with API and DevOps skills. <br><br>  It is a little about our project ( <a href="https://1cloud.ru/">1cloud</a> ) on Habr√©: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/312120/">Customer focus as the basis of business: Experience IaaS-provider "1cloud"</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/312260/">A bit about security in the "cloud": Experience IaaS-provider "1cloud"</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/314022/">How to make virtual infrastructure more accessible</a> </li></ul><br>  We also collect such digests: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/316266/">VPN Digest: Introductory and practical materials on Habr√©</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/315758/">The ‚ÄúUltimate‚Äù SSL Digest: Best Practical Materials on Habr√© and Not Only</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/316930/">https://habr.com/ru/post/316930/</a></p>
