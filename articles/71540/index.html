  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The provider of e-Port is not responsible for payments not made by agents!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The other day I, as usual, tried to pay for the Internet through an <b>‚Äúinstant‚Äù payment</b> , it turned out to be the <b>e-Port</b> terminal. <br>  I received a check (although trouble may already happen at this stage).  Money did not come on the trail.  day on sunday nor monday morning. <br>  I called technical support, they <u>recognized the</u> payment (amount, transaction, id, etc.), but answered that the payment did not go through the fault of the agent.  At this, their qualifications and the actual support ended, ‚Äúcontact the agent‚Äù and that‚Äôs all ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Agent - 3 facts are known about him: name, TIN and telephone.  Moreover, the INN consisted of 13 digits (PI) and it is impossible to find it on the nalog.ru website, since  INN companies in the Russian Federation must be strictly from 10 digits (Or are there options?) <br><br>  This terminal is located in the ‚ÄúObuv-City‚Äù shopping center on Prospekt Vernadskogo metro station (of course there are other terminals, and other providers, probably). <br><br>  I called the agent, his representative said that they would understand. <br>  I wrote to e-Port in order to give NON-TECHNICAL advice and legal support, but received a reply - ‚ÄúYour question has been submitted to the specialists of the e-port Group.  In the near future, you will be provided with a qualified answer. ‚Äù <br>  They didn‚Äôt answer ... They wrote in 3-4 days that the agent would repeat the payment: ‚ÄúThe information on your payment was given to the dealer for the second payment.  Enrollment will be announced later. ‚Äù <br>  A representative of the agent said for several days that he was about to make a payment, called to come to the office and pick up the payment at the meeting, finally asked again to clarify the payment details by SMS, and - it was NOT PASSED and ten days - the payment was over.

      Such here, "instant" payments are, stretched and filled with a hassle ... Although it would seem - the <u>fact of non-payment is recognized, the details are</u> - what else do you need ??? <br><br>  Psychological aspects: <br><ol><li>  Rage.  The first reaction - return my money, and compensate for the loss (a few days without an Internet). </li><li>  Resistance.  It takes several days to convince opponents that they are wrong (but there is no way out for competent and responsible persons. There is no regulator and practice of complaints). </li><li>  Apathy.  After 7 days of chimes, correspondence no longer wanted to communicate with them, but no legal leverage was found (I paid the Internet again so as not to have inconveniences at home). </li></ol><br><br>  Questions: <br><ol><li>  What should be the responsibility of the provider?  Where to complain?  Why on their website does not indicate the percentage of failed (delayed, failed) payments?  What is the probability of default? </li><li>  What should be the responsibility of the agent?  Where to complain? </li><li>  What are some positive examples? </li><li>  What if the point of payment was not around work or at home - just call? </li><li>  Why do the owners of the terminal, worth about 100 thousand rubles, afford this?  They do not think that the device can be arrested, blocked, broken in the end? </li></ol><br><br>  In the end, I did not lose money, but the sediment remained.  It became clear that no one from the provider works with payers.  And there was a fear again to get on an unscrupulous agent. <br><br>  I want to wish good luck to everyone in this risky business - paying for instant payments through terminals, apparently, this is a game of roulette! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/71540/">https://habr.com/ru/post/71540/</a></p>
