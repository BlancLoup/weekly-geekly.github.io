Even so: CONSIDERED!  Our goals are fresh ideas, new energy, a variety of topics. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Joker or Batman?</b>

      Great inventors are like children.  They are not familiar with the saying "to break - not to build."  To come up with a reliable castle, they become bearish.  To do something interesting on this shore, they temporarily go to the opposite shore.  From there you can see better.  Examples?  You are welcome. <br>  Steve Jobs, being a 16-year-old boy, almost landed in the lot trying to sell phreaking devices.  Years later, he released the most popular smartphone on the planet, having practically grown the market of legal content for mobile devices from scratch.  Bill Gates is said to also be phreaking, and now his company owns Skype.  And God only knows that so many programs were manually broken until <a href="http://ilfak-gilfanov.moikrug.ru/">Ilfak Gilfanov</a> created the world's best disassembler IDA Pro. <br><br>  <b>Who are we looking for</b> <br><br>  We are looking for that ‚Äúyoung punk‚Äù, who will take a rag and convincingly wipe the popular idea that the ‚Äúbrains‚Äù have already been taken out of Russia, and the remaining population can only pump oil, cheat and shift papers.  The participant must have a student card or a scientific team.  Officially or unofficially - it does not matter to us.  Students of culinary technical schools developing a unique antivirus can also take part in the competition. <br><br>  <i>Andrei Petukhov, VMiK MSU: ‚ÄúThe centers for advanced information security research are currently formed and widely known in the international community: International Secure System Lab, Computer Security Group at UCSB, SysSec project, a group of researchers at the Ruhr University in Bochum.</i>  <i>And what about us?</i>  <i>Being agitated by vague doubts about the answer to this question, we decided to announce the PHDays Young School competition. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  <b>Glove thrown</b> <br><br>  Around the world, the university environment is, above all, an incubator of scientific thought, and not just a place where they "mow down" from the army, use the hostel and meet girls.  We are extremely interested in what research is conducted by Russian students and young scientists in the field of information security.  Or is the <a href="http://www.trud.ru/article/06-09-2011/267223_ni_odin_rossijskij_vuz_ne_popal_v_sotnju_luchshix_universitetov_mira.html">assessment of the situation</a> in the domestic "Harvard" and "Stanford" not too exaggerated?  Consider this question a challenge to the university community. <br>  We are not satisfied with the quality of training and the number of specialists in the field of information security.  It seems to us that the majority of them disappear somewhere (the same Gilfanov went to work in Belgium) or forever goes to the ‚Äúblack hackers‚Äù. <br><br>  Do you want to prove the opposite?  Welcome! <br><br>  <b>Motivation</b> <br><br>  We will invite the authors of the best works together with co-authors and supervisors to the Positive Hack Days forum on May 30-31, 2012 in Moscow.  The winners of the PHDays Young School competition will have a unique opportunity to present the results of their research in person to a wide expert audience, including leading Russian and international experts in the field of information security.  Perhaps on the forum you will find an investor for your project or an interesting job in the field of information security. <br>  For dessert - communication with the iconic figures of the information security market, participation in contests for hacking, first place among CTF viewers and, of course, a warm, sometimes fiery atmosphere. <br><br>  Attention!  The best research will be awarded a special prize! <br><br>  <b>Research Topics</b> <br><br>  Possible research topics may be as follows: <br>  new attacks, classes of vulnerabilities, ways to bypass the defense mechanisms; <br>  web application security; <br>  malware detection; anti-detection methods; <br>  anonymity on the Internet; <br>  security of mobile devices and applications; <br>  operating system security; <br>  network attack detection; anti-detection methods; <br>  counteraction to spam, phishing and other ‚Äúsocial‚Äù attacks. <br><br>  <b>Respected jury</b> <br><br>  The winners will be determined by leading experts, the ‚Äúfathers‚Äù of the information security industry and the leaders of research laboratories at leading universities.  The review will be cross-referenced and anonymous. <br>  <a href="http://andrepetukhov.wordpress.com/">Andrey Petukhov</a> , Moscow State University <br>  <a href="http://malotavr.blogspot.com/">Dmitry Kuznetsov</a> , Positive Technologies <br>  <a href="http://www.redsecure.ru/team/denis-gamayunov">Denis Gamayunov</a> , Moscow State University <br>  <a href="http://www.trust.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/people/alexandra-dmitrienko/%3Fno_cache%3D1">Alexandra Dmitrienko</a> , Technische Universitat Darmstadt <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ivlad/blog/">Vladimir Ivanov</a> , Yandex <br>  Alexey Kachalin, Advanced Monitoring <br>  <a href="http://www.xakep.ru/">Nikita Kitslitsin</a> , Hacker Magazine <br>  Igor Kotenko, SPIIRAN <br>  <a href="http://134.2.173.143/laskov/">Pavel Laskov</a> , Eberhard Karls Universitat Tubingen <br>  <a href="https://twitter.com/">Alexander Polyakov</a> , Digital Security, ERPScan <br>  <a href="https://twitter.com/">Alexey Sintsov</a> , Digital Security, Defcon Russia Group <br>  <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/abeshkov/">Beshkov Andrey</a> , Microsoft. <br>  Evgeny Rodionov, MEPI <br><br>  <b>Simple rules</b> <br><br>  Abstracts are accepted for the competition with the results of research conducted by students, graduate students and young scientists in the field of information security. <br><br>  <b>Requirements for the submitted works:</b> <br><br>  Presence of practical value: the substantiation of the novelty and / or relevance of the obtained results should be present in the submitted theses; <br>  in the work should be described and justified methods of scientific research. <br>  In addition, the conclusion of practical value should be based on the results of tests, during which should be shown: <br>  the applicability of the proposed method or tool; <br>  area of ‚Äã‚Äãits effective use. <br><br>  <b>How to make a thesis</b> <br><br>  Abstracts must be submitted in Russian and impersonal;  the text should not contain the names and e-mail addresses of the authors, as well as explicit references to the results of their work;  templates for abstracts are available <a href="http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html">here</a> ;  when making abstracts, it is recommended to focus on the ACM / IEEE US Letter standard, which will facilitate further work on the publication of materials.
