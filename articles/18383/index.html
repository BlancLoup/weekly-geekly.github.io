  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Freud TV</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once I was visited by a thought that probably visits everyone at a certain moment.  A thought is trivial and leads in a moment a chain of other thoughts.  At this point, you look pretty funny and even smile a little, and smile, of course, pretty idiotic) In short, one time, I realized that other people do not live at all like me, that is, they think, walk, eat, dress, they wake up, brush their teeth in a completely different way and many more, but the main thing is to think.  Perhaps many now say something like - ‚ÄúYes, I always knew it‚Äù and grin.  Well ... I'm happy for you =) So, since then this thought has not given me rest and does not give me to this day. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Not so long ago, at one of the ChGK tournaments from the question about Paris Hilton, I found out that she had no idea that she lived in the castle until she went to visit a girlfriend) Well, this is true, by the way.  It will be a little about something else.  If during the reading of the following set of letters you feel that this is not exactly what you expected, or not at all, or you suddenly stop understanding anything, you can just start reading from the end. <br><br>  As there are many catch phrases ending in "... and I will tell you who you are" or starting with "We are ...".  I'm talking about expressions like "Tell me who your friends are - and I will tell you who you are" or "Tell me what you eat - and I will tell you who you are" or "We are what we eat" or "We are things that surround us "or else a huge number of clear and not very expressions.  However, they all become clear under certain circumstances after a certain amount of time.  Or you can think long over the meaning and do not understand anything.  Or understand everything.  I, for one, completely agree that we are those things that surround us and suggest that you reflect a little on this.  I'm not going to prove it to someone, I do not need it.  I will just suggest that you close your eyes and imagine what would happen if all the things that are constantly around you would not exist.  Or that someone suddenly took your place in your life and began to live among your things. <br><br>  Of course, all this does not matter and in no way claims to philosophical reflections on life.  But once, I do not remember under what circumstances, but I suddenly realized a very simple thing.  But it struck me so much that I thought very hard.  And I realized that other people have different TV channels correspond to different buttons on the remote, or, if you wish, different numbers.  And immediately a lot of questions, the main of which - why?  All thoughts rush through my head at a breakneck pace, starting with ‚Äúwhy do I have channels located in this way and not in any other way?‚Äù And ending with ‚Äúwhat are people guided by when they assign numbers to channels?‚Äù.

      Here you can ask, why TV?  What is in it?  Why not take, for example, the color and texture of the wallpaper, because they, too, are all different and somehow they choose them.  Honestly, I don‚Äôt know, for some reason this thing seemed to me the most interesting.  And now it seems that the location of the channels can say something about a person.  I went along a simple path and just head on to my head, I assumed that the channel numbering process is unconscious or conscious at a very low level that is inaccessible to our understanding.  This, in my opinion, is used by channel managers, and they are doing everything possible to get us to put our channel as close as possible to button 1. Here are the names, symbols, slogans, and so on ... <br><br>  Again, I did not ask myself the question ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù, Although it is very interesting to me.  The purpose of this whole article was, in fact, rather modest - to find out from whom the TV channels were numbered and then build a certain rating.  All that is written above, just fleeting thoughts that accidentally fell on his fingers. <br><br>  So, the following channels take part in the competition (arranged in alphabetical order): NTV, ORT, Ren-TV, RTR, RTR-culture, RTR-sport, STS, TVC, TNT.  And to them another "main" regional channel, if any.  In my case (Kirov region) this is the ‚Äú33rd channel‚Äù.  Why I chose these channels, it is also better not to ask, I‚Äôll blame everything on Freud‚Äôs grandfather) I don‚Äôt have a TV at my main place of residence, and my father spent the assignment at home, so I‚Äôll quote his report: <br>  NTB..4, ORT..1, Ren-TV..6, RTR..2, RTR-culture..11, RTR-sport..13, STS.9, TVC..5, TNT..3 , Channel 33..8 <br><br>  I think most of those who read it will be interesting to wonder why, for example, ORT is on the first button.  And even more will not be interesting, well, clearly the ‚Äú1st channel‚Äù.  ‚ÄúSo what,‚Äù someone will say, ‚ÄúSTS calls itself the First Entertainment.‚Äù  And officially, the so-called first channel is still called ORT ... It will be very interesting to talk to a person who, at number 1, will have something other than the notorious channel.  Finally, all =) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18383/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18383/</a></p>
