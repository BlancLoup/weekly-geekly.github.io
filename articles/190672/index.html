    <h5>  1. Share with everyone </h5><br>  Use Open Source whenever you can, and as much as you can try to do your bit.  The joint wisdom of a huge community is better than the limited position of several large corporations. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  2. Play fair </h5><br>  Give other technologies, frameworks, methodologies and opinions a chance.  Do not consider your opinion the only correct one.  Other approaches to the problem may well be better than yours;  look at them with an open mind - it won't be worse. <br><br><h5>  3. Do not fight </h5><br>  Do not attack people just because they use .Net, Java or PHP.  Sometimes technologies can be much more useful and convenient than you think.  A person can teach more if you do not try to hammer their preferences into their heads at all costs. <br><br><h5>  4. Clean up after you </h5><br>  Try to write code that works.  Do not expect QA to find all the errors for you.  Test your code constantly, and deep into and in breadth. <br><br><h5>  5. Do not take what does not belong to you </h5><br>  Stick to the licenses for the code, libraries, or tools you use.  Do not steal, and then argue that he is innocent. <br><br><h5>  6. Apologize if you offended someone. </h5><br>  Code Review is a good, but rarely used idea.  Learning less experienced programmers benefits the team.  But it is not necessary to openly criticize if something is wrong, because to educate people does not mean to humiliate them.  Sometimes you will listen, sometimes not.  Sometimes you yourself will learn something from people whom you considered to be lower than your level. <br><br><h5>  7. Wash hands before eating </h5><br>  Try to understand the task before writing code.  Write a small prototype, look for counterparts in the network, chat with people who have done something similar.  To create something from scratch that hasn‚Äôt been dealt with before is not an easy task.  The result will be much better if you start working with an understanding of the problem. <br><br><h5>  8. Flush </h5><br>  Do not be afraid to replace, rewrite, restructure, or even delete a piece of bad code or a bad project.  Sometimes ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt know what to do ‚Äî throw it away and forget it‚Äù is the best thing to do.  Never fall excessively in your code. <br><br><h5>  9. Warm cookies and cold milk are good for you. </h5><br>  Yes, the programmer must have a comfortable and comfortable working environment.  A comfortable chair, a quiet workplace, a normal computer and tools that make development better and easier - all this is very important.  Managers should be umbrellas, protecting developers from all the bad that drips on top.  As a programmer, you should expect a decent relationship.  If the employer cannot provide this, it is worth thinking about finding a more adequate place of work. <br><br><h5>  10. Live life to the fullest - study and think, draw and paint, sing and dance, play and work </h5><br>  I like the work organization at Google, where you can devote 20% of your time to working on what you think it deserves (it's a <i>pity that this practice was canceled</i> ).  It would be nice to also provide rooms for recreation or games - programming is hard mental work, sometimes you just need to give your head a rest.  Avoid constant reprocessing - the fallen quality of work will negate the increase in productivity achieved at the cost of work at night. <br><br><h5>  11. Rest in the afternoon </h5><br>  Working 24 hours a day does not make it more productive.  Take breaks, go home, sleep a little.  Often, I was able to solve confusing problems just going home, and the solution occurred to me on the way home from work or the next morning. <br><br><h5>  12. Going out on the street, look around, hold hands and do not run away </h5><br>  Society is good for the soul - read blogs, learn new languages ‚Äã‚Äãand frameworks, participate in discussions and see what others are doing.  Just by doing your job, do not become a better programmer.  Having dug into working with your head, you risk one day to discover that everything has changed and your knowledge has become outdated. <br><br><h5>  13. Remember the miraculous.  It‚Äôs like a little seed in a pot of soil ‚Äî the roots grow down and the sprout goes up, and no one really knows how or why, but it‚Äôs so. </h5><br>  Every day something new and amazing happens in the world of programming and technology.  Learn about it.  Be surprised.  Learn something new every day.  It helps maintain fresh thinking and relevance of skills and broadens the mind. <br><br><h5>  14. Fish and hamsters and mice, and even a small seed in a pot - they all die.  And so do we. </h5><br>  The code gets old and dies.  Sometimes it's better to just put up with it and do it all over again.  There is no need to hold on to a terrible code just to save the money invested. <br><br><h5>  15. And now remember the books about Dick and Jane and the first word you learned - the most important word - LOOK. </h5><br>  <i>(Dick and Jane are heroes of books that were once popular in the USA for learning to read, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_and_Jane">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_and_Jane</a> )</i> <br>  You will not learn anything unless you try to do it.  Everything that I learned in programming was the result of not making a fuss with new interesting things.  Every morning I read a bunch of websites and find out what's happening in the industry;  I have been doing this since the very beginning of my professional career in the early 80s (then it meant reading directories and magazines) <br><br>  See, programming is easy, if you look through the eyes of a five year old child. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/190672/">https://habr.com/ru/post/190672/</a></p>
