  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make a successful career at IBM headquarters?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, habradrug! <br><br>  Many people periodically think about working in a large international company and I am not an exception.  That is why I was attracted to Inna Kuznetsova's book ‚ÄúUp‚Äù.  In her, she gives advice on building a career in a corporation.  Inna is the only Russian vice-president of IBM.  She is responsible for marketing and supporting system software sales, as well as managing the divisions responsible for IBM's Linux business and virtualization technology worldwide. <br>  Kuznetsova began work at IBM in Russia in 1993 after graduating from the VMK of Moscow State University.  In 1996 she moved with her husband to the United States and since 1997 has been working there in the ‚Äúblue giant‚Äù.  Since 2006, he has been holding executive positions.  She also received an MBA from Columbia University. <br><img src="http://img822.imageshack.us/img822/3646/vverh.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The tips in the book and the overall presentation are more like blog entries.  What is not surprising.  After all, Inna is a thousand in LJ.  The tips are based on her practical career building experience.  Everything is well structured.  At first it captures as an adventure story.  It is always interesting to read about the fate of successful people.  Then you start writing tips for use in practice.  Among them there is a well-known ‚Äúpraise employees publicly, to punish them strictly with one-on-one‚Äù, but presented unusually. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/637/0e3/2dc/6370e32dcf6618926ed13b927f5c5548.jpg" alt="image">

      An interesting chapter about the relationship with the head.  The establishment of contact with both good and bad is considered.  The general conclusion is that if you really want to build a career along the path you have planned, then you should get along with any boss.  Otherwise, someone else will.  As in war. <br><br>  But most of all my attention was hooked to the lines set out on just 7 pages that make up the smallest chapter of the book.  It is dedicated to mentoring.  This is what I think is very lacking in Russian companies.  In fact, senior officials must take someone to guide the true path (and this is not entirely voluntary).  Thus, simple managerial decisions can pass through the prism of a richer mentor experience.  What to say about career growth.  Of course, the mechanism of cultivating a new generation of effective managers (c) is also needed here.  I am talking about IT companies. <br><br>  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe book, I would highlight the following: plan your career for 10 years ahead (think who you want to become) and follow the plan to develop methodically.  Find a mentor who can help you make career decisions and share your experience with you. <br><br>  There are different types of books.  Some people are motivated to do business, they help to ‚Äújump into the unknown.‚Äù  Others are dedicated to self-development and leadership enhancement.  "Up" resembles their mixture.  Only instead of your own business, you build your own career.  And for those who want to move up, I recommend it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112281/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112281/</a></p>
