They attract more and more sponsors.  According to IAB and PwC, by 2020, revenue from advertising in podcasts in the US market alone will increase by 110% compared to 2017 - up to $ 659 million.

      Internet giants are once again interested in podcasts, and this is a positive signal for the market.  As we wrote <a href="https://habr.com/company/audiomania/blog/413069/">earlier</a> , Google plans to introduce a service with podcast recommendations.  Apple is definitely looking in the same direction: last year, a corporation from Cupertino <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/05/apple-buys-podcast-search-startup-pop-up-archive/">bought a</a> startup that created a technology for automatic speech recognition in podcasts. <br><br>  Developed in a niche and targeted audio advertising.  The number of services for targeted automatic placement of audio ads is increasing, and some of them work in accordance with <a href="https://www.acuityads.com/blog/2018/06/27/programmatic-ad-formats-mini-series-audio/">programmatic mechanics</a> .  Meanwhile, the Google DoubleClick platform <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/marketingplatform/360/digital-audio-ads-come-doubleclick/">began to</a> work with streaming services and broadcast brand ads in audio format, including podcasts on <a href="https://adexchanger.com/platforms/google-launches-programmatic-audio-ads-in-doubleclick-bid-manager/">the</a> Spotify and TuneIn <a href="https://adexchanger.com/platforms/google-launches-programmatic-audio-ads-in-doubleclick-bid-manager/">platforms</a> . <br><br>  Another tool for advertising targeting was created by Nielsen analytical company: Auto Cloud is a marketing platform for the automotive industry that provides contact with potential buyers.  Two podcast companies, Panoply and Westwood One, are already <a href="https://www.adweek.com/programmatic/audio-platforms-panoply-and-westwood-one-look-to-nielsen-for-data-backed-car-ads/">working</a> with this service. <br><br>  New opportunities for promotion through podcasts attract large companies.  Advertising is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/06/podcasts-brands-are-set-to-double-their-ad-spend---heres-why.html">bought</a> by car and clothing manufacturers, such as BMW and Chanel. <br><br><blockquote>  Some companies create their own shows. <br><br>  And if the original podcasts <a href="https://www.adweek.com/digital/major-brands-are-betting-big-podcasts-and-it-seems-be-paying-173035/">were</a> mainly <a href="https://www.adweek.com/digital/major-brands-are-betting-big-podcasts-and-it-seems-be-paying-173035/">produced by</a> technological and financial organizations, such as Netflix, eBay and State Farm Insurance, the company now has its programs at the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/gucci_podcast">Gucci</a> fashion house and the cosmetic brand <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/lipstories/id1370728732">Sephora</a> . </blockquote><br><h2>  Why brands place ads on podcasts </h2><br>  Podcast audience continues to grow.  According to 2018, 26% of Americans over 12 (73 million people) have listened to a podcast at least once in the past month.  83% of students in the 18+ age group have at least an incomplete higher education, and 54% work full-time.  This is a solvent audience that is interesting to brands. <br><br>  However, most people listen to the recordings to the end and do not rewind the advertisements in order not to miss anything in the program itself.  In addition, they usually have a high degree of loyalty to the show: according to the Midroll advertising network, the average Net Promoter Score for podcast listeners it works with <a href="http://awesome.midroll.com/">is at level 70</a> - even higher than that of Netflix. <br><br>  The most common advertising presenting model in our time is when the presenter reads the message from the brand himself: it is <a href="https://www.recode.net/2018/6/11/17448802/podcast-advertising-2017-iab-small">used</a> in 67% of the ads.  The audience, as a rule, calmly treats them, since they do not contrast much with the main content of the release.  Such close to native integrations, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2017/12/01/the-podcast-ad-playbook-baked-in-versus-dynamic-insertion-ads-explained/">according to Ad Results Media</a> , are on average three and a half times more efficient than those dynamically inserted from ad networks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hg/xa/um/hgxaumoechsdi2nl_icnfjq5p1i.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Photo by <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/greyscale-photography-of-condenser-microphone-765139/">Tommy Lopez</a> / PD</i></font> <br><br>  Another format that does not annoy the audience is branding of podcasts (both individual episodes and the whole show).  The public knows that the podcast is sponsored by the company, but continues to listen to it for content and appreciates brand unobtrusiveness. <br><br>  For example, Blue Apron delivery service for delivery of cooking sets <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40533210/branded-podcasts-are-the-ads-people-actually-want-to-listen-to">does the</a> transfer Why We Eat What We Eat.  She is led by Cathy Erway, the author of culinary books, who tells about the history of various dishes and trends in cooking.  Such a show is not perceived as an advertisement by Blue Apron, although it directly serves the purpose of its promotion. <br><br><h2>  Which way can the development of the industry </h2><br>  Representatives of advertising services in podcasts and leading such programs in 2015 <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2015/05/01/tech/inside-weird-world-podcast-advertising">showed a desire to</a> cooperate with major brands.  Three years later, their aspirations <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/06/podcasts-brands-are-set-to-double-their-ad-spend---heres-why.html">begin to</a> come true.  True, the flagships of the market (FMCG giants, automakers, etc.) are only being mastered at selected online audio shows, for example The Daily from The New York Times. <br><br>  However, advertising from large companies do not always like users.  The insurer GEICO, one of the <a href="https://radiofacts.com/geico-dropping-major-dollars-on-radio-ads/">largest</a> advertisers of American radio stations, ran into such a public reaction.  He launched an ad in the Dan Le Batard Show podcast, which <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DanLeBatardShow/comments/829bjf/lets_put_it_on_the_poll_podcast_listeners_only_do/">infuriated</a> his fans: now they say they <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DanLeBatardShow/comments/9v0pxn/i_never_skip_the_podcast_ads_but/">will not</a> specifically use the services of the company because of its ‚Äúterrible‚Äù promotion. <br><br>  According <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/25/whats-next-for-podcasting-subscriptions-and-exclusives/">to</a> media investor Eric Peckham (Eric Peckham), cooperation with corporations limits the creative freedom of the creators of audio content.  At least, because they have to adjust the content of the programs and their style to the wishes of advertisers. <br><br>  Another problem with advertising in podcasts is the automatic placement of ads.  From the point of view of the columnist of the Folio edition of Steve Smith (Steve Smith), the ways of promoting brands in podcasts <a href="https://www.foliomag.com/please-fix-podcasting-jumps-shark/">are getting</a> worse.  Pre-recorded third-party announcements interspersed in the program sound much less sincere than when the presenter speaks about the brand.  Also the content of advertising often falls out of the context of the show. <br><br><blockquote>  New advertising tools <a href="https://digiday.com/media/podcast-ads-remain-stubbornly-old-fashioned/">do not like</a> many authors.  The creators of the HowStuffWorks podcast at the end of 2017 decided to completely abandon the automatically placed ads, because the audience did not like them: they felt ‚Äúas if they were shouting at them‚Äù. </blockquote><br>  According to Packham, podcasts will move to a different monetization model.  A possible way for independent authors is to introduce a paid subscription to their shows;  such functionality in the next two to three years may appear on several podcast terminals.  However, a single ‚ÄúNetflix for podcasts‚Äù has <a href="https://habr.com/company/audiomania/blog/419229/">not</a> yet been <a href="https://habr.com/company/audiomania/blog/419229/">created</a> , so it is not yet clear which way the audio content industry will follow. <br><br><hr><br>  <i>More about sound and music in our Telegram channel:</i> <i><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/646">Traditions of the Soviet dubbing</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i>Go</i> <i><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/645">Behind the frame of simultaneous translation</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/644">We continue to talk about the translation of films</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/643">The same voice from the 90s</a></i> <br><br><hr><br>  <i>From <b>November 22 to November 25,</b> <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/hot_price/">Black Friday is held</a> in ‚ÄúAudiomania‚Äù.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The action involves several hundred items with discounts up to 70%.</i>  <i>At the sale presents a variety of audio equipment: from headphones and portable gadgets to Hi-Fi-audio systems.</i>  <i>This is a great opportunity to buy a gift for loved ones for the New Year holidays or to take with a good discount what you have been looking for for a long time.</i> <br><br><hr></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/430894/">https://habr.com/ru/post/430894/</a></p>
