  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Choosing a phono stage - to each his own</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the environment of vinylophiles, it is regularly added, and more and more newly made adepts of the ‚Äúlive‚Äù mechanically extracted sound appear.  However, it should be noted that by no means all of the devices that are resurrected from the non-existence of the apparatus understand how to get really high-quality and really necessary sound.  Runet is flooded with numerous player reviews, where competent authors help vinyl-insane neophytes to purchase a suitable turntable.  Amplification and acoustics, as a rule, already have, reviews devoted to them, too, is enough.  But the choice of the phono stage is already causing more difficulties for novice fans of hi-fi and hi-end.  As a rule, preamplification information for vinyl is either an article about why a phono preamp is needed, or frankly advertising uninformative posts describing specific models that you definitely need to purchase in ‚Äúthis‚Äù salon, the et set era online store. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f3b/acd/c5a/f3bacdc5a3154830bf2d4502551256ad.jpg"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Built-in phono equalizer is good news for owners of ‚Äúantique‚Äù amplification </h3><br>  The vast majority of old (25-30 years old) and some new amplifiers have a built-in phono preamp.  It is enough to connect the player to the input labeled "Phono" and you already have a fully-fledged sound picture.  An important caveat - in such systems, it is necessary to take into account the compatibility of the corrector with the type of player head.  Accordingly, the MM-head will not sound adequately with the MC-phono stage. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a18/7bd/4fd/a187bd4fda0a4e078efab03d015c4145.jpg"></div><br>  Another option is the phono stage built into the player.  In such cases, as a rule, the spinner will cost more.  There will be no nuances with the type of head, if the basic equipment is used (in any case, the technical documentation for such a player should be marked accordingly).  The advantage of such preamplification is maximum integration with the turntable scheme, although in budget turntables the stated is not the rule (especially for devices created in the Celestial Empire). <br>  In addition to the advantages, the built-in phono correction has tangible drawbacks.

It is known that the most accurate equalization can be ensured precisely at the stage of preamplification.  In the case of built-in options, the user of the device is limited by the capabilities of the amplifier.  Another fact is not in favor of the built-in phono correction (more often it concerns cases of integration with the amplifier) ‚Äã‚Äã- this is the inevitable increase in the non-linear distortion coefficient.  (more often concerns cases of integration with the amplifier) ‚Äã‚ÄãThe general scheme, with a large number of details, will naturally negatively affect the sound.  (SOI built-in preamplifier often, more than an independent device).  Of course, the above is not mandatory, but more likely, given the design features of such systems. <br><br>  Most pretentious audiophiles prefer independent phonocorrection. <br><br><h3>  Warm lights are fun, not for everyone </h3><br>  One of the ideal preamplifiers for vinyl, many recognize tube phono stages.  Of course, the use of lamp systems, deliberately deprived of semiconductors creates a unique sound picture filled with even harmonics.  The lamp circuit will give the sound expressiveness and brightness.  Equally wide and deep stage coupled with a clear warm sound, expressive low and rich slightly overestimated averages not many people are indifferent.  But alas, this solution is not suitable for everyone.  In order to fully experience the advantages and features of this type of preamplification, an appropriate (tube!) Amplifier is needed. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/991/813/b3b/991813b3ba6647dd9e26d44b72c713e1.JPG"></div><br>  Like any other technology, lamp phono stages have disadvantages.  Compared to digital or combo systems, the equalization accuracy of an analog device will probably be lower. <br><br>  The functionality of lamp systems is also generally inferior.  To reduce the level of distortion and to obtain a ‚Äúpure analog‚Äù sound, the design of tube phono stages is intentionally simplified.  Probably the most serious disadvantage of tube devices for preamping is their cost, sometimes they can be an order of magnitude more expensive than other types, especially for top-end models of famous brands.  For other purposes, consider the life of the lamps and the need for their periodic replacement after a few years.  The amount is very impressive.  The cost of the device itself rarely significantly exceeds 60,000 rubles. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b3c/edd/d59/b3ceddd5905b45fab7523157af56db27.jpg"></div><br><h3>  Cheap Lamp Myth </h3><br>  Today, there are many budget lamp technology - this is the so-called samopaly or custom-device, among others, and phono.  I want to note, to choose a really high-quality handicraft device is difficult, for this, experience is needed.  Manufacturers, they are sellers of such devices are subtle psychologists, as a result, an inexperienced novice audiophile can pay a fairly large amount for a device that is not worth it, and it is not clear when it will fail.  If you intend to acquire "samopal", try to conduct a preliminary test, taking an experienced and competent person. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/02f/9bc/c62/02f9bcc626bc4c9e89b810cd6227f8f6.jpg"></div><br>  I will not hide, there are really reliable custom workshops and craftsmen who create unique and high-quality devices, but there are few of them and their products are not much cheaper, and in some cases more expensive, factory-made.  Practically everything that I have heard from the handicraftsmen somehow does not reach the average figure, the scene does not shine, or the average is understated, or there is some incomprehensible background, or a crash when you twist the resistor handle.  Friends had cases when (I emphasize, with proper operation and switching), a cheap amplifier and tweeters burned out in equally expensive acoustics.  Craftsman did not bear responsibility for his creation and said that the device was ‚Äúimproperly exploited,‚Äù which seemed to hint at ‚Äúhigh responsibility‚Äù and ‚Äúfirm warranty obligations.‚Äù Therefore, be careful. <br><br><h3>  Digital phono stages </h3><br>  One of the most common types of device for preamping a turntable.  You can not talk about the uniqueness of the sound of digital phono stages, but their main advantage is a predictable result, at the expected level.  The figure is more stable than analog charms.  Expensive digital devices sound very decent.  Many who can afford the lamp do not rarely choose the top series of digital and hybrid devices.  This is especially true for oldfagi to a clean, cold sound, happy owners of old transistor amplifiers with a dualmono-circuit. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/669/ded/06c/669ded06c4f94dabb07ab5b9da6efac0.png"></div><br>  High functionality, often good clarity, sufficient depth of the low, excellent dynamics and a wide scene are the main advantages of digital phono stages.  There are very successful systems capable of competing with the lamp in the depth of the stage and the saturation of the sound, but such devices rarely cost less than 15 - 20 000 rubles, and usually more. <br><br>  The main disadvantages are: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ It is not uncommon to ‚Äúsand‚Äù when trying to seriously increase the high ones; <br>  ‚Ä¢ In budget models, the sound is flat and trivial, not enough volume; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Almost everyone overstates the average; <br><br><h3>  Hybrids - and eat the figure and play on the lamp </h3><br>  Some manufacturers of phono preamps have gone the way that guitar equipment manufacturers have passed to them.  They attempted to combine tube amplification with functionality and precision tuning of digital systems.  Actually, get a warm tube sound with sniper accurate equalization and processing. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3e7/509/2cc/3e75092ccb184106b77980336c472aee.jpg"></div><br>  Phono-correctors created using such a scheme can have both all the advantages and all the disadvantages of the systems described above.  "True" followers of tube sound consider using hybrids to be the killing of "correct" sound.  I have heard several samples from the 60K + price category, and I can note nothing dead in this sound, I did not find - very decent devices.  The prices for these phono-correctors, as you probably guessed, range from simply high to exorbitant (over 100K). <br><br><h3>  Criterias of choice </h3><br>  For many, the criterion is price, which is not surprising - the prices will be discussed further in the text.  The second important factor is the attitude to music and the pretentiousness of the ears.  If you are disturbed even by minor distortions, you have listened to your classics live all your life or are used to studio conditions, get ready to pay a lump sum and not just for the phono-corrector.  Once again I remind you about the type of head - be sure to pay attention to what type of pickup head you have. Next, you will be faced with the question of choosing a circuit.  If you have lamp amplification and you feel a significant difference - your way is a lamp or a hybrid.  If you need a relatively budget option and you will not feel sick from the "dead" sound - choose a number for yourself. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/43a/973/847/43a973847b2a4607b87543dfb681069d.jpg"></div><br>  Perhaps you will be satisfied with the built-in phono stage, if you have not yet purchased an amplifier and player, pay attention to the combined devices.  Regarding the choice of handicraft devices, it is difficult to advise something essential, most of them are unpredictable and each is unique in its own way, but sometimes uniqueness is not for the better. Subjective assessment is the most important criterion.  The perception of sound is a strictly individual process, we all hear in different ways.  It is necessary to go to the showroom or evaluate a similar device by listening to your friends.  Ideally, if the test audition will be conducted with the same player, the main amplification and acoustics. <br><br>  For me, the perfect phono stage opens up a wide surround sound stage, has a rich, expressive sound, allows you to accurately set the equalizer settings (equipped with four equalization bands), gives a clearly distinguishable and dynamic sound, deep low and balanced high and medium.  And yet, I like a warm enough sound.  What you like, you will understand - the main thing is to listen. <br><br><h3>  Prices </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b4/cbb/199/0b4cbb199a504a739c7006074f100d84.jpg"></div><br>  Let's face it, in a similar technique, often, the quality, detail, depth, stage and balance of sound are directly proportional to the price.  Accordingly, it makes sense to choose from devices in the price range of 7,000 rubles.  Certainly there are some modest, but having the right to the existence of devices for 3500 - 5000, but for the picky and demanding ear they will not be enough.  The sound of almost all budget phono stages is quite trivial, as a rule, there is a lack of detail and depth of the sound stage.  It should be noted that a cheap phono stage may well have a wide stage, deep bottoms and more than tolerable dynamics. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398245/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398245/</a></p>
