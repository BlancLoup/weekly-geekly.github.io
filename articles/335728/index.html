But there is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DpDMkV4DfpuI">pathetic video series</a> , for which <br>  true, not worth a single real construction project. </li><li>  The code on the Gita is not good either: there are <a href="https://github.com/sosnovkinoico/code">smart contracts</a> , but two of them are obviously standard </li><li>  An interesting fact is that there is an analogue of the site: <a href="http://sosnovkino.trade/">http://sosnovkino.trade</a> .  The question is just why?  In the case of a block - mobile change? </li><li>  The site also has a <a href="http://sosnovkino.trade/newenergy.pdf">guarantee</a> from the company "New Energy".  The company request has been sent via the <a href="http://nskenergo.ru/kontakty">contact form</a> , I hope that they will be quick.  By the way, a query by name and company (Baturin + New + Energy) also does not give anything meaningful.  The only thing is an <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search%3Fq%3Dcache:ZHH_4IGq9DIJ:nskenergo.ru/nasha-komanda%2B%26cd%3D1%26hl%3Dru%26ct%3Dclnk%26gl%3Dru">archive copy of Google</a> : there is such a person in it.  Judging <a href="">by the site map, the page was updated on</a> 06.02.17: after that - the given full name was hidden for some reason.  Perhaps leaked in the wrong direction?  In addition, there is no printing on the document.  You can look at the Charter (and you should), but for now I strongly doubt that this LLC has exercised the right to work without printing in such an industry. </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c43/aeb/669/c43aeb669afb4805aaab5605e2123a0d.png"><br><br>  Location: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/6ca/568/41b/6ca56841b9fb4a76b2b1a58e01e0f99c.png"><br><br>  There is a village in the Novosibirsk region with the clear name of Sosnovka, but, firstly, in the inset from the map, it does not look like a project;  secondly, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe village - 163 hectares;  and most importantly, more than 1,000 people already live there.  There is also a project (organized in 2012) Sosnovka Village, but even its website is not available - <a href="http://sosnovka-village.ru/">http://sosnovka-village.ru/</a> .  Nothing sensible, except blurry reviews did not find.  But in any case, about any Sosnovkino out of the question.  <a href="https://yadi.sk/i/AMPwaJMf3LPQZB">In the White Paper,</a> you can find the "exact" coordinates on the inventory - 54: 07: 047401: 1444 (number), which also do not fight anywhere. <br><br>  Meanwhile, Sosnovka and Sosnovkino are, according to a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SosnovkinoICO/">group‚Äôs</a> reassurance <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SosnovkinoICO/">on Facebook</a> , alongside: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e23/329/b93/e23329b93c8f4d88854ed4d1064bd4a2.png"><br><br>  According to reviews of users, it was possible to establish that the ‚Äúcompany‚Äù uses SPAM mailings and is not even ready to comment on this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fa5/f54/4c9/fa5f544c9593429c88e403548c2aa663.png"><br><br>  The guys from ICOrating, by the way, <a href="http://icorating.com/project/173/Sosnovkino">agree with me</a> : the project was classified as highly risky. <br><br>  But let's talk about the creators (profiles can be found on the site).  In particular, ‚ÄúExecutive Director Maxim <b>Dvenidov</b> has been <b>involved</b> in real estate for over 10 years.  He has a positive experience in the foreign real estate trade.  At the moment there are more than 3,000 realized land plots in Russia, several successful development projects in the Czech Republic and a project for holiday apartments in Thailand. ‚Äù <br><br>  A good track record: only he is already on the site of the CEO and his name is Maxim, but of the <b>Dudenids</b> .  And the information on it, as well as on Olga Serbienko, is searched quickly: but there‚Äôs nothing but Sosnovkino there.  Meanwhile, for example, Olga studied in Switzerland.  Yes, and Maxim raised 3,000 projects: this is not a needle in a haystack.  Or were they all closed? <br><br>  I myself, not by hearsay, know how difficult it is to receive thanks from clients who have gone through the NDA with you.  But not 3,000 times in a row? <br><br>  Here's another <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DfgFKnyels8g">video</a> on an unknown channel with 9 subscribers.  With 6000 views and two likes and dislikes (one is mine).  And most importantly - with the story, where again there is no video from the scene.  Why?  The only thing I found is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DZ7WWJ-0xOCA">these frames</a> , where there is no story about how to get to the place, what landmarks there are, coordinates finally.  But the main thing: where are all the documents on such a huge amount of land, and even a reservoir?  I, as a lawyer, are very interested.  Why should I look for it and not see right away?  And yes, compare the previous video with the one that is higher <a href="https://youtu.be/ahEE2octg8M%3Ft%3D23s">here in this moment</a> : are the mountains immediately apparent?  Then the question is, where are they on the video?  If this is just a common video so poorly drawn, then, perhaps, it is necessary to make a good one?  I think it's about time. <br><br>  And <a href="https://youtu.be/LyOIeIY3JGc%3Ft%3D1m16s">here it is</a> quite interesting: it turns out that the fund in the Caymans owns 194 hectares of land in Russia, and even at the reservoir?  And in the same frames we are talking about the growth of investment not by 300, but by as much as 600%.  And another thing: the video is in Russian, and the main Central Asian, judging by the White Paper, are foreigners.  There is a reasonable question: "how is that?".  Dissonance. <br><br>  In the same video, I am still confused by the incomprehensible education on the speaker‚Äôs face and the quality of the video itself: even I can do this, but not a project that claims major development deals TO ICO. <br><br>  The same applies to documents: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-QBdFrWXGeAVF9nN1RXclBWaGM/view">in Russian there is a</a> usual pdf with a description of suburban real estate of Novosibirsk, which has nothing to do with the project.  And here is an <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-QBdFrWXGeAMXRGS2JWTm4tYkE/view">analysis of the real estate market in Russia</a> .  It would be wonderful if there was a similar analysis of Sosnovkino.  But some information in a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-QBdFrWXGeAT25FeVlMSmdOYzA/view">table</a> format.  But why in English?  That is, the general description is in Russian, and the subject description is in English?  It does not happen: it should not be. <br><br>  <b>What is the bottom line?</b> <br><br><ol><li>  The team is looked for, but does not fight: a lot of merit is claimed, but in fact it is impossible to find something; </li><li>  No serious project documentation; </li><li>  Video - a general plan; </li><li>  No coordinates, no shooting, not even photos from the scene; </li><li>  On trifles (documents, signatures, etc.) - there is also no coincidence; </li><li>  Legal entities - either do not exist or bravely hide; </li><li>  Salt of the project - to make quickly, to get a lot, and even not to forget about passive income; </li><li>  And all this - against the background of the real estate market, which is more dead than alive. </li></ol><br>  I do not know about you, dear residents of Habr, but I do not like this approach.  I already told in the last article that now communities are forming among chats ( <a href="https://t.me/bitfund">such</a> and <a href="https://t.me/ICO_law">such</a> ) and among platforms like <a href="https://www.kickico.com/ru/">kickico</a> (the last one I met). <br><br>  But it seems to me that the largest IT community should not remain aloof from such problems and help develop the theme of the struggle not only with ‚Äúpure‚Äù fraud, but also cases where vagueness and pathos create situations that are even stranger and worse, as in aspect of technology development and social interconnections. <br><br>  <b>Read, comment: let the power of the pen win the dark side!</b> <br><br>  UPD.  About them - on another <a href="https://vc.ru/p/identify-scam">resource</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/335728/">https://habr.com/ru/post/335728/</a></p>
