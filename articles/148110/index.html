This model was developed by Professor Noriaki Kano in the 1980s;  it can be used to analyze customer satisfaction (customer experience, CX) from using products or services.  The results help to make better investments in product development and, therefore, increase customer satisfaction. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  According to the Kano model, the properties of a product or service that affect <strong>customer satisfaction</strong> can be divided into three groups: basic (expected), basic (desired), and admiring (influencing).

    <img title="kano-model" src="http://zamesin.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/kano-model-full-res.png" width="600" height="489"><br><br>  In the coordinate system of this model, customer satisfaction is measured along the Y axis, and the level of fulfillment is measured along the X axis (how effective is the property implemented in the product or service). <br><br>  Let's talk about each group of properties and give a few examples. <br><br><h2>  Basic (expected) properties </h2><br>  Baseline (expected) properties are the fundamental properties of a product (or service) that are inherent to it by default.  The presence of such properties consumers take for granted and, accordingly, rarely think about them in principle. <br><br>  Here are some examples of basic (expected) properties: <br><ul><li>  The basic property of the service, such as, for example, airfare, can be a guarantee that the flight will not be canceled or that everyone who bought tickets has enough seats in the cabin. </li><li>  The basic feature of a web application, such as Gmail, can be constant availability (the almost complete absence of failures) or instant message sending when you click the "Send" button. </li><li>  The basic property of an application, such as iTunes, can be an unlimited playback of a purchased song. </li></ul><br>  The level of implementation of the basic properties of the product does not affect customer satisfaction directly.  The very presence of such properties in a product or service does not cause them special emotions, because, according to consumers, these properties must be present by default.  But if you omit any basic property, then no other properties of the product (main or admiring) will save the consumer from frustration.  Thus, it is rather difficult to turn a basic property into a competitive advantage, but its absence can easily cause very serious damage. <br><br><h2>  Basic (desired) properties </h2><br>  The main (desired) properties - these are the properties of the product, the level of implementation of which directly affects customer satisfaction.  Therefore, it is on the basis of these properties that companies are trying to create competitive advantages, trying to distinguish their product among others and investing more or less money in its specific basic properties compared to competitors. <br><br>  We give examples of such properties: <br><ul><li>  Air travel: the distance between the seats (in the first and business class it is more than in economy class) and the number of transfers along the way. </li><li>  Gmail: free storage space. </li><li>  iTunes: the number of codecs and file formats available for import. </li></ul><br><br>  The principle is this: more space between the seats so that passengers can stretch their legs - higher satisfaction from the service as a whole.  Due to the consistent nature of changes in such properties, as well as the fact that the level of their implementation usually significantly affects the cost of a product or service, it is the basic properties of a product that become the main tool in the competitive struggle (although victory is not so easy given here). <br><br><h2>  Admiring properties </h2><br><br>  Delightful (acting) properties are always something unexpected for the consumer, for example, additional or some extraordinary properties of a product or service. <br><br>  Here are examples of properties that can excite the consumer: <br><ul><li>  Air travel: really tasty, and not just edible food on board. </li><li>  Gmail: Priority folder with an intelligent function to mark and sort unread messages. </li><li>  iTunes: wirelessly sync apps and music files. </li></ul><br><br>  As in the case of basic properties, the level of implementation of admirable properties does not directly affect customer satisfaction.  If the admiring property is absent, consumers will not be disappointed at all, as they didn‚Äôt have any expectations about this property.  But if the admiring property is found by consumers, then thanks to the effect of surprise, they will be so impressed that they simply cannot resist and not share their discovery with others. <br><br><h2>  Consumer expectations: higher and higher and higher </h2><br><br><img title="kano-model-with-time" src="http://zamesin.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/kano-model-with-time1.png" width="600" height="489"><br><br>  One of the most important aspects that the Kano model allows us to consider is the change in the properties of products over time.  As consumers become accustomed to a given property, and companies offer all the best and best of its options, consumer satisfaction associated with this property will gradually decrease. <br><br>  When Gmail just appeared, these 1 GB free mailboxes produced a bombshell among consumers.  Here we have definitely dealt with the admiring property.  Now almost any mailbox has the same capacity, so that ordinary users now have to think about this is not necessary.  As we can see, the availability of 1 GB storage has moved from the category of admiring properties to the category of basic properties.  Moreover, in a short time it will certainly become a basic property. <br><br>  Thus, a fascinating property that delights consumers today, as more and more companies embed it (and possibly its improved versions) in their products and services, will gradually become the main feature.  In the end, the moment will come when the consumer will respond only to the absence of this property, further improvements will become inappropriate, and the property will become basic. <br><br>  Council  Check out this very <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D8r1CZTLk-Gk">interesting interview with Louis CK</a> , where he talks about the ever-growing expectations of consumers. <br><br><h2>  Useful conclusions from the Kano model </h2><br><br>  How can a Kano model help with current or upcoming web projects?  In addition to customer satisfaction with the use of products or services, this model can also analyze the effectiveness of investments aimed at increasing satisfaction.  And what conclusions from the Kano model will help us in this. <br><br>  First of all, you need to make sure that the basic properties are flawless: if you do not lay a solid foundation, everything will fall apart, like a house of cards. <br><br>  Do not try to keep up with all the market trends at once.  When investing in the basic properties of the product, you need to focus on the target audience: this way you will be able to understand exactly which properties need to be introduced or improved. <br><br>  The appearance of unexpected admirable properties is what makes people start talking about the product.  Having ensured the realization of all the necessary basic and several basic properties, it is necessary to think carefully about what admirable properties you can offer to consumers and due to this stand out among the competitors. <br><br>  Today's admirable property may be transformed tomorrow into the category of basic properties, and after some half a year it may even become basic.  Consumer expectations are growing steadily, and in order to keep up with them, you need to constantly work to improve products and services. <br><br>  To create admirable properties, a deep understanding of the true needs of consumers, their behavior and environmental conditions is necessary.  And do not try to copy what competitors are doing: by the time you succeed, the admirable property will no longer be such. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/148110/">https://habr.com/ru/post/148110/</a></p>
