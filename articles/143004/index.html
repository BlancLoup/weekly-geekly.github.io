Until now, word of mouth remains the best way to find a doctor: we seek recommendations from familiar doctors or a person who has already encountered a similar problem, but if there are no such friends?  It remains to search the Internet. <br><br>  But even here it is not so simple, many sites of clinics, but there are no guarantees that you will receive an appointment with a really good doctor.  And it‚Äôs okay if a bad dentist puts in a filling that falls out in two months - this is half the trouble.  What about the risk of running into a dropout dermatologist?  Or an unscrupulous surgeon?

      My search for a doctor on the Internet turned out that the found "specialist" my pneumonia was mistaken for bronchial asthma.  Two weeks of improper treatment led to severe complications and urgent hospitalization.  I won‚Äôt go too far with the topic - I think many will agree with me that relying on a severe medical issue is extremely risky on the Internet <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  What's up, Doc? </h4><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/077/f38/711/077f387117c9b5f5eefc7c4397bfbff3.jpg" alt="image">  After this story, I had a question with the search for a doctor: and if in my hometown through acquaintances it was possible to solve this problem in a couple of days, then in Moscow the story translates into a whole epic.  Then for the first time the thought occurred to me to create a service to find a suitable doctor. <br><br>  As it usually happens with startups - at first the idea was long nursed in my head.  I was interested in the creation of a service for the selection of a doctor, and not a simple database of doctor profiles and clinics.  There was nothing of the kind on the Internet, and after conducting a small survey among my friends, I found out that 9 out of 10 would definitely use such a service. <br><br>  In general, the task is simple, but it was necessary to understand what kind of information a person needs for selection and by what criteria doctors will be evaluated - for those who do not understand the specifics of education and the title of doctors, we decided to make an integral rating from a set of professional indicators.  Sorted, and immediately saw who is the coolest specialist. <br><br><h4>  Freebie sir </h4><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/322/d38/62d/322d3862ded1a31da52b8e76b1fc1f7f.jpg" alt="image">  Working in several web studios provided me with many useful acquaintances, so the designer and programmer were found fairly quickly.  A couple of brainstorming in a cafe with Wi-Fi and the project was solemnly laid out on a large sheet of paper. <br><br>  The main thing that came to - the service should be completely free for the user.  To do this, we planned all monetization by doctors and clinics. <br><br>  Another important point was the possibility of a ‚Äúhouse call‚Äù: the doctor‚Äôs card indicates whether he leaves for calls, which district he serves and if he accepts patients at home. <br><br><h4>  Would you make an appointment with House? </h4><br>  Professionalism is not the only thing a patient needs.  A doctor works with people; therefore, his purely human qualities are important: attentiveness, tact, and even kindness.  And this can only be learned from those who have already been at his reception. <br><br>  Therefore, the function of reviews on the site is critically important: be it a specialist three times, have 2 diplomas and 3,000 publications, if you want to forget a visit to him, like a bad dream, this should be reflected adequately in the rating. <br><br>  To be sure of the reliability of the reviews, we decided to publish on the website only reviews of those patients who signed up for a doctor through our portal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/344/ee7/b9e/344ee7b9e81b1432bbbb706c4bc4b5fd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The very scheme of work with the user excludes the possibility of publishing fake reviews.  Thanks to CRM, we know for sure who, when and to which doctor made an appointment. <br><br><h4>  Why does it work </h4><br>  Free and convenient - this, in general, could be stopped, but there are also: <br><br><ol><li>  <b>Objectivity in the assessment of specialists</b> : qualifications and experience are carefully checked.  Questionnaires are sorted by several parameters: by rating, by cost, by experience.  You can also tick and see only the doctors in your area and / or those who leave the house. </li><li>  <b>Ability to use the help of a portal consultant by phone</b> .  We help to find the right doctor for free.  Consultants will talk in detail about the doctor using additional data stored in the database.  In addition, our call center is advised by general practitioners who will help you choose the right doctor. </li><li>  <b>Additional feature is diagnostics</b> : a reference book of diagnostic centers that carry out certain examinations.  For example, you need to check your thyroid gland: you select a center near your house using the site and find out the cost of diagnosis. </li></ol><br>  Now docdoc is already quite successfully functioning: we found the first few hundred doctors (they phoned the specialists personally and added pens to the database).  The first users also appeared - a competent seo makes itself felt: the site‚Äôs attendance is now 500 people per day. <br><br>  We are waiting for UFO guests, ready for constructive criticism and non-constructive praise) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143004/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143004/</a></p>
