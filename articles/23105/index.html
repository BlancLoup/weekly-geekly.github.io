  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Radiohead is an innovator in music distribution on the Internet.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The British group <a href="http://www.radiohead.com/">Radiohead</a> not only experiments with marketing techniques to spread their creativity on the Internet, but changes the principles of working with listeners in the network, makes the collective-listener relationships interactive to the limit and even makes the music industry work in new ways. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>Pay as much as you think is right.</strong> <br>  <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/FineOnMedia/archives/2007/10/radioheads_busi.html">The first step</a> was the sale of the new album In Rainbows under the revolutionary Pay-what-you-wish scheme.  Let me remind you that the scheme works as follows: the user pays for downloading the album in MP3 format, independently determining the price he is willing to pay (the maximum price was 99.99 pounds). <br><br>  Statistics provided by research company <a href="http://www.comscore.com/">comScore</a> showed that, without paying a penny, the new album downloaded 62% of the total number of people who downloaded music on Radiohead, the remaining 38% paid an average of $ 6 for In Rainbows. <br><br>  This move allowed group managers Bruce Edge (Bryce Edge) and Chris Hufford (Chris Hufford) to get the <a href="http://megas.guardianprofessional.co.uk/winners-innovator.aspx">title of innovators of the year</a> at the <a href="http://megas.guardianprofessional.co.uk/">MediaGuardian</a> awards <a href="http://megas.guardianprofessional.co.uk/">ceremony</a> , held in London.  According to the jury, the main merit of managers is that they broke stereotypes and changed the methods of music distribution through the Internet.

      <strong>Make us a video and make money.</strong> <br>  The next step to the title of the most progressive group of our time was a <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/radiohead_music_video_contest.php">video campaign</a> offered to Radiohead fans.  The essence of the action was that any fan of the group can make an animated video clip for the favorite song from the album In Rainbows, and participate in the competition with a prize fund of 20 thousand dollars. <br><br>  All works were evaluated by a competent team of judges, and as a result a dozen of the best clips were selected.  Each of the authors received $ 1,000 to create a minute video, and only one of the most worthy of these dozens received $ 10,000 remaining in the prize pool to create a full-fledged version of the video for their idols. <br><br>  <strong>What caused a large number of remakes in your work?</strong>  (c) Irina Aroyan <br>  A large number of remakes on the song of the group Radiohead - Nude is due to the fact that the group itself <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/radiohead_remix_contest.php">asked the</a> fans to do these remakes, which the latter began to do with enthusiasm.  In collaboration with <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> , Radiohead made it possible to create remixes for the song Nude. <br><br>  Those who decided to give a new sound to the song of their favorite group can purchase ready-made bass, vocal, guitar, sound effects and percussion tracks via iTunes Internet service.  Bought all five components before April 11 will receive a password to access the file in the format of the program <a href="http://www.apple.in.ua/ilife/garageband/">GarageBand</a> (software is available only under Mac OS X). <br><br>  Having finished creating the masterpiece, you need to put it on the site <a href="http://radioheadremix.com/">radioheadremix.com</a> , where until May 1 the voting for the best track will continue.  The winner will be rewarded with the fact that Radiohead will listen to his remix ... and, oddly enough, everything.  Controversial prize, but really, what is. <br><br>  To all, it became known that Radiohead is already thinking about recording a new album.  The group confirmed that the studio time for recording was already scheduled, and more than enough new material was collected. <br><br>  In this regard, natural questions arise: how the new album will be distributed, how it will be promoted, what actions the tireless managers of the Radiohead team will come up with after such a variety with the sensational In Rainbows. <br>  Let's hope that, having laid the foundation for innovations in the distribution and promotion of their music, Radiohead will not slip into the banal self-repetition and tailoring ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/23105/">https://habr.com/ru/post/23105/</a></p>
