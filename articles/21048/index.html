The first payments are listed, the stages of work are done ... <br><br>  And now you reach the last (Nth) stage, when your (already in principle the customer) ready (or not quite) product lies on the hosting, it has all the passwords, only one thing remains - to transfer the last (Nth) payment .

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Here the customer begins to behave strangely.  He does not answer calls (well, or answers ... times after the Nth), he behaves irritably with you, constantly gives new additions that absolutely (well, just absolutely) disagree with TK, ________ - here, as they say, put the right one. <br><br>  Well, in short, you understand (nothing about you?) That you will not receive the last payment from it (or maybe not the last one, maybe some N-th).  Here you think that even if you have a contract (and usually, we, freelancers, the complete absence of his presence) and it describes what will happen if one of the parties fails to fulfill the obligation ... but to go with such a piece of paper to court because for some, let's set for definiteness 10% of the total budget, as it is not serious (here, of course, in turn, everything depends on drawing up a contract).  In short, not worth the trouble with the court.  Well, if there is no agreement, then you have nowhere to go, no matter how much you would like. <br><br>  The question arises, ... even two!  Who is guilty?  What to do?  The eternal Russian questions. <br><br>  Who is to blame for you to decide.  Maybe you did not conscientiously do the work - the layout there was going away, or muscular eurors constantly got out, delayed the deadlines, disappeared from the customer‚Äôs sight, etc.  Or maybe just a customer reptile and decided to throw you, and maybe he had something wrong in life and he decided to break away from you, but maybe he has real problems and he needs to rake them and he stupidly has no money.  We should never forget about the last factor, all the same we are human beings. <br><br>  What to do - you need to defend yourself.  Put backdoors and other dirty tricks.  I will not argue (perhaps only now I will not) how to put these backdoors, etc.  I want to talk about how to do it so that the customer has nothing left but to either give you the last (N-th) part of the money, or stupidly go to order a new website. <br><br>  So, suppose that the ‚Äúevil‚Äù thing is already soldered into the code and cannot be detected (this is definitely worth writing a topic).  What should she do to cause maximum inconvenience to the customer. <br><br>  Just to fill up the site down is not good.  What for?  We are intelligent and witty people!  And most importantly sensible.  It will give nothing. <br><br>  The first thing that comes to mind (it is worth emphasizing what comes to my mind, and I am ashamed of it) is that instead of the site content, one word of three letters is displayed, the size of the whole screen.  But, this is not interesting.  A man comes in, sees it, snorts and leaves. <br><br>  Then comes the phrase you-you-know-who (tm) "Setkin, bitch, repay the debt!" (C).  Just bringing it to the whole page.  But it will happen the same as in the first case, and this is also not interesting.  But if it is displayed by a separate diva over the rest of the content, in small but red font, with an inscription like ‚ÄúThis company could not give the creators of the site total N rubles, although its approximate turnover is N * m rubles.  Are you sure you want to work with her? ‚Äù  This is more interesting. <br><br>  Go ahead.  What is most important in the site?  The most important thing is of course the content.  And the most important thing is how it is formatted and correctly written.  Got an idea?  We write a script that processes the contents and replaces ‚Äúcha‚Äù with ‚Äúchia‚Äù, ‚Äúdog‚Äù with ‚Äúsabak‚Äù, randomly sets the font sizes, their color and so on.  And it is possible and without formatting, errors on the site are still furious. <br><br>  You can not close the admin panel with a password, and throw off all the friends a link to it with a suggestion to potestit.  Instead of the company logo (or something there), you can put the logo of the main competitor and make a signature - ‚ÄúThey are the best!  Better order from them! ‚Äù <br><br>  What options of defense do you suggest, habra people? <br><br>  <strong>Habralyudi offer:</strong> <br>  <u>The panacea</u> is the <u>bkonst</u> comment that: <br>  ‚ÄúIt's easier to choose one of two options: <br>  - work through a conditional deposit / safe escrow; <br>  - keep the script on your server, install the customer only after payment. " <br><br>  An interesting comment from <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/spect/" class="user_link">SpeCT</a> that the last payout is some bonus, i.e.  The project budget is invested in n prepayments, and n + 1 is the premium that it determines itself.  <a href="http://zt50.habrahabr.ru/blog/36841.html">As he prescribes it in the estimate.</a> <a href="http://zt50.habrahabr.ru/blog/36841.html"><br></a> <br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/yakovf/" class="user_link">yakovf</a> suggests adding not good people to kidala.info arguing with a good indexing of this resource. <br><br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/joint/" class="user_link">joint has</a> <a href="http://zt50.habrahabr.ru/blog/36841.html">written a good negotiating model</a> with a customer if his needs exceed the TK. <br><br>  <strong>PS:</strong> And you know what the most annoying.  The most annoying thing is that after so many days of your labors ... these labors can go to the garbage.  Although you have invested your soul in it.  The most annoying is when nobody needs your work.  So this topic applies to not quite hopeless customers. <br><br>  <strong>PSS: this text is not plans for revenge.</strong>  <strong>there is no malice invested in it.</strong>  <strong>I just think you need to be protected from the scam.</strong>  <strong>maybe he will help someone?</strong>  <strong>who is already in this situation</strong> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21048/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21048/</a></p>
