But is it really and then what is the point in obtaining an ISTQB certificate?  Why obtaining a certificate may be more profitable for an employer than for a specialist?  Is ISTQB worth the time and money it will have to pay for its delivery?  We will try to find answers to these questions in the <b>first part of</b> our article on ISTQB certification. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  What is ISTQB, ISTQB certification levels and whether you need it </h2><br>  ISTQB is a non-profit organization that deals with the development of software testing, founded by representatives of 8 countries: Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands and the UK. <br><br>  ISTQB Tester Certification - a program that allows professionals to obtain an international certificate for testing. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.istqb.org/about-as/facts-figures.html">As of December 2018,</a> the ISTQB organization conducted 830,000+ examinations and issued more than 605,000+ certificates that are recognized in 126 countries of the world.

      That sounds great, right?  However, is certification really necessary?  What are the advantages of having a certificate for testing specialists and what opportunities does it offer? <br><br><h3>  Which ISTQB to choose? </h3><br>  First, let's look at the certification options for testing specialists.  ISTQB offers 3 levels of certification and 3 directions for each of the levels according to the matrix: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/db/lx/x8/dblxx8eb0cteynl3lc-rm_k7do4.png" alt="Quality-lab certificate ISTQB"></div><br><h4>  What you need to know about the choice of levels and directions: </h4><br>  <b>1. Foundation level (F) of the</b> <i>Core direction</i> - the basis for any higher level certificate. <br><br>  <b>2. Level F of the</b> <i>Specialist direction</i> - for it highly specialized certification is provided: usability, mobile application, performance, acceptance, model-based testing, etc. <br><br>  <b>3. Level F and Advanced (AD)</b> <i>Agile areas</i> - the demand for certificates of this type has increased by more than 20% over the past 2 years. <br><br>  <b>4. Level AD</b> - certification is provided for / by: <br>  - test managers; <br>  - test automation engineers; <br>  - test analytics; <br>  - technical test analytics; <br>  - security testing. <br><br>  <b>5. Expert level (EX)</b> - involves certification in the areas of test management and improvement of the testing process. <br><br>  By the way, when choosing certification levels for the direction you need, refer to the information of the main <a href="https://www.istqb.org/about-as/istqb-levels-and-modules.html">ISTQB</a> site, since  On the sites of providers there are inaccuracies in the description. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dd/pf/do/ddpfdocf5cnyiyuccmlvz_vqmyg.jpeg" alt="Quality-lab ISTQB level"></div><br><h3>  Talk about the benefits </h3><br><h4>  From the point of view of a Qa-specialist, certification is: </h4><br>  <b>1.</b> First of all, <b>confirmation of qualifications and professional suitability by</b> international experts in the field of testing, and this, in turn, provides access to new labor markets.  At the international level, the certificate is recognized in 126 countries of the world - a paradise for remote work or a prerequisite for relocation. <br><br>  <b>2. Improving competitiveness in the labor market:</b> although most employers do not require an ISTQB certificate from applicants, about 55% of test managers say they would like to have 100% certified personnel <a href="https://www.istqb.org/references/infographics/istqb-effectiveness-survey-2016-2017.html">(ISTQB_Effectiveness_Survey_2016-17 study)</a> . <br><br>  <b>3. Confidence in the future.</b>  The certificate does not guarantee top salary for employment or automatic promotion of work, but it is a kind of ‚Äúfireproof sum‚Äù, below which your work will not be assessed. <br><br>  <b>4. Expansion and systematization of knowledge in the field of QA.</b>  Certification is a great way for a QA specialist to increase and enrich the knowledge of testing.  And if you are an experienced tester, then update and streamline knowledge in the subject area, including through international standards and industry methodologies. <br><br><h4>  From the company's point of view, certification is: </h4><br>  <b>1. Additional competitive advantage in the market:</b> companies with a staff of certified experts are much less likely to provide low-quality consulting and QA services, which has a positive effect on the reputation and flow of new orders. <br><br>  <b>2. Bonus for participation in large tenders: the</b> availability of certified specialists gives an advantage to companies when participating in competitive selection in relation to tenders. <br><br>  <b>3. Risk reduction: the</b> presence of a certificate indicates that the specialists are proficient in testing methodology, and this reduces the risks of poor-quality test analysis and can increase the speed of testing by optimizing the number of test scenarios. <br><br>  <b>4. Advantages on the international market</b> in providing testing services for software intended for foreign customers and foreign software. <br><br>  <b>5. Growing competencies within the company</b> through mentoring and training non-certified professionals recognized international standards in the field of testing. <br><br>  For companies there are some more interesting bonuses and directions offered by ISTQB: <br><br>  <b><a href="https://awards.istqb.org/">1. ISTQB International Software Testing Excellence Award</a></b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oy/-j/9w/oy-j9wy5ppvu5ftsg7za1kr82ni.png" alt="Quality-lab International Software Testing Excellence Award"></div><br>  International Software Testing Award for outstanding long-term achievements in software quality, innovation, research and promotion of the software testing profession. <br><br>  Award winners - experts in the field of testing and development, the authors of research, new approaches to testing. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://partner.istqb.org/">2.

Opinions of specialists from different countries: </h3><br>  <b>And what do experts in the field of software testing and development from the USA and Europe think:</b> <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúCreative thinking is more valuable than certification.</i>  <i>In a hiring situation, I usually prefer a person who has the most direct experience, instead of a certified specialist.</i>  <i>In addition, if certification of a certified specialist does not add value to work, it becomes a negative indicator for me rather than a positive one. ‚Äù</i> <br>  <b>Joe Coley Mendon, Massachusetts.</b> <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúCertificates can help in selecting the best part of specialists in the labor market, from which you can then choose a subset that really meets all the requirements.</i>  <i>Certificates are not a panacea for problems with recruitment and will not be a reliable, iron guarantee that an employee has the necessary skills. ‚Äù</i> <br>  <b>Debashish Chakrabarti, Sweden.</b> <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúDoes having a certificate mean that the project manager is a good specialist?</i>  <i>Not.</i>  <i>Does this mean that he is interested in wasting time on himself and promoting the profession through continuous education and participation?</i>  <i>Yes".</i> <br>  <b>Riley Horan St. Paul, Minnesota</b> <br><br>  <b><a href="https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/feature/Certification-pros-and-cons-Readers-speak-out">Link to the original article with reviews.</a></b> <br><br><h3>  3. What happens in the labor market: is certification necessary in the field of testing when applying for a job? </h3><br>  We took as a basis publicly available data on vacancies with <b>LinkedIn</b> and analyzed the ratio of requirements for certification of specialists in the field of testing to the total number of vacancies in the field of testing. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cm/hx/o2/cmhxo2vatk77emaldw6vz83ypm8.png" alt="Quality-lab certification in ISTQB countries"></div><br><br><h4>  Observations on LinkedIn labor market analysis: </h4><br><ol><li>  In most cases, certification is <b>not a</b> requirement when applying for a job as a testing specialist. </li><li>  Although certification is issued indefinitely, there are <b>requirements for restrictions on the time of</b> receipt of the certificate in the vacancies (Certified ISTQB Foundation level). </li><li>  Applicants applying for jobs with high qualifications in specialized areas of testing are required to have a cherished piece of paper: <b>self-testing, test analysis, test management, senior QA.</b> </li><li>  ISTQB is <b>not the only</b> certification option, equivalents are allowed. </li></ol><br><h2>  findings </h2><br>  Certification can be a requirement for individual companies or on government projects.  When deciding whether to obtain an ISTQB certificate, you should focus on the following realities: <br><br><ol><li>  When choosing a candidate for the position of specialist in testing, <b>experience and knowledge</b> will be decisive, and not a certificate.  Although in the presence of similar skills, preference will be given to a certified specialist. </li><li>  Certification helps in career development (for 90% of managers, it is important to have 50-100% of certified testers in a team), in addition, in some foreign companies obtaining a certificate is a <b>pretext for salary increase</b> . </li><li>  Certification helps to increase your <b>self-reliance</b> .  It also helps you develop the ability to think about things from different angles, you grow as a specialist. </li></ol><br>  <b>In the first part of our article,</b> we tried to answer the question: ‚ÄúIs the ISTQB certificate really necessary?‚Äù;  and if so, to whom, which one and why.  We hope that the article was useful to you.  Write in the comments - have any new horizons opened to you after receiving the certificate or, in your opinion, ISTQB is another useless piece of paper. <br><br>  <b>In the second part of the article,</b> QA-engineers of the Quality Laboratory, <b>Anna Paley</b> and <b>Pavel Tolokonin</b> , will tell you personally how they were prepared, registered, tested and received ISTQB certificates in Russia and abroad.  Subscribe and follow new publications. <br><br>  <b>Anna Paley</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Test manager of the company "Quality Laboratory".</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/450748/">https://habr.com/ru/post/450748/</a></p>
