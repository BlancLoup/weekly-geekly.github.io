Without claiming the ultimate truth, let us try to dot the i and clarify at least the basic things. <br><br>  So what is a ‚Äúsales script‚Äù?  The etymology of the term speaks for itself - this is an algorithm for making a sale.  For clarity, we recall the pipeline in its original form, when operations were performed not by robots, but by humans - each person performs a certain strictly regulated operation.  What gave the pipeline from the point of view, to use the Marxist terminology, the productive forces?  Labor has become more technological and, accordingly, less ‚Äúcreative‚Äù, subject to subjective factors. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Essentially, the same idea is in the sales scripts - to technologize the sales process, which breaks down into certain stages, in each of which it is necessary to perform a certain (speech) operation, starting with a greeting, ending with the final result, whether it is the fact of sale , appointment, lead.  The goal is to optimize the sales process, eliminate the influence of the human factor, increase efficiency, optimize labor costs (training scripts allows you to hire less experienced and qualified personnel, and not be afraid of sales rotation - the result, as a rule, does not suffer). <br><br>  Simply put, a sale script is a sales process, broken down into specific steps, each with a specific spelled speech pattern.  Each stage comes after a certain verbal reaction of the client.  All possible client reactions are typologized, so it‚Äôs easy to follow the script, ‚Äúforce majeure‚Äù is almost completely out of the bracket.

      So, if you decide to systematize the work of sales managers and implement scripts, you should start by assessing the current quality of the department‚Äôs work. <br><br>  Requirements for sales managers can be divided into three main groups: general skills of communication and presentation of information, knowledge of the structure of the conversation and the ability to present products for sale.  Consider them in more detail: <br><br>  <b>Empathy with the client</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The manager should ensure smooth interaction throughout the entire conversation, setting a respectful tone of voice from the very first phrases. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The client should feel a sincere desire to solve his problem. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Competent salesman speech will show the cultural level of your company. <br>  ‚Ä¢ In response to customer responses, it is necessary to adjust to them, changing the volume of the voice, etc.  Clients are not always in a good mood, but the manager must remain benevolent and not interrupt. <br><br>  <b>Structure / stages of negotiations</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The manager should be able to properly present the product, know the main stages of the negotiations. <br>  ‚Ä¢ It is important to clearly convey to the client the purpose of the conversation and be well versed in the arguments about the benefits of the product. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The client must realize that you can solve his problem. <br><br>  <b>Sale</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Go to the sales unit, preferably, delicately transfer the topic of conversation from abstract to business. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The customer must be fully informed about your product / service. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The manager should be ready to work out typical objections, as well as active listening to the client. <br>  ‚Ä¢ If the sale did not take place, the manager should thank the client and tell where to find information about the company. <br><br>  Scripts allow your managers to sell and respond to emerging situations equally effectively.  Having worked through the stages of conversation, even beginners have a low risk of losing customers.  Plus, constantly gaining practical experience, they will become real specialists much faster.  Of course, this is a very generalized structure, but it reflects the main steps used, including  professional consultants on the organization of sales, albeit in a greatly expanded form. <br><br>  After all, a professional sales department is an increase in trust in your company, a positive impact on the image, an increase in the number of customers and, consequently, sales. <br><br>  Together with Dmitry Dolya, commercial director of Mokselle </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293532/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293532/</a></p>
