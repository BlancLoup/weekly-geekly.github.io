  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Coworking. St. Petersburg. New information</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h2>  Introduction </h2><br>  Once again, welcome habroskoobschestvo! <br><br>  Not so long ago, I wrote that I was going to open a co-working center in St. Petersburg and asked for your opinion on where it should be.  Now I am ready to talk about what will be and where. <br><br><h2>  Location </h2><br>  The co-working center will be open at the end of Ligovsky Avenue, about one kilometer from the station.  m. "Moscow Gate".  In my opinion, this is a reasonable compromise between the cost of rent and distance from the center and from the metro.  There is a guarded parking.  There is a cafe where you can have lunch for reasonable money (lunch costs 100-150 rubles) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Capacity </h2><br>  The office is designed for 45 people.  Two ordinary large halls and one small one will work for premium clients, behind which their place will be fixed (and where you can place the desktop on a permanent basis).  Two halls will not allow to collect very many people in the same square (to avoid unnecessary noise and crowds), but at the same time they kill the problem of small rooms for 3-5 people.

    <h2>  Working hours </h2><br>  It will be possible to come to the co-working center around the clock, 7 days a week - our office manager will always be there.  However, it is necessary to agree on work at night a little in advance (no later than 16 hours of the day on which you want to work at night) - this is due to the security service that serves the premises.  Speaking of her. <br><br><h2>  Security </h2><br>  The security of the building is provided by its own security service (extra departmental security guard works in addition).  Video surveillance is carried out, the entrance to the building is by personal magnetic passes, or by temporary passes, for which you must present a passport or driver's license.  In general, security is provided at the highest level.  Directly in the office, you can get a personal cell, locked with a key and keep everything there that your heart desires. <br><br><h2>  What will be in the office? </h2><br>  The coworking center consists of three rooms for work (two large and one small), a rest room, two meeting rooms, a small kitchen, and a toilet.  Of course, at your service are wired and wireless Internet (unlimited), telephone (you can get your personal number), marker boards, a projector in one of the meeting rooms, a microwave oven, a kettle, a water cooler, and office equipment (printer-scanner-fax -copy). <br><br><h2>  How much is? </h2><br>  There are several tariff plans at your service: you can come for one day - it will cost 800 rubles (the tariff is focused primarily on business travelers or those who just want to try coworking), there is a night tariff (unlimited visits from 23.00 to 11.00 month) - it will cost you 3000 rubles a month;  if you need to work all week, or you are going to come very rarely, then it makes sense for you to purchase the ‚ÄúEpisodic‚Äù tariff for 5,000 rubles (7 days within a month);  for regular customers there are two tariffs - unlimited for a month (without a fixed place, but with the possibility of booking) for 8000 rubles and premium - with a fixed workplace and discounts for additional.  services for 11,000 rubles.  In special cases, special conditions can be discussed. <br><br><h2>  How is the payment organized? </h2><br>  We will work with you under a service agreement that you can sign in our office.  After that, you pay the required amount either in cash directly at the office, or you transfer it to your account in the most convenient way (including Yandex.Money or WebMoney). <br><br><h2>  When? </h2><br>  I would not venture to call the exact date of the opening, but I am pretty sure that this will happen before the end of May.  Keep for updates :) <br><br><h2>  Questions? </h2><br>  You can ask questions in this topic.  Answers are guaranteed. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24500/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24500/</a></p>
