  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How much can a beginner earn on YouTube in 2015?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Your site - these are your rules, but also completely your problems with its development.  15 SEO experts in the <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/meedget/blog/14262/">previous article</a> indicated the reasons preventing the promotion of new resources.  A simple mistake - and the advent of traffic is postponed indefinitely.  And along with it - and the planned income.  But you can use for earnings and other people's sites that do not need to promote!  And sometimes making money with their help turns out even faster for a beginner ... Consider the nuances of attracting traffic from the second most visited site in the World - YouTube.com.  And Denis Konovalov (konoden) will help us in this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e3a/432/ce2/e3a432ce2efb4187a7da94cfff310938.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Denis has been working with YouTube since 2009.  The income screens of some of his channels, which he laid out on the website, were ‚Äúgurus of the coaches Yutub 80 leveled‚Äù quickly taken off the network and are still used as examples of real earnings ... $ 6478.67 from one channel of Denis on the subject of humor.  From this figure it is still necessary to subtract 20% (income of the medianet), but even without that the amount is quite good. <br><br>  Denis claims that even in the crisis year of 2015, even a newcomer will reach the level of income from $ 1,000 to $ 4,000 in 3 months.  This is when working with the YouTube affiliate program through the media network using other people's videos ...

      But after all, traffic from YouTube channels can and should be redirected to sites.  And here the earnings figures can be several times higher ... Of course, a small percentage of viewers who are looking at cutting jokes or pranks will be transferred to the site of house construction specialists.  Yes, and place your order!  But Aleksei Zemskov, recording thematic clips from professional apartment renovators, just got more fame and popularity as the number one specialist in Podolsk. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ab/6a5/a9e/7ab6a5a9e83d424faa2224bcfaebf6b3.jpg"><br><br>  <b>To find out the prospects and clarify the situation on earnings on YouTube in 2015, we took a short interview with Denis ...</b> <br><br>  <b>How much can a newbie earn on YouTube, what investments and prospects?</b> <br>  For a simple person who is just starting to work with YouTube and is working correctly, this development will be: <br><ol><li>  The first month of work - earnings 0 $.  By the end of the month, he will connect the channel to the media network.  This is a preparatory period of work. </li><li>  The second month of work - earnings from $ 100 to $ 1,000 on average (depending on the subject, intensity and efficiency of work).  Time required 1-2 hours per day. </li><li>  The third month of work - earnings from 1000 to 4000 dollars on average. </li></ol><br>  You are optimizing your income and you already understand which videos make you money most effectively. <br>  This is what concerns the earnings on other people's videos (gray channels).  On the author's channels, the situation is different and there everything will depend on the quality of the video, the subject and the effectiveness of working with the channel.  For channels with other people's videos, it is not difficult to select high-quality videos that will collect views. <br><br>  <b>What content is better to choose a newbie: the author or someone else?</b> <br>  Alien content is a high risk, but usually faster, bigger and easier to get revenue.  Author content - more labor, longer channel development, but low risk of a ban.  The channel with the author's content can be connected to Adsense, the channel with other people's videos is better to monetize through the media network.  If a person is creative and wants to record video - he can try to create author's content.  If a person has found a topic that interests him, but he cannot create a video or does not want to - it‚Äôs worth working with other people's videos. <br><br>  <b>What is the strategy of work: do 100-200 channels and fill thousands of videos or 1-2 channels with an emphasis on quality?</b> <br>  I am a supporter of development strategy with an emphasis on quality.  No matter what channel it is: author or gray.  My strategy is this: I create several channels in different niches.  I upload 30-50 videos to them and leave them to gain trust.  Actively working on the development of 1-2 channels, pulling up a little bit on others.  But gray content is unofficial, so in case of problems on the main channel, I switch to the spare ones ... <br><br>  <b>What are the most promising niches in 2015?</b> <br>  These are cartoons, melodramas and films, humor and jokes.  Trend of Spring 2015 - news in Ukraine and pranka.  By the way, news channels are one of the safest in terms of getting copyright strikes.  For example, all materials from the Kremlin site are licensed under the Creative Commons license, allowing legal use of video for commercial purposes.  There are other popular niches in which you can absolutely earn money on other people's videos.  If readers are interested, I can prepare a review of niches with an analysis of income, strike risk, competition, and work complexity. <br><br>  <b>And what to do in case of strikes or ban channel?</b>  <b>In addition, there are also cases where strikes are ‚Äúthrown‚Äù not only by copyright holders, but also by claimants who do not have copyright to this video.</b>  <b>Or the channel is blocked due to violations that were not ...</b> <br>  If the channel is banned illegally, then you need to submit a restoration request: <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/contact/suspended">support.google.com/accounts/contact/suspended</a> .  Unfortunately, some channel owners for some reason think that they definitely need to write in English, and their request is unlikely to be considered.  Therefore, they do nothing ... <br><br>  If the channel is in the media network, you need to write in support and ask for help.  Of course, if you are sure that you are right and did not use someone else's video. <br><br>  Strikes can be challenged by submitting a counter notification.  If the strike is legal - there is an opportunity to agree on its withdrawal by contacting the copyright holder.  By the way, foreign authors are more willing to meet the violators. <br><br>  <b>Everyone knows about the value of VKontakte, Twitter, Facebook, but the social network Google+ is rarely used to promote on YouTube and Google.</b>  <b>How to effectively use this tool?</b> <br>  The task at least is to create your own plus page associated with the channel.  And post entries on it.  Create a circle of TOP fans on the channel and get feedback from them, ask for their opinion, hold online meetings with them.  Here is a good example of promoting a company's image in the Google ecosystem: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/212/bbf/151/212bbf15199d4c78aa7d9af387a7f600.jpg"><br><br>  You also need to create circles and communities on Google+.  The effect will not keep you waiting! <br><br>  <b>What are some of the major mistakes that prevent YouTube from moving?</b> <br>  The main mistake is the approach ‚Äúand it‚Äôs okay‚Äù, he himself is sinful and I often do this ... This is non-system work with the channel, ignoring aspects of video optimization, quantity instead of quality, unwillingness to analyze statistics and make adjustments to the development of the channel.  More mistakes: misunderstanding of the target audience (its interests), lack of imagination and creativity, copying other people's channels without changes. <br><br>  <b>Which videos are ranked best: what to look for when preparing videos?</b> <br>  The main ranking factor is the indicator of audience retention.  The longer the average time to watch a video and the more people watch it to the end, the higher YouTube puts this video in the list.  It is not the number of views that is important, but the total retention of the audience.  The more interesting and better the video, the easier it is to promote it in the search.  The technical side of optimization is largely taken from classic SEO, because the video viewing page is a web document.  YouTube's algorithms are still largely based on the principles of search engines 5-7 years old. <br><br>  The topic is extensive, if you are interested - I will make a checklist for the preparation and casting of videos, taking into account the basic principles of YouTube-SEO. <br><br>  <b>How does video ranking depend on the number of videos and subscribers?</b>  <b>What are the minimum indicators to strive for?</b>  <b>And is it worth while using services markups?</b> <br>  There is no direct relationship, but these are all interrelated factors.  Older and more active channels have more videos and subscribers, there is a regular audience that is involved in the promotion of content.  If there are a lot of active subscribers on the channel, they will watch the videos to the end, creating a good retention rate for the audience.  And this is the basis for a good video ranking.  I do not recommend using the services of cheating. <br><br>  <b>How effective is video ads on YouTube?</b>  <b>What are the trends in Russia in 2015?</b> <br>  Over the past 2 years, the volume of the advertising market on YouTube in Russia has increased by 51%.  In 2015, due to the crisis, there was a decline in the dollar, but the statistics in rubles is stable.  Video advertising is the most effective type of advertising.  A video can more fully represent a product or service than a text or a picture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b9/d10/a0e/4b9d10a0e2264e03b6d53f141f33e26c.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Should the company's channel be connected to the media network?</b> <br>  If you plan to create a large channel, then the media network will be useful.  She will appoint a personal manager who will solve the main issues, help with optimization, with the purchase of advertising and promotion. <br>  In addition, the media network puts your videos in similar (on the right side of the page and on the viewing screen after the completion of the video).  The media network guarantees that the top 4 positions in similar videos will be taken by videos from your channel.  Due to this, the number of views increases.  Also, after the <i>first</i> strike, as a rule (!), Additional features of the channel are not disabled (you can upload videos for more than 15 minutes, put external links and personalized icons). <br><br>  Cons - customers watch ads and think that the company is kind of petty.  Take the same popular channel Alexei Zemskov, which is categorically against affiliate.  But you can connect affiliate, and advertising does not even include.  At the same time you get all the benefits of connecting to the medianet. <br><br>  <b>How not to drain traffic from YouTube for nothing and to use annotations correctly?</b> <br>  There are several ways to output traffic from YouTube to your website: <br><ol><li>  From the video viewing page: link in description, annotation with link, user prompt, overlay, site mention in the video itself + call to action. </li><li>  From the channel as a whole: you can add links to sites on the About Channel page, they will be displayed in the channel header.  Also, a call to action can be placed in the description text on the ‚ÄúAbout the channel‚Äù page and in the description of playlists. </li></ol><br><br>  How to use annotations?  First of all, remember about the technical features of YouTube and do not make such mistakes: <br><ol><li>  External links in video annotations can only be put on sites linked to a YouTube channel (tricks can be circumvented using tricks, but we will not violate YouTube‚Äôs rules, right?). </li><li>  Annotations placed in the bottom of the channel's trailer player window can be overlaid by the video scroll bar, and in the right-hand side with a channel icon.  This will make it impossible to click on such an annotation and follow the link. </li><li>  Annotations do not work on mobile devices.  Custom hints work on all devices. </li><li>  Do not overlap with annotations the main part of the screen with information, this may cause irritation among viewers. </li><li>  The link leading to the site should be made visible: the abstract should contrast well with the background of the video, the text on it should be well read.  The link in the description should duplicate the annotation and be located in the first two sentences of the description. </li><li>  Do not be intrusive, you do not need to force the audience to click on the link, open your website or place an order. </li><li>  When ordering ads on foreign YouTube-channels, annotations with a transition to your site will not work if the channel is not tied to the site.  Therefore, you need to put a link in the description of the video, and in the video itself, the presenter should say: ‚ÄúFollow the link in the description of this video‚Äù + at this moment makes the corresponding gesture. </li></ol><br><blockquote>  <b>Recommendations.</b>  Track statistics in YouTube Analytics, look for CTRs, closures and annotation clicks, and tips. </blockquote><br>  <b>And yet, the annotations have a lot of technical issues:</b> <br><ol><li>  <b>Where to install them?</b> </li><li>  <b>What to write in the text annotations?</b>  <b>There is a theory that when watching a video, a person is so involved that direct calls to action work best: click, click, etc.</b> </li><li>  <b>Font and annotation parameters: color range of letters and background.</b> </li><li>  <b>Duration and time of installation annotations ...</b> </li></ol><br><br>  Well, I'll record a short video with answers to questions about the effective use of annotations.  Only it is necessary to take into account that in this example I will put the ‚ÄúSubscribe‚Äù annotation in the upper right corner - this is for a regular video. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/66d/81c/c7e/66d81cc7e8d74d36889f761ef59200a8.jpg"><br><br>  But for the channel trailer, such annotation will overlap with player elements.  This will make clicking on it impossible. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/PX-S1eKjcjI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgaNX1V40Hj1Gvmtw2IVl6Ftna9mA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>And, of course, the main question of this interview: how to earn on YouTube a lot and for a long time?)</b> <br>  Create your own studio for the production of cartoons, as does Dmitry Komarov. <br><br>  We will thank our interlocutor for the answers and recommendations.
