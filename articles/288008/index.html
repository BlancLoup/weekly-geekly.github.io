  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Signs that you're too addicted to blogging</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, one of the most famous bloggers on the Internet, Michael Arrington, <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/lenta/1625/">went on a two-month vacation</a> .  As he himself said, the reason was banal fatigue.  Christmas holidays Arrington is going to spend in the parental home and go skiing.  Here is a great example for many other bloggers who give their passion to the last force. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Life in the blogosphere is extremely demanding, time consuming, exhausting morally and physically.  Darren Rose, author of <a href="http://www.problogger.net/">Problogger</a> , knows it like no other.  Today, he published a list of eight <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2006/12/07/8-signs-it-might-be-time-to-take-a-break-from-blogging/">signs of over-enthusiasm for blogging</a> .  If you have one or more of these signs - you probably should think about vacation too.  Although used for a few days, or even a month or two. <br><br> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/glindsay65/260323143/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/8d0/1e3/2a7/8d01e32a77c73d2fecd92147ac352362.jpg" width="450" height="300" alt="Tired of blogging? Take a vacation!"></a> <br><br>  1. The first sign of excessive blogging - if you have a <b>shortage of topics</b> , mental blocking.  You stupidly look at the empty screen for an hour and are not able to squeeze out a single line.  If you have nothing to say, then it is better not to say anything. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      2. If <b>you</b> want to write <b>about everything</b> in your blog.  You look at the events around as potential topics for a blog post.  This is the flip side of mental blocking, but equally symptomatic.  You start thinking about your blog at breakfast, even talking to your wife becomes a reason to publish.  If this happened to you, it may be better to distract from blogging and do some ordinary life. <br><br>  3. If blogging <b>interferes with family life</b> .  It would seem obvious, but, oddly enough, there are many people whose family life is very close to the catastrophe because of blogging. <br><br>  4. If you have <b>unrealistic dreams</b> .  This is one of the problems of the blogosphere: it gives its ‚Äúslaves‚Äù absolutely fantastic expectations about how blogging can change their lives.  Constantly there are all the new characters who seek to become "professional" bloggers. <br><br>  5. If blogging is <b>bad for health</b> .  Sometimes the body itself gives unambiguous signals that you are overly enthusiastic.  Eyes crawl on the forehead and turn red, so that even the "vizin" stops helping.  My back hurts, my neck goes numb, the constant noise in my head is the warning that the body sends. <br><br>  6. If you are attracted to the blog <b>on the weekend</b> , it already speaks of obvious addiction.  If you can not allow a day without updating the blog, then write a message in advance, and rest on a day off. <br><br>  7. If you are pulling <b>while on vacation</b> .  There are also such bloggers who can not stop even on vacation.  In a foreign city, at the resort, they are looking for a hot spot or an Internet cafe, as a drug addict is looking for a dose. <br><br>  8. If <b>sleep is disturbed</b> .  Some bloggers prefer graphomania at night when normal people sleep.  Of course, this adversely affects brain activity.  Perhaps it is better to go to bed, and in a dream new ideas will surely come to mind. <br><br>  Of course, the signs listed by Darren Rose are far from a complete list.  For example, the well-known blogger Robert Scoble instantly responded with an ‚Äúappendix‚Äù of his own composition of <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2006/12/06/signs-youve-been-blogging-too-much/">eight additional points</a> . <br><br>  By the way, one of the signs of addiction according to Scoble is when a blogger publishes entries dedicated to blogging.  Here it is right to the point. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288008/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288008/</a></p>
