  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Internet distances</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We live in a wonderful time, when it takes less than a day to fly around the world, and roads and railways connect all the land.  There are no significant differences between civilized countries and visa regimes are quite humane.  It would seem that there are no barriers to true freedom, freedom of movement and life!  But ... No ... The fur animal crept from where it was not expected - from the web. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It so happened that in recent years I have been flying around the world a lot, working in different countries and, of course, using the benefits of Internet civilization.  And it so happened that on these journeys the web most often leads to WTF !!!  with pulling out hair from the most bizarre places. <br><br>  I will be brief, I will go straight to the 4 main problems of the international web, for me personally, the most visible and frequently encountered. <br><br>  <b>1. Automatic installation of the interface language.</b>  A good, in general, idea, brought to the state of the cancer industry by the hands of web programmers and designers.  Most sites and services that switch language according to IP, browser language or serial number of the first battery bank do not have a clear way to get the language back.  It's so easy and logical to make the language menu ONLY in English (and not in the current language), mark the languages ‚Äã‚Äãwith flags, mnemonics, pictures!  Place this menu in a standard and expected place.  Finally, after logging into your account, switch to the language that the owner specified in the settings!  Perhaps I want too much ... But the fact remains that I flew to Ethiopia, learn Amharic! <br>  Not the worst, but a case in point - aliexpress.com.  Despite billions of dollars still does not have an intelligible change of languages, it gives out a search in the language of the country of location and wanted to spit on the account settings.

      <b>2. Binding to the country.</b>  This is a google stone.  Have you tried changing the country in the playmarket?  Try, fascinating.  In reality, the situation is such that when you arrive in the country, some of its applications and services become unavailable (white applications do not work on black electrons!).  And you have to re-register the playmarket again, losing the purchased applications, fooling around with redirection from the old mail, etc.  Alas, oh, a single Google account does not work.  If at least in one place there is an old address, phone number or bank card of another country, the change of country will not work without an explanation of the reasons.  Still, the passion for bicycles has played a cruel joke with them - they do not take into account the possibility of crossing large distances ... <br><br>  <b>3. Linking to national phone numbers.</b>  Here we have a leader - Yandex!  Having a strikingly similar password recovery system with Google, binds an account only to a Russian phone.  Well done.  I got abroad several times when Yandex suddenly decided that they were breaking me and peremptorily demanded SMS to the associated number.  It is very funny when in Russia it is 3 am, and you urgently need to answer an important letter in a locked box.  A number of Latin American services are simply cut down if you try to get to them not from the local IP.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsome messengers to tie a person to a phone number also turns out to be a big problem for pilgrims like me.  Having changed the number to the national one, I have to notify the entire contact list, and then catch letters like ‚Äúwhat do not answer?‚Äù From those who missed the notification. <br><br>  By the way, special thanks to the wise comrade Yandex for the inability to use the password again.  I myself would never figure out where and what level of security I use. <br><br>  <b>4. Routing, digital signatures, etc.</b>  Also a big problem.  Services may not work abroad (Yandex disk, for example, falls off in most countries where I was due to the excess number of hops to the server), foreign mail is filtered by spam filters (both from Russian mailboxes and vice versa), which makes correspondence difficult with foreigners.  DKIM and others are useless.  Landing sites hosted on Russian servers are a priori losing to them, but on the servers of the country where the search is being performed, etc. <br><br>  Unfortunately, my experience says that, contrary to any logic, the Internet is the source of most problems in international activities.  You can set up production connections in a short time at a new location, change the delivery addresses of components from suppliers and register a company, but for the same amount of time you will set up intermediate mailboxes, butt with interfaces and transfer processes to new clouds.  The Internet today, alas, is not at all the global web, but a conglomeration of local formations that communicate poorly with each other. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398001/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398001/</a></p>
