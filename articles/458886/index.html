  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The most useful reports of Mail.ru Design Conf √ó Dribbble Meetup 2019 according to True Engineering</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the end of June, a large conference on the design of Mail.ru Design Conf √ó Dribbble Meetup 2019 was held in Moscow. Records from the broadcast are already online, so we chose the most interesting reports to make it easier for you to navigate.  We will tell about them in more detail in the article. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lo/g7/rp/log7rpgwi9rhg9l1ud5jqcfcbew.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Maxim Zhestkov - Path and Tools ( <a href="https://youtu.be/HCzmE1FxKhU%3Ft%3D296">recording of the report</a> ) </h3><br>  <a href="https://zhestkov.studio/">Maxim Zhestkov</a> , a motion designer from Ulyanovsk, opened the conference.

      First of all, he is known for his works, which themselves are so steep that Max receives orders for installing installations in an office or a hotel (it looks fascinatingly realistic).  However, until now the artist has not talked about his principles. <br><br>  The more interesting was to listen to his first public speech at the conference.  The report is a frank essay about the path of a designer, the search for inspiration and following one‚Äôs own creative principles. <br><br>  After the report, it becomes clear that a cool project begins with a strong idea. <br><br><h3>  Design team Tinkoff ( <a href="https://youtu.be/HCzmE1FxKhU%3Ft%3D3465">record report</a> ) </h3><br>  This is the first public performance of the Tinkoff design team.  It turned out very detailed: from the portrait of the employee to the daily changes of the whale.  Dense, we can say the ultimate report.  Maximum in the case. <br><br>  They showed the workflow using the example of developing a personal Internet bank account.  The report will be primarily interested in product teams working and developing the design system (the spoiler is two UI whales in Tinkoff). <br><br>  The presentation gives a simple and concise explanation of why it is worthwhile to abandon the public library of components: for visitors this is a one-time introductory view, for the team - constant support and updates. <br><br><h3>  Oleg Frolov - Interface Experiments ( <a href="https://youtu.be/HCzmE1FxKhU%3Ft%3D7867">recording a report</a> ) </h3><br>  Firstly, it is beautiful.  <a href="https://dribbble.com/Volorf">Oleg</a> showed a showcase of his works. <br><br>  Secondly, Oleg's projects are an excellent example of solving a non-trivial task in the interface. <br><br>  We can not call the speech of Oleg instructions for use.  Rather, it‚Äôs an arbitrary essay and reflection on how interface and interaction can be. <br><br>  Separately, we recommend the report because of the story about the pet project.  Oleg advises not to use the technologies that slow you down, not to dig in and release it in a day.  Such a project helps the designer to understand what development is and to get endorphins from the completed work. <br><br><h3>  Pavel Laptev and Alexander Artsvuni (Farfetch) - Evolution of prototyping ( <a href="https://youtu.be/HCzmE1FxKhU%3Ft%3D9693">recording of the report</a> ) </h3><br>  A powerful demo of the designers of the mobile team Farfetch design automation, prototyping and working with engineers. <br><br>  Five reasons to watch the report: <br><ul><li>  If you want to get away from the development of design specifications and documentation for product design, </li><li>  If you want to shorten the development cycle from three sprints to one, </li><li>  If you want to get closer to the release version, </li><li>  If you want to unite an international team, </li><li>  If in your team each designer is an engineer, and an engineer is a designer. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Andrey Shugalsky ( <a href="https://youtu.be/HCzmE1FxKhU%3Ft%3D12581">recording of the report</a> ) </h3><br>  This typography and 3D design, which have gone very far. <br><br>  It is curious that before Andrew worked in Qiwi and dealt with interfaces. <br><br>  In Qiwi, there was no demand for limitless visual creativity, but in Roketbank, all of Andrei‚Äôs visuals and conceptuals went to the prod. <br><br>  His report is not about product design and development.  Visual sugar, grotesque and endless experiment on the images of Andrew speak for him.  Speech - the answer to the question of why businesses need key images and animations on the verge of a foul. <br><br><h3>  Acronis design team ( <a href="https://youtu.be/HCzmE1FxKhU%3Ft%3D15499_">record report</a> ) </h3><br>  Acronis delivered a report on several areas: branding, communications, interfaces.  His team is responsible for the entire design: Digital, Brand, Event, Product.  In the report, they share their experience of working together in several time zones and projects how to make a recognizable style. <br><br>  An important emphasis in the report is placed on the responsibility of the designer in a project with a large release cycle.  The peculiarity of the product team is a long development cycle.  Therefore, it is important to work everything out so as not to make edits every week. <br><br>  From the report you will learn: <br><ul><li>  how to maintain consistency among the company's products and communications </li><li>  how to localize illustration without fakapov </li><li>  and extend a single branded storyline to different products and solutions. </li></ul><br><h3>  Mail.ru - Rebranding and conference style ( <a href="https://youtu.be/HCzmE1FxKhU%3Ft%3D23994">report writing</a> ) </h3><br>  Mail.ru told about his first major rebranding in 18 years of the company's existence.  Rebranding also coincided with the redesign of the mail.  The TK of this rebranding looked like this: it was necessary to preserve the loyalty of regular users and attract a new young audience.  And do not fall under the suspicion that she shoved naphthalene.  New blue color brand tested on focus groups. <br><br>  A curious fact: rebranding was a competition between teams.  The work was conducted simultaneously by different teams, internal and external, in order to form an objective solution space.  The result was a successive solution that can be applied to the entire ecosystem of the company. <br><br>  It was also interesting to hear about double diamond - a design model that was actively used in the formation of the solution space. <br><br><h3>  QIWI - How to be a paint drip designer ( <a href="https://youtu.be/HCzmE1FxKhU%3Ft%3D30343">talk</a> ) </h3><br>  The Qiwi team argues that it is and is not within the competence and responsibilities of the designer.  For example, the requirements for a professional were texts, analytics, business understanding and research-based work.  However, Qiwi changes the paradigm: a deep immersion of the designer in these topics is a plus, and not multitasking due to inept management. <br><br>  Qiwi also introduced the Growth Team, which independently generates hypotheses and tests them to create insights.  We all understand that activity is useful.  So it will be curious to follow their work and find out what will come of it. <br><br>  Also in the report is an interesting story by Kati Lavrentieva, designer of ‚ÄúConscience‚Äù, who shares her research experience and interviews with users.  A lot of practice and benefit. <br><br><h3>  Superdesigners Studio ( <a href="https://youtu.be/HCzmE1FxKhU%3Ft%3D32778">recording report</a> ) </h3><br>  Do you remember that the full title of the conference Mail.ru Design Conf √ó Dribbble Meetup 2019?  For the second part ‚Äúsuperdesigners‚Äù fully answered.  Speech - review without details. <br><br>  About the process to learn something is unlikely to succeed, but aesthetic pleasure is guaranteed to get. <br><br><h3>  Lastly useful link </h3><br>  Designer Sasha Okunev <a href="https://medium.com/slashdesigner/mail-conf-2019-e26becb1087d">also talks</a> about the first part of the conference and the most interesting reports. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/458886/">https://habr.com/ru/post/458886/</a></p>
