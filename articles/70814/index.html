  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Jogging: good sport for an IT person or how to start running</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Everyone knows that IT specialists, in their majority, lead a sedentary lifestyle.  Almost all the working time they spend on their 5th point.  This is clearly not good for health.  And if we take into account the fact that the diet of an average IT person is quite harmful to the body, then as a result, everyone is expected: overweight, muscle atrophy, and all sorts of "minor troubles" (like hemorrhoids and impotence).  In this article I will talk about the benefits of regular physical exertion, about jogging, what it is good for, and most importantly - how to start doing it. <br><br>  <b>Regular exercise is necessary and beneficial.</b>  The average ITshnik loses physical exertion at work, it is a fact.  He does not carry refrigerators to the 9th floor without an elevator, does not carry bags of cement at a construction site, does not run after a mammoth in the hope of a delicious dinner.  So over time, he only "squeals" and "blown away."  I think it feels everyone who is not involved in sports for any reason, whether it is a lack of time, laziness, or confusion.  If the desire nevertheless arises, then together with it the question arises - what kind of sport to choose? <br>  P.S.  Regular running can effectively lose weight. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>What is good running?</b>  Many IT pros are loners.  They are thoughtful, thoughtful, and never prone to excessive communication.  In general, "in themselves," some kind of recluse.  Fine!  Running perfectly fit them in spirit!  In the process of running, you can escape from the pressing problems, dream, listen to your favorite music, think about some plans, or just turn off the brain.  Do not think ‚Äúhow many approaches to make and with what weight‚Äù, make a serious face or try to look ‚Äúcool‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>On a note:</b> <br>  <i>- Running can be practiced at any convenient time: in the morning, in the evening or in the afternoon.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- It does not need a certain ‚Äúsection‚Äù, a fitness club, or a gym.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- You can run alone and with someone, it will not affect the result.</i>

      <b>Read more about running.</b>  Jogging is not a fast run at a speed of 7-9 kilometers per hour.  This is not a sprint, in the process you will not be very tired and think "damn why I started it", the whole process will be pleasant and unobtrusive.  However, it is a great way to keep yourself in good shape (when running, almost all the muscles of the human body work).  Running also helps refresh the brain and get distracted. <br><br>  In the distant 80s, running was extremely popular.  However, over time, its shortcomings also emerged.  He is not harmless.  Running on a hard surface (if you do not follow the technique), the runner gets a micro shake for all internal organs with each step, which can be very dangerous, and even deadly.  It turned out that in those days when one of the runners died while running (by the way, the action was held under the slogan ‚ÄúRunning from a heart attack‚Äù).  Since then, this slogan has collapsed, and began to preach the right approach to this sport.  But more on that later. <br><br><h4>  <b>Preparing to run</b> </h4><br>  Choose a time when you want to run.  For example, I do not like to run in the morning.  I prefer evening runs, somewhere in the half-past nine in the evening, when it was already dark.  Benefits?  Night city looks completely different, more beautiful.  Fewer passers-by.  As well as a great way to refresh the mind, so that after jogging again to do some things.  After an evening jog and a cold shower - you are full of strength again!  You can go for a run and at midnight.  I did it regularly when I didn't have to get up early in the morning. <br><br>  You will also need minimal equipment.  Sneakers, T-shirt, shorts.  Optional headband to hold hair.  All this is better to buy in a regular sporting goods store.  Pay special attention to sneakers - these should not be fashion models, but running ones.  The good thick sole well springing around a heel.  Do not pay attention to the design and manufacturer. <br>  T-shirt and shorts can be taken ordinary, but it is better if from the thermomaterials that sweat.  Be sure to make sure everything sits on you well, even if in life you prefer wide clothing.  While running, she will just hang out on you and interfere.  Again, do not pay attention to the design, you need it for the sport, and not for any show off. <br><br>  Get directions.  Take a map, paper or yandex maps, and using a ruler on the selected route, count the distance.  If you are a beginner - start from 3 km (consider the way there and back), the average distance for a spherical runner in a vacuum is 6-8 km.  Laying the route, avoid the hills, and obstacles - this is part of the preparation for the marathon distances, so if you do not plan to marathon (10 - 20 kilometers and above) - this is for you to nothing.  Avoid running ‚Äúaround something‚Äù, for example, around a stadium, you will get tired of this quickly.  Where more pleasant to run around the city.  Previously, you simply did not pay attention, but you will be <u>amazed</u> at how many other people run with you.  And regardless of the time (of course, if it is not deep at night). <br><br>  Prepare a player, playlist, if you plan to listen to music in the process.  Regardless of preference, I recommend calm music.  I also recommend including shuffle (random). <br>  Take care of the headphones.  They should sit tight on the head and not fly.  Closed headphones and a soft rag embrasure better not to use, they will collect the sweat.  Good fit usual "plugs". <br><br><h4>  <b>Immediately before running</b> </h4><br>  Do not eat before running for at least 2 hours.  If you run in the morning - do not eat breakfast, if in the evening - do not eat dinner.  Just do not drink water, even if you want. <br>  Lace your sneakers well.  Hard.  it is necessary that they become an extension of your legs.  Because  running very much wears the musculoskeletal system, shoes - the most important thing in running. <br>  Do the workout.  Like at school in gym class.  Knead everything up to the neck.  Running makes work almost all the muscles of the human body, so do not be surprised if the next day you will have nagging shoulders. <br><br><h4>  <b>In the process of running</b> </h4><br>  Look at your feet.  It is very easy to stumble on a hummock and fall down from unaccustomed to it.  Especially if you run in the dark.  After a while, you will become accustomed to automatically noticing obstacles (possible causes of a fall), and you will be able to examine the surroundings. <br>  Remember that it is necessary to run very smoothly, in soft small steps, stepping on the heels.  This may seem strange to some, but in fact, just think about it - when you run "at speed," a sprint for example, you step on socks, which should be elastic - because you are repelled by them.  And here we are pursuing other goals - to safely ‚Äúload‚Äù our body, speed and distance are not important. <br>  Also, control your breathing - if you start choking, then you are running too fast.  Perfect jogging - when you can run and chat with your companion at the same time.  Of course, this will require some practice ... <br>  Also, control your hands.  Some novices in the process of running start to swing them very much (as if it helps them to run), in fact it only takes away their strength.  Best of all, press the bent elbows against the body, and the hands (squeeze the keys / player / whatever in them) in front of you. <br>  The most important thing.  Enjoy.  Think about the meaning of life, the laws of the universe, the essence of being.  Listen to your favorite music, consider the surroundings (I hope you have beautiful ones). <br>  Middle run should last 40 minutes or more.  If you are a beginner, then 10-15 minutes less (it is believed that the fat begins to burn 40 minutes after the start of the load). <br><br><h4>  <b>After</b> </h4><br>  Very effective immediately after the run rock press.  After all, the abdominal muscles just got a good preparatory load. <br>  Optionally, you can still do squats or pushups.  Then - immediately in the shower.  Take a little life hacking: take your sportswear with you to the shower, and while you wash yourself, rinse thoroughly.  She's not dirty, you do not need a thorough wash, you just need to wash the sweat soaked in it (as long as it is fresh and it is easy).  Then hang dried.  For the next run, you will be waited for by a relatively fresh form (at least, not smelling bad). <br>  Shower, by the way, while the body is hot, it is better to take a cool one.  It is much nicer and more useful than a very hot shower (which already comes with steam). <br>  Drinking water as not to yourself immediately should not be either, it is better to wait a bit. <br>  By the way, after jogging, you will have no desire to eat from the belly.  A great way to regulate diet.  But this is a topic for a separate article on healthy eating. <br>  That's all.  Very soon after the start of your jogging, you will be drawn into and begin to enjoy every run.  It is very simple - you just have to start. <br><br>  I emphasize that you can run right up to the temperature of -10 degrees Celsius (even if you are not a walrus).  If the topic is interesting - I can write about the features of running in the winter separately. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/70814/">https://habr.com/ru/post/70814/</a></p>
