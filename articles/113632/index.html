And so, on the advice of a friend, I went to the Biglion website in search of the cherished discount in my gym.  The offer was very tempting, because instead of 1000 rubles, they offered to pay 100 and get the same number of visits as in a regular subscription.  The limitation of the promotion was that one person can buy only one coupon for himself, that is, you can buy as many as you like, but you can use one for yourself and send the rest to your friends.  The decision was not long in coming, and I purchased one coupon myself.  The next day I needed to buy a new one, so the stock seemed to be in time. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For clarity, I post the discount conditions: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/508aae74/be2549c4/8676fee9/e96b6d4c.jpg" alt="image">

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"

        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The next day, in the simulator, I found out a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù nuance, which nullified all my joy from the purchased coupon for a discount.  Namely, the fact that the purchased subscriptions for this promotion acted only in the morning time - until one o'clock in the afternoon, which did not suit me at all.  This information was missing in the information about the action.  And as the hall‚Äôs management assured me, they told the site administrations to indicate this information, but either the administration, guided by the book ‚ÄúWorking with Customers for Dummies,‚Äù did not want to post such unimportant information on the site, or the hall director simply decided to blame them, but the fact remains that I remained extreme.  Once the administration of the hall puts the blame on the site, I decided to try to talk with their support. <br>  The first letter was: <br><br>  ‚ÄúI got this coupon: <br>  <a href="http://www.biglion.ru/togliatti/deals/rflam-90/">www.biglion.ru/togliatti/deals/rflam-90</a> <br><br>  Upon arrival at the gym, it turned out that you can only walk until one o'clock in the afternoon.  This is critical information, which for some reason is not specified.  I demand to return 100 rubles 80 kopecks, which were spent on the purchase of this coupon (including WebMoney commission).  Tell me how I can return the funds. ‚Äù <br><br>  Maybe I immediately went on the attack, but there was no particular desire to deal with all this and I simply wanted to return the money (albeit small ones) for the service not provided. <br><br>  In addition, in the comments to this service, a question was asked and an answer was given to it: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/fafd844e/d9abfda0/81c374f2/31b44801.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We see that the administration itself is responsible for the time of the work of the coupon. <br><br>  Two days later, I received a somewhat unintelligible answer to my question: <br><br>  "Hello, <br>  According to the representative, everything is in force, February, March in the evening on weekdays everything is already taken, at this time free from April until the end of the coupon, the weekend is in full possession. ‚Äù <br><br>  It feels like they put a person in the support who understands little in speech literacy.  I will also clarify that the restriction on the number of people in the hall has never been and has not appeared so far, and what kind of such ‚Äúbusy‚Äù and ‚Äúfree‚Äù speech is, only a philosopher can guess. <br><br>  Then I sent a more angry letter with the desire to achieve my goal: <br><br>  ‚ÄúI have been going to this hall for two years and everything is not there.  When communicating with the administration, they made it clear to me that your coupon is valid only until 13:00.  In the evening, he does not act and never acted, and you write to me here that everything is taken.  And the weekend - they are for the weekend and to relax!  Especially in the coupon and on the website it says ‚ÄúThe coupon is valid any day at any time.‚Äù, Which is not true.  I consider your actions illegal.  I would just like to return the money for the coupon, the information about which was false. ‚Äù <br><br>  Three more days passed, and the answer from the technical support did not follow - they are apparently very busy, whatever, but not the solution to the problems of their clients.  Even now I don‚Äôt know what to do and to whom to make a complaint.  Either my hall, in which I have been going for two years and have no desire to change it, or the site, which is more reasonable, since it is because of them I did not receive full information about the service.  And to be more precise, Biglion posted incorrect information, because the item ‚ÄúCoupon is valid any day at any time by appointment‚Äù clearly makes it clear that the visit time is not limited to one o'clock. <br><br>  And would you like to use the services of this company after such an event ?! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113632/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113632/</a></p>
