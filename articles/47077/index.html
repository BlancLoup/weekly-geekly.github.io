It is a pity, the authors sometimes allow themselves slightly holivarny statements, leading, respectively, to slightly holivarny responses (mine including, alas!). <br><br>  However, to write in comments that MS Word is also not stupid and allows you to quite successfully cope with writing serious (and non-trivially formatted) texts - this is one thing, but to explain what was said with specific examples is quite another. <br><br>  I think no one has any doubt that without fine file processing, using Word can be extremely unpleasant.  At the same time, not all have enough strength, time and skills to ‚Äúgrind‚Äù.

      In my daily work I use a template that I want to offer to your attention.  Work on it is carried out with long breaks, so its status can be called "permanent beta."  However, this is better than nothing, and you can still wait until I make the final release. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, the template (links below are mirrors): <br>  <a href="http://rapidshare.com/files/173892774/Universal.dotm.html">Rapida</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.onlinedisk.ru/file/51304/">Onlinedisk</a> <br><br>  This is a version for Word 2007, but I have an older version for Office 2003. <br>  How to use it.  By running the template file, you immediately go into the edit mode of the new document (based on the template). <br><br>  The first step is to enable macros (you can later add the template to the trusted list, and the message will no longer appear). <br><br>  Then you need to make an "installation" (Alt + F8, then run the Install macro).  This operation creates some object names in Word.  You can remove the names using the Uninstall macro.  The installation, of course, is done only once. <br><br>  After launching the template, you will see a new Universal panel: <br><img src="http://i055.radikal.ru/0812/90/a5ac7340cb0d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Buttons 1-5</b> set the appropriate style for the title.  At the same time autonumbering works: <br><img src="http://s49.radikal.ru/i126/0812/0a/fa5bb9c6695c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>The buttons of the next group</b> (‚ÄúLists‚Äù) are designed to work with numbered and bulleted lists.  The four top buttons create a list (of the appropriate type) of the first or second level.  Accordingly, there is no need to rely more on the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù choice of the current list level by the Word - just press the corresponding button.  The bottom button resets the current numbered list count: <br><img src="http://s48.radikal.ru/i121/0812/6e/aeb04b1ce407.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>The third group</b> allows you to insert any object into the text.  I work mainly with drawings, tables and listings.  Moreover, each type of object has its own numbering (I think this is the most typical scenario in most cases): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/964/551/630/96455163075c0b78faae0bdcaab78217.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I have not yet made a competent switch between the Russian and English versions of the text.  While each figure displays the heading "Fig.", The table "Table", and the listing - "Listing".  However, in the body of macros it is easy to find these lines and replace them with any others.  Also, the various styles for signatures are not very relevant to me.  So far, the table column headings (tabl_header) and listing body (listing_body) have their own style. <br><br>  (Lyrical digression: this is why I am angry with MS - so much for the fact that they removed a decent listbox showing the current style of the text. It‚Äôs in vain!) <br><br>  For technical reasons, I was forced to arrange each heading as a separate table (this can be seen if you turn on the display mode for non-printing characters).  It's not scary, you just need to be careful when entering the title of the object (you can mistakenly insert text where you do not need): <br><br><img src="http://s57.radikal.ru/i155/0812/33/4b6f43558d95.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Attention</i> : now it is assumed two-level numbering of objects (chapter number), therefore at least one first level heading should always be present in the text.  Yes, one more detail.  The picture is inserted as a link (not as an embedded object), but this can, of course, be changed if required. <br><br>  <b>Group Refer to Object is</b> designed to create links to objects. <br>  Each of the buttons with a pencil creates a link to the corresponding type of object (figure, listing, table).  A window opens with a full list of objects of this type, and you select the desired one: <br><img src="http://i064.radikal.ru/0812/db/45655b60f160.png" alt="image"><br>  (after insertion): <br><img src="http://s47.radikal.ru/i116/0812/12/5e2b22a8223a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Both the number of the object itself and the link are automatically recalculated fields.  Thus, you can insert a new picture between Figures 1 and 2. It will receive the number 2, and Figure 2 will automatically turn into Figure 3. Accordingly, the link to Fig.  2 will become a reference to fig.  3 <br><br>  By default, the Word does not update the links (this is a lengthy operation).  Therefore, after inserting objects somewhere in the middle, you need to call a forced update (button with an exclamation mark). <br><br>  Of course, it could be called automatically, but I decided that it would rather hurt if the document is long and the user wants to insert 5-10 objects into the middle at once. <br><br>  <b>The last group</b> includes (for the time being few) style buttons: <br>  1) style command.  I use to highlight variables: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e34/e54/ce5/e34e54ce55aa47619def27b3853993e1.png" alt="image"><br>  The button corresponds to the key combination Ctrl + Shift + C.  Those.  just select the fragment, press the key combination - and the text will become monospaced.  Pressing the button again (or Ctrl + Shift + C) returns the paragraph's original paragraph style to the fragment. <br>  2) listing_body style: <br><img src="http://s48.radikal.ru/i119/0812/3f/d442118309d3.png" alt="image"><br>  Suppose there is a code fragment in the text, but it is not large enough for an independent listing. <br>  3) The style of "normal."  Return to the standard paragraph style.  It is useful, for example, to finish entering a numbered list (pressing a button turns the next list item into ‚Äújust text‚Äù). <br>  4) Auto listing format.  Turns all tabs into four spaces, shifts the listing to the left as much as possible.  The meaning of the shift is this.  Suppose I want to insert into the text two lines from the body of the foo () function: <br><pre> void main ()
 {
     void foo ()
     {
         for (;;)
             do_something ();
     }
 }
</pre><br>  Lines (for (;;) ...) will be greatly shifted to the right, but I do not need it. <br><br>  Here, perhaps, that's all.  I also wrote a module for bibliography, but I hardly ever finish it.  EndNote handles this job more than satisfactorily.  But the current (very simple) version of my module can also be useful.  I can lay out if there are requests. <br><br>  <b>Note 1</b> : The macros are full of old unnecessary code.  All hands do not reach to remove :) <br>  <b>Note 2</b> : Many thanks to the unfamiliar author of the very first version of this template, which fell into my hands around 2003.  Now the template has become completely different, but the overall spirit (as well as some pieces of code) remained unchanged. <br><br>  <b>UPDATE:</b> Template version for Word 2003 <br>  <a href="http://rapidshare.com/files/173933084/templates03.rar.html">Rapidshare</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.onlinedisk.ru/file/51384/">Onlinedisk</a> <br>  Unfortunately, I do not have Word03 installed on my computer right now, so I can't really check what is there and how it works. <br>  I only remember that in this template there is still (seemingly) no Install macro, but it can be pulled out of the new version.  And for the old one in the archive there is a Normal.dot with an installation already done.  I also remember that there are several panels with buttons, but really only one of them is useful and corresponds to the 2007 version.  If there are problems, report. <br>  <b>UPDATE: The</b> topic is moved to "I'm smart." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/47077/">https://habr.com/ru/post/47077/</a></p>
