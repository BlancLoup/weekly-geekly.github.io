      The offer to go to China came from my girlfriend, whom I hadn‚Äôt seen for a long time since she is studying in the student city of Harbin.  She told me where to look for work in her specialty, after which she explained in general terms how to get there.  As a result, the decision came suddenly, because there was nothing to lose at home.  Further more. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Documents receiving </h5><br>  Without a couple of pieces of paper, they won't let us go anywhere from Russia.  So take a lot of time, patience and go to collect documents for a passport. <br><br>  For those who do not know, you need to apply for a passport: Fill out a passport application, a photocopy of your work, the original Russian passport + photocopies, 4 photos, for the military obliged certificate from the military office or military ID and of course the certificate of payment of duty (usually around 1000R ).  We give the documents to the FMS and wait.  While we are waiting, we can look for where to make a visa, preferably a tourist one, they want less money for it and if something goes wrong, you can always return. <br>  I did a visa at a travel agency, giving away my passport. Passport, a completed application form (given in the agency), 2pcs color photo, and money return itself.  I paid for a visa somewhere 3000r per month. <br><br>  The tourist visa has a gap of three months.  During this time, you need to have time to enter the country, and what else would be in reserve 30 days, otherwise you may have problems. <br><br>  If you can, it is better to take a visa for 3 months.  It is necessary to make a certificate that you are NOT HIV positive, it may not be necessary, but our customs is famous for its unpredictability. <br><br><h5>  Work searches </h5><br>  Of course, without any hope, a ray of light or friends, you should not try to stick to China.  For without knowing the language, you cannot do anything. <br><br>  Since my friend is studying in Harbin, I began to look for work there.  There is a whole resource dedicated to China, and everything connected with it.  Wherever I could, I left my resume.  Needless to say, no matter what level you are, it is useless to wait for what they write to you right away.  I probably waited a month or two and here they wrote me on Skype and told me that there was work at the Russian restaurant.  Yes Yes.  To work as the system administrator at restaurant.  I also accidentally gave a hint that I can work with sound and light equipment, it was a mistake, but more on that later.  Since I wanted to leave, I agreed.  And just my visa was almost ready. <br><br>  In general, it is difficult to find an IT job, but it is possible. <br><br><h5>  Trip to china </h5><br>  In China you can get in 3 ways, it all depends on your personal account in the bank. <br><br>  1. Airplane - buy a ticket, fly a few hours, go through customs and we are in heaven.  PROFIT! <br>  2. Direct (corporate) train Moscow - Beijing.  We buy a ticket, stock up on food, because we are going to go for a long time, mentally preparing to go with the Chinese.  It is in the train that you will understand all the delights of heaven.  The total time of customs clearance is about 12 hours, while half is at the Russian customs, and half at the Chinese.  We are going through the ‚Äúwonderful‚Äù city of Zabaiklsk and are dying of boredom for six hours.  Then 40 minutes on the train, Chinese customs officers screaming "papot, pashpot" and the same number in Manchuria.  Go from Krasnoyarsk to Harbin, about 4 days. <br>  3. But not every city has a direct train, and not every city planes take off.  Therefore, there is another option - shifter.  By train, get to the nearest border town.  The most popular are: Blagoveshchensk, Zabaikalsk, and some other city bordering the Chinese city of Sui-pong-he.  Please be careful, as not all customs work until late.  Match the time of arrival and the time of customs closing.  Otherwise you can get into prosak.  Crossed the border once - crossed the border two.  Now you need someone to meet you, the Chinese-speaking.  No, taxi drivers screaming: STATION-STATION !!!  Do not count.  They will rip off a goat like sidorov, kiss on their cheeks, try to rape and disappear back home ... The main rule in the border Chinese cities is: DON'T TRUST AND DON'T BELIEVE ANYONE.  All prices that you say, divide by 5, if not by 10. If you do not have a friend who can meet you - go straight to your destination. <br><br><h5>  Job </h5><br>  Arriving in China, you will be stunned, from the number of people at the station, your clothing markets that are full of Asians, will seem to you a small playground. <br><br>  Moving away from the shock, the main thing is to find our people, otherwise it will be bad. <br><br>  Actually, having arrived, I had to rest a week and get into a rhythm, at first the work seemed normal to me.  But it was not the case, the employer was a bastard.  Eternal problems with money were, the visa did something for me, and only for 3 months WITHOUT POSSIBILITY TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY (!!!), of course, we initially agreed on a salary, but everything that I was paid there was barely enough for food, since I had an apartment she did not take pictures, but lived with a friend who, in the goodness of her soul, sheltered me.  Of course, the restaurant offered me to rent an apartment, but I modestly refused.  Because it‚Äôs not a fact that this is not another item in my spending, plus the whole apartment there was worse than Savdep's hostels.  Moreover, the employer knows that I don‚Äôt really want to go anywhere, but I also could not live like this.  I worked from 9 to 9, as a Chinese, doing all they say. <br><br>  An abomination, but there was nothing to be done, and I again began to look for work, but this time was better. <br><br>  While working in a restaurant, I found many interesting people and earned various connections.  So they recommended me to one large Russian company, which is located in Beijing.  Having collected things, I moved to Beijing, the employer got a good one. After a probation period, they left me.  The employer gave me an apartment for my money and paid me a one-year multivisa, which I am very happy about. <br><br>  In Beijing, there are enormous opportunities for self-realization, especially if there are connections. <br><br><h5>  Life in china </h5><br>  It turned out not so easy.  Too complicated Chinese, and the city, I will say is not small.  So, in order to get somewhere I constantly had to call my girlfriend, since it is not enough just to say a word, you must have the correct intonation and stress, otherwise they will take you to hell for kulichiki and money to be torn off like a bush.  Over time, I settled down and even learned the way from home to work.  I started to ride buses, and by taxi I knew the shortest way. <br><br>  Food in China is also not particularly good.  At least for our European taste.  Everything is either spicy or sweet.  Therefore, we either cook ourselves or eat at McDonalds.  However, food prices have pleased.  Vegetables and fruits are just a fairy tale here!  Cheap and everything is there.  For 100 rubles you can take the darkness of vegetables for a salad, a good piece of meat and fruit for dessert.  However, you also need to know where to get it.  Virtually every home has a so-called tsai-may, which translates: quick purchase.  Here you can buy cookies and vegetables, for meat it‚Äôs better to go to a big supermarket. <br>  And yet there are not enough products such as cheese, mayonnaise, normal, and not soy milk, good sausage, ordinary bread (here it is always sweet and nasty), cottage cheese, sour cream and so on, and so on. <br><br>  You can spend time here in different ways.  A lot of cafes, restaurants.  Depending on tastes and price category.  What not to say, and special places for walking here are very beautiful.  Parks, alleys, there is where to sit and relax.  There are clubs, but I am not such a person, I do not like them. <br><br>  What is most annoying is the increased attention to the Russians, especially those who look outside the box.  Poke fingers, climb into the face and shout HALLOW!  OK!  And so on ... Photograph on the phone, they want to meet, no matter what your gender.  And unfortunately everything is very, very nasty, dirty and smelly.  Simple Chinese people are not very different love of hygiene. <br><br>  The apartment is not easy to rent.  More precisely not easy to find.  Compared with Russia, the price tag, of course, is disproportionately low.  However, here you need to lay out the amount at least six months at a time, otherwise, if you pay monthly, the figure rises by almost half. <br><br>  Life in China is not very simple, but very exciting and interesting. <br><br><h5>  useful links </h5><br>  <a href="http://polusharie.org/index.php">All about China, job search</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.fms.gov.ru/documents/passport/">Getting a passport</a> <br>  <a href="http://ru.china-embassy.org/rus/lsyw/sbqz/t128805.htm">Visa Information</a> <br><br>  PS I am pleased to answer any questions from the community. <br><br>  Internet and IT in China is a separate topic. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : I described my method of moving to another country and the possibility of living in it. <br>  <b>UPD2</b> : On special requests, I post a photo: <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/4d/4b/4d4be22ea7faa2d47f78816df3a527bc.jpg"></a> <br>  <b>UPD3</b> : Thank you very much for your interest in my topic.
