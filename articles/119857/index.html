The patient needs to monitor health and diet.  The Dia-Life.ru service is useful for self-checking.  With it you can track the consumption and consumption of calories, weight and blood sugar levels.  The site has a database of 900 major food products that are used in the calculations, and information on calorie consumption during all major human activities. <br><br>  Now the editors of the blog know that computer work burns 101 kcal per hour, and feeding large animals - 353 kcal.  The ridge of service from Yakutia - accuracy in details.  There are several similar services in the west (there is only one in Russia, but not for diabetics).  Kalininsky studied the disadvantages and merits of each of them and wants to do the best.  It will happen in a year and a half.  In the full version of the site there will be, for example, a ‚Äúdesigner of diets‚Äù and a diary of physical parameters, with the possibility of shooting yourself on camera.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/mathematics-diabetes/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/c549a363/e02e3d73/1d1e92ba/29d025da.png" align="left"><h5>  The bottomles </h5>  Ukrainian application developer, Pavel Alexandrovich, in his service The Bottles focuses on a wide audience - lonely and curious people. <br><br>  The Bottles is an anonymous messaging service with game functionality.  Now The Bottles exists as an application for the AppStore (7000 downloads).  When launching the application, the user sees floating bottles with notes, which can be opened, read, leave a comment or start a correspondence without registering. <br><br>  Among the competitors of The Bottles are Distant Shore and Messege in a bottle applications.  Pavel considers bright design and the flow of bottles, which ensures the constant appearance of new messages and undying user interest, as his main advantage.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/bottles/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/dee4104d/f6d4361b/6037a5bf/3fa5afd7.png" align="left"><h5>  I'm sync </h5>  Imagine that you have a small business: for example, you do something with your own hands or you have a cafe, club or shop.  Then you want to sell something on your website, but the online store does not make sense to convert it.  Or you will need to place on the site a restaurant menu and an event poster, but you don‚Äôt have the desire to hire a programmer to create them.  For such cases, programmers from St. Petersburg Andrei Cheptsov and Andrei Turbin came up with I'm Sync.  This service allows you to quickly integrate into the site the components you need.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F-%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/98fb54cf/3f065f54/3979fa50/cee34998.jpg" align="left"><h5>  Viptalon </h5>  Viptalon service is designed specifically for lovers of discounts and sales.  Users (and there are already about 40,000) are given the opportunity to receive a variety of discounts on purchases in stores. <br><br>  Visitors simply choose one of the offers presented on the site, pay for a discount vip card, print it out and present it at the checkout in the store. <br><br>  Discounts are available for various types of products - clothes, shoes, household goods, etc.  However, the creators of the project basically do not offer discounts on services - in their opinion, this is their main competitive advantage over the few competitors.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/products-for-vip-coupons/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a967422f/b48281b3/9da17456/cb87ffc0.png" align="left"><h5>  Yasno.Ru </h5>  As is often the case, project ideas arise when a certain need for a service or product matures.  Just like two ladies - Elena Zharikova and Elena Rubets - the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project Iasno.RU came to mind when they were desperate to interview friends and gather the necessary information from all over the Internet. <br><br>  ‚ÄúLast year I studied the popular Joomla engine.  It was a horror - I didn‚Äôt work out something, I went to the forums, sat for hours, looking for answers to questions, waited days for answers to the questions I had been given.  And she cursed, thinking that time does not wait, and I would pay, if only I could quickly get a professional and clear answer.  I don‚Äôt even mention how often I remembered the services of experts when it came to my family. ‚Äù  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/%25D1%258F%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE/">+++</a> <br><br>  <b>PS</b> If you heard about interesting projects, write to us - startup@wanted.vc - and we will write about them! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119857/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119857/</a></p>
