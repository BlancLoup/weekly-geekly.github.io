    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What is an online photo school? </h4><br>  This is a regular photo school, only better!  Imagine: you do not need to spend time traveling from home / work to school and back, you do not need to adjust your schedule to the school schedule.  It would seem that the benefits are obvious!  Nevertheless, there are almost no online photo schools in runet.  We love photography very much and we love the Internet as much, which is why in the summer of 2010 we started working on the project Fotoshkola.net. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/4301f01b/4e80df9f/236d787b/d816f414.jpg"><br><br>  The main idea, which we based on the concept of our photo school, was the freedom of the student in the matter of the choice of training time.  To our surprise, nobody used to work with such a scheme before.  What is the point in the online prefix, if a student has to wait for day X to start learning, wait for day Y to get another task, and be afraid to skip day Z, otherwise you will have to catch up in a hurry then?  The possibilities of the Internet should be used, we decided, and this is what the concept of work turned out from the user's point of view: <br><br>  - you can start learning the next moment after paying for the course; <br>  - to study (that is, to get acquainted with theoretical materials and perform practical tasks) at any convenient time; <br>  - Questions to the teacher receive a guaranteed quick response.  We guarantee a response within 24 hours, depending on the current load, the teacher can respond within a few hours (usually this happens). <br><br>  The tasks are seemingly simple, however, the active development of the project began last summer and has not yet ended.  Since all the interaction between the student and the teacher occurs in the interface of the site (no email and Skype), it was necessary to create from scratch a lot of tools that provide this interaction. <br><br><h4>  What's inside? </h4><br>  In our photo school, training takes place on courses.  What is a course?  Firstly, this is a mass of theoretical information: each course consists of 6-10 lessons.  To complete the course, the student must consistently study each lesson and complete the assignment for it.  However, if in the process of learning a student has difficulties with this or that task, he can always skip it and return to its implementation a little later. <br><br>  The lesson consists of a large article, a video (usually 10-15 minutes), which can be viewed online or downloaded to a computer or mobile device.  In addition, an extensive gallery of examples is attached to each lesson, where the author of the course shares his experience with students on the example of concrete works. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/4d01b08f/4fefdaca/f848c7fc/ad504851.jpg"><br><br>  After reviewing all this abundance of materials, the student receives a task or several tasks, is armed with a camera or computer (in the processing courses) and begins to create masterpieces.  Within one task you can download 6 works.  Each of them, the teacher considers, as we have said, within a day from the moment of submission, and either sends for revision with some comments, or immediately accepts.  Although from the student‚Äôs point of view, the first option is more interesting, of course, the first option is to learn only from your mistakes :) Without stuffing your own bumps and not making standard mistakes, you cannot rise to the next level of creativity.  The student can publish any picture sent to the assignment, then it will go to the course gallery and will be visible to other students of the course. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/85403782/62d55e46/f472092d/f67aa5db.jpg"><br><br>  In addition, students can communicate with each other: on a closed forum of the course and under photos of each other.  Given that the geography of the photo school now extends from Kamchatka to Cyprus (passing through Siberia, the USA and South America), an online photo school is also a great way to make new friends in different parts of the world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/1cce8edb/19d9aae9/88da6149/e0852f8d.jpg"><br><br>  With the concept figured out, I must say a few words about the main thing - about what you can learn.  In any school there are two main things: they are teachers and students.  The way teachers build training courses, how they communicate with students, which give advice, ultimately, and form the image of a photo school.  And in this sense, we are incredibly lucky, because all the teachers working with us, set an extremely high level of quality in everything that they do for the project.  Come to them to study - you will not regret it, really.  Here are all the courses that are in the photo school today: <br><br>  <a href="http://fotoshkola.net/courses/10-lightroom-osnovy">‚ÄúLightroom.</a>  <a href="http://fotoshkola.net/courses/10-lightroom-osnovy">Basics</a> <br>  <a href="http://fotoshkola.net/courses/3-vash-zerkalnyy-canon-osnovy-raboty-s-kameroy">‚ÄúYour mirror canon.</a>  <a href="http://fotoshkola.net/courses/3-vash-zerkalnyy-canon-osnovy-raboty-s-kameroy">Camera basics ¬ª</a> <br>  <a href="http://fotoshkola.net/courses/4-photoshop-dlya-fotografa-osnovy">‚ÄúPhotoshop for the photographer.</a>  <a href="http://fotoshkola.net/courses/4-photoshop-dlya-fotografa-osnovy">Basics</a> <br>  <a href="http://fotoshkola.net/courses/5-kompozitsiya-osnovy">"Composition.</a>  <a href="http://fotoshkola.net/courses/5-kompozitsiya-osnovy">Basics</a> <br>  <a href="http://fotoshkola.net/courses/1-uchimsya-fotografirovat-malyshey-i-malyshek">"Learning to photograph babies and babies"</a> <br>  <a href="http://fotoshkola.net/courses/6-portret-osnovy">"Portrait.</a>  <a href="http://fotoshkola.net/courses/6-portret-osnovy">Basics</a> <br>  <a href="http://fotoshkola.net/courses/8-tsifrovoy-fotoapparat-osnovy-raboty">"Digital camera.</a>  <a href="http://fotoshkola.net/courses/8-tsifrovoy-fotoapparat-osnovy-raboty">Work Basics</a> <br><br>  Anyone who has read this far is a gift: a 15% discount if you decide to study with us.  The code word for payment is habr. <br><br>  We can definitely say that the project is just beginning now, and there is still a lot of interesting things for both users and us, the creators and developers of the photo school. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114869/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114869/</a></p>
