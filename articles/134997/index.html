In my opinion, no.  The scales are not the same.  :) <br><br>  I don‚Äôt remember exactly where I heard, but I remember that one of the Coca-Cola development directors once said: ‚ÄúDo you think our competitor is Pepsi?  By no means.  Our main and most important competitor is simple water.  It is not profitable for us to win back the percentage of Pepsi fans who are insignificant compared to the percentage of people consuming water. ‚Äù <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  And I'm looking at <a href="http://itrack.ru/research/cmsrate/">http://itrack.ru/research/cmsrate/</a> , trying to evaluate the CMS market and think about the numbers.

      <i>Q3 2011</i> <i><br></i>  <i>A total of 3,433,511 domains were surveyed.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The proportion of domains that responded within 20 seconds was 56.28%.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>CMS detected on 14.61% of domains.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The share of paid circulation CMS is approximately 12.91% of the total share of detected CMS for the RU zone</i> <br><br>  That is, 3.5 million domains, 56% of them answered - these are 2 million sites.  CMS detected by 14.6% - these are almost 300.000 sites.  And of these, 13% are paid commercial CMS, the rest are free ... And this is 39.000 against 260.000!  The pieces of the pie are decently different! <br><br>  If you take the leaders of non-commercial CMS: Joomla and WordPress, this is 61% of 260 thousand, i.e.  almost 160.000 sites. <br>  In commercial CMS, the leader Bitrix - 56% - in percentage is almost the same, but in figures it is only about 22.000 sites ... <br>  Even if we don‚Äôt manage to entice in monstrous efforts, say, 30% of users from Bitrix to diafan.CMS, forcing them to spit on previously paid money and implementation efforts, it will be only 7.000 licenses ... I think it‚Äôs much more interesting to entice people from Joomla , or from the same WordPress.  If you lure only 10% of users, it will be 16.000 licenses.  :) <br><br>  Moreover, the network I met dissatisfied reviews about Jumla, especially from novice webmasters.  Judging by them, people need concise modules, concise management, no need to hang on the site all sorts of cumbersome plug-ins, so that the necessary functions appear, like a CNC.  The eternal problem of Joomla with duplicate pages and sessions in addresses, which negatively affects indexing.  Often, people need answers to questions about how to change this or that in the structure of the site ... <br>  I didn‚Äôt see any particular complaints about WP, as long as it is a small informational site.  But when it is necessary to add an online store, exclamations start to come across, they say, the functionality is a little bit poor and don‚Äôt understand how to fix it.  Of course, I'm not talking about blogs and home pages, but about those cases when a website of a commercial organization is created on a free CMS. <br><br>  What keeps people having a website on WordPress from moving to another CMS?  Of course, and mainly its indexation by search engines and, as a result, the attendance of an existing project.  And probably, if the site owner is asked to keep the URLs and content, but it is very inexpensive to replace the CMS with a more convenient one, which has a store and a lot more, as well as indefinite technical support for the load, should people not mind?  :) <br><br>  In general, we began to move in this direction.  We have created an <a href="http://user.diafan.ru/forum/show371/">automatic converter</a> that extracts information from WP and imports it into diafan.CMS.  That is, users whose site has grown from WordPress, can move to diafan.CMS with minimal effort. <br><br>  Further according to the plan converter Joomla-&gt; diafan.CMS, DLE-&gt; diafan.CMS. <br><br>  Do you think the idea is worthwhile?  Maybe people still have some discounts to promise for moving from another CMS? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134997/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134997/</a></p>
