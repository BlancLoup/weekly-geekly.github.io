For example, I stopped communicating with <b>TC</b> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  Picture </h1><br>  <b>CAMRip (CAM, screen, rag)</b> <br>  Sometimes mistakenly labeled as Screen (SCR).  Video and sound are recorded on camera in the cinema hall.  The image can sometimes be taken at an angle to the screen, tremble, in some films you can see the heads of other moviegoers, etc.  The sound quality is different, there may be noise such as public laughter.  Usually the worst and the very first quality that can be found after the official release of the film.

      <b>Telesync (TS)</b> <br>  Ideally, it is recorded from the screen by a professional (digital) camera mounted on a tripod in an empty cinema or in the operator‚Äôs cabin.  Video quality is much better than in CAMRip.  Sound is recorded directly from a projector or other individual output, such as a headphone jack in a chair.  Thus, the sound is very good and without interference, usually in stereo mode.  Many TSs are in fact CAMRips that have a name confused. <br><br>  <b>Telecine (TC, "roll")</b> <br>  The copy is removed from the film with the help of special equipment (film scanner) or recorded from a special projector with audio and video outputs.  The quality depends on the equipment used - from good to indistinguishable from DVD, the sound is excellent.  Sometimes there are problems with the naturalness of colors ("yellowness" of the picture). <br><br>  <b>Super Telesync (SuperTS, Super-TS, Digitize)</b> <br>  This TS (occasionally TS), driven through the computer - the film is clarified, aligned, removed the extraneous noise of image and sound, etc.  The quality is often not bad, but depends on the creator. <br><br>  <b>DVD-Rip (DVDRip)</b> <br>  Rip from the original DVD, often compressed to MPEG4 to reduce the size of the film.  Mainly DVDRip 650-700 MB and 1.3-1.5 GB.  The quality is very good, although it depends on the skill of the creator (‚Äúripper‚Äù).  Sometimes better quality versions are referred to as SuperDVD, HQ DVD. <br><br>  <b>DVD5 (DVD-5)</b> <br>  Copy (uncompressed) from the original DVD.  Volume - 4-4.5 GB. <br><br>  <b>DVD9 (DVD-9)</b> <br>  Copy (uncompressed) from a dual-layer original DVD.  Volume - 7-9 GB. <br><br>  <b>R5</b> <br>  DVD-Rip from a disc distributed within the CIS (and such discs come out earlier than in other countries) with an original (ie, English) sound track taken from other sources. <br>  As an option - Telecine (TC, "roll"). <br><br>  <b>DVD-Screener (DVDScr, DVDScreener) (SCR)</b> <br>  Copy of the promotional DVD (film disc, promotional version or beta).  Quality is like DVDRip, but the picture is usually ‚Äúcorrupted‚Äù with watermarks, warning labels and black and white inserts (‚Äúmissing color‚Äù). <br><br>  <b>SCREENER (SCR)</b> or <b>VHS-SCREENER (VHSScr)</b> <br>  Same as DVDScr, only from video cassette.  A copy of the "promotional" VHS (film critic cassette, advertising version or beta).  Image quality is comparable to very good VHS, but the picture is usually ‚Äúcorrupted‚Äù by watermarks, warning labels and black and white inserts (‚Äúmissing color‚Äù).  The sound is not bad, usually stereo or Dolby Surround. <br><br>  <b>PDTV-Rip (PDTVRip)</b> <br>  Pure Digital Television Rip - rip from "pure" digital television.  The designation shows that when encoding there was no conversion from an analog signal to a digital one.  Under the general designation PDTV-Rip can hide SAT-Rip, DVB-RIP, IPTV-RIP.  The source can be a satellite channel (DVB-S), DVB-T unencrypted terrestrial digital broadcasting, sometimes IP-TV and other digital broadcasting channels that do not use (or successfully bypass) special methods that prevent direct recording of the digital stream.  Most often there is the channel logo. <br><br>  <b>TV-Rip (TVRip)</b> <br>  The material is recorded from a television signal, usually cable (but they come across from a simple antenna).  Almost all television series are primarily distributed in this or SATRip format.  Quality depends on hardware, software, and rip skills. <br><br>  <b>Transport stream</b> <br>  An unprocessed (raw) audio-video stream, taken directly from digital television. <br><br>  <b>SAT-Rip (SATRip)</b> <br>  Similar to TVRip.  The material is recorded from satellite video (as a rule, this is digital MPEG2 video).  The quality depends on the provider, the channel and the quality of the rip.  Usually such a rip is only slightly inferior to DVDRip (although there are exceptions).  Most often there is the channel logo. <br><br>  <b>DSRip</b> <br>  Same as SAT-Rip (SATRip). <br><br>  <b>IPTV-Rip (IPTVRip)</b> <br>  Similar to SATRip.  The material is recorded from digital IP-TV (as a rule, this is digital MPEG2 or MPEG4 video).  Usually such a rip is only slightly inferior to DVDRip.  Most often there is the channel logo.  Appeared relatively recently. <br><br>  <b>WEB-DL and WEB-DL 720p</b> <br>  Rips received from broadcasts over the Internet from the iTunes Store.  The main feature is enhanced quality (along with BDRip'ami), there are no TV channel logos and there are final credits. <br><br>  <b>iTunes Digital Copy</b> <br>  Video obtained from the Apple online store using the code on the package of the licensed DVD or BD or located directly on the disk. <br><br>  <b>DVB-Rip (DVBRip, DVB-T Rip)</b> <br>  Similar to SATRip.  The material is recorded by digital terrestrial broadcasting (as a rule, this is digital MPEG2 video, occasionally MPEG4).  The quality depends on the provider, the channel and the quality of the rip.  Usually such a rip is only slightly inferior to DVDRip (although there are exceptions).  Most often there is the channel logo. <br><br>  <b>HDTV-Rip (HDTVRip)</b> <br>  Rip with HDTV movie (1920x1080, 1280x720), which is often done with a resolution of normal (non-HDTV) rip (sometimes with the original resolution).  Quality is often better than DVDRip.  Under the general name HDTV-Rip, there are rips from BD-Rip, HDDVD-Rip, digital satellite and cable operators broadcasting on HDTV.  In the description often the notation 720p, 1080p, 1080i, 1280p (see below.) <br><br>  <b>BD-Rip (BDRip, BRRip, BR-Rip)</b> <br>  Rip with a blu-ray DVD disc (from 25 GB per layer).  Refers to HDTV.  Real BDRip movies have much better quality than DVDRip.  File size - File size - from 2 to 9.5 GB.  Often, the size of the picture is also indicated immediately in the designation.  For example, BDRip.720p BDRip.1080p.  Sometimes there are rips from DVDs with a larger image and incorrect BDRip designation. <br><br>  <b>HD-DVD-Rip (HDDVDRip, HDDVD-Rip, HDDVD)</b> <br>  Rip with HD DVD disc (from 15 GB per layer).  Refers to HDTV.  In connection with actually playing HD-DVD in the war of Blu-Ray VS VS HD-DVD formats, the number of such rips will be insignificant. <br><br>  <b>HDDVD-Remux</b> <br>  Reassembled streams of the original HDDVD without menus in the container, usually TS or MKV. <br>  The video is identical to the original.  No loss in quality. <br><br>  <b>BluRay-Remux</b> <br>  Reassembled streams of the original BlyRay disc without a menu into a container, usually TS or MKV. <br>  The video is identical to the original.  No loss in quality. <br><br>  <b>Laserdisc-RIP (LDRip)</b> <br>  Similar to DVDRip.  This version is made from Laserdisc.  It is quite rare, mostly old films. <br><br>  <b>VHS-Rip (VHSRip)</b> <br>  Source material cassette VHS format, usually quite average quality. <br><br>  <b>DTheater-Rip</b> <br>  Digitization of high definition cassette.  The video quality is quite high.  There may be noise and blurred images. <br><br>  <b>AVC (Advanced Video Coding)</b> <br>  Licensed video compression standard (H.264 aka MPEG-4 Part 10), designed to achieve a high compression ratio of the video stream while maintaining high quality. <br><br>  <b>720p, 1080p, 1080i, 1280p, etc.</b>  - Designations are found in HDTV films and rips. <br>  The figure is the vertical resolution of a picture at a 16: 9 aspect ratio.  For example - 720p - 1280x720 <br>  <b>i (interlaced scan)</b> - interlaced scan, the image is formed from two half-frames (as in conventional television).  This reduces the flow (and hence the file size), but in motion you can see the so-called.  "Comb effect" on the border of colors.  Frequency 50 or 60 half frames per second <br>  <b>p (progressive scan)</b> - progressive scan, the frame is transmitted and formed as a whole, while the picture in motion is not distorted.  The disadvantage of progressive is the doubled stream compared to interlaced.  As a result - a larger file size or lower frame rate. <br><hr><br><br><h1>  Aspect ratio </h1><br>  <b>Fullscreen (FS)</b> <br>  Full screen release, 3: 4 video resolution.  Often, Fullscreen is made from the Widescreen version using the Pan and Scan (PS) method, cropping part of the frame on the sides. <br><br>  <b>Widescreen (WS)</b> <br>  One of the initial options for recording widescreen video on DVD (the other is Letterbox) - anamorphic (an image, usually 16: 9, stretched to the full 4: 3 frame - in the end, the quality is better). <br><br>  <b>Letterbox</b> <br>  One of the initial options for recording widescreen video on a DVD (the other is Widescreen (WS)) is an image, usually 16: 9, not stretched across the entire frame, but black stripes on the top and bottom are left. <br><br>  <b>Pan and Scan (PS)</b> <br>  A method of converting widescreen (WS) video to fullscreen fullscreen (FS) mode.  This cuts off part of the frame to the right and left. <br><br>  <b>WATERMARKED</b> <br>  Small logos of TV-channel or relizer. <br><hr><br><br><h1>  Movie features </h1><br>  <b>Director's Cut (DC)</b> <br>  The director's version is a special edition of the film, representing the film from the point of view of the director, and not edited according to the requirements of customers, distributors, studios, film critics, etc. <br><br>  <b>Workprint (WP)</b> <br>  This is the so-called "beta version" of the film.  Particularly interesting for movie lovers.  Usually comes out in the VCD format much earlier before the show starts in cinemas of the world.  Due to the fact that this is a preliminary version of the film, the quality of the material can be both excellent and very low.  Often there may be some scenes, computer special effects.  However, there can also be scenes in Workprint that will be cut out in the final version.  You can find out such versions by timer at the top or bottom of the screen (it is needed for the subsequent installation of the final version). <br><br>  <b>LIMITED</b> <br>  The film was shown to a limited number of cinemas.  Usually no more than 250-500. <br><br>  <b>Special Edition (SE)</b> <br>  Special version of the film.  A striking example is the renovated version of Star Wars, with the addition of computer graphics, animation, and 3D models to the 70s material. <br><br>  <b>Straight To Video (STV)</b> <br>  The film immediately came out on a DVD / cassette bypassing movie theaters.  Quality - respectively DVDrip or VHSrip. <br><hr><br><br><h1>  Release Features </h1><br>  <b>DUPE</b> <br>  The second release of the same film by another release group (usually stolen from the first) <br><br>  <b>PROPER</b> <br>  Re-release of the film (sometimes by another group) due to the poor quality of the previous one. <br><br>  <b>RECODE</b> <br>  Release converted to another format or re-encoded <br><br>  <b>RERIP</b> <br>  New rip movie <br><hr><br><br><h1>  Sound </h1><br>  <b>Dubbed</b> <br>  The original sound is removed from the film.  For example, they took a track from a Russian cinema and put it on an American release. <br><br>  <b>Mic.Dubbed</b> <br>  The same as Dubbed, only the sound was recorded by the microphone in the cinema. <br><br>  <b>Line.Dubbed</b> <br>  The same as Dubbed, only in this case the sound was taken from the ‚Äúchair‚Äù or ‚Äúprojector‚Äù (Line). <br><br>  <b>D</b> - dubbed (dubbing) <br>  <b>L1</b> - amateur monophonic translation <br>  <b>L2</b> - amateur two-voice translation <br>  <b>L</b> - amateur multi-voiced translation <br>  <b>O</b> - original (in Russian films) <br>  <b>P1</b> - professional monophonic translation (often author's) <br>  <b>P2</b> - professional two-voice translation <br>  <b>P</b> - professional multi vocal translation <br><br>  It is worth noting that the letter P in the title of the film can also signify a professional two-voice translation, as well as L - an amateur two-voice, since many release groups do not divide the translation into multi-voice and two-voice. <br><br><h4>  Alternative option </h4><br>  <b>AVO - (Author Voice Over)</b> - Author <br>  <b>SVO (1VO) - (Single Voice Over)</b> - Odnogolosy <br>  <b>DVO (2VO) - (Double Voice Over)</b> - Two- <b>voice</b> (or ‚Äúboy-girl‚Äù) <br>  <b>MVO - (Multi Voice Over)</b> - <b>Multi</b> -voiced (three or more) <br>  <b>DUB - (Dublicated)</b> - Dubbing <br>  <b>SUB - (Subtitle)</b> - Subtitles <br><br>  <b>Dubbed Translation (Dubbing)</b> is when the actors in the film speak a language that you understand, and when the original language is completely inaudible, while all other sounds should be preserved and lipsing should be maintained (lipsync).  the viewer should have the impression that the actor speaks his own language. <br>  Full movie dubbing is a technically difficult process and is considered ‚Äúaerobatics‚Äù in the film's voice acting.  It is carried out by professionals at film studios.  In order to duplicate a movie, all recorded sounds and voices must be disconnected in order to replace the voices, then reduce the overall sound. <br><br>  <b>A polyphonic voice-over translation (maybe professional or amateur)</b> is when the original speech of the film is muffled (some other sounds are muffled at the same time) and the voices of several actors (professional) or non-actors (amateur) are superimposed, but the original soundtrack is still a little audible. <br><br>  <b>Two-voice voiceover</b> - voice-over translation, but unlike the polyphony - the film translates two doubles, a man and a woman. <br><br>  <b>A single voice voiceover</b> is a translation in which all actors are voiced by the same understudy (usually a man).  Such translations are especially familiar to all movie lovers on videotapes of the 80s and 90s.  <a href="">Samples of votes translators.</a> <br><br>  <b>Simultaneous translation</b> is the translation of a speaker‚Äôs speech with a lag of 2-3 seconds, <br>  From monophonic translations distinguished himself - Dmitry Puchkov aka Goblin.  At the same time, two directions of the ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs spark‚Äù and ‚ÄúFull Peh‚Äù translations are distinguished.  The translation is offscreen, in one voice (the voice of the Goblin, respectively). <br><br>  <b>Studio "Full Pe"</b> - the correct translations Goblin.  Differ in adequacy and maximum compliance with the original text of the film.  Foul language, if any, is the place to be in the original, translated as foul language.  If there is no battle in the original, then there is no battle in the translation. <br><br>  <b>Studio "God's spark"</b> - funny translations Goblin.  Parodies of domestic film translations performed by Goblin.  In the best traditions of homegrown "translators", whose voices are heard behind the scenes, Goblin carries complete nonsense, radically changing the dialogues and plot of the film. <br><hr><br><br><h1>  Subtitles </h1><br>  <b>Subbed</b> <br>  Movie with subtitles. <br><br>  <b>Hardsub</b> <br>  Subtitles are embedded in the video stream. <br><br>  <b>Softsub</b> <br>  Subtitles are separate file / stream, and rendered by the player. <br><hr><br><br>  PS Corrections / additions / clarifications / etc. / etc.  are welcome. <br><br>  Thanks to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/0nly0ne/" class="user_link">0nly0ne</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/lashtal/" class="user_link">lashtal</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/antonwork/" class="user_link">antonwork</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/z0rc/" class="user_link">z0rc</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/gnusmas/" class="user_link">gnusmas</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/andoriyu/" class="user_link">andoriyu</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/vsviridov/" class="user_link">vsviridov</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/d1mm/" class="user_link">d1Mm</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/dmzkrsk/" class="user_link">dmzkrsk</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/vetal_l/" class="user_link">vetal_l</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/shark/" class="user_link">Shark</a> for additions and clarifications. <br><br>  Some of the information is taken from <a href="http://skachay.org.ua/">skachay.org.ua</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/80721/">https://habr.com/ru/post/80721/</a></p>
