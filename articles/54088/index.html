But no matter how this ratio is, today I‚Äôll tell you about the console, which is wrapped in a package ... well, at least indecent :) <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/0cut2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Caution!</b>  <b>Inside 54 large images totaling 6mb!</b>  <b>This is a review!</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Do not hit the quick?  Maybe then just remember those glorious times when TV channels could be counted on the fingers of one hand, and switching them was not a task for the lazy?  My brother and I often had to watch boring programs only because it was lazy to get up to the buttons of the TV.  Later, a mop was adapted for this :)

    <img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Or maybe you are familiar with the situation from the harsh reality, when it is easier to find the scandalous Higgs boson without a collider in the apartment than the right remote control at the right time?  At this time around there is any other remote, but the necessary is in the folds of blankets, covered, behind and under the sofa, under newspapers and magazines or anywhere else. <br>  Well, that's nice - you are not alone :) And now imagine that the question of buying batteries in the remotes is no longer worth asking.  As the question of finding the right remote for some device.  I was able to visualize this only with the <b>Harmony One</b> remote control <b>unit</b> from the leader in peripheral manufacturing, <b>Logitech</b> , which will be discussed today. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/14.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So, today, on my well-regarded table, the <b>Logitech Universal HarmonyOne</b> Universal <b>Console</b> .  Let the unit in the name of the model not bother you - it is rumored that once Harmony was a separate brand for the production of universal remote controls (RC), which the Swiss giant later bought.  Now this is evidenced by the redirect to <a href="http://www.logitech.ru/">www.logitech.ru</a> from the site www.harmonyremote.com, but this does not change the situation of current affairs.  With its rich features, Logitech has added Harmony consoles to their feet, so universal consoles are. <br><br><h3>  Equipment </h3><br>  Inside the box were: <br><br>  - Logitech HarmonyOne Remote; <br>  - Charger and lithium-ion battery; <br>  - AC adapter; <br>  - USB cable (USB type A - USB type B); <br>  - CD with software; <br>  - Cloth to wipe the remote; <br>  - Documentation. <br><br>  C documentation is okay - I have Russian, I‚Äôll read it when something doesn‚Äôt work :) I didn‚Äôt insert a disc with the software - it‚Äôs already possible to argue with someone for something that there will be more recent drivers on the Internet than attached to the device drives. <br>  I had to download nothing more than 54 MB.  But the review of software, as usual, is closer to the end of the article. <br><br>  I connect the adapter to the charger, insert the plug into the outlet.  Charging itself is made of black matte plastic, but the place for the remote is made of gloss. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/31.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/41.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/51.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A well-thought-out design of the ‚Äúbottom‚Äù of charging ‚Äî a small recess where the connector for the power supply ‚Äúdad‚Äù was struck;  Two grooves for the wire come from this groove - thus, the wire can be fixed both in front and behind.  4 rubber inserts in the corners of the charging bottom securely hold the device on smooth surfaces.  Conveniently. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/61.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/71.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The console is very comfortable in the hand - the relief lower part of the console and the rubberized coating contribute to the comfortable grip. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/81.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The bottom relief consists of two arcuate depressions - one serves for the grip, in which the work goes with the touch screen, the second - for working with the usual buttons. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/91.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The console itself is glossy, fairly branded.  On the back of the console, in its upper part, there are two copper contacts that are embedded in a plastic cap, behind which the infrared port is hidden. <br>  In the lower part there is a second IR port for learning the console with other consoles. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/111.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/121.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/131.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/141.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the front panel at the top is a button off the remote.  Under it is a color touch 2-inch TFT-screen, and already below it - 39 buttons, divided into 4 blocks.  The lowest digital one is responsible for channel switching.  Above it is a block with player control buttons.  Next comes a block with a cross-shaped navigation element, in the center of which is a selection confirmation button, and on the sides - buttons for volume control and channel switching.  The topmost buttons are responsible for the most frequently used functions. <br><br>  The weight of the device is about 150 grams. <br><br><h3>  Turn on! </h3><br>  It's time to turn on the device.  I open the battery compartment - it is located at the bottom of the console and opens only with a sufficiently large force (there is also a second infrared port for training).  I wonder if there are such batteries on sale?  I would not want to buy a new remote after 2-3 years :) Okay, I insert a battery (950 mA).  Chick. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/141.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The console turns on, a colorful screen saver flashes on the screen.  Next is the process of setting the time, date. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/161.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/171.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/181.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The buttons are illuminated in the dark with white illumination of medium, sufficient, brightness.  The buttons themselves are also made to the conscience - they do not swallow, they are pressed from a small effort. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/191.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I accidentally noticed the following feature - as soon as the console rests on a horizontal surface, the tilt sensor (or acceleration?) Turns it off.  But it is necessary to take it in hand, as the device immediately wakes up. <br><br>  Miraculously, he did not step on a child‚Äôs rake - he guessed that a miracle would not happen right away.  However, to be sure, I clicked the buttons, aiming at a different technique :) <br>  So, having pushed the buttons on the ‚Äúvegetable‚Äù, I lay it aside and read the instructions.  I don‚Äôt know, I guess it can be considered a minus - the device will not work unless it is first configured.  And this can be done ONLY through a computer that must be connected to the Internet.  On the other hand, this is logical ... because the console supports more than <b>225,000</b> different devices from more than <b>5,000</b> manufacturers !!!  And where to store information on all consoles, if not on the Internet? <br><br><h3>  Software </h3><br>  I install the software.  54 megabytes - usually I was always surprised - that you can shove that weight?  For example, the drivers for the scanner weigh twice as much, but there is absolutely nothing ‚Äúheavy‚Äù inside!  Similarly with some other devices.  But in the case of HarmonyOne, I did not ask myself this question ... <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/soft1.png" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/soft2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I launch the program, it immediately offers to create a user.  As I understand it, the console supports multiple users (each can have their own devices, settings, etc.), and each account can be password protected.  To some extent, these are useful functions ‚Äî for example, a special profile could be made for children so that some functions are not available for them.  On the other hand, is this function relevant if it is almost always possible to approach a controlled device and press the necessary button on it?  ;) Okay, not the point. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/soft3.png" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/soft4.png" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/soft5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Having created a profile, the program hints that it would be necessary to connect the remote control to a computer using a USB cable.  Done <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/soft6.png" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/soft7.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Next, the program offers to determine the list of devices that the console will manage.  By the way, at the same time the device supports no more than 15 devices, but for most users this will be enough. <br><br><h3>  Casting </h3><br>  Having looked around the room, I find a couple of devices, along the way having searched the consoles for them.  So, the attempt at writing was on: <br>  - HIPER HMC-2K53A-H2 Media Center ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/51228/">review</a> ), which I recently reviewed; <br>  - Philips DVP-3010 DVD player; <br>  - An old JVC TV, the model of which MAYBE have been on the back wall; <br>  - External sound card Creative X-Fi Surround; <br>  - Acoustics Microlab H300; <br>  - Acoustics Microlab H500; <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/soft8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In the program window, devices are added as follows: the device category is selected, then the manufacturer.  After this, the program asks to enter the exact name of the model and if it is in the database, the device is successfully added.  If the name is not written exactly - the program will offer options. <br>  I began to doubt the support of my media center - I chose Hiper, after which the program issued: ‚Äú <i>Enter the model name, for example, HMC-2K53A-H2</i> ‚Äù - that‚Äôs it!  :) With the media center figured out.  As with a dvd-player, speakers and sound card.  The problem arose only with the TV, whose models (and documentation) I could not find, but I didn‚Äôt want to push it - the antenna keeps on a word of honor.  I decide to try the search for "that, not knowing what." <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/soft9.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Having a TV remote at hand, I respond positively to the question of the program ‚ÄúDo you have a TV remote control?‚Äù  At the next stage, I encountered a paragraph of cracks (they didn‚Äôt appear again), after looking at them a little, I understood what they wanted from me.  I put the remote from the TV 15 inches below the bottom of the HarmonyOne and press the buttons that are asked to press.  After a few taps, the program tried to guess the model of my TV (or remote?). <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/soft10.png" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/soft11.png" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/soft12.png" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/soft13.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Like something guessed.  At the next stage, the wizard clearly showed what devices I have: <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/soft14.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And I finally felt that I was approaching the final stage of the settings.  Now you should choose several sets of actions that I can do with the help of devices.  They are called " <b>Activities</b> ."  I specify: <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/soft15.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Activity settings (you need to specify in which order and with what devices what the console should do).  Suppose I want to watch a new disc - press ‚ÄúWatch DVD‚Äù - the remote automatically turns on the TV in AV, turns on the DVD player and speakers from the TV (Microlab).  I am surprised at how much flexibility is inherent in this process - any tasks, settings, delays and other sequences! <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/soft16.png" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/soft17.png" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/soft18.png" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/soft19.png" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/soft20.png" alt="image"><br><br>  To be honest, I was already tired, but ... something tells me that I will be pleasantly surprised.  Otherwise, why such meticulousness?  And there is no such thing that everything immediately works as you want.  It's hard to learn - it's easy in battle. <br><br>  The settings program sends data via wire to the remote ... <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/soft21.png" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/soft22.png" alt="image"><br><br>  ... then goes to the main menu.  Now it looks like this: <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/soft23.png" alt="image"><br><br>  All the settings of my profile are at a glance - all the ‚Äúactivities‚Äù and devices, the parameters of which can be viewed and changed separately. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/soft24.png" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/soft25.png" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/soft26.png" alt="image"><br><br>  All really done. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/soft27.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  My first time </h3><br>  Taking the remote in my hands, I press "Activities" - I see the processes that I created. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/201.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I‚Äôm shouting "Watching the video" and ... believe it  :) Everything worked!  TV, DVD with my ‚ÄúNo disc‚Äù - of course, I was not ready for this! <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/21.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I insert the disc and on the touchscreen I select the DVD device.  The functions characteristic of the player appear on the screen, with 6 functions per page.  Everything is working!  Just can not believe it! <br><br>  I switch to the TV - it also works.  Moreover, pressing the buttons of the digital unit switches the channels instantly, although the native remote does it with a delay of 2-3 seconds. <br><br>  The sound card also responded with its blue LED and volume control appearing on the monitor screen.  Acoustic control units also dutifully respond to the console. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/22.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The only thing that did not work for me was the media center.  Despite the fact that it is guaranteed to be supported - apparently, it does not have an IR receiver.  If it were the older model <b>HIPER HMC-2K53A-A3</b> , where the remote is included, everything would work. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/23.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I write and smile :) how much it was nice.  Despite the fact that the setup process is very long and tedious, everything worked after it.  It would be much worse if there were no settings.  Here we have full scope for the flight of fantasies - something that should be at the disposal of any advanced user.  Literally everything is supported - from conventional technology, such as TVs and VCRs, to air conditioners, refrigerators with the Internet, and other delights of smart houses. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/home.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It took me about a week to hone some of the settings - theirs, right, the sea!  In the near future I plan to set up all the channels that are caught, assign icons to them and upload it all to the console - so as not to remember where everything is on the faceless gray buttons, but select the right one on the touch screen. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/26.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The screen itself is quite sensitive and you instantly get used to it.  A good resolution provides a colorful and clear picture, which is rare for devices of this type.  After all, either a monochrome display is used, or a huge touchscreen, which significantly increases the cost of the device.  Immediately - the golden mean.  To the right and below of this golden mean there are two sensitive elements responsible for turning the pages of functions and so on. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/24.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Control weighing </h3><br><br>  <b><u>Minuses</u></b> <br>  - Price (due to the momentum of the dollar, now it is about 7-10 thousand rubles, and it was about 6); <br>  - All settings ONLY through a computer with the Internet; <br>  - Simple but tedious settings (although it's worth it!); <br>  - Brand surface; <br><br>  <b><u>pros</u></b> <br>  - Good equipment; <br>  - Excellent build quality, stylish appearance, excellent ergonomics; <br>  - Color touch display; <br>  - The largest database of supported devices; <br>  - Simple, but rich settings of the remote; <br>  - Programming via the Internet; <br>  - Excellent software; <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/27.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Total </h3><br>  Undoubtedly, the ideal does not exist and there is always something to strive for - so I always expect new masterpieces from Logitech.  This remote control showed itself well and met all the hopes placed on it, which I was more than surprised by.  Even the torments of the long settings of the console ... they just fade against the background of the benefits, comfort and pleasure from the work! <br>  If the problems described at the beginning of the article stand up to you, if you have a lot of equipment and the number of consoles per unit area exceeds the allowable rate - the game is probably worth the candle - look towards universality. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/25.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Read reviews of the console on other sites and make sure that I did not invent anything in the article!  :) Therefore ... I will not be afraid to once again advise the device - you will definitely appreciate the top of the power vertical over electronics!  Logitech, +1 in karma, keep it up! <br><br>  My other recent reviews: <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/53793/">Logitech MX 5500 Revolution Review</a> <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/51228/">Overview of the HIPER HMC-2K53A-H2 Media Center</a> <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/48543/">Optimus Maximus Keyboard Review</a> <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/44248/">Optimus Mini Three Keyboard Review</a> <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/54066/">QNAP QBack 35S Drive Review</a> <br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/54088/">https://habr.com/ru/post/54088/</a></p>
