  <section class="page js-page"><h1>I'm not a pirate</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Somehow on Habr√©, an article about how gamers suggested that leading publishers sign the ‚ÄúGame of the Rights Bill‚Äù sign, the essence of which boils down to the thesis: ‚ÄúStop considering gamers to be pirates!‚Äù.  I have a feeling that, in principle, the problems stated in it concern not only games, but all media content.  There are either ways to legally receive movies and music, or they are so uncomfortable that you can not take it into account (I will be glad if someone denies this). <br><br>  To write this post I was pushed by my brother's PSP, which did not want to play mp3, flooded onto its memory card. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In D-Link DSM series media players, you cannot use the functionality of DVD images (menus, audio tracks, etc.), because the device does not have a physical DVD drive.  A full-featured playback of DVD-images on a device without a DVD-drive violates the DVD-license.

      What is it pushing?  To use DVDShrink. <br><br>  From the library shared via iTunes Server you cannot copy files to iPod.  Because iTunes can not determine that the files from it belong to me.  That is, it turns out that if I copy media files into my library, then I prove iTunes that these are my files?  Absurd.  Conclusion: use iTunes Alternative. <br><br>  Activate Windows!  I don‚Äôt know how now, but four years ago, when for the fourth time I asked to send me an activation code by phone, they sent me culturally, saying that I put the OS on different computers and try to deceive Microsoft.  After that, I, who had previously honestly bought XP Pro, stopped using MS products altogether.  Windows is bundled with my computer, and nothing else is needed from them. <br><br>  Having tried to use content with DRM, I ran into constant problems of unavailability of DRM servers with authorization errors and the inability to watch videos on any of my mobile devices. <br><br>  I still can‚Äôt legally buy a movie without a DVD / BR disc.  Well, I do not need this box on the shelf, let me download it and see.  Then get bored, download and watch again.  If the price is identical to the price of the DVD, I will not be very upset.  But I don't need a CD, I need a movie. <br><br>  In general, absurd, in my opinion, decisions from publishers and not only - the mass.  And their concerns are understandable.  Convenient mechanisms are usually vulnerable to fraudsters, so over time they become very secure and not at all convenient.  (Everyone remembers Humoresque about the plant manager, hacker, canteen and salt shakers.) <br><br>  And it turns out a vicious circle.  Hypothetically, someone makes a convenient mechanism for the legal purchase of media content, there are also fraudsters who find vulnerabilities and begin to steal it.  Protection increases and increases, those who buy it legally begin to suffer.  Nearby are torrent trackers, where you can easily get the same thing, but without problems.  Once someone thinks, ‚Äúwhat the hell‚Äù and shakes a movie or album from there.  The fight against piracy begins, in which everyone suffers losses and publishers and, most importantly, consumers.  In general, nothing good. <br><br>  There are people who download music from Veborama and are proud to have found an easy way to do it.  Some even claim that developers are suckers and cannot protect their content.  This is not true.  The absolutely transparent content access mechanism allows us to provide content to the user in a huge number of ways.  And it will be very sad if we need to impose any restrictions, due to the fact that someone complains that the music can be downloaded. <br><br>  But, for some reason, it seems to me that if you still cease to consider consumers as potential pirates and invent ways to simplify the production of content, sales will not fall, but increase.  You just need to cultivate the view that stealing is not fashionable and bespontovo. <br><br>  In conclusion, I will say that I have an idea that, it seems to me, will help cut off the fraudsters from the consumer community.  I have not fully worked it out and am not sure that it will work.  But if, for example, to make a store in the image of a habrahabr with karma among customers, then it will be possible by a majority vote to decide whether a person can make purchases in it, for what amount, in what volume or something like that.  In general, I expose the idea to your court. <br><br>  Leave a couple of abstracts for discussion in the comments (if any). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/42339/">https://habr.com/ru/post/42339/</a></p>
