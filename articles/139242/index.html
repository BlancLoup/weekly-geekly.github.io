  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Added cost of living</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  How much meaning do you bring into your life? <br><br>  Probably, the programmer, like anyone else, is faced with social standards.  You are expected to follow the rules so that you are like everyone else.  And you are physically different.  As in that famous test of Alan Cooper: people entering the plane either go to the left, into the cockpit, to control the situation and study thousands of levers;  or they go to the right and want to fly easily and comfortably.  Programmers always go left. <br><br>  At the same time, few people think that conformity and adherence to social requirements without mental effort lead to the degradation of humanity.  The fact is that the social interaction between individuals of humanity remained at the level of monkeys, and for simple functions, a brain weighing 900 grams is sufficient.

      But to solve the most difficult tasks you need a more powerful brain (which by nature in most cases only appears in men).  And the solution of previously unsolvable problems, creativity is some kind of activity that requires resistance to social dogmas.  That is, we have two systems in the brain: the limbic system, derived from monkeys and requiring us to phlometry, reproduction and absorption of food;  and the neocortex, the new bark, which makes us a rational man.  And between them there is always a conflict, which in psychology is called ‚ÄúI want‚Äù and ‚Äúneed‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Why does ‚Äúdownstream‚Äù social life lead to degradation?  Yes, because society ignores more intelligent people than the average, displaces them.  There is a negative selection for mental grounds.  So says, for example, Doctor of Biological Sciences Sergey Savelyev, here is a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D8k3HxJ9iu4w">fragment from the program about the nature of stupidity</a> . <br><br>  And in the context of the above, I want to say the following.  As you know, children copy their parents best, inheriting their traits and behavior.  And social demands tell us that it is necessary to get married for so many years, have children, and so on.  And also, that it is desirable to find a place where you can not really work.  Few people today are seeking to improve their skills to the maximum.  And units, among which readers of this blog, are engaged in self-development. <br><br>  Most simply go with the flow, beget children, and then grandchildren, adding nothing new to evolution, only increasing consumption. <br><br>  And I just wanted to say that what is called ‚Äúvalue added‚Äù in the economy should be fundamental in human life.  Before giving birth to children, a person must first develop himself and achieve success.  Because his children will be guided by their parents, copying their self-esteem, habits, studying attitudes towards other people.  And agree that in the 16-18-20 years we have little brains, there is definitely no money (except your dad is Abramovich), and there is no inner peace (¬© x / f "Kung Fu Panda 2") to be found among one per thousand. <br><br>  And is it worth giving the world the life of a child who copies not the best you in the developmental stage, or, maybe, after all, to complete the leftover level, at least your career? <br><br>  I am for the added cost of living, and in Europe, judging by their late marriages, they think the same way.  In our country, children often give birth right in high school, half the time they are brought up by parents with the injuries of the collapse of the USSR, and he knows from what this will do. <br><br>  I do not argue, you can grow good children in the most terrible conditions, there are always examples.  But this approach is unscaled, IMHO. <br><br>  And this concerns not only the establishment of children (just here it is best seen).  Concerns any actions, deeds.  What is the added value, for example, in consumption?  Or in holivarah? <br><br>  But in programs that work for the benefit of other people, there is an added value.  In a business that creates jobs, allowing people to work and feed themselves and their families, and also pays taxes to the treasury, there is added value, and in the life of a businessman.  In startups that make sense, even if frivolous (like this funny, where you can congratulate a friend, or wake up), there is an added value that is projected into the lives of people.  But all these types of activities are extremely discouraged by those who, <a href="http://old.novayagazeta.ru/data/2012/021/00.html">according to Bykov</a> , "do not belong to the people", who ask not to rock the boat and all that. <br><br>  Do you create added value in your life, or just go with the flow? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139242/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139242/</a></p>
