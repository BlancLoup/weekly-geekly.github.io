  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Terminals - RDP client with connection manager and tabs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I work as a system administrator in one outsourcing company.  It just so happened that in my work I mainly use three programs.  Radmin, Secure CRT, and Terminals.  But it was not always so. <br>  Initially, I used radmin and did not know grief, but at some point I was tired of typing passwords, first for connecting, and then for login. <a name="habracut"></a>  And I started to use the built-in windows client - mstsc.  The tool is, of course, inconsequential, and does not distinguish between the connections, if one of them does not have a standard connection port, and the second does not specify it at all.  At the same time, I had very warm feelings for Secure CRT, it really hurts me when the connections are separated by tabs, and was incredibly surprised to meet a <u>free</u> RDP client with a connection manager and tabs. <br><br>  Here are the tabs: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/675/754/651/675754651253fff843f6b6cfcab8d25b.png"><br><br>  And here is the list of connections with groups: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/05f/211/67e/05f21167e91c0014f062de893fa98eb7.png">

      Then it was still version 2.0 (stable), and all the connections were stored in the xml file, which at some point bucked and all my connections were lost.  But my love knew no bounds, I climbed the application site, and he, by the way. <a href="https://terminals.codeplex.com/">So</a> I saw that the developers posted beta version 3.0 and urged people to test it.  And most importantly, it became possible to store connections in the MS SQL database.  Since my system partition is backed up using acronis, and he (according to rumors) stopped stumbling over mdf files, starting version 11 (in my opinion), I was quite happy with storing connections in the database.  This was followed by a bug reports, the expectations of new versions, and now, literally today, all those bugs that did not give me, with a clear conscience, to recommend this application, were corrected.  If all of a sudden, and I really hope so, readers will be interested in this application - I am ready to help, everything I can.  Yes, and the developers respond to mail, they are quite lively communication in the sections of the issues and discussions. <br><br>  <strong>I will describe some features that I liked:</strong> <br><ol><li>  Creating groups.  For example, the group ‚ÄúHorns Ltd.‚Äù, and in this group all the servers of this company. </li><li>  Setting the "default user" and "default password".  Both globally and for an individual group.  The function allows you to use the "default" record without entering a login and password when creating each connection. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1e3/c0c/7e6/1e3c0c7e6e7d48d530612016322a439f.png"></li><li>  Ability to copy connections.  She is now hidden in the ‚ÄúOrganize favorites‚Äù section, which is not logical enough, but it is quite workable. </li><li>  You can create login / password / domain records, and later use these bundles in the properties of the compounds. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/14a/780/e2a/14a780e2a756620e0b392b969844bab7.png"></li><li>  The ability to use master password to run the program, because the passwords are encrypted without this option. </li></ol><br><br>  Judging by the options, the program can work with Proxy, store backup connections in Amazon S3, but I don‚Äôt have a chance to check this. <br><br>  Of course, the program has shortcomings, but do not forget that 3.0 is still beta.  Yes, and I, the person rather picky, and I do not just please, but it did happen. <br><br>  In fact, this is not only an RDP client, but I am familiar with this program exclusively in RDP matters. <br><br>  PS I want to say to those who are going to try the application. <br>  The following know-how are useful: <br>  1 - I used SQL Express r2 with Management Tools <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ru-ru/download/details.aspx%3Fid%3D23650%26hash%3DABEw8GYE2dDYAimX4LbOz4206Lk27SPU%252BZ3WPKSXqE13xWz88Ozl0Hm52RC3LjQ%252BN1MmAWoUgXqhSCATqgjYzA%253D%253D">Took here</a> <br>  2 - The database is created using the script "Terminals_CreateDatabase_v3.0.sql" <a href="https://terminals.codeplex.com/downloads/get/670153">I took it here</a> <br>  3 - Starting from the version of the application "Terminals.Release.3.0.1.180", it is necessary to update the database scheme using "UpdateCredentialBase.sql" <a href="https://terminals.codeplex.com/workitem/33885">I took it here</a> <br><br>  PS I am not a developer, but just want to share a program that I really liked. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/183228/">https://habr.com/ru/post/183228/</a></p>
