In it, we will not write a lot of letters and give a bunch of complex graphs.  We just want to thank all those who liked, left a comment, and indeed just read the previous post.  We will also tell you a little about how Habrahabr made us famous. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b81/87b/675/b8187b675b5d86e700951dc262f49971.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Introduction </h2><br>  We have been thinking for a long time, is it worth writing this post?  Can the continuation be just as exciting and interesting?  Well, in general, we did not simply want to abuse the hospitality of our annoying posts on the resource.  But, at the same time, we realized that we simply cannot fail to thank all those who helped us.

    <h2>  What about advertising? </h2><br>  I will say right away: we absolutely had no idea how to advertise and promote the application, since we had no knowledge of this.  The previous post on Habr√© was written more likely not for advertising, but simply because of the desire to share the story of the game creation with people.  We were almost sure that the written post will not bring any effect. <br><br>  But we are very deeply mistaken.  We absolutely did not expect such an influx of people from Habr: after the publication of the post, something unimaginable began. <br><br>  Within half an hour after the article was accepted by the moderator, the post had already reached the main page of Habr, and during the day it came out on top, overtaking the article about Ilya Segalovich, who is deeply respected by me from Yandex. <br><br>  After that, the article was immediately picked up by about 20 news aggregator sites, which very quickly spread the material across the Internet.  The article appeared in such news giants as Yandex.Den and Flipboard, as well as on many other sites. <br><br>  After all this, we received a huge amount of various commercial offers, offers of cooperation in our private messages in VK, as well as to our mails.  Our phones were simply torn from the number of incoming messages.  It even went so far that we were offered to participate in a very large project abroad.  And now we spend almost all our free time in order to have time to respond to everyone promptly. <br><br><h2>  What's up with google play? </h2><br>  We also had a big problem with reviews - they could not be seen on the main page of the game, since most of the players left feedback even when beta testing the game.  And the reviews of the beta test on the release version of the application are not visible.  Because of this, the appearance of the page on Google Play did not attract new users, since they had the impression that the game was the most complete knowame.  And here sympathetic habravchane also did not stand aside. <br><br>  We sat and read the reviews that came from Habr every 5 minutes with approximately the following view: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/58c/7e1/535/58c7e1535310dc95263289a3295320ee.jpg"><br><br>  It should be noted that the game has increased the average rating and exceeded 4.5 stars. <br>  Because of this download, and accordingly, the performance of the game in the overall ranking of Google began to grow rapidly upwards. <br><br>  By comparison: if at the time of the publication of the game, we were at the start at 280 in the TOP of new applications and at 260 in the TOP of new games, now we are already in the first half of the hundreds in both tops. <br><br><h2>  What is the result?  Our plans for the future </h2><br>  Now we are gradually moving away from the shock that has rolled at us and are slowly beginning to understand what happened to us in general.  And, if earlier we thought maximum about creating the second game, now we have the opportunity to do something really cool, for example, to create our own business.  Perhaps now these words sound too self-confident and somehow even rickety, but we made sure by our example that everything in this world is subject to man, and everyone can achieve a lot, but only on condition that he puts to achieve its goal is enough effort.  And we believe that our next stage in life will also be crowned with success! <br><br>  We will say at once that if we succeed in creating something with our own business, then we will do it 100% in Russia, since we have grown up here.  And we are very grateful to our country, which gave us education, as well as many, many opportunities.  Well, in general, we just like it here a lot. <br><br>  And now, during the difficult economic situation in the country, it seems to us that the time has come to thank her, to do something useful in response.  We want to do something that will help Russia in such a difficult situation, perhaps even attract foreign investors to it. <br><br><h2>  Directly thanks! </h2><br>  In general, we want to sincerely thank those habravchan who responded to the previous post, because it was thanks to you that our main dream became possible. <br>  Also, we want to thank those people who advised us on the registration of the company and the preparation of a tax return. <br><br><h2>  <b>Thanks a lot!</b> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a7b/1a0/34d/a7b1a034d858dcf224288403b1e3ac46.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/339030/">https://habr.com/ru/post/339030/</a></p>
