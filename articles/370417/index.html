  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Wap-Click: a simple option to fuck (money from) subscriber</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2ee/835/3f5/2ee8353f55fc4629b6f9622cd08627e8.jpg"></div><br>  Relatively honest ways of taking money from the population is a popular form of income, you know.  I'm sure you've heard of subscriptions.  Or even paid for them.  Cellular operators call such services differently: ‚ÄúMy Content‚Äù, ‚ÄúContent Subscriptions‚Äù, but the essence is the same.  To provide such services (according to the assurances of OpSoSov), you must first specify your number, receive an SMS with a confirmation code, enter this same code, and then send you the conditions in the message.  See how honest everything is!  So where do all these unfortunate people come from, who claim that they have been fooled, deceived them, and are not going to return the money?  Probably they foolishly did not click there and signed up.  Anything can happen.  One day, my grandmother registered instead of "Classmates" in "Sex-Graders" or something like that.  Vision is not the same, you know.  However, she is a curious old woman, maybe she was not mistaken.  But you are all young and savvy!  You just can not take it.  Who in their right mind will send SMS to short numbers, right?  And what if I tell you that no confirmation is needed?  And no subscription information you get.  And the only way to learn about charges is to see the details.  So it goes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I do not even know how to describe this happiness.  Let's just quote from the popular Wap-Click affiliate program: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs enough for a subscriber to press one button to complete a subscription (...), and debiting from his account occurs unnoticed and every day!‚Äù Sounds radically, you can‚Äôt say anything.  Now more.  But I'll start from afar.  Here you pay on the Internet for something with a card and you receive a confirmation code on the phone.  You enter this code.  Where?  That's right, on the page of your bank.  There you and the amount and the recipient.  In short, it looks safe.  Now back to the subscriptions.  That is, to Wap-Click'am.  To participate in scam you need to do just one click.  Where?  And where the site owner wants.  And the appearance of the page can also be any.  And so that you carelessly did not press the wrong button, there will be only one button.  Big and beautiful, of course.  And her name may be harmless.  You are going to watch the video, here's the ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù button.  Press and op!  Hello, dear customer!  No, all your debits are legal.  Contact your content provider.  Do you think it's worse nowhere?  Do not believe it is.  Especially clever (that is, almost all) the barges with paid content make the <b>entire page</b> clickable.  They wanted to scroll down the text to read the conditions of the robbery, put a finger on the smartphone and accidentally tapped it.  All welcome to the club. <br><br>  Operators, of course, are struggling with this.  But they will not fight.  Apparently, the subscription mafia is too strong.  So hope in this war is only for themselves.  Now we will be engaged in self-defense.  The most effective method, the latest development of operators, directed against the insidious enemy of each subscriber is a content account.  Weapons can be said to be secret.  Operators do not rush to recommend this service on the pages with instructions on how to combat subscriptions.  But here, not everything is simple.  Beeline has a content account with autocompletion from the main account.  I will repeat once again.  Beeline has a content account with autocompletion.  It's very nice that the operator takes care of you even in this case, as many tears of joy come to me!  But there is no autocompletion.  That is, there are two services and you need not to lose vigilance for a second when you connect these same services.  MTS also has such a separate account.  Also a trick.  If your content account has not been debited (of course it was not!) Within six months, it will be closed.  So that you do not relax.  Megaphone went farther.  Here, it seems to me, write-offs cannot be avoided at all.  No, they also have a content account.  But he will not help you.  The fact is that reliable services, according to Megaphone, are paid by providers with the help of such a thing as ‚ÄúMobile payments‚Äù.  The scheme is muddy: first, the money is transferred to some partner, and then they disappear.  Among the selected sites there is everything that the soul desires.  Say ******. Ru - what is not a good subscription?  In short, beware.  Especially if you have large amounts in your account or Megaphone Bank Card.  So go ahead, never go on a bdili!  Look like the last time! <br><br>  Finally, I note that the relevance of the information provided is not guaranteed.  Operators often and deftly change the conditions, so the best way to unsubscribe is to check for a support call.  The state of affairs of the other operators in your region, specify the same way.  All the best to you, happiness, health, horoscope, game, dating and love, fashionable video channel, world of music, comedy club, video world 29.99 rub.  in a day. </div>
