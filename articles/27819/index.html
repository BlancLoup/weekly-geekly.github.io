In a short time, he turned the small computer company Pixar into one of America‚Äôs best movie studios.  How he did it - <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/22/books/review/Hirschorn-t.html">writes the NY Times</a> . <br><br>  Studio Pixar was founded in 1979 by George Lucas after the success of his "Star Wars".  At that time, it was simply called ‚ÄúComputer Division‚Äù and was the computer unit of Lucasfilm.  Lucas invited the best specialists in computer graphics, but did not know what to do with them.  The film "The Empire Strikes Back" in 1980 came out without any computer special effects. <br><br>  In 1986 ‚ÄúComputer Division‚Äù was decided to separate into a separate company and find an external investor.  The company was renamed Pixar, and its leaders appeared before Steve Jobs.  Even then, Steve's personal fortune was $ 185 million, and he was a cult figure of sorts.  His offer of $ 5 million was first rejected, but after an unsuccessful search for another investor, the studio owners finally agreed on such a sum.  Jobs initially saw great promise in the technology of three-dimensional animation.  For a decade, he bent his line and continued to believe in.  As always, intuition did not let Steve down.

      It must be said that throughout the protracted decade-long crisis, Jobs used all his authority and influence to keep control of the studio.  In 1991, he inexplicably persuaded employees to give up their stakes in exchange for maintaining his personal patronage over the company.  In the mid-90s, Steve insisted on holding an IPO. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  All this happened before the release of ‚ÄúToy Story‚Äù in 1995, the first full-length film Pixar, which was a real breakthrough, collected a lot of prizes and brought more than $ 350 million. deal.  But here, too, the experience of Steve Jobs did his job, so that Pixar studio came out of the conflict as the winner. <br><br>  In fact, it turned out that Steve Jobs used Disney‚Äôs capital to promote Pixar‚Äôs own brand and create a powerful studio that eventually became the main rival of the former patron. <br><br>  Analysts agree that Jobs managed to circle the partners around his finger and implement a very competent combination.  If it were not for him, Pixar studio would hardly have achieved such success.  Actually, they are unlikely to do 3D-animation at all.  As you know, after the ‚ÄúToy Story‚Äù she released a number of masterpieces, including ‚ÄúMonsters, Inc.‚Äù, ‚ÄúFinding Nemo‚Äù, ‚ÄúRatatouille‚Äù, etc. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27819/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27819/</a></p>
