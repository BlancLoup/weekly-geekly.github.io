At ITMO University, these issues are taken seriously - and not only support and develop projects on the blockchain, but also teach blockchain technologies as part of one of the master's programs.  More on this in today's material. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/spbifmo/blog/335734/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/78f/cee/4dd/78fcee4ddc684005b3c98cdb89b79e3e.jpg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a>  <i>/ Photo <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/riseconf/35705303602/">RISE</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC-BY</a></i> <br><br><h2>  Department of MFTI </h2><br>  The students of ITMO University study blockchain technologies within the framework of the master's program ‚Äú <a href="https://abit.ifmo.ru/program/6734/">Mathematical Physics and Information Theory</a> ‚Äù.  This master program was launched last year at the Basic <a href="http://finq.ifmo.ru/">Department of</a> Mathematical Physics and Information Theory (MFTI) of the ITMO University.  The department itself was also created not so long ago - in 2015, together with the Mathematical Institute.  V. A. Steklov RAS (POMI RAS).

      At the department of MFTI they are engaged in solving both fundamental scientific and applied problems.  Employees of the department - experts in the field of quantum computing, information theory and computational mathematics.  The fundamental issues that are studied at the department include research in the field of quantum computing (the study of quantum chains of qubits, optical methods of manipulating qubits, statistical properties of integrable quantum systems). <br><br>  The field of applied research includes issues of financial mathematics (methods of quantum measurements and pricing in financial markets: energy, real estate, insurance), social discounting.  In addition, the department is engaged in the development of financial information communication languages ‚Äã‚Äã(in particular, on the basis of the XBRL standard, which allows to structure the exchange of financial data) and study modern methods for calculating credit risks. <br><br>  The main task of the master program is to train specialists in the field of mathematical physics, information theory, quantum computing.  Since the department staff conduct active research work, undergraduates have the opportunity to participate in funded research (including those related to blockchain technologies) or to work on their own projects - this initiative is only encouraged at the department. <br><br><h2>  New Master Program </h2><br>  The undergraduates of the program study blockchain technologies along with the methods of mathematical physics, information theory, quantum computing, multi-agent technologies and a number of other areas of information theory. <br><br>  The idea to include the blockchain in the educational program emerged from <a href="http://www.ifmo.ru/ru/viewperson/279/rybin_andrey_vladimirovich.htm">Andrei Rybin</a> (Candidate of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Head of the Laboratory of Modern Communication Technologies and Their Applications in Economics and Finance, and Deputy Head of the Department) in the course of communication with colleagues from MIT. <br><br>  There they are actively engaged in the issues of teaching students the technologies used in the financial sector, as well as the creation of a <a href="http://www.mitfintech.com/">fintech ecosystem of</a> startups.  By the way, last month Nir Shavit, a world-class scientist from MIT, visited the ITMO University Summer School as a lecturer.  We told about it <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/science/it/news/6821/">here</a> . <br><br>  The University ITMO decided to adopt the approach of American colleagues - and to provide students with the opportunity not only to study modern technologies, but also actively apply them in practice.  Andrey Rybin emphasizes that independent projects and the creation of working technological businesses is an important element of the educational process: <br><br><blockquote>  If the student is focused on business, we will help with the creation of a startup and access to the real industry.  There are a lot of potential research topics, and we are not going to artificially limit this circle. <br><br>  - <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/education/cooperation/news/5831/">Andrey Rybin</a> </blockquote><br>  By the way, within the framework of the master's program ‚ÄúMathematical Physics and Information Theory‚Äù, students have all the opportunities to learn from the experience of their foreign colleagues (and not only from MIT).  Classes with future masters are not only scientists of the ITMO University, but also teachers of the St. Petersburg branch of the Mathematical Institute.  V.A.  Steklov RAS and St. Petersburg State University, as well as leading scientists of the University of Brunel and Imperial College London (UK), University of California at Berkeley (USA) and other partner organizations. <br><br>  The laboratory and the department of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology took part in large international projects (such as the Russia-Finland Cross-Border Cooperation Program, the European Framework Program (FP7). And current students can take part in one of the large-scale initiatives that ITMO University scientists are developing now we will tell them below. <br><br><h2>  Where the undergraduate to prove himself: research and initiatives </h2><br>  One of the final stages of training in the magistracy - writing a master's thesis.  Students will work on it under the guidance of scientists from partner organizations.  At the same time, a master's thesis can be created based on the results of participation in one of the international projects supported by the department, - funds from the projects are also sent to support student research projects. <br><br>  For example, you can take part in projects under the Federal Target Program ‚ÄúResearch and development in priority areas of development of the scientific and technological complex of Russia for 2014‚Äì2020‚Äù in the field of the Internet of Things.  Or participate in research that is supported by the European program Horizon 2020. <br><br>  The Horizon 2020 program funds the <a href="http://www.biotope-project.eu/">bIoTope</a> project, which aims to develop an infrastructure for horizontal interaction between the Internet of things.  Researchers at ITMO University in the framework of participation in the project investigate, among other things, the use of the blockchain for organizing the interaction of smart objects: <br><br><blockquote>  In addition to the well-known use in cryptocurrencies, blockchain technologies make it possible to take processes beyond the framework of human-to-person or human-to-service interaction.  Using the mechanism of smart contracts, you can build business processes that will take place without operator participation, with a high degree of trust and a low cost of supporting this infrastructure. <br><br>  - <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/science/it/news/6164/">Oleg Sadov</a> , employee of the laboratory of modern communication technologies at ITMO University </blockquote><br>  Andrei Rybin <a href="http://www.coinfox.ru/novosti/persony/6012-andrej-rybin-nashi-studenty-budut-rabotat-s-ethereum">notes</a> that within the framework of this program, the department‚Äôs specialists are implementing a large project on the Etherium platform.  And they also help students with the creation of diploma works in the blockchain area: they are associated with the implementation of the ‚Äúsmart city‚Äù concept (the use of smart contracts to solve the problem of exporting municipal waste). <br><br><h2>  Other ITMO University projects on the blockchain </h2><br>  After graduation, masters have several opportunities to apply their knowledge and skills: continue their studies at the International Postgraduate School of ITMO University, work in research projects or companies, or develop their own technological project started at the university. <br><br>  Among the initiatives already implemented at ITMO University and working on the blockchain are, for example, ‚Äú <a href="http://drone-employee.com/">Dron-Employee</a> ‚Äù.  As part of this project, a UAV control system based on smart contracts is being developed.  More about her, we told in <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/spbifmo/blog/315750/">this</a> material. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JnwstVJFZAk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Speech by Sergey Lonshakov (ITMO University graduate), blockchain developer, Airalab Developer Leader at Blockchain &amp; Bitcoin Conference Russia 2017</i> <br><br>  Another development of ITMO University graduates is the <a href="http://aira.life/">Aira</a> project (Autonomous Intelligent Robot Agent), which is not just connected with building interaction between humans and robots based on smart contracts.  The creators of Aira aim to form new markets within the framework of such interaction - and for this they formulated the <a href="http://aira.life/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Aira_robot_economics_doctrine.pdf">doctrine of the</a> economics of robots and developed a technological platform for its practical implementation. <br><br>  ‚ÄúDron-employee‚Äù is one of the projects, which is built on Aira technology solutions.  To date, the Aira project has raised $ 220,000 in investment from the pre-seed fund of the Satoshi Fund Company and completed the first stage of the ICO (95 investors invested 5,000 airs into the project, buying 585,000 Air tokens).  By the end of this year, the team plans to organize the development of infrastructure solutions for the markets of the economy of robots, as well as to collect data (for analytics services) for one of the industrial partners of the project. <br><br><h2>  By the way </h2><br>  Today (August 16) and tomorrow (August 17) in St. Petersburg at the Museum of Street Art is held <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/announce/35249/">ICO-Hypethon</a> , a partner of which is ITMO University.  The participating teams will compete for the prize pool and prepare for the launch of pre-ICO, while the visitors will have a festival part: speakers' speeches (among them, Vnesheconombank Chairman‚Äôs Advisor Vladimir Demin, Waves Platform CEO Alexander Ivanz, CryptoPay managing director Eric Benz and others), educational films about the blockchain, live broadcasts from the competition and the musical arena. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/335734/">https://habr.com/ru/post/335734/</a></p>
