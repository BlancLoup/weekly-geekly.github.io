      The Big Data industry provides space for such a jump.  After a surge of interest in big data and a wave of first disappointments, the technology begins to find application in a wide range of real projects.  For example, in December, Yandex announced the launch of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/yandex/blog/245393/">Yandex Data Factory</a> , and last week another startup in the field of Big Data received $ 56 million dollars in investments. <br><br>  International sources are also optimistic: IDC calls big data one of the <a href="http://sdtimes.com/idcs-top-10-technology-predictions-2015/">most important technological trends in 2015,</a> and the authoritative magazine Inc.  includes Big Data in the <a href="http://www.inc.com/aaron-skonnard/the-top-6-tech-skills-you-need-in-2015.html">top 6 of the most important technological competencies of</a> this year.  The Glassdoor recruiting service called Data Scientist <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/12/03/hot-tech-jobs/">the hottest IT profession in</a> 2015 at all. <br><br>  And most importantly: in Russia, despite the crisis, there is also a huge demand for Big Data specialists ‚Äî we learned this empirically.  Even at the initial stages of the preparation of the program, leading technology companies began to contact us in the search for employees specializing in big data.  Now we have six specific offers from companies (these are banks, retail and mobile operators), ready to take on our graduates.  In general, the time to enter the industry is the most favorable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/776/c60/99c/776c6099c544443eab68dd7bc6e034cc.png"><br>  <i>If we consider the Big Data on the maturity curve (hype cycle), about which <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/198506/">Habr wrote</a> not so long ago, now the technology is at the stage of ‚Äúenlightenment slope‚Äù</i> <br><br>  <b>Training through practice</b> <br>  So, the goal of our program is to teach developers and technical specialists to practice solving the most important tasks that Big Data specialists are engaged in.  This approach is reflected in the structure of the course.  The course consists of three specific cases, each of which takes 1 month.  It: <br><ul><li>  Social Graph Analysis </li><li>  Creating multi-class classifiers based on web log analysis </li><li>  Development of recommendation systems </li></ul><br>  From our point of view, these are the most important tasks in the field of data analysis, and we will provide students with complete immersion in each topic. <br><br>  <b>Only industry representatives teach</b> <br>  Our teachers are experienced practitioners who create applications based on big data with their own hands.  <a href="">Valery Topinsky</a> (eks-Yandex, ShAD), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/konstantinkruglov">Konstantin Kruglov</a> (founder of Data-Centric Alliance), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kinshukmishra">Kinshuk Mishra</a> (Spotify) and other people from leading Russian and international companies using Big Data will conduct classes on the course at different times.  The industry is changing very rapidly, and we are giving skills and skills that are relevant right now. <br><br>  Each student will also receive a personal tutor who will regularly monitor progress in the performance of laboratory work, look at the code, assist with finding solutions and give feedback. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c8e/f03/0a4/c8ef030a4ed042929333c9d0e56a6a00.png"><br>  <i>Ceo ‚ÄúLaboratories of New Professions‚Äù Dmitry Repin (right) and Director of Educational Programs Alexander Turilin open a lesson</i> <br><br>  <b>Kaggle, real datasets and workshops</b> <br>  Each case study in our program is taught in three stages.  First, students learn to see common patterns and parse well-developed tasks from Kaggle.  Further carry out independent projects with real data under the guidance of tutors.  For example, in the framework of the second case, students will try to optimize the algorithms for displaying advertising in the Data-Centric Alliance system - and those who achieve good results will not only get the approval of the teachers, but also be able to completely recapture the cost of education. <br><br>  In the first two stages, students are given practical skills in the full cycle of working with big data.  It: <br><ul><li>  Deploying Hadoop / HDFS / HBase </li><li>  Pre-processing and data cleaning </li><li>  Prediction model building </li><li>  Selection of the optimal machine learning algorithm </li><li>  Model calibration </li></ul><br>  The third part of the case allows you to get acquainted with ready-made tools and best practices.  Speakers from Yandex, Sberteha, Spotify, MTS, IBM, Cloudera will conduct master classes and tell you how to collect, store and use big data in their companies.  In this block, students will be able to assess how the specificity of data in various industries influences the choice of tools and analysis algorithms. <br><br>  <b>Interview after the course</b> <br>  As mentioned above, while we were preparing the course several companies turned to us in the hope of finding specialists in big data.  Each student who successfully completes the final qualification tasks (by the way, difficult), will have the opportunity to pass an interview.  The strategic partners of the program are Sberbank-Technologies and Data-Centric Alliance, they are ready to hire a large number of qualified people.  We will closely monitor the progress and preferences of each student to help find a job that corresponds to his interests and competence. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ed/b89/cfa/4edb89cfa93142d38af8f2b722834f13.png"><br><br>  <b>Online as offline</b> <br>  Another nice feature is the opportunity to learn from anywhere in the world without losing any quality.  Classes are held at the Digital October center three times a week in the evenings, but you can take part in them remotely.  Students studying online feel that they are full participants in the class thanks to professional multi-camera photography - in the videoconference mode, you can ask questions to the teacher and actively participate in the discussion.  Also, records of all classes are available to students in a private office. <br><br>  <b>Our requirements for students</b> <br>  Now in Russia there are several educational projects for those who want to link their lives with big data - this is Yandex‚Äôs ‚ÄúSchool of Data Analysis‚Äù and the Master‚Äôs program ‚ÄúBig Data Systems‚Äù at HSE - true, they last for several years and are aimed at students and recent graduates. <br><br>  We, on the contrary, are guided by established professionals who want to combine study with work.  The course turned out to be difficult and intense; it will not work for beginners.  We honestly warn that the <a href="http://newprolab.com/bigdata/%3Futm_source%3Dhabra%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3DPost%2520_big_data_course_habra">Big Data Specialist program</a> will have to work very intensively - both in the classroom and beyond, and we await the trained listeners.  The minimum requirements are: <br><ul><li>  Good working knowledge of the basics of probability theory and mathematical statistics </li><li>  Experience in developing applications from 2 years </li><li>  Also (very desirable) to know the basics of the theory of machine learning. </li></ul><br>  <b>PS</b> And we also thought that it was worth giving five talented young developers a chance to enter the program for free.  This is how the Big Data Young Champion competition was born.  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/digitaloctober/posts/856031834458241%3Ffref%3Dnf%26pnref%3Dstory">Participation conditions are</a> on our Facebook page. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/249477/">https://habr.com/ru/post/249477/</a></p>
