      A general overview of social networks was made, an attempt was made to approximate classification, hypotheses were made about the development trends of social networks in the West and the Russian Internet, a small part of the report was devoted to the history of social networks.  The report clearly lacked the depth, structure, and completeness of the terminology, and therefore the report can be classified as an attempt to introduce an introductory lecture on the topic of social networks on the Internet.  Separately, it is worth noting that the speaker mentioned a platform for building social networks on which he is currently working. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <strong>Features broadcast media on the Internet.</strong>  <strong>Vladimir Mikhalko.</strong> <br><br>  Vladimir is the director of Community8, a company that creates personal and corporate websites, social networks and blogs, online stores, news sites and information portals.  Vladimir very clearly showed the audience a lot of problems that all print media face in one way or another, who want to ensure their own presence on the Internet.  I mentioned a lot of factors, CMS, the need to match the business models of the offline edition and its online version, the complexity associated with the server part.  Showed many fairly illustrative examples. <br><br>  <strong>Using the hidden psychophysical capabilities of web developers for the successful creation and implementation of modern Internet projects.</strong>  <strong>Valery Pavlovich Yurikov.</strong> <br><br>  He introduced the modern bio-computer model of man to the attention of the public.  He proposed to consider the programming process as creativity.  Stress states.  Creating sustainable states of comfort, increasing efficiency and psychological stability of web developers.  The state of the speaker is classified, and methods of influence are not described. <br><br>  <strong>Ria in Flex perspective.</strong>  <strong>Alexey Zatvornitsky and Sergey Kovalev.</strong> <br><br>  The concept of Rich Internet Applications has been defined.  Many have said that Ria is a great tool for creating projects like Saas.  The capabilities of the Flex technology were demonstrated and ways of integrating Flex applications with various server technologies - Java, PHP, Ruby on rails etc. were discussed.  I was very impressed by the demonstration of the RIA application (data visualization, interaction with the open Application Programming Interface. <br><br>  <strong>Latest Guidelines for Web Usability.</strong>  <strong>Julia Klimentovskaya.</strong> <br><br>  Very interesting, detailed and well-structured report on the main ways to improve the usability of the site, the various methods of visual display of information on the site (small details) and errors that allow designers and layout designers.  Besides a lot of really concrete and useful information there were many interesting examples.  Perhaps this report in view of the great practical value of the slides and I want to download the most. <br><br>  <strong>New requirements for Internet projects in the light of changes in global financial markets.</strong>  <strong>Denis Dovgopoly.</strong> <br><br>  He mainly talked about the fall in start-ups in price and, due to the overcrowding of the market, there is little chance of selling to the ‚Äúbig three‚Äù.  In addition, it was about the degradation of the advertising model of the development of Internet projects.  After that, the speaker gave the audience a lot of time for questions, which she gladly used. <br><br>  <strong>Raising capital in Start-Up.</strong>  <strong>Yuriy Boyko.</strong> <br><br>  Yuri had a great presentation, answering many interesting questions.  He told about seed and pre-seed financing of start-ups.  Gave characteristics of various financing methods and who can be contacted for investment.  He spoke about the method of choosing the right investor, stressed the importance of creating a first-class team, which 80% determines the success of the project.  Explained the importance of business knowledge to a successful project. <br><br><blockquote>  Official conference site </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/22680/">https://habr.com/ru/post/22680/</a></p>
