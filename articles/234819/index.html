Foursquare for clean drivers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We continue to acquaint the readers of our blog with the most interesting startups placed on the <a href="https://vcstart.com/%3Fref%3Dhabr0011">VCStart venture investment platform</a> .  The choice is based primarily on the evaluation of the startup idea, its social significance, scale and, of course, its investment potential.  The project "To wash the car" with all these qualities, in our opinion, to the extent possessed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/696/9a9/f6a/6969a9f6a1484928b5614506ab50ad9f.jpg"><br><br>  A dirty car is a sure sign that its owner is a <s>pig, a</s> very busy man.  Especially when you see a new expensive car, covered with a two-week layer of dirt and pitiful requests for it to be washed, written for an illiterate "horse" with a sympathetic passer's finger. <a name="habracut"></a>

      A clean and sparkling car, on the contrary, is an indicator of personal care and an elusive reason for the owner's holiday mood, an extraordinary reason to enjoy life.  It is so obvious that it is not immediately clear why there are so many dirty cars on the roads. <br><br>  It becomes clear when on the way to work you stop by the car wash in order to ‚Äúquickly rinse‚Äù, and there are ten more such clever men in front of you in the queue, only quicker.  An attempt to ‚Äúarrive early tomorrow‚Äù turns into the same queue, albeit with a smaller number of participants, and this can be repeated for a very long time. <br><br>  Another popular reason not to wash the car is the mystical expectation of rain.  ‚ÄúWhat if tomorrow?‚Äù ... and now the sink has been left far behind. <br><br>  ‚ÄúBut if it were possible to foresee the rain, see where the nearest car washes are, find out if there is a queue ...‚Äù, the driver of the dirty car dreams, he is sadly driving towards work. <br><br>  Quite right, clean cars on the roads would be many times more, and their drivers would come to work full of optimism and thirst for accomplishments.  This is the conclusion once reached by the creators of the ‚ÄúWash Auto‚Äù service and, inspired by the need for their initiative, set to work. <br><br>  The basis of the service, which would combine for a car wash in all regions of Russia, was taken today the most optimal user interaction tool - a mobile application for the two main platforms iOS and Android.  It is responsible for informing the client about the services of the nearest car washes, based on geolocation data. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f20/1b3/87d/f201b387d95d45babc0c3a6a241ca231.jpg"><br><br>  After downloading the program from the App Store or Google Play, and allowing it to determine its geolocation, the driver immediately receives a list of the car washes closest to him with the address by phone, user rating compiled by the same drivers and the location of the car wash on the map. <br><br>  Yes, before that, the program will help you decide whether to wash the car today or still wait.  This is done based on the weather forecast for the coming days, which is available immediately in the app. <br><br>  Plus, the application will tell you about promotions and discounts on nearby car washes, offer to call there if you want to take a queue in advance, and pave the route for the service on your map.  In the future, the application will be able to pre-pay for services at a discount using a plastic card.  As the creators of the project reported, the functionality for this already exists and is currently being tested in the Project‚Äôs homeland, in Tatarstan. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3d0/630/12e/3d063012e7544fa2b4b79df83fc776d2.jpg"><br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúIn total, more than 150,000 car washes are working with us all over Russia and the CIS, as well as in Europe.  Owners are attracted by the opportunity to talk about their business using our application to hundreds of thousands of drivers - smartphone users.  We have already signed a contract with the Association of Moscow carwash business about connecting 500 car washes in the capital to the WannaWash paid service over the next 2 months with an average check of $ 50.  Also signed contracts with many regions of Russia and Ukraine.  There is an agreement with the Nestgsv accelerator from Silicon Valley to promote our project in the United States, negotiations are underway to scale up the service in China, ‚Äùsaid WannaWash co-founder Denis Marganov. </blockquote><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dkm_T1GS2dM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500003,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjsrs1l4_7mNMfEJ_ViKPSdzB6poQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The business model of the service is related to the monetization principle of today's popular Foursquare: carwash pays for highlighting among competitors and promoting their services, and car owners get free coffee for reviewing carwash and discounts for ordering via the app. <br><br>  Owners of car washes are eager to contact WannaWash - the service provides them with detailed statistics on customers and geo-targeted push advertising for advertising campaigns, the ability to respond to reviews on behalf of the service and the functionality to implement an electronic queue, which significantly saves time and optimizes personnel costs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/879/78a/1d8/87978a1d822846d68de0623c81dad4df.jpg"><br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãentrepreneurs from Kazan has already attracted the attention of not only car users, but also investors.  The startup exists since December last year, and during that time has achieved quite serious results. <br><br>  Having won the TURN8 competition from the i360accelerator platform, the company got the opportunity to go through acceleration in Dubai (UAE) and a seed investment of $ 30K, and received an AA from the Russian Startup Rating for its high investment attractiveness.  This did not go unnoticed by investors, and soon WannaWash received $ 135,000 of seed investments from the investment fund GRAVIZapps with the first in Russia hard-core accelerator Navigator Campus Kazan. <br><br>  Now the opportunity to participate in the development of a promising and successful startup has also appeared with users of <b><a href="https://vcstart.com/%3Fref%3Dhabr0011">the VCStart collective investment platform</a></b> .  WannaWash starts a new round of financing on our platform, making its project accessible to micro-investors. <br><br>  Alienated share is 10%.  In exchange, WannaWash intends to attract an investment of $ 150 thousand.  The money will be spent on the development of the project, and in particular on the promotion of mobile applications in the top positions of mobile markets, the refinement of the functionality and the expansion of the client base in Russia and abroad. <br><br>  Buy a stake in the project WannaWash <a href="https://vcstart.com/project/myt-avto/%3Fref%3Dhabr0011">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/234819/">https://habr.com/ru/post/234819/</a></p>
