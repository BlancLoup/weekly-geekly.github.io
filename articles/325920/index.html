Competent product promotion is always a whole range of the most diverse actions, so I tried to include in the list services and resources that affect its different aspects, from the selection of high-quality, selling content to the analysis of results. <br><br><h3>  Analytics </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e0b/e2a/6da/e0be2a6daed64804b22252ddd7191c5f.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/fullstory-free"><b>Fullstory</b></a> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
      Fullstory collects as much information as possible about users' behavior on the site (clicks, text input, page navigation) and carries out an analysis, based on which conclusions can be drawn about trends.  You can view reports on specific users, conduct a search on a particular action, or click to display statistics on any object on the page.  In addition to analytics, step-by-step logs will also be useful for technical support. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/grade-my-ads"><b>Grade My Ads</b></a> <br><br>  A quick way to learn comprehensive information about the effectiveness of your advertising campaigns on Facebook.  The program summarizes data on funds spent, audience, cost of user involvement and displays them in the form of brief, simple for visual perception of reports, in which you will find, among other things, a general assessment of the effectiveness of the campaign on a 100 point scale. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/keywords-everywhere-2"><b>Keywords Everywhere</b></a> <br><br>  An extension for the Firefox and Chrome browsers that instantly provides information about traffic, competitiveness and cost per click for any keyword that you enter in the search bar.  You can also connect color highlighting for those options whose values ‚Äã‚Äãfall into a given spectrum in the settings to speed up the selection, save them and unload them.  The service works with sites such as Google.com, Google Search Console, Google Analytics, Google Trends, Google Search, UberSuggest, AnswerThePublic.com, Soovle.com, KeywordShitter.com. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/serpstat-2"><b>Serpstat</b></a> <br><br>  Serpstat, a solution from a company specializing in datasets, offers an extensive base of Google autocomplete options for a wide variety of keywords.  In fact, this is one of the ways to answer sacramental questions about what actual problems are facing the user and which of them makes sense to solve.  Having such information in hand, you can more intelligently build a marketing strategy and optimize the site. <br><br><h3>  Feedback </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/87d/a82/6c6/87da826c640c46cd912c00dc9cefa771.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/chatform-ai"><b>chatform.ai</b></a> <br><br>  Mike Gozzo offers a witty way to make polls less boring and more user friendly.  With the chatform.ai service, standard form questionnaires, which everyone tries to brush as far as possible, give way to chat polls.  By contacting the user through the window of any popular messaging system (Facebook Messenger, WeChat, Telegram, LINE, Viber), the chatbot offers the user a number of questions, immediately displaying answers that you can select in one click.  This type of presentation simplifies the process by breaking it up into micro-interactions, and makes it more informal. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/gotcha"><b>Gotcha</b></a> <br><br>  If the feasibility of polls in the chat is doubtful for you, perhaps a Gotcha compromise solution will suit you.  The basic principle here is the same - the survey is divided into micro-steps, each of which does not take a lot of time from the user, and is performed in the background.  Only the format is different - Gotcha uses pop-up windows with questions instead of chat. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/pepper-2"><b>Pepper</b></a> <br><br>  A widget for sites that groups all available channels of communication and lists them by clicking on a noticeable icon in the corner of the screen.  Checkout the window and get the ready code can be directly on the developer's site.  Available to include pages in popular social networks (Facebook, Vkontakte, Twitter, Instagram), Skype, Whatsapp, email, websites, phone number. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/canny-3"><b>Canny</b></a> <br><br>  Canny is a centralized platform for collecting the most relevant feedback and suggestions.  Users get the opportunity to vote for specific features or to offer those that, in their opinion, are missing in the program.  Developers, for their part, can give feedback by ticking the amendments and innovations that have been taken into account using the appropriate statuses.  Thus, a dialogue is built up that is useful for both parties: the team receives comprehensive information about what the audience expects from them, first-hand;  users see reactions to their comments. <br><br><h3>  Content </h3><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a7/58f/937/2a758f9373464d2389a4080d1a74d979.jpg" width="550"></div><br><br>  <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/pinggo"><b>Pinggo</b></a> <br><br>  Useful simulator for startups who have not yet filled their hands on writing high-quality press releases.  The interactive tool works on the text along with you, first asking typical ‚Äújournalistic‚Äù questions to gather the necessary information, and then compiling a draft press release on the basis of the answers.  Such a scheme helps to understand how to select information and what the structure of the text should be, although we would probably not recommend using such a semi-finished automatic assembly for distribution.  PingGo also offers tools for building a base of journalists in your sector that you should refer to. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/hemingway-editor-3-0"><b>Hemingway Editor 3.0</b></a> <br><br>  Hemingway is probably not the author for everyone, but his brevity and capacity is something that many websites and press releases are definitely lacking these days.  A tool with a speaker called Hemingway Editor 3.0 uses algorithms built on the basis of the rules that the classic formulated to analyze texts, pointing out problem areas, offering alternatives and giving an overall assessment of readability.  These hints help make the text more concise, informative and easy to read.  For team work, it is possible to upload text with edits to Word and PDF documents. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/everypixel"><b>Everypixel</b></a> <br><br>  Service for the selection of high-quality and relevant photos on your page or blog.  The search is performed for more than 50 resources, which include both stock websites of free photos and paid collections, with the latter being a price comparison feature.  You can narrow the circle by sorting the output according to various parameters (from orientation to image type) and searching for a similar image.  The developers describe their creation in the following way: "like Google Images, only for licensed images." <br><br><h3>  Branding </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f88/a03/844/f88a03844b5d489999eb0ce2090e8aaf.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/emblem"><b>Emblem</b></a> <br><br>  The developers convincingly ask not to mix their solution with the banal logo generators - Emblem, according to them, practices a more flexible and deep approach.  This service allows you to think of the visual component of the brand (from the logo to the brand colors and design of the landing), experimenting with different options in the web editor.  With a minimum of finished materials, you can build a complete concept. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/viable"><b>Viable</b></a> <br><br>  Viable checks if the name you have planned for your project is being used by other products or companies.  Among the sources for which the search is made, the creators name such resources as Domainr, Markify, App Store, Product Hunt, Angel List and Pearson. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/startup-pitch-decks"><b>Startup Pitch Decks</b></a> <br><br>  A selection of product presentations from companies that later became major players in their sector is a good source of ideas, inspiration and reflections on the recipe for success. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/325920/">https://habr.com/ru/post/325920/</a></p>
