Automation of workflow and work with clients is the first whale on which the conveyor work of any agency stands.  This is the first and most non-obvious way to save studio funds and, as a result, to release uselessly loaded management resources for useful work. <br><br>  Thanks to the approach described below, WebCanape achieved high performance at the start without increasing the cost of scaling a team.  Only after 5 years of work, we have a dedicated sales department.  Prior to this, a stream of 120 applications per month with a conversion of 60% was processed by one person.

      But speed is not only savings, it is also loyal customers.  Who will make the first KP order and sneakers :) A real entrepreneur with money will most likely choose the first proposal he likes, rather than spend time waiting for various options. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Basic business processes of the studio at the sales stage </h3><br>  Consider the basic business processes that are in any web studio. <br><br><ul><li>  Incoming accounting </li><li>  Sending questionnaire, brief </li><li>  Processing brief calculation cost </li><li>  KP preparation </li><li>  Preparation of the contract and applications </li><li>  Invoicing </li><li>  Bill payment </li></ul><br>  The application must be accepted, entered into the accounting CRM system (5 minutes), the data transferred to the base part of the brief and sent to the client (another 5 minutes).  After the client has filled out the brief, it needs to be processed, make a calculation (20 minutes) and prepare a thoughtful commercial offer (40 minutes) with a preliminary site structure and services.  On the preparation of the contract and applications will take another 30 minutes, 10 minutes to invoice. <br><br>  On the implementation of these processes in one application, the standard sales department takes about 110 minutes of net time.  This means that it takes 128 hours to process 70 applications.  When recalculating for a large number of applications - these are significant losses that are not needed by the client, but affect the final cost of the product.  At the same time, the web studio for some reason tries to optimize the production work (the process of creating a product), and not these empty processes.  Let's see what we did. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><p>  <b>It was</b> </p><br></td><td><p>  <b>It became</b> </p><br></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Incoming accounting </p><br></td><td><p>  five </p><br></td><td><p>  one </p><br></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Sending questionnaire, brief </p><br></td><td><p>  five </p><br></td><td><p>  one </p><br></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Processing brief calculation cost </p><br></td><td><p>  40 </p><br></td><td><p>  25 </p><br></td></tr><tr><td><p>  KP preparation </p><br></td><td><p>  20 </p><br></td><td><p>  one </p><br></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Preparation of the contract and applications </p><br></td><td><p>  thirty </p><br></td><td><p>  3 </p><br></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Invoicing </p><br></td><td><p>  ten </p><br></td><td><p>  one </p><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  To process 70 applications per month, the manager needed 128 hours (full-time sales manager).  After streamlining and automating processes, it was 37 hours.  Now you see why we worked for a long time without a dedicated sales department.  The only thing is very important to have an experienced person at the entrance.  Automation itself will not work. <br><br><h3>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãand interchangeability </h3><br>  Step by step, realizing the problem of low efficiency, we created a system that helped managers work with clients more quickly.  I have already said why speed is more important than cost, but I did not say another problem. <br><br>  For many, it comes to the fore.  Sales Manager can not prepare a professional KP.  Where can I get salespeople with experience selling sites when they are not in the regions? <br><br>  Accordingly, we needed to provide a tool that will help good managers with little experience in the field of web development to quickly manage documents and create professional controls. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/000/5cf/48e/0005cf48efae486f8a79953628e78e0c.jpg"><br>  Calculating the value of the transaction and issuing a quotation <br><br>  This tool was our internal tool, which we called the ‚ÄúCalculator‚Äù.  Much later, he was reborn as CanapeCRM, which we began to offer to clients. <br><br>  Electronic documents.  We are 100% abandoned Vordovskie documents and went online.  Only the link is sent to the client (to brief, KP, contract, invoice).  If something changes - it is enough to make changes to the document in the system, press F5 and the client has already updated the document.  From the savings on this and similar processes - there is a high efficiency. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d36/777/dfc/d36777dfc80c4b63a9a71d819fb9407c.jpg"><br>  Accounting applications and brief for the client <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a15/ab0/650/a15ab065009f47f391eea67bbd41d1da.jpg"><br>  Contract formation <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f54/bdb/042/f54bdb04237e4edcbd2e81656489e4e1.png"><br>  Invoicing and on-line payment <br><br>  <b>Automatic notifications.</b>  The second important part of automation is alerts.  In the process of work, the manager is forced to write a large number of letters to clients who do not carry important information.  It is necessary for the client to report the status of the project, request information, tell what to prepare for the upcoming stages, etc.  When there are a lot of projects, it distracts greatly from the main task, makes it switch and slows down the work.  The CRM system can and should itself inform the client of information, send reminders. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/5eb/eec/18d/5ebeec18d39349d8a2ae9c183b7c0c76.png"><br>  Reminders to the manager and analyst <br><br><h3>  One day that will save a million </h3><br>  Spend this day on a complete system setup.  Notification texts, KP templates, contracts and everything that can be useful.  This will help you to work more profitably and not to grow in value following the growth of salaries. <br><br>  For all questions you can write in the comments to the posts. <br><br>  PS I remind you that this material is a logical <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/twins/blog/309492/">continuation of a series of materials</a> on building a web studio business in the budget segment. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/313550/">https://habr.com/ru/post/313550/</a></p>
