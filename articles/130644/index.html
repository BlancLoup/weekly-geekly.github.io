  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Admob and porn banners</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  My program ‚Äú250+ Solitaire Collection‚Äù for Android brings me a good income due to advertising.  I work with the Google AdMob service.  Until the last week I was quite satisfied with how the service works.  But the last few days have changed my opinion to the opposite. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It all started last Thursday.  I received a letter in which a woman said that she had to remove my program from her Android, since she has children, and porn banners are shown in the program.  I immediately got into the AdMob settings and made sure that advertising for adults is prohibited (it is always prohibited by default).  I apologized to the user and wrote a letter to AdMob support asking them to sort it out. <br><br>  On Friday, I already received two letters stating that porn banners are on the program.  Since I did not receive a response from AdMob, I sent them another email. <br><br>  Saturday was quiet.  But I did not receive a response from AdMob.

      On Sunday, I received three emails from angry users.  Moreover, like the previous three, all were from the United States.  In one of the letters it was said that the banner pictures in the style of sado-maso.  Of course, I once again wrote in support of AdMob, since I have not yet received a response from them. <br><br>  Yesterday (Monday) seven letters arrived.  From one of the letters, I realized that advertising for some service of Flirt is going on in the USA, and that this advertisement has very frank content.  Of course, I once again wrote in support of AdMob. <br><br>  Today is Tuesday.  I never received a single letter from AdMob, but two more letters from angry users.  Last night, after I learned the name of the problem (Flirt), I put a ban on the word Flirt in the AdMob text filter, but this, apparently, did not help. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt believe that I‚Äôm the only one who tried to write about this issue to AdMob support, especially since the problem arose in the US - a key market.  But since it has been almost a week now, no one reacts to this, only one conclusion suggests itself: all emails to the AdMob support team are immediately sent to the recycle bin. <br><br>  From this story I made two conclusions: <br><br>  1) AdMob support services do not exist.  Trying to get at least a formal reply is an empty idea. <br>  2) Through AdMob you can advertise anything.  You can easily advertise porn simply by indicating that this is an entertainment site.  Check advertising before the show does not pass, and since they have no support service, advertising may hang for a very long time. <br><br>  Correctly said that free cheese is possible only in a mousetrap.  By paying $ 25 for registering as an Android developer, you will get no support from Google.  By paying $ 100 a year as an iOS developer, you have a normal Apple support service (tested by experience, the answer always came to me during the day).  I also have the experience of communicating with the Samsung support service, as well as at Apple, you get the answer within 24 hours.  In RIM (Blackberry) there is support, but terrible, you can wait for a response for several days, while paying $ 100 for registration. <br><br>  I am not talking about the quality of support.  But everyone has it, except Google.  If you are writing under Android, then immediately get ready to stop one on one with problems without any support <br><br>  PS A month has passed and now I finally received a response from the AdMob support service.  Yes ... Amazing responsiveness. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130644/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130644/</a></p>
