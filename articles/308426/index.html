How to earn more spending less?  Why only every 100th buys my product?  What is he missing?  Stop!  Let's take it in order. <br><br><h4>  What does the buyer need? </h4><br>  The buyer wants to buy the product - it is clear to anyone and this is beyond doubt.  He wants to find a product, look at the specifications and buy it.  If the buyer did not arrange the goods, he may want to see what is even after a compromise with the wallet and the desire to buy a similar product. <br><br>  On the way of the buyer a lot of problems.  I share them for myself as ‚Äúwho is here?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhere is it?‚Äù And ‚Äúwhat for ??‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Who is there? </h4><br>  Crawling on the Internet traits, the buyer breaks through the pornos to the cherished goal - his purchase.  Cuts the cursor to the right and left popaps, etc.  evil spirits.  And so, forty on the tail brought that far away there are apples of cash.  Our hero is there, and we follow him (just wondering) ... and ... "Who is there?" The first page of the site we hit.  Often - this is a page with SEO text, which is not particularly different literary delights and which often does not carry useful information.  "Ugh, damned!  Dirtied the Internet! ‚Äù- the buyer spits and leaves.

    <h4>  Here "- where exactly? </h4><br>  So, we got an annoying buyer, he obviously had something bad to do, namely, to find the goods on his own in the store.  Well, FIG you!  <a href="http://amac.ru/products/336">We shove the goods away from the eyes</a> , for our "salespeople" everything is logical and correct for how many days already. <br><br><h4>  What for on ?! </h4><br>  The rich "Pinocchio" was not a fool and found all the same "field of miracles."  So it's time to drip.  It seems it is not tricky.  It is only necessary to take a shovel, which was 10 km earlier in the barn, and the grandfather has the key to the barn, but the grandfather is asleep, you can not wake until morning and he will not wake up without pies.  And this is the best option.  And we want to rewrite everyone, <a href="http://www.softkey.ru/catalog/basket.php">so please be fingerprints</a> . <br><br>  In short, something like this.  What is this all about?  To the fact that for a long time, those who create online stores have developed an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat they should be.  And often the idea was not formed as a result of the analysis of the buyer‚Äôs actions, but ‚Äúoh, what a thing on a competitor‚Äôs site, we need exactly the same!‚Äù. <br>  But in fact, an online store, this is a simple store with its own rules.  Even the checkout area is.  And promo girls after cass. <br>  Let's take the best from retail? <br><br>  1. No matter what kind of advertising - it should show the entrance to the store or a specific department. <br>  2. Once entered the store - show the global departments of the store: fish, sausages, meat, milk, bread, tires, dishes, clothes. <br>  3. As soon as a person entered the department, show the subsections: frozen fish, fresh, live, seafood. <br>  4. As soon as the person has put the item in the basket - let him look around: select other sections of the store or choose something else in it.  No need to shout from the speakers in the fish department "Pampers on the baby's zhopka all day !!" (to show what accumulated there during the day is also undesirable) <br>  5. Has the person left the department?  see item 1 <br>  6. Has the person stayed in the department?  see item 3 <br>  7. A person moves to the checkout: we know (here the internet trade is head and shoulders ahead of real stores) that he bought a jar of pineapples, sliced.  What if he bourgeois and forgot the champagne?  or a proletarian and he does not have a can opener?  No tires, no dishwashers, even if they rot in the future in the warehouse (I bought Marinina - they buy this product with a lobotomy knife, a sleeping pill, a gun, hydrogen peroxide, brains). <br>  8. Buyer at the checkout?  Say hello.  For this you do not need to know neither gender, nor name, nor passport data.  Prompt payment options, hint that there are discounts for regular customers.  Do not poke at the customer questionnaires (TC "Carousel"). <br>  9. After the purchase, the visitor sees the promo racks: bought a chocolate bar - get a second one.  Trifle, but nice. <br><br>  <b>Dry facts:</b> <br>  1. Refusal of registration increased traffic envelope 2.4 times (statistics for 3 projects) <br>  2. The presence of intellectual ‚Äúcheckout area‚Äù adds up to 12% of purchases. <br><br><h4>  Shopping Ideas </h4><br>  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãmany things "packages": For builders, for example, create a package of drywall, wood screws, guides, putty, trowel.  Balance the package according to real needs and give the opportunity to buy packages in multiple shares.  Choose a package and remove excess from it sometimes faster than collecting it completely, especially since often the goods in the ‚Äúpackage‚Äù are located in different departments of the store. <br><br>  Refusal to register: often registration is a source of spam from a store that is ineptly trying to return a buyer.  This is annoying, then infuriates, then just infuriates.  Do you think the user will sit and admire the status of the order, which is slowly changing from "accepted" to "delivered"?  Not.  Ask for the only required and important contact - the phone.  Call yourself.  Accurately specify the delivery time, and if you can not cope, then call back and apologize, agree on new ones.  Faceless letters in spam - this is your attitude to the buyer.  After delivery, call back to buyers.  ask if everything is fine, satisfied with the service.  By experience - even if there is little discontent, it will be forgotten because of your call.  People are more often forgiven than soulless machines. <br><br><h3>  Sentence </h3><br>  Post comments in the links to their stores and let others make an assessment of convenience.  So to say testing in practice with maximum efficiency.  The conference is not available for building online stores, so I suggest using Habrom as a ‚Äúcovered‚Äù thematic meadow. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/308426/">https://habr.com/ru/post/308426/</a></p>
