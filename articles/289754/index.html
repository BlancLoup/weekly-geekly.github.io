  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Free to PAY" - the results of the experiment</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  To begin with, a link to the first part of the article: <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/11294/">"" Free to PAY "is an experiment to honestly monetize the game</a> . <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/11294/">"</a>  It has a detailed description of the whole undertaking, voting for "work - it will not work" and a bunch of comments. <br><br>  I will briefly retell the point: a small mobile game with a finite gameplay, there‚Äôs nothing to sell inside, I don‚Äôt want to embed banner ads, as well as a standard ‚Äúfritupley-kit‚Äù.  But at least somehow repel costs, of course, I want to.  Question: how to monetize?  A tentative answer: to make the most good, completely free game, and only after passing to offer the player to pay for the received emotions and consumed content.  No sooner said than done. <br><br>  A little more than a month has passed since the launch of the game and we can already safely draw conclusions.  For details, welcome under the cat, but for now here is a picture for you that most accurately conveys my emotions from the results of the experiment:

Not that this was a surprise, but I wanted to believe in the best, because even in the voting, the item ‚ÄúEverything will turn out‚Äù was not in the last place: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/878/a91/389/878a9138967949f7915214965e1fe53f.png"></div><br><br>  Well, now the main thing is numbers.  Launched the game on iOS and Android March 12, 2015.  (i.e. month and 1 week have passed): <br><br>  <b>iOS</b> : <br><ul><li>  <b>30,000</b> installations </li><li>  <b>$ 126</b> (gross, before deducting 30%) </li><li>  ARPU: <b>$ 0.0042</b> (average earnings per player) </li><li>  The percentage of people paying: <b>0.2%</b> </li><li>  Average bill: <b>$ 2.14</b> (there were 59 payments in total) </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Android</b> : <br><ul><li>  <b>100,000</b> installations </li><li>  <b>$ 176</b> (gross, before deducting 30%) </li><li>  ARPU: <b>$ 0.0018</b> (average earnings per player) </li><li>  Paying percentage: <b>0.07%</b> </li><li>  Average bill: <b>$ 2.61</b> (for a total of 69 payments) </li></ul><br>  I will make a reservation that I broke the experiment's purity a bit: initially everything was free and achievable in the game without buying additional currency, but I could not stand it and filled in an update in which premium levels were sold for coins, and for all 3 premium levels of coins issued in As a reward, it should not be enough.  But, apparently, it did not really affect the payments - here is the schedule of installations and payments on iOS with the date of update marked: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff2/e2e/9da/ff2e2e9da6e54dbc8133d277802a9bdb.png"></div><br><br><h3>  What happened, what did not work: </h3><br>  1) <b>High marks</b> <br>  <u>Thought</u> : <i>we make a quality game with soft monetization;</i>  <i>get good reviews;</i>  <i>it helps to get to the tops and in general has a positive effect on conversions in both installations and payments.</i> <br>  <u>Reality</u> : estimates - space, reviews - a fairy tale!  On iOS - 4.9, on Android - 4.8: <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d2/aca/3c5/2d2aca3c52564c9fbccb635e5a361e02.png"></div><br>  2) <b>Word of mouth</b> <br>  <u>Thought</u> : the <i>main thing for us is to grab more players, and there the quantity will turn into quality even with low ARPU.</i>  <i>But you can count on real word of mouth only with soft monetization, since</i>  <i>advising a friend a game that is not sharpened for the exhaustion of money, should be more comfortable than the next game of the pay-to-win genre</i> <br>  <u>Reality</u> : on the one hand, some kind of viral growth is not observed, on the other hand, various resources can be written about the game for free, and players periodically receive reviews like ‚Äútold all friends‚Äù, ‚ÄúI saw from a friend and decided that the game should be on my phone ‚Äùetc. <br><br>  3) <b>Players will pay if you tell them about the value of the game.</b> <br>  <u>Thought</u> : <i>many simply do not think that books, movies and games do not arise from the air, that this is work and it should be paid for.</i>  <i>But this does not mean that people are deliberately determined not to pay for all this - you just need to push them in the right direction, sow the right thought in their heads, at the right time to tell why the game is free, but still worth paying for it</i> <br>  <u>Reality</u> : No, that‚Äôs not how it works.  Even if the player realizes that he should pay for the game, he is still not ready to pay after the fact for what he has already received for free.  At the end of the game, I propose to buy game currency, but from it there is no longer any pros, if you have passed the game.  Need to sell something really valuable, even if it is served in the sauce ‚Äúdid you like the game?  ‚ÄúSupport us with a ruble.‚Äù <br><br>  4) <b>Anchor</b> <br>  <u>Thought</u> : <i>there is such a psychological device with a price (one of the names of which is ‚Äúanchor‚Äù), when the seller shows the customer first an expensive product, and then about the same, but cheaper.</i>  <i>At the same time, something in the head of the buyer clicks and the purchase of the option ‚Äúcheaper‚Äù is perceived as a very profitable deal.</i>  <i>The trick is that, most likely, we would also consider this price high and would not buy anything at all if we did not have in front of the eyes of another, more expensive option.</i>  <i>And what if you first offer the player to pay a lot, and then, if he does not agree, to offer a smaller amount?</i> <br>  <u>Reality</u> : It is important not to overdo it, because, relatively speaking, it is not accepted to pay more than a few bucks for mobile games, and by asking for more, you can achieve the opposite result by setting the initially loyal player against himself.  Now the game is offered to pay 219 rubles.  ($ 3.99) with the subsequent offer to pay less.  As a result, for example, on iOS there are only 7 payments for $ 3.99, but 47 for $ 1.99 (the minimum possible payment) is an order of magnitude more, although the difference is not very big.  It‚Äôs hard to say whether this technique works or the players just pay the minimum possible amount, I don‚Äôt have such fine statistics. <br><br>  In general, I am a little disappointed and I will continue to approach monetization more harshly, but no one can reproach me with the words ‚Äúyou didn‚Äôt even try, greedy bastard!‚Äù =) <br><br><h3>  What's in the plans for the next update: </h3><br><ul><li>  Add content, including premium levels </li><li>  Tighten the nuts on the balance and monetization </li><li>  Add inapp on $ 1 and offer to pay $ 2 instead of $ 4 </li><li>  Add a couple of life-simplifying products to the store </li><li>  Add the ability to watch video ads with reward for watching (after each level) </li><li>  Improve the ability to ‚Äúshare‚Äù riddles </li></ul><br><br>  There is a lot more that I would like to talk about, but the article turned out to be rather messy, and so if something else is interesting, ask in the comments, I will answer with pleasure. <br><br>  PS To make it clearer that we are generally trying to monetize, let me insert the game trailer: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/R9r3s2cJeZg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi1P6uz4C6QcKPjjFZl-iztnM1qLw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  UPD: 4 more months have passed - we managed to beat off the costs due to video advertising.
