      So, we have added employees to the system, now we want to unite employees into groups.  Each group corresponds to the department in which the employee works, thus the call to the sales department will only come to the sales department, and not anywhere else.  And our employees will not transfer an incoming call to another department.  In the group we set up the logic by which the call will reach the employee we need. <br><br>  Calls to the sales department should be processed as quickly as possible, so that the client does not wait until they advise him.  To do this, choose a strategy - everyone calls.  This means that when you receive a call to the sales department, the call will go to each of the employees and the employees themselves will decide who will work with him. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c1/bd2/3b9/2c1bd23b9611487b9bd9aabd95c717b8.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  After we have selected a number and added employees to the system, we can start creating the logic for processing incoming calls. <br><br>  After receiving an incoming call, we need to ‚Äúsay hello‚Äù to the customer and inform him that he has come to our store.  To do this, record the voice greeting: "Hello, you called the company ...".  Voice greeting can act as an advertising tool.  Competently composed greeting will allow to distinguish the company in the market and make it memorable, against the background of competitors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/030/dc2/8bd/030dc28bde454328bf15b32598adbfb7.JPG" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/86e/567/532/86e567532bf844c1899742f87c804b7e.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  What we finally get: <br>  Voice greeting is a powerful tool that can be used not only to inform the client, but also for branding.  Not so many online stores can afford a voice greeting, when we first contact, we at least create an image of a company that is not the first day on the market, but at the most - we stand out from the competition. <br><br>  <b>So, we have a number, we have a greeting, what next?</b> <br><br>  Since our store is open from 9:00 to 18:00.  We need to consider scenarios when a call from our potential client comes during business hours and during non-working hours. <br><br>  If the call came during business hours, we need to distribute the callers to the necessary departments.  The customer who is interested in the delivery of goods should not get into the sales department, and the customer who wants to buy a phone should not get into the accounting department.  To do this, add a voice menu, where the user can choose with which department he needs to contact, if the client is difficult to choose - send him to the sales department.  We write down the voice greeting: "In order to contact the sales department, press 1 if you have a question on the delivery time of the goods - 2, to contact the accounting department - 3".  Thus, we sort and weed out unnecessary calls that will distract our employees from performing tasks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a1/d47/aa6/4a1d47aa6c074fd996928416a1baef29.JPG" alt="image"><br><br><hr><br>  <i>In the next part, we will talk about what to do with calls that are received during off-hours, how to evaluate the effectiveness of employees on the phone, and how not to lose potential customers.</i> <br><br>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/ringcloud/blog/14286/">Now I am the owner of an online store (Part 1)</a> |  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/ringcloud/blog/14416/">Now I am the owner of an online store (Part 3)</a> <br><hr></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289680/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289680/</a></p>
