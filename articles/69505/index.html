Take a certificate, register, deregister, register, etc.  And each time you have to stand for hours waiting for one or two treasured pieces of paper or seals.  In today's article, I would like to talk about how we personally <b>deal</b> with the <b>problem of queues</b> (there is a fairly large flow of visitors in our Department [UFRS in the Kurgan Region], so the task is quite relevant). <br><br>  Just want to talk about the purpose of the article: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      First, I would like to show you how to solve complex problems in simple ways.  It is not necessary to buy advanced software, install, configure, etc.  Some things can be solved quite gracefully, would be, as they say, head and hands. <br><br>  Secondly, I would like to shake the conviction that state bodies are some kind of soulless bureaucratic machine that uses outdated technologies and methods of work.  Of course, not all go with the times, but there is a positive experience.  I would be glad if after reading someone can take another look at our work. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Task</b> <br><br>  So, to begin with I will describe the problem that we solve.  When visitors are received, the main problem is, of course, the queue.  One of the departments takes just on our floor, so that 10-15 people are constantly in the corridor.  Such, alas, is the real picture.  The ideal picture should look like this: every visitor knows the exact time when they should accept him, and comes 5-10 minutes before that time.  The entire schedule of reception is clearly painted, in the corridor waiting for 2-3 people, no noise.  This approach is called an <b>‚Äúelectronic queue‚Äù</b> and is already being used in some places (in banks, private medical clinics, etc.) <br><br>  Ideally, an entry in the "electronic queue" should be available from everywhere. <br><br>  Option one: a person calls on the phone, calls the name, the specialist writes it at the right time. <br>  Option two: through the information and reference terminal. <br>  Option Three: via the web interface (right on the official site) <br><br>  Plus, of course, all this should be implemented in a convenient form so that everything can be immediately seen, and the addition of a person takes place with a minimum of mouse movements. <br><br>  <b>Implementation</b> <br><br>  The entire system was written in PHP and runs on a local web server.  To log in to a specialist, it is enough to open a browser (click on the shortcut on the desktop) and login. <br><br>  By default, the record for the current date is shown (the pictures are clickable): <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/107/679/ceb/107679cebea56e4bcab74a444430e758.jpg" alt="electronic queue - screenshot 1"></a> <br><br>  You can watch any other day: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f58/4ae/1ec/f584ae1ec8fabde9bc75cc1ffaa9b79b.jpg" alt="electronic queue - screenshot 2"></a> <br><br>  A little bit of explanation: <br>  The whole working day (from 8 am to 8 pm (this is with a margin)) is divided into 4 intervals of 3 hours.  Each interval is still divided into "quanta" of time (10, 12, 15, 20, 30 or 60 minutes) - the time of reception of one visitor. <br><br>  The system takes into account all work schedules, lunch breaks and pre-holiday days.  Inactive cells are shaded gray. <br><br>  White empty cells are active.  After clicking on it, the form opens to enter the name of the visitor.  One visitor can occupy several cells (if he needs to arrange several documents). <br><br>  Yellow cells are busy.  Green - the visitor came, red - did not come (needed for collecting statistics).  In the event of a visitor‚Äôs refusal, our specialist can delete him and write a new person on top of the vacated cells. <br><br>  In general, the interface is quite understandable and after a couple of explanations, everyone began to use it fairly confidently. <br><br>  <b>Technical implementation.</b> <br><br>  As I mentioned above, everything is written in PHP.  It turned out that everything was not as scary as it had been thought at first - everything fit into two main scripts + several auxiliary ones that are responsible for asynchronous information update every minute (I actively used AJAX requests).  All the work took about two weeks. <br><br>  <b>Benefit.</b> <br><br>  The benefits are obvious - even by the results of the first week, you can see how visitors occupy all the cells quite tightly (rarely remain free).  That is, the system really works!  Now the recording is only on the phone and only in one department.  There is also an unloading of our specialists - earlier, it‚Äôs embarrassing to admit, we made a preliminary record in the Excel file.  Plus, of course, uniform reception of citizens during the day (it happens that everyone will run in the morning, and after lunch, on the contrary, there is no one else). <br><br>  <b>So what is next?</b> <br><br>  We will continue to expand.  To be honest, it will be more difficult and more interesting at the same time. <br>  First, we will introduce them into the second department (two windows work by appointment). <br>  Secondly, it is necessary to write an algorithm that will automatically calculate how much time it takes to receive a visitor - depending on the number of documents, the type of design, etc. <br>  Thirdly, we will introduce a system of preliminary recording on the reference terminal and on the official website.  That is, <b>you can independently (!!!) go to the site, look at the free cells, select the appropriate ones and sign up for this time</b> .  Agree, it is much more convenient than sitting in line.  Or come and find out that, it turns out, there is no reception today. <br><br>  I would appreciate comments, I am ready to answer questions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/69505/">https://habr.com/ru/post/69505/</a></p>
