  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Cattle service" scares customers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In Russia, in general, there has always been little understanding of what a service and a culture of service communication is.  Recently, the situation has improved, but still most of the services are incorrectly served to the client, as a result of which he has a negative opinion about the company. <br><br>  First things first.  <b>Let's start with the sellers.</b>  All of you have been to cell phone dealers and are probably familiar with the situation when several PTUshniki rush at you from the doorway and start telling you about new phone models and where you should invest your money.  I do not know about you, but I have one reaction to these sellers - to hint him roughly, so as not to bother.  In the end, maybe I just got to warm up went :) And if I need a consultation, I will come and ask. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>In grocery stores, there are also individuals.</b>  Once gathered with friends on nature.  I went to the store for liquor, and others for groceries.  I went up to the counter, I said to the saleswoman: "Please, give me five liter bottles of Russian size."  In response, I hear: "And you drink so much?"  I answer: ‚ÄúWhat a difference to you.  How much do I have to pay"?  This is generally a horror, and if I bought 10 condoms, she would probably have asked: "And you throw so many sticks"? <br><br>  <b>Now directly to the services.</b>  A new barbershop opened somehow, and my friend and I decided to go and have a haircut there.  We went, sat, cut us.  By the edge of my ear, I hear my comrade, the hairstylist, during a haircut, begins to say: ‚ÄúHere you have dandruff.  You need to use such shampoos ", etc.  After a while, mine begins a dialogue with me in the spirit: ‚ÄúYou have oily hair, you need to use such shampoos,‚Äù etc.  In general, when we left there, comrade said to me: ‚ÄúWe will never go here again!‚Äù  Everything, without comments ... the hairdressing salon was closed after a while.

      <b>Moving to a more monetary area - banks.</b>  It took me a credit card.  I go to a private bank - a big, beautiful building.  On the threshold the guard stops a menacing roar: ‚ÄúWhere are you going?‚Äù  The AK sawn-off shotgun was aimed at the door, apparently it was not taught that it was impossible to send weapons to people.  I say: "Credit card issue."  I go up to the second floor I go into the office.  Office - a huge room, about a hundred tables with computers.  In this room there are 3 people - a girl and 2 guys, no one else, they sit and drink coffee.  A girl is a maximum of 20 years old, guys are the same.  I say to the girl: "I would like to get a credit card." <br>  She told me: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not necessary, they are often hacked now.‚Äù <br>  I continued: "What documents are needed?" <br>  And then she gives out: ‚ÄúWhy do you need a credit card?‚Äù <br>  I almost said, ‚ÄúA kilogram of cannabis to buy over the Internet,‚Äù but I realized that I shouldn‚Äôt waste my time on idiots, got up, said goodbye and left.  It is not surprising that in the bank as if they were in a cemetery. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/6894/">https://habr.com/ru/post/6894/</a></p>
