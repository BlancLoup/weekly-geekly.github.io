    <h4>  Why do we need startups in the field of e-government? </h4><br><br><br><br>  Just want to make a reservation, there is no ideal model for working with eGov anywhere in the world.  Civil projects solve two tasks: they involve the people in the process of development and assessing the quality of public services, while educating them, and reducing costs.  And we must perfectly understand that civil projects are something that can be massively demanded by society, but is not a priority.  That is, it is not public services, for example.  But then again this may be a ‚Äúcrowded‚Äù monitoring of these services. <br><br>  We decided to put together projects that could become commercially successful and socially significant projects on one platform.  There is a good start in Russia - a large number of developers who, one way or another, with adequate motivation, can develop various kinds of gov 2.0 projects.  IT is massive, with the lowest entry threshold and, once again, that can significantly improve the situation in the eGov area as a whole. <br><br><ol><li>  eGov-startups in Russia: is there a light at the end of the tunnel? </li><li>  Commercialization </li><li>  How is gov2project planning to work? </li><li>  How can the media help? </li><li>  Upcoming Initiative - Code For Russia </li></ol><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  eGov-startups in Russia: is there a light at the end of the tunnel? </h4><br><br>  Light is, if properly build a model.  There are technological projects.  Then the investor does not buy the content component, but the technology.  The strength of the RF is one of the best developers in the world.  It is assumed that there will be more projects of a non-media character, namely, functional ones.  By again, the logic of niche growth is reasonable. <br><br>  Here I can not give so many examples.  But they are indicative.  Take the <a href="http://gov2project.ru/blog/2011/02/streetjournal-org/">StreetJournal</a> project, the attitude towards which at the level of regional authorities is quite constructive.  And it is clear why there is exactly GR: here, for example, Samara became the most active city in <a href="http://gov2project.ru/blog/2011/02/streetjournal-org/">My territory</a> , because the mayor (the first person of the city) began to actively use this project. <br><br>  An excellent example: <a href="http://gov2project.ru/blog/2011/02/karta-pomoshhi-postradavshim-ot-pozharov/">russian-fires.ru</a> and <a href="http://gov2project.ru/blog/2011/02/karta-pomoshhi-v-holoda/">Cold.</a>  <a href="http://gov2project.ru/blog/2011/02/karta-pomoshhi-v-holoda/">Info</a>  I remember what happened when the project was going; for some reason, the authorities did not actively react to it.  And here recently, Grisha <a href="http://alenapopova.ru/gov20/grisha-asmolov-o-vstreche-runetchikov-s-dmitriem-medvedevym.html">was at a meeting with the president</a> as the creator of one of the best practices in the field of Gov2.0.  And thanks to both Grisha and Nastya, the topic of crowdsourcing in Russia has become more than relevant and absolutely constructive. <br><br>  <a href="http://rsp.datagov.ru/">Rosgosfending</a> Vanya Begtin affects the entire movement with respect to public procurement in general.  And Vanya is just more than a technological approach. <br><br>  I am glad that at the last Conference <a href="http://alenapopova.ru/%3Fs%3D%25D0%2593%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2583%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%2B%25D0%25B2%2B21%2B%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%26x%3D0%26y%3D0">‚ÄúThe State in the 21st Century‚Äù,</a> no one of the speakers in my section had to tell, and what projects are there, and why are they boring, etc., etc.  The civil servants themselves talked about their experience with the gov2.0 initiatives.  Sergey Kuchin at the <a href="http://www.itforum2020.ru/">International Forum IT forum 2020</a> in Nizhny Novgorod generally picked up a startup he liked, immediately making the guys both PR and financing. <br><br>  Makar Herman regularly watches all offers on gov2.0 in the Perm region.  Was on our <a href="http://alenapopova.ru/gov20/gov2camp-v-permi.html">Gov2.0 Camp</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/df8BqfeeD2I%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgS_uKbFrZkrGspXSCK3NB9XWbe1g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Commercialization <br></h4><br><br>  What projects can be profitable?  Example: <a href="http://bus62.ru/">bus62.ru</a> developed in Ryazan: inside the project there is a technology that allows you to monitor the movement of public transport equipped with GLONASS sensors.  The technology itself has been developed in such a way that a large digging company became interested in the guys.  Another example.  The RAS has made a project <a href="http://gov2project.ru/blog/2011/04/surdoserver-vash-pomoshnik-v-izuchenii-yazyika-zhestov/">for automatic sign language</a> .  If the project as a technology is developed and sold, say, in Finland, where there are obligations to ‚Äúdevelop projects for people with disabilities‚Äù, then one purchase by the ministry could make the project commercially successful. <br><br>  What projects cannot or are not yet commercially viable, but they generate great user interest and activity and can become the basis for new developments: <a href="http://gov2project.ru/blog/2011/03/gde-kazino/">‚ÄúWhere is the Casino‚Äù</a> or ‚ÄúRoskomvzyatka‚Äù, <a href="http://gov2project.ru/blog/2011/03/ot-menta/">‚ÄúFrom the ment‚Äù</a> , etc.  Some of them are built on the principle of open source and crowd-based model, and therefore they can develop to infinity. <br><br><h4>  How is gov2project planning to work? </h4><br><br><br>  We collect these projects in our virtual incubator: first, they need a single entry point, second, logical models of work that can be assessed only in several projects at once.  Many also require lobbying at the level of government, and for this they also need to create a system of monitoring and strategic communications for such projects. <br><br>  Today the scheme of work is as follows.  We are looking for and add to the <a href="http://gov2project.ru/blog/category/projects/list_project/">list of projects</a> all existing stories in Russia today.  And of course, we will be glad if you declare yourself and we will add you to our list.  Placing your project on the site implies not only involvement in the all-Russian Gov 2.0 movement, but also lobbying your interests at the state level and including Russian practices that can be presented internationally in the folder.  Moreover, we have connected a number of <a href="http://gov2project.ru/experts/">experts</a> from the industry who evaluate and comment on each case.  On the day of writing this article, more than 30 projects have been collected on Gov2Project.  View the full list <a href="http://gov2project.ru/blog/category/projects/list_project/">here</a> <br><br>  Moreover, we are planning a number of offline activities to promote participating projects and attract new developers.  The plans include filling in a new <a href="http://gov2project.ru/blog/category/mobile_apps/">section for mobile applications</a> and stories of ‚Äúcopicats‚Äù, which is understandable. <br><br>  In general, the site operates according to the scheme of the incubator.  We do not just collect information about projects, we help to find financing, choose an adequate business model, create an affiliate network, bring the project to the international market (if the project is really breakthrough and solves the problem existing in the external market). <br><br>  We ourselves do and do network projects.  We want to create an environment working rules.  We ourselves were engaged in fundraising for our projects and we understand that in Russia it‚Äôs ***, and where it‚Äôsn‚Äôt complete ***.  We want, in fact, to move from words to action.  And everything depends not only on us, but also on you.  Therefore, often knocking out texts of hundreds of calls to you, I find it strange.  You yourself are evangelicals of your projects.  We create simple tools, using which we can all together make constructive startups. <br><br><h4>  How can the media help? </h4><br><br>  One of our tasks we set the promotion and popularization of all projects of the participants.  Because often projects need not so much financial assistance as support and volunteers, who can be found by maximizing the usefulness and importance of the work of each of the projects. <br><br>  In addition, we are launching a <a href="http://gov2project.ru/blog/category/gov20_news/">special project for the media</a> and we will publish digests of the latest news on the development of civilian cases in Russia.  The project has a separate rubric in which we talk about the world's most successful case studies and practices, publish video interviews with the creators of the best projects, and release a <a href="http://gov2project.ru/blog/category/digest_media/">global digest.</a> <br><br><h4>  Upcoming Initiative - Code For Russia <br></h4><br><br>  We analyzed the logic of gov2.0 development of projects on the market and the attitude of government officials to these projects.  Therefore, the experience of our foreign colleagues seemed more than appropriate to us.  But even they do not have the mad popularity of this program.  Therefore, we changed the mechanics taking into account the Runet and conditions in the Russian Federation.  And we are glad to announce that soon we will launch CodeForRussia - an initiative.  Now we have pilot regions in which pilot series of the program are launched. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119145/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119145/</a></p>
