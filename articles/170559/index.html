      Under the cut waiting for you: <br>  - history reference <br>  - geek porn in large quantities (traffic) <br>  - the long-awaited vote about watches <br>  - and many letters! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  History reference </h4><br><br>  So, historically, wristwatches appeared in the 17th century, and of course for a long time remained a completely mechanical device.  Interestingly, the very first personalized watches were worn around the neck, like a pendant, and were intended primarily for decoration - the mechanisms were not lousy, they had to be worn at least twice a day, and there was only one hand, the watch. <br><br>  With the advent of waistcoats, the mods switched from pendant watches to pocket watches, the chain from which pathetically exhibited parade. <br><br>  By the 19th century, watchmakers got the knack of making fairly accurate mechanisms, took into account compensation for thermal expansion, and introduced other tricks to improve the accuracy of watches - so-called appeared.  chronometers, that is, the clock as a device for accurate measurement of time. <br><br>  By the end of the 19th century, with the advent of industrial production, watches were also made on a large scale.  At the same time, the company Patek Philippe, known to this day, produced the first wristwatches. <br><br>  It is interesting that although most of the watches were analog, innovations in the form of digital mechanical watches sometimes appeared - for example, the Cort√©bert Jumphour as early as 1890.  But such a watch was a rather funny trinket. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1f4/96d/631/1f496d631f9962cc117bfd52259da41c.jpg"><br><br>  And long hours were hours.  They could measure the phases of the moon, the calendar and other cyclic processes, but they were all mechanical, and they all mainly served to measure time (and the owner‚Äôs wallet thickness, of course). <br><br><h5>  Electric clock. </h5><br><br>  In 1957, the first clock on the battery appeared.  Not yet quartz, just instead of the clockwork spring, the mechanism moved at the expense of electricity.  But it was also a prelude. <br><br><h5>  Quartz watches </h5><br><br>  A revolution occurred in the late 1960s, when the well-known company Seiko released the world's first quartz watch, Seiko Quartz-Astron.  It was already a completely new technology, this watch was much more accurate than the previous electric, more precisely the majority of mechanical, much easier than them - and yet they did not need to be wound up. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/498/034/1fe/4980341fedc470d2a1ce134ce23eab14.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/81c/b8b/142/81cb8b1426575449471548478f0ed008.jpg"><br><br>  However, the second revolution was connected precisely with the digital clock - in the era of the birth of computers, the first digital watches appeared. <br><br><h5>  Digital watch </h5><br><br>  In the early 1970s, independent inventor Roger Reyle made and put into production a unique watch with a LED-display that was charged by solar panels - a double innovation!  They were called Synchronar. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1b1/b70/bfd/1b1b70bfd678e3f7d03fc5c97e3a5b0f.jpg"><br><br>  The inventor set out to make an absolutely impenetrable clock without moving parts inside.  Digital means without arrows.  Electronic means without gears.  Solar batteries - no need to change the battery.  Inside the case all the parts were filled with plastic, and the adjustment and control were carried out using magnetic buttons. <br><br>  Watches for their time looked like a fantastic gadget, besides the dial was on the side, which was also non-standard. <br><br>  Hot on the heels of the company Pulsar also in the early 1970s released a watch Pulsar P-1 with LED-display <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e44/6db/b39/e446dbb39de01307cdceb3a29819689f.jpeg"><br><br>  Like any new product, this one was expensive, and Pulsar decided to make a status accessory - an 18-carat gold case, and everything else.  Therefore, these watches cost their first happy owners $ 2'100.  No, do not rush to be surprised - at current prices, given the inflation of the dollar over 40 years, it will be about $ 12,000.  Here, now be surprised. <br>  It seems that today, when there are a few dozen copies left, they should be worth even more. <br>  Modelka Pulsar P2s came out a little later, cost a little less and lit up in the series ‚ÄúLive and let die‚Äù. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3a7/50d/e1d/3a750de1d191f1541d0a70e4b8b0d0ed.jpg"><br><br>  But the company, as is clear today, made a fairly common mistake - it relied on the exclusivity of the new technology, and did not take into account that technologies are rapidly improving and becoming cheaper. <br><br>  And, of course, the music did not last long - in 1975, again, the well-known company Texas Instruments released a massive inexpensive watch with LED displays and in plastic cases for only $ 20 (and a year later they were already sold at retail for $ 10).  Naturally, the company Pulsar went bankrupt and the brand bought Seiko. <br><br>  I think I already found such a clock in early childhood.  LED devoured energy, so you had to press a button to find out the time, but at the same time these little red lights looked absolutely magical. <br><br>  Around the same time, the first liquid crystal displays shook the market.  Seiko released its first watch Seiko 06 LC in 1973. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0f2/a95/b53/0f2a95b5325abab35a966eaea61afb16.jpg"><br><br>  I also remember these first-generation LCDs, the marsh color with a disgusting contrast - but also a miracle of technology, nothing can be said.  And the energy they spent was incomparably less than LED, so they very quickly drove those out of the market. <br><br><h5>  Gadgets </h5><br><br>  But in the mid-1980s, apparently, the third revolution happened - the clock began to gradually turn into gadgets.  Superiority captured Casio. <br><br>  1982 - Seiko T001 - the first watch with built-in TV <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1c7/433/cd7/1c7433cd775622eacb7f2e78db35e8d5.jpg"><br><br>  At the same time - Casio - clock with thermometer and translator from Japanese to English <br><br>  1985 - Casio CFX-400 with a calculator <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/933/1cd/0ff/9331cd0ff38189fdd43556c427fe9b44.jpg"><br><br>  1987 - Casio watch with dialing a phone number (more information could not be found - I suppose they made touch-tone sounds and had to be brought to the handset) <br><br>  Also this year, the first widely sold watch powered by the Casio AL-180 solar panels. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c5e/885/fdd/c5e885fdd97b4bccdbad09f8eed56c62.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, everyone remembers Casio watches with music alarms ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fb8/6fa/f65/fb86faf6541b68bd5c314c344aead739.jpeg"><br><br>  ... their Soviet counterparts "Electronics" <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/49d/39d/bd8/49d39dbd8c6cf32ce1042501dec641ab.jpg"><br><br>  ... as well as the hit of the 80s, the no-name Montana watch: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0ae/2a9/456/0ae2a945650ec157f350bfaa4418a484.png"><br><br>  And, thanks to <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/ve1m/" class="user_link">ve1m</a> , a link to the <a href="http://gleero.com/all/melodii-montany/">detailed description of</a> the Montana tunes with listening was found. <br><br>  In 1990, the German company Junghans Uhren GmbH released the world's first clock that tuned to radio signals, coded and broadcast in a special way - Junghans MEGA 1. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d94/fca/915/d94fca9157d4335aae08f4359367c1c1.jpg"><br><br>  1991 - Casio watch with a notebook, calculator, and - pa-ba-ba-bam!  - touch screen!  I do not know how it was possible to get a finger in such a small screen. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/789/e45/689/789e45689deaca05a5a837e4c55b3628.jpg"><br><br>  2000 - the first wristwatch with a Casio mp3 player <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c78/a21/c5e/c78a21c5e6987fa07006a58e229c1eec.jpg"><br><br>  By this time, technology has reached such a state that all sorts of unusual clocks fell like frogs after a hurricane. <br><br>  I will try to select categories from them. <br><br><h6>  Watches with different players. </h6><br><br>  <a href="http://www.prlog.org/10135205-mp4-player-watch-gadget-now-available-wholesale-direct-from-china.html">MP4 Player Watches</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f4e/756/66e/f4e75666eb4f7c5e6a7a72325a27b121.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.gizmowatch.com/entry/thanko-wrist-watch-is-mp4-player-with-a-video-camera/">Thanko with MP4 player and mini video camera</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/28a/5a5/9ce/28a5a59ce49296439362624a7602c646.jpg"><br><br><h6>  Clock with calculators and other devices </h6><br><br>  <a href="http://www.mintgadgets.com/watch-gadgets/watch-or-calculator/">Cal-q-tek</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9db/349/f7e/9db349f7ecf311d72f67efb72afaa579.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.uniquewatchguide.com/calculator-watch/">Casio CMD40B-1Z</a> <br>  Built-in calculator and remote control for the TV. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/702/802/896/70280289656e7d3052f43c3718847767.jpg"><br><br>  Already practically ancient hours with Palm OS -
