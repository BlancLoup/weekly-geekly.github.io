Why no sales?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good afternoon friends! <br><br>  Just the other day I came across a topic of one entrepreneur, more precisely an entrepreneur. <br>  She lamented the fact that last year she created an i-shop, but there is still no sales. <br>  And the store sells bed linen and other textiles category Luxury. <br><br>  I came in, I liked the site as a whole from the point of view of an inexperienced user, everything is simple and clear.  It would seem that‚Ä¶ <br>  But why no sales?

      The first thing that 99% killed my desire to buy something there is <a name="habracut"></a>  prepayment, 0.5% added, which is also the money.  It looks like a divorce, is not it? <br>  The supposed Central Shop of the Store lives in St. Petersburg and Moscow, but the entrepreneur is honest and has indicated Saratov in the contact details.  Plus to the negative. <br>  The phone was listed mobile, then replaced with a phone with code 499. For the luxury segment?  Here I would have been 100% sure that this was a divorce and would never have returned to this store, even if it was the last person to sell textiles. <br>  A store that positions itself as a supplier of luxury products should itself be a luxury, without obvious attempts to save money. <br><br>  I close my eyes to the above, I look further.  Discounts!  Old price <s>1250r</s> new 1250r.  Smiled.  If there is a jamb, then it means where else it can crawl out, for example, in delivery terms, in quality, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/29d/0eb/a05/29d0eba050214e8e978cf3aa4bf25f68.jpg"><br><br>  Delivery 500r.  The logic was probably simple, if people buy a pillow case for 8yrs, what is the load for them in 500r?  In this case, it does not work.  Rather, it will work like this: people are not poor, if they like something, they can‚Äôt climb different sites, look for the same thing, but they won‚Äôt be cheaper, they will buy this pillow case for 8 and 8.5 <br><br>  Looking ahead, I still did not find a reason for myself to buy something in this e-store, if absolutely necessary. <br><br>  Summarize: <br>  1. A luxury shop should be attentive to trifles, if there are discounts, then ‚Äúhonest‚Äù, if the texts, then no spelling mistakes, etc. <br>  2. No prepayment.  Work with suppliers, let them accept a free refund.  And if you suddenly become quite impatient - make it possible to pay with a credit card, and not with money, kiwi, etc., but it‚Äôs better to close right away. <br>  3. Contacts.  If you sell in the province, indicate the contacts of your region.  If you sell in megalopolises, but live in another place, indicate the contacts of the megalopolis.  Now there are services that "substitute" the phone of the region from which the buyer comes.  Create the feeling that you are near.  The address can not specify at all, if you do not have a warehouse = Pickup.  Phone - no 499. Everyone knows that it is cheaper for a penny than 495. If Moscow time and if luxury, then only 495 <br>  4. Delivery should be average for the region.  For Moscow time and Peter this 250-300r.  Do not think that people with wealth are fools and will be ready to overpay for obvious things.  And it is better to hide it in the price of goods, thereby trump free shipping.  The buyer will consider this a nice bonus = an extra plus to recommend and return for a ‚Äúduvet cover‚Äù. <br><br>  About ways to promote, website design, etc.  I do not write.  Surely "themselves with a mustache." <br>  Thank you for attention. <br><br>  gzh </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293134/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293134/</a></p>
