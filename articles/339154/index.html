  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Motivated installations from the USA (Android) - review of options, statistics, opinion</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Preface:</b> I am the most common individual developer of Android applications, I have already published one of my creations quite a while on Google Play, after which I worked hard on it.  At some point, I decided - "Why not try to promote the application?".  For this, I began to diligently read various literature on this subject.  Later came the idea to try to buy a motivated installation (about what it read below).  It was decided to move specifically in the United States.  Actually further - the fact that I got that I tried. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Chapter 1. Motivated installations </h3><br>  <u>Motivated installations</u> - ordered installation of your application by other users in order to increase positions in the category. <br><br>  It's not a secret for anyone - the more people download an application, the higher it will be when viewed in a category.  The ideal is to achieve 1-3 places, because they account for the largest part of installations and views (almost no one will scroll through the list of categories up to 300 applications). <br><br>  This method is intended for "artificial" promotion of a position in a category.  For this to happen, judging by various sources, you need to get as many installations as possible in 2-3 days for Google Play, I don‚Äôt know how Apple is doing, so I won‚Äôt lie. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      In this way, alongside the obvious advantages, there are also disadvantages.  After entering the top category, if the application is not massive, it can just as easily fly out from there, so you need to choose this method wisely. <br><br><h3>  Chapter 2. Where to get them and why the USA? </h3><br>  Why did I choose the United States - everything is simple, I, like any other person, want to earn money to eat.  Therefore, I immediately dismissed Russia, income is coming from it, but its quality is several times worse than that of the United States, because we don‚Äôt like to part with money and pay very little for advertising. <br><br>  If we consider Russia for motivated installations, then it is worthwhile to drive into Google the ‚ÄúMotivated Android installations‚Äù, as you will immediately receive a whole bunch of options.  But the problem is that almost none of the companies I turned to from this list provide services of motivated installations from other countries, or they offer it - but this is done through partners and, accordingly, the price is quite large. <br><br>  Then I decided to go deep and find companies that are focused on installations from the United States, but this was not so easy, I spent a lot of time looking for suitable and relatively cheap options.  Next, I provide a list of those that I chose for my application: <br><br><ol><li>  <a href="http://www.waypedia.com/">www.waypedia.com</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.cpimobi.com/">www.cpimobi.com</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.keyapp.top/">www.keyapp.top</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.mopeak.com/">www.mopeak.com</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.cpidroid.com/">www.cpidroid.com</a> </li></ol><br>  I‚Äôll say right away that some of them offer installations not only from the United States, but also from other countries, but I‚Äôm talking about my experience with the United States. <br><br><h3>  Chapter 3. Objectives, budget, timeline </h3><br>  The main goal that I set myself to get more than 10,000 units in 3 days.  Ideally, I wanted 20k, but as it turned out, these companies cannot offer such volumes for such a short period. <br><br>  As a rule, such networks are based on the fact that they have an application that allows ordinary users to earn money by installing other applications (ours) and dialing a huge number of users who are ready to install in one country - it can be very difficult. <br><br>  Next, I give a table of how much installations have been promised to me, how much money this required, and so on.  <u>They promised</u> - I contacted the managers of each company and asked them for this information. <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Company name </th><th>  Installations for 1 day </th><th>  Installations for 3 day </th><th>  Cost of 1 installation </th><th>  total cost </th></tr><tr><td>  waypedia.com </td><td>  200 </td><td>  600 </td><td>  $ 0.1 </td><td>  60 $ </td></tr><tr><td>  cpimobi.com </td><td>  200 </td><td>  600 </td><td>  $ 0.083 </td><td>  $ 50 </td></tr><tr><td>  cpimobi.com </td><td>  2000 </td><td>  6000 </td><td>  0.09 $ </td><td>  $ 540 </td></tr><tr><td>  mopeak.com </td><td>  ~ 260 </td><td>  800 </td><td>  0,121 $ </td><td>  $ 95 </td></tr><tr><td>  cpidroid.com </td><td>  600 </td><td>  1800 </td><td>  0,222 $ </td><td>  $ 400 </td></tr></tbody></table><br><h4>  Chapter 4. Process </h4><br>  Next, I will tell you a little about each of the company and how their promises were true. <br><br>  All companies were launched on Friday evening (09/22/2017) and by the evening of Monday the results were expected. <br><br>  <b>waypedia.com</b> <br>  I failed to cope with my promises; I provide a screenshot of their installation statistics. <br>  In the end, I got about 100 installations in just 3 days.  Extremely disappointed. <br><br><img src="https://image.ibb.co/fCycm5/1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>cpimobi.com</b> <br>  I failed to cope with my promises; I provide a screenshot of their installation statistics. <br>  As a result, I received 4 installations in 3 days, however, as seen on the schedule, the number of installations increased greatly on days 4 and 5, perhaps this is due to the day of the week, as the installations were planned for the weekend and maybe people prefer to do other things at this time. <br><br><img src="https://image.ibb.co/iXuuYk/2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>keyapp.top</b> <br>  We were most pleased, of the 6000 units promised, we coped with almost everyone, and I also cite statistics.  Plus, when paying, I received a bonus in the form of additional installations, which I also used. <br><br><img src="https://image.ibb.co/cDJD9Q/3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>mopeak.com</b> <br>  These gentlemen do not have a control panel, you just buy one of the packages offered on their website and if you want the installations to be from a particular country - you need to contact the managers and inform them about it, which I did on Friday, to which I was told ‚Äú Ok. <br>  However, after the weekend they wrote to me in the mail, they say, at the moment you are installing around the world, you just want to cut them to the United States.  To which I, of course, was very indignant, because  they promised me on Friday that everything was OK. <br><br>  In general, I strongly advise against contacting them, but this is my personal opinion.  They refused to provide any data on installation statistics. <br><br>  <b>cpidroid.com</b> <br>  They could not fulfill their promise, but they kept the level of downloads quite large for the first three days.  Screenshot of statistics is attached.  However, after 3 days the number of installations per day has greatly decreased, as a result, so far I received only half of the promised installations. <br><br><img src="https://image.ibb.co/iPhJb5/4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Chapter 5. Summing up </h4><br>  Well, it's time to take stock.  As for sites for buying motivated installations, you can use keyapp.top, cpidroid.com and cpimobi.com (if you understand how many installations per day depend on).  The remaining two, I would not advise you to choose if you have a need for a short time to get the maximum number of installations. <br><br>  <b>What Google Play Statistics Says</b> <br>  Unfortunately, it is impossible to determine exactly from which site how many people installed it (although there were options on a couple of sites with the ability to insert a link with UTM and track the settings, but I did not bother with this).  However, you can see how many installations dripped in ~ 3 days - about 6,000 installations + in the coming days, installations from some sites will still go, but how much sense this will be - I'm not sure. <br><br><img src="https://image.ibb.co/jkdKik/5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>What did that change for me</b> <br>  So far it is difficult to talk about the full advantage that this method has given me.  However, according to the <a href="http://www.appbrain.com/">www.appbrain.com</a> site <a href="http://www.appbrain.com/">, the</a> position of my application in the USA in the Work category has risen from the ‚Äúbottom‚Äù to 241 places. <br><br>  I can only hope that the results of my investment will pay off for me and the application will take at least one of the TOP-10 places in the category. <br><br>  There are doubts that I have not analyzed the market of platforms enough or invested little money to achieve this goal, but nothing can be done, bad experience is also an experience. <br>  And I am glad to share it with you, I look forward to your comments and feedback, I hope my efforts on the article were not wasted. <br><br>  PS Now I'm interested in the topic of promotion on key phrases, perhaps in the future I will publish another article on this issue. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/339154/">https://habr.com/ru/post/339154/</a></p>
