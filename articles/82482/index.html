  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Think Different" sample 2010</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>Friends, before you look under the cat, I want to warn you about something.</i> <br><br>  <b>This is another post on Habr√© about the iPad.</b>  But a post in a personal blog.  Let's respect this concept.  I don‚Äôt go home (where the iPad is already hated), I don‚Äôt publish this post on the Apple blog or the fresh iPad blog.  I publish it in a personal blog on Habr√©.  Just to pour out my thoughts, and arguably arguably argued, but not to cholivar.  If you don‚Äôt want to hear more about the iPad, don‚Äôt go under the cat.  There is a lot of text. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The day did not write anything about the freshly eager iPad.  Friends who consider me a macophile even began to be surprised.  This is still not an ordinary update of the iMac line, but the release of a completely new Apple device.  Yes, I could not write about him, but I needed time to think about everything. <br><br>  Honestly, I was a little embarrassed by the release of this device.  That is, yes, everyone was waiting for him, everyone was talking about him, everyone was predicting his exit, but as someone said, ‚Äú <i>everyone was waiting for a small MacBook, but they got a big iPod</i> ‚Äù.  Yes it is.  And the main reason for my embarrassment was the lack of a full-fledged operating system, because I was expecting that I could safely sell my MacBook and buy an iPad as a full-fledged replacement.  It was not there.

      The presentation ended, there was a standing ovation, but I could not answer the question ‚ÄúI want‚Äù or ‚ÄúI do not want‚Äù.  In the words of those who negatively unsubscribed about the new device on Twitter and on Habr√© was really the point.  No multitasking, no USB, no memory expansion, no WiMax, dubious convenience of the form factor, and so on.  But wait, did Apple ever disappoint us?  That thought was spinning in my head. <br><br><h4>  A little "water" </h4><br>  Recall the distant, now, 2007, the year of release of the iPhone.  The presentation died down, the attention of journalists, the enthusiastic shouts of applefiles and reality came.  What shit the iPhone wasn‚Äôt compared to.  ‚ÄúForwards‚Äù in this war were the following reasons: lack of bluetooth, lack of MMS, lack of support for JAVA (now it‚Äôs even funny), a non-removable battery, and so on.  I have been using an iPhone for almost two years, and damn, well, I have never been harmed by these disadvantages, although at that time they seemed to be a rather serious omission of Apple.  And no, it's not about my macophilia - there is almost no trace left of her.  In short, I never had the desire to accept or transmit something via Bluetooth (Shazam rules, if you know what I mean), MMS was implemented as a third-party application (and in firmware 3.0 it is known by default, although I do not use anyway I consider this pribluda superfluous), I can not imagine a single situation in which I would have to change the battery.  About JAVA silent, right?  And recently, with @ <a href="http://twitter.com/Mike_Pedalkin">Mike_Pedalkin</a> ( <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/dvorik/" class="user_link">DvoRik</a> ), we laughed at the fact that in 2005 we chose the phone on the principle ‚Äúfor ICQ and the Internet, something from Nokia or SE‚Äù, and in 2010 on the principle ‚Äútake 3GS now or wait for 4G?‚Äù.  Questions with a choice of phone have disappeared from me, and probably for a long time. <br><br>  The fact is that we are accustomed to being all in one, ‚Äúno, well, what if it comes in handy?‚Äù.  And this is an incomprehensible aspiration, under the guidance of the thought ‚Äúsince I am paying so much money, I want an iron, microwave and dildo / artificial vagina in my phone, please‚Äù.  How about narrow-mindedness?  We are not used to this, huh? <br><br><h4>  iPad - device focused </h4><br>  It <i>should not be a full-fledged computer</i> .  <b>Not due</b> .  Even multitaskov not be.  Convenient surfing (and even with such a smart screen, it will not just be convenient), convenient video viewing, convenient notebook + scheduler.  Everything!  That's all that a netbook / tablet should be able to do.  And the Apple iPad meets these needs. <br><br><h4>  Potential is a key feature of all Apple products. </h4><br>  And here we are moving smoothly to the essence of my sheets - the potential of the new device.  When Steve announced the capabilities of the iPad, among all the others was the ‚Äú30-pin connector‚Äù.  And everyone in the hall issued a profound "Mmm ...", without understanding anything at the same time.  Only then it turned out that this is a standard "charging" connector, like on an iPhone or iPod.  Nothing new, huh?  And now again flashback in the past, now half a year ago, to the presentation of the iPhone 3GS (if my memory serves me).  Remember how a long-haired man came up onto the stage and demonstrated that the iPhone, only with an adapter, turns into a guitar effects library?  Then it seemed to me the most stupid application of the iPhone.  And if you think about it now, in the light of the iPad?  We connect to the iPad camera, and manage the shooting process.  We connect the speakers and in our hands we have a virtual DJ mixer.  We connect any musical instrument, and the iPad becomes a library of effects to it.  How many more uses can he find?  Just with the appropriate application, the iPad becomes ... yes, anything.  And yes, here, I contradict my theory about the device‚Äôs narrow focus, but it‚Äôs just thoughts out loud about the iPad‚Äôs potential. <br><br>  I just looked at the main, as it seemed to me the lack of iPad from a different angle.  Everything that the iPhone can do (and more recently it even reads credit cards) is now on the big screen iPad! <br><br>  All that I have already rolled too much.  Probably so used to Twitter and 140 characters, and so missed the unlimited blog posts ... I hit it off in general :) I just wanted to say that Apple has not yet "pleased" us with the release of goofy devices.  They were always different.  And they always changed the world.  As a result, they remained true to their main slogan - ‚ÄúThink Different!‚Äù. <br><br>  PS I'll buy an iPad at the first opportunity. <br><br>  PPS I forgot to write what I wanted to start with - it turns out Apple is releasing adapters for USB and memory cards as additional equipment.  Feel what I'm getting at? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/82482/">https://habr.com/ru/post/82482/</a></p>
