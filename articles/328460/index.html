If you have not heard, then the largest technology conference Build 2017 is held in Seattle. We have already published news from the key report of the first day, the time has come for a new portion - under the cut you are waiting for virtual and mixed reality, cross-platform (and we are not just about Xamarin) , new features of Windows Creators Update and Design! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/2f0/251/891/2f02518915af4bcc98379edb96b19150.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  How much time today was devoted to design in its various variations!  Joe Belfiore - vice-president Microsoft shared a new concept for creating applications, which the company will now be guided to design not only its operating system, but also to create a unified and comprehensive approach to user interaction beyond any platform and device. <br><br>  From now on - <b>only the user and his tasks are central to any system and application</b> .  Microsoft encourages developers to take advantage of the opportunities presented and create not just applications, but full-fledged stories, continuous processes around the end user, not limited to the operating system, platform, or application type.  Let any work begin on the PC, continue on the iPhone, be edited on the Mac, and demonstrated in Surface Studio, while the user of your solution does not even notice switching between different systems, staying in context and concentrating only on his goal, solving the problem.

      Here it is time to talk about the first and most important today announcement of the whole concept, behind which stand the new features of the Windows Creators Update operating system - the Microsoft Fluent Design System.  <a href="http://fluent.microsoft.com/">Fluent Design System</a> will allow developers to create applications that work on different devices and use a variety of ways to interact with the user, namely data entry. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/vcBGj4R7Fo0%3Fecver%3D1&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh8qO0gcFV9EYU5tNVWTwA4nQrFPg"></iframe><br><br>  Fluent Design System is based on five key elements: light, depth, motion, material and scale.  Regarding these principles, Microsoft is exploring a variety of ways for a user to interact with a system that goes beyond our usual mouse, keyboard, touch screen, or pen.  For example, using your voice or even your gaze to work with applications, especially in mixed or augmented reality scenarios.  When all these elements are combined, the end result is software and user interaction scripts that go far beyond the computer or any other device screen. <br><br>  With Microsoft Graph, new meaning is acquired and the synchronization of work in your applications on various devices.  Now we are really talking about all devices - Windows, iOS and Android. <br><br>  Microsoft Graph is a system that allows you to connect people, their relationships, conversations, projects and content within the Microsoft cloud.  The capabilities of this system allow applications to work equally on any devices running Windows, iOS and Android: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Timeline</b> - the timeline that displays what the user was doing earlier.  The technology at the heart of it will allow you to return to previously open files, applications and sites.  With the help of Cortan, you can continue to work from the place where you interrupted it (the Pick Up Where You Left Off function) on any devices. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Clipboard</b> is a fast and easy way to share any information between synchronized devices.  For example, you can copy a file on your computer, and save or paste on a smartphone. <br><br></li><li>  <b>OneDrive Files on Demand</b> - access to all files in the cloud on OneDrive on request.  Download all files and take up memory on your devices is not required.  In addition, Microsoft has simplified the installation of Ubuntu by publishing the operating system in the Windows Store.  SUSE and Fedora are also in the process of being published to the Windows Store.  This means that you can run Ubuntu, Fedora and SUSE on the Linux subsystem in Windows by simply installing them from the Windows Store. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7dd/883/d65/7dd883d6557f4a54af3081f9ce7f72e9.png"><br><br>  Windows 10 Fall Creators Update will allow users all over the world to touch the magic created by mixed reality.  The corporation actively cooperates with various development companies in this innovative field, and strives to ensure that each of them has access to a set of tools for developing applications using Microsoft mixed reality technologies. <br><br>  In this direction, Microsoft introduced the world's first Windows Mixed Reality motion controllers, which do not require additional markers.  Motion controllers will be able to accurately track the movement in your field of view using sensors that are built into a mixed reality helmet.  Installation of other devices on the walls or in the room is not required. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/1nlcdDNOdm8%3Fecver%3D1&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgz9o2qKHyZvMWHkb9HGGvMPCXTqg"></iframe><br><br><h2>  Development of development tools and platforms </h2><br>  Microsoft continues to develop its tools, guided by a simple idea - any developer should be able to create almost any solution using the company's technology, regardless of preferences regarding the language, platform or type of application. <br><br>  Thanks to this idea, we finally got full versions of VS for Mac, Xamarin and more. <br><br>  But Microsoft is also striving to make Windows and Visual Studio a complete and complete set of tools for developing any solutions.  Today we announced a number of new tools for developers who chose Windows as their operating system for working and creating their own applications. <br><br>  The company introduced a new technology standard that simplifies the creation of applications for various frameworks.  We are talking about XAML Standard - a set of standards that are an attempt to unify the various XAML dialects for the platforms that use them, such as UWP and Xamarin Forms: <br><br><ul><li>  XAML Standard is a specification that defines the standard XAML markup vocabulary. </li><li>  Frameworks that support XAML Standard can use common user interfaces created in XAML. </li><li>  The release of the first version is scheduled for the end of this year and will include support for XAML Standard in Xamarin Forms and UWP. </li></ul><br>  XAML Standard develops as an open source project that is available in the repository on <a href="http://aka.ms/xamlstandard">GitHub</a> . <br><br>  Go ahead and tell about the announcements in the framework of the new features of Visual Studio and the .NET platform, which became available to developers in the preview: <br><br>  <b>Xamarin Live Player</b> - allows you to deploy iOS-created applications directly to your iPhone or another iDevice device directly from Visual Studio on Windows, where this code can then be tested and debugged.  This means that you can not use a Mac at this stage of development.  However, Mac is still required for the final assembly and publication of the application on the App Store, so developers can't do without the Apple operating system.  Live Player also supports Android. <br><br>  <b>The release of the Project Rome SDK for iOS</b> .  Initially, Project Rome is a set of APIs for various platforms that allow an application on one device to interact with applications and services on other PCs or devices.  The very features that allow developers to create cross-platform scripts, centered around tasks and user, not limited to the framework of platforms. <br><br>  <b>As well as .NET Standard 2.0 for UWP</b> . <br><br>  But not only the creation of solutions worries engineers Microsoft.  Building, deploying, testing, providing a beta version, publishing, even team work are all processes that are easily combined into one continuous cycle and packaged in a capacious word DevOps. <br><br>  Last year, a single platform was announced, created to provide all the necessary processes for creating mobile applications - Visual Studio Mobile Center. <br><br>  The service is now in Preview and Microsoft continues to work on it, adding new features almost every week.  And today was not without announcements: <br><br><ul><li>  Announced support for Universal Windows Platform applications! </li><li>  The list of popular source control systems has expanded to integrate with them - GitHub, Bitbucket, and VSTS. </li><li>  Developers can now use the popular testing frameworks, Espresso and XCUITest, to automatically test applications on real devices provided within the Mobile Center, as well as send alerts to the beta testing team as soon as a new version or application build becomes available. </li><li>  Additionally, services have been added to better interact with the target audience, thanks to segmented notifications based on geography, activity, or other user characteristics. </li></ul><br>  But the Visual Studio Mobile Center updates are not completed with today's announcements, the tool continues to acquire new functionality that can be expected in the coming months. <br><br>  Read more about the announcements of the second day of the Build 2017 conference, you can read in the <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/05/11/build-2017-sparking-the-next-wave-of-creativity-with-the-windows-10-fall-creators-update/">official blog of Terry Myerson</a> . <br><br><h2>  follow the news </h2><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/microsoft/blog/328014/">Text translation of the first day of the conference</a> . </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/microsoft/blog/328366/">Text translation of the second day of the conference</a> . </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/microsoft/blog/328378/">Key announcements of the first day of the conference</a> . </li><li>  News in official social networks of Microsoft Developer: <a href="https://vk.com/msdnru">VK</a> , <a href="https://www.facebook.com/msdnru/">Facebook</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/msdevru">Twitter</a> , <a href="https://t.me/msdnru">Telegram</a> . </li><li>  <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/%3Fwt.mc_id%3Dbuild_hp">English translation of 10, 11 and 12 May + recordings after the live broadcast</a> . </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/328460/">https://habr.com/ru/post/328460/</a></p>
