Some children do it without any problems, but most are still happy to shirk if there is such an opportunity.  The reason is mainly that children are bored with brushing their teeth - this is a routine, and its younger generation does not like adults more.  Even if a child brushes his teeth, he can do it poorly, formally, and after all, an adult does not always have time to observe how the child performs this ‚Äúwork‚Äù. <br><br>  Modern technologies, as always, come to the rescue.  Not so long ago, the Grush toothbrush appeared, which turns toothbrushing into a game.  And in this game, the one who brushed his teeth perfectly gets the maximum reward. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/JsZ-M6tZviw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgYnNPxsOG2UKBBMUYTbw_kLSbgtw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

    <h3>  main idea </h3><br>  Children, even very diligent and obedient, are unlikely to brush their teeth all the time, as expected - passing on the outer and inner surfaces of the teeth, making translational movements, and spending 2 minutes for this whole procedure, as recommended by the doctors.  Most kids relate to brushing their teeth as a formality, with all the consequences.  Basically, this means touching the front teeth with a toothbrush and, or, at best, cleaning the outside of the teeth. <br><br>  After that, the child puts the brush in place and, with a sense of accomplishment, goes to tell mom and dad that everything has been done. <br><br>  <b>And how to brush your teeth?</b> <br><br>  It is necessary to brush your teeth at least twice a day: 1 - in the morning;  2 - before bedtime, after the last meal / liquid intake (except for water). <br><ul><li>  Before cleaning the toothbrush must be washed. </li><li>  A small amount of paste is applied on the brush (not more than 0.5 cm for children and not more than 1 cm for adults). </li><li>  Position the toothbrush head at a 45 degree angle to the gum line.  Make short circular motions from the gum to the cutting edge.  Clean each tooth thoroughly. </li><li>  Cleaning the inner surface of each tooth by moving from the gum to the tooth.  The brush is placed perpendicular to the cutting edges. </li><li>  The same movements clean the outer surfaces of the teeth. </li><li>  Move the chewing surfaces of the upper and lower molars by moving back and forth or in circles. </li><li>  Complete the cleaning with a massage of the gums - with the mouth closed with a brush, perform circular motions with the grip of the teeth and gums. </li><li>  Clean the tongue (special scrapers are made to clean the tongue, but you can restrict yourself with a toothbrush. Start cleaning the tongue from the back and gradually head towards the front surface). </li><li>  Wash the brush and bristle up into the glass. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/64d/c03/08f/64dc0308f403faf3da1daa1669cd17da.jpg" width="850"><br><br>  If the teeth are not brushed, they will deteriorate, as everyone knows.  But negative consequences can be caused by improper brushing of the teeth: ‚ÄúBecause of the wrong movements of the toothbrush (up and down, left-right or circular movements), the gums are injured, soft dental plaque is driven into the interdental spaces and in the gingival pockets, and the teeth in neck areas are grinded and a wedge-shaped defect forms. ‚Äù <br><br>  It is clear that teaching a child how to brush teeth is not so difficult, but few children will perform this procedure regularly.  And to constantly monitor the process of brushing your teeth with a child is hardly possible.  And here comes to the aid of a smart brush Grush (for children aged 3 years). <br><br><h3>  What is Grush? </h3><br>  It looks like a regular toothbrush.  But it has several sensors, a gyroscope and a Bluetooth wireless module.  When cleaning teeth, the sensor tracks the location of the brush, including the angle of inclination, and analyzes this information, showing the cleaning process on the screen of the paired phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ebc/6c0/060/ebc6c006062f491292dc43e94cf2e3a8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/27f/ecf/cc6/27fecfcc60f541caa72c3e960c20a22a.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, Grush is ‚ÄúGaming Toothbrush‚Äù, it's simple. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4f4/41b/025/4f441b025d336c4c59d24e8debfd158b.png"><br><br>  All decorated quite simple. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f28/c9d/181/f28c9d18105aa8f7b342a32e7896b096.gif"><br><br>  In principle, it is - Grush is a simple but very useful electronic device, linked to the cloud service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/350/0f3/0c8/3500f30c8eba2af2eac3c08f71632213.png"><br><br>  To get started, you need to install a special software, a mobile application on the phone, after which the brush and smartphone are paired (strangely as it may sound) in automatic mode.  Then you can choose one of several games available for use and start brushing your teeth.  Both iOS and Android are supported, by the way ( <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.grush.toothycastles">for children</a> and for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.grush.dashboard">parents</a> ).  The application will be Russified to the start of sales (this November). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/45f/fd6/45a/45ffd645ac674745a388d9ef2ff6be6f.jpg"><br><br>  All data that is transferred to the application is automatically saved in the cloud.  And access to the cloud service can also be obtained by parents who can already understand how well the teeth cleaning process is.  If you wish, you can reward particularly diligent children. <br><br><h3>  What does Grush give to a child? </h3><br>  <b>Games</b> <br><br>  Several game developers promise to release soon.  This, for example, such toys: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3f4/29f/4bf/3f429f4bf8d8882cdc2caa53f25f617e.gif"><br>  Grush Game II: Toothy Orchestra <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/47d/419/7f4/47d4197f4302da8403fd913467a0f1d6.gif"><br>  Grush Game III: Brush-a-pet <br><br>  There are several other games where the child will control the spacecraft or ride a pony. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c65/044/50d/c6504450dd4544abae33b21e9c980a14.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/181/603/d69/181603d6950e405eb7c283282213a920.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c3/b88/53b/4c3b8853bebe4527b6e2a6f68fc27a86.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/51d/65b/2d7/51d65b2d72b046a0bf83dfae23433537.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Book</b> <br><br>  The application has a section that details why it is so important to brush your teeth.  It also tells about the consequences of poor dental care - for example, how they will be treated if something happens. <br><br>  Plus, the developers have added an alarm clock, reminding that it's time to clean the teeth. <br><br><h3>  What gives grush to parents? </h3><br>  If you want to see how thoroughly your child brushes his teeth, you can install the appropriate application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/259/655/ec2/259655ec226bda9b494ee192df70e33a.png"><br><br>  In general, with such a brush it is unlikely that the child will refuse to brush the teeth, especially since the manufacturer promises to release new and new games.  But anything can happen. <br><br>  Actually, parents themselves can use such a brush.  And if driving a pony might not be very interesting, then visualization of teeth cleaning is great. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8fd/511/c34/8fd511c34f14479a8a889241bad442ee.jpg" height="550"><br><br><h3>  Where can I buy? </h3><br>  Now the brush is already for sale, and it can be purchased from the <a href="http://www.grushgamer.com/">manufacturer</a> , on the official website. <br><br>  In Russia, the device can be <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/grush-igrovaja-zubnaja-schetka-dlja-detej.html">purchased from Medgadgets</a> .
