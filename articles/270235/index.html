This is not an analogue of upWork (ex-oDesk), but rather, Uber: in the shortest time the service finds a programmer on a project that is suitable for location, language, competencies and cost. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/12b/c93/4ad/12bc934ad7ef45429d2a5dfe215033e5.jpg"><br><br>  The developers at the entrance to the system go through a very serious procedure of testing and confirming their professional experience: this way a community of top developers who prefer to work remotely and are open to new projects is formed on the basis of the service.  We make a product for programmers who can be trusted with key projects, as there are enough platforms for freelancers who perform small non-core tasks.

      Possessing extensive experience in the "selection" of developers, we systematized our knowledge and faced the challenge of an ideal programmer profile, truly convenient not only for us, but also for a wide audience. <br><br>  So‚Ä¶ <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It should be: <br>  a) reliable and informative for the employer <br>  b) Simple and easy to fill for the developer. <br><br>  Unlike offline recruitment, in our case the customer decides to invite the developer to the project, in fact, guided only by the information in his profile and our recommendation.  The service, for its part, guarantees <b>accuracy</b> (checks data on work places, projects and tasks, conducts deep testing of all skills, communication skills in the team of other developers, and confirms knowledge of foreign languages).  The structure of the profile we are working on is responsible for the <b>information</b> content.  At the same time, we do not in any way want to complicate and overload the profile: it should be such that it can be easily filled, quickly evaluated, and in the case of interest - to obtain the necessary additional information. <br><br>  We analyzed popular online forms.  They were not written for programmers, so, of course, they are good for their versatility, but our goals correspond little.  We took on the adaptation of the standard questionnaire for the specifics of the IT-industry and, in particular, programmers working remotely. <br><br>  In the end, we needed to include 4 main entities in the profile: <br><br>  1. Formal data.  There are usually two strict criteria that allow the customer and the contractor to work in a place: time (time zone) and language for working communication.  Therefore, the profile must include information on where the performer lives, what hours of work are suitable for him, what language is his mother tongue, and on which he knows how to communicate without any problems. <br><br>  2. Skills.  It should not be an excessive list of languages, platforms and technologies with which the performer has ever worked or read / heard about.  It is enough to choose those in which he considers himself an expert, and among them, those with whom he wants to continue working, and adjacent skills.  To display skills in the resume, we offer a structured form. <br><br>  3. Experience.  The most important section, which is very easy to spoil the lack or excess of information.  We propose to list the projects in which the developer took part, clarify the composition of the team and its role in it, and also describe what tasks he directly performed.  The most interesting projects can be described in more detail, the ordinary ones can only be mentioned. <br><br>  Thus, we move away from the standard listing of absolutely all the technologies that the developer touched or saw, and shift the focus on his direct role in the project and cases that seemed interesting to him (that is, we ask in advance to answer questions that the interviewer would ask job interview). <br><br>  4. Sample code.  The code is the product that the customer ultimately acquires from the programmer, therefore its quality and style are often the main criteria when choosing a performer.  In this regard, we consider it necessary to add a link to GitHub in the questionnaire or the opportunity to attach an archive with the code that the developer is ready to show as his portfolio. <br><br>  It is also possible to insert links to author articles on professional resources, as well as share information about basic and additional education, courses, trainings, and certificates received. <br><br>  At the moment we have managed to form such a structure, on which we continue to work: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ac/024/0f0/6ac0240f0d8444d6b19f5572ced8dd63.jpg"><br><br>  In order to make a really high-quality product, we need your help. <br>  What items need to add / expand / specify? <br><br>  Maybe some points seemed unnecessary to you? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/270235/">https://habr.com/ru/post/270235/</a></p>
