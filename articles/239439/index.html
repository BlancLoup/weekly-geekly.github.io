  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How an IT freelancer to become an entrepreneur. Part 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello!  In the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/iloveip/blog/237107/">previous post,</a> we told why the SP freelancer and why SP is better than LLC.  Today you will learn how to register individual entrepreneurs independently and what to do next. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ef/037/83c/5ef03783cdaa4268808d67884d91ad2c.jpg"><br><br>  <i>All for self-registration IP on the site " <a href="http://www.iloveip.ru/">I love IP</a> "</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  OKVED codes </h4><br>  First you need to determine the types of activities and select OKVED codes.  They are indicated in the IP registration application and must contain at least four numeric characters, for example, 72.20.  One code should be chosen as the main one, all the rest will be additional. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      <br>
      The following codes are suitable for freelancing in IT: <br><ul><li>  <i>Web and mobile application development</i> - 72.20 Software development and consulting in this area, </li><li>  <i>Web design and website development</i> - 72.60 Other activities related to the use of computers and information technology. </li></ul><br>  Additionally, you can specify: <br><ul><li>  72.10. Hardware consulting on hardware. </li><li>  72.30 Data processing </li><li>  72.40 Activities for the creation and use of databases and information resources </li><li>  72.50 Maintenance and repair of office machines and computing equipment. </li></ul><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Other OKVED codes do not belong to IT, but they can be useful.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  <i>Graphic design</i> - 74.84 Provision of other services </li><li>  <i>Online store</i> - 52.61.2 Retail trade, carried out through television stores and computer networks (electronic commerce, including the Internet), </li><li>  <i>Advertisement (SMM)</i> - 74.40 Advertising, </li><li>  <i>Trainings, master classes</i> - 80.42 Adult education and other types of education not included in other groups, </li><li>  <i>Marketing, PR</i> - 74.14 Advice on business and management, </li><li>  <i>Recruitment</i> - 74.50 Manpower and recruitment, </li><li>  <i>Translation services</i> - 74.83 Providing secretarial, editorial and translation services, </li><li>  <i>Copywriting</i> - 92.31.2 Activities in the field of artistic, literary and performing art. </li></ul></div></div><br>  The OKVED classifier is quite large, and you can see it completely on <a href="http://base.consultant.ru/cons/cgi/online.cgi%3Freq%3Ddoc%3Bbase%3DLAW%3Bn%3D167912%3Bdiv%3DLAW%3Bdst%3D116889,0%3Brnd%3D0.9441897759679705">Consultant Plus</a> website. <br><br><h4>  IP registration </h4><br>  You can apply for registration of IP through the Internet.  This is the easiest and fastest way, for this you need: <br><ul><li>  have TIN, </li><li>  personally receive the documents in the tax at the place of residence. </li></ul><br>  If you do not have a TIN or you live in another city, then you can go through the usual registration of IP. <br><br>  <strong>IP registration via the Internet</strong> <br><br>  To apply, go to the website of the <a href="https://service.nalog.ru/zgreg/zayav-new.html%3Fkind%3Dip">Federal Tax Service of Russia</a> .  Fill in your passport data, select OKVED codes and pay state duty.  The state duty for the registration of the IP is 800 rubles.  You can pay it through the Internet or on a receipt, which will be generated automatically, in any branch of Sberbank. <br><br>  After sending the application within three days you will receive an invitation from the tax.  To get the documents, take with you: <br><ul><li>  original and copy of passport (usually it is enough to make a copy of only the first page of the passport and the page with registration on one sheet), </li><li>  document on payment of state duty (receipt or printout from the Internet bank), </li><li>  notification of the transition to the simplified tax system (if necessary). </li></ul><br>  If you do not have time to get the documents, the application is canceled.  It can be issued again, you do not need to pay the state fee again. <br><br>  <strong>Regular IP registration</strong> <br><br>  For the usual registration of IP in the tax must submit: <br><ul><li>  application for registration of IP, </li><li>  original and copy of passport, </li><li>  receipt of payment of state duty, </li><li>  notification of the transition to the simplified tax system (if necessary). </li></ul><br>  <strong>Council</strong>  The entire package of documents for registration of individual entrepreneurs, including notification of the transition to the simplified taxation system and detailed instructions, can be generated on the website of <a href="https://www.moedelo.org/IpRegistration">My Book‚Äôs Internet accounting</a> . <br><br>  <strong>If you live in another city</strong> <br><br>  Documents for registration of an IP can be sent by mail with a declared value and investment listing.  In this case, the application for registration of the IP and a copy of the passport must be notarized. <br><br><h4>  Transition to USN </h4><br>  USN is a simplified taxation system.  To go to the simplified tax system, you must submit a notice of the transition to the simplified tax system either simultaneously with the documents for registration of the individual entrepreneur, or within 30 days after registration. <br><br>  When switching to the simplified tax system, you can choose revenues of 6% or revenues minus expenses 15%.  Revenues minus expenses are advantageous to apply if expenses exceed 60% of revenues.  This applies to companies that have large expenses for renting premises, paying salaries, etc. For a freelance, the STS is more suitable for 6%. <br><br><h4>  The final stage </h4><br>  After you have received the registration documents for the IP, you can open a current account and work.  Nobody needs to notify about opening an account.  In addition to get registered in the funds (PFR, FSS), as long as you do not have employees, is also not necessary. <br><br>  To open a current account, you may need a letter with statistics codes.  In Moscow, this information can be downloaded electronically on the website of the <a href="http://statreg.gks.ru/">Statregister</a> .  It will appear within two weeks after registration. <br><br><h4>  Checking account </h4><br>  When choosing a bank, pay attention to the cost of opening and servicing a current account, an Internet bank, and sending one payment order.  This is what will be the main costs of banking services. <br><br>  Due to the fact that Bank24.ru has revoked the license, many entrepreneurs have a question in which bank it is better to open a current account.  For us, this is also relevant.  Of all the banks that we managed to see, we most liked the conditions of <a href="https://2tbank.ru/business/onlion/">2Tbank</a> .  Opening a current account and connecting online banking free of charge.  The service is completely remote.  Account details will be available immediately after making an application on the site.  To sign documents you do not need to visit the bank office, the manager will come himself, will issue a USB-token for logging into the Internet bank and a free business card for withdrawing and replenishing cash.  Service per month 290 rubles., The cost of one payment order - 16 rubles.  There is a tariff without a monthly fee, but the cost of one payment order is 99 rubles.  (Payments on taxes and fees on both fares are free.) <br><br>  The only drawback is that the Internet Bank is currently working only on Windows, but as we were told in technical support, the release for Mac OS will be released in October. <br><br>  Opening a current account in a large bank is optional.  Since January 1, 2014, the money in the account of the PI is insured by the state in the amount of 700,000 rubles.  Therefore, you can choose an inexpensive, convenient, modern bank, and it will be as safe as a large one. <br><br>  If you have any questions, write in the comments. <br><br>  <strong>See also</strong> : <br><br><ol><li>  ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/iloveip/blog/237107/">Why does a freelancer need an entrepreneur and why is an entrepreneur better than an LLC</a> ?‚Äù </li><li>  " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/iloveip/blog/241179/">What awaits the entrepreneur after registration: taxes, fees, reports</a> ." </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/239439/">https://habr.com/ru/post/239439/</a></p>
