  <section class="page js-page"><h1>And the king is not real</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Surely, you have met people who are skeptical of everything.  The one that was met there ... in each of us in one way or another lives a skeptic who makes us doubt everything that is accepted in our society to be admired.  Under the cut, I will let my inner skeptic wander and tell you why some IT icons have earned more on placing their photo on the Militia's Wanted booth or unemployment benefit than on world fame and untold wealth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f20/906/23a/f2090623a1354761a6bb9b6cbbc6f534.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But before you had time to send the publication rating to non-existence - <b>THIS IS NOT ALL SERIOUS!</b> <br><br>  Perhaps I'll start with the youngest billionaire and the founder of Facebook - Mark Zuckerberg.  It would seem - young and super successful.  What is there to dig in here.  But in fact, everything is not so simple.  We should start with the fact that the appearance of Facebook coincides in time with the period when Mark promised to help with the creation of the site harvardconnection.com, with similar functionality. <br>  You probably know about it if you watched the movie "Social Network".  By the way, the court later declared the actions of the founder of Facebook illegal, which cost the company $ 300 million.  Also, if you watched the movie, you know that Zuckerberg threw out his friend Eduardo Saverin‚Äôs business, who made a significant contribution to the development of the social network.  But what was not in the film was the information that Facebook very willingly collects confidential user data and can disclose it (including to special services) without the consent of the users themselves.  It does not honor as one of the most failed IPO in history. <br>  Verdict: soulless plagiarist.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0eb/add/ec2/0ebaddec2c2641d3af2c062bd4a536e8.gif"><br><br>  Well, we go further.  Next in line is the richest man on the planet - Bill Gates.  I do not think that I will make a great discovery if I say that the company‚Äôs sources also have plagiarism. <br>  The first graphical interface was overlooked by Apple, and those, in turn, spied on it from Xerox.  The famous answer to Steve Jobs sounds like this - ‚ÄúWell, Steve, I think you can look at what is happening differently.  Rather, the situation is this - you and I had a rich neighbor named Xerox, and when I climbed into his house to steal the TV, I discovered that you had already stolen it! ‚Äù  Does Bill Gates believe that it is impossible to steal, but it is possible to steal a stolen?  We probably will not know the answer to this question.  But what we know for sure is that Microsoft‚Äôs brainchild of Gates loves to apply pressure on competitors, use non-transparent product development and good old plagiarism.  The company collects information about its users even more actively for Facebook (it became especially relevant after the release of Windows 10).  And if the antitrust proceedings were a film, then Microsoft would play the role of the main villain and probably would get an Oscar for it.  In short, sins in the pursuit of money abound. <br>  Well, in the end, how can a kind person be the father of Internet Explorer? <br>  Verdict: the greedy plagiarist plagiarist. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/62d/aa7/17c/62daa717c16f4938afd5f26392f8e9de.jpg"><br><br>  I will probably end with this, but I can‚Äôt finally uncover the whole truth about a tough nut - (co-) Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia.  There will not pass the banal arguments about plagiarism or collecting information about users.  It may even be mistaken that Jimmy deserved to be on IT Olympus thanks to the notorious wiki concept.  But if you delve into the dirty linen, it turns out that Jimbo is even worse than our previous heroes.  The fact is, ‚ÄúWikipedia‚Äôs great-grandfather‚Äù (according to the creator himself) is his own search engine, bomis.com.  Now it no longer exists, but if you went there in the 2000th year, you would see that it deals with content that very often borders on pornography, and sometimes this line goes beyond.  In fact, the main profit came from the premium.bomis.com paid section, which provided access to exclusive porno-content.  Under the big question is also the accuracy of Wikipedia itself.  A model where many authors can edit articles often introduces ambiguities, controversial facts, and sometimes misinformation.  If there were a rating of sites that misled most people, then Viki would probably hit the top ten. <br>  Verdict: cheat, earning on pornography. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1eb/bb2/7a6/1ebbb27a68e14b5fbfcee655e62c3eef.jpeg"><br><br>  Of course, all of the above is exaggeration and irony.  The individuals mentioned above are patrons of the arts, excellent managers and, in the end, just good people.  If they were even kinder, it is quite possible that the merciless world of business would not give them a chance to become the idols of the IT era. <br>  PS Inspired by a series of articles by Vasily Troilov on sports topics. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297192/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297192/</a></p>
