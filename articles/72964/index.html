  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Canon 1D Mark IV is catching up</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Well, Canon received a reporter's ‚Äúunit‚Äù update, a camera whose users had been waiting for updates for two years - it was announced half a year before its main competitor, Nikon D3, and if in the Nikon camp the model was the first truly professional model and its consumer waited, then the canonists were already spoiled by the attention of the producers (this strongly determined the subsequent Nikon sales jump), and if Nikon last week released a reporter model of only the second generation, today's Canon update is already the fourth, and therefore the company  like I should know what you want to market.  Despite the expectations, the office once again did a little something wrong, the reasons for which we will say below. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="http://focused.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Canon_1d_mk4_1_thumb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  With the transition to a full frame, the disputes about megapixels and picture quality did not subside, there is no unity in the reporter environment - some will say that today you only need to take a full frame (Nikon), others that a small crop ‚Äúfor the eyes‚Äù (Canon), because the focal length of telephoto lenses, for example, can be increased 1.3 times.  In addition, this size for reporters has been around for a long time, and canonists have long been accustomed to.  Who is right can be determined only by the quality of the photos, because, in fact, the other characteristics of the devices are similar.  As always, the new release will generate a bunch of flames on the forums, and reporters will continue to shoot with what is.

      Firstly, what the manufacturer puts in the first place is a new 45-point autofocus sensor, 39 of which work perfectly with high-aperture lenses.  A new feature - point autofocus, which will be introduced into the new lenses of the company.  Represent it will be a separate button directly on the lens, which will be responsible for focusing on a narrow central area.  Introduced here and the function of a separate binding of the focal points for vertical and horizontal orientation, already implemented in 7D.  In live view mode, two focusing modes are available, by phase sensor and contrast type by camera matrix. <br><br>  The matrix, by the way, has grown strongly in resolution - from 10 to 16 megapixels and has received the same sensitivity as the <a href="http://focused.ru/5877/">Nikon D3s</a> , ISO 102400 and a fairly advanced noise control system.  It turns out that even though the pixels are twice as small here, the process allows you to push noises twice as efficiently as a competitor.  In principle, the office pretty confidently demonstrates that, although the pixel size was reduced, the photosensors themselves did not become smaller, but they removed the gaps between the microlenses. <br><br>  The 76 stitches in the camera are rubber-coated, which protects it well against foul weather conditions.  The screen in the camera is also a large 3-inch, high resolution and bright.  Together with HD 1080p video, a built-in microphone came into the device, which allows you to attach audio tags to pictures or just shoot video with sound. <br><br>  In general, if it were not for the dispersed matrix, the camera would have been absolutely beautiful - even the video, about which everyone had long screamed that it was superfluous in the camera, has now become a competitive factor, and if they say that Canon is better than Nikon at least video (so it is - by the way, Vincent Laforet <a href="http://vincentlaforet.smugmug.com/Laforet-Videos/Nocturne-Canon-1DMKIV-Video/10024122_sqhwE">even</a> tested the <a href="http://vincentlaforet.smugmug.com/Laforet-Videos/Nocturne-Canon-1DMKIV-Video/10024122_sqhwE">video with the</a> new SLR), then Nikon is better than Canon matrix.  The benefits of using full-frame wide-angle lenses (not infrequent for reporters) will be very noticeable.  At the same time, telezums will reach 30% further, i.e.  You can play the pros and cons for a very long time.  Competitors, in fact, finally equaled. <br><br>  Specifications of <a href="http://focused.ru/camera/canon/1dmarkiv">Canon EOS 1D Mark IV</a> <br><br><ul><li>  Canon CMOS matrix with a resolution of 16.1 megapixels, APS-H dimensions (crop factor √ó 1.3), ISO sensitivity 100-12800, extension from 50 to 102400, with an integrated three-stage system for dust matrix removal </li><li>  dual digic 4 processor </li><li>  metering 63-zone integral, weighted average, spot </li><li>  New 45-point autofocus sensor with 39 highly sensitive focus points </li><li>  10 frames / sec continuous shooting at full-frame resolution (changeable, 3 or 10) in 121 JPEG or 28 RAW series </li><li>  electromechanical shutter, shutter speed range 1 / 8000-30 sec, ‚Äúby hand‚Äù, flash synchronization 1/300 sec;  shutter life of 300,000 actuations </li><li>  no built-in flash </li><li>  optical viewfinder with 100% frame area coverage and magnification x0.76 </li><li>  3-inch high-definition LCD screen (920,000 dots) with wide viewing angle </li><li>  2 viewing modes on the LCD screen with a raised mirror, in order to avoid excessive shaking of the camera body </li><li>  file formats: jpeg / raw (compressed, uncompressed, 14 bits), mov </li><li>  1080p HD video </li><li>  ability to work with GPS data </li><li>  remote control capability </li><li>  new tonal image adjustment system with a choice of preferred tones </li><li>  D-Lighting function to optimize light and dark areas </li><li>  HDMI 1.3a, AV, Microphone, N3 Outputs </li><li>  Data storage: Compact Flash and SD memory expansion slot </li><li>  Russian language support in the menu </li><li>  dimensions: 156 √ó 156.5 √ó 80 mm, weight 1180 g. </li><li>  Delivery: November 2009 </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72964/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72964/</a></p>
