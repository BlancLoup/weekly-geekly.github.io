  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cyberwar, big guns, cool interfaces, blood of enemies - what else is necessary for happiness?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The prerequisites for this story were set back in <strong>2005</strong> , to be exact - <strong>on September 21</strong> .  On this day, the South Korean government officially announced the launch of a robot soldier development program. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/b2f/de3/eae/b2fde3eae105225ee78737122cff1d7a.jpg" width="217" height="241" alt="robosquad" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  Judging by the images, the South Korean government is completely lacking in imagination, but they have never heard of the <strong>Terminator</strong> .  But that's not the point. <br><br>  With the very statement, the entire population of the planet has become one more small step closer to the technological Armageddon, the arrival of <strong>SkyNet</strong> or the <strong>Architect</strong> at the head of the management (I must say, fairly bureaucratic) structure. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But returning to the theme of Korea - a joint project of the Ministries of Defense and Information and Communications suggests the creation of an army of six or eight-limb kilots to perform work in which we are too good. <br><br>  These full-sized, insect-like robots will rush to the places of combat battles, finding mined areas and using fire power to send short-minded to the forefathers.  According to the plan.

      Shortly after, <strong>on February 17, a</strong> review article was published in the popular ( <em>in narrow circles</em> ) <strong>New York Times newspaper</strong> , devoted to the goal of the Pentagon to make the majority of the country's military force (&gt; 50%) for 10 years. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/4c4/1e4/9bf/4c41e49bf7990b60111460d2af209ce9.jpg" width="231" height="117" alt="boom!" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"><br>  Naturally, the modern concept of " <em>army of robots</em> " is in fact still very far from human-like, high-tech killing machines from the point of view of technology, and doubly further from the point of view of artificial intelligence, so necessary in this entertainment.  However, there are already several robots in service with the US Department of Defense that neutralize bombs and other explosive compounds, as well as sniff out everything around them (the latter are actively used in Iraq, as well as in the caves of Afghanistan). <br><br>  The toy captured in the picture is a prototype of the <strong>TALON</strong> robot.  Initially, he was a modest boy (?) And was engaged only in demining, but this seemed not enough for the US military forces and they took a file in their hands and supplied him <strong>with four 66-mm missiles</strong> , <strong>six 40-mm grenades</strong> , and an automatic <strong>M240 or M249</strong> automatic machine <strong>gun</strong> - to choose from.  Now this killer is intended for escorting <s>particularly dangerous</s> vehicles and patrolling the terrain.  Control is exercised from the remote control. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/b6a/977/85a/b6a97785ab16a3b196dacf5c46abb6f3.jpg" width="400" height="305" alt="irobot" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  The next step was the launch of the <strong>Sentinel</strong> project, sponsored by the ubiquitous US government.  These <strong>cuties</strong> ( <strong>iRobots</strong> - have no relation to Apple, although what the hell are not joking) do not know how to vacuum the floors or do the dishes, in truth - the device doesn‚Äôt know how to <em>do anything at all</em> .  We are interested in the device from another point of view - a flock of such semi-automatic robots can be controlled from a single <strong>Tablet-pc</strong> , for example. <br><br>  Unfortunately, at the moment they are doing quite peaceful tasks: working out the behavior on the ground, detecting hostile structures and the like dullness.  But there is no doubt - a big muzzle hooked to them.  A better flamethrower, yeah. <br><br>  The next milestone of development is the statement of the government of a distant country. India, <strong>on May 18, 2006</strong> , of the intention to create a mechanized army.  After the grand opening of the building of <strong>the</strong> Defense Research and Development Organization, it was officially announced that the next generation technologies would be launched in the field of <em>camouflage, movement and guidance systems</em> (I will weep if the Indians are the first to invent the costume a la Crysis) .  However, the Indian press release was extremely stingy in details, although it is known <em>that the impetus to the beginning of such developments was the realization of the possibility of aggressive actions by other states</em> .  Really. <br><br>  But I did not start this conversation in order to discuss the caliber of machine guns or the number of victims of international conflicts, <strong>no-fig</strong> . <br><br>  Since the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã" <em>electronicization</em> " of the defense industry is now as strong as ever - sooner or later a structure should appear on the scene that would develop the <strong>virtual space</strong> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/4f6/a98/fc0/4f6a98fc002eded31fbb822d103d9e00.jpg" width="450" height="194" alt="ironmaninterface" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  Remember the interface in a suit of <strong>Iron Man</strong> ?  Or the control system of the gate of <strong>Zion</strong> ?  This is exactly what the <em>Agency for Advanced Defense Research Projects</em> (DARPA) is trying to create.  <strong>National Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãRange</strong> , this is the name of the project, which is currently being developed, will serve primarily as a virtual training ground for future cyber warriors. <br><br>  In addition to remote control of robots, there is another, equally important, goal.  This is working out various options for responding to computer attacks and attacks on the valuable information of state structures. <br><br>  That is, in essence, the development of <s>a</s> virtual environment <s>terminator</s> has already begun, the person will dive into by connecting <s>to the matrix of the</s> main sense organs to the computer interface. <br><br>  We are waiting - we will not wait. <br><br>  via <a href="http://dvice.ru/blogs/r2d2/52">Dvice</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/25165/">https://habr.com/ru/post/25165/</a></p>
