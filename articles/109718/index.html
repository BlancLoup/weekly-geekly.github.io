      My early childhood was spent in the village of Pirovskoye, three hundred kilometers north of Krasnoyarsk, - my father, doctor, were sent there for life after the camp, where he served his sentence as an enemy of the people, as well as a Polish and Japanese spy.  It was the beginning of the fifties.  The lights in Pirovskoye were turned off the clock, it seems, at ten in the evening.  Well, maybe at half past ten.  It was the norm: and the electrician had to rest, and save fuel.  And nothing.  Lived for yourself. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There was not even a feeling that they endured.  Such conditions were just.  Everybody has kerosene lamps at the ready, and, just in case, they suddenly don‚Äôt deliver kerosene, a certain supply of candles.  My father even did emergency operations in the hospital under a kerosene light.  So that there was no heat (and in winter it sometimes rolled under minus fifty) - even no one came up with an idea: there was taiga (standing wood) all around, hot houses in the houses.  Water from wells, and where there was none - they drove from Belaya river.  The food, too, was koohtal, mooed and bebekala, bee-buzzing in the immediate vicinity of the house.  I remember that a very young sheep, Yarochka, was even kept right in the kitchen for a while.  In the garden, my father dug a smokehouse ... <br><br>  Even before that, for almost one hundred one hundred and fifty in similar conditions, practically all of Russia lived, with the exception of a couple of capitals and large provincial cities, and in two to three hundred years as well as all of Europe. <br><br>  That is, if we exclude strong earthquakes and terrifying floods, which, fortunately, could not be in Pirovsky, the person was adapted to the environment and did not depend on anything.  Only, perhaps, from himself: his strength, energy, ingenuity. <br><br>  And right from there, from the depths, jump into today.  I, frankly, just shook the voice search (more widely - voice input) from Google (see, for example, ‚ÄúHuman voice‚Äù, <a href="http://www.rian.ru/authors/20101019/287077911.html">www.rian.ru/authors/20101019/287077911.html</a> ) or ‚ÄúTram‚Äù, <a href="http://www.aif.ru/techno/article/38112">www.aif .ru / techno / article / 38112</a> ).  Not that my belief in the stupidity of computers, in the impossibility of genuine artificial intelligence (‚ÄúEyes of my dog‚Äù, <a href="http://trendclub.ru/4899">trendclub.ru/4899</a> ) the above-mentioned voice search shaken, but I was convinced that if I had enormous computer power and incredible volumes a database (which, fortunately, Google has), - this very artificial intelligence can be very successfully, - in some areas, - imitated.  And, in the end, what difference do we, the users, have this intelligence or its imitation, if it works!  If you understand the principle of this work, you won‚Äôt slip a Japanese chainsaw, as in the old joke, you will be limited to trees.  Not a single city where I visited recently, Google‚Äôs voice search never made a mistake in recognizing any local address (because there is a complete set of addresses in the database) - you should start dictating different ‚Äústrange‚Äù, not first, names, error on error.  Do you know the old trick, the so-called psychological trick?  The magician asks a person from the audience to secretly write on paper the name of the fruit, the river and the name of the poet.  Then he loudly says: Apple, Volga, Pushkin.  And in 99 cases out of 100 gets to the point.  Because to the average ‚Äúperson from the audience‚Äù these are the words that first came to mind.  So here: if you ask Google to recognize an ‚Äúapple‚Äù - it will do it at a time, if ‚Äúlichi‚Äù, it will most likely be mistaken.  Well, or present heel-other options.  For a truly intelligent choice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/83e/6be/60f/83e6be60f5f1f588579fd5ed23307379.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  One way or another, voice input makes my life much easier.  Not just in the Internet search or geolocation, not even in the dictation of SMS and short emails - even in writing articles.  There, however, you have to edit a lot, but when you work with a communicator with its not-too-comfortable virtual keyboard, the circle still turns out faster and more convenient.  Easy life and addictive. <br><br>  And now, somewhere on the street, you call a voice search and get a sign "Connection problems".  Or, in the case of a cellular GPRS connection, there are long connection attempts and, in half the cases, an arc out.  That is, the service is located somewhere on the server.  In the cloud.  And here, on the communicator - his tiny terminal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8b6/0ba/882/8b60ba882ce6341780f51bc1e54d41b7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Another close example.  There is a fantastic translator on Android called TransZilla.  52 languages ‚Äã‚Äãin each direction, automatic language recognition, voice input, reading aloud.  It works - well, not worse than the stationary ProMT.  It weighs 316 kilobytes!  (while ProMT is at least 132 megabytes).  This means that TransZilla lives somewhere on the Cloud. <br><br>  Like your Facebook accounts or Twitter.  As your letters (and answers to them) public mail servers.  How, - at many - address books and calendars.  How - more and more often - important working papers. <br><br>  A little more, a little more - and the vast majority of your work and your digital life will generally be somewhere near God - in the clouds.  And you will become critically dependent no ... not even on electricity suddenly cut down ... not even on a broken trans-oceanic optical cable ... Just ... Just from the lack of Wi-Fi.  Well, it will not be anywhere, where you need to work or find the right address - and all the cases!  Or there will be a buggy, slow, unreliable GPRS instead of it, and at a hundredfold roaming rates. <br><br>  That is, the further we go along the track of progress, the more dependent we become on the infrastructure.  Elementary to destructible: it is not a nuclear power plant to undermine you.  Or even a simple disconnect. <br><br>  And we instantly freeze, as African natives suddenly fell at zero temperature. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109718/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109718/</a></p>
