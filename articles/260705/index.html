You can read about it, for example, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/first/blog/241603/">here</a> .  These certificates are also in the 3CX Phone System distribution and are used, in particular, to transfer your license information to 3CX securely. 
      <br>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

        </script>
      <br>
      Since soon SHA-1 certificates will be declared unsafe, 3CX decided to replace these certificates in its licensing center with the modern standard SHA-2.  However, certificate renewal is also required in all running installations of 3CX Phone System.  The problem is that outdated versions of 3CX can no longer be updated.  <strong>And if they are not updated, when changing certificates on the 3CX licensing server, these systems may stop working at any time.</strong> <br><br>  Therefore, we decided to upgrade all outdated versions of 3CX Phone System to new ones, which are subject to automatic updating! <br><br>  All systems up to version 11 are subject to free upgrade. <br><br>  In addition, all systems of version 12 and 12.5 with an overdue subscription to updates received the right to free upgrade to version 3CX 12.5! <br><br>  However, it must be borne in mind that if you have 3CX Phone System installed on a 32-bit version of Windows, you will not be able to upgrade to v12.5, since it only works on a 64-bit version.  Therefore, we recommend upgrading the OS to at least Windows 7 64 bit in order to upgrade to the latest version of 3CX Phone System for free. <br><br>  <strong>Free transition to the latest version of 3CX is possible only until July 15, 2015!</strong> <br><br><h2>  Why is it important to upgrade 3CX Phone System? </h2><br><ul><li>  All versions of 3CX to v11 may stop working. </li><li>  All versions 11, 12 and 12.5 without the latest updates installed may stop working. </li><li>  You get a unique opportunity to upgrade to the latest version of 3CX for free. </li><li>  Your expired subscription to updates will be restored for free, and you do not need to overpay for the restoration of a subscription! </li><li>  In the future, you can upgrade the system using a <a href="http://www.3cx.com/ordering/pricing/3cx-maintenance/">standard subscription to 3CX updates</a> . </li></ul><br><h2>  Why the outdated version of 3CX Phone System may stop working? </h2><br>  3CX Phone System is a commercial product that is activated by the purchased license key.  When activated, the system is tied to the current hardware configuration, in particular, the configuration of network interfaces.  This means that when changing the MAC addresses of the equipment, for example, when a new network adapter appears or when the system is transferred to a new server, 3CX must be reactivated.  Of course, this happens infrequently. <br><br>  If the hardware configuration is unchanged after activation, 3CX can operate in an isolated network without Internet access.  It will work after July 15, 2015, without any updates.  However, the administrator may not take into account that his system is not updated and with a regular replacement of equipment will receive a system that can not be activated.  Although he will try to give her access to the Internet and activate it, 3CX will have already updated its activation server by then.  And you will find yourself in a stalemate. <br><br>  <strong>These are the problems we are trying to avoid by publishing this article.</strong> <br><br>  Below we provide recommendations for each version of 3CX that may be installed. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Version 3CX below 11 </h2><br><ol><li>  Backup your system. </li><li>  Download 3CX Phone System v.11 from here <a title="http://downloads.3cx.com/downloads/3CXPhoneSystem11.exe" href="">http://downloads.3cx.com/downloads/3CXPhoneSystem11.exe</a> </li><li>  Install it by restoring the configuration from the backup made in step 1. </li><li>  Activate the system with your current key - it has already been updated to v11! </li><li>  Go to <strong>Management Console&gt; Updates&gt; 3CX Updates</strong> and download <strong>Service Pack 4B - License Update - Build 30296</strong> </li><li>  Please note that 3CX no longer provides official technical support for 3CX Phone System v11. </li></ol><br><h2>  Version 3CX 12 without upgradeability to 12.5 (32 bit OS) </h2><br><ol><li>  Go to <strong>Management Console&gt; Updates&gt; 3CX Updates</strong> and download <strong>Service Pack 6.2 - License Update - Build 41311</strong> .  Please note that updates are installed only through the Winforms console, but not through the browser! </li><li>  If 3CX reports that your subscription to updates has expired, re-activate your system with the existing key, and then follow the steps in step 1. </li><li>  Please note that step 1 should be done before July 15, 2015, after which we cannot guarantee the performance of your system. </li></ol><br><h2>  Version 3CX 12 with the ability to upgrade to 12.5 (64-bit OS), but an expired subscription to updates </h2><br><ol><li>  Backup your system. </li><li>  Download 3CX Phone System v12.5 from here <a title="http://downloads.3cx.com/downloads/3CXPhoneSystem125.exe" href="">http://downloads.3cx.com/downloads/3CXPhoneSystem125.exe</a> </li><li>  Install it by restoring the configuration from the backup made in step 1. </li><li>  Activate the system with your current key - it has already been updated to v12.5! </li><li>  Go to <strong>Management Console&gt; Updates&gt; 3CX Updates</strong> and download <strong>Service Pack 1 - License Update - Build 41543</strong> . </li><li>  Please note that the free update will be available until July 15, 2015. </li></ol><br><h2>  Version 3CX 12 with the ability to upgrade to 12.5 (64-bit OS) and active subscription to updates </h2><br><ol><li>  Backup your system. </li><li>  Download 3CX Phone System v12.5 from here <a title="http://downloads.3cx.com/downloads/3CXPhoneSystem125.exe" href="">http://downloads.3cx.com/downloads/3CXPhoneSystem125.exe</a> </li><li>  Install it by restoring the configuration from the backup made in step 1. </li><li>  Activate the system with your current key. </li><li>  Go to <strong>Management Console&gt; Updates&gt; 3CX Updates</strong> and download <strong>Service Pack 1 - License Update - Build 41543</strong> . </li></ol><br><h2>  Version 3CX 12.5 (64-bit OS) with active subscription to updates </h2><br><ol><li>  Go to <strong>Management Console&gt; Updates&gt; 3CX Updates</strong> and download <strong>Service Pack 1 - License Update - Build 41543</strong> . </li></ol><br>  Once again we remind you that the permissible period of free transition to new versions of 3CX Phone System is until July 15, 2015. <br><br>  <strong>In order to avoid possible problems and downtime of your business, we strongly recommend to use this opportunity!</strong> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/260705/">https://habr.com/ru/post/260705/</a></p>
