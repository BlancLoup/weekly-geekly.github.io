  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About Nikonov. Part 1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The writer Alexander Nikonov, who has read only scientific literature in his life, says that a person from megatons of information perceives only that to which he is predisposed.  Suppose you decide to buy a car.  Once you have made this decision, a new filter will appear somewhere inside you.  Without asking you, he will pull out of the newspapers, television, the Internet, books, conversations, his own thoughts all that concerns the purchase and maintenance of cars.  And, despite the fact that such information has always been around and partly inside you, you began to notice it only after the appearance of the internal filter. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  This change in consciousness will help in a relatively short time to obtain a significant amount of knowledge, which later will help make the right decision.  Obviously, it would be nice to create a filter that collects information on how to become rich.  It would seem that there is something difficult?  Everyone wants to be happy and rich, and information, bitch, somehow does not accumulate or accumulate, but fuck does not help. <br><br><blockquote>  Thoughts on the topic.  Try to look into your brain through your eyes and count how many filters it actually costs.  The more filters, the more interesting, happier and richer the person is physically and spiritually.  From where and how they appear, read in the following sections. </blockquote>

      It is worth clarifying that there is an endless difference between ‚Äúdreaming about a car‚Äù and ‚Äúplanning to buy a car‚Äù.  Dreaming about the car, a person can read magazines, watch programs about the car, know that he likes this car, but this is complete bullshit.  A person thinks that one day he will have a lot of money and he will buy himself a cool car.  A faithful plan to buy a car.  Determine the date of purchase, for example, after a year or two, the required amount, as well as such little things as make and color. <br><br>  For the year of collecting (filtering) information, it is highly likely that the initial decisions about the car were wrong.  As the color is not so fashionable for a long time, and the car itself should be bought cheaper.  So, the filter appears only when we plan, but do not dream, and the more detailed our plan, the more information in it, the more significant will be the benefits of our fashioning friend. <br><br><blockquote>  Thoughts on the topic.  After buying the car, the filter is immediately turned off.  The brain stops paying attention to the extra information.  And now, try to realize that information passes through you that can make you a rich and happy person for several years.  Maybe, but why not?  You just have a crappy brain. </blockquote><br><br>  To be continued. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/25149/">https://habr.com/ru/post/25149/</a></p>
