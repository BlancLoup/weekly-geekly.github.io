And I became a little thoughtful - what if I tried to apply it to the educational process?  This is not about the ubiquitous replacement and revision of the curriculum, not at all.  I thought about the use of gamification in the learning process of individual students.  Let's say our children, nephews, cousins ‚Äã‚Äãor siblings.  The goal is to attract and captivate the child's learning process and contribute to his interest in learning. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Why do children reluctantly learn something at school?  It seems to me that there are 3 reasons for this: <br>  1) Learning is a boring and tedious process. <br>  2) The result of learning is not visual <br>  3) Lack of motivation <br><br>  When I was still in school myself, my parents encouraged my learning progress with pocket money.  We had a table of tariffs - for some estimates I get money in the piggy bank, and for some I give.  And over time, as a bonus, all the pyataks (5 rubles coins) were given to me and formed into a tuba.  When the tube was filled, there were Pyataks for 100 rubles.  Remembering this, I decided to reflect on the topic of gamification of education for my future children. <br><br>  I really like games.  Especially RPG.  And I decided, why not beat the school child in school as an RPG game?  Further, I dare to fantasize a little bit on this topic and to sum up, what a result. <br>  An important condition is that our child is just beginning to study at school.  It would hardly make sense to "play" in school with an 8th grader.  Suppose our child is 8 years old, and he recently went to the second grade.  He already knows that the school is not so interesting, so we offer him a game.

    <h4>  Game race </h4><br>  To begin, we choose the game race for our student.  Each race has its strengths and weaknesses.  The race of our student is his future specialization.  A child can choose his own race.  Let for a start it will be the standard 4 races: man, elf, orc, dwarf.  I don‚Äôt set myself the goal of creating strict rules and frameworks, since  we are dealing with a living and important person for us (our child, after all).  I will give an example on two races.  Every plus race is a school subject. <br><br>  <i>Elf:</i> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Dexterity (physical education, specifically athletics) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Connoisseur of nature (natural science, biology, chemistry) <br>  ‚Ä¢ A sense of beauty (music, art, dancing) <br><br>  <i>Dwarf:</i> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Technician (drawing, mathematics) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Mining (geography) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Curiosity (physics) <br><br>  And thus, we can more or less determine the future specialization (profession) of our child.  If you think that a child chose a race for himself not objectively, then as a master of the game you have the right to make a half-breed out of him.  A half-breed may have some additional abilities.  For example, an edf-dwarf half-breed will be able to have the ability to receive additional double awards for similar specialties.  To implement the races, you can even come up with cards in the manner of the Munchkin card game. <br><br><h4>  Studying proccess </h4><br>  Imagine the whole educational process as 11 chapters (11 classes).  Each chapter is divided into 4 parts (quarters).  At the end of each chapter, the master of the game (you) has the right to summarize and give the child a reward for completing the chapter.  The division of chapters into pieces can be beaten as a character‚Äôs rest (vacation) and comprehension of the experience gained. <br><br>  The educational process should show the child clearly that he can be able to in the future, thanks to the studied.  Therefore, it would not be superfluous to spend the first day of the vacation in order to show the child the perspectives of its development.  If you think that doing it after every quarter is too much, then you can do it at the end of the school year. <br><br><h4>  Awards </h4><br>  The most interesting and most important part is motivation and reward.  The process of rewards I would suggest to build as follows.  For each assessment, the child receives a certain amount of experience - XP.  Assume: <br><br>  5 = 300xp, 4 = 100xp, 3 = 50xp, <br><br>  and for twos and units, the child will lose experience.  Next, you should create a table of levels that will be issued to the child to achieve a certain experience, for example: <br>  1lvl = 1000xp <br>  2lvl = 5000xp <br>  3lvl = 10000xp, and so on. <br><br>  Upon reaching each level, the child has the right to draw a card from the treasure deck (which must first be prepared).  In the treasure can be anything - from cash or other material reward to going to an amusement park or extra time playing the XBOX. <br>  As a child reaches a more mature age, you can add more cash rewards to the treasures, and also motivate you with money for good grades.  Thus, it is possible to make it clear to a child from an early age that it is necessary to work for material or monetary benefits. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  I am far from being an educator and not a teacher, but it seems to me that having spent a little effort and having organized such a game for a child, it will be easier for him to enter the educational process and there will not be a hard transition from kindergarten with fun and games for school desks with all the consequences.  In addition, a similar approach can help instill in the child a craving for knowledge, since  we will motivate him with this knowledge, and we will clearly demonstrate to him what he can do in the future.  I would really like to hear the opinion of the community on this subject in general, as well as on minor details, such as a system of rewards and strict rules.  Thank you for your attention and hope for the relevance of the topic. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/193516/">https://habr.com/ru/post/193516/</a></p>
