  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What would you like to see in Habr√©? Or articles that people would like to read.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On Habr√©, similar articles often come across, and when the author wants to write something, and puts the article on Habr, they write to him, use the search, this has already happened!  And they can be hard-on. <br>  Although the author may certainly not have looked for similar articles in search, nevertheless, he sometimes misguidedly misguidedly. <br>  The thought occurred to me that it would not be bad if there was a section in Habr√© where everyone could leave suggestions on what topics they would like to see new articles.  And what information is needed at the moment habrasoobschestvu.  And consequently, people who want to write a post, having seen the required information, could boldly write about it, without fear of being rejected. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This section could look like a table with arbitrary names of topics.  With the ability to add your own theme and vote for others. <br>  The votes would have a short duration, that is, by voting once for the topic that you would like to see, your vote will be counted for a certain period of time.  This is necessary in order to maintain the relevance of the required information on Habr√© and that it would always be updated. <br>  In general, frequent visitors to Habra could leave wishes that they would like to know better, as well as vote for others, for or against them. <br><br>  Schematically it can be arranged in such a way. <br><ul><li>  Wonderful Layout = 50votes </li><li>  Flash vs Silverlight = 10votes </li><li>  Google captures the world, where to look for salvation?  = 5votes </li><li>  I want an article about classmates!  = -40votes </li><li>  Online traffic = 10votes </li><li>  New programming languages ‚Äã‚Äã= 20 votes </li></ul><br>  Here we can draw the following conclusion: in spite of the fact that there are enough articles about marvelous layout on Habr√©, they are still valued and people want to read about it.  The situation with classmates is the opposite. <br><br>  Old votes for topics during the week may disappear, therefore for the desired topic you need to vote once a week so that your vote is always taken into account.  Or you can choose a different time period. <br>  I came up with this idea due to the fact that I myself would like to write about a topic close to me, but I see that there is already a lot of information on Habr√©.  Will my article be in demand?  The proposed section would solve my problem and if I saw that there were a lot of negative voices behind the topic I proposed, then I would give up my idea, or vice versa, if my topic is consistently positive, then why not write something about it? <br>  In addition, you can make a restriction on the possibility of adding your own to the list of desired topics, only those with a karma below a certain value. </div>
