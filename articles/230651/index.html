The platform allows you to quickly, conveniently and easily explore the features of the architecture and programming of the microcontroller, test your ideas, create prototypes with any microcontroller of the STM32 family. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/246/d1a/bb3/246d1abb345ef8dedc21b0b1bd63b703.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The platform board is divided into two parts, the programmer and the evaluation board.  If desired, the user can cut the board that does not affect the functionality of the platform. <br><br>  The STlink-v2.1 programmer has a SWD connector on CN4 pins (see picture above), which allows you to use the programmer regardless of the evaluation board for all STM32 MKs, for this it is enough to disconnect the board from the programmer by the microcontroller by removing the jumpers from the CN2 pin and in order not to to lose, they can be put on the GND CN11 and GND CN12 pins, the ground pins, which in turn on the back of the board are already wearing spare jumpers.  It is worth noting that STLink version 2.1 is implemented on the platform. As in version 2.0, in addition to the SWD (CN4) debug programming port, virtual COM -&gt; Usart (CN3) has the feature of defining as default Flash media, which is a very useful option for newbies. that can program the microcontroller by sending a binary firmware file (in this firmware version, not more than 20Kb) to this carrier, for example, in an online development environment such as Mbed.  Also, the programmer has a separate Usart connector (CN3 connector, RX and TX pins), which is unfairly missed out of the public view, realizing data exchange with a PC via virtual COM, which saves money on a separate device such as the CP2102, which costs about 300 rubles separately. shipping cost of the Nucleo evaluation platform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/55d/985/e49/55d985e497856baa1cb2e7a15e29af9f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The Nucleo evaluation board line supports connections to the Arduino and ST Morpho connectors, which make it easy to extend the functionality of the platform.  Connectors provide connectivity to peripheral devices and shields from the widespread Arduino ecosystem, allowing developers to conveniently and easily add special features and scale their design.  ST also offers specialized <a href="http://goo.gl/dT1MzH">X-NUCLEO-IDB04A1</a> , <a href="http://goo.gl/HR36Pc">X-NUCLEO-IHM01A1</a> , <a href="http://goo.gl/be0QiC">X-NUCLEO-IKP01A</a> , <a href="http://goo.gl/UvwZKM">X-NUCLEO-NFC01A1,</a> and <a href="http://goo.gl/22Qbwd">other expansion cards ‚Äî proprietary shields</a> that support features such as Bluetooth¬Æ LE or Wi- Fi¬Æ, GPS, audio recording gain, MEMS microphones, proximity sensors and wireless control. <br><br>  In the first photos, the evaluation boards had the quartz X2 and X3 needed to redefine the frequency of the data bus, microprocessor and peripheral interfaces; users were disappointed at their absence when buying Nuleo boards. <br>  In an official statement in response to dissatisfied feedback from users about their absence on the final product, the representative of ST said: <br><br><blockquote>  Photos were taken from prototypes, and it is assumed that the internal RTC generator will be sufficient for most tasks, if desired, the user can independently install external quartz </blockquote><br>  (yeah, for example X2 - smd !!?). <br><br>  On this note, I would like to note that the Nucleo boards, although they represent the entire family of STM32 microcontrollers, but only the younger models, in the case with 64 legs of the MK.  This decision is a bit contrary to the desire of the average person to have more and better, but on the other hand, it is worth understanding that the Nucleo product is oriented to be an accessible and simple evaluation platform for developers and designed specifically to support mbed-enabled, which gives a decent advantage to the absence of such stuffing as on Discovery boards, It is assumed that the target audience does not need as many peripherals and hardware of the microcontroller as on the Discovery boards.  Somewhere in what they are right about, and in what they are missing the Russian market, they do not control the price of their product from official suppliers, who have overstated the price (it was assumed that the platform would cost $ 11, but in Russia it can only be purchased from 750 rubles + shipping cost, which is twice the recommended price). <br><br>  The Nucleo lineup is part of the <a href="https://goo.gl/4Q0zN9">ARM mbed ‚Ñ¢</a> , a popular and dynamic project in Europe, an online toolkit for quickly and easily creating an ARM-based product. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4fe/636/f68/4fe636f68b0f57403cc3a3ed716e491b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Thanks to mbed-enabled support, developers can use the open source Mbed platform, online development tools and infrastructure from mbed.org.  It is worth noting the convenience and ease of use of this resource, or rather, I would say it is not just a resource, it‚Äôs the developer‚Äôs social networks, where users share their libraries, sample code and projects.  The resource has everything you need for a quick start and work with an evaluation board, a forum where users share their accumulated experience and help each other solve problems in debugging code, a large selection of libraries for working with almost all the microcontroller peripherals and expansion cards, the FAQ section and the opportunity ask the question to both users and the representative of the manufacturer, to communicate between users and much more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ad/f02/237/6adf0223724a8641b9a664c54784aae8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The online compiler <a href="https://goo.gl/GsQjv6">https://mbed.org/compiler</a> , an integral part of this resource, which will relieve the headache of many novice developers with setting up the development environment and the compiler, giving the opportunity not to go into all the details of the STM32 architecture. <br><br>  The director of the IoT platforms division of ARM, Simon Ford, stated: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe mbed-enabled hardware of the STM32 Nucleo provides ST users with access to the enhanced mbed-software ecosystem, development tools and the community that support the development of a new wave of intelligent electronic products.‚Äù </blockquote><br><br>  What kind of fee to choose for yourself is difficult to answer since everyone has their own needs, someone plans to develop a certain device or use a certain family of microcontrollers (for example, cheap or low-consuming), but I, having no experience, took the most productive fee available at the time of purchase for training Nucleo-F401RE based on STM32F401RE, many users did the same, who took several versions at once with microcontrollers of different purposes, someone bought all the available models. <br><br>  To date, the line is represented by 9 models, the older of which the STM32 Nucleo-F411RE differs from the widespread in Europe and the STM Nucleo-F401RE just available in Russia with a large amount of RAM (128 Kb against 96Kb) with a higher processor frequency (100MHz against 84MHz) , a large number of hardware-supported interfaces. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  MK </td><td>  CPU FPU </td><td>  Flash </td><td>  Ram </td><td>  12bit ADC </td><td>  timers </td><td>  I2C </td><td>  USARTs </td><td>  SPIs </td><td>  Sdio </td><td>  I2s </td></tr><tr><td>  F401 </td><td>  84MHz </td><td>  512Kb </td><td>  96Kb </td><td>  10ch. </td><td>  ten </td><td>  3 </td><td>  3 </td><td>  four </td><td>  + </td><td>  N / A </td></tr><tr><td>  F411 </td><td>  100MHz </td><td>  512Kb </td><td>  128Kb </td><td>  16ch. </td><td>  ten </td><td>  3 </td><td>  3 </td><td>  five </td><td>  + </td><td>  five </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  The STM32 Nucleo-F030R8, STM32 Nucleo-F103RB, STM32 Nucleo-F401RE and STM32 Nucleo-L152RE boards are already available for order in Russia, as well as apm-F072RB; L053R8 are available for order from abroad, at a price of $ 10.32 per unit. <br><br>  PS <a href="http://goo.gl/iODJm3">Ready new post</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/230651/">https://habr.com/ru/post/230651/</a></p>
