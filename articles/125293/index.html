The letters that we use in English are very ambiguous.  40 sounds of the English language can be recorded in 1120 ways.  In Italian, sounds are 25, and there are 33 ways of recording them. As a result, people who grew up in English-speaking countries use somewhat different parts of the brain when reading than people who grew up in Italy ...

      Interestingly, when learning another language, at least partial activation of brain regions corresponding to that language occurs and what effects may this result (after all, these sites may already be used for other purposes)? <br><br>  ... Our perception actually begins from within - from a priori conviction, which is a model of the world where objects occupy a certain position in space.  Using this model, our brain can predict what signals should flow to our eyes and ears.  These predictions are compared with real signals, and thus, of course, errors are detected.  But our brain only welcomes them.  These mistakes teach him perception.  The nature of the error tells him how to make a model that will be better than before.  As a result, the cycle repeats again and again, until the errors become negligible.  This is usually quite a few of these cycles, which the brain may require only 100 milliseconds. ... <br><br>  Very ergonomic real-time processing system of a huge array of incoming information. <br><br>  By the way, it fits very well with the experience I experienced, when in a dangerous situation on the road (winter road, the car partially lost grip on the road, there was a risk to either catch a KAMAZ driving on an opposite - or fly away into a ditch) in a short period of time Real-time "seen" how the machine reacts to my control actions, as if I had watched it from above-behind. <br>  Surprisingly, this is not what I could ‚Äúsee‚Äù my car, since the spatial model of the car must exist in the brain (its existence manifests as a ‚Äúsense of the car‚Äôs dimensions‚Äù), but how quickly the brain appreciated the critical situation and redirected the flow of signals from ‚ÄúExternal sensors‚Äù from tracking a dynamic model ‚Äúinside view‚Äù to tracking a dynamic model ‚Äúoutside view‚Äù, and also provided real-time output of this model to consciousness in the most convenient form for it - visually. <br><br>  Funny quote (very similar to the definition of customer requirements): <br>  ... They say that Karlheinz Stockhausen wrote one piece for an orchestra in which all musicians were instructed to ‚Äúdo whatever they want‚Äù for two bars.  During the first rehearsal, the composer interrupted the performance in this place and said: ‚ÄúThis is not at all what I had in mind!‚Äù ... <br><br>  But an interesting thought about free will - ‚ÄúI‚Äù, as an illusion: <br>  ... Apparently, decisions are made not by a separate part of the brain, but by a whole system of areas that impose certain restrictions, which determine our final choice.  But we are barely aware of all these limitations.  It seems to us that we completely control our actions.  This is the last illusion of our brain: it hides all our connections with the material world and the social environment and creates in us a sense of our own independent ‚Äúme‚Äù ... <br><br>  Those.  personality as one of the objects simulated by the brain </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125293/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125293/</a></p>
