  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bloomberg Businessweek has published an extraordinary ranking of business schools in the world</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Every year, Bloomberg Businessweek publishes a ranking of American and international business schools.  This year the rating turned out to be special: the expected learning outcome was the main criterion for evaluating business schools.  Experts analyzed what competencies students want to have after graduation and how effectively their chosen MBA programs contribute to this. <br><br>  As part of the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-best-business-schools/">study</a> , 13,150 students from various business schools, 18,540 graduates, 1,460 personnel recruiters were interviewed.  In addition, the researchers found out how many graduates of business schools get a job within three months after the end of the course and what wages they receive at this job. <br><br>  Bloomberg has identified three groups of business schools: the best international business schools, the best US business schools, and business schools that offer an MBA course without a break from their main job. <a name="habracut"></a>
