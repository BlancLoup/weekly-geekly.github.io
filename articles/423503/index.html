      In this article I will tell you my story of entering and studying in Germany at the Technical University of Wildau, paying a lot of attention to the features of the specialty Business Computing.  I will share information about the simple life in Germany, about everyday life, about their current and future plans.  I hope my story will be useful to everyone who looks to Germany as a country to study and live. <br><br>  Stock up on a cup of coffee, the story was very long! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  My way to study in Germany </h1><br>  Up to 22 years old, I lived in Chernihiv, graduated from undergraduate degree in Chernihiv National Technological University with a degree in Information Technology.  He worked on the remote and engaged in freelancing, developing, designing and filling sites.  In the last year I began to wonder what I would like to achieve in my future. <br><br>  Many of my friends began to leave to study in Europe.  Some went to work in Poland on work visas (some of them without doing so are not good at doing this), but mostly for unskilled jobs.  Having traveled a couple of times to Europe as a tourist, I realized that I would like to continue studying here.  The choice fell on Germany, and the country was liked, and the areas of interest to me, education is also funded by the state (I do not use the term ‚Äúfree‚Äù, because there is nothing free in the world). <br><br>  From childhood I knew Ukrainian and Russian, I studied English during my school years (in the classroom and on my own), who I know well since then.  Learn German?  Why not!  The decision to start was not long in coming.  He was engaged in video tutorials, then on Skype with a private tutor. <br><br>  True, this was all the same badly enough to fully attend university.  Therefore, I decided to take courses in Germany, turning to the language center in Kiev. <br><br>  We issued all the papers quickly enough, I didn‚Äôt have to wait for a visa either, it was more difficult to collect funds for a blocked account - 9000 euros.  This is the guarantee that Germany wanted from me: it is important for them that I can provide for myself for a year and will not go to work illegally (it was possible to withdraw no more than 750 euros per month).  They managed to collect money: most of the amount from personal savings, and parents helped with the rest. <br><br>  The courses were interesting, in the group there were two guys from Russia, three Chinese, a Spaniard, an Italian and two French.  Honestly, closer to the end of my studies I began to specifically cast and skip classes.  Berlin too inhaled its atmosphere, I wanted to travel around Germany, then Europe.  And the knowledge of the language has already become confident, so the courses have completed their task completely. <br><br><h1>  Studying at the University </h1><br>  Immediately after the formal completion of the courses, I enrolled at Wildau Technical University with a degree in Business Computing.  This is where the real life began.  I did not pass any introductory tests; I was enrolled as soon as I brought my Ukrainian diploma with a certified translation into German. <br><br>  In my specialty it was not possible to create a flexible schedule of disciplines, the minimum variability.  I didn‚Äôt use it either, I just went along the recommended load-balanced path. <br><br>  The first year of study seemed strongly theorized and, in fact, a repetition of what I was already doing in Ukraine. <br><br>  There was a lot of fundamental theory and boring practice.  Everywhere tests and control measures.  Passed the topic - a test.  We finished the test block, the question of the theory and the task.  There is no time to relax.  Some students (Syrians and other Arabs) immediately collapsed on mathematics.  The problems turned out to be the Germans and other Europeans.  After NSTU, it was much easier for me than for the European guys, who for the first time in their life saw the basic fundamentals of mathematical analysis.  The Chinese, according to my observation, also coped with mathematics perfectly. <br><br>  In addition to mathematics, nothing of great tension caused me (my ‚Äúcomplexity‚Äù was only to remember what I was taught at Chelyabinsk State University on the first courses and mentally link this with the German performance).  Strained load.  Everything was real, but very, very difficult.  There were a lot of microprojects on programming and everything had to be delivered on time.  Passing languages ‚Äã‚ÄãC, C # and Java, then immediately started web technologies and frameworks.  It was impossible to learn how to program from scratch (it was to program, and not ‚Äúto encode something there‚Äù), but thanks to this intensiveness, the students managed to gain knowledge of the fundamentals perfectly. <br><br>  Impressed with the course of operating systems, it was led by a man who worked at Oracle.  Strongly liked the courses on the device of modern information systems and databases.  Then I realized that my own knowledge in these areas is too mediated from reality and outdated by at least 10 years.  It was impossible to look at what we were taught at a Ukrainian university for design, without tears at all - this is, at best, the end of the 1990s. <br><br>  From the second year of study, really interesting things started and the workload became much less.  It is assumed that at this time, students will have to get a job for the prescribed 20 hours a week, but I did not do that (I was more comfortable doing the same thing as I did in Ukraine). <br><br>  A lot of attention was paid to the study of international and German law in the field of IT.  Perhaps the most voluminous and detailed area is the area of ‚Äã‚Äãpersonal data protection.  The Germans are simply shifted on it, this is their most sensitive topic. <br><br>  Appeared economic and business disciplines.  Project management, finance and marketing.  Again, everything is very modern and relevant right now: take and use.  On the modern conjuncture of the IT market in Europe and the USA, the American professor, who came from California 5 years ago, led us just magnificent lectures.  For Europe, this is the norm! <br><br>  In the first year of study, it seemed that they wanted to make us coders-programmers, mathematicians and professionals in fundamental fundamentals.  In the second year, it became clear that among us there are people who are able to manage both programmers, designers, and other narrow specialists in all areas of IT.  Without knowledge of the fundamentals of the first semesters, this would simply have been impossible, and the level of training of all students was different (someone without any preparation).  I got a strong taste: it was for this that I chose a specialty! <br><br>  Now begins the penultimate, fifth semester.  The sixth is already formal, there is practice and final work that will need to be defended.  I almost finished my graduation work (in Germany there is no our national student ‚Äútradition‚Äù to do everything in the very last time: it won't be possible to study for a long time like this).  The theme of my final work is related to balancing the resource management of a commercial enterprise.  It is based on a project that I defended last semester. <br><br>  There is a strong difference in the level of requirements compared to graduation projects in the Ukrainian university.  In Germany, any project must be justified in relevance not unfounded, but with a full-fledged marketing research, implying the relevance of at least 5 next years.  There are obligatory references to legislation within which a project can exist at all (nothing violates and corresponds to numerous ethics, among which there are sudden, for example environmental ones). <br><br>  Nobody requires implementation, the project is a project.  But if it comes to it, you will have to legalize everything with the university.  I do not fully know this area, but the point is that the university should receive a portion of the financial profit.  In any case, it is impossible to start work without start-up capital, and recently university grants are not distributed just like that (it is clear why: when ALL projects have such a high level, to receive a grant, you must be much higher than it).  You can find private investors, but only if you really know how to impress.  Investors are not people from science, but people from money.  With that very big money.  Impress any professor and "man of science" is much easier. <br><br>  Following the internship, I consider offers from Berlin IT companies.  I would be glad to write an article on Habrahabr, as I will pass it.  I am attracted to the banking sector, as in Germany it is very outdated and a large number of investors are struggling for its development, opening their companies in related areas.  Big data, systems analytics: Germany‚Äôs banking sector is just beginning its journey in the field of modern technologies. <br><br><h1>  Daily life and financial expenses </h1><br>  I have been living and studying in Germany for three years now.  A year of courses and another two years of undergraduate. <br><br>  Familiar Ukrainians helped me with housing.  I pay 350 euros per month.  Now I live in one of the rooms of a three-room apartment, in the two neighboring ones, too, one student each.  The owner of the apartment is a Ukrainian with Polish citizenship, who has been living in Germany for 8 years. <br><br>  Student insurance 94 euros per month, semester fee (semi-annually) 290 euros.  I pay 10 euros a month for cellular communication (under a contract, with 2GB 4G of traffic), I pay 1/3 of the sum for a little more than 8 euros (my neighbors pay the remaining 2/3), and for electricity in the apartment also 1/3 is about 35 Euro per month.  I hope I have not forgotten anything.  In general, compulsory spending, with the exception of rent, takes about 200 euros per month. <br><br>  For food around 250 euros, but sometimes it can reach up to 400, it is very different to count, it is difficult to calculate.  If at the weekend in another city, then spending grows. <br><br>  Transportation in Berlin and the county is free, included in the semester fee.  I reach the university in 40 minutes (the transport is excellent), I got used to it in the first year and now I don‚Äôt notice the way. <br><br>  I provide myself, do the same as in Ukraine before: freelancing and remote.  As far as it is legal from the point of view of my student status, I have no idea, and it doesn‚Äôt worry me too much, to be honest.  No one will know.  The most important thing is that, unlike a number of my other acquaintances, I do not ‚Äúearn money‚Äù in a real workplace without official registration. <br><br>  I will not say that I have a lot of free time and free funds, but sometimes I go out with my friends for a walk to Amsterdam and Warsaw.  Several times a year I go home to Ukraine, even showing the country to my new friends from the university.  Cheap flights from low-cost airlines to Ukraine appeared, entry for Europeans was free, many began to travel as tourists, because there is something to see in Ukraine! <br><br>  The author <a href="https://habr.com/users/drebin893/" class="user_link">Drebin893</a> wrote in his article about the experience of studying and living in Germany, mentioning that he completely changed his identity and even his name, just to ‚Äúintegrate‚Äù.  Frankly, I was very surprised to read this.  Have I had similar thoughts?  Never at all, it's absurd.  Berlin is first and foremost an international get-together.  It is very easy to be yourself, regardless of origin.  This is the peculiarity of European life, that one can be comfortable with who you are. <br><br><h1>  Controversial moments of Germany </h1><br>  In Germany, live well.  But I will be objective, there are also a lot of flaws. <br><br>  Very expensive and uncomfortable internet.  I pay 10 euros per month for a tariff with 2 gigabytes of mobile traffic, and we pay 25 euros per month for an apartment for unlimited ADSL 50 Mbit / s.  Coverage is worse than in Ukraine and many other countries, but everything is expensive.  Just left the city - there is no connection, no.  2G at best.  How is this possible in such a developed country? <br><br>  The tax on television and radio broadcasting, which each apartment pays, regardless of whether there is a television or a receiver at all.  It costs 17.5 euros per month, we divide by three, but it adds to the payment for the apartment. <br><br>  Expensive electricity.  The apartment goes around 100 euros per month, we also divide equally for three.  Most of all is spent on water heating through the flow-through heater.  Another extra cost to rent. <br><br>  Fines for torrents.  About this said a lot on Habr√© and other resources, I will not repeat.  Without a VPN in Germany, nowhere.  My neighbors and I bought an old laptop, installed a VPN and download torrents exclusively through it, being careful.  For three years, no letters came.  By the way, there are a lot of scammers in Germany who only impersonate law firms representing the interests of ‚Äúright holders‚Äù.  Those.  the letter may be real, and maybe a lime tree.  Money for games for 59 euros and for blu-ray for 20 euros, we do not have, alas.  There is no choice either, you have to download. <br><br>  Keeping pets in Germany is a whole area of ‚Äã‚Äãlaw.  Dogs require registration, have their own special passport and are taxed.  More precisely, the owners are taxed, of course.  My friend has her own dog, she pays for it annually around 120 euros, plus there is a lot of spending for mandatory examinations at the vet and vaccinations. <br><br>  Banking industry ... After Ukraine, even involuntarily, you wonder where exactly Europe is.  Making an appointment at banks, checkbooks, cash everywhere.  The Germans practically do not use VISA and Mastercard (except for trips to other countries), but almost many have a local Girocard.  In small kiosks, shops, cafes always accept only cash, without exception.  Cards are accepted only in supermarkets, large restaurants, gas stations.  After Ukraine, I supposedly ended up 15 years ago.  Why is that? <br><br>  It is impossible not to mention about social problems. <br><br>  There are many homeless people and vagrants in Berlin.  Unusually to see the Germans like that.  Instead of using all the possibilities of a resident of the European Union, for some reason they managed to sleep and degrade (and not old people or disabled people, but healthy guys).  This is despite the fact that there are a lot of programs for the socialization of such people, the opportunity to get a social apartment, a good allowance.  In general, there are all conditions to bring their life in order, but they do not do this because they do not want. <br><br>  There is one more topic that has festering, but it is impossible not to touch upon it: in Germany there are a lot of migrants who have come from poor countries in Africa and the Middle East.  I have heard everything about the problems connected with them, I will not repeat myself, let me just say that the problems are very serious and the Germans themselves often underestimate them. <br><br><h1>  Germany's virtues </h1><br>  Nevertheless, I really love Germany. <br><br>  Here is an interesting, high-quality, free and relevant education.  They teach really important things that are relevant today and will still be relevant in the next 5 years for sure. <br><br>  Berlin against the background of the rest of Germany is a relatively cheap city, especially when compared to Hamburg or Munich.  In Europe, everything is expensive, sometimes even very expensive, Berlin stands out against the general background. <br><br>  In Germany, excellent public transport!  With a student pass, it seems great and indispensable.  Even long distances seem close, both in the city and in the area. <br><br>  In Germany, any organizational processes are debugged.  Germans do not hold the love of order.  If something is written on paper in the regulations, it will be so in practice.  Bureaucratic issues are resolved simply, quickly and exactly as written in laws and regulations.  Such qualities are projected on the life of the Germans.  If an informal meeting is scheduled at a specific time, then at that time it will take place.  At what the Germans do not need to be reminded of it, and the Germans are not late.  This is the special difference between the Germans and other guys in the interethnic community. <br><br><h1>  Instead of conclusion </h1><br>  Thank you for reading my story.  Several years of living in Europe, I realize as a very important experience (especially in my 25).  Today, for the better, I differ from the ‚Äúyesterday‚Äôs me‚Äù three years ago.  I have a new and much broader worldview, new knowledge and skills.  Next year I finish university. <br><br>  I have never had the aim in itself to leave Ukraine forever, now I, on the contrary, feel strong involvement with my native country, realizing that having received a good education, it is more necessary for me there.  In the near future, I am planning to graduate from the university, earn some extra money at a distance and student practice, and then return to Ukraine. <br><br>  There are many opportunities in Ukraine, I want to open my business and generally benefit the country in which I was born.  I want to buy an apartment in Lviv, I really like this city.  Chernihiv is far away, and Lviv is very close to Europe.  You could say he is Europe.  There is a lot of transport, so I can always travel, Warsaw is within reach, and Berlin is close by. <br><br>  In addition to applying professional skills, I also feel useful in the field of education.  Now I have something to compare, I know the process of education in the classical Ukrainian and German university, the mutual advantages and disadvantages.  The biggest disadvantage of national education is generally known to most: with remarkable fundamental foundations, there is a serious backlog of <cut></cut>  t actual today.  But how to overcome it, I already had a lot of thoughts. <br><br>  In conclusion, I recall a quote from one of our famous Ukrainian athlete and mayor: we must look at tomorrow!  Do not hesitate to ambitious plans, be sure to implement. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/423503/">https://habr.com/ru/post/423503/</a></p>
