I think the majority of owners of phones with the Android operating system would agree with the opinion that the player supplied with the operating system is dry and lifeless against the background of iPhone or iPad players. <br><br>  One of the greatest features of the open source platform is the writing of new applications.  The openness of the platform creates competition, and competition is an important factor for the end user, because  it forces application manufacturers to reduce their cost (if they are paid) and improve product quality.  Fortunately, there was competition among players for Android.  Today we will look at the best players for Android and say that they stand out against the background of other players. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.tbig.playerpro">Music PlayerPro</a> (~ 119 py) </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/c2/aa/c2aa23beafef61f8f44c9d54b2abaef1.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/22/1a/221a61c6c54c9f1a65ef61af36ca6f87.png" alt="qrcode"><br><br>  Music PlayerPro is a good replacement for the standard Android player, which offers the user more features and a more attractive design.  For example, this player will automatically upload album art and lyrics in your music collection, as well as scrobing tracks to your account at Last.fm.  You can easily customize this player for yourself.  The player has a skin manager (there are only 9 skins) with which you can choose the most convenient player design for you.  With the player comes as several widgets. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.doubleTwist.androidPlayer">doubleTwist</a> (Free. With AirSync function costs ~ 144 py) </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/fa/9a/fa9ac51dd83f7d1cfb7b82295d11cf45.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/60/99/60996245ff315c19e3c19efa96fde52a.png" alt="qrcode"><br><br>  doubleTwist has a good reputation for bringing iTunes to the Android platform.  The doubleTwist desktop application allows you to sync your music library with your phone, just like iTunes does.  This player has one more function that raises this application 1 step above iTunes - it has the ability to wirelessly sync music with your phone ( <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.doubleTwist.androidPlayerProKey">AirSync</a> ), for which, however, you have to pay 144 pv.  By itself, the player has a beautiful design, user-friendly interface that will bring you a lot of pleasure in its use. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.mspot.android.aria">Music [mspot]</a> (Free) </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/e5/cc/e5cc4fa5d0990272e106032bc98c3fcc.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/20/1b/201badd952abf8f4fc6c62e16fab265a.png" alt="qrcode"><br><br>  Cross-platform player that has similar functionality with doubleTwist.  Its difference from the analog is free wireless synchronization with your computer, however, for this you lose richer functionality and more fashionable design of the player. <br><br>  The player works fine, updates its library very quickly.  It also has the ability to automatically download covers and lyrics.  One of the distinguishing features - live wallpaper.  The player displays the cover of the track that is currently playing. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.bmayers.bTunesRelease">bTunes</a> (~ 43 py) </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/45/80/4580730dcde4896ca681921e105e6de8.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/92/bd/92bd1b0d603f2b95fb1b0389db0db04c.png" alt="qrcode"><br><br>  bTunes has mixed reviews on its user interface.  If you used the player under iOS, there are very big chances that you will like it.  On the other hand, Androidofily, most likely, will not consider the purchase of a single player, similar to iOS.  This application is for people looking for an enjoyable interface to use.  If you have had experience with the player in iOS and you like it - this is your choice. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dorg.abrantix.rockon.rockonnggl">Cubed</a> [aka ¬≥] (Free) </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/b8/20/b820f256a959fb3a162fdd05d5f2760d.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/d6/15/d61592e2215fa788b5c82294c85745d6.png" alt="qrcode"><br><br>  This player has a truly revolutionary interface!  The player has the ability to scroll tracks by simply clicking the cube (or a pair of other epic versions of the figures).  Using this player causes a wild delight!  Having found this player during the search for applications for this review, I made it my default player.  While this player is in beta testing, I have not yet noticed a single bug in his work.  Graphics player amazingly smooth.  This player is suitable for those who are looking for a non-standard player, attractive look.  A 4.5 / 5 rating of more than 15,000 explains it all. <br><br><h4>  MIUI (Free) </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/51/ed/51ed775b5d252795a74de046f999ad6f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Although the MIUI player is not present in the Android Market (it comes with a pre-installed MIUI ROM), I think it deserves attention for its stunning design and functionality.  It can be <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php%3Ft%3D857095%26page%3D4">freely downloaded</a> from the XDA forum and I highly recommend that you download and install it.  This is another player that I use regularly (or at least used the Cube Player until recently opened), and this will be my number one recommendation for those who want to replace their standard player, which has a much more aesthetic appearance, without sacrificing its functionality.  The player also comes with a karaoke scroller that will serve you as good entertainment. <br><br><h4>  HTC Music Player </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/d9/51/d9518e35ed446004c899a85b76ded3f9.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Again, this player cannot simply be loaded, but I thought it would be bad to miss this player past our review.  This player is pre-installed on all phones with HTC Sense shell.  Its simple but intuitive interface makes it easy to browse through the list of tracks, artists, albums and playlists.  This player, along with bTunes, I would say, is closest to the interface of the iOS player.  The uniqueness of this music player is that it provides streaming music through <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLNA">DNLA</a> , which allows you to play your favorite tunes using your home speaker system. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.maxmpz.audioplayer.unlock">PowerAMP</a> (~ 144 py) </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/b0/da/b0da87dac2fb6510573076b7b33d5d82.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/f0/a7/f0a7f1f5b386b2171e97aa5218c34e13.png" alt="qrcode"><br><br>  PowerAmp is considered the biggest dad among all music players for Android.  Being the most functional application for those who do not just want to sit and listen to music, but for those who crave the best listening to music from their phones. <br><br>  This does not mean that you have to be a music expert to use it, but it comes with features that distinguish it from its competitors, such as: 10-band graphic equalizer, which is famous for its great functionality, various playlist options, (such such as dynamic queues), supporting a large number of different file types.  This application also comes with several widgets and a screen lock, a high level of customization, and the ability to scrobble with last.fm.  All this makes this application a real geek's music player. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.nullsoft.winamp">Winamp</a> (Free) </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/21/91/21910177d8f69bdc120abb826a29836e.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/0d/7c/0d7cde191aa20327cdad30782ca6541e.png" alt="qrcode"><br><br>  Winamp is one of those classic music players that fans of the original PC player have been using for years.  Launching initially as a program for listening to music on a PC, gave impetus to the creation of a similar player for Android and it was developed by such an online giant like AOL.  Winamp, like many others, provides wireless synchronization with your Winamp installed on your PC, over WiFi, and also provides many other features that make this application very versatile - including scrobbing with Last.fm and SHOUTcast, which allows you to listen online radio combined with many advanced features. <br><br>  This application has a unique design, and is still in beta, but works exceptionally well and is recommended for those who are looking for a simple update of the default music player. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br><br>  As you can see there are a large number of different players for Android, and I chose those that I thought were the best in terms of functionality and design.  I hope you can see from the screenshots and review which applications you might be interested in - and if not, why not download them and share your experience in the comments below? <br><br>  If you are looking primarily for a player with a beautiful design, then I would recommend either Miui or Cube.  If you need wireless synchronization of songs, then I would advise you to pay attention to DoubleTwist, as it has a strong development team.  If you care about sound quality, then a clear leader in this category: PowerAmp.  The choice, as always, is yours. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114727/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114727/</a></p>
