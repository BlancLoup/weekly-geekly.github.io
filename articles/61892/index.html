  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Seven portraits of designers and creatives</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is interesting to dream about what you, as a designer, expect from the future.  Recently, I joked that I would like to remain the only expert in web design on the continent more decently (like Eurasia).  Here the map would flooded ... But this is so, whim. <br><br>  It occurred to me to draw seven pictures of a hypothetical ‚Äú <em>life-satisfied designer</em> ‚Äù.  Age: from 30 to 40 years.  There is a chance that someone will see friends.  Or even yourself.  Anyway, from the outside it looks like this: <br><br>  1. <strong>Soldier</strong> . 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
      In the firm where he has been working for fifteen years, he started very young.  It would seem he is " <em>just a designer</em> ."  But it is not so.  First, he receives a salary of a full thousand dollars more than his oupenspace colleagues.  He has the coziest nook, with a window (and so on in each subsequent office where his company moves).  At corporate events, the director likes to tell, shedding a drunk tear, how they ‚Äústarted together‚Äù, ‚Äúin the basement on the outskirts‚Äù ... His monitor (and stomach) grows every year.  Three children, photos of which are attached to a corkboard, above the target with the face of Artemy Lebedev, with a dart in his left eye.  He is a soldier of his office. <br><br>  2. <strong>Butterfly</strong> . <br><br>  The company in which he (temporarily) works - the twentieth in a row.  Or twenty second.  Or ... He does not remember.  " <em>Makes them like gloves</em> ."  He likes to boast that "he <em>always leaves</em> ."  Although this is a lie: he was fired from five places after all.  He knows how to get into the credibility of the secretary, how to quickly ‚Äú <em>punch</em> ‚Äù the chair more comfortably, how to masterfully ‚Äúburn the monitor‚Äù to get a new one ... You think that having forgotten, I brought here someone who really isn‚Äôt pleased with yourself?  Nothing like this!  The search for the best is for him the goal of life.  Satisfaction and self-assertion. <br><br>  3. <strong>Art director</strong> (unreal). <br><br>  Why he was not made art director, he does not understand.  He fits this position by 200%.  He knows and knows how.  And if not everything, then certainly more than the upstart, who "took from the garbage dump" and "gave all the benefits of the world."  His favorite topic is why the project he is working on did not go.  It is clear, all due to the fact that he is not his pen.  Something else is good ... are you laughing?  (Another loser? But figs! His vocation, vent and talent - to spoil on the forums. He knows a lot, he will shut up a newcomer for a belt for sure. Well and ... amused. Would have made it really an art director, where he would take time to please the soul?) So far, he just writes on the business cards "art director".  And if they believe - this is already a lot. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  4. <strong>Art director</strong> (real). <br><br>  He is the <em>right</em> art director.  Western model.  Not ‚Äúwho became a drummer general‚Äù (as, incidentally, is extremely rare), but a real, talented, sissy.  He graduated from the design department in ... (Boston? Stockholm?) His design ideal is a yellow box on a gray background.  On the side.  To the left of the points connected by a dotted line.  Its main quality is in time to scornfully smile.  What magically makes a client feel like a stupid butcher (and pay ‚Äúyellowish‚Äù without disputes), a designer is to shiver and go to redo, and women (no, he is not blue) to fall in love without memory. <br><br>  5. <strong>Creative coarse grind</strong> . <br><br>  He is dressed not so badly.  But - strange.  And it also smells ... They say that once, in the presence of the Chief, he spat on a sheet of drawing paper with a pink gum, wrote next to the word "menu" and lit it thoughtfully.  The site came out just excellent.  And there, thanks to the big uncles (clear, brilliant), and from the fish in the social sphere - I respect him with respect.  To say he, however, is not a whale.  But something like this will draw ... Mandatory Ibiza (sometimes India, less often - Amsterdam) several times a year - and he is like a cucumber again.  In the sense - green and full of narcotic impressions. <br><br>  6. <strong>Creative consultant</strong> . <br><br>  It can be found in the most incredible places.  In the sense that in such places horses, Indians and designers are usually not allowed.  And he can.  And no wonder.  A suit of special gloss, thin Japanese glasses hovering over the bridge of his nose ... He shifts a glass with an intoxicatingly expensive cognac into his other hand, idly looks at the glossy "project" lying on the table between him and the oligarch (whose name everyone knows, there's no need to call it) and says: "not bad."  An hour later, already flies across the ocean, to another glass of brandy, to say the next "not bad."  "Design" in the mundane sense of the word, he did not know how, and can not.  What for? <br><br>  I think the list of these portraits can be continued qualitatively.  There is also a ‚Äú <strong>designer-businessman</strong> ‚Äù, a ‚Äú <strong>creative adventurer</strong> ‚Äù, a ‚Äúone <strong>-lane freelancer</strong> ‚Äù and many different things.  We all started differently and go to different goals.  It is important that the picture of the goal, voluntarily or involuntarily, is before your eyes. <br><br>  Disputes, shouts and (as an option) recognition - in the comments to the <a href="http://www.design-freak.com/bloging/sem-dizajnerov/">original publication</a> . <br><br>  PS: The seventh portrait is me, a <b>designer who cannot count</b> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/61892/">https://habr.com/ru/post/61892/</a></p>
