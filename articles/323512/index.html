The Russian segment is not lagging behind - the number of IaaS providers increases as the demand for their services grows. <br><br>  Here we largely learn from our foreign colleagues - we learn from our work experience, adapt products and services, guided by the tasks of our clients. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/323512/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/470/49d/cee/47049dceea3f4bb3bb78a827cbc990c0.jpg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a>  <i>/ Photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/keoni101/">Keoni Cabral</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC</a></i>

      IaaS provides an opportunity to implement completely new business models - web projects no longer require regular server-side projects - you do not need to spend time and money on this.  At any time you can get as many resources as your experimental or quite serious technological project requires. <br><br>  Today, more and more medium and large companies are transferring IT infrastructure management to the outside.  Business is no longer afraid to bring complex projects to the cloud - he skillfully uses a new tool to get ahead of competitors. <br><br>  One such example is <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/speechpro/blog/">the Speech Technology Center (MDG)</a> .  It was founded more than 20 years ago and during this time has become in demand internationally. <br><br>  Products for high-quality recording, processing and analysis of audio-video information, speech synthesis and speech recognition today operate on the basis of IT-GRAD <a href="http://it-grad.ru/iaas/iaas-vmware/virtual-infrastructure/">infrastructure</a> . <br><br>  IT specialists of the company prefer to regularly conduct high-load testing and actively use our cloud for experiments and new developments: from their own services to partner projects. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/268343/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/568/31d/362/56831d36275f4e0ba085ef0c3f8c4b0a.jpg" width="500"></a> <br>  <i>/ <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/268343/">How do startups need IaaS: Speech Recognition Services</a></i> <br><br>  We have already repeatedly <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/323492/">talked</a> about our cooperation with ServiceNow and its integration into the work of the Sochi Autodrom operation center.  This is one of the examples of partnership with western colleagues, but the analysis of foreign experience is not limited to this. <br><br>  For example, we found out that the quite popular Disaster Recovery service in the west is simply unnecessary for some Russian clients.  Many have enough of an alternative approach, which is to quickly restore data from a backup (without the need for any additional services costs). <br><br>  Here we are talking not only about the selection of suitable options, but also about the need to educate the audience, which is not always familiar with all the subtleties of the IaaS provider.  To this end, we are conducting one of the first corporate resources on the topic - ‚Äú <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/">The First Corporate IaaS Blog</a> ‚Äù. <br><br> <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/unboxing-all-flash-%25D1%2581%25D1%2585%25D0%25B4-netapp-aff-a300-%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2585%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F%25D0%25B4-%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/752/62c/9ab/75262c9ab6f948508be545d8af2061ca.png" width="500"></a> <br>  <i>/ " <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/unboxing-all-flash-%25D1%2581%25D1%2585%25D0%25B4-netapp-aff-a300-%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2585%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F%25D0%25B4-%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8">Unboxing all-flash storage NetApp AFF A300</a> "</i> <br><br>  Like any other tool, IaaS carries with it certain possibilities and requires attention to a number of important details.  For example, to revise the internal business processes of the company. <br><br>  When connecting to the services of an IaaS provider, a number of familiar approaches simply lose their relevance, and internal IT systems and services often have to be re-configured. <br><br>  One of the largest weather services, The Weather Channel, faced a similar problem.  The company lost a couple of dozen IT professionals who refused to work with new technologies.  The remaining 400 IT staff had to figure out how to use old hardware to create hybrid solutions. <br><br>  Of course, this is a temporary inconvenience.  Cloud applications continue to expand and capture not only the IT business, but also the royal car racing. <br><br>  For example, one of the teams (Sauber) uses the cloud to analyze the data of telemetry of race cars.  The capabilities of the IT infrastructure make it possible to process huge amounts of data on the fly and draw conclusions about the optimal racing strategy. <br><br>  Another example is Tata Motors.  It actively promotes automation and various vehicle monitoring systems.  These services are based on cloud technologies that are involved both in the planning stage and in the implementation process. <br><br>  Creating and maintaining your own cloud storage, video library, knowledge base and various directories requires multi-million investments that need to be spent at the same time to build your IT infrastructure.  A more interesting alternative in terms of economy and speed of scaling is <a href="http://it-grad.ru/iaas/iaas-vmware/virtual-infrastructure/">virtual infrastructure</a> . <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/277975/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/09a/3a8/9f4/09a3a89f41e143d4aa8d3555b13aecd9.png" width="500"></a> <br>  / <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/277975/">"Moving" to the cloud: The opportunity is not only for IT companies</a> <br><br>  Years of experience gives us the opportunity to talk not only about cooperation with IT projects, but also large retail.  An example of this is the Hamleys World of children's toys, which agreed to use our virtual infrastructure. <br><br>  Today, even large companies can easily transfer to the cloud environment absolutely any <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/277975/">services</a> that are needed to run a business.  From domain infrastructure to mail and security. <br><br>  In addition to large networks, there are many other areas of activity.  For example, restaurants and cafes, which are increasingly focused on remote service.  In this they help the delivery service.  One of such companies, the Delivery Club, made a choice towards cloud technologies because of the growing load and the need to constantly change hardware. <br><br>  Now all IT systems of the Delivery Club are virtualized, which allows you to instantly transfer individual projects from one physical server to another.  As a result, the company pays only for the resources that it uses here and now. <br><br>  PS But what else do we write in our blog: <br><br><ul><li>  <a
