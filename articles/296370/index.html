    <h2>  <font color="#5b6166">Landing pages and traffic</font> </h2><br>  The online sales system is simple.  At the initial stage, you have 2 main tools, these are landing pages (or as they are called one-page pages or Landing Page) and traffic.  Everything!  Nothing more is needed.  We need to understand how these tools work and think a little.  The main goal is to create a working system, and here I will tell you how to do it. <br><br><br><h2>  <font color="#5b6166">Why do you need a one-page?</font> </h2><br>  A one-page, in the usual sense, is a site that consists of one page and offers one specific product, service, application or service.  This can be a physically perceived product, like bricks and flowers, or a digital product - courses, discs, trainings.  Any services, from plumbers, photographers, education, courses, and ending with catering and industrial construction.  Or a site that is used to collect subscribers.  This may be the site on which the traffic from the email list is landing.  There is a huge amount of applications, in the ideal case you can use the one-page system to solve your business problems.  On the one hand, it does not matter what is on the site, but it is important that this is one real problem that the client has and you can solve it.  To make it more convenient, we will call the goods (physical and digital), services and everything else - just a product. <br><br><br><h2>  <font color="#5b6166">Why odnostranichniki work many times better than ordinary sites?</font> </h2><br>  A one-page has one specific, clearly defined goal.  Solve one customer problem that is well packaged visually.  Therefore, it works better because the user is offered one specific action.  He can either do it or not.  A one-page page simplifies the perception of information, since you yourself give the visitor answers to all his questions.  He does not need to make an effort, to look for anything.  You just bring him everything ready on a silver platter.  You fully focus the attention of the person on the product / service, show the benefits that he will receive and solving his problem.  At the same time, you close most of his objections and tell why he ‚Äúwants‚Äù to buy here, now and from you. <br><br>  A one-page has no such problems as a large site, when the user forgets where and why he came, completely losing concentration on the product.  On large sites, a huge selection of links, buttons and actions that can be done.  Users are lost in the choices and the number of possible actions.  A large percentage of sales are lost at the stage of the basket and the multi-step application. <br><br>  Using the Landing Page we are already in a good situation.  If the average conversion (percentage of visitors who bought) of an online store is less than 1%, then the Landing Page has from 1% to 50%.  But if you do not make the right structure, texts and design, then there will be no magic, there will be no magic sales from the air. <br><br>  Take a look at the example below.  I think it is clear why on a one-page it is obvious what is required from the user and where he needs to click. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/067/8a1/0c6/0678a10c6b3040579072d291afaf4ddc.jpg"><br><br> <i><br></i>  <i>A single-page solves the task of performing the target action many times better.</i> <i><br></i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#5b6166">Why site + traffic ‚â† money?</font> </h2><br>  By the end of the course, you will receive such a tool for converting users into customers, such as one-page.  Yeah, that's cool!  But if you do not have visitors on the site - traffic, then there will be no users, and therefore there will be nobody to turn into customers. <br><br>  It is important to understand that your product will be sold only in conjunction: good, quality product + good, quality landing + good, high-quality traffic channels.  Of course, something may limp, but not all.  Therefore, it is necessary to test traffic channels and hypothesis variants for a site in order to find such a pair: channel / traffic + hypothesis / site = maximum result.  Some pairs will be profitable, others are profitable, others are unprofitable.  This is normal. <br><br><img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/11a/1b2/890/11a1b2890c1f42fabcc77ce3f6d66a76.jpg"><br><br> <i><br></i>  <i>Sales always consist of a landing page and a traffic channel.</i> <i><br></i> <br><br><blockquote>  Hypothesis.  This is how you think, why they will buy from you, the key phrase here is ‚ÄúYou think‚Äù, because the surrounding reality happens to disagree. <br></blockquote><br><br>  Hypotheses need to be tested for viability.  And there is only one way - to make a site with a hypothesis and start up real traffic. <br><br>  Landing Page and traffic are profitable when two tools are configured.  With the system approach, you can find what does not work and where, then replace.  Therefore, in any case, you will create a working system.  The only thing that is not known is how many steps: 1 or 10?  But with the right approach, which you learn in this guide - the result is inevitable. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#5b6166">Quality vs.</font>  <font color="#5b6166">speed?</font> </h2><br>  A website is a tool for converting your visitors into your customers.  What is more important here?  Make the site faster and test?  Or come up thoroughly and make high quality, and then test? <br><br>  Imagine that there are 4 sites of different quality.  One will be initially unprofitable, the second - on the verge, the third and fourth will earn.  A similar example can be given to configure and select traffic channels.  Some advertising channels and ads will be unprofitable, others are profitable.  You need to look for what works for your business. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e27/7c5/925/e277c5925d1d4203a3dadda9278505e4.jpg"><br><br> <i><br></i>  <i>The result of investing money in advertising can be completely different.</i>  <i>You can not pay back the advertising channel, but you can at times increase the money invested.</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  Oh yeah, tell me that we need to quickly test and understand whether the niche / product is working or not.  If you do not have experience in dozens of selling pages, writing texts, thorough knowledge of your client and setting up advertising channels, then in 99% of cases you will get a site that initially does not work.  And on it you want to test the demand?  Do you want to make a broken website as quickly and as free as possible, in order to spend 5,000 - 10,000 rubles on advertising for a test?  An ill-conceived site and an ill-conceived advertisement are a 100% way to ‚Äújust lose money‚Äù.  So why waste time, effort and money, if the result is initially known? <br><br><blockquote>  It's like selling a broken car.  Prove with a clever view to the buyer that it is whole, and then wonder why they do not buy it. <br></blockquote><br><br>  I am not saying that it is necessary to spend months on licking a page before launching.  We still need a balance between time and quality.  It is better to do a little longer and get a result and profit than quickly prove the opposite.  <strong>Do not play business ... He will definitely win ...</strong> <br><br>  To properly create a website, you need to spend decently time and effort, and still have to spice up ‚Äúmade with soul‚Äù or ‚Äúmade with love‚Äù.  But the result, in the form of orders and profits, will pay for all the work.  Let's do the WOW effect right away! <br><br><h2>  <font color="#5b6166">Why 70% of the Landing Page do not work?</font> </h2><br>  The task of a one-page is not to sell immediately in the forehead, as many people think, but to interest and convert the visitor into some specific action, at a certain stage in the sales funnel.  Usually, one of the easiest is getting the application.  Having received contact of a future client, you already sell him by phone or via email marketing, which is much easier than selling on the website.  The sales funnel is the stages through which the client must go, from the moment when the person has realized the problem - ‚Äúthe client‚Äôs problem‚Äù and before receiving the money - ‚Äúthe sale‚Äù. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b5/9b8/5b9/0b59b85b9c6d4be4bb0f777d19857b9c.jpg"><br><br> <i><br></i>  <i>Each stage of the sales funnel sells the next stage of the funnel.</i>  <i>It is important not to skip steps.</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  I often see how more than half of the sales funnel stages are thrown out, and then they wonder why it does not work.  Why is there no sales.  This is the same as learning to drive a car.  Need a theory - practical exercises on the site - practical exercises in the city - and only then the rights and the ability to drive a car.  Now imagine that you sat behind the wheel for the first time and drive on the Moscow Ring Road.  Inevitably there will be an accident.  Similarly, sales.  The customer must consistently go through all the stages of the sales funnel, otherwise there will be no sales. <br><br>  Now in many businesses, the meeting phase for simple and understandable products has disappeared.  It all depends on the specifics of the business and the complexity of the product.  Some businesses need 5 or 10 meetings.  Sometimes the time from the first contact with the customer to the sale can be months and years, and sometimes 5 minutes. <br><br>  In any case, 70% sales funnel is customer understanding.  As he thinks, his steps from the problem to the desire to purchase, and then the sale.  No need to sell in the forehead.  Now it is no longer working.  Your business should be built on solving customer problems. <br><br><blockquote><br>  The sales funnel is such a logical chain of touch with the customer, which at each stage convinces of the ‚Äúgoodness‚Äù of the product, the receipt of value and makes you want to buy. <br></blockquote><br><br><h2>  <font color="#5b6166">We estimate the budget and charge a positive.</font> </h2><br>  Before starting any business, you first need to estimate how much money you need to spend in order to test something and what the possible profit will be. <br><br>  It is necessary to understand well how to calculate the costs of advertising channels in order to know what to expect and set realistic goals, and not to be disappointed later.  Always draw your conclusions on the numbers.  Figures unlike opinions do not lie. <br><br>  Some definitions on which we will rely further to speak the same language: <br><br>  <strong>The visitor</strong> is the person who came to your site. <br>  <strong>Lead</strong> is a potential buyer who has contacted you, filed an application for a purchase, consultation, ordered a call, or pressed the buy button. <br>  <strong>Conversion (CTR)</strong> - the number of committed actions / divided by the total number of potential visitors who could have committed such an action.  For example, 100 people went to the site, ordered 1, then CTR = 1%, ordered 10 people, bought 1 CTR = 10%. <br>  <strong>The client</strong> is the one who bought something from you. <br>  <strong>The average check</strong> is the amount that one order brings.  Not to be confused with the profit and margin on the product.  If one order for 1 rub, and the second for 9 rub.  Average bill - 5 rubles. <br>  <strong>Revenue</strong> - how much money you earned. <br>  <strong>Gross profit</strong> - how much net you earned and can put in your pocket or spend on vacation, hobby, dream. <br>  <strong>Business Efficiency (ROI)</strong> - if more than 100%, then profitable, less than 100% - unprofitable.  Calculated as the ratio of revenue to cost. <br><br>  The cost of a lead is determined by the conversion of the Landing Page, which is why everyone is fighting for this indicator.  The higher the CTR of the page, the lower the cost of the lead, therefore, it turns out more margins and profits, with the same advertising costs. <br><br>  To roughly estimate the cost of a lead, you need to estimate the cost of one click and estimate the conversion for the page.  This is all very approximate, but somehow makes it clear the future picture.  Take the average cost per click in your subject (for example, 30 rubles) and the conversion value (for example, 2%).  Because if you go through these tough conditions, and the cost per click will be less, and the conversion is more, then there will be joy and a lot of money. <br><br>  Calculate how much the lead will cost. <br>  For example, 30 p. / 0.02 = 1 500 rub.  This means that in order to receive one application, you need to spend 1,500 rubles.  From here, calculate how much you have to earn from one sale in order to make a profit.  If you sell honey at 500 rubles, then of course this scheme is not at all profitable.  And if you are engaged in project documentation, where you can earn more than 1,000,000 rubles from one order, then this is a completely different matter.  It all depends on the specific business. <br><br>  To lower the price for a lead, you can increase your conversion or find a cheaper source of traffic.  Or add virality and recommendations. <br><br><br><h2>  <font color="#5b6166">How does the sales funnel or numbers that change everything.</font> </h2><br>  The sales funnel has two huge benefits.  First, you can find problem areas in your business.  See at what stage the low conversion and there to heal your business.  Secondly, you can see the potential for sales scaling.  And these numbers change the perception of the world. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Indicators </td><td>  Initial </td><td>  x2 traffic </td><td>  x2 conversion (CTR) </td><td>  x2 CTR and traffic </td></tr><tr><td>  Advertising Budget (RUB) </td><td>  50,000 </td><td>  100,000 </td><td>  50,000 </td><td>  100,000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Price per click (rub.) </td><td>  50 </td><td>  50 </td><td>  50 </td><td>  50 </td></tr><tr><td>  Visitors (pcs.) </td><td>  1,000 </td><td>  2,000 </td><td>  1,000 </td><td>  2,000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Page conversion </td><td>  ten% </td><td>  20% </td><td>  ten% </td><td>  20% </td></tr><tr><td>  Lida (pieces) </td><td>  100 </td><td>  200 </td><td>  200 </td><td>  400 </td></tr><tr><td>  Payment conversion </td><td>  70% </td><td>  70% </td><td>  70% </td><td>  70% </td></tr><tr><td>  Buyers </td><td>  70 </td><td>  140 </td><td>  140 </td><td>  280 </td></tr><tr><td>  Average check </td><td>  5,000 </td><td>  5,000 </td><td>  5,000 </td><td>  5,000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Revenue </td><td>  350,000 </td><td>  700,000 </td><td>  700,000 </td><td>  1,400,000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Gross profit </td><td>  300,000 </td><td>  600,000 </td><td>  650,000 </td><td>  1,300,000 </td></tr><tr><td>  ROI efficiency </td><td>  600% </td><td>  600% </td><td>  1300% </td><td>  1300% </td></tr><tr><td>  Profit growth </td><td></td><td>  300,000 </td><td>  350,000 </td><td>  1,000,000 </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ypevcys8rq2hwy2/%25D0%2592%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%2520%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B6%2520-%2520%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D1%2588%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9%2520%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%2520%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%2520Landing%2520Page%2520-%2520Spagece.com.xlsx%3Fdl%3D0">Download Excel Sales Funnel&gt;</a> <br><br><br>  Calculation of the budget for the goods (average numbers for approximate estimates) <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Indicator </td><td>  Products </td><td>  Services </td><td>  Wholesale </td><td>  Infobusiness </td></tr><tr><td>  Price lead (rub.) </td><td>  500-5000 </td><td>  500-5000 </td><td>  300-1500 </td><td>  10-100 </td></tr><tr><td>  Number of leads / day (pcs.) </td><td>  1-10 </td><td>  1-20 </td><td>  35-50 </td><td>  30-400 </td></tr><tr><td>  Page Conversion (%) </td><td>  1-5 </td><td>  2-18 </td><td>  5-35 </td><td>  10-20 </td></tr><tr><td>  Payment Conversion (%) </td><td>  50-75 </td><td>  10-40 </td><td>  5-35 </td><td>  1-5 </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e05/aff/cdb/e05affcdb640406a983132209b34c619.jpg"><br><br> <i><br></i>  <i>At least 3 stages, but maybe 5, and 10, and 20.</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  For example, you want 2 orders per day.  From 3 leads, pay 2. <br>  Then 30 days x 3 leads, that is, 90 leads per month for the price of for example 500 rubles.  To attract 90 leads x 500 rub. / Lead you need 45,000 rub.  on advertising.  It will bring 30 days x 2 orders = 60 orders.  Then everything is clear, 1 order costs 750 rubles (45,000 rubles / 60 orders).  You add expenses and understand how much you can earn.  If it turns out that you are not earning, then you need to look for another advertising channel or change prices.  So you initially remove and so unnecessary risks. <br><br>  Therefore, immediately soberly and honestly evaluate: how much you can spend on advertising and what you can earn, so that you will not be disappointed later. <br><br>  Set an adequate goal to which we will go together.  Yes, if you don‚Äôt set a goal for yourself at the moment, you cannot take anything out of the course except letters.  And they will not give you anything.  Want a result?  Set a goal and we will go to it.  This is the only option to get the result. <br><br>  What do you want to get after studying the course? <br><br>  Write on paper and hang on the fridge. <br>  I want to get ____ leads for _____ rubles and arrange _____ applications for ___.___. 201__. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#5b6166">Text vs.</font>  <font color="#5b6166">Design?</font>  <font color="#5b6166">Who will win?</font> </h2><br>  It's just a fact, the success of a one-page sales determines the text by 80%, and the design only helps to sell.  If you have a super design, and the texts are about anything, then just the design will not sell anything. <br><br>  Confirmation of this - a huge number of sites in the network, which have some kind of design, but no sales. <br><br>  Text is very important!  It is necessary to write such a text, just reading it on A4 paper you already wanted to buy what they offer!  Then on the site from such a product by no means can be abandoned.  And this is exactly what we need! <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/edd/ece/306/eddece30654b40639c6210b25a31a64c.jpg"><br><br> <i><br></i>  <i>Sells first text, and the design only helps.</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  How to make a cool text that every word will bring sales and work around the clock for you?
