On the "minefield"</strong> <br><br>  For Simpals (well, this is our company SIMPALS) last Saturday was not just half-closed, as usual.  On this day, everyone was sympathetically engaged in team building.  A few days before, all the weather websites were shouting about the endless Saturday rains with thunderstorms.  Simpals was afraid, but did not retreat.  And rightly so.  As a result, all with rural tan, but happy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/2c1/15f/36d/2c115f36ddf4bb8b2b0424ce8b610dc9.jpg" width="450" height="337" hspace="10" vspace="10">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <strong>Team building</strong> is awesome.  It is fashionable.  For those who are in the tank, team building is literally ‚Äúcommand building‚Äù.  That is an event organized to strengthen the spirit of the team.  And the fact that team building is cool, we understood right away. <br>  At first we were going on a journey.  Someone slept on the bus, someone hung out on the street, someone was late.  We drove off naturally half an hour later than the scheduled time.  Not everyone had enough seats on the bus, so part of the Simpalovites stood on foot.  We drove a total of one and a half hours.  The area where the whole action took place is called Required, it is a little behind Old Orhei (Moldova).  We landed from the bus at the very moment when he was simply not able to pull us further.  He drove almost perpendicular to the fence. <br><br>  There was a kilometer and a half to go, and we took the boxes of provisions in our hands, shoved the rest into the backpacks, and went.  They walked, walked, came.  Our camp is located on the ‚Äúminefield‚Äù, so that every 5 minutes someone congratulated someone: ‚ÄúOh!  You will be rich! ‚ÄùThe fun has begun.  The first thing we ran into a mulberry.  City savages, what to do ... Dirty but still hungry, we set to breakfast on the grass.  We were not given much time, so finishing the last sandwiches on the go, we got into a circle. <br><br>  We held hands, we felt the pulse of each other, and everyone spoke a word that describes our team.  At this large meeting, we met with a team of instructors.  Well, in general, team building psychology has begun.  We sat like that in a circle of 5-10 minutes, after which we were divided into teams.  Everyone, without looking, pulled himself out of the bag on the ribbon.  Thus, we got two teams: red and blue.  Although blue all the time they thought they were green. <br><br>  From this point on, Andrey became the main instructor of the Reds team, and the blue ones - Tanya.  Both are very polite, with everyone on "you."  So nice.  And here is the first small, but important task.  Come up with a name, motto and team flag.  The Reds did it faster.  First, the Sun (each of us invented names for himself, and the majority used nicknames or something ‚Äúfrom the bald‚Äù), that is, Roma, began to draw a face on the flag.  While he was drawing details on the type of easy unshaven, the name was being discussed.  As a result, Johann Trakhtenbergovich blurted out: ‚ÄúWe love vodka and watermelons, we are cool telepumps!‚Äù This option was adopted as a motto.  The name accordingly became "Telepuzy."  The blue ones thought longer, eventually they called themselves ‚ÄúGypsies‚Äù, and their motto was simply ‚ÄúWe!‚Äù. <br><br>  <strong>Team building</strong>  <strong>Part II.</strong>  <strong>If Vavka in the head, you need to drink brilliant green.</strong> <br><br>  Then the main contests began.  In total there were 2 stages: they can be divided into pre-lunch and afternoon.  The dinner was simple enough.  But we understood that later.  In the meantime ... The first contest.  "Caterpillar".  All lined up in a "caterpillar", hugging each other's waist and breathing in front of standing in the back.  And in this way, 18 people, without loosening their arms, should have reached the finish line faster than the other 18 people.  I must say that the task is not easy.  And from the kidneys.  None of the gangs managed without penalty points. <br><br>  Then there were 4 more competitions of the same plan.  We tied knots on a long rope, then the other team untied them;  prolazili through the "web" of ropes;  passed the labyrinth all together and silently.  In general, the competitions were short, at first glance, even for children, but very useful.  At this stage, we learned to listen to each other, we became more closely acquainted, studied those with whom it was not possible to communicate closely until now. <br>  Dinner.  Long-awaited lunch.  The blue ‚ÄúGypsies‚Äù prepared the first, the red ‚ÄúTelepuzs‚Äù - the second.  Borschik turned out excellent.  But the pilaf remained undercooked.  But it was not a problem for a second, because before that was dinner.  And for dessert mulberry. <br><br>  Then the second stage began.  More complex and ambitious.  We were all instructed how to properly wear climbing equipment.  Everybody understood everything, after which they went directly to ‚Äúrock-climbing‚Äù.  But climbing was only a means.  The goal was as follows: guess the key word.  This key was an anagram of the first letters of the words that had to be ‚Äúbought out‚Äù from a hermit who was sitting on the top of a cliff.  The hermit was a good instructor Vadim.  There was another way: choral singing, which could have been an extra letter.  Both gypsies and telepuses successfully used both methods.  Gypsies even went dancing. <br><br>  Crawling managed, unfortunately, not for everyone.  And for those who succeeded, not everything worked out.  There were instances that, because of their height and large body mass, it was difficult to climb to the top, even along the ladder, which was lowered in to help from the rock.  They did it for a long time, so much so that the stones already fell.  But at that moment it became clear why the instructors forbade approaching the ladder without a helmet.  One such pebble with a fist fell right into a helmet on the head of another of our specimens, who held the stairs while the first climbed.  If it were not for the helmet, it would be necessary to drink brilliant green. <br>  In short, everyone guessed their 18-word (!) Letters in turn and climbed over the rocks. <br><br><br>  <strong>Team building</strong>  <strong>Part III.</strong>  <strong>Each dodik has its own method.</strong> <br><br>  Then everyone's hair began to move on ****: a rope was stretched between the trees.  And that's all.  The most terrible assumptions about the balancing act were justified.  Although Andrew pulled later from the crown of each tree along a hanging rope, which should have helped us, it became not so much easier.  It turned out that we had to go two by one, holding on to those hanging ropes, to the middle of the stretched rope, and exchanging places, to go all the way to the end.  It became very scary, because the trauma of this competition was obvious.  However, it was all relatively easy.  Somehow, we managed to feel the rope, keep our balance, and it was even calmer, because we insured each other from behind.  Some equilibrists got into the taste and ran for the second time. <br><br>  The worst came after.  The rope was stretched in total between 5 trees, from one to another.  That is, it turned out 4 sections of the tensioned rope, with five points of stopping.  In the previous competition, we walked only in one section and then with the help of hanging ropes.  And in this we had to go all over the rope and without external help!  Without ropes and without insurance! <br><br>  We even somehow lost our minds at first ... But nothing!  Moving our brains, we (ie, telepuses) came up with a technique for going through this stage as well.  The most brisk dancers ran forward and there, already holding the tree, stretched out a hand to the next telepouse, thus shortening the distance from tree to tree.  In the end, it turned out that 5-6 people had accumulated in the next-to-last tree of us, and we got confused in our methodology.  There was noise, din, someone jumped off the rope, sang loudly "Rock and roll is dead, but I have not yet," jumped back or started again.  In a word, madhouse.  We did not cope with the task.  For the time allotted for the competition, only 7 people have reached the end.  Gypsies also pumped up.  But Andrei calmed us down: he said that there are very few teams that cope with this task. <br><br>  After this most severe test, we again sat in a circle.  This time the topic of conversation were associations.  Each of us had to tell with which animal he associates himself, and why.  It turns out that among us there are stallions, wolves, jerboas, chinchillas, monkeys, owls, a pack of cats and cats, in general, the animal world of Simpals is diverse. <br><br>  <strong>Team building</strong>  <strong>Part IV.</strong>  <strong>Well, this is ... wine, barbecue, and then I don‚Äôt remember what ...</strong> <br><br>  After this respite, the most exciting stage awaited us.  Crossing on the ropes through Raut.  The task was to, by asking simple questions with an expected ‚ÄúYes / No‚Äù answer, to guess the hidden word.  3 people knew this key word: Andrei (our presenter) and two instructors who were waiting for us on the other side (one met, the other sent back).  From Andrey it was possible to knock out only a hint and only choral singing.  But we were already so tired that we sang not so willingly as on climbing, and not so much.  Nevertheless, we quickly guessed the word, and in the remaining time we simply ‚Äúskated‚Äù.  From one to the other, two ropes were strung parallel to each other: walking one by one, holding onto the other.  Feeling awesome!  You walk, and under you the river flows ... But you come back quickly.  You are fastened with a special mechanism and released.  On the other side of the brake and unfasten.  You only have time to sip from pleasure :) <br><br>  Who finished earlier, he had time to gain strength before the last two competitions.  They have turned out most harmoniously and amicably.  By this time, we had already learned to listen and hear the captain (and a new one was elected for each competition), learned to understand each other better and faster.  Basins took part in both of these contests.  First we had to all together, with our feet in these 11 basins, to get to the finish line.  With shouts, but in an organized way, we managed several times faster than the norm, to reach the finish line.  And we also finished the last competition earlier.  We all had to be blindfolded, without stumbling, to go through the basins, which Andrew set in random order.  With open eyes there was only the captain of this contest, Maksik.  He had the right to suggest where to put the foot.  The commander explained very easily to unseeing and uncomprehending people where to attack: ‚ÄúSo ... 170 degrees to the left!‚Äù <br><br>  All right!  Contests have been completed, finally both teams together, because throughout the whole afternoon stage we were apart, we took turns in competitions in different localities.  Now you can eat pilaf, mulberry and meat ... And wine, of course!  Well without him.  But first, the final debriefing.  Again a huge circle and discussion.  Straight "House-2" of some kind: with the sun and frontal place.  Everyone had to express their opinion about the past event.  Well, of course, everyone liked everything.  It was really cool.  Everyone had their own expectations, but ... it is beyond praise! <br><br>  The only thing that noted almost everything: it was bad that we were divided and practically isolated from each other.  Gypsies and telepuses could not interact with each other.  But this is the organizers promised to fix it next time.  Everybody liked this promise :) While we were all discussing it, myasko reached the standard, and we went to devour it with dining pilaf.  And wine.  There were also songs, a guitar, a watermelon, and, it seems, vodka ... In general, it was unusually fun and inappropriately amicable! <br><br>  Kiss all, ottimibedgovannaya team Simpals </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30298/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30298/</a></p>
