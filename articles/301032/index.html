Why ‚Äú12 week marathon‚Äù and not ‚ÄúDaily UI‚Äù</b> </h4><br>  This is a question that I was asked more than 2 dozen times :) The answer is both simple and complex - the Daily UI is very simple and this is not what I needed. <br><br>  I had several criteria for which daily ui did not fit <br><br><blockquote>  ‚Ä¢ Time had to fit into the 12 week stage, as there were more tasks for this period of time. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ I wanted to pump a skill in a sketch, since 95% of all my work is done in it. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ I wanted to pump the mobile UI, because there was not a lot of work in the portfolio and this fact was very frustrating. </blockquote><br>  Actually, the name was born ‚Äú12 weekly sketch marathon‚Äù.  Primitive, maybe, but very clear. <br><br><h4>  <b>2. What useful can be learned from the marathon?</b> </h4><br><h5>  <b>Work speed</b> </h5><br>  At the very beginning shots were given very hard, because I wanted to make a new product every day.  After a week of work, it became clear that making a product was not a one-day business and there appeared an understanding that it should be a conceptual UI. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a47/b23/4ef/a47b234ef5aa9b750208c8882a588690.png" alt="image"><br>  <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2416351-2nd-Week-Sunday-Dating-App">2nd Week (Sunday) - Dating App</a> <br><br><h5>  <b>Innings</b> </h5><br>  I finally became convinced that users appreciate the shot as a whole, that is, not only the product itself, but also the environment, including colors, shadows, etc.  Often the work went into the TOP simply because of the well-chosen colors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c88/159/124/c88159124e4639e47cba637cc1232f0f.png" alt="image"><br>  <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2462843-6th-Week-Sunday-Your-Mood">6th Week (Sunday) - Your Mood</a> <br><br><h5>  <b>Mobile UI Skills</b> </h5><br>  For me, mobile has never seemed to be something difficult, probably because I have been involved in interfaces in which more data and their organization.  During the marathon, thanks to feedback from subscribers, I discovered several details that I had not previously considered. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚Ä¢ A smartphone is a more interactive device for interacting with the user, in the interface of which you can not only tap, but also pin and zoom :) The most important thing is to make these actions obvious in design. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Basic controls should be at the bottom and in the center of the screen, because when using a smartphone with one hand, control often takes place with one thumb. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Users are more ready for non-standard elements in mobile than in web. </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e56/cfa/457/e56cfa4575ee66f2c481a3084ced9f45.png" alt="image"><br>  <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2457761-6th-Week-Thursday-Search-Area">6th Week (Thursday) - Search Area</a> <br><br><h4>  <b>3. What will the marathon be useful for?</b> </h4><br>  I recently read an article by <a href="https://medium.com/%40vanschneider">Tobias Schneider</a> about <a href="https://medium.com/%40vanschneider/the-problem-with-dribbble-8fd1627fd7d0">meaningless shots at dribbble</a> and totally agree with him.  I think that marathons are great for beginners or designers who need to quickly fill the cones, fill out a portfolio and pump skills. <br><br><h4>  <b>4. What will help you before starting?</b> </h4><br>  First of all, I want to warn those who want to start a marathon just to raise the number of subscribers or pick up orders, it will not work.  10 successful shots will be much more efficient than the whole marathon. <br><br>  For those who still decided to start, for you I have prepared a list of recommendations below. <br><br><h5>  <b>Better have a plan</b> </h5><br>  Somewhere in the middle of the marathon, I ran out of ideas for shots.  Next, the lion's share of time had to spend it on finding ideas.  In the end, everything became so bad that the time to invent an idea took 2 times longer than creating shots.  Therefore, I advise you not to rush into an adventure, but have a clear plan. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1c5/481/854/1c54818541896d8ec1b1cbaeca96902f.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  <b>Post shots at the same time</b> </h5><br>  Before I understand this simple thing, it took me 2 weeks.  Thank God there are caring people who explained that they like to follow the marathon, but they do not have time to put a like that day if the shot was posted in the evening. <br><br><h5>  <b>Use more contrast</b> </h5><br>  It would also seem an obvious rule that many designers rarely use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a52/a9b/16f/a52a9b16f67429ff47cfbf287aaf9e29.png" alt="image"><br>  <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2411401-2nd-Week-Thursday-Product-Card">2nd Week (Thursday) - Product Card</a> <br><br><h5>  <b>The concepts are good</b> </h5><br>  Concepts allow for a good implementation of ideas in other projects.  The level of elaboration of course suffers greatly, but the idea can be immediately tested. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/863/4e6/3f5/8634e63f552da9d522a1cca94dca5e3d.png" alt="image"><br>  <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2413643-2nd-Week-Friday-Smart-Termostat">2nd Week (Friday) - Smart Termostat</a> <br><br><h4>  <b>5. What not to do</b> </h4><br><h5>  <b>Do not start a marathon during trips or other events</b> </h5><br>  During the marathon, my studio moved, I was on several business trips, as well as on winter rest.  Frankly, it is very difficult to combine a marathon with other events.  Therefore, choose a period of calm in matters that do not have much work. <br><br><h5>  <b>Stop Marathon</b> </h5><br>  Everything is simple, you can not give up their words :) He said - did. <br><br><h5>  <b>Spamming</b> </h5><br>  It is not worth sharing every day your new shot on facebook or behance.  People do not like when they tape the tape with one and the same.  It will be enough to post the most successful shots that everyone can appreciate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b6/d95/588/2b6d95588b2b7923f5a1aa66fa655616.png" alt="image"><br>  <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2425041-3rd-Week-Saturday-Select-Date">3rd Week (Saturday) - Select Date</a> <br><br><h5>  <b>Put the marathon in last place</b> </h5><br>  The marathon takes a lot of energy, so it‚Äôs advisable to create a shot at the beginning of the day until your head is full of other things.  If you leave the creation of a shot in the evening, you risk quickly burn out and quit the case. <br><br><h5>  <b>Expect everyone to like this idea.</b> </h5><br>  I‚Äôll say so, everyone is frankly fed up with these UI challenges, so many people can make your decision skeptical, and also ignore your undertakings altogether.  I advise you to prepare for this. <br><br><h4>  <b>6.Conclusion</b> </h4><br>  It was a busy 4 months in my life.  After 3 weeks, I still find myself thinking that I forgot to post a shot on Dribbble. <br><br>  Anyone who wants to start a marathon, but has not yet decided, I hope that my article will help, because in my case it was an adventure for which, as it turned out, I was not ready. <br><br>  All the shots you can see on <a href="https://dribbble.com/roling/projects/333174-12-weeks-marathon-in-Sketch">Dribbble</a> and the most popular shot at <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/33128783/12-weeks-marathon-in-Sketch">Behance</a> , I will be grateful if you like the ones that you like. <br><br>  PS The article turned out to be quite popular on <a href="https://medium.com/%40RonEvgeniy/12-week-sketch-marathon-do-or-die-443faa19f664">Medium</a> , I decided to publish it in the Russian translation in Habr√©.  Therefore, I create a survey to know how interesting this material will be for you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/301032/">https://habr.com/ru/post/301032/</a></p>
