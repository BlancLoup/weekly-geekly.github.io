But they only persist in their mistakes, sorry, idiots.  It would seem that the advice is quite simple, banal and obvious, but, as life shows, not everyone understands the ‚Äúpolicy of the party and the government‚Äù. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <i>1. Persistent reluctance to read the ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù section of Yandex.Direct before starting work</i> . <br>  The method of tyke is well suited when studying a new pimp in a recently downloaded program.  If we are talking about a business tool that is able to triple the turnover of your business in capable hands, then ignorance of the basic moments can waste your advertising budgets.

      <i>2. The reluctance before starting work to study the competitive environment.</i> <br>  To place advertisements in Yandex.Direct and not to put your nose out of the personal account without analyzing the issue, not looking for changes on competitors' websites, changes in their activity in Yandex.Direct, etc., is equivalent to getting into a powerful fighter and blindfolded eyes.  In the worst case, you will break up immediately after takeoff.  At best - after a few minutes of flight.  But we cannot talk about a full-fledged fight with opponents. <br><br>  <i>3. The discrepancy between the title and the search phrase.</i> <br>  If a user is looking for selling curbs, he will not consciously click on an advertisement offering to sell curbs.  You can keep shouting yourself hoarse that this is the same thing.  The client went to a competitor without bringing you anything other than lowering the CTR and increasing the rate. <br><br>  <i>4. Three, as ‚ÄúHurray!‚Äù, Mention in the text (even worse - in the title) announcements of the name of your company.</i> <br>  How exactly your LLC is called consumer is not interested.  The context is a one-time thing.  Requested-looked-bought. <br><br>  <i>5. Remembering anything in the text, but not the competitive advantages of the product.</i> <br>  Context ad as a billboard on the freeway.  For 2 seconds you need to have time to convey the most important thing. <br><br>  <i>6. Strange, straight heroic emphasis on "low prices"</i> <br>  If the price is low - it is better to write the price in rubles in the ad itself.  Otherwise, it is better not to shake the air and not steal the extra 11 characters from yourself. <br><br>  <i>7. Unwillingness or inability to use <a href="http://wordstat.yandex.ru/">Wordstat</a> .</i>  Similar to item 2, only here you fly with your ears plugged. <br><br><br>  <i>8. P.7 plus a blind faith that the selection of words is a panacea for all ills.</i>  The long footcloth of keywords from Wordstat without proper configuration of the Republic of Kazakhstan will ruin you no more slowly than the short one you invented. <br><br>  <i>9. Frank nonsense - broadcasting announcements to the entire planet with the delivery of goods in Tambov.</i> <br>  The reluctance to set the right geo-targeting is one of the most senseless and merciless errors in Direct. <br><br>  <i>10. Blind belief that 1 click = 1 customer (usually with round eyes made).</i> <br>  Even in an ideal world, there would not be such a business model and such an advertisement, in which the conversion would be 100%.  This is utopia.  Get over it. <br><br>  <i>11. Belief in ‚Äúput bets and went to rest‚Äù, unwillingness to see how their money is spent.</i> <br>  here without comments <br><br>  <i>12. Installation (for especially emotional advertisers) rates from 10% for the transition and an angry question: ‚ÄúWhy have I been charged 100% for 5 minutes?</i>  <i>BUT?".</i> <br>  and here too <br><br>  <i>13. Belief that Guaranteed impressions are better Special Placements.</i> <br>  The more commercial and competitive topics - the more sense not only to drive traffic to the site (including garbage), but to fight for tasty customers.  I repeat, for example, for entertainment and informational sites, one-cent traffic from the guarantee will fit perfectly, but if you work in a commercial area, be prepared to receive only leftovers from the guarantee. <br><br>  <i>14. The erroneous desire to get into special placement (0.2? E? Great!), But without adequate funding.</i>  Weigh your average sales margin, the current rate in specials, the number of targeted visitors, which will give Direct, the conversion rate.  If after such an analysis it turns out that Direct is too expensive, it is better to place an advertisement in the dull reference book ‚ÄúProducts and Prices‚Äù. <br><br>  <i>15. Belief in the legend "went to Yandex Direct - dropped into the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/SERP">SERPe</a> ".</i> <br>  The Yandex.Direct algorithms and search algorithms are in no way related.  Again.  NOT CONNECTED! <br><br>  <i>16. Belief in the legend "the more clicks, the better and more buyers."</i>  The difference between a simple audience that came to the site by chance or curiosity and the target audience, who is looking for someone to give their money is enormous. <br><br>  Conclusion: The most important problem: advertisers lack common sense and clear understanding of their goals. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95031/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95031/</a></p>
