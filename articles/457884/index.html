    <blockquote>  ‚Äú <i>Article 14.2.</i>  <i>Ensuring sustainable and safe use of domain names in the Russian Federation</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>1. In order to ensure the sustainable and safe use of domain names in the Russian Federation, a national domain name system is created, which is a set of interconnected software and hardware designed to store and retrieve information about network addresses and domain names.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>2. Regulations on the national domain name system, requirements for it, the procedure for its creation, including the formation of information contained in it, as well as the rules for its use, including the conditions and procedure for granting access to information, are determined by the federal executive body that performs the functions control and supervision in the field of mass media, mass communications, information technology and communications.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>3. The federal executive body that performs the functions of control and supervision in the field of mass media, mass communications, information technology and communications, determines the list of domain name groups that make up the Russian national domain zone.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>4. Coordination of the formation of domain names included in the domain name groups constituting the Russian national domain zone is carried out by a non-profit organization, one of whose founders is the Russian Federation and which is the registered owner of the databases of this zone in international organizations for the distribution of network addresses and domain names .</i>  <i>On behalf of the Russian Federation, the functions and powers of the founder are performed by the federal executive body responsible for the control and supervision of mass media, mass communications, information technology and communications.</i>  " </blockquote><br>  According to the draft document, the Russian national domain zone consists of domain names that are in the first-level domain .RU, ., .SU and / or similar domain names that are under the control of a Russian legal entity. <br><br>  Roskomnadzor has invented several more draft orders on the procedure for providing information to the Center for Monitoring and Management of a Public Communication Network.  The documents include orders on the timing, procedure, composition and format of providing information to the Center for Monitoring and Control of a Public Communication Network. <br><br><h3>  Project ‚Ññ2 </h3><br>  ‚Äú <a href="https://regulation.gov.ru/p/91977">The procedure for</a> recording information received in accordance with Article 56.2 of the Federal Law of July 7, 2003 No. 126-FZ‚Äú On Communications ‚Äù‚Äù.  The basis for the development of: ‚ÄúClause 4 of Article 56.1 of the Federal Law of July 7, 2003 No. 126-FZ‚Äú On Communications ‚Äù‚Äù. <br><br>  The document defines the actions of the Center for Monitoring and Management of a Public Communication Network, for recording information received from communication operators, owners or other owners of communication lines crossing the State Border of the Russian Federation.  Accounting is carried out by entering information into the information system for monitoring and managing a public telecommunications network. <br><br><h3>  Project ‚Ññ3 </h3><br>  ‚Äú <a href="https://regulation.gov.ru/p/91978">On approval of the terms</a> , order, composition and format of provision by telecom operators, owners or other owners of technological communication networks, organizers of information dissemination in the Internet information and telecommunications network, as well as other persons having an autonomous system number in electronic form of information provided sub-clause 4 of clause 8 of article 56.2 of the Federal Law of July 7, 2003 No. 126-FZ ‚ÄúOn Communications‚Äù.  The basis for the development is the specified in the title of the draft paragraph of the article of the Law "On Communications". <br><br>  According to the document, telecom operators, owners or other owners of technological communication networks, organizers of information dissemination on the Internet, as well as other persons having an autonomous system number, must provide information to the information system for monitoring and managing a public communication network in electronic form: <br><br><ul><li>  <i>About their autonomous system number, as well as the network addresses belonging to the autonomous system.</i> </li><li>  <i>On interaction with telecom operators having a number of an autonomous system, owners or other owners of technological communication networks, other persons.</i> </li><li>  <i>About the places of connection of their communication facilities to communication lines crossing the border of the Russian Federation</i> </li><li>  <i>On the places of installation of their communication devices connected to communication lines located outside the territory of the Russian Federation</i> </li><li>  <i>About telecommunication message routes</i> </li><li>  <i>On the technical and software and infrastructure of its communication network.</i> </li></ul><br><h3>  Project ‚Ññ4 </h3><br>  ‚Äú <a href="https://regulation.gov.ru/p/91979">On approval of terms</a> , order, composition and format of provision by communication operators, owners or other owners of technological communication networks, by other persons when using communication lines crossing the State Border of the Russian Federation, information in electronic form about communication facilities ensuring interaction with such communication lines, including through other lines of communication. "  The basis for the development of: ‚ÄúClause 4 of Article 56.2 of the Federal Law of July 7, 2003 No. 126-FZ‚Äú On Communications ‚Äù‚Äù. <br><br>  Its essence is that communication operators, owners or other owners of technological communication networks, other persons, when using communication lines crossing the State Border of the Russian Federation, must provide information on communication media to the information system for monitoring and managing a public communication network in electronic form providing interaction with such communication lines, including through other communication lines.  Apparently, we are talking about the "second" page of the interactive form, all in the same information system.  In terms of all the same.  We quote: <br><br><blockquote>  "Owners of communication facilities are required to apply for authorization on the web service no later than November 15, 2019 and within 5 working days from the date of authorization to ensure the provision of information by filling in interactive forms in your account, and for newly commissioned communication facilities installed on communication lines crossing the State Border of the Russian Federation - no later than 15 working days from the date of commissioning of the relevant communication means and within 5 working days from the date of authorization ensure that the  teraktivnyh forms in a private office. " </blockquote><br><h3>  Project ‚Ññ5 </h3><br>  ‚Äú <a href="https://regulation.gov.ru/p/91981">On approval of the terms</a> , order, composition and format of providing owners or other owners of communication lines crossing the State Border of the Russian Federation, in electronic form, information on the purpose of using the communication line, as well as on the means of communication installed on the specified communication line‚Äù.  The basis for the development of: ‚ÄúClause 1 of Article 56.2 of the Federal Law of July 7, 2003 No. 126-FZ‚Äú On Communications ‚Äù‚Äù. <br><br>  The point is: the owners or other owners of the communication line crossing the border of the Russian Federation should share information, why they use such lines, for what purpose, as well as about the means of communication installed on such communication lines.  The form of submission and deadlines are the same as in previous projects, i.e.  November 15, 2019 <br><br>  All information in the Public Communication Network Monitoring and Management Center is updated as it becomes available.  The storage period for such information is unlimited. <br><br>  Recall, November 30 is marked "International Information Protection Day".  Now, probably, you can add to the calendar of especially important IT events on November 15, the birthday of Cheburnet. <br><br>  Although a weak hope that the laws will be finalized, still remains.  Just recently, a working group under the commission of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (RSPP) <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/26/06/2019/5d124dff9a7947ea9efbb977">found</a> in documents a threat to restrict access to the Runet. <br><br>  <b>What else is interesting in the blog <a href="https://www.cloud4y.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Darticle">Cloud4Y</a></b> <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/cloud4y/blog/454278/">Cyber ‚Äã‚Äãinsurance on the Russian market</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/cloud4y/blog/456866/">When will they make a ‚ÄúCheburnet‚Äù from the Internet: a review of the project</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/cloud4y/blog/454274/">Light, camera ... cloud: How clouds change the movie industry</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/cloud4y/blog/453612/">Football in the clouds - fashion or necessity?</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/cloud4y/blog/452880/">High-profile user data breaches in January - April 2019</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/457884/">https://habr.com/ru/post/457884/</a></p>
