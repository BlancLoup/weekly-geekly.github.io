Not a single hunter on the trail;  no fisherman breeding his asp;  not a single detective investigating the theft of a bra from a clothesline ... They all do not know even a hundredth of the excitement that a historian has when working with lists of people who have long gone. <br><br>  They are somewhere in the dark.  Invisible, inaudible and silent.  Forgotten by almost all the inhabitants of the Earth ‚Äî they have not been mnemoned for a long time <a href="http://fantlab.ru/work1282">, nor even by the Lilyshki</a> .  The lucky ones have a relative, in our stupid fussy age, for some reason, preoccupied with a "genecological tree."  Most don't even have this. <br><br>  You enter there, into this subtle blackness, alone.  You have no idea where to go.  All you have is a surname and initials.  Miserable property, to be honest.  Especially if the surname is Kuznetsov or Smirnov.  ‚ÄúTo have the surname Muller in Germany ...‚Äù, ord, ord.  But you go, simply because you are often here, and you know by touch familiar trails where you can hook on some kind of tail, smell some kind of trace.  You do not know how much you will wander, and you have no idea how you will go out - empty-handed, or bring a person to the light.

      Yes, still very few people interesting, but not indifferent to you.  And for some reason it is important to bring him to the light.  I do not know why.  Gorchev, who had already gone there for a long time, somehow wrote an essay that I couldn‚Äôt write under threat of execution.  You probably read it, <a href="http://gorchev.lib.ru/txt/by1/predn.shtml">about the destination</a> , and if you did not read it, then you are some strange people who rob themselves.  Well, yes, that very thing: <i>‚ÄúIn fact, it‚Äôs not very difficult to find out your Destiny: if a person does something just like that, not for money, and in general no one needs it at ***, then this means that the very thing is his true purpose</i> . <i>"</i>  I would not say so loudly, of course, but there is something in it. <br><br>  It's just ... They are all alone there, do you understand?  Quite quite.  And so find out about them, at least I. <br><br>  Well, if without romance and snot, then everything is very simple. <a name="habracut"></a>  NITU "MISIS", where I work, celebrates its centenary this year.  I, as a person who has a diploma from the Faculty of History in the bins, was assigned to deal with the history of the Moscow Mining Academy, which, in fact, started our university.  I began to understand - and suddenly I got carried away, and began to work no longer for work, but for myself.  I dug deep, as it is not required for an anniversary.  Now, in particular, in my spare time I am working through the lists of academy employees - I‚Äôm making up something like the MGA biographical dictionary.  This is the most primary elaboration of lists, draft.  Normal punching on the web. <br><br>  In general, the toolkit of a historian has recently become much more diverse.  Before what?  Previously, the library and the archive, the first and last place where you can find information about the past.  Without the archive and nowhere, but ... You do not even understand how much useful things over the past ten years, people have dragged into the Web.  At least, the primary search is quite possible, although the old people grumble about "your brehlivy unverifiable Internet." <br><br>  Listen, let me just tell you about one of the last "deduced"?  This is the easiest way to explain.  And in general, I will try to do something like a series of essays about students and teachers of the Moscow Mining Academy.  Painfully interesting people sometimes bring to the light. <br><br><h3>  Series One: The Farm. </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/447/e82/3fc/447e823fcd26ab4af43d5578f2a591bb.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Yazykovy.</i>  <i>1917</i> <br><br>  His last name was bad - Languages.  To make it clear: a good last name is Grebencha, for example.  Or mazing.  Or Lutzau.  Wonderful surname Lutzau, especially if the Cyrillic alphabet!  Immediately, everything will be dumped on you, that there is about it on the Net, practically without garbage. <br><br>  And Languages ‚Äã‚Äã... Well, not Popov, of course, but not much better.  Fifteen years ago my wife and I were bukhteli, that there is nothing in this vaunted Internet.  Since then, the problem has changed to the exact opposite - the Internet is really flooded with verbal garbage that just clogs up the search results, like dust and dirt - air filters.  And, having typed in the search for ‚ÄúLanguages ‚Äã‚Äãof VA‚Äù, you simply cannot get through student essays about a romantic poet and any ‚Äúsyntax of Romance LANGUAGES‚Äù. <br><br>  But it's not so bad.  Much worse that Languages ‚Äã‚ÄãV.A.  not from teachers, but from AHC.  The head of the administration of the Moscow Mining Academy in the list in 1923, to be exact.  And this is almost a guaranteed "drain the water."  There are quite a lot of scientists left, and more from techies than from humanities - they remember their works longer and cite more often.  From accountants and caretakers nothing remains.  What should they leave forever?  Passed balances?  Issued outfits?  Well, the benefits of searching, frankly, is questionable.  Well, what interesting can descendants please head AHC? <br><br>  In general, I tried to pull him out of the darkness just for the sake of order.  And according to the catalogs of the Russian State Library, the name struck just for the sake of conscience. <br><br>  Oops!  And what is such a net for us? <br><br>  Quite a lot of texts fell on the VA Languages, but four books almost certainly belonged to ‚Äúour‚Äù Yazykov from the Mining Academy, where, as we know, there were only three faculties - mining, geological, and metallurgical.  These are the books ‚ÄúNew method of producing low-carbon ferrochrome‚Äù of 1933, ‚ÄúReceiving ferrochrome from the Ural ores‚Äù and the textbook ‚ÄúElectrometallurgy of iron‚Äù of 1932.  The fourth book is the fat Talmud of 1934 of the edition <a href="https://search.rsl.ru/ru/record/01005314191">‚ÄúFerroalloys: Theory and Practice of Smelting Ferroalloys in Electric Furnaces‚Äù</a> , by Grigorovich KP, Bogolyubov VA, Elyutin VP, Samarin AM, Yazykov V. BUT.  Specifically Languages ‚Äã‚ÄãV.A.  wrote sections "Ferromanganese" and "Ferrosilicon". <br><br>  To make it clear to people who are not related to metallurgy - at least three names in this list are known to every MISA graduate.  These are the classics, titans and demigods.  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587,_%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD_%25D0%259F%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">Grigorovich</a> - the creator of the national school of electrometallurgy, demiurge-co-author.  All the rest are his students, recent students of MGA. <br><br>  Already in the forties, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD,_%25D0%2590%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D1%2580_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B8%25D1%2585%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">Samarin</a> would become an academician, then a metallurgical scientist No. 1, director of the Institute of Metallurgy named after A.A.  Baykova Academy of Sciences of the USSR.  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2595%25D0%25BB%25D1%258E%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD,_%25D0%2592%25D1%258F%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2_%25D0%259F%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">Elyutin</a> , while remaining a good scholar, would prefer an administrative path.  He will be among the ministers and will steer higher education in the Land of Soviets for more than 30 years, from 54 to 85 years.  The late Soviet system of higher education, the return of which now does not require only the most lazy Tiputat - his brainchild, he created and fostered. <br><br>  But what is written about the book itself in the fundamental research ‚ÄúScientific schools of MISiS‚Äù: <i>‚ÄúIn 1932 the book of K.P.</i>  <i>Grigorovich ‚ÄúProduction of steel in electric furnaces‚Äù, which became the main textbook for students of electrometallurgists, and two years later, he and his students, A.M.</i>  <i>Samarin, V.P.</i>  <i>Elyutin, V.A.</i>  <i>Language, V.Ya.</i>  <i>Bogolyubov - released the first textbook on the production of ferroalloys "</i> . <br><br>  Ok so.  The caretaker and one of the authors of the first textbook on the production of ferroalloys.  Not weak such a book and not weak such a neighborhood.  But who are you, the mysterious languages ‚Äã‚Äãof VA? <br><br>  Unfortunately, there was nothing else.  Attempts to sift the garbage falling out on a general request did not bring anything - I flipped through hundreds of pages of links, killed three hours, found nothing, got furious, and said stopitsot bad words to the nasty creators of nasty banks of essay essays. <br><br>  In general, I went to look for other names on the list, but I put Yazykov in memory.  The usual situation is - he grabbed his tail, was delighted, but the tail twisted out of his hands and slipped into the burrow.  A thousand times it was and ten thousand more will be.  Go already work, whiner! <br><br>  And I worked.  But I put a bookmark on Yazykov in the brain.  And then in one source connected with the Mining Academy, I suddenly come across a mention of ‚ÄúLanguages ‚Äã‚ÄãVal.  Al-dr. <br><br>  I already shook with excitement, though ... How-how his name? <br><br>  Punching " <i>Languages ‚Äã‚ÄãValery Alexandrovich</i> ." <br><br>  Is empty. <br><br>  Punching " <i>Languages ‚Äã‚ÄãValentin Alexandrovich</i> ." <br><br>  Is empty. <br><br>  Pancake!  Angry.  Other options do not occur.  I commemorate the kind quiet word "Krivorukov sokradalkina."  I think.  I swear.  You moron, Vadim Yuryevich, you lose the qualification completely.  What could be Valery Aleksandrovich at the end of the XIX, beginning of the XX century?  We stuff: <br><br>  ‚Äú <i>I-Zy-kov Va-le-ri-en Alec-san ...</i> ‚Äù <br><br>  There is!  There are languages ‚Äã‚ÄãValerian Aleksandrovich!  And not even one link! <br><br>  In general, I was lucky.  Valerian Alexandrovich had the same caring relative, who for some reason was <a href="https://www.geni.com/people/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD-%25D0%25AF%25D0%25B7%25D1%258B%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2/6000000029659199515">concerned with his ancestors</a> .  And even <a href="http://www.yazikoff.ru/text/yazikovy.html">posted photos</a> .  Information about him is not very much - only the story of his stepmother, who wrote in the late 50s.  at the request of the Council of the old Bolsheviks at the Kostroma city committee of the CPSU about their husband and his elder sons, his stepsons - active participants in the establishment of Soviet power in the city of Kostroma.  But here the claw is stuck - the whole bird is a chasm, even in a brief biography there is a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãclues by which you can search further. <br><br>  Common in general, was the story.  Who cares, listen. <br><br>  Valerian Alexandrovich was born in the family of Alexander Alexandrovich and Sophia Innokentievna Yazykovyh.  His parents were professional revolutionaries.  Here they are: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a60/274/876/a602748760f426d9a1e90e02fcc1ac6c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Sofya Innokentievna Yazykova (Muromova)</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/489/1e1/247/4891e12474d33fb55393426f4b2c9638.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Alexander Alexandrovich Languages.</i>  <i>April 1897</i> <br><br>  It should be said that there were quite a lot of such ‚Äúsecond generation revolutionaries‚Äù in the Mining Academy - the same Fadeev was the same son of the convinced ‚Äúministers of the Revolution‚Äù.  All these populists, raznochintsy and other black peredeltsy by the 17th managed not only to give birth, but also raise children.  Children who went to the Revolution at the age of 15-16, and then became the most sincere servants of the world's first State of Justice.  Those who survived, of course. <br><br>  Valeryan grew up with his younger brother-pogodka, Alexander Alexandrovich younger.  Here they are small. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/324/d2f/963/324d2f963513a58380854848c583a2c0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But older, already high school students. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb6/af0/db4/cb6af0db4e8cff1fff8dc03001f949db.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Mother died of consumption, when the eldest was three, and the youngest two.  We lived on suitcases.  Father, like all the "unreliable", all the time shook the empire ‚Äî now links, then relocations on the instructions of the party: Petersburg, Odessa, Ilimsk, Irkutsk ... After serving the link, my father left for Batum and married the second time the medical revolutionary.  And it started a new way: Batum, Tiflis, Kharkov, Baku ... Then the father already had tuberculosis, moved to the Persian Mashhad, a few years there, returning to Odessa, sending the father to Kostroma, where they finally settled.  Six years lived separately - a father with his elder sons in Kostroma, a stepmother with four children in Tiraspol, gathered only in the 14th. <br><br>  Then the war, defeatism, the contempt of the patriots ... Then the 17th, February, revolution, red bows ... L. Nevskaya wrote in memoirs: <i>"In March, after the February Revolution, members of the group came to the gymnasium with red bows political circle - the Yazykov brothers, A. Gusakovsky and G. Kravkov ‚Äù</i> .  Sons go to the revolution with the head, starting with the aforementioned party circle of students, led by his father.  By the way, in March of the 17th both brothers were already members of the party.  Here they are, red boys and girls, recent high school students, in the summer of one thousand nine hundred and seventeenth in the provincial city of Kostroma. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/756/ac0/12a/756ac012ac498b0fe78750f077b00df7.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>The younger one is second from the left in the middle row, Valerian is the rightmost in the middle row.</i> <br><br>  Then everything is just like everyone else - demonstrations, maydays, <i>‚Äúhostile whirlwinds‚Äù</i> , agitation and propaganda, party work among the masses, contempt for the Cadets and Octobrists, party discussions with the Social Revolutionaries and anarchists. <br><br>  October, the revolution, stretched to the limit of the string.  Now the country will burst and fly away ... <br><br>  Burst. <br><br>  <i>"Any revolution is only then worth something when it is able to defend itself ..."</i> .  Here is our former circle in the autumn of the 17th.  The braids were mercilessly sheared, the gymnasium uniform with contempt was removed, it was replaced by tunics and hats. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/864/0a4/748/8640a4748bbd073963b0008484648e91.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Valerian Yazykov - in the foreground, lies.</i> <br><br>  Boys and girls have become adept at party discussions, but what will be worth a thousand words when hand strength is important?  The fracture check was not long in coming.  In July 1918, the Yaroslavl mutiny, and the brothers Valerian and Alexander went to the Civil War. <br><br>  Valeryan was the head of the horse intelligence, fought in Dievo-Gorodishche.  <i>"Come on, checkers podvys, we were all born in battles, we were all born in battles ...".</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/494/f3a/690/494f3a690958ebeafa87dfce541412a3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>"The glorious massacre of the Red Army with Boris Savinkov in Yaroslavl in July 1918."</i>  <i>Lubok, 1926.</i> <br><br>  Not only survived, but also a little matured, became the Chief of the Latvian Squad - that was his official title.  When he returned, his hometown met him unkindly - in Kostroma, the power was captured by the ‚Äúleft SR of Boilers with a gang of thugs,‚Äù and did not want to put along with one more, as they would say today, ‚Äúfield commander‚Äù.  Once Valeryan was nearly strangled by an assassin who had climbed through an open window at night.  But Valeryan had his own people, who had returned with him from near Yaroslavl, and as a result, the linguistic thugs turned out to be stronger than the Kotlovsk ones.  The boilers were arrested, and Valerian took him to Moscow and surrendered to the Kremlin. <br><br>  Do not have time to deal with the rebellion, the new attack - Kolchak.  And in the fall of 18, Kostromichi was conducted on the Kolchak front of the Exemplary Kostroma 56th Regiment, Valeryan was appointed as a commissar.  <i>"Dashing carts took us into battle, the legends tell us what we were ...".</i> <br><br>  In October 19th, not a romantic young man returned to Kostroma, but a seasoned veteran, melted in three waters, bathed in three bloods, boiled in three liquors.  And he is not alone.  All are back.  Those who survived. <br><br>  Here they are, the surviving members of the Civil Circle.  I love to look at these matured boys and shorn girls.  I do not know why. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/581/deb/83d/581deb83dcf7b4b51e2867e6a415e00c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Valerian - right</i> <br><br>  But not all survived.  Alexander Alexandrovich Jr., even after the insurrection, left for Moscow, from there to St. Petersburg, where he was elected a political commissar of the regiment.  He went to the ground near Voronezh, in August 1919, in a battle under the Liski station, where the Cossacks crowded the Red forces.  The father, seeing him off in Moscow, said: "If you are captured, do not give up, they will take the skin off of you."  He did just that - being surrounded, he shot himself.  He is nineteen forever. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ff/910/bf4/9ff910bf43f93c5b3212c0a469ace45b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Two Aleksandrov Aleksandrovich Language.</i>  <i>June 27, 1919 Moscow, before the departure of the Younger to the Southern Front.</i> <br><br>  Father, having received the news, almost went crazy.  He quit his job and spent almost the whole winter alone in the little house, on the outer wall of which the inscription from the naive and bright times of the circle - ‚ÄúLight of the Communards‚Äù remained.  Then he got himself together and in the spring of the 20th year he left for Moscow.  My father‚Äôs connections, like all the old Bolsheviks, had a carriage.  He spent several years, still in Baku, worked with L. B.  Krasin, who is now the people's commissar of trade and industry.  In a special album, Yazykov Sr. kept autographs of Lenin, Gorky and other prominent Bolsheviks.  Therefore, Alexander Alexandrovich did not remain without work.  The party decided to use it on the international line - Alexander Alexandrovich was sent by Lenin to a conference on disarmament in America, he returned in 1922, in 1924 he was appointed Soviet consul general in Canada, in general, he worked in the foreign policy field. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ed/84a/c77/0ed84ac77fd8571abe1b971dd533ea20.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Valeryan same Political Department of the Red Army, commanded to study engineering, giving direction to the Moscow Mining Academy.  I have already mentioned about the academy, it really was a unique educational institution, some kind of ‚Äúred Hogwarts‚Äù.  It was very hungry and cold there, but miracles happened at every turn - the first-year student, for example, became the vice-rector, replacing the official millionaire in this post. <br><br>  We know little about Valeryan‚Äôs life at MGA ... More precisely, I would certainly like to know more. <br><br>  It is known that he almost immediately got married, here is his photo with the first wife. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee0/595/58d/ee059558d3c918a026bae7971b1aa2cf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  While still studying twice (1922 and 1924) he was elected to the Moscow City Council.  In general, he was very actively involved in both social and party work.  Like other party students, he did not get out of the Zamoskvoretsky District Party Committee, to which the university was geographically attached.  The district committee rules the famous Zemlyachka.  The same one - politkatorzhanka, commissar with the party nickname "Demon", "executioner of Crimea", the first woman awarded the Order of the Red Banner and other, other, other ... <br><br>  In general, of course, the company in MGA and the surrounding area was exceptional then - no man, no legend.

Kuybyshev, then the deputy director of the Moscow Petroleum Institute.  In 1928 he studied in graduate school at the Institute of Geology and Mineralogy of the Communist Academy, worked as head of various expeditions, then moved to Leningrad with the Central Research Institute of Geology, where he first became deputy director and then director of this institute. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/012/4b5/537/0124b553760eab5b3891962f746a2707.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Here it is at this time, in March 1934. <br><br>  The thirties began, and in Leningrad it becomes very uncomfortable.  The clouds are gathering, and Valeryan is transferred to Moscow, to the People's Commissariat for Ordzhonikidze, who, like many of his classmates, knew from college students.  He was appointed head of the USSR Commissariat Narkomtyazhproma.  At the same time he met his new wife Tatiana, who <i>"was free after the divorce, but he is unhappy in his first marriage</i> . <i>"</i>  The wife later wrote memories ‚ÄúMy family, which is not,‚Äù which I have not yet found. <br><br>  But the persecution did not stop.  Molotov himself in 1936 published an article in the Bolshevik, in which he called Yazykov a <i>‚Äúpest with a party membership card‚Äù</i> .  The intercession did not help either Ordzhonikidze or Zemlyachka.  January 21, 1937 Valerian Aleksandrovich Yazykov was arrested.  Here is his last photo - from the investigation file.  He is 39 years old here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9c6/377/51d/9c637751d378f19ac0369f9aae3188df.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On September 9, 1937, Valerian Yazykov, Russian, higher education, member of the CPSU (b), was found guilty of participating in an anti-Soviet Trotskyite center by the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR. <br><br>  The sentence was executed on the same day.  Burial place - Moscow, Don cemetery.  Rehabilitated February 18, 1956 <br><br>  That's the whole story.  Of course, this is only a draft, contour, sketch.  We do not know much.  How are geology and metallurgy combined in his biography?  What did he get under the ax for?  Of course, most likely - he was an active Trotskyist, like many of the past Civilians, but this too needs to be clarified.  In general, a lot of things need to be clarified, in an amicable way, further we must already go to the archives, stir things up.  To raise published texts in libraries, in general - to dig a biography seriously. <br><br>  But it is unlikely.  Hardly anyone will dig in earnest.  Not the marshal and not the minister.  An ordinary person, a common destiny, a trivial biography, in general, for those times.  I‚Äôm definitely not going to - I‚Äôm doing a rough sifting and there is still a long list ahead.  But somehow, a Bolshevik Valerian Yazykov, shot down on takeoff, scratched me and did not become an academician or a people's commissar.  Scrabbled. <br><br>  The sands of time bring everything slowly but surely.  The masses have long forgotten not only Colonel Perkhurov, but also the Yaroslavl insurgency as such.  But what to say - and Savinkov‚Äôs created ‚ÄúUnion for the Defense of the Motherland and Freedom‚Äù was remembered only because of the latest novel about Fandorin.  No one cares about the party discussions, or the fight against the Trotskyists, or by and large, until the revolution itself.  The anniversary passed - and thank God.  Not under the Communists, thank God, we live, ‚ÄúThe History of the CPSU‚Äù no longer needs to be taught.  <i>"From the heroes of bygone days, sometimes there are no names left ...".</i> <br><br>  Time erases everything, and the farther, the better.  And this ... This is just a small piece of a huge mosaic, which I for some reason cleared. <br><br>  And now he showed you. <br><br>  Who's next on the list?  <i>‚ÄúVI Pukhov, Assistant Head of the Administration of the MGA‚Äù ...</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371381/">https://habr.com/ru/post/371381/</a></p>
