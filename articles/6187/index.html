In other words, the registrant or registrar who updated the information no later than March 31, 2007, receives as a reward two months of prepaid domain name validity in the domain KIEV.UA.

      All domain names in the KIEV.UA domain that have undergone the data updating procedure from April 1, 2007 to April 30, 2007, inclusive, will work until June 30, 2008, inclusive, at no additional charge.  In other words, the registrant or registrar, who updated the information no later than April 30, 2007, receives as a remuneration one month of prepaid domain name validity in the domain KIEV.UA. <br><br>  Domain names in the KIEV.UA domain that have passed the data updating procedure from May 1, 2007 to May 31, 2007 inclusive, will be open until May 31, 2008 inclusive, at no additional charge. <br><br>  Domain names in the KIEV.UA domain that did not pass the data updating procedure until May 31, 2007 inclusive, from June 1, 2007 are transferred to the HOLD state.  For another two months, domain registrants will still be able to recover the registered domain name. <br><br>  If the domain name information is not updated by the registrant by August 01, 2007, the delegation will be canceled and the domain will be free for new registration. <br><br>  If your domain name is serviced by a registrar, then contact him with a request to update information on your domain name. <br><br>  If you have registered the domain yourself, in order to update the data in the domain you need: <br><br>  On the main page <a href="http://www.hostmaster.net.ua/">www.hostmaster.net.ua</a> in the left column, select the link Search for Registrant Domains " <br>  Enter your nic-handle and enter the password <br>  A list of domains in which you are an administrative or technical contact will appear on the screen. <br>  Select the domain, the data about which you want to update, and click "Update". <br>  The screen will display current information about your domain and four buttons: <br>  DELETE - to delete a domain.  After clicking this button, a domain deletion request will be automatically generated. <br><br>  According to the DELETE application, an email will be sent to the address of the administrative contact of the domain from the UANIC registration system with a request to confirm the deletion.  According to the instructions contained in the letter, the administrative contact of the domain can either send a confirmation by e-mail, or enter a confirmation via the web form, the link to which is also indicated in the letter. <br><br>  Application confirmation is expected within 5 business days. <br><br>  If the removal request is not confirmed within 5 business days, the domain will not be deleted. <br><br>  You can check domain deletion at <a href="http://www.hostmaster.net.ua/">www.hostmaster.net.ua</a> via the link ‚ÄúSearch for domain‚Äù.

According to the instructions contained in the letter, the administrative contact of the domain can either send a confirmation by e-mail, or enter a confirmation via the web form, the link to which is also indicated in the letter. <br><br>  Application confirmation is expected within 5 business days. <br><br>  If the application for a change of administrative contact does not receive confirmation within 5 business days, the changes will not take effect and the domain will not be updated. <br><br>  You can check the change of the administrative contact of the domain on the website <a href="http://www.hostmaster.net.ua/">www.hostmaster.net.ua</a> using the link ‚ÄúSearch for a domain‚Äù.  A sign of a change in information about an administrative contact is the new value of the "admin-c" field. <br><br>  MODIFY - to make changes to the technical data on the domain.  After pressing this button, an already completed application form will appear on the screen, to which you can make the necessary changes.  After making changes, press the "SEND" button.  The application is sent for processing. <br><br>  Within an hour, you and other contact persons specified in the ‚Äúold‚Äù domain registration data will receive an email from the UANIC registration system with a request to confirm the changes.  According to the instructions contained in the letter, you can either send a confirmation by e-mail, or enter a confirmation via the web form, the link to which is also indicated in the letter. <br><br>  Application confirmation is expected within 5 business days. <br><br>  If the change request is not confirmed within 5 business days, the change will not take effect and the domain will not be updated. <br><br>  Keep unchanged - if there is no need for changes.  After clicking this button, an application will be automatically generated to update the domain. <br><br>  Within an hour, you and other contact persons specified in the ‚Äúold‚Äù domain registration data will receive an email from the UANIC registration system with a request to confirm the changes.

A sign of completion of the information update is the value of the ‚Äústatus‚Äù field, the date of which should be 2008. <br><br>  If you use a domain, but have not received a message about the need to update information in the domain, then formally you do not have a relationship with this domain.  In this case, we strongly recommend that you contact the person who registered the domain for you and request that you enter your information in the administrative contact of the domain. <br><br>  We also strongly recommend that when updating data in the domain, check the list of contact persons who may make changes, and exclude those who are not related to your domain. <br><br>  hostmaster.net.ua </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/6187/">https://habr.com/ru/post/6187/</a></p>
