Not so long ago it was for this purpose that I chose a device with which I would be comfortable to handle and who in this regard could support me (of course, not only that was required from him: the price and other functions were taken into account) throughout the day.  The choice fell on the <strong>Nokia 5530</strong> (about which, to my surprise, I did not really see anything at habr).  I would like to consider a few controversial and unclear points about managing your work schedule through this device. <br><br><h3>  How am I going to plan my time and what do I need for this? </h3><br>  Because of the loose graphics, I can‚Äôt paint my plans by the hour, thereby driving myself into a frame.  Therefore, I need to have an exemplary to-do list for each day so that it is always in front of me and I have access to it from both the PC and the phone (that is, all information was not stored on the media, but on the network), but I also wanted would receive reminders of some of the things / activities.  Of course, there shouldn't be any confusion in this, and everything should be extremely simple and convenient.  Therefore, I refused the usual built-in calendar right away. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h3>  Services through which we ‚Äúmanage time‚Äù </h3><br>  At the moment there are many of the most convenient services that provide us to maintain ToDo lists, schedules, shopping lists and the like. <br><ul><li>  <em>Has I done?</em> </li><li>  <em>Google calendar</em> <br><h6>  ( <em>Google Tasks</em> could have been included here, but I don‚Äôt know about their work together) </h6></li><li>  <em>Evernote</em> </li><li>  <em>Remember the Milk</em> </li><li>  <em>Twitter</em> <br><h6>  (in its own way also represents a ‚Äútodo list‚Äù) </h6></li></ul><br>  Probably, nevertheless, the most important service from this list will be <em><u>everyone doing?</u></em>  because  to a certain extent, he connects all the rest with each other: it is enough to call the number and say exactly where to add the note (Evernote, RTM, Twitter), or use the tudo list provided by the service itself.  Recording is certainly convenient, but there is no to-do list and I can edit it only when I have a PC at my disposal.  However, a certain reminder system is present: e-mail (requires constant connection of the box on the phone, which drives the battery and traffic) or SMS (especially did not go into details, but it seems like a paid account is required).  Of course, there is no question of a Symbian s60v5 client.

      <em><u>Google Calendar</u></em> guarantees us complete control over time and in combination with Nokia‚Äôs regular calendar, it seems to be friendly, but I‚Äôm not very clear about the moments with synchronization specifically on my phone, and therefore there‚Äôs an article about the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/nokia/68033/">Nokia 5800 (and others on Symbian 9 .x) - Synchronize your calendar and contacts with Google Calendar and Gmail</a> . <br>  The question is whether <em><u>Google Tasks is</u></em> attributed here, and if so, what to do next? <br>  However, this option still creates a small confusion in the affairs (IMHO). <br><br>  For <em><u>Evernote,</u></em> there is no client on Simba at all, but there is a mobile version that is slightly unpleasant.  You can send notes either through the mail (there is a plus in this), can I do it with the help <em>?</em>  But viewing all this is extremely inconvenient (only through a browser or using a PC) and there is no reminder function, although for large notes it‚Äôs probably an indispensable thing. <br><br>  With the <em><u>Remember the Milk</u></em> faced not so long ago, so it is difficult to say what's what.  What is clear is that the todo list wins here compared to other services, but there is no client, the moments with reminders and synchronization are unclear.  As such a test service did not hold, and even plainly and did not use.  Is there support from <em>everyone?</em>  (but in my opinion requires a paid account). <br><br>  About <em><u>Twitter,</u></em> little can be said, because  his purpose is still different, although you can keep small notes and tasks for yourself there (there are no questions with clients). <br><br><h3>  Total </h3><br>  The best option at the moment I do not see.  The problem is that, as such, clients do not manufacture simbian (and, moreover, s60v5), and the services themselves have disadvantages (or rather, do not have the advantages of neighboring services). <br><br>  Waiting for proposals and additions on this issue, in order to come to the best solution. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/71245/">https://habr.com/ru/post/71245/</a></p>
