  <section class="page js-page"><h1>MNP: Throw off the chains properly</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c04/dd2/6dc/c04dd26dc5ebff83ca85a3e52eb638f7.jpg"><br>  It so happened that I had to take an active part in the implementation and implementation of number transfer service (MNP) from one of the regional telecom operators.  On Habr√© already appeared articles devoted to this topic, but they did not touch upon an important question: what kind of problems do subscribers face when transferring numbers and how to avoid them?  In addition, as the practice of three months has shown since the abolition of mobile slavery, subscribers do not fully understand what they are dealing with.  Below, I will describe the most common problems, as well as features of the number transfer, which not everyone knows. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  Discrepancy of personal data </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d58/455/720/d58455720eb0b1b526b3014124b06c8a.jpg"><br>  This is the most commonplace and at the same time the most common mistake that the subscriber makes.  Before transferring the number, make sure that the donor operator has the most current information about your personal data.  Full name, series and number of the document proving the identity, as well as the address of registration.  When you apply for the transfer of the number to the recipient operator, it will send the mentioned personal data to the donor operator.  If at least something does not match, then the donor has the right to refuse to transfer the number. <br>  Some operators even consider the difference in the letters "e" and "e".  Therefore, if you are, for example, called ‚ÄúArtem‚Äù, then you should contact your current operator with the requirement to record your name in their database according to your passport, i.e.  through the letter "e".  Even if you have the simplest name, you should check that it is recorded without typos in the base of the donor.  To do this, call the contact center or use your personal account. <br><br><h4>  You can not change the operator more than once every 70 days </h4><br>  Some subscribers, having become disillusioned with the new operator, want to switch to another or return to the previous one.  Remember that the operator can be changed again only after 70 days.  In this case, any attempts to transfer numbers will be rejected by the Operator of the Central Database of Transferred Numbers (TSDDPN). <br>  Some of the most cunning subscribers who want to return to the previous operator without waiting for 70 days proceed as follows.  Cancel the contract with the current operator, at the same time the transferred number returns to the original operator, and then run to it with the request to connect this number to them.  This, of course, is possible, but remember that not every operator is ready to restore your number in this way.  Therefore, before doing so, check with the operator - if he can renew your number.

    <h4>  Pay debts </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f41/c86/dff/f41c86dffbde62013e29dfb5ac756f06.jpg"><br>  After the subscriber receives an SMS notification that the number transfer is approved, he thinks that now you can not pay the current operator.  This is not true.  The fact is that even after the transfer has already taken place, the donor operator has the right to demand from the recipient operator to suspend the maintenance of the fugitive debtor.  In this case, the subscriber will have 10 days to repay the debt.  If the debt to the donor is not repaid, the service will be suspended. <br><br><h4>  Renewal of the contract to another person </h4><br>  When the number is transferred to another operator, this does not mean that the operator becomes its owner.  The operator does not have the right to connect this number to persons who have not written the relevant application for transfer.  Some operators still sin by selling numbers to other people, thereby putting them at risk.  As I wrote above, for the number can be counted the duty of the donor operator.  If you, for example, bought a beautiful transferred number from a stranger through reissuing a contract, you may find yourself in a situation where you will either have to part with the number or pay the stranger‚Äôs debts. <br><br><h4>  Hang transfer </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3e0/b08/bcc/3e0b08bcc0215d51edde7ff3c1969557.jpg"><br>  When the transfer time comes, the donor operator first disconnects the number, and then the recipient operator connects it to himself.  This procedure usually takes a few minutes.  But there may be a situation when the donor has already released the number, and for some reason the recipient has not connected it.  The subscriber is without communication.  I observed situations when the connection was absent for several days.  Therefore, if you decide to transfer the number, you should think about what you will do in this situation.  It is worth stocking up with an alternative SIM card. <br><br><h4>  Cancel Transfer </h4><br>  If you applied for a transfer, and then changed your mind, then you can write an application to cancel the transfer.  And you can do this both with the donor operator and the recipient operator.  The main thing to remember is that you can cancel a transfer no later than three days before the transfer date. <br><br><h4>  Other operators and external payment systems </h4><br>  When you transfer a number from one operator to another, other operators, as well as external payment systems (banks, terminals) will not know about it immediately.  Information about transfers is updated every two hours.  Therefore, during these two hours it is possible that subscribers of other operators will not be able to reach you.  And replenishing the balance by number through the terminals is not earlier than after 2 hours, otherwise the money can go to the donor operator. <br><br><h4>  <b>Afterword</b> </h4><br>  I hope the above tips will help those who want to change the operator to do it without any problems.  I just want to add finally that after three months of practice, the operators, having stepped on many of the rakes of this process, have begun to jointly finalize the rules for the provision of number portability services.  Therefore, in the future, we can expect subscribers to diminish problems. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/263/c49/bf2/263c49bf2f47fa98673a8ab5b9cb86b0.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/219129/">https://habr.com/ru/post/219129/</a></p>
