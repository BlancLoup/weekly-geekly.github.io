  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The relevance of the PaaS model for electronic document management systems</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Quite a lot has already been said about the model ‚ÄúSED in the SaaS format‚Äù.  Recall that since about 2010, players began to appear in the Russian market creating new products and solutions in this format.  They set the trend.  By 2011-2012, several large players entered the market with SaaS-solutions for project management, which included, among other things, elements of financial systems, CRM and electronic document management systems.  These solutions are not directly SED in the SaaS format, but at the same time they partially solve the problems of modern SED and even allow automating the company's unique business processes in one form or another. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The model "EDS in the SaaS format" and the model "EDS in the On-premise format" (local implementation of EDS at the customer's facilities) have advantages and differences applicable to the requirements for the EDS and the type of customer according to the number of users.  If we talk about the main advantages of the SaaS model, then they are more applicable to micro enterprises and small business companies, because  money and time are saved for purchasing equipment and additional software, negotiations, testing, implementation and configuration.  Choosing such a model, the customer will see the application at work already during the test operation period, the implementation time will be much less. <br><br>  The downsides are that the EDMS in the SaaS model is usually poorly customized for the unique requirements of the company, since  only the supplier has access to the ‚Äúfine‚Äù settings and codes.  In particular, if in the process the customer decides to transfer the decision to his capacity, the decision will be nontrivial.

      The advantages of On-Premise EDMS are in the security of data storage in the local network compared to SaaS.  Modern On-Premise EDMS have much richer functionality than SaaS counterparts, have built-in BPM-modules, built-in applications that allow you to customize typical and unique business processes of the company to varying requirements. <br><br>  Schematically, the comparison of EDS in SaaS, on-premise (local implementation) and SaaS analogues can be represented as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d50/74e/fe3/d5074efe392549ee992bcbb4afcade40.jpg"><br><br>  Is it possible to build a solution that would include the indisputable advantages of local on-premise implementation of SED - such as reliable storage and data protection, rich SED functionality, and at the same time include the advantages of SaaS solutions - such as fast commissioning speed , personal demo access, ready-made functional solution for document flow, and still low cost of ownership compared to on-premise? <br>  This question is answered by the Director General of the company " <a href="http://andoc.ru/">Andok</a> " with his new decision " <a href="http://andoc.ru/decision/docsvision">Docsvision HYBRID</a> ".  This is a solution for automating workflow and business processes in the PaaS (Platform as Service) model based on our platform, which was released in June 2016. <br>  Not long ago, Anton Anikin, CEO of Andoc, <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/saas-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE-%25D1%2583%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258E-%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC-%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B-%25D0%25B2-%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5-iaas-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582-%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4">talked</a> about the Docsvision in the Cloud service - access to the EDS in the SaaS model, which provides full-fledged work with a ready-made solution in a dedicated virtual environment.  A new approach - EDMS in the PaaS model - has found its expression in a separate solution that will reduce costs while maintaining a high level of reliability and availability of EDMS. <br><br>  How does such a model meet the realities and has a chance of success?  This is the main question, the answer to which time will show and, perhaps, the readers will be prompted in the comments to this post after they have read a short interview.  There are no similar proposals on the market for solving the problems of document circulation, despite the fact that there is a growing demand from potential customer companies.  The format is new.  Who benefits from such a model and why, the comparison of three different models, the value curve - if you are interested, we suggest you to read it! <br><br><h1>  On the composition of the proposal </h1><br>  The service includes 3 components: built-in standard solution, Docsvision property licenses and virtual infrastructure for rent. <br><ul><li>  Licenses Docsvision client acquires the property, and does not receive a lease - and this is one of the differences PaaS from SaaS-solutions. </li><li>  The virtual infrastructure is located in data processing centers in Russia, at least Tier III level.  One of the data centers in Moscow has all three Tier III category certificates from the Uptime Institute, which confirms the maximum reliability and high quality of the services provided at the international level.  VMWare software, best in class from Gartner, is used for virtualization.  The infrastructure is built on NetApp. So, according to Gartner, NetApp capabilities are best suited for server virtualization solutions.  The speed of data transfer to the Internet from the infrastructure reaches 100 Mbps.  The increase in this speed can be discussed with the manager.  The speed of transmission over the networks inside the virtual infrastructure is not limited and is limited only by the physical network built on the 10 Gbit / s technology.  From periodic payments by the client, only the rent of the virtual infrastructure is paid. </li><li>  A typical solution is completely ready for work and configured in a virtual infrastructure, and after deployment it immediately gives all the possibilities for automating work with documents and business processes.  Among the possibilities are the automation of contractual activities, meetings, ‚Äúoffice‚Äù, the archive, work with tasks and assignments and many other functions.  Physically, a typical solution is a virtual machine with preinstalled OS, DBMS, Docsvision, EDS, additional applications and other software. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2e7/f50/42d/2e7f5042d6dc40e0aea6b5f078fc2654.jpg"><br><br><h1>  By cost of ownership of EDS which model is more profitable and why? </h1><br>  According to our estimates, for small, medium-sized businesses and microenterprises that do not have their own capacities for locating EDS, the cost of owning an EDS as part of the service ‚ÄúDocsvision HYBRID‚Äù is lower than the cost of owning a similar local solution on client capacities (on-premise), and - on the horizon from the year - lower than the cost of ownership of SaaS-SED, and here's why: <br><br>  1. Typical solution does not require implementation, because  It is deployed in a virtual infrastructure with a ready-made set of presets for instant start and solution of applied tasks of the company's document management in a matter of weeks.  There is no need to install an operating system, additional software (for example, to raise SQL Server and Mail Server), EDS, additional applications, and perform a number of other works, in the way it should be done when locally deployed at the customer‚Äôs facilities. <br>  2. If we talk about the benefits to the SaaS model (EDS in the cloud or for rent), then it is achieved on the horizon of owning the ERMS from the year due to the fact that, from periodic payments, the PaaS model provides only the rent of virtual infrastructure, in contrast to the SaaS, where In the periodic payments are also laid out the rental of licenses and solutions. <br>  3. If a company of medium or large business already has its own capacities and a strong revision of the SED is required for the company's business processes, then in this case it is more expedient to immediately deploy the SED locally at its own facilities.  For microenterprises or small enterprises that are interested in a minimum investment at the start to enter the EDS, SaaS-EDS with periodic payments and rental of licenses, solutions and infrastructure may be more appropriate. <br><br><h1>  How did the PaaS model become aware? </h1><br>  It was in the air.  Practice shows: the client today does not have time to understand and learn the nuances.  He needs to openly show examples and solutions, all calculations and advantages, so that he can immediately evaluate everything.  It is in this form that we present the PaaS solution to our potential customers. <br>  For example, let's take one of the requests from the customer to Andoc for the introduction of a SED with ‚Äúrecipes‚Äù for each requirement.  Such requests led us to develop the service. <br><br><h1>  Client request parameters and suggested responses </h1><br>  1. A <i>company with the number of future users of EDS in 50 people.</i> <br><br>  2. <i>The requirements for the functionality of the future EDS are the automation of contractual activities, the automation of meetings, the office and the archive, the control of executive discipline.</i> <br><br>  Docsvision HYBRID includes a typical solution with pre-installed EDS, Document Management, Contracts, Meetings applications and a number of additional settings and presets that solve the initial tasks of the client. <br><br>  3. <i>According to the requirements, the EDS should be launched in a short time within one month.</i> <br><br>  Standard delivery of the Service ‚ÄúDocsvision HYBRID‚Äù provided for by the contract is up to two weeks. <br><br>  4. The <i>director of IT (customer contact) had previously worked with Docsvision.</i>  <i>The functionality of the system suits the customer.</i>  <i>At the same time, the company does not have a dedicated budget and time to purchase servers, and specialists for entering servers and setting up software for a project are busy on other projects for several months in advance.</i>  <i>In the future, it is quite possible to purchase servers for EDMS and deploy EDMS at their facilities, but only in the case of a proven economic need.</i>  <i>Of particular importance in the company is given the reliability of data storage.</i> <br><br>  The service provides a virtual infrastructure for rent without the need to deploy its capacity.  The client owns the licenses and the decision on the EDS, as well as Root-access to the infrastructure, which allows to transfer the EDS to its facilities at any time.  Regarding the reliability of data storage, we also found out from the experience of offering the Docsvision in the Cloud service that it‚Äôs up to the client‚Äôs choice whether to place the EDS in a rented virtual infrastructure or not to place it, first of all, due to its reliability, security of data placement and reputation virtual provider on the market as a reliable supplier, and already the next customer is interested in the cost-effectiveness of the solution and other factors. <br><br>  That is why we paid special attention to the reliability and security of the EDMS service according to the PaaS model.  We carefully chose a virtual provider and data center where our solutions will be placed.  In the process of working with one of the virtual providers, we were even forced to refuse to work with him, because he did not fully respond to our requirements for the quality and reliability of the services provided.  Starting from March 2016, we deploy all services, including Docsvision HYBRID, only in the infrastructure of the best virtual provider in Russia in terms of quality, reliability and security parameters and in data processing centers in Russia, of an international level not lower than Tier III. <br><br>  5. <i>For the company in the coming days after the request, a personal demo access to the SED is required to enable the organization of internal testing and presentations for the company's management.</i> <br><br>  Personal demo access to the service ‚ÄúDocsvision HYBRID‚Äù with all the technical characteristics as in the proposed order, guarantees familiarity with the SED and allows you to organize internal testing before purchase. <br><br><h1>  How are customers perceived? </h1><br>  Positively.  We see interest in the service.  Indeed, one of the key advantages of the proposal is cost reduction while maintaining a high level of reliability and availability of EDS, and in the case of the PaaS model, this task is uniquely solved by a number of possibilities. <br><br>  Comparing the ‚ÄúDocsvision HYBRID‚Äù service (PaaS-SED) with the local implementation of the SED (On-Premise), we built the following value curve for the client previously mentioned in this post. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd5/eab/f5f/cd5eabf5f7e349638bcf75fd239f835d.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, the service already has a new version of Docsvision Light Client, which allows you to conveniently work through any devices and in any browser. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b0/9d5/241/7b09d52415774fc7a631938a1df3ec59.png"><br><br>  We will be glad to discuss in the comments about the prospects of such a model. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304776/">https://habr.com/ru/post/304776/</a></p>
