  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Venture Dating Service</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last Thursday, Microsoft announced the launch of its <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/BizSpark/">BizSpark</a> startup assistance program in Russia.  The large-scale global program includes assistance to young entrepreneurs with the <a href="http://www.microsoftstartupzone.com/Software/Pages/Products_at_a_glance.aspx">necessary software</a> , educational courses, consulting and marketing support from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/BizSpark/FindNetworkPartner.aspx">numerous partners</a> , as well as direct venture capital investments from the Commonwealth of Business Angels of Russia (ABRA) foundations, ABRT Venture Fund and several others. <br><br>  To become a member of the program, you must be the owner of a private company engaged in software development.  The company must be young - less than 3 years on the market, and have an annual income of no more than $ 500 thousand. In addition, you will need the recommendation of one of the member companies of the partner network (for example, investors or distributors like Softline).  Help from the "older brothers" startupschik will have to pay shares in their company.  The copyright for his product will remain with him. <br><br>  According to the head of Microsoft‚Äôs Russian office, Birger Sten, his company does not consider BizSpark as a direct source of profit.  Like many others, this program is aimed at creating a healthy living ‚Äúecosystem‚Äù of a high-tech economy in the country.  By the way, it is not connected with the crisis in any way - the date of its global launch in early November was timed to the announcement of technological innovations on the PDC. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The scale of the program gave occasion to Deputy Communications Minister Alexei Soldatov to rejoice in the number of ‚Äúinformation workers who hope to survive and make plans for the future,‚Äù despite the crisis.  And the reason for the head of the Duma technological development committee, Vadim Ponomarev, is to remind that the technology parks development program has been in place for a whole year now, Strategy 2020 still represents a set of unrelated declarations without any specific measures, and the Ministry of Finance wraps up all the proposals on tax breaks for an innovative economy.

      Felix Muchnik, the CEO of Softkey, noted that next year the software development market in Russia could double down to the 2005 state.  Methods of reducing costs for many domestic companies, when IT costs are cut, he called ‚Äúinsane‚Äù.  But they can not be ignored - they can seriously slow down any innovation in the industry. <br><br>  But the ‚Äúlength‚Äù of each project at BizSpark at Microsoft and among partners is estimated at 5-10 years, so some positive changes during this time can occur.  By 2020, according to the same Birger Wall, BizSpark participants want to see an increase in the share of software development in the country's GDP from the current 0.2% to a strong 1.5%, with 2/3 of this share being produced by the regions. <br><br>  Dmitry Khalin, head of the department of strategic technologies at Microsoft Russia, expects that up to 200 startups will participate in the program by the end of next summer.  The investment director of the Russian Venture Company, Yan Ryazantsev, today sees "dozens of companies that could be initiated with the help of BizSpark."  He already has 5 startups in IT that are involved, for example, in image processing and creating three-dimensional models online. <br><br>  SBAR Chairman Alexander Kashirin believes that from the point of view of investment, Internet projects, the development of specialized software and communication gadgets would look promising.  Khalin sees a bright future for web services built on the Maykrosoftovskaya model "Soft + Services" and applications on a mobile platform. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/45261/">https://habr.com/ru/post/45261/</a></p>
