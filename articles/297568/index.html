Yandex launched its Minusinsk (an algorithm that finds sites that buy links for promotion, and puts them lower in the search results), updated AGS (one of the filters used by Yandex).  As a result, websites buying and selling links fell by 12-20 positions in search results for all requests.  SEO companies had to revise the methods of work, in particular - to abandon the bid for "perpetual links".

      In the long run, resources will survive, whose optimization is not aimed at increasing traffic, but at attracting customers ‚Äî converting visitors into buyers.  It will be difficult for colleagues who develop the site, adding only buttons, forms and texts.  This is a necessary part of the work, but absolutely useless if there is no concrete result expressed in calls, orders and purchases. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/b07/f41/96d/b07f4196df33a97a50558d8031f0dece.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Today's SEO-specialists - it doesn't matter if they work in-house or in an agency - should be able to assemble the semantic core in two minutes, distribute the requests by pages in one hour, do text analysis not only by words, but also by phrases in 4 hours, optimize sites under the tips.  At the same time, the specialist must have a strategic approach and initially designate points of growth for the client‚Äôs business. <br><br>  Today, taking into work sites, we are faced with a large number of errors, regardless of who was engaged in optimization - an agency, a freelancer or a staff specialist.  Some shortcomings can be corrected by examining user preferences, most - with the help of technology.  We, Kokoc.com, often talk about our own technical developments, but have never said what these tools are and how they work.  Circumstances force us to do it now. <br><br>  <b>Mistakes in collecting semantics</b> <br><br>  Many optimizers compile the semantic core manually, missing part of the queries or choosing ineffective ones.  In this case, the site will not advance in the search results by more than 30-40%.  Naturally, customers are not satisfied with this result. <br><br>  To promote the site to the top, you must use programs that do it competently and quickly.  For several years, we have developed our own tool, which contains more than 90 million queries on various topics.  As a result, the collection of semantics takes about two minutes (plus checking the quality of requests for compliance with the pages of the site). <br><br>  A simple example speaks in favor of automating this process: manual filtering of 50,000 queries takes on average two to three days, and thanks to the use of technology, our optimizers spend one business day on the same volume.  Most SEO companies use third-party services to collect semantics - for example, SEMrush or Key Collector.  Many large and medium-sized players are creating their own tools, but judging by the results, so far these are only developments. <br><br>  <b>Structure errors</b> <br><br>  Many potential customers who come to us to work, there are problems with the structure of the site - not enough filters, tags and subcategories.  This means that users quickly leave the resource, because they do not want to spend time searching for the right product. <br><br>  For example, an online store sells 100 refrigerators - and they are all collected in the same category "Refrigerators" without additional filters.  This is inconvenient for users.  You must create a relevant page for each request.  So, for the phrase ‚Äúrefrigerator side by side 40 cm‚Äù it is better to make a section with all models that fit this criterion, and not to lead to a page with one refrigerator. <br><br>  Thus, when creating the structure of the site, it is necessary to take into account the changed attitude to the search.  Users have become more demanding, they do not want to view several different pages of the site, but expect to receive an offer immediately. <br><br>  In this case, the main and only optimizer tool is experience.  The richer it is, the faster and better the site structure will be reworked. <br><br>  <b>Errors in the distribution of requests by pages</b> <br><br>  Manual processing of requests takes a lot of time.  For example, to distribute 700 requests to the pages of the site, you have to spend a day.  Provided that deadlines are always tight, and the client demands results, optimizers are in a hurry, the quality of work suffers.  As a result, requests are distributed somehow, and this means that for many of them the site will never come out in the top search results. <br><br>  To save time without losing quality, we created a ‚ÄúClusterizer‚Äù, which does this automatically.  If you go back to the example of 700 requests, the service takes one hour to distribute them. <br><br>  Most SEO companies use the same tools for clustering queries as they collect semantics.  True, among them there are those who were developing their own services at the initial stages of work, but it turned out to be difficult to grow them to full-fledged tools due to the difficulty of scaling with an increase in the number of clients and projects.  At the moment, alternative tools to the "Cluster" are not known to us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/089/a42/d26/089a42d26d9c41bf85940a95957d8468.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Errors in text optimization</b> <br><br>  Many optimizers are confident that the ‚Äúnausea‚Äù of the text should not exceed 3-5%, consider each word separately and do not know what to do if there are phrases in the text.  For example, the word "refrigerator" accounts for 3% of the entire text.  And how to count the phrase "buy a refrigerator"?  Most optimizers cannot clearly answer this question.  The fact is that they use publicly available tools that do not allow to count phrases.  With this work, the site will achieve at best average results. <br><br>  We solve the problem with our own development - a text analyzer that automatically matches the words and phrases relevant to the query and indicates phrases that do not apply to it.  The program takes into account morphology, nouns, verbs, synonyms, parts of speech, the number of points and commas.  Thus, the quality of texts from the point of view of search engines is significantly improved, which means that the sites above are ranked in the issue.  Well, the speed.  Manually, this process takes days and weeks, and the text analyzer does the job in an average of four hours. <br><br>  All major market players have similar tools.  Medium and small agencies carry out textual analysis "by eye", based on their own feelings, or use primitive services, such as text.ru. <br><br>  <b>Work with tips</b> <br><br>  Many SEO experts are accustomed to fighting for high-frequency queries that brought a large amount of traffic to the client, but they were replaced by hints.  For example, when a user starts typing the phrase ‚Äúbuy a sofa‚Äù in the search box ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù, without adding the last word to the end, he sees in the first place the hint ‚Äúbuy a sofa in Moscow‚Äù.  This happens because the search engine analyzes the tips for different types of requests and updates the list quarterly to answer users' questions as accurately as possible. <br><br>  Today, less and less people are typing a request entirely - the majority switches to the options offered by the search engine.  And if the resource does not use the capabilities of this tool, it loses the lion‚Äôs share of traffic.  For example, an online store may be in the top for high-frequency queries, but traffic will be small and will not lead to an increase in sales.  The reason, as mentioned above, is that many users choose prompts in which this online store does not exist. <br><br>  The site must be optimized for search prompts: collect keywords for each request, clustering and analyze existing (or new) pages for prompts.  Let's take a simple example: for analyzing 1 million requests manually, several weeks are needed, and at the same time there is a risk that after the analysis is completed, the search engine will already update the prompts.  In order not to waste time on this process, we developed a tool that analyzes the same volume of requests in two minutes. <br><br>  Most companies use SEMrush and Key Collector, but analyzing with their help takes more than a day, and clustering does not work correctly.  We do not know about the qualitative analogues of these tools. <br><br>  Summing up the changes that took place in 2015, I would like to say that with the current search engine ranking algorithms, SEO agencies need to develop their own technologies for high-quality website promotion.  Optimizers who are not ready for this will have a hard time. <br><br>  Source: The <a href="http://secretmag.ru/article/2015/12/25/sergej-viryasov/">Secret of the Firm</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297568/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297568/</a></p>
