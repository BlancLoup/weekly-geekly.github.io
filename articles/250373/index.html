      In the autumn Yulich <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/lesnikova/" class="user_link">lesnikova</a> , with whom we had been well acquainted with her educational activities at Digital October for a long time, decided to cut a children's educational project.  Well, she called us, Mosigru, because we have games.  Of course, I became wildly interested, and I took a little part in the preparation. <br><br>  The idea she already told ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/prodlenka/blog/248307/">here</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/prodlenka/blog/247753/">here</a> ).  The point is this: a good educational project, where a teaser lesson with cool guys who talk about their profession is first done.  Then - links to the nearest circles, books, didactic materials, etc., to study at home yourself, as the child inserts to become someone from the teaser.  So that he not only dreamed, but also took a soldering iron in his hands, for example. <br><br>  First, Yulich called Durov through acquaintances.  Someone said that he simply did not respond to such requests, someone asked clarifying questions.  But in the end it was not.  Although just showing his face is already +3 to the skill of developing a child.  Then all the others were added (Kodabra, Yandex, Parallels). <br><br>  <b>As a result, the scheme emerged as follows:</b> <br><ul><li>  Bobuk makes a scary face and tells how to save the world.  Children rushing, they dragged. </li><li>  Parallels in the face of the girl talk about the fact that it is not necessary to be a kid to program. </li><li>  And Kodabra finishes with the first short lesson in children's programming language, where after 5 lines of code you can already see a beautiful picture. </li><li>  And I make sure that children do not fall asleep, and play with them. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ea/c85/990/0eac859902cd463bbcba62317db59897.jpeg"><br>  <sup>IDE: game state and very high-level code editor</sup> <br><br>  On technical runs - wild delight.  The project got the team Kira Taubert.  The feeling is that a group of thoughtful shadowrunners arrived, assessed all the risks and closed them.  Hall they climbed in millimeters.  I do not know their specifics, but it was felt that they are extremely attentive to details and specific: and this, regardless of the sphere, always pleases and gives rise to confidence. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/94a/e79/963/94ae799631d34eb3858fb6b6b9f333e1.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e1f/355/682/e1f3556822ea43aebece8a82e62ddb6e.jpeg"><br><br>  Of the features - it was very difficult to get rid of the board game on the stage for 6 players.  Kira threw one guproch on the beam from above, and we spent half an hour putting the playing field on the server cover.  In the end, when it was necessary for me to go out, one comrade put the table on the stage under the camera, and I covered it with a field cover behind the curtains.  Happened. <br><br><h4>  The lesson itself </h4><br>  There were about 600 registrations in the hall (in fact 350 people came from them).  I arrived in 40 minutes, and there were already people on the spot.  Without much hesitation, we began to play with the children in the penguin-pirates on the desire - most often on something like "the loser makes somersaults", "the loser is on his hands" and so on.  Because well, what for these logical games for children who come to learn how to code?  They have every chance to beat me.  And all instagram: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/239/d20/8eb/239d208eb8654b51be8486fd3be43bf1.jpeg"><br>  <sup>In the background, children collect robots from Lego</sup> <br><br>  Then they played for erudition in "Answer in 5 seconds."  It was important, the children had to see that it was easy to play it - the fact is that I prepared special questions to test knowledge after the lectures of my colleagues.  Checking knowledge in the game is very cool.  The child will have another day to think about how it was possible to answer better, and eventually dig up everything on the subject. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2f9/1df/d0b/2f91dfd0be5a49f0855a5e9b3102fb3d.jpeg"><br><br>  Nearby, Mann, Ferber, and Ivanov with their book and children's shop decomposed.  I later saw their sales and regretted that we did not bring our shop: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/982/b87/956/982b87956f3f4a3b9ad1b7546c663d8e.jpeg"><br><br>  Then it began.  The hall was almost full, when suddenly a whole group of girls entered it.  They all so impressed with their appearance that it was impossible not to look back.  This is the future IS of our country, profile courses, get acquainted: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d34/ebb/5b9/d34ebb5b91bf4900a04985eded9ba2d1.jpeg"><br><br>  Here Bobuk from Yandex shows an ordinary case from the life of a programmer - you need to solve the problems of mankind: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ea/93c/982/1ea93c98281848b7affd144b8ccbb1e8.jpeg"><br><br>  Here is his report, it is cool and very motivating at any age: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/tf-v7PAx778%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhTAGuU7rGfh3Cdjrm7QiEMLWGDDA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <sup>Yulich was only a little worried at the beginning.</sup> <br><br>  Then we played "Taxi" on the stage - this is a game especially for seven-year programmers, and I <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/246795/">told</a> about it.  We finally thought and decided to take and give all the sources in open access so that you can safely make the same house.  And <a href="http://www.mosigra.ru/blog/id2%25D0%25A1100000378/">they did</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/683/3b1/e2e/6833b1e2e958402a8375f0271044add3.jpeg"><br><br>  Then Anna Melekhova (a developer girl writing a virtual machine) from Parallels spoke: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/726/c2d/26f/726c2d26f5f844698af65c5aac13ede9.jpeg"><br><br>  Here I must say that there were special honeypot children of different ages in the hall, who evaluated the clarity and interestingness of each speaker.  It was here that they didn‚Äôt move in at all, what‚Äôs the problem: before the lecture started, it turns out, none of them even thought that a programmer is only a male profession.  Therefore - this is an example of performance only for parents. <br><br>  At this point, the children became furious and began to troll with questions: ‚ÄúWhat's better: Python or C ++?‚Äù, ‚ÄúCan you write in the outdated PHP language?‚Äù.  Nobody asked the question about the guinea pig, but I waited, I waited very much. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0c4/a40/d4e/0c4a40d4e0c3458388f115f3604358f6.jpeg"><br><br>  Then we played again.  There is a question on the screen, the child has 5 seconds to answer.  Just like in the desktop, only questions are not out of the box, but specially selected. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Here they are, you can try to play with the child right now.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  - Name any three websites (oh, I was waiting a lot, but the answer was simple - Google, Yandex, Yahu!) <br>  - Name three places for a programmer (as long as everything is simple) <br>  - What are the three steps that need to be done to cook borscht (the first difficult question: you need to break the procedure into steps). <br>  - Name three steps to put a giraffe in the fridge (here the girl knew everything and even called four - open the fridge, pull out an elephant, put a giraffe, close the fridge). <br>  - Name three any robots (a difficult question, but the children managed). <br>  - Name three computer games (easy! But no, the guy was confused). <br>  - Name three logical games (also easy) <br>  - Prime numbers are those natural ones greater than one, which are divisible only by themselves and 1. Name three prime numbers (this question was the most difficult). <br>  - And now three more prime numbers! <br>  - Name three steps to raise an elephant in a balloon (we continue to algorithmize the processes, for now, just) <br>  - Name three steps to sew a button on a sausage (raise the degree of difficulty - we learn abstraction. Easily coped, thinking in children is more flexible than in adults). <br>  - Name three any programmers (Notch, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs). <br>  - Name three phone models (easy) <br>  - Name three computer companies (easy) <br>  - Name three parts of the computer (easy) <br>  - What are the three things that a home robot can do (a dream has lit up in the eyes) <br>  - Name three things that the robot should not do (I was waiting for ‚Äúdrink, smoke and swear‚Äù, but everything was easier). <br>  - Name three items that can be printed on a 3D printer (hard question) <br>  Well and further without comments: <br>  - Name three places where you can meet a programmer. <br>  - What are three things you can repair a robot? <br>  - Name three games you can play against the computer <br>  - What are three things a programmer can carry? <br>  - Name three favorite school subjects of programmers <br>  - Name three languages ‚Äã‚Äãa programmer can know. </div></div><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/60d/aa5/cb7/60daa5cb72324ef180eefa13794ce018.jpeg"><br>  <sup>Run, we check how younger children will react to the game "Taxi" on the screen.</sup>  <sup>Little Vera cannot orient herself on a vertical plane, so she tries to stand with her back (as the car moves) and walk, and then look, left or right.</sup> <br><br>  And then Kodabra with her practical code.
