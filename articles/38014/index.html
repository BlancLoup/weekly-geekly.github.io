  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why do corporations hate perl?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The organizers of the <a href="http://www.yapceurope2008.org/">YAPC :: Europe</a> conference announced that the main theme next year will be the use of Perl at the corporate level.  Or rather, the problem of what to do with the enormous volumes of poor-quality code that have accumulated over many years. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/2607">Dave Cross</a> , a technology developer and journalist, has been creating Perl corporate systems all his life, attending the aforementioned conference, where he spoke with company representatives.  He writes on O'Reilly ONLamp's blog that he himself could have announced next year with a report on the topic <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2008/08/why_corporates_hate_perl.html">‚ÄúWhy Corporations Hate Perl‚Äù</a> .  This is really unfair, says Cross. <br><br>  Dave Cross is not worried about his own future as a programmer, because until his retirement he can be provided with work, supporting many of the systems he has already created.  However, the fact is that many large companies are now abandoning Perl and are going to rewrite everything in Java + PHP.

      At present, the developers of the web systems themselves are clearly beginning to treat Perl as one technologically obsolete artifact and, on the whole, speak disdainfully about it.  This mood is transmitted to customers who do not understand the technology, but now they immediately start worrying when they barely hear the word ‚Äúperl‚Äù.  They do not need "outdated" solutions, they want beautiful systems on new technologies. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Dave Cross acknowledges that in ten years companies have accumulated a lot of poorly written Perl code.  But its poor quality is not due to the technological imperfections of Perl itself, but by completely different reasons.  In fact, developers worked in an environment where quality was not a top priority.  Many projects were the first steps of companies in the field of web development.  Naturally, the quality of the projects was not up to par.  Created by individual units, these systems often could not even exchange information with each other.  Not surprisingly, maintaining this code is now a difficult task. <br><br>  On the other hand, there are many examples when a modern system is created in Perl, and it performs well: it is easy to maintain and refine.  Here Perl is not inferior to any newfangled language. <br><br>  Certainly, companies have accumulated a lot of code that needs to be rewritten over the next few years.  However, the transition to new languages ‚Äã‚Äãis too radical a measure.  Executives blame Perl for the problems that are actually explained by management mistakes and the wrong approach to development. <br><br>  Ten or twelve years ago, almost all of us created Perl applications and we all made mistakes.  Now we have to correct these errors.  But over the years we have become more experienced and now we can rewrite the system, taking into account all that we have learned over the years, writes Dave Cross. <br><br>  The hardest part is fixing Perl's reputation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/38014/">https://habr.com/ru/post/38014/</a></p>
