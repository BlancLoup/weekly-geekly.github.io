Particulars: 1) When reducing equivalent types to one (for example, array indices to whole), types that can be reduced should be clearly identified;  2) In classes that are inheritable, all internal calls are protected from change;  3) Where flexibility (as opposed to simplicity) should be avoided, the parameters preset in the code should be avoided; it is better to use optional arguments;  4) If the possibility of processing both positional and iterative arguments is not necessary, you should not process different signatures in the constructor, it is better to determine separate methods for these needs;  5) It is better to use keyword arguments than to change signatures by adding new positional arguments;  6) To ensure that the signature of the constructor of the inherited class does not conflict with the signature of the constructor of the inheritable class, the last can be determined indirectly - in one of the methods.
