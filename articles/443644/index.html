  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We roll eggs together with Unity</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  In this small note I want to share the results of the sufferings of this night.  This is not an informational article that puts the wisdom of generations in mind.  Just a set of notes. </p><br><p>  For starters, the result was <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D8BBZnmOf0cI">this video</a></strong> .  From the point of view of the viewer, here is a video about how to make a mini-game on Unity from scratch.  If absolutely accurate, she does not respond to any of the definitions from the Schreiber kit, but nobody cares.  Seriously, if you consider yourself stupid and incapable of anything (I am such), then repeat as in a vidos and everything works. </p><br><p>  But under the cut there will be a <strong>little about the internal kitchen and pain</strong> .  This is only for those who themselves write something and want to discuss. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1 id="oblast-opredeleniya">  Domain </h1><br><p>  <strong>What is the goal</strong> : I need to deal with video production and development at the same time, which is difficult without an understanding of the work of the video maker and the C # developer.  As you know, the best way to understand something is to try it yourself, and even better to make a video course on this. </p><br><p>  <strong>What is not the goal</strong> : 1) Become a famous blogger, get involved in marketing, traffic surges, etc.  This is the theme of a separate adventure for sometime later.  2) To produce a really high-quality video - I am not yet capable of this, at least within a reasonable time (two days). </p><br><p>  What interesting conclusions were made from this session? </p><br><h1 id="mikrofon-i-premiere">  Microphone and Premiere </h1><br><p>  Have you noticed that Lesha Shevtsov in the vidos headphones stuck in Blue Yeti?  It seems, now I guess why.  It turns out that the creators of Adobe Premiere 2019 in their wisdom do not allow to output sound to two different sound cards, if it is ASIO.  Previously, I somehow did not think about it, but now I travel around Siberia, and of course I didn‚Äôt take the huge coffin of an external USB zvukovuhi with me - but in vain! </p><br><p>  That is, naturally, you switch to ASIO, and that setting block disappears from you, which is Output, only the ASIO channel mapping remains.  And this means that if you write the sound directly from BlueYeti using its built-in ASIO, then the surprise is that you can listen to what you recorded (just like listening to the music from the browser with tutorials) only through the microphone!  Listen to music through the microphone, Karl! </p><br><p>  In general, there is such a cool ASIO router, O Deus ASIO Link Pro.  The author of this program recently died, by the way, and the source in Open Source is not passed.  Yes, that's just the license remained somewhere on the hard drive in St. Petersburg, and the outdated version of the trackers is buggy on Windows 10. </p><br><p>  Fortunately, the microphone has an audio output for a mini-jack, where you can plug in headphones.  The mini-bad news is that this output always monitors the microphone itself, so you can‚Äôt quietly listen to anything - with minimal delay you will hear your clicks on the keyboard, panting like a neighbor Vasya loves Manyu behind the wall, and the noise of computer fans will acquire a new deep color.  Well, you can constantly press the mute button on the microphone, of course.  I would also record some kind of video about this hell, but I don‚Äôt quite understand how to do it, because I‚Äôll have to write with the same microphone for the same Premier :) </p><br><h1 id="asio">  ASIO </h1><br><p>  By the way, you ask, why ASIO?  And because BlueYeti gives a completely different sound through MME and ASIO.  I conducted the test - the same loud sound was lost from the phone and recorded using both methods.  The MME option is incredibly worse.  Straight to complete non-recoverability in case the microphone clips. </p><br><p>  Due to convenience issues with ASIO, I write the finishing sound to them, and the draft sound to MME. </p><br><p>  Have you heard how bad the sound is in this video?  This is because due to frequent reloads (which will be discussed further), I lost the clean ASIO recording, and had to be done on the MME draft.  It was just that there was no strength for the second double.  Anyway, this is a sandpaper, to write with doubles?  :-) </p><br><h1 id="adobe-premiere-2019-kak-takovaya">  Adobe Premiere 2019 per se </h1><br><p>  Previously, I pasted a little video in older versions and therefore it is possible to compare.  In the fresh version a lot of bugs.  Perhaps this is partly due to Node.js, on which the new interface is written - Adobe has not yet figured out how to prepare this beast.  At the start, Premiere creates several copies of the JS engine, which hangs in the form of separate processes next to it, and by killing these processes you can pull out the interface pieces from the root.  Redrawing is slow, with a load on the computer - it may not redraw at all (you need to resize the window with the mouse so that the redraw starts).  In the interface, there are bumpy transitions between states, out of which you can only reload the application - the analogue is ‚Äústuck in textures‚Äù.  If you describe the sensations in one phrase, it will be "slows down and buggy." </p><br><p>  Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt go back to the old versions, because it was only in the latest version that I fixed a bug with the Blackmagic hooks. </p><br><p>  And, a couple of words about the UI / UX interface itself.  We in programming are used to using perfectly licked things like IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse, and attempts to use something professional for other professions are usually very painful.  I can‚Äôt even convey the pain I experienced from what Premiere is trying to do to repeat the Eclipse Perspectives, it is physically painful to use it.  Not to mention the fact that the interface directly screams to you that it is desirable to have 2 monitors, and that monitor where the time line is, preferably in 4k UHD.  And I, for example, have a vision - minus 5 on both eyes, and this 4k nafig didn‚Äôt get into how to be.  Well, this is probably not the premiere is so bad, and the world of software development is so good that we have the tools with the perfect UX.  Developers make software not at the behest of analysts, but for themselves, and therefore they understand what they are doing. </p><br><h1 id="perezagruzki-kompyutera">  Computer restart </h1><br><p>  This is purely my personal problem, judging by the forums, only a few units of sick people have similar behavior. </p><br><p>  Under load, the computer hangs in the blue screen. </p><br><p>  This is not my computer, but a temporary computer that exists while I am visiting in Novosibirsk.  Therefore, it is not possible to change it / reasonable. </p><br><p>  I read the contents of crash dumps, there is nothing intelligible, which means most likely a hardware error, from which the Windows can escape only with a complete stop without saving the state.  Starting from a certain moment, the crashpumps were no longer written, however, it seems that here you have to blame the Windows Insider Preview  But there are blue screens on a stable version of Windows too. </p><br><p>  At the previous iteration of the proceedings, I changed the thermal paste on the video card and launched it under MSI Afterburner with daunkloc in all respects.  What led to a decrease in the number of freezes.  I even managed to play under the record in something easy like Overwatch, for a short time. </p><br><p>  It also led to an increase in stream fallouts, because it turned out that my Wirecast is not very friendly with Afterburner.  True, he calls it another way - "Afterburner can lead to system instability, if this happens, delete it." </p><br><p>  A lot of things happened while recording this fakap movie. </p><br><p>  Firstly, due to frequent reloads, I lost the clean version of the recording, as a result I had to do everything over the draft with a disgusting sound recorded through MME instead of ASIO. </p><br><p>  First, it turned out that somewhere a minute in a normally creatively meaningful video takes an hour of installation.  That is, the entire movie for an hour twenty can easily take a whole month.  This is no good.  Therefore, to speed up the process, I began by replacing the brain with more instant effects from tutorials on YouTube, blinded together and was pleasantly surprised by the effect.  Especially saves time not using greens. </p><br><p>  But it turned out that the video is going to be rendered 4 hours.  I, in principle, do not mind.  But the computer - sorry.  At a distance of 4 hours, it hangs in a blue screen in 100% of cases.  But the results of the render still may not like it! </p><br><p>  Therefore, I had to, with a creaking heart, throw all this rubbish into a landfill, and from the operation ‚Äúbrainless effects‚Äù go to the option ‚Äúhellish trash‚Äù.  The most complex effect now is transiting the images, and this is calculated on the CPU almost faster than on the GPU.  Rendering time was reduced to an hour. </p><br><p>  And everything would be fine, but the devil swam there.  Hour the computer under load, too, could not work through once.  I had to climb into the iron.  I threw away all unnecessary extensions (such as USB wires) and moved the video card in PCI-E closer to the processor.  By this, I intended to kill two hares: to give vidyuhi more air (it worked, the temperature dropped by 5 degrees!) And to check if the problem is connected with a buggy PCI-E. </p><br><p>  The first fakap was found out right away: in that PCI-E, in which vidyuha worked normally, the HDMI capture card refuses to work flatly.  Well, it starts up, is identified in the system, but claims that it does not see the video stream.  However, I don‚Äôt need it to record a trash movie, so this is just a test: something is wrong with this PCI-E. </p><br><p>  The second fact is that, despite such sacrifices, the computer still cannot live an hour. </p><br><p> The last measure was to go into the BIOS and put everything in there by hand.  Voltage (low), memory frequencies (manually, fixed, low), multipliers by 34, etc.  All that had the mark "smart", "intelligent" or "boost" went to either disabled or normal mode (this is for several switches that can save power and turbo as well as normal - it‚Äôs clear that both systems can fail ... and normal also can).  Turned off all unnecessary peripherals, left only USB-3, in which the Anker hub with external power now sticks out (suddenly the mother is unable to provide power to the USB?).  I even turned off VT-x, so 64-bit virtual machines, that is, all virtual machines, no longer work.  Zvukovuhu too turned off, I listened to the vidosiki via bluetooth headphones (disgusting, how do you use them in conjunction with a computer?). </p><br><p>  But on the PCI-E video card I gave all the lines and agreed that all other PCI-Es on the motherboard would be disconnected (two birds with one blow: and turn off possibly broken PCI-E, and maybe speed up the video if she suddenly knows how, I am I do not understand). </p><br><p>  At this iteration, the computer lived for an hour and rendered everything. </p><br><p>  Now here I suffer.  Surely this is not a video card, not built into the mother zvukovuha, namely the combination of sound and video card.  Two areas where driver writing doesn't give a damn.  For example, on another computer I had blue screens from a combination of external usb sound and network card, but that‚Äôs another story. </p><br><p>  It seems to be done, but I'm somehow morally exhausted. </p><br><h1 id="rabochee-reshenie-dlya-zapisi-1080">  1080 Recording Work Solution </h1><br><p>  The most working solution (of the hardware I had) was to capture video and sound on a Macbook.  Compressed capture can be done directly through OBS, and I would not advise tormenting an uncompressed laptop, after all, SSD for writing is a consumable, and you can not change a soldered SSD on a laptop.  The laptop connects to a Windows PC via a Gigabit Ethernet cable, after which all captured files are quickly copied to the Windows ball, right inside the Premiere project.  The only general purpose of this dubious uncomfortable scheme is that the laptop does not restart randomly, as my PC does. </p><br><h1 id="vyvody">  findings </h1><br><p>  Something done, something happened.  I will do further, even if you zaminusuete to the floor.  It would be interesting to hear feedback from other video makers (if any) about their first steps and sound things that need to be done first. </p><br><p>  It is half past five at night.  Or in the morning.  It is necessary to sleep for three hours, then to turn on the boost and to have time for the morning scrum-rally to do yesterday's work, which I had prosanadil with all this nonsense.  Thank you for reading to the end.  I'm not quite sure why you did it, but if so - respect and respect! </p></div>
