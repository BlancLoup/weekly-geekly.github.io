Under the cut you are waiting for the news of the cloud platform, traditionally presented on the key report of the first day of the conference. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9a2/5dc/a2d/9a25dca2dde04b70a2dc7a73360b5abf.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Microsoft Vice President Scott Guthrie said that the emergence of new services and new features of Microsoft Azure throughout the year is due not only to the need to develop the platform, but also the company's desire to make our partners, customers and developers more successful, efficient and focused only on improving their solutions. . <br><br>  That is why the Azure platform today is not only a set of cool tools and a combine of innovations, but it has a face and guarantees every developer access to proven recommendations, expert advice and support.

      ‚ÄúThe success of your decision on the Azure platform is our main goal,‚Äù repeated Scott Guthrie from the stage. <br><br><h2>  Developer Tools </h2><br>  Microsoft provides a complete, seamlessly integrated solution for creating better services using the cloud and the development tools of the Visual Studio family.  Over the past year, the offer has only grown and everyone can choose any available tool to their own taste - Visual Studio IDE in various editions, Visual Studio Team Services, Visual Studio Code, and so on. <br><br>  Today, Microsoft is pleased to announce the <b>full release of the long-awaited <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/">Visual Studio for Mac</a></b> .  This edition of the tool is a transfer of experience with your beloved millions of IDE on a Mac. <br><br>  To create their own solutions in C #, F #,. NET Core, ASP.NET Core, Xamarin, or Unity, developers got a familiar tool designed for OS X operating system features. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/cbe/257/595/cbe25759584347799d04e6ac4bb1bfc9.png"><br><br>  Continuing the theme of development tools, Microsoft is announcing the new <b>Azure Cloud Shell</b> - a command line tool that provides the ability to work with Azure directly from a browser on the portal or from any other workplace.  Each Cloud Shell session provides access to a customized environment, automatically synchronized with the $ Home directory, which is stored in Azure.  This allows access to files containing automation scripts and so on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e86/73e/97c/e8673e97cc904f50b8d794e1c5d8ba7d.gif"><br><br><h2>  Data </h2><br>  Data and the experience that developers provide to the end user every day are key to any application.  To store this data, a variety of products are used to meet the various needs and preferences of IT professionals.  Today, Microsoft announced a <b>new service in Azure, which will allow moving third-party databases and SQL Server to Azure SQL Database with almost zero downtime</b> . <br><br>  Microsoft also announced the availability of <b>Azure Database for MySQL</b> and <b>Azure Database for PostgreSQL</b> .  These new databases in Azure are provided as a service and guarantee high availability, data protection, recovery, and scaling without the need for additional settings and costs, since all this is already built into the offer itself. <br><br>  Microsoft today announced <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/documentdb/documentdb-consistency-levels">Azure Cosmos DB</a></b> - a completely new type of database, provided as a service on the Azure platform.  The service is specially created for globally distributed cloud applications that operate with large volumes of information.  This is the first such database service providing horizontal scaling with guaranteed uptime, throughput, stability and delay of just a millisecond, which makes it better than 99% of other solutions.  Developers get an incredible level of flexibility with a unique, uncirculated database service, with support for the popular NoSQL API, as well as with five well-defined consistency options and auto-indexing of all your data. <br><br><h2>  Containers and microservices </h2><br>  Today, Microsoft provides several types of orchestrators for managing containers in the cloud, including Kubernetes, Docker Swarm and Mesos DC / OS within the Azure Container Service. <br><br>  Additionally, engineers have been working on a whole year on new tools to containerize existing .NET applications and deploy them to Azure. <br><br>  Microsoft also announced the expansion of this scenario with Azure Service Fabric.  Today, Microsoft has updated our popular service, providing Docker Compose native support in preview for deploying multi-container applications on Azure Service Fabric.  In addition, now <b>Windows Server containers are also supported in Azure Service Fabric with version 5.6 and SDK version 2.6</b> . <br><br><h2>  Azure for developers </h2><br>  Microsoft continues to actively develop serverless computing.  We are pleased to present you a preview of the tools for creating and publishing Azure Functions, which you can install as extensions for Visual Studio 2017. Microsoft also announces support for Azure Functions as part of Application Insights. <br><br><h2>  Additionally </h2><br>  Of course, not all announcements fit together in a limited time key report: <br><br><ul><li>  NET Core 2.0 Preview will allow developers to use an extended set of unified .NET Standard 2.0 APIs - including XML, Serialization, Networking, IO and thousands more - written once and run in various .NET execution environments (.NET Framework, .NET Core, Xamarin and Universal Windows Platform). <br><br></li><li>  New features in <a href="http://aka.ms/dotnetcore2preview">ASP.NET Core 2.0 Preview</a> include Razor Pages, a simplified syntax for combining server and HTML code, optimized launch and even higher performance.  ASP.NET Core 2.0 web applications can now use Azure autodiagnosis and monitoring without requiring developers to write any additional code or republish the application. <br><br></li><li>  <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/">Visual Studio 2017 version 15.2</a> contains bug fixes and new features that were not available in previous releases, including the return of Python and Data Science tools (including R, Python, and F #) and TypeScript 2.2 support. <br><br></li><li>  <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/preview/">Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3 Preview</a> also contains bug fixes and additional features, in particular support for .NET Core 2.0 Preview, Live Unit Testing for .NET Core projects, C ++ standards, improvements to Continuous Delivery for ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core in Azure App Services framework and container application tools. <br><br></li><li>  Visual Studio Snapshot Debugger, a new application debugging tool that can provide developers with a deeper understanding of the behavior of an application published in the cloud, for example, when an exception is detected.  Without the need for additional configuration of logs or special exception handling. <br><br></li><li>  <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/snapshot-debugger/">Azure Batch Rendering</a> is an easy way to scale a rendering task using Autodesk 3ds Max and Maya.  Interacting with Autodesk, Azure is the first public cloud to provide such integration between client applications, licensing, orchestration, and infrastructure. <br><br></li><li>  Low-priority Batch for Linux and Windows VMs provides access to residual capacity using Azure Batch.  With discounts of up to 80%, Low-priority Batch increases flexibility and cost control for large loads, allowing you to mix and match low-priority VMs and VMs on demand. </li></ul><br>  The rest of the cloud platform news from the key report of the first day of the Build conference can be found in the <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2017/05/10/announcing-new-innovations-at-microsoft-build-2017/">official publication from Scott Guthrie</a> . <br><br><h2>  follow the news </h2><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/microsoft/blog/328014/">Text translation of the first day of the conference</a> . </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/microsoft/blog/328366/">Text translation of the second day of the conference</a> . </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/microsoft/blog/328460/">Key announcements of the second day of the conference</a> . </li><li>  News in official social networks of Microsoft Developer: <a href="https://vk.com/msdnru">VK</a> , <a href="https://www.facebook.com/msdnru/">Facebook</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/msdevru">Twitter</a> , <a href="https://t.me/msdnru">Telegram</a> . </li><li>  <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/%3Fwt.mc_id%3Dbuild_hp">English language broadcast of 1, 2 and 3 days of the conference + recording after the live broadcast</a> . </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/328378/">https://habr.com/ru/post/328378/</a></p>
