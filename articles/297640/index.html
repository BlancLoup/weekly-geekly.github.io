Careful buy links </h4><br>  The main trend of website promotion in 2016 is a more thoughtful selection of donor sites for purchasing links.  On the one hand, the role of the content of the site has slightly decreased, but the ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù parameters started playing more strongly: trust, spam, Alexa Traffic Rank, Majestic Trust Flow, page load time, domain age, for this you have to use the check services - Checktrust, Ahrefs, Majesticseo .  Now it is not necessary to buy links in tons, but it is necessary to check donors more often, remove spoiled sites, replace them with new ones. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For Google, the smooth growth of the number of links is still important, therefore, if the promotion is in both search engines, it is also necessary to gradually increase the reference mass, and not just maintain a certain amount.  Separately, it is necessary to say about the services of buying eternal article links - in 2016, you need to use only those services that have the function of quick and guaranteed removal of links.  The fact is that in the second half of 2015, Yandex began to drive many sites under the AGS filter that host perpetual links.  If the webmaster for a long time can not remove the filter (more than six months), then such a link will not be in the plus of your site.  Especially if the text itself is non-thematic (Although it is not at all clear why pay a lot of money for a perpetual non-thematic review). <br><br><h4>  2. Classical promotion with texts - at a new level. </h4><br>  Of course, no one needs the huge footcloths of the text of 6000-10000 characters generated by schoolchildren.  Here it is something else: for about more than a year, most SEO companies are gradually moving away from positions.  This is quite logical, since Yandex becomes less predictable for outputting requests to the Top, and for Google you need a large number of high-quality (expensive) links.  Customers, in turn, want a clear payment plan with a predictable result.  For some, the optimal scheme of work is a complex promotion, for some - only payment for traffic.  Anyway, in 2016-2017, the search traffic to the site will be the main factor for the success of the promotion.  And to attract a large amount of traffic can only optimize the site for a large number of thematic low-frequency and mid-frequency queries.  To do this, successful optimizers regularly place on the sites of thematic articles, market news, rewriting and translations, interviews, descriptions of goods and services, instructions, and so on.  A large number of high-quality and well-structured text material will create a mass of LF and MF requests, they will come out in the TOP and search traffic will go to the site.

    <h4>  3. Contextual advertising is useful for SEO </h4><br>  A sustainable business is one that can diversify risks.  Take, for example, a site with 70-80% of the traffic coming from a search.  At the same time, the share of Yandex is, for example, 80% of the total search traffic.  In fact, the entire client's business rests on the sole organic distribution of Yandex with its unpredictable updates.  Imagine what will happen to the business if the site falls under the filter and the traffic from Yandex disappears?  It will first take a month to understand the situation, then another month to change tactics.  That is why we recommend everyone not only to optimize the site for both search engines, but also to keep contextual advertising.  The share of the advertising budget in Yandex.Direct and Advords will reduce the risks in the event of unpleasant surprises from the organic issue, and besides, visitors with paid advertising create additional behavioral factors that are taken into account by Yandex.  Naturally, this is much better than using the PF cheat for this purpose.  If you look at the statistics, then we consider a normal percentage of conversions from contextual advertising in general traffic around 20-40%.  There are topics where this share can be even greater. <br><br><h4>  4. Marketers will become richer </h4><br>  Of course, the site should be optimized for key requests, tags and texts should be spelled out, quality links should be purchased.  Why do visitors leave the site?  Why throw baskets in online stores?  How to understand for what reasons the client "falls off"?  For those businessmen who have recognized these problems, 2016 will be the year of work on the site‚Äôs marketing mistakes.  For the rest - a year of financial losses and complaints about their SEO-specialists.  A very common situation: the site is in the top for many phrases, there is traffic, paid advertising works, but sales are few.  So something is wrong with the site.  Sometimes this can be seen with the naked eye, but usually requires a great deal of analytical experience to notice shortcomings in the selling qualities of the site.  Often enough to conduct a usability audit to understand what can be improved on the site.  We also recommend watching the rate of direct hits - this parameter indirectly shows how popular the site is.  The fact that the site was found in the search and switched to it still does not mean anything.  But if people type a site in the address bar of the browser with a certain constancy - it means that the site is interesting for them and they, most likely, tell and throw it off to their friends and acquaintances. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Often, search engine optimization develops contrary to forecasts.  She can not stay in one place, and this is her peculiarity.  My opinion is this: the year 2016 will be very interesting for internet marketers.  Of course, for the implementation of all the above strategies, significant investments will be needed - both forces and material resources.  It is also necessary to take into account the duration of the process of such implementation. <br>  However, it should be understood that the era of quick decisions, as well as the almost ‚Äúmagical‚Äù SEO, is irrevocably a thing of the past.  Continuous improvement of search engines, their increasing demands for ‚Äúcleanliness‚Äù and the obligatory organicity of the issue factor - all this is aimed at creating maximum convenience for Internet users, that is, for all of us.  Those who follow the recommendations of the search engines - in relation to the creation and promotion of websites - will succeed. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297640/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297640/</a></p>
