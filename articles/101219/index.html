And became a fan of her work.  She is the author of the famous ‚Äújam research‚Äù <i>(I will write about him below - the translator)</i> . <br><br>  <b>Paradox of choice</b> <br>  In his book, <a href="http://www.books.ru/shop/books/323432%3Fpartner%3D538879">The Paradox of Choice.</a>  <a href="http://www.books.ru/shop/books/323432%3Fpartner%3D538879">Why more is less. ‚Äù</a> Barry Schwartz spoke about how much we want to have a lot of options.  The paradox is that when we have too many choices, we usually do not choose at all.  In my book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321603605">, Neuro Web Design: What Causes Us to Click,</a> I devoted an entire chapter to our need to have a choice and, as a result, an inability to choose.

      <b>Congenital desire to control</b> <br>  The desire to control the environment lives within us, we were born with it.  It makes sense, because  controlling the environment, we are likely to increase our chances of survival.  After reading the Tire's reasoning about the choice, I thought about the management and the relationship between the choices and the choices.  The desire to control is associated with the desire to have a choice. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>The need to manage begins early in life</b> <br>  Studying babies, the researchers attached the hands of the children to the thread.  Children could move their hands, pulling the thread that made play music.  And then the researchers disconnected the thread from the music control.  They began to play the melody at about the same interval, but the children could no longer control it.  And as a result, they became sad and angry, despite the fact that the music continued to play with the same frequency.  The children wanted to control the moment when the music began to play. <br><br>  <b>We think that choice is management.</b> <br>  Above the rats conducted an experiment.  They were shown a direct path to food and a path with branches.  Rats preferred the path with branches, where there was a need to choose.  Monkeys and pigeons were taught to press buttons to get food.  And they preferred to have more than one button, although it did not give them more food. <br><br>  Even if this is not always true, we equate the ability to choose and the ability to manage.  We must feel that our actions influence something.  Sometimes having a lot of choice makes it difficult to get what we want, but we still want to have a choice, thus feeling that we are managing our decision. <br><br><h4>  And now experiment with jam </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c7e/283/35a/c7e28335afce7490df5d8c4399532171.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In 2000, an experiment was conducted on store customers.  They were offered to choose and buy jam from a small or large assortment (6 or 24 types of jam, respectively).  In the first case, 40% of people stopped and tasted jam from several cans, and in the second case they were already 60%. <br><br>  But!  In the first case, of all the people who tried, 30% made a total of 12 purchases, and in the second 3% made 2 purchases.  These are the pies)) <br><br><hr>  The author is <a href="http://twitter.com/thebrainlady">@thebrainlady</a> , the translator is <a href="http://twitter.com/lexxscorp">@lexxscorp</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/101219/">https://habr.com/ru/post/101219/</a></p>
