Well, you understand - I'm lazy, and now I can immediately give a link to this text, instead of the next repetition, several times already formulated answers.  The article does not claim to universality - this is only my view on the situation.  At the same time, I will say that when you conduct interviews, you hire and train project managers, there are quite a lot of common criteria that answer the question ‚ÄúBut what does IT project manager really need to know and be able to do?‚Äù In order to work successfully in IT .

      By the way, knowledge of English is not even discussed in the article.  It is simply a must. <br><br>  Go? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As usual the request looks like: <br><blockquote>  Alexey, good afternoon!  My name is &lt;...&gt;.  I was advised to contact you &lt;...&gt;.  I need your expert advice.  I would be grateful for your hint.  Found a training for project managers that you read.  I would like to ask whether I should pass it.  Briefly about my situation: &lt;...&gt; I would like to try to develop myself further in the project direction, but already in the IT sphere.  Already passed several interviews, but so far unsuccessful (employers often refer to the fact that there is no experience in IT).  In this regard, I had an idea about how to make the train start moving all the same.  I would be very grateful for advice about the courses.  Perhaps it makes sense to look at something adjacent to the project manager, if there is no chance to be taken to the IT field for such a position?  I would be grateful for any feedback. </blockquote><br>  Call options differ only in previous experience in some non-IT areas. <br><br>  What can I advise? <br><br>  First, scare and thicken the clouds. <br><br>  1. Indeed, almost always they are denied exactly because for the project manager in IT it is extremely important to understand not only project management as such, but also IT.  This is required for exactly two things: a) to find a <b>common language with subordinates</b> (testers, analysts and developers who are all IT professionals) and therefore an understanding of the essence of the dialogues, specifications, problems, etc., and b) to find a <b>common language with customer representatives</b> who Often, they also mostly have an IT background.  Of course, there are some small chances to convince the future employer that understanding the specifics of the IT field is not critical for this position.  It is important to remember that these chances are very, very small.  Still, the employer knows better what he needs, and convincing him of something else is quite difficult.  Especially employers in IT - they certainly know what kind of employee they need.  At the same time, no one forbids trying to convince.  Suddenly work? <br><br>  2. In IT, it is very important to understand the stages of product development (SDLC - Software Development Life Cycle).  Working in non-IT organizations this understanding is <b>completely</b> impossible to get, alas.  There are moments specific to the IT industry.  And since the project manager in IT is responsible for the development of a product / code / functional by a given date, with a given quality and within a given framework for quality / functionality, then he must understand how to achieve all this with the means that he usually has in IT sphere.  Other industries may have their own nuances that differ from IT in one direction or another. <br><br>  3. Any project management training ‚Äúgenerally‚Äù will most likely not help much.  Looking for project management training in IT.  Let me explain why I think so: trainings ‚Äúin general‚Äù will not give an understanding of two important things: ‚ÄúIT technical language‚Äù and ‚Äúunderstanding of the development stages in IT‚Äù. <br><br>  4. In any IT company, there are already employees who want to become managers.  And these employees (developers, testers, analysts) are already versed in IT (speak the same technical language as others), and also know the SDLC.  Moreover, they know the customer, they know the specifics of the company and its internal kitchen (these are not critical points, but comparing with zero knowledge of an external candidate - even these points can outweigh).  Thus, it turns out that the external candidate NOT from the IT industry has to compete with both internal candidates from within the company itself and other external candidates, also from the IT industry. <br><br>  So, what are the parameters turned out? <br><br>  1. <b>Proficiency in technical IT language</b> .  Understanding, for example, what generally is FTP, Signoff, Sprint, ASAP, Regression, XML, Database request, Deadline, FYI, Client-Server Architecture, Redline, Smoke Test, FTE, Release ... The list is endless.  Being super expert in some of the things mentioned is not at all required.  It requires an understanding of what this is all about, what the terms are, what they mean, what is behind them, otherwise you would be like a blind person in the world of the sighted. <br><br>  2. <b>Knowledge of SDLC</b> (Software Development Life Cycle) - stages of software development.  And not just knowledge, but understanding why exactly such stages, why exactly in this order, where and why you can jump from one stage to another and whether it is possible to move along these stages in the opposite direction, and if so, when and under what conditions . <br><br>  3. <b>Methodological skills of project and people management (PM Hard Skills)</b> .  This includes knowledge of methodologies, management principles and processes by region.  Such as Agile, Scrum, Kanban, Waterfall, Communication management, Specification &amp; Requirements management, Change management, Risk management, Reporting, etc.  The good news is that one way or another can be learned through appropriate trainings, webinars and a variety of materials available online. <br><br>  4. <b>Personal skills of project and people management (PM Soft Skills)</b> .  These include Team &amp; Client management skills, Ability to solve complex tasks, Communication skills, Feedback skills, Ability to hear, listen and understand, Self-criticism, Leadership skills, Ability to explain, Professional culture (e-mails, calls), Ability to explain, Pro-activity, Task management skills, Delegation skills , Execution control skills, Personal effectiveness, Time management skills.  The second good news is that all this can also be learned through appropriate training. <br><br>  We will create a pivot table in which there will be three candidates: <br><ol><li>  external without knowledge of the IT industry </li><li>  external with knowledge of the IT industry </li><li>  internal with knowledge of the IT industry and the specifics of the company </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/995/096/1fa/9950961fa9d9e8ff33fdd94a98d92532.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Thus, it becomes obvious at which points you can try to compete. <br><br>  My opinion is that without immersion in the IT-environment it is impossible to master the IT language, at least at the level of understanding.  So there is no point in competing with the first item.  You (external non-IT candidate) are guaranteed to lose here.  The remaining three areas - quite amenable to competition.  And if the second (knowledge of SDLC) also requires immersion in the environment for a full understanding, then at least you can learn how to understand it without working in IT.  The lack of knowledge of SDLC can be compensated by the knowledge of an intelligent technical lead, an architect, and indeed any technically literate person from your future team.  But to find a common language with such a person and get his help - you need very serious skills in PM Soft Skills. <br><br>  There are PM Hard Skills and PM Soft Skills - and these are exactly the areas where a non-IT candidate can significantly outplay a candidate from the IT industry.  Why do I think so?  Many IT executives have grown out of developers, analysts, and testers.  Yes, there are some very cool specialists among them.  Many such candidates for managers in the IT industry - at heart they remain the same programmers, analysts and testers.  And this suggests that just PM Hard and Soft Skills, they may be developed less than the external candidate.  After all, both of these areas (PM Hard Skills and PM Soft Skills) do not depend on IT specifics.  They can and should be developed regardless of the area where you are currently working. <br><br>  In the end, what happens?  What could be our summary table, so that an external candidate who has not previously worked in IT has a chance? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/caf/34d/57f/caf34d57fe55f3ca07c698ea7907bed3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  An action plan that can help (and may not help).  But if you do nothing at all - it does not help guaranteed. <br><br>  1. Talk to someone from the EXCLUSIVE friends IT specialists (developers, testers, analysts, and even better team leads or managers) about SDLC.  Additionally read about it on the Internet.  It may be worth talking more than once and not even two. <br><br>  2. Try to choose the role of a project manager‚Äôs assistant in IT, or the role of a junior PMO-specialist (knowledge of management processes is more important than knowledge of stages and nuances and development terms).  Having got into any of these roles, it will be necessary to study the terminology and specifics of IT from the inside, if there really is a strong desire to move and develop in this particular area. <br><br>  3. Explain at the interview that ‚ÄúYour strengths are the ability to resolve conflicts, the skill of working with difficult situations, success in negotiations, knowledge of the English language.  And you will close technical gaps in knowledge at the expense of correct communication and help from technical specialists who will be your subordinates.  After all, working with people is your thing. ‚Äù  About these words.  It is important that this is really true about strengths, not bravado for interviewing.  Believe me - any intelligent leader will determine at the interview, if you cheat.  And this is all over.  But let's say you got the job - then you urgently need to find an ally among the techies who will help you fully cover and regularly explain the technical side of the job, the tasks and the difficulties that arise. <br><br>  Roughly speaking - you + techie ally will be such a team manager for two heads (maybe allies will need more than one).  Many hiring managers (your future boss) understand this and may not want to go for it, because you will ‚Äúeat off‚Äù the time of technical specialists, which will reduce the productivity of the team as a whole.  So, your lack of certain skills and knowledge will be on one side of the scale, and on the other side, your future leader will weigh the possible decrease in the efficiency and productivity of the team you are planning to take.  And the more will outweigh the bowl of efficiency - the less chance that you will take.  Consider it. <br><br>  Summarizing.  To compete with the guys who understand IT and also strive to become project managers, you must seriously surpass them in PM Soft Skills. <br><br>  <i>PS: the original of this article (and other interesting materials) can be read in my blog: <a href="http://consultpm.com/">consultpm.com</a></i> <br>  <i>PPS: I reasonably noticed that IT is not limited to development.</i>  <i>It's right.</i>  <i>In this case, the second point (knowledge of SDLC) will be less significant, or completely replaced by some of its own, specific to your direction.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  Share this article with friends. <br>  Thank you and success to you! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290624/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290624/</a></p>
