  <section class="page js-page"><h1>7 conclusions self-taught programmer for 1 year</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I once promised here that I will share my professional achievements.  Well.  In a week, it will be exactly one year since I work as a web software developer at my second company, and I would like to share my observations - maybe they will seem funny to someone and I hope even informative.  At once I will say that theses will be general and do not apply to any particular place or situation.  So. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Monday </h4><br>  Self-taught programmer can be.  Those who tell you that you will not learn anything yourself, but you need education ... ignore.  Even if you are an artist by training, you can learn how to be a programmer yourself.  I will tell you more.  I think a programmer is better off being self-taught.  Why you ask?  Because in this outstanding profession you need to cultivate every day at least an hour and a half, and better all night.  The fact is that the science of programming is constantly evolving and iterating, which means that we boldly forget the old methods and master the new ones.  Therefore, if you think that, having received 5 years of education, it will be possible to reap the benefits all your life - no.  It is impossible and will not be. <br><br><h4>  Tuesday </h4><br>  There is only one type of people with whom I envy white envy - applied mathematics.  But returning to the first point, I decided that it was not only interesting to learn mathematics on my own, but also zashib as useful.  Starting with discrete mathematics, I discovered an amazing thing - if you not only learn, but also strain your brain over interesting puzzles, it starts to think about the MIRACLE many times faster.  As it was written somewhere, if you love what you do, sooner or later you get into the stream and what you do becomes very simple and intuitive.  You.  Although a year ago you would have been horrified at the sight of it all.  But ease is the next barrier. <br><br><h4>  Wednesday </h4><br>  If it becomes quite easy - then you grew up and stand still.  If you stop, your growth will stop.  If it became easy, the head as if tells you that you can relax a little friend and dive again into that maelstrom of psychological discomfort where you don‚Äôt understand anything, but it‚Äôs so interesting and you want to master, understand, master, defeat this piece of iron, which puts you again and again new challenges.  I would divide the work into such stages: Nothing is clear and the horror is so difficult.  Oh, it seems that something turns out for me and E my what I did before all day did in 10 minutes, now I‚Äôll finish it to work better.

    <h4>  Thursday </h4><br>  When I started, I thought that I would be taught.  I thought to ask questions normally.  And my teachers grumbled and denied.  And then I understood one very important thing in the work of a programmer-joon: do not ask questions to a colleague.  Ask them Google.  A person needs to draw experience unobtrusively, in conversation, when you are in the workplace discussing something.  But when the question is direct, and besides it concerns the solution of your problem ... Google is really the best companion.  In addition, if you still do not understand people in our time have received the greatest superpower.  Think about it.  You just have to ask a question, and the answer lies before your eyes on the monitor plane.  Sync ebout zis, gais. <br><br><h4>  Friday </h4><br>  We all govnodim anyway.  Whether by laziness or ignorance.  Govnokodim, because, waking up tomorrow, I will be smarter than yesterday, and the written code will remain the day before yesterday.  Do not be shy of the fact that you are getting better.  But do not leave your code bad, if you know that it is.  I‚Äôll say right away: if you open a project, and there is a continuous shit code: it's time to make legs.  Look for a place where govnokoda less.  I happened to sharply compare the code of different people and this is how to read Oscar Wilde and a yellow newspaper article.  It is difficult to love the beautiful when your brain and eyes are raped.  But most importantly, understand that everyone is shitty - even the most experienced people.  But it is necessary to write in such a way that as few specialists as possible take your job as a hard-working assertion. <br><br><h4>  Saturday </h4><br>  Read recognized books, learn patterns, and at least try to work on them.  If a colleague talks about something, and you catch yourself thinking that you do not know this ... congratulations!  This means that in the evening we, with the enthusiasm of a maniac, will sit down to google about what he was talking about and the next time the situations where you feel like a moron will be one less.  Chat with colleagues.  Joke, argue.  The bold plus of the work of an office programmer is the very communication that the freelaser is forever lacking. <br><br><h4>  Sunday </h4><br>  I'm in love with my job.  Every day I enjoy running to the office and scrolling through my head what needs to be done.  I dream that once the whole world is proud of what I have done and why prevaricate everyone should want to be the best and this is probably the most important thing that I would advise you in this wonderful profession. <br><br>  Yes.  The year was not in vain.  This time I was clearly not mistaken with the choice of profession.  In a great mood.  Fuh.  Rested.  Time again to take up the math. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/340044/">https://habr.com/ru/post/340044/</a></p>
