And I have a theory on this.  The fact that Acer produces a lot of models.  And the models for their stuffing, and the parameters are very different.  Among the huge number of laptops, which is natural, there are both unsuccessful and very unsuccessful ones (I met with myself). <br>  However, a large number of products also means a large number of good, high-quality and balanced models.  You just have to take the search with due responsibility (I personally needed a week of daily Google requests and review to stay on this laptop). <br><br> <a href="http://fastpic.ru/view/6/2010/0505/e00a401b37df999f108eb39e2ac0c740.jpg.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/937/1a9/af1/9371a9af1c0c5f2a340716587a173aa6.jpg"></a> <br><br>  So, how I chose it.  Well, probably, like everyone.  That everything was cool, but not expensive.  I was very important: <br>  - Long battery life (I use it more often on the road than at home) <br>  - Big screen (I have a vision and so not everything is in order) <br>  - Relatively light weight (again, because there are so many where to carry it) <br>  - Productivity is above average (I'm not going to play on it, in general, I am not going to, but it is possible to keep ten heavyweight programs open at the same time) <br>  - low price

      Well, the little things, of course, the normal amount of memory (not miserable 250 GB), beautiful design, etc. <br>  In some strange way, the <b>Acer Aspire Timeline 5810TG-944G64Mi</b> meets all the listed requirements. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Specifications </h4>  <b>Processor:</b> Intel Core 2 Duo 1400 MHz Penryn (SU9400) <br>  <b>Bus:</b> 800 MHz 3 Mb L2 Cache <br>  <b>RAM:</b> 4096 MB DDR3-1066 MHz <br>  <b>Screen:</b> 15.6 "LED Mirror (Glare) <br>  <b>Resolution:</b> (1366x768) WXGA + <br>  <b>Video card:</b> ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4330, 512 + 1757 MB <br>  <b>Sound Card:</b> Intel High-Definition Audio <br>  <b>Hard Drive:</b> 640 GB (5400 rpm), SATA <br>  <b>CD drive:</b> DVD ¬± RW (DL) <br>  <b>Communication:</b> lan 10/100/1000 <br>  <b>Wireless:</b> Bluetooth, WiFi (802.11a / b / g) <br>  <b>Ports:</b> 3xUSB (2.0), Kensington security, Line out (S / PDIF support), HDMI, Mic-in, VGA <br>  Expansion Slots: Card Reader (SD / MMC / MS / Pro / xD) <br>  <b>Additional devices:</b> Camera (1.0) <br>  <b>Input Devices:</b> Windows CL-ra, Touch Pad Touch Pad <br>  <b>Battery:</b> Li-Ion 8700 mAh (up to 12 hours) <br>  <b>Weight:</b> 2.4 kg <br>  <b>Color:</b> Brown <br>  <b>Keyboard Color:</b> Black <br>  <b>Body (L x W x H):</b> 378x259x29 mm <br>  <b>Software:</b> MS Windows 7 Home Premium (64-bit) <br><br> <a href="http://fastpic.ru/view/6/2010/0505/9886a9941811b286137d3811fe30deda.jpg.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c0f/c22/7a4/c0fc227a47d57280d57c5ebeace2d0b5.jpg"></a> <br><br><h4>  About battery and video cards </h4>  On the case under the keyboard there is a sticker that says ‚Äú12+‚Äù shortly and clearly.  It's about the battery life of a laptop.  I don‚Äôt know about the plus, but for 11 hours it worked for me exactly on the integrated video card. <br>  In general, this notebook has two video cards.  One, ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4330, is strong (compared to the other) and consumes a lot of energy.  The second, built-in Intel-ovsky, seems to be weak, and consumes significantly less energy.  Thanks to the pre-installed utility from Acer, you can switch between the two cards manually and automatically (depending on the load on the system, etc.). <br>  I don‚Äôt know, I built 1080i HDTV video without any problems. <br><br>  <i>Unfortunately, Linux cannot boast of maintaining long work (I tried OpenSuse, Debian, Ubuntu, set it up as I could).</i>  <i>Under the same conditions, Windows 7 provides approximately one and a half times more battery life.</i>  <i>But this is more a software issue.</i> <br><br> <a href="http://fastpic.ru/view/6/2010/0505/399581d7ec88e708105bd59a5050396c.jpg.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0d8/2a5/ba6/0d82a5ba637cb225a7e0d2aa0084d16e.jpg"></a> <br><br><h4>  Appearance and keyboard </h4>  Despite the fact that everywhere this laptop is sold in a brown case, it is almost impossible to find photos in which it would be visible.  This led me to make these poor photos myself. <br>  Overall, a very stylish laptop, and very comfortable.  Large (within reason) the distance between the buttons, which makes it extremely simple process of vacuuming.  The keys themselves are rather large and pleasantly respond to pressing.  In the third week, the F7 key popped up, but it was inserted back within a few seconds. <br>  What's a little confusing is why the touchpad is to the left of the middle.  As if it was created specifically for left-handers.  However, you can get used to it very quickly, and for the most part I still use a USB mouse. <br><br> <a href="http://fastpic.ru/view/6/2010/0505/8deb87ec4a2dfc7f93eb7654ede1cc59.jpg.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d90/d6a/eb8/d90d6aeb8effbb9c901f23857d0d9210.jpg"></a> <br><br><h4>  Performance </h4>  Well, it can be fully understood from the technical specifications.  RAM memory is enough, the processor is above average.  The video card (which is from ATI) is standard for many laptops.  Stress tests my computer did not.  All I can say, NHL09 at maximum settings is easy :) <br>  Blunt and freezes were not observed (well, at least having an ‚Äúiron‚Äù character). <br><br> <a href="http://fastpic.ru/view/6/2010/0505/88eaa4f6e3244db4198627ef4e2e6560.png.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/571/aca/52e/571aca52eac528afb78e4e1dcfb98dcb.jpg"></a> <br><br><h4>  Size and weight </h4>  For its parameters and 15.6 "screen, in my opinion, the weight is more than good: 2.4 kg.  It is very easy and comfortable to wear a backpack on your back, even for several hours a day. <br>  Width-length is usual for such a screen, but the thickness is impressive - only 29 mm. <br><br> <a href="http://fastpic.ru/view/6/2010/0505/6d5036c6d332055172ca156c911f1ce2.jpg.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a91/6bd/4d6/a916bd4d663ca696929dce6468dcfd3a.jpg"></a> <br><br><h4>  Price </h4>  If we turn to <a href="">Yandex.Market</a> , we see that the price, for the most part, ranges from 33 to 34 thousand rubles.  Very much and not much, I think.  By the way, in offline stores this model is not easy to find. <br><br><h4>  The result and a teaspoon of tar </h4>  In my opinion, the quality / price ratio of this laptop is very high.  Even nothing more to say.  Serious cons not found.  Minor cons list here: <br>  - It gets dirty easily, but it is also easily cleaned with a single movement of a soft cloth.  BUT <br>  - I didn‚Äôt quite like the fact that the battery right under the screen protrudes about 1.5 cm from the case. <br>  - During charging from the network it is very hot. <br><br> <a href="http://fastpic.ru/view/6/2010/0505/0d3d4ab38808918d2edd2cab3352ce6d.jpg.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/366/71b/84c/36671b84c63f8b5c765413ba79aed35f.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92821/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92821/</a></p>
