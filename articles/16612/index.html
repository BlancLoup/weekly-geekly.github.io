V.V.  Putin in front of his supporters, finally convinced me that under no circumstances would I vote for United Russia. <br>  This hypocritical lie that we hear from the mouth of the head of state, acts as an anti-advertising Putin. <br>  Putin has been ruling our state, in the form of the prime minister and president, already ~ 9 years old and at the same time he opposes himself to Gaidar, Chubais and Nemtsov, although for all 9 years comrade.  Putin continued the reforms initiated in our state by this team.  Why so straight to lie. <br>  The current economic well-being of Russia owes much to the capitalist reforms that Yeltsin, Gaidar, Chubais and Nemtsov carried out in the 90s, and it is shameless to write them as a scapegoat during the transition from Socialism to Capitalism .  And today, the result of large-scale economic reforms suddenly Comrade.  V.V.  Putin ascribes himself personally, creating a cult of his personality - that he is a superman who alone could make Russia prosperous.  But Yeltsin, Gaidar, Chubais and Nemtsov, who started the reforms, suddenly became enemies of our fatherland.  I am ashamed to Comrade.  Putin, behave like in kindergarten. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And what has Putin really done during these 9 years that he has been in power: <br>  - quarreled with all the modern developed countries of the West; <br>  - But it befriended Russia with all the terrorist and communist powers - the DPRK, Iran, Pakistan, Palestine, Lebanon, Venezuela, etc .; <br>  - He brought the economy up to 11% of annual inflation, today the government is already beginning to regulate prices as it was in the USSR; <br>  - The vectors of foreign and domestic politics of today's Russia are aimed at the same goals that the USSR had in the 70s: ( <br><br>  For me, it is obvious that Putin is building Russia along the lines of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, so that the economy looks like capitalism, and the political system is built along the lines of the CPSU.  Putin has not yet finished his reforms along the lines of the People's Republic of China; therefore, he suggests that we hold a referendum to support the continuation of his course. <br>  I do not want to return to the scoop that Comrade is preparing for us  Putin with his Komsomol members.  And I do not want to live as people live in China, it is enough to climb on the I-no and read which areas of the life of their citizens are controlled by the Chinese Communist Party: almost everything - from the Internet to religious life. <br>  Therefore, capitalist Chubais is better for me than Putin‚Äôs Communist Party. <br>  I personally at this referendum - December 2 - I want to say Comrade.  Thanks to Putin, and farewell: Russia without Putin!

      <b>PS:</b> <br>  I usually never sympathized with the liberal parties. <br>  But this time, <b>‚ÄúSPS‚Äù</b> seems to me the only real opposition of the Kremlin national party and the looming ‚Äúbrown plague‚Äù (the current behavior of V.P.P. and his Party, very much resembles Germany in 1934). <br>  SPS will not be able to occupy&gt; 50% of the State Duma, so I am not afraid that the party formed by Chubais will again rule the country.  But I really want that there would be an Oppositional opinion in the State Duma, then perhaps there will be less nonsense and maybe totalitarianism will not work (although this is fantastic). <br>  Concerning other parties: <br>  one).  <b>"United Russia"</b> is not for me, because it is a complete lie.  This is the ruling party that builds a totalitarian society in Russia.  This is the party that raised the terrible corruption in Russia.  Any serious matter can be done only for huge bribes and at the same time VVP.  says that ‚Äúenemies‚Äù are to blame for corruption ... <br>  2).  <b>‚ÄúFair Russia‚Äù</b> - the former ‚ÄúPensioners Party‚Äù, the obvious brainchild of VVP.  Inside the party itself, it is called ‚ÄúPutin‚Äôs Left Foot.‚Äù  The leader of this party, Mironov, wants the most.  for 3 terms, and knows most about the Kremlin operation "Receiver".  The goal set by the Kremlin for this party: by means of socialist slogans, select the electorate from the "Communist Party of the Russian Federation"; <br>  3).  <b>‚ÄúDemocratic Party of Russia‚Äù</b> is in my opinion another brainchild of the Kremlin.  In this election campaign, this party submitted to the CEC a requirement to remove the ‚ÄúSPS‚Äù from the elections for a TV spot pouring dirt on United Russia and on VVP.  (cool, they protect the owner).  Obviously the goal set by the Kremlin for this party: to select the electorate from "SPS"; <br>  four).  <b>The Communist Party of the Russian Federation</b> and <b>the Agrarian Party of Russia</b> are not parties controlled by the Kremlin, but they are not for me.  I would generally judge and forbade the communist ideology as Fascism; <br>  five).  <b>‚ÄúYabloko‚Äù</b> - everything is simpler here, I don‚Äôt sympathize with G. Yavlinsky‚Äôs personality.  He is ill with pride and sorry he is blue (he was seen more than once in the "blue" bars), and my moral principles do not allow me to support such a politician. <br>  6).  <b>‚ÄúLDPR‚Äù</b> is one of the first Pro-Kremlin parties, created even under Gorbachev for the appearance of the opposition.  V.V.  Zhirinovsky is a colonel (now probably the general) of the KGB, and all the important demarches and votes of the Liberal Democratic Party are coordinated with the Kremlin (people who personally knew VV Zhirinovsky told). <br>  Although today reading the appeal V.V.  Zhirinovsky to the citizens of Russia can be annoyed by the actions of the Kremlin and I even found such words in the appeal: ‚ÄúThey are sure that the people can be ignored ... [And the people] They want to choose leaders at all levels and decide themselves what parties we will have what a democracy, what an economy.  Time calls us to it.  <b>Last Calls!</b>  "; <br>  7).  Well, all the other parties, obviously, will not be able to get into the State Duma: ( </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/16612/">https://habr.com/ru/post/16612/</a></p>
