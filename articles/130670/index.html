  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Refusal to write - progress or regress?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The last time there is talk about whether it is necessary to learn to write by hand at all, if everything goes to the great bright future, when there will be only electronic devices, and the trees will finally be left alone and will not be translated into paper.  Here are some considerations, the respected community. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Not so long ago in schools they wrote fountain pens, and the same conversations arose in connection with the transition to ballpoint pens.  It seems nothing happened, crossed.  And I personally think that the level of calligraphy immediately fell.  It was the pen that influenced in its time the form of letters in fonts, which are commonly called humanistic, when the width of the lines in the letter is different and depends on the angle at which the wide-necked pen or what pressing force is when writing with a pointed pen.  Ballpoint pen is a great and practical thing.  But the letter has become less elegant - it is a fact. <br><br>  Now more and more often it is a question of rejecting a letter.  I do not know about you, but I personally am not happy with such a prospect.  Here are a few moments offhand.

      1. The development of fine motor skills.  I think it is difficult to argue with the importance of fine motor skills for the development of a child.  A child and a pencil are two absolutely inseparable things in my opinion.  Calligraphy is universal in this case.  And physically develops, and mentally.  I personally do not see any normal alternatives.  Rattling a finger on the touch screen of the iPad does not replace pencil and paper.  As an entertainment option - perhaps. <br><br>  2. You write - you remember.  When I was in school, the hard-to-remember things that require more memorization than understanding, I sometimes just took and rewritten in notebooks.  Memorization increased many times. <br><br>  3. Drawing - the continuation of writing.  If we cancel the letter, then what to do with the picture?  He still needs to learn to "live".  And the tablet in this case is already just an additional convenient tool.  All familiar designers must train their hands on "live" drawings.  And many sketches are made by hand, scanned, and only afterwards with ‚Äúwakom‚Äù they bring to mind. <br><br>  4. Think - you draw.  Until now, I can not accustom myself to ‚Äúreflect‚Äù on the computer.  What does not matter what it is - a prototype, an idea, a text or something else.  I take a clean sheet and draw.  Although it is possible a matter of habit. <br><br>  5. Signature.  Crosses will be set?  ;) <br><br>  6. And if I want to pass a secret note?  Via skype?  ;) <br><br>  7. Sometimes it is easier to explain something differently by drawing on paper. <br><br>  The list can be continued. <br><br>  In general, handwriting is one of the components of individuality.  I will not be original if I say that, in terms of handwriting, much can be said about a person.  And this is probably the general trend towards de-individualization of society. <br><br>  Handwriting can remain the lot of designers, artists, illustrators, and, say, a highly educated part of the population.  Those.  in a sense, literacy and writing can once again leave the broad masses. <br><br>  It seems to me that the refusal of the letter - it is still a regression. <br><br>  But from the paper document really give up would not hurt, and it would be a serious progress. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130670/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130670/</a></p>
