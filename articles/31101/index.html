What people do not understand is that they will get rich local functionality, I mean, we put on it;  Despite the fact that you also get more natural devices in addition to speech and vision, it is solely a matter of combining local functionality with the functionality that surrounds us. <br>  The moment you look at a device, say, that connects to a TV or car, there are much more lightweight devices to interact with the Internet, but when you sit in front of a full-screen device, say, to edit a document or create something, you know it seems to me that we are closer than ever to making it much more convenient. </td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/195/2e0/bfd/1952e0bfd991bc0380e247152bb90de0.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Steve jobs" hspace="10" vspace="10"></td><td>  I will give you a specific example.  I love Google Maps, I use it on a computer, you know, in a browser.  But when we created the iPhone, we thought: ‚ÄúWouldn't it be great if you make cards on the iPhone?‚Äù.  And we contacted Google, and they made several clients for Java phones, and they had an API, on which we also worked a little bit.  And we finished writing an application that would work with this API.  And they will provide the final service.  And the application that we wrote, given the fact that for us it is very important, overshadows any application for Google Maps.  This is how it is.  The same information comes from the server, but what you get is unbelievable.  It is much better than for a computer and from a completely different opera compared to what they previously provided for phones. <br>  And, you know, this is the result of using a large number of technologies in the application.  Therefore, when we show it to people, it blows down the tower to them by how well this app is.  And in the browser you do not succeed. <br>  Therefore, people are trying to understand how to be able to do more in the browser, how to get the opportunity to continue working when you fly out of the Internet, how to use such applications in general, so that work continues, regardless of the connection. <br>  But all this is happening very slowly, and there is still a lot that can be done with functionally rich applications.  At the same time, hardware is progressing so that you can use applications on, every time, more and less expensive, and, every time, less and less energy-intensive devices.  And therefore there are interesting things that can be done with the help of customers. </td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/5bf/2b0/31a/5bf2b031a6cc8a96cefb3f7bc5c7979c.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Walt mossberg" hspace="10" vspace="10"></td><td>  Good.  That is, you say that applications still mean something, but maybe I misunderstood you, but you are talking about a client who is not a personal computer, in any case, as we present it today. </td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/195/2e0/bfd/1952e0bfd991bc0380e247152bb90de0.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Steve jobs" hspace="10" vspace="10"></td><td> I say that the crossing of really great applications and great services is very strong, and now it can be much stronger than just using a browser. </td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/7ea/af4/d4d/7eaaf4d4de807cb665206147aff24871.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Kara swisher" hspace="10" vspace="10"></td><td>  So you say that being a software company and a service company, unlike ... </td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/195/2e0/bfd/1952e0bfd991bc0380e247152bb90de0.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Steve jobs" hspace="10" vspace="10"></td><td>  I say that these services plus a more sophisticated application is very powerful. </td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/5bf/2b0/31a/5bf2b031a6cc8a96cefb3f7bc5c7979c.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Walt mossberg" hspace="10" vspace="10"></td><td>  Bill? </td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/378/529/c67/378529c67a66f2cbba34ff5f45228a36.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Bill gates" hspace="10" vspace="10"></td><td>  Yes, from the point of view of architecture, the question is the following - you only use online software and everything you downloaded is a browser?  And the same question about the phone, because  This is a full-screen device.  There will always be different screen sizes, since  there exists, say, a 5 ‚Äùscreen, which cannot be compared at all with a 20‚Äù screen, as well as with a huge screen that hangs in the living room.  These things, beyond their limits, will be computed, all connected to the Internet, but the idea that you get a local response instantly regardless of delays and connection limitations, what you get when you use it and the fact that it all happens out of your sight, This is what leads to real balance. </td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/7ea/af4/d4d/7eaaf4d4de807cb665206147aff24871.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Kara swisher" hspace="10" vspace="10"></td><td>  What will the device look like in 5 years?

It seems to us that one company cannot do everything at once.  So you have to work with companies that are very good at all of this.  For example, we are not, but I mean that maybe Microsoft is very good at finding.  And we are not.  We are not trying to become cool in the search, so we work with people who are very good at it.  And we do not know how to make cards.  We know how to make the best card client in the world, but we do not know how to make such a service, so we cooperate with those who know.  And what we want to do is provide the user with the device and experience wrapped around all this information, and provide him with a holistic product with a great interface. <br>  And therefore, in some cases, we have to do more work than others.  As, for example, in the case of iTunes, there was no service for delivering music that would be good enough, and we had to do it.  But in other cases, there are companies that deal with such things much better than us, because we are not so good at this, and we are pleased to cooperate with them selectively.  And it seems to me that it is very difficult for one company to do all this.  Life is a complicated thing. </td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/7ea/af4/d4d/7eaaf4d4de807cb665206147aff24871.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Kara swisher" hspace="10" vspace="10"></td><td>  Let's talk about entertainment.  Entertainment is an important industry for your companies.  Your company has music, and now also Apple TV.  Microsoft is present in the era of Hollywood.  Where do you see the era of YouTube lead?  We had a couple of networkers here, talking about the changes taking place in Hollywood and everything else.  What is happening with the provision of entertainment, and what exactly are you connected to?  You will still be one of the delivery mechanisms for most people, in one way or another. </td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/378/529/c67/378529c67a66f2cbba34ff5f45228a36.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Bill gates" hspace="10" vspace="10"></td><td>  Well, the starting point in this case is the Internet, and therefore you provide all its richness and interactivity.  I think we can slightly imagine the future of television, if we look at communities such as, for example, Xbox Live, where people communicate with each other, find friends, watch something together and talk about it. <br>  If you transform all this into genres, be it educational shows, or sports programs, or watching the Olympic Games, or elections, the ability to navigate becomes very, very strong.  And we are not in the entertainment sector.  Yes, we create Halo, which is a very serious video game, but mainly we create a platform, and everything depends only on the program, what it is: speech, or color, or beautiful graphics, this is what makes these things happen for 10 years as IPTV, it took 10 years to create it.  And now this, in the end, is beginning to bear fruit, and there are companies such as AT &amp; T, for example, that bet on combining such things. <br>  Therefore, we are just at the very beginning of creating a machine for large-scale entertainment, mainly through a PC, and, unfortunately, in most cases not connected to TV, but this is the innovation, and now such things as IPTV and Xbox are combined in the living room. </td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/5bf/2b0/31a/5bf2b031a6cc8a96cefb3f7bc5c7979c.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Walt mossberg" hspace="10" vspace="10"></td><td>  Bill, you were not present at the same time, but Steve showed Apple TV, which displays video from YouTube directly on the TV.  Will there be something of you in the same spirit?<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Do you see yourself, as Bill said, providing opportunities for entertainment, or would I rather say, put off the role of Disney in favor of the role of Apple? </font></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/195/2e0/bfd/1952e0bfd991bc0380e247152bb90de0.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Steve Jobs" hspace="10" vspace="10"></td><td><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I think that people want to enjoy their entertainment the way they want it, and when they want it, and on the device they want. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, in the long run, all this will lead to the fact that entertainment companies will have to resort to different business models.</font></font> And this is good.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I mean, if you're a content company, then that's good. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Many people want to enjoy your content more often and in different ways, that's why you keep in business, but the transition</font></font></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
