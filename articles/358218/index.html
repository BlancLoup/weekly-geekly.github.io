In a briefing interview with Product Advisor, Ivan Zamesin shared on the Epic Growth Story project how to quickly test hypotheses and collect feedback from users with the help of Customer Development. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S4Caewhq250" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Watch the interview and read the notes under the cut. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Growth hack in the product? <br></h3><br>  When I was responsible for the Yandex.kartin interface, in 2013 we had another page-based interface.  The interface looked sad, bad and hard.  We rolled out the UX-interface and tried to do a lot of different experiments.  One of the experiments is image search.  I had the idea to change the frame color of the picture from white to black and the text color, respectively, too.  We implemented this change in 5 minutes and got plus 10% to our metric - the number of images viewed per session.  For such an inert thing as a search with 5 million DAU is a multiple growth.

    <h3>  Growth story that inspires? <br></h3><br>  Rather, I am inspired by such processes, when all the guys are bored on one metric, they very quickly start the process, promptly cut out the hypotheses to the lowest possible and check them with custom, prototypes, inexpensive experiments and the cheapest solutions.  First test one hypothesis per month, then one and a half, two, three, four.  Inspires when a team goes to such a pace.  This is the process I bring to all businesses that I advise. <br><br><h3>  How to test a hypothesis? <br></h3><br>  Very often, product teams think with features.  Hypothesis is a feature that solves the need of the user.  At the stage of the Job Story hypothesis testing - half of these hypotheses die.  Job Story gives you an understanding of whether you need to implement this feature or not.  And most importantly, there is no need to invest in the development and spend a lot of money on testing such experiments. <br><br>  When the Job Story is confirmed, the following is quick and easy - ask the user to make a socially expensive action, for example: ‚ÄúWrite a post on Facebook about what such a thing will be soon‚Äù, ‚ÄúSend to your friends on Instagram Direct‚Äù and so on.  The user must confirm by his actions that this is really important.  Passed through the confirmation, painted the layout, showed three people, again asked for confirmation.  Ok, this was confirmed, we made a knee-punch decision, got the money. <br><br>  At some stages you need more detail, some stages just skip.  There are complex things that the user just does not tell, for example, the referral system.  The referral system is hard to check by the castdev.  Here, rather, you need to invent the simplest MVP, run on scripts, lend users who use the interface, and look at the result. <br><br><h3>  Cool Customer Development? <br></h3><br>  The coolest custdev is the one you do, the bad custdev - which you don't.  CustDev is like a sport.  Everyone knows that you need to play sports, pump the size of your heart so that the walls become thin, and you don‚Äôt die of myocardial infarction, but no one does.  Same with CustDev.  Everyone knows that you need to talk to users, but there are always excuses not to do it. <br><br>  Do 4 interviews with users per week and you are handsome. <br><br><h3>  How to collect feedback from users? <br></h3><br>  The coolest feedback is when the user loads it himself in tons and you don‚Äôt need to do anything for it.  In all the teams, in all the businesses that I am currently consulting, I set up the processes when the feedback arrives by pushing.  Chatiki with users, for example.  It really works because you get feedback instantly on any subject of interest.  If you need to check the layouts, you throw in the chat layout with the question: ‚ÄúWhat do you see on this layout?  What can you do on this layout? ‚ÄùAnd specific questions about functionality.  And ask him to evaluate on a ten-point scale how much his need solves this. <br><br>  It is also useful to collect feedback in the sales process.  Sales managers after each sales session should write down theses why the customer bought or why did not buy.  These theses are important to share in general chat rooms.  Let them automatically fly to the Slack product, designer, team lead, developer, manager.  Talked to people, make a script so that with one click you could send all the insiders after the interview to an internal email.  Thus, the feedback will be constantly circulating. <br><br><h3>  How to make friends designer and product? <br></h3><br>  Once I watched a lecture that greatly changed my attitude to working with designers.  The point is this: a huge amount of value is inherent in the work of another person.  Here, the main thing is to remove your ego, understand the point of view of another person, and ask him a maximum of questions to determine why he formulated the problem in such a way, why such a mockup was sent, and so on.  You do not have the task to convince another person, your task is to grow the metric.  Be sure to generate ideas together, formulate tasks in terms of the Job Story.  The designer must know, at least, about what the product manager has talked with people, then he will take every micro solution a little better. <br><br><h3>  How does the day of the product start? <br></h3><br>  I always start with stand up, because stand up is a cool topic to load the context of the previous day of the team and adjust the context of the future.  Also, the product must have a lot of time to think.  Often I found myself in such a state, when all the day in meetings or in slots for ‚Äúwork‚Äù, and not even half an hour to sit and think: ‚ÄúOkay, what about our metric?‚Äù. <br><br><h3>  What book would you advise to read? <br></h3><br>  Required all books Intercom'a.  Intercom - just crazy devils, they focus themselves cool and broadcast to the outside world.  Books "Jobs to Be Done", "on Product Management", "on Starting Up".  Be sure to "StartUp", "Lean UX", "Pirate Metrics", "Inspired", "Ask Mom" ‚Äã‚Äãis the basis.  I also liked the book ‚ÄúSubtle art of pofigism‚Äù, in the original ‚ÄúThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck‚Äù.  In order to achieve success, you inevitably have to make a huge amount of mistakes.  You want - you do not want, you just need to make a large number of mistakes, and then choose such a sphere and such mistakes so that you don‚Äôt really hurt from them, but ideally so that you get pleasure. <br><br><h3>  Applications in your phone? <br></h3><br>  Email client Spark, Notion, Airtable, Rocket and Sber Bank, Point, Telegram, i love Clear - the best Todo due to the fact that it is possible to fix on 15% of the screen.  This is the coolest thing that happened in my application performance. <br><br><h3>  A cool example of a UX interface? <br></h3><br>  Airtable is a space thing, I take off my hat to the guys, they solved a difficult task with many levels of abstractions.  This is a database that you can very variably show: in the calendar, with a sign.  More scripts can be added.  Many functions and all of them are accessible and easily perceived by the user. <br><br><h3>  Why infobusiness, not a product? </h3><br>  I see a huge growth point in self-employed.  Yes, it is uncomfortable when you know that there is no guaranteed income, and you can earn nothing tomorrow.  This puts in such conditions in which you grow multiply faster. <br><br>  There is growth when you choose a more interesting project, in this project you struggle for more interesting responsibility, you achieve percentage growth of metrics - you are promoted and you grow by interest or tens of percent. <br><br>  And there is growth, when you risk - with high probability you fail, with some probability you grow.  And the trick of this growth is that you make multiple times more mistakes, like in the book ‚ÄúSubtle art of pofigism‚Äù, and you learn many times faster.  The stakes are higher and the result is also multiply higher. <br><br>  Ivan participated in the Epic Growth Story project - a Gett and Epic Growth Conference flash mob, where product and marketing experts share epic growth stories and grooves.  A selection of the best stories: egconf.ru/growthstory and in the Telegram channel <a href="https://t.me/epicgrowth">t.me/epicgrowth</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/358218/">https://habr.com/ru/post/358218/</a></p>
