A remake of your favorite iphone game</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day Khabrovchane. <br>  In this article I want to talk a little bit about my first project under the iPhone. <br>  It is more about thoughts (and feelings), rather than about technical aspects. <br>  The history of "one development" under the cut. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Start:</b> <br><br>  A few years ago as a student, I bought my first asus p535 communicator, the model attracted me because it had a good (for those times) screen which was very convenient to read books.  I always loved books very much, but it was inconvenient to read them at lectures, the size did not allow them to be disguised, the communicator with a palm was another matter.  But besides books, I discovered another interesting thing - games!  Racing, shooters, platformers - sideways, puzzle games and RPG seduced me.  There was one game that I especially loved - obulis.  Two parts, both played to the holes as they say.  50 most interesting levels for each.  In 2008, I learned that the guys who did obulis for the PDA ported their product to the PC and distribute it through Steam.  The feeling of rapture is back.  But as they say, all good things tend to end.  Levels passed 10 times, all secrets are open.  I want more, but nowhere to take.

      <b>Decision:</b> <br><br>  It is known that it is better to do that which pleases, that which brings pleasure.  In 2010, I was a bit tired of social games, if I‚Äôm quite honest, I couldn‚Äôt look at them anymore.  New ideas did not appear.  On one of the New Year's Eve January evenings, I dug into the appstore in search of something so interesting and addictive and remembered obulis.  Honestly, I had no doubt that the developers ported their game to such a successful platform, but as it turned out, I was wrong.  Rechecking on the American appstore made sure that the game is not there.  From this point on, you can say it all began.  I fired up to do something like this wonderful game. <br><br>  <b>About the game:</b> <br><br>  Everything is brilliant - simple.  We are given balls of different colors, they must be thrown into baskets of corresponding colors.  Balls are suspended on chains and ropes.  There is no way to influence the balls, you can only cut the ropes, thus causing the balls to move.  Levels are equipped with various obstacles and mechanisms.  Sometimes the solution can be seen immediately, and sometimes you have to experiment to find the right approach.  Passage of some levels is complicated by the fact that some objects here are set for beauty. <br><br>  <b>Development:</b> <br><br>  I myself do not know how to program at all.  I am the organizer. <br>  Earlier, I wrote that I was engaged in social games for the whole of 2010. <br>  The composition of my team: <br>  - 2 programmers <br>  - Painter <br>  - Sound (he is also a game designer) <br><br>  Before sharing my idea with them, I threw the bait.  He brought the PC distribution kit with one thing: "an interesting, addictive game."  The next day, everyone was playing at lunchtime, on the second day they boasted to each other who passed levels and shared tips on passing.  Nobody remained indifferent.  So I was convinced that I was moving in the right direction. <br><br>  Development began with compiling a table of assets and discussing the type of game. <br>  (I leave <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc%3Fkey%3D0AttzzIS7dIKfdHA0TVUxNkJGWHIxQ3Z1VnJ6eFhDbEE%26hl%3Den">here a</a> link to the first version of the document, for those who are interested) <br><br>  At first, they wanted to make the game non-uniform, consisting of levels of different stylistics, but during the development process it became clear that we would not have time to draw such a number of art, we stopped at the Aztecs and everything related to this topic. <br><br>  Unity was chosen as the game engine.  What was chosen specifically, it is difficult to say.  We can say that for the totality of the advantages that it has.  It also began to prototype.  The first prototypes were terrible, but after adjusting the physics, even without textures, it became clear that the work was being done in the right direction. <br><br>  Somewhere in the middle of the development process, an official Unity version was purchased for iPhone development and a developer account was registered with Apple.  It makes no sense to tell about the registration, on Habr√© this topic is already covered quite widely. <br><br>  The name was thought out completely by accident, but it seemed very successful: Temporibus. <br>  After some time, after a single style was chosen, the name changed to: Temporibus Azteca. <br><br>  <b>Exodus:</b> <br><br>  After a month of development, I filled the first version in the appstore, 8 days of waiting and finally the green light.  There are still a lot of improvements and improvements to be made, but I would like to hope that even in its current form, the product turned out to be interesting and exciting.  Will it really happen or not, time will tell ... <br><br>  For those interested, the game can be found at <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/temporibus-azteca/id419137369%3Fmt%3D8">this</a> link.  I want everyone to have the opportunity to try to play Temporibus Azteca, so the appstore game is available for download for free. <br><br>  <b>Screenshots:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/008/dd5/2f7/008dd52f7cdf1ba174537e54323b12b4.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8f2/43b/cbb/8f243bcbba32091a7fd21c23b00afa2b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Thanks for attention.</b> <br><br>  <b>Upd Transferred</b> to Apple blog, because  discovered that blog Yapiarusya hidden from free viewing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114152/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114152/</a></p>
