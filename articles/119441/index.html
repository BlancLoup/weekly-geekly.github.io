Musicians, record companies, writers - the vast majority of this audience against piracy, and some make all possible efforts to combat piracy, as a phenomenon.  Most of the disgruntled pirates believe that they deprive the author (or the copyright holder, which the author is not so) profit, and very significant.  There is another point of view, the adherents of which even release their own works, whether it be books or music, in ‚Äúfree floating‚Äù on the Net.  Sometimes it brings a very unexpected result. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  So, some of the musicians who posted their works on the Web and allowing them to download completely free of charge, then received a tangible profit, greater than that which they usually received from copy-works.  Other figures laid out the music to the network at all, and asked the users to pay for who can and cannot, but who can not.  As a result, the amounts received through this scheme exceeded the income of musicians from the sale of music at the usual price.

      Well, Adam Mansbach (Adam Mansbach), a writer, did surprise the world at all.  His book ‚ÄúGo the F ** k to Sleep‚Äù, which is intended for parents, became the most popular book in the Amazon top even before the launch of the book‚Äôs sales, which will only happen on June 14.  It turns out that pirates made such a popular book. <br><br>  It all started with the fact that Adam unsubscribed to Facebook, brought to white heat with his own child, offering everyone to buy a children's book ‚ÄúGo The F ** k To Sleep‚Äù.  Friends, colleagues and friends of the author reacted so violently that he really had to write this book.  According to those who read it, the book is quite interesting, and may be useful to parents.  But now everyone who read it used a free PDF-copy of the book, which was distributed on the Web by pirates, even before the paper version was released for sale. <br><br>  As a result, the book became the most popular in the top of Amazon, while its promotion was not spent, according to the publisher, not a cent.  Of course, now it is difficult to judge how many people will actually buy a paper copy, but most likely, the book will bring a considerable amount of money to both the publisher and the author. <br><br>  In addition, Adam Mansbach can be safely taken for the second book, because he has already become famous throughout the world, and on the wave of popularity can become recognizable for a long time, securing his success with another book. <br><br>  Here is such a pirate marketing turned out. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/may2011/tc20110516_746484.htm">businessweek</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119441/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119441/</a></p>
