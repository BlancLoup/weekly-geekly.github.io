  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Scoring, assessment of borrowers for the Webmoney system. Short review. Instruments</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The topic of making money on the Internet is quite popular and there are plenty of materials on this topic on various sites.  Despite this, various means of mining profits on the World Wide Web cause experienced and healthy skepticism among experienced users. <br><br>  There are many reasons for this, as well as the sites themselves promising considerable profits without much labor and time costs.  Various axle boxes, pyramids, HYIPs, referral systems, affiliate programs, active advertising systems, multi-level marketing, etc., make it possible in most cases to earn a penny, or to lose all the savings invested in them, because  places where they promise huge benefits - there is a huge risk of losing money.  Not surprisingly, a sophisticated user is looking for optimal ways to make money on the network from the position of ‚Äúrisk of loss - profit‚Äù or offers some of his own services that are interesting to other people, in fact, doing remote work or business. <br><br>  This article does not consider the ideal options, such as whether you have a visited site and making money from advertising on it (passive income), nor will we touch Forex - this is a topic for individual articles, of which there are enough.  Let's talk about Webmoney lending services and scoring for them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At the moment, Webmoney has two well-known tools for issuing or receiving units of the calculation of this system in debt.  - <a href="http://debt.wmtransfer.com/About.aspx">‚ÄúDebt service‚Äù (Dept)</a> and <a href="http://credit.webmoney.ru/About.aspx">‚ÄúCredit exchange‚Äù</a> .  Being identical in meaning, they represent two different in structure and principles of service operation.  The main technical differences between them are discussed below.  - Dept allows the wallet owner to trust a certain part of the amount (or the entire amount) on it for use by another member of the Webmoney system for a certain period, percentage and is an electronic equivalent of a loan between two persons, the credit exchange implies in many cases equity participation in the loan and work application with <a href="http://wiki.webmoney.ru/projects/webmoney/wiki/WMC">WMC wallets</a> , which is not in Dept-e.

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
      In fact, there are a lot of technical and ideological differences between the Debt Service and the Credit Exchange, and they all end up in the fact that Dept is considered a more risky way to lend than the Credit Exchange, but more mobile and faster.  However, with a skillful approach, you can earn with the help of any of the tools mentioned above.  And with a percentage of profits far in excess of the percentage of bank deposits, remembering constantly about the still high risks.  Never invest your last savings in such services! <br><br>  More recently, few people have heard of such a concept as ‚Äúscoring‚Äù or, more precisely, ‚Äúcredit scoring‚Äù, Wikipedia tells us, is ‚Äúa person‚Äôs credit rating system (credit risks) based on numerical statistical methods‚Äù.  Naturally, the concept came out of off-line banking and similar institutions and gradually became fixed in various electronic payment systems, which is understandable - convenient tools and data for processing information in digital form become more and more than paper ones. <br><br>  Scoring programs of different complexity are present in any credit machine, determining who should be given a loan at the moment, and who should not be based on various parameters depending on many factors.  But these programs are usually hidden from the eyes of users and act for them as some invisible intermediaries. <br><br>  Linking information about Webmoney debt services and special scoring programs in one, we wonder if there are scoring systems open for most users and allowing them to choose whom to check at the moment, and who do not and thus help in making the final decision on issuing a loan (loan).  Not long ago, such systems existed only within the framework of credit service sites, providing, under certain conditions, information about their borrowers and their credit history.  But it is worth noting that such data turns out to be, as a rule, closed and not free of charge, and it is quite justified - why should credit automata share for just so pretty valuable information? <br><br>  At the moment, it has become easier to find independent websites on the Internet that provide a service for checking potential borrowers of Webmoney with varying degrees of detail.  Consider three of them brief characteristics. <br><br><ol><li>  <a href="http://wm-scoring.biz/">wm-scoring.biz</a> - Service initial inspection of Webmoney borrowers.  Allows for the well-known <a href="http://wiki.webmoney.ru/projects/webmoney/wiki/WMID">WMID</a> to get the result in the form of recommendations and scoring points, as well as fairly detailed information about the main parameters of the borrower and how they affected the overall scoring.  It has a simple loan interest calculator, interacts with a credit machine based on these checks of borrowers.  According to the personal opinion of the author of the article, wm-scoring is more focused on Debt than on a credit exchange, it has various statistical tables including those containing data on the latest user requests for loans.  So far completely free. </li><li>  <a href="https://wmids.ru/">wmids.ru</a> - Service specializing in borrowers and applications from the Credit Exchange.  It has a large set of parameters for assessing applications for loans and convenient means of adjustment (adjustment) for lenders.  Using these funds, you yourself can customize and at any time change the site‚Äôs environment to choose from good, excellent and mediocre loan applications.  And this setting can be individualized for each individual user-lender.  At this time, the service is completely free, but it is soon planned to enter a paid subscription. </li><li>  <a href="http://wmid-info.ru/">wmid-info.ru</a> - The site specializes in searching and evaluating both the technical indicators of the borrower of the Webmoney system, and a large amount of data related to its profile indirectly - pseudonyms, contacts, sites linked to the certificate of the potential borrower, and secondary wmids.  At the moment, free, but pretty soon will be introduced paid subscription. </li></ol><br><br>  If you are new to Webmoney's loan (credit) systems or an already experienced lender, you may be able to use the tools described in making the right decision, since the human brain will remain the best scoring device for a long time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/173135/">https://habr.com/ru/post/173135/</a></p>
