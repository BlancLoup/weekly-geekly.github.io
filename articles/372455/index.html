Due to this, the process of creating the ‚ÄúNational Provider‚Äù is already close to its end.  Now documents are being prepared for the commissioning of a communication center, contracts are being signed to join the networks of backbone providers. <br><br>  In the spring of this year, Volkov for the first time presented the ‚ÄúAttack on SORM‚Äù project.  The goal is to create your own provider.  This provider will provide real communication services and conduct business.  After the creation of a telecommunications company, the authors of the project are going to wait for requests from the FSB to agree on a SORM plan and purchase the necessary equipment.  Why all this?  According to Volkov, now the FSB requires providers to buy the appropriate equipment at their own expense.  The cost of hardware for SORM is high, and the equipment is supplied by a narrow circle of special licensed firms (‚ÄúSpecial Technology‚Äù and ‚ÄúMFI Soft‚Äù).  The Internet Protection Society claims that by demanding the purchase of SORM equipment from providers at its own expense, the FSB violates the law ‚ÄúOn Operational Investigation Activities‚Äù.  And just with this violation Volkov is going to fight. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The creation of the provider required funds, and they <a href="http://www.leonidvolkov.ru/p/136/">were obtained</a> using crowdfunding.  In less than two days, more than 120 thousand rubles were collected - just as much as you need to spend on obtaining a license provider. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/579/f66/5dd/579f665dd16eae1491351b5d30f513b1.png"><br>  <i>Extract from the register of licenses in the field of communication with information about the new provider.</i>

      Previously, the Internet Protection Society tried to appeal to various providers, with a similar purpose - after the demand of the FSB to go to court.  ‚ÄúBut we have several times found ourselves in a situation where the provider happily agreed to participate in a class action law, and at the very last moment, when the signature had to be placed under the documents, refused,‚Äù <a href="http://www.leonidvolkov.ru/p/134/">writes</a> Volkov. <br><br>  As soon as the demand is received, representatives of the ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs Provider‚Äù will go to court, pointing to the illegality of such a demand.  Earlier, Leonid Volkov wrote that the Ministry of Finance recognizes the possibility of receiving compensation for SORM from the state (the scan of the letter is given below).  According to the creators of "People's Provider", the chances of success in court for this project are enormous. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dff/71a/5d7/dff71a5d7f181fc76ef48f42dfc7edaa.jpg" height="750"><br><br>  In the comments to Leonid's post, some users express doubts about the expediency of the project itself.  For example, a number of readers believe that the ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs Provider‚Äù may not receive any requirements from the FSB for installing SORM.  ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs not a node that is being surrendered, but a communications network, an interconnection agreement can be concluded with any operator, but it is possible not to conclude.  Nobody will require you to buy anything, you will have to sign a plan for RFID 538, which cannot be appealed in court - this is not even a contract, it does not formally impose obligations on you.  Formally, you have to agree on this plan within six months after obtaining a license, and when you implement it, it is up to you to be responsible within 3 years.  And if it does, it will be easier for you to be attracted for not providing services, and not for a plan, ‚Äù <a href="http://www.leonidvolkov.ru/p/147/">writes</a> one of the users. <br><br>  When asked what the company would do if the FSB required nothing, Volkov replied that if there was no SORM, the new provider would begin to provide commercial communication services.  In this case, another small provider will work in Russia, one of the thousands. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372455/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372455/</a></p>
