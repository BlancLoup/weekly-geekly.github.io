And I just want to draw your attention to a question that worries me a lot. <br><br>  Do not be nervous.  You have heard the word inflation, but this does not mean that I will talk about $ samizenethe.  Then what does education have to do with it?  - you ask.  With all!  The fact is that right before our eyes there is one terrible thing, past which it is impossible to pass indifferent and which we simply must notice. <br><br>  In the past century, yes, in the very same place where your youth remained, if you had a specialist degree, then it was not difficult to get a job.  At least in the western world.  In our you just sent to a specific place, whether you like it or not.  But the essence does not change.

      And all because of having a higher education before - it was cool.  But now getting a diploma has turned into an ordinary Mudat ritual that everyone must go through.  After all, otherwise, according to society, a person is not full? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  For fun </h2><br>  Imagine that you will be introduced to two ordinary adults, about forty years old, of approximately the same status, one of whom has no higher education.  If you can ask questions, find out which of them has a diploma.  Without asking directly, of course. <br><br>  It‚Äôs stupid to predict any result, but I have confidence that you will not be able to notice any difference.  Here, more than ever, a reference to the research of British scientists would be useful. <br><br><h2>  What we have? </h2><br><br>  The larger number <del>  lemming </del>  people are sent in the direction of getting higher, the general level of the whole educational apparatus becomes worse. <br><br>  Why?  Because British scientists have already proved that <a href="http://lurkmore.ru/95%2525">95% of the population are idiots</a> .  This is a joke, but there is some truth in it. <br><br>  Nowadays, the whole process of learning simply becomes a ritual.  It is made tedious and boring stage, which just need to endure.  Everybody has diplomas.  Do you understand?  Everyone has it.  He no longer gives any competitive advantage. <br><br>  All your friends, neighbors, colleagues and that secretary have a diploma.  Everyone has!  There is a natural process of <strong>inflation education</strong> . <br><br><h2>  Lemmings found a way out! </h2><br><br>  How?  They now just began to study longer.  More!  Longer!  Do you understand?  Graduate school, candidates of science and so on.  They will sit and study till 30 years.  And their children will be <a href="http://v673.com/society/save-your-child/">forced to learn</a> to forty. <br><br>  And this will continue until the process itself reaches the point of absurdity.  I take this opportunity to direct you to a <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/rus/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html">great video</a> about education problems from the <a href="http://www.ted.com/">TED</a> conference. <br><br>  What?  I did not hear!  Ah, you also plan to go to graduate school to gain experience? <br><br><h2>  Your opinion </h2><br><br>  I want to hear your opinion.  If you do not have an account on HabraHabre, you can send your thoughts to <a href="http://twitter.com/v673">twitter</a> or contact me in <a href="http://v673.com/feedback/">another way</a> . <br><br>  <strong>Question:</strong> Do you think there is a process of inflation of education?  What do you think about it? <br><br>  <a href="http://kraynov.com/">Max Krainov</a> : There is, of course, but from the point of view of an observer, not noticing that less knowledge is required to achieve old results. <br><br>  <b>Sergey Petrenko</b> (head of Yandex. Ukraine): It does not exist. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> Taking this opportunity, I want to openly recommend you my blog: <a href="http://v673.com/">v673.com</a> .
