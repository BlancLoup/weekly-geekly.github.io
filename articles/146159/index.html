  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Can the Microsoft Surface Tablet change mobile devices?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Microsoft <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/microsoft/microsoft-surface.html">introduced</a> Microsoft Surface two days ago.  Although this name is familiar to many of us, yet it belongs to a completely new product.  In a nutshell - Microsoft Surface is a tablet computer on Windows 8. But, in fact, it is much more.  Although Surface is unlikely to destroy the iPad, it may well reanimate Microsoft. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c6f/4a2/7a0/c6f4a27a0bd28ca70c1cc8abcacabc48.jpg"><br><br>  Surface is fully developed by Microsoft.  This is not a tablet from Dell or HP, running on the operating system from Microsoft.  The company clearly conceived it in order to demonstrate Windows 8 from the best side.  The tablet itself seems fantastic.  Compared to the iPad, it looks more utilitarian with its clear lines, I / O ports and air vents.  And at the same time, it looks more like a serious tablet than a toy. <a name="habracut"></a>

      And yet, iron is not so important.  Do you remember?  Just the specifications have become obsolete.  Microsoft today is wisely praising the capabilities and design of Surface, not limited to a simple listing of its technical characteristics.  From the stage again and again it sounded that this is a PC.  Of course, this is a tablet, but also this is a PC - an abbreviation associated with work, power and boring desktop software.  Microsoft definitely created this tablet, or rather a PC, in order to give Windows 8 a chance for success.  Or, in other words, Microsoft developed the tablet itself, because it does not trust its own partners who provide them with technical equipment. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAs soon as you take it in hand, you will understand how high-quality it is,‚Äù said Panos, the chief designer of Surface, at the presentation.  Never before did Microsoft create hardware for Windows.  Never.  But now, when the traditional PC market fades into the background and pulls Windows along, Microsoft has revised its standards and rushed to the front line with new forces.  I have not yet been able to personally hold Surface in my hands, although this is the first Windows device I‚Äôm so eager to get since the days of the Dell Adamo XPS. <br><br>  I adore my iPad.  I use it every day, and thanks to Logitech's ultra-thin keyboard, I work on it quite productively, although I still use only about 80% of its potential.  I like the tablet format.  I hesitated whether to change my iPad to a MacBook Air just because of apps created for touchscreen devices.  But I prefer to roam Reddit on my iPad, thanks to the Alien Blue app.  Flipboard gives me a ton of information that I would not get in any other way.  And culinary applications - my God, yes, I just adore them.  However, I cannot create and publish an article on TechCrunch using an iPad.  And on the Surface - I can. <br><br>  Laptops have dominated the mobile computing industry since its inception.  Tablets still have to prove that they are serious productive devices due to their limited computing platform.  But this is Windows.  With Office.  On the tablet.  With a stunning removable keyboard.  You can love them or hate them, but Windows and Office know how to get things done. <br><br>  First users praise Surface.  Technology lovers like the sensations of a cool product and the speed of the system.  Although there are still many white spots.  No Surface price reported.  How will the keyboard work?  What will happen to the tablet after 5 hours of continuous work?  This raises the question - how long is the battery?  Is there 3G / 4G in it?  Is it suitable for entrepreneurs?  And, most importantly, will developers want to create apps for Metro? <br><br>  The advantage of the iPad is that it has a large number of third-party applications hosted on the App Store.  Apple lured a crazy number of developers to its platform, promising them a profit and fair application distribution environment.  Microsoft needs to create an application distribution environment for Surface from scratch.  But the tablet works on Windows.  This is the most common operating system on Earth.  So at this initial stage, I would advise the developers, before it is too late, to join the success of Metro.  Even if Surface crashes, there will be dozens of tablets on Windows 8 from other manufacturers. <br><br>  Surface is not a serious competitor to the iPad; rather, it is interesting as a design reference or as a Microsoft image device.  Toward the end of this year, the first ARM models will be released, probably they will cost around $ 400- $ 600, and x86-models will be sold for about $ 1,000. Even despite the fact that Surface will probably never overtake the iPad, It sets clear standards for HP, Dell, Lenovo, Acer and Asus.  It shows the rest of the market what the correct tablets should be on Windows 8. As an image device, it is mainly designed to draw attention to Microsoft and Windows 8, just like Chevrolet launches Corvette. <br><br>  Microsoft has not released anything cool since the days of Windows XP.  Windows 7 just replaced Windows Vista.  The fate of mobile Windows depends on the Finnish company <a href="http://apps4all.ru/articles/devices/nokias-problem.html">in distress</a> .  Zune never liked anyone.  Bing is just a clone.  No one is using Hotmail.  I still do not understand the benefits of Windows Live.  The only successful project of the company is a gaming system, released 7 years ago.  Microsoft has been surviving for the past 10 years.  And just as Windows needs a killer device like Surface, Microsoft is desperate for a trust from its customers. <br><br>  Like most people, I just watch the outcome of the situation.  Although I am not an ignorant fan, blindly rejoicing in the victory of any random company, I don‚Äôt care which company wins in a mobile-computer war until consumers benefit from it.  In the past few years, Apple has created several outstanding devices.  And now, with Surface, Microsoft also has a first-class device worthy of praise. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146159/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146159/</a></p>
