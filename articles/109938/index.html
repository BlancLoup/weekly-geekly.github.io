      It should be noted that this phone is comfortable in the hand. <br>  The back panel is made of soft-touch plastic.  It feels like rubber. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e98/b27/12c/e98b2712c4a91cb0644794067bbbff21.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Screen </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/375/934/e9a/375934e9a04a8184019d60bb45830ea3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This phone has a 3.2 inch TFT display with excellent brightness.  I have it costs about 30%, everything is clear. <br><br><h5>  Buttons </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f40/19c/d9f/f4019cd9f591854994674ff37a403ce8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The buttons on this device are ordinary, not touch. <br><ul><li>  additional menu button (forgive me for having called her that way, I don‚Äôt know the true name) </li><li>  exit button to main menu </li><li>  back button </li><li>  search button. </li><li>  unlock button located on the top of the device </li><li>  volume rocker located on the right side of the device. </li></ul><br>  The rocker and unlock button are recessed and almost invisible. <br><br><h5>  Connectors </h5><br>  The phone has a micro-usb connector used for charging and interacting with a computer, and a 3.5 mm Mini Jack for connecting a headset. <br><br><h4>  Specifications </h4><br><br><h5>  Screen </h5><br>  As I already wrote, the phone has a 3.2 inch capacitive screen.  Its resolution is 320x480 pixels. <br><br><h5>  CPU </h5><br>  This unit has an ARMv6 architecture processor with a clock speed of 600 MHz.  Enough, but anrgy birds often freeze, especially when objects collide.  But the main problem is not this, but the fact that the processor is heavily loaded with <u>any</u> press! <br><br><h5>  operating system </h5><br>  LG P500 is running android 2.2.  Flash support is missing due to weak processor.  (must release 2.3. <a href="http://news.ferra.ru/hard/2010/12/11/106181/">Pruflink</a> <br>  You can put programs on the sd card, which is undoubtedly convenient, because  its memory on the phone ~ 170 megabytes. <br><br><h5>  Programs </h5><br>  Many pre-installed programs, such as, for example: Google maps, VKontakte, Odnoklassniki, Agent mail.ru, Poster, Facebook, Twitter, Google talk, etc.  All unnecessary can be demolished using the root. <br><br><h5>  Other </h5><br>  The phone works with wireless networks of 3.5G, Wi-Fi (can also act as an access point), Bluetooth. <br>  Also included in the design are an accelerometer, a 3.0 megapixel camera. <br>  The operating memory of the phone is 512MB <br><br><h4>  Using </h4><br>  The phone uses the interface from LG.  For me, it is quite convenient. <br>  So far I have nothing to compare with, there were no smartphones (there was a Samsung Wave 525, but you can't really call it a smart phone, it's terrible). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/790/424/d72/790424d727db892062c844fde3d6b48f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You can put Skype. <br><br><img src="http://i062.radikal.ru/1012/d0/2e246d9ca418.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It works perfectly on Wi-Fi networks, but I really didn't understand 3G.  If these networks are well spread in your city, then, most likely, you will be perfectly able to chat on Skype and in these networks. <br>  There is a voice search, but this is rather an plus android than this phone. <br>  There is a pre-installed fb reader program, which you probably already know from the droider chart. <br><br><img src="http://s004.radikal.ru/i205/1012/9f/0d595fcc6f36.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ThinkFree Office is among the preinstalled software.  As I understand it, this is a program for viewing MS Office files, without the possibility of editing.  In general, to list all the programs on this phone is stupid, because there are already a large number of them, and they are constantly updated in the Android Market. <br>  There are GPS and A-GPS.  Yesterday I tested it - found me for sure.  It is only necessary to allow the use of GPS in the phone settings. <br><br><h5>  Battery </h5><br>  He behaves quite decently.  Its capacity is 1500 mAh.  It is enough for a couple of days of normal load.  If you actively use, live only a day and a half.  In my opinion this is normal, because  Smartphone batteries don't last very long. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  In my opinion, this is quite a decent device, especially when you consider that it costs only <u>10,000</u> rubles! <br><br>  Summarizing the summary, I will note its pros and cons: <br><h5>  Pros: </h5><br><h6>  + Of course, the price </h6>  10 000 rubles for a phone with such characteristics - in my opinion, not bad. <br><h6>  + Android </h6>  Of course, this is a plus.  I will not say that this platform is the best, because  I hurt the Yabloko or anyone else.  But, undoubtedly, this OS is one of the best. <br><h6>  + A huge number of programs </h6>  Not all mobile operating systems can boast of this (well, or so far they can not) <br><h6>  + Quality of used parts </h6>  One soft-touch plastic is worth something!  Everything is collected carefully, no squeaks. <br><h6>  + Weight </h6>  This may seem strange to many, but for me this is a plus.  Because my previous Wave 525 was practically not felt in my pocket.  If I had lost or forgotten it somewhere, I would not even understand it.  This will not happen with the P500. <br><h5>  Minuses </h5><br><h6>  - 100% CPU load when pressed </h6>  This makes it hard to play.  But in Android 2.3, this should be <a href="http://android.mobile-review.com/news/1225/">corrected</a> . <br><h6>  - Fake (not real) multitouch </h6>  To some, this may seem a minus, but in my opinion it does not greatly affect the overall impression of the phone.  But still standard multitouch gestures are supported, which is quite enough.  And with a projection capacitive display, the phone would be more expensive, with similar functionality. <br><br>  Unfortunately, I like this phone very much, so I found little cons in it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109938/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109938/</a></p>
