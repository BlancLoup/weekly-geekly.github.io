In minimum time, you can now add to your application certain functions, structures, procedures provided by another application, operating system, or service.  The API of their services and applications are now being opened by many developers. <br><br>  In 2013, IBM opened three Watson cognitive systems APIs at once within the framework of The Watson Ecosystem, an ecosystem that at the time included more than 40 different technologies.  Thanks to these APIs, developers were able to integrate the capabilities offered by IBM Watson into their own applications and services.  Now open by the IBM API is much more than three, and the services themselves have become more functional.  In the sequel - a description of the existing API of various services that can be accessed by the developer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now they are divided into several groups in accordance with the basic capabilities and scope of use.
