      Our questions are answered by Alena Nikiforova, director of the St. Petersburg beauty salon <a href="http://salon-figaro.ru/">"Figaro"</a> .  Questions and answers turned out to be official - but nothing can be done, this is still an interview with a client. <br><br>  <i>Why did you decide to install an online recording system?</i> <br><br>  We have always tried to be on top in everything, including in dealing with customers.  For example, we have long been providing online advice on our website.  They also placed a ‚Äúvirtual salon‚Äù where any visitor can upload a photo and ‚Äútry on‚Äù different haircuts or hair color.  We noticed that site visitors are actively using these services.  This suggests that among our customers, more and more people are ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù - with the Internet and various updates to ‚Äúyou‚Äù.  Therefore, we thought and decided: we will introduce another new product to improve the quality of service - online recording. <br><br>  <i>What turned out to be the most difficult in the implementation process of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãSalons?</i> <br><br>  The most difficult thing was to overcome his laziness and inertia ( <i>and this is the truth of life - author's note</i> ), to prove the need for changes in the work of other key employees of the salon. <br><br>  Over the last couple of years, the number of salons in our area has increased and competition has significantly increased!  In this regard, there are serious fears of losing customers, to be lower level, to become less interesting for the consumer.  These concerns and force us to constantly expand and develop our services.  Of course, the salon could continue to work without these improvements, but then it would be impossible to stand out against other salons. <br><br>  <i>How big is the gap between modern IT technologies and the beauty salon industry?</i> <br><br>  There is no divide between the beauty salon industry and IT technologies!  If we talk about customers, then ordinary people go to beauty salons, and now everyone has phones, the Internet, other mobile devices.  All these IT technologies have long become commonplace and have become firmly established in everyday life.  Therefore, there can be no abyss about which you speak. <br><br>  If we talk about the equipment of the salons, then it already very much depends on the level of the salon itself.  If we talk about us, we have never been very far from IT technologies, we have always tried to keep up with them.  Besides, I have a young son and, of course, he is aware of all these modern technologies, he himself has a whole bunch of different electronic devices.  By the way, he told me that it would be very cool if we implement an online recording system and give each master a mobile tablet.  Now we have a touchscreen monitor next to each working chair, on the screen of which the master sees his schedule, new entries, can see the history of visits of his client, etc. <br><br>  <i>What do visitors say about the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãSalons?</i> <br><br>  There are people who have not tried our new recording system.  They still continue to record, running to us before or after work or calling.  Here the habit or desire for personal contact is more often triggered.  But more and more there are those visitors who, having once tried to sign up through the ‚ÄúSea of ‚Äã‚ÄãSalons‚Äù system, now use only it.  The number of such people is constantly increasing.  For us, this serves as a good confirmation that we don‚Äôt waste our energy on the development of our new recording system.  We are very pleased when our customers compare us with other salons and this comparison is in our favor.  We like that not every salon has such a recording form, thanks to which we are very different from other salons, and our customers appreciate it. <br><br>  <i>What results are visible now?</i> <br><br>  Noted for a few pluses. <br><br>  First of all, the biggest plus for me, as the owner of the salon, is the opportunity not to go to the salon personally once again, but simply to log in and see: who is working today, how busy we are, whether there are new customers in the record, view statistics and etc.  This is very conducive to more productive work and reduces travel time. <br><br>  Secondly, administrators are less distracted by the phone and pay more attention to visitors, which is very pleasing.  Previously, our administrators had virtually no opportunity to move away from the phone.  In addition, it is impossible to retell the whole ‚Äúmatrix‚Äù of free time on the phone, it turns out that we are playing with a client as if in a sea battle.  This is inconvenient to him or us. <br><br>  Thirdly, we noticed that those visitors who record online order a little more services than when they were recorded in person or by telephone.  Perhaps people feel more liberated.  Calmly exploring services, without haste, they choose a time to visit and immediately book it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137111/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137111/</a></p>
