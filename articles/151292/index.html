  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Easy way to fail testing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Sometimes testing does not bring the desired result.  That is, the work is boiling, features are checked, bugs are repaired, even some statistics are collected, but after the release it turns out that the product is stuffed with defects, like sunflower seeds, - and users, characteristically, spit. <br>  Who is guilty?  Of course, everyone is guilty - both managers, programmers, and analysts, but let them learn their own lessons. <br>  Well, testers. <br>  Also. <br>  To blame. <br>  Yes? <br>  Yes.  And the point is often not technical problems, but quite human ones.  No, it happens, of course, that the uprising of machines breaks all the plans, or that the plans were initially unfeasible.  But even in a non-force majeure situation, the tester has enough ways to fail testing by working hard. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  That's not mine </h4><br>  This is developed in the Samara office, let them deal with their defects themselves.  Not eyeless after all. <br>  This is what Kolya was given to test, which I will climb.  Let him study. <br>  Three more iterations back gave this feature.  Probably that is how it should work. <br><br>  Such an approach is not necessarily due to indifference.  Maybe a person is sincerely sure that the Samara office will successfully find and fix everything;  and Kohl - and so nervous when he advised something.  Yes, and their tasks so much that freshly made coffee remains unabsorbed.  Not so in general.  Although it was enough just to ask ‚Äúhey, why is it like this?‚Äù In Samara or Kolya. <br><br><h4>  The developer said it was intended </h4><br>  And I believed it. <br>  And I did not think that could be otherwise. <br>  And we have no analysts;  as the programmer said, so it‚Äôs right. <br>  And the analyst is on vacation. <br>  I even wanted to double-check, but I forgot - so many tasks ...

      Here, of course, as with a dinosaur, - either a meeting or not.  In the sense - either the developer rights, or not.  Again, you can run into both stupidity / naivety, and from sincere respect, if the authority of this particular developer is high.  The only working option - check without looking at the person.  Everyone is mistaken. <br><br><h4>  It did not work, but suddenly it worked - apparently everything is in order. </h4><br>  I just asked the developer, he did something, and he works. <br>  I just changed those fifteen parameters at random. <br>  For old objects, however, it does not work, but for new ones everything is in order. <br>  Oh, and I, on the contrary, with the new something strange.  But the old is OK! <br>  Yes, just drank tea, and everything was fine.  Who knows what was there. <br><br>  Are you a tester or someone?  Leaving the problem, not fully understanding what's the matter, not understanding the programmer's explanation, well, why are you so? <br><br><h4>  For developers, the problem does not repeat </h4><br>  He has a newer library there - he will get into the next build.  All is well, in short. <br>  Apparently I have something wrong with the settings, well, those fifteen that I changed - remember? <br>  Yes, we have iron is just frail, that's all. <br>  Well, I saw it myself, it works for them! <br><br>  Damn it! <br><br><h4>  Oh well, still such nonsense to report </h4><br>  We already have a lot of bugs. <br>  And such a trifle, no one will notice. <br>  Yes, and get to this screen, two of the hundreds. <br>  Point, comma - what's the difference? <br>  By the way, the bus is about to leave. <br><br>  There can be anything.  If this kind of defects and so on - half a bugtracker, and everyone is stuck in a state of "sometime not now" - yes, you can not start it.  And so I would be reinsured.  Well, at least I would ask who, yes? <br><br><h4>  Why would he not work on another database engine, another OS? </h4><br>  SQL it is SQL, what's the difference? <br>  So what if that one is 64-bit? <br>  Well, here's another update to type on the machine ... <br>  Checked already works. <br><br>  Get out of the profession. <br><br><h4>  It was not clear, but the developer explained </h4><br>  Here in the interface they asked something, did not understand what it was about.  But Cyril explained how.  It turned out to be easy. <br><br>  Well, yes, and that before explaining for three hours I could not figure it out - this is a trifle.  We will not add tips to the product or explain in the documentation.  Why, if you now understand everything? <br><br><h4>  Feature?  I checked, the button works, everything is fine </h4><br>  Usage scenario?  No, have not heard. <br><br>  And so - the work is in full swing, all in business. <br>  All is well, in general. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151292/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151292/</a></p>
