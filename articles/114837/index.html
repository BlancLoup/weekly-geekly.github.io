  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Apple iPad2 preview preview</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I'll be brief: yesterday, Apple introduced the second version of its iconic tablet, the iPad 2. I was fortunate to not only watch the live video broadcast of the event, sitting in the London BBC Television Center, but also to touch the novelty with my own hands.  So I just can't share my impressions. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/TCWRnr51sbk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgNzEyifHiaEm4ux-YMQQ2ycCoiLg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Presentation </h4><br>  At this time, before the start of the presentation, there were two subjects for discussion on the forums and on social networks.  First, the tablet itself, its appearance and specifications.  And secondly, people were guessing who would still come on the scene and present a novelty.  Since Steve Jobs once again had trouble with his health, they even thought that Apple was actively looking for Jobs‚Äôs successor.  Fortunately, Steve surprised everyone here - he went on stage himself, looked very good and had a great presentation.  Someone may reproach me with unnecessary work, but I will answer in advance: Apple‚Äôs CEO and what his company does can be treated differently, but the fact remains: the uncle is really a genius, and our world is very small.

      <br>
    <h4>  Design </h4><br>  Now let's go directly to the tablet.  Compared to the first iPad, there are quite a few changes in it - both inside and outside.  The first thing that catches your eye is the thickness of the device.  It is only 8.8 mm, which is 33% less than the tablet of the first generation and even less than the thickness of the iPhone 4 (9.3 mm).  The trend towards sharpening continued, and therefore the iPad 2 looked like a much enlarged iPod touch 4G.  Fortunately, unlike the ‚Äútacha‚Äù, the edges of the tablet do not stick into the palm of your hand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5cb/b04/3ac/5cbb043ac65aab93ff37e989326185ec.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Unfortunately, I did not have the first iPad or iPhone 4 on hand, so I had to put HTC Desire near it for clarity.</i>  <i>The difference is really impressive!</i> <br><br>  Of course, such changes could not but affect the weight of the device.  Now it is almost identical in both Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi + 3G versions of the tablet: 601 and 613 grams, respectively.  Previously, these numbers were more: 680 and 730 grams. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f5f/bf6/df7/f5fbf6df71c7373f2b087c10711d11af.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition, the tablet will now be released in two colors - black and white, with both variations available for sale simultaneously.  White iPad 2 looks very unusual.  One of my colleagues even said that he gave Chinese, but I cannot agree with that.  Apparently, you just need to get used to it - not so many white devices recently released Apple. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/44c/5c3/42e/44c5c342ea13a95552321ac0f57fb1b7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A front-facing FaceTime video camera camera appeared on the front side.  With iPad 2 you can communicate with users of any other Apple devices also equipped with a front camera: iPhone 4, iPod touch 4G, MacBook and iMac.  Resolution - 640 x 480 (VGA), recording speed - 30 frames per second. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/54b/89d/174/54b89d174f21be0b23909622f50314eb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But if the appearance of the camera for video calls was quite expected, not everyone was waiting for the main camera on the back panel.  Incidentally, I was one of them who thought that Apple would save it for the iPad 3. It‚Äôs hard to say whether it is the same as in iPod touch 4G or not without watching the video on a computer, but it‚Äôs known that it will be recorded with similar performance: in 720p format at 30 frames per second. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f5/084/40d/2f508440d4cea7c919d9edc499c16211.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the lower part of the back side a neat lattice appeared, under which the speaker was hidden.  Many people scold her very much - they say it is brutal, clumsy, but for my taste, there is nothing terrible in it. <br><br><h4>  Display </h4><br>  Discussing the upcoming new display in advance, many for some reason expected that the display in iPad 2 would be made using Retina technology.  But miracles do not happen, because to achieve such a density of points on a 9.7-inch display is quite difficult and it‚Äôs impossible to do with a single processor.  So the screen is the same: the resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels at a density of 132 dpi, the IPS matrix. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ec/810/911/3ec810911e90ee39922c1b763e642d89.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Filling </h4><br>  Now about the most interesting, about internal changes.  The first is, of course, the new processor, which received the expected name of the Apple A5.  It is dual-core and operates at 1 GHz.  According to Jobs, this ‚Äúmiracle stone‚Äù increased the performance of the graphics subsystem by as much as 9 times and allowed the tablet to have a battery life of 10 hours in normal mode and a month in standby mode. <br><br>  With RAM, the situation is incomprehensible.  There are suspicions that it nevertheless increased, but there is no official confirmation of this.  No comments, and that's it.  So we wait until the craftsmen do not receive information through the autopsy.  But this is unlikely to occur before the date of commencement of sales.  In addition, the new iPad has a three-position gyroscope.  Exactly the same as in iPod touch 4G, so now the tablet does not tupit at all and quickly turns the display when the gadget changes position in space. <br><br>  Another nice feature is the appearance of an optional adapter from the standard Apple dock connector to HDMI.  So now both generations of tablets iPad, iPhone 4 and iPod touch 4G can be connected to external displays to play content. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/714/a51/822/714a518221b4191accacd0fc320474e3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Moreover, the connector is tricky: you can not only connect iPad 2 via HDMI to the TV, but also continue to feed it with energy.</i>  <i>In the US, this little joy will cost $ 39.</i> <br><br><h4>  Soft </h4><br>  The expectations about the new version of the Apple iOS operating system came true.  True, the number she received was not the fifth, but 4.3, which, in general, does not change much.  So, about innovations in order: <br><ul><li>  Safari browser will now work even faster thanks to the appearance of the Nitro JavaScript module. </li><li>  Now it is not necessary to copy audio and video files to watch them on your tablet, phone or Apple's top player.  Listen to music and watch movies on devices running iOS 4.3, you can simply connect to the main computer via Wi-Fi. </li><li>  Improved streaming audio, video and photo content on Apple TV - AirPlay.  The main innovation - support for third-party applications for data transfer. </li><li>  Well, the most pleasant, in my opinion, function is the ability to turn the iPhone 4 into a hotspot for other iGadgets. </li></ul><br>  Free upgrade iOS to version 4.3 will not be next week - March 11th.  But only owners of iPad, iPad 2, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, and also iPod touch 3G and 4G can do it. <br><br>  Well, if we talk directly about the new applications, specially optimized for the new iPad, now you can install PhotoBooth (thanks to the front camera), iMovie (thanks to the main camera) and GarageBand (thanks to ... well, obviously Steve Jobs).  I don‚Äôt know how about iMovie, but with GarageBand like children after the presentation, so many journalists played.  I didn‚Äôt become an exception either, even though I don‚Äôt understand anything in music making. <br><br><h4>  Prices </h4><br>  Sales of iPad 2 in the US will begin on March 11, so it's time to buy tickets to the other side of the Atlantic.  There is an opinion that if you bring a bag of gray iPads to Russia on the day of launch, then you can <s>fly into the customs well</s> then not work for a year.  In the States, the price tag for new tablets will look like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f9/7b4/441/2f97b44417b71bbe12fdcc633be4b33d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And on March 25, sales of iPad 2 will begin in 26 countries, mostly European.  But Russia, as always, did not make the list. <br><br><h4>  Nanowat </h4><br>  Together with the new tablet, a new accessory has appeared - Smart Cover.  A very vivid example of the fact that all genius is amazingly simple.  The four-cover magnet cover is attached directly to the iPad 2. If you close the screen of the tablet, it will immediately go into sleep mode, if you fold one of the sections or the entire cover, the tablet will wake up.  By changing the position of the Smart Cover segments, you can position the iPad 2 exactly as it will be convenient. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/278/a1e/68f/278a1e68f44eb1a0bf50c5596335f2d3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>For example, so.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/78c/48c/f13/78c48cf13a41edec76958b3dd30dd913.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Or like this.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/82b/41f/80f/82b41f80fc6ffe32158bedb2b8964e0f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ba/643/c37/9ba643c3775b2628de267d57e0a53fc1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/169/193/57e/16919357e623e130d65d911665375faf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Both the polyurethane and leather version of the accessory will be on sale: for $ 39 and $ 69, respectively.  There will be 5 mats of each type in different colors. <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  Frankly speaking, when I first took the iPad 2 into the hands of no divine grace, the chakras did not open, and uncontrollable salivation did not happen.  In short, no special enthusiasm.  I just felt that I was keeping a good, high-quality, lovingly and, most importantly, wisely made thing.  Apple, as always, is in its repertoire: no sharp and ill-conceived releases, smoothly and measuredly top products are updated, getting better and better.  So with iPad 2 it happened. <br><br>  It's good that the case material did not become the same as in iPod touch.  The chances were small, but there were still concerns.  It is pleasant to hold matte aluminum in hands, the tablet does not slide.  But it is a pity that with such a serious decrease in thickness there was no radical decrease in weight.  I suspect that lying in bed watching movies on the iPad will still not be very comfortable - your hands will get tired anyway. <br><br>  But pleased with the appearance of versions of GarageBand and iMovie, optimized for Apple tablets.  Although not so wide, this is still a step towards the professional use of the iPad. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt know if the statistics is true, which claims that Apple owns 93% of the market for all tablets in the world.  But I can say for sure that the iPad 2 will very seriously strengthen its already strong position in this segment.  And it will certainly set a new trend for dual-core processors in tablet computers. <br><br><h4>  TTX </h4><br>  <b>OS:</b> iOS 4.3 <br>  Processor: Apple A5, 1 GHz <br>  <b>Memory:</b> 16-64 GB <br>  <b>RAM:</b> 512 MB <br>  <b>Display:</b> 9.7 ", 1024 x 768, IPS <br>  <b>Video:</b> you can display Full HD on the big screen <br>  <b>Wireless communication:</b> UMTS / HSDPA / HSUPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz);  GSM / EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz), Wi-Fi 802.11b / g / n, Bluetooth <br>  <b>Connectors:</b> Apple USB, 3.5 mm, HDMI via adapter <br>  <b>Camera:</b> video recording in 720p format at 30 k / s + camera for calls on Face Time <br>  <b>Work time:</b> 10 hours, up to a month in standby mode <br>  <b>Dimensions:</b> 241.1 x 185.7 x 8.8 mm <br>  <b>Weight:</b> 601 g </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114837/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114837/</a></p>
