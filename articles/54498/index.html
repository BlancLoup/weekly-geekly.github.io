    <a name="habracut"></a>  I came out of this paradoxical situation in a relatively noble way, that is, I chose a good Habratopic in the sandbox and invited the author to Habr.  Now, if this author survives on Habrahabr during the week and accumulates a lot of good karma, only then in a week he will be able to vote for someone else‚Äôs karma, and then, perhaps, he will be grateful, having increased karma to me in return.  Or maybe not show, forget.  I myself will not remind him of this, such a reminder would be an indelicate doubt in human gratitude.  Moreover, the transition from, say, <nobr>‚Äú-2‚Äù</nobr> <nobr>to ‚Äú-1‚Äù</nobr> does not help much the cause: this week I could either hope to collect the missing karma on my own, or this modest unit would not help me seriously. <br><br>  But inevitably, one has to come to the grim conclusion: it turns out that such paradoxes provoke in general everyone from the number of minted Habrowans to puppets, to create new pseudonyms with transferring to them an invite and with further work from a fresh pseudonym, that is, starting from zero karma not out of the red  Although I myself did not succumb to such provocation, but I soberly acknowledge and urge all of you to be aware: much less noble characters can happen. <br><br>  Such a situation looks bad, that is, it would be better not to provoke anyone in such a low-lying act. <br><br>  But what is needed in order not to provoke the minted Habrovites into puppelling in the paradox situation described above with an invitation (invite)?  It seems that for this purpose it is enough to make invitations available not only for sending to outsiders, but also to reset one‚Äôs own karma when it has become negative.  Or maybe even not just for nulling, but to bring to some positive meaning, so that at least the opportunity to use <nobr>HTML tags</nobr> in comments, which the newly registered habrovtsy do not possess, immediately appeared.  Then registering a pseudonym from scratch becomes completely unprofitable. <br><br>  A more global question: what is needed then in order not to provoke the minted Habrovites to any kind of puppelling that is done by registering a new pseudonym through the sandbox?  It seems that for this purpose it is enough to make the sandbox (or, even better, make some other special blog) accessible for publishing Habratopic minted Habrowers, and for earning karma there.  (Previously, the ‚ÄúI Am Smart‚Äù blog was set up for this purpose, but now we see a gaping void in the place of the habraecological niche that he rightfully occupied. Self-rehabilitation through the creation of Habratopic became completely impossible, the place of hope was firmly occupied by hopelessness.) <br><br>  Or maybe it would also be necessary to somehow exclude such situations when people put a <nobr>rating of ‚Äú+60‚Äù for</nobr> Habratopiku <nobr>,</nobr> at the same time without seeing and having no idea that the author of Habratopik is rapidly losing karma and even goes into a minus so much that need to "save" him.  After all, of course, if habrakhabrovtsy powerfully plus some habratopic, then it is reasonable to assume that at least some of the plus would like to continue to see habratopics that they like exactly the same author (which is impossible if the author goes to minus karma).  Now it‚Äôs not such a reasonable solution: now readers, when they thankfully vote for habratopic, they give the author of the programmed habratopek much sooner and more accurately only the opportunity to invite <nobr>some</nobr> other anonymous author from the sandbox instead of the author himself. <br><br>  In order to straighten out this state of affairs and give the habrasoobshchestvo in the hands of a universal tool that allows reading any worthy habratopeque to actively and productively express the emerging thought of ‚Äúauthor, write more!‚Äù, It is necessary to simplify one of the following possible solutions: <br><br>  1) Arrange some automatic dependence of the karma of the author on the rating of the author‚Äôs habratopic. <br><br>  2) Arrange a direct manual dependence of the author‚Äôs karma on his habratopic, that is, to allow readers of every habratope not only to vote for the habratopeque rating, but also (right there) to vote for the author‚Äôs karma. <br><br>  3) Allow the readers of any habratopic even to just see the value of the karma of the author of habratopic, and then let them understand themselves. <br><br>  (This list is incomplete; perhaps, you, readers, think of a few more or two possible solutions. Of the three decisions that I have invented and listed, I don‚Äôt really like the first one: is it appropriate to make the machine make decisions instead of <nobr>people-readers?)</nobr> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/54498/">https://habr.com/ru/post/54498/</a></p>
