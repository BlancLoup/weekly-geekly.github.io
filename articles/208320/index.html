  <section class="page js-page"><h1>To work with a clear conscience</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A person spends at work almost a quarter of his time each week.  If we exclude sleep and travel time from the working period, it turns out that work absorbs more than half of the time.  Having reasoned this way, I realized that I needed to look for a job in soul and money so that this time would not be a simple ‚Äúsitting out‚Äù in a comfortable or not so easy chair.  I was a graduate of the then prestigious Faculty of Finance and it seemed that a wonderful life - here it is, in the crusts of red diploma.  However, it was 2005 and the financiers were completely unnecessary.  At that moment, following disappointment, experience began to come. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/161/3be/0a1/1613be0a1e62c4ff000ab70fcd311b35.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Having changed several places of work and having received several additional formations, I found a middle ground for myself.  About the types of work and their benefits, I decided to tell habrayuzer.  I think it will be especially interesting for those who are just beginning their career or torn on it.  Of course, for programmers, the alignment looks different, but for other specialties, experience, I believe, is not useless. <br><br><h4>  You're lucky you're not like everyone else </h4><br>  The most common work is <b>work in the office</b> , from call to call, with colleagues and processing, with buns and LCA, with dull and cheerful corporate, with standard and not so much tasks. <br>  Of course, it is full of advantages: <ul><li>  guaranteed income </li><li>  Career growth at the end of the tunnel </li><li>  communication with employees and exchange of experience </li><li>  availability of any resources to perform tasks </li><li>  mastering the whole adjacent environment of their task </li><li>  social guarantees </li></ul><br>  Such work is convenient, legitimate, allows you to reveal all the talents of a specialist and ... does not exist.  Career growth is suppressed by ‚Äúours and ours‚Äù, tasks sometimes are striking in their inadequacy, communication with employees resembles a war or kindergarten (as lucky), resources are often limited to from 250 MB of Internet per week to calls to other branches and contractors across Russia score. <br><br>  Office work is almost inevitable, especially not in Moscow (actually, this is not about Moscow).  How comfortable it is to work in an office depends on how the employee initially sets himself up and how prepared he is for the challenges of office life.  If you initially prove yourself to be a professional, demand a relatively clear statement of tasks, skillfully organize others to solve common tasks, then you can survive, well, or quit, if you do not get any return.

    <h4>  Free flight bird </h4><br>  <b>Freelance</b> - another tempting test.  Naturally, I did not pass by: copywriting, translations from the French language, editing technical texts, reportage work at serious exhibitions and conferences - all these tasks were within our reach.  And if for reports and translation they paid regularly and even a lot, then copywriting, the most frequent type of orders, showed interesting statistics: out of every 10 orders, 8 turned out to be unpaid.  This state of affairs did not suit - time was wasted, the strength was gone, and the result was negative.  Naturally, contracts were concluded even less often, from which all problems grew. <br><br>  Of course, I am familiar with professional freelancers - they stamp template texts, make cheap websites, even write custom programs.  But their life is not for me: risk, nervous work at night, no less nervous clicking on 5-10 fixed tabs of freelancing sites.  In my opinion, as the main field of activity, this is a very hard, nervous, exhausting side effect (lack of orders, non-payment, completion without money) work. <br><br>  After 20-30 orders executed on the basis of freelancing, I can say for sure: <ul><li>  It‚Äôs very dangerous to work without a contract, but most of the customers at the first word about the contract disappear and go to the others.  Although, to pay tribute, the three most expensive orders were completed without a contract. </li><li>  Freelancing is not a liking for the soul; it is a constant, furious search for the next order. </li><li>  it is impossible to tune out your biological clock even to the most disciplined freelancer - the deadline does not allow to fall asleep, deadlines force you to work for days, forgetting about weekends and cooling tea </li></ul><br><h4>  Home, sweet home </h4><br>  <b>Permanent work is done under the contract</b> (labor or contract) <b>right from home</b> , do not move away from your favorite laptop and chair, right in your home suit and near the refrigerator.  This is probably the best option for someone, but for me it turned out to be the most terrible: the first blow was struck by relatives, who always need something, but difficult to refuse, the second blow was struck by the refrigerator - my workplace was a meter away from him, which was fast began to affect the appearance and health. <br><br>  Despite the surroundings, the work at home was in dispute, I calmly used all my books, knowledge, the Internet, made excellent texts and translations, and prepared marketing strategies that were already implemented by office marketers. <br>  But it was these strategies that forced me to leave this job: <br><ul><li>  working at home, you are cut off from the company, you cannot fully implement the project </li><li>  you get almost no experience giving your </li><li>  home distracts absolutely everything.  If you cannot firmly say: ‚ÄúI am not at home for this time,‚Äù then after three weeks of work, you can become a jerky, abnormal person. </li><li>  You practically live at home, stretching your work day due to distracting relatives. </li></ul><br><h4>  Exit found </h4><br>  Two years ago I got a job in a commercial service of a well-known IT company, where I perform several types of tasks, among which the main one is the analysis of business processes of organizations prior to the introduction of software, the development of TK and related tasks.  The work is interesting, responsible, diverse due to the diversity of customers.  However, over the past two years, schemes and methods have been developed, the management has changed, the team has changed imperceptibly - the work has become boring, the direction for the development of professionalism has become less, new colleagues are only interested in personal income. <br><br>  By the will of the magical case, a <b>part-time job</b> appeared in a small IT company.  This work turned out to be the very outlet, which was not enough for a professional tone: interesting, necessary, despite the remaining flaw - the inability to lead your project to the end, to see it from the inside. <br>  She gave impetus to my professional development: <br><ul><li>  This is experience in two adjacent specialties at once. </li><li>  I master new software types and new work tools (for example, Yandex and Google APIs, HTML layout, testing basics - now it is an urgent need) </li><li>  I calmly organize my working time on the basis of existing tasks </li><li>  such necessary organization and discipline taught me to count time and rely on strength, suddenly I began to take up studies and personal affairs </li><li>  3-4 hours a day for additional tasks it became easier to allocate than 8 hours for work in home mode </li><li>  switching between tasks gives an incredible synergistic effect. </li></ul><br><h4>  Conclusions costing 8 years </h4><br>  In addition to the development of professional skills, I received an invaluable experience of communication, several related specialties, made conclusions that 10 years ago could change my destiny. <br><br>  <u>Conclusion number 1.</u> <i><b>We need to work at the institute.</b></i>  The first thing I regretted is an empty work book.  While I was fighting for a red diploma and taught a materiel, my classmates got new records and new experiences.  They were not frightened by work in business, they knew what a team is, they learned to perceive work as a whole, assessing it not in isolation from the realities of the market and the company's position on it. <br><br>  <u>Conclusion number 2.</u> <i><b>You need to be able to rebuild.</b></i>  Economists in our city were not needed, the financiers were threatened only by work in the credit department of the bank.  I began to look for work in related industries - and so I got into marketing and selling a huge IT company.  The IT sphere itself fell in love with itself, and the practice of marketing and sales was sharply different from what the elderly grandfather was reading from softened textbooks.  I had to read a lot, study the history of previous projects, but all the efforts made in the end yielded results. <br><br>  <u>Conclusion number 3.</u> <i><b>Learn, learn and study again.</b></i>  For three years I only worked - for me it was learning, entertainment and work.  Then came the understanding that I do not know English (my first was French), that I, working in an IT company, speak different languages ‚Äã‚Äãwith techies and do not know the real depth of my product.  And I went to study first on a software developer, then on a system administrator.  It took 2.5 years.  I didn‚Äôt become a cool programmer, but I began to understand my product ‚Äúbefore the line of code‚Äù, the relationship with the developers became friendly.  And soon I left my second company, left sales and became a business analyst advising huge companies in choosing software, developing TK and so on ... <br><br>  What scheme of work to choose depends on the specialty and character of the person.  Probably, many of us will decide on the next, most dangerous and interesting, step - our business.  The main thing is not to allow work to become a tedious burden, because it is a huge part of the conscious life. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/208320/">https://habr.com/ru/post/208320/</a></p>
