  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Internet payments</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many in our country have heard for certain about payments through payment terminals, various payment systems, etc.  However, they still ask me where and how to pay utilities, credit, the Internet, etc.  They say it is inconvenient to stand with a lot of money from the terminal, you need to enter a lot of data.  So let's consider very convenient banking systems ... <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The first will consider Alfabank.  Why nominal him?  So historically, I will answer you, he first launched this service, and I was the first to connect this service in Alfabank.

      We go to any branch of Alfabank and conclude a contract for their OnLife service.  Be sure to specify a live mobile number, because  there will come sms with passwords.  It will take about 15 minutes. It will give you a plastic card and tie it to an account in Alfabank, the accounts will be in euros, dollars and rubles.  I used a ruble account.  In the office you will be given a login and password that you will need to change to your own when you first use it.  They will also issue a list of ATMs that accept cash to replenish the account. <br><br>  From the advantages of this system can be identified: <br>  1) instant replenishment of an account, after you put money in an ATM, there are no commissions for depositing and withdrawing money <br>  2) there is a virtual keyboard for entering a password, so the security is higher in my opinion <br>  3) you can transfer money from your account to Yandex money, the commission is only 2%, crediting is also instant.  Wash is not expensive enough and there is no need to look for these Yandex money cards.  Very convenient, used to transfer money, all operations can be done in a few minutes <br>  4) You can see the loan debt in Alfabank and repay it <br>  5) You can transfer money in euros, dollars and back <br>  6) You can get insurance <br>  7) You can buy pyths <br>  8) You can arrange a virtual plastic card <br><br>  The last 4 points for me personally were a rather dubious pleasure, but the functionality is still added. <br><br>  Now about the minuses: <br><br>  1) you cannot transfer payments to the budget, i.e.  pay taxes and fines, which for me was a significant limitation <br>  2) there is no field to specify the recipient's checkpoint <br>  3) transfer fee 0.3% of the payment amount, but not less than 20 rubles <br>  4) a monthly payment for just that actually 65 rubles, in my opinion, I am writing as a keepsake <br>  5) there is no possibility to print a payment order with a bank mark on the payment, you have to go there to the bank <br><br>  Let's go further, the second bank was Tatfondbank. <br><br>  The meaning and procedure of work is approximately the same, the functionality is approximately the same - loans, deposits, etc.  but do not come sms when transferring money with the account, and you at the conclusion of the contract is given a sheet with 30th !!!  session passwords that need to be entered at the request of the system.  The service is simply called - Remote banking services for individuals. <br><br>  Of the benefits <br>  1) you can pay taxes and penalties <br>  2) there is a field for specifying the recipient's checkpoint <br>  3) there is no monthly fee for banking services <br><br>  Of the minuses <br>  1) the commission for payment is higher than in Alfabank, namely, 1.5% but not less than 20 rubles <br>  2) there is no transfer to Yandex money <br>  3) there is no possibility to insure <br>  4) there is no possibility to buy currency <br>  5) not many ATMs accepting cash for account replenishment <br><br>  The third in a row was the Russian Standard Bank.  There are a lot of rumors and gossip in the country about this bank, interest on loans there is really hellish, but it provides banking services on more favorable terms than other banks.  The service is called Bank in your pocket. <br>  When making payments as well as in Alfabank, sms come to the mobile phone, so indicate it is real !!! <br><br>  Of the benefits: <br><br>  1) completely !!!  free cash management services <br>  2) the accrual of 10% per annum on the balance of money in the account <br>  3) the possibility of paying taxes and fines <br>  4) the possibility of repayment of loans taken in the Russian Standard, as well as tracking the status of credit and credit cards, <br>  5) wide cash ATM network <br>  6) you can print a payment order confirming the payment <br><br>  Of the minuses <br>  1) I would like a virtual keyboard when entering a password <br>  2) there is no binding to the Yandex Money wallet <br>  3) there is no possibility to buy currency <br>  4) there is no opportunity to buy insurance <br>  5) money deposited in an ATM is credited the next day !!!  Not much uncomfortable after Alfabank, but you can get used to <br><br>  All banks have the opportunity to transfer money to any third parties with a certain daily limit. <br>  Personally, I used to use Alfabank, now I‚Äôm switching to the Russian standard, while I‚Äôm satisfied, I hope this article will help the users to decide on the bank and pay for all services in a modern way with a minimum of time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79524/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79524/</a></p>
