Such an online store does not have a warehouse with goods, and after receiving an order from the buyer, the representative of the online store reserves the goods from the supplier and in the evening takes all the goods reserved for the day. <br><br>  This way of doing business allows you to have a fairly wide product range, while not investing huge money in the product.  According to this principle, most of the existing online stores work.  In this model there is one narrow link - the supplier, and more precisely the suppliers. <br><br>  If the online store places in its window only those products that are always in stock suppliers, then there is no problem, but often this applies only to the most popular items.  The rest of the suppliers' goods tend to run out, which means that online stores that place such goods on display windows incur losses, selling those goods that have ended. <br><br>  <i><b>What is wrong with suppliers?</b></i> <br><br>  In fact, everything is fine with suppliers, but they exist as if in a different world parallel to e-commerce.  This is, above all, the world of big money, large orders, kickbacks and a complete lack of values ‚Äã‚Äãinherent in the e-commerce market. <br><br>  Suppliers perfectly exist for themselves, but 1, 5, 10 online stores come to them and they want to ship goods one by one.  At the same time, online stores are asked to send information about the supplier‚Äôs inventory as often as possible, because the online store does not want to spend money on advertising goods that are not in the supplier‚Äôs warehouse. <br><br>  What do most suppliers do in this case?  That's right - they send online shopkeepers far away with their requests.  At best, online stores find suppliers who provide piece-by-piece shipment of goods subject to making a deposit to the supplier‚Äôs account.  In this case, the supplier sends each morning a document with a list of balances. <br><br>  It turns out that almost all online stores lose about 5% of orders due to the fact that they do not have accurate information about the stock balances in their suppliers' warehouses.  And finding suppliers who are ready to work with online stores is not an easy task. <br><br>  An additional challenge for online stores is reserving products that customers order.  With each purchase, you need to drop the order to the supplier manager with a request to reserve the goods so that it will not be shipped by someone else. <br>  This process takes a lot of time, since the supplier‚Äôs manager is much more important to order a large customer who buys a large consignment of goods, rather than shipping an online store. <br><br>  From the above, we can conclude that the supplier is fine, and the online stores have problems, but this is not entirely true.  Distribution companies have much more problems.  Sales in various markets no, no, yes, they subside, and significantly.  Plus, the competition is growing.  Here, many wholesalers are beginning to look at the e-commerce market, because there is an increase in tens of percent in almost all categories of goods sold through the Internet.  Most often, the supplier gets the idea to create his online store, and this is in most cases a strategic miscalculation.  Firstly, because wholesale companies usually do not make a calculation as such, that is, a business plan for creating an online store (I speak from the experience of communicating with dozens of suppliers). <br>  The approach is extremely superficial - there is a product, we will create a shop window, fill in money in advertising and start earning on the Internet. <br>  The result is dozens of closed Internet projects and hundreds of thousands of rubles spent. <br><br>  <i><b>How do we propose to operate a wholesale company now, and what gives our B2B portal?</b></i> <br><br>  First, in order for the product to be sold on the Internet, the supplier, in any case, needs to create high-quality product content.  That is, the image and description of the goods in electronic form. <br>  Secondly, you need to learn how to ship goods one by one. <br><br>  If the supplier has both, we suggest that he connect with his 1C account system to our portal.  We upload supplier stock balances to the portal and give the opportunity to customize the display of residuals on our portal in the form of real data or in the form of many / few.  The supplier sets wholesale prices for this product, and online stores that are registered on our portal have the opportunity to download the supplier‚Äôs product content and, making a premium, start distributing the product to the Internet without spending time creating product content. <br>  In addition, an online store can, through the portal‚Äôs functionality, place an order to a supplier, almost like in a regular online store.  If the supplier in his account system does not have this online store as a counterparty, then the order for the supplier will come to the email and to the supplier‚Äôs personal account on the portal.  After the supplier leads the counterparty of the corresponding online store, the online store can make reserves to the supplier through the portal literally on click, without distracting the supplier manager.  An order placed in this way will go directly to the supplier‚Äôs 1C. <br>  For online stores that use the <a href="http://www.insales.ru/">Insales</a> platform, it is possible to automatically update the balances on the storefront of the online store, depending on the balance of goods in the supplier‚Äôs warehouse.  The scheme looks like this: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/5gwx4CY021Q%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhj_iJ3ghM6jF9c1ZJ1t42oR_8XprQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Our B2B portal is a fairly effective tool for interaction between suppliers and online stores. <br>  In the near future, we plan to seriously develop the functionality of the portal in order to maximally automate the processes that today have to be done manually by both suppliers and online stores. <br>  The need for the emergence of such a tool is confirmed by demand - over a thousand online stores have already connected to the portal.  There are not as many suppliers as we would like, but we are still at the very beginning! <br><br> <a href="http://www.agorab2b.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8e9/d88/1a2/8e9d881a297f28d1b51fe27556a86c92.png" alt="image"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/199332/">https://habr.com/ru/post/199332/</a></p>
