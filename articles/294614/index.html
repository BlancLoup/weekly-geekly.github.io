  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Walter Isaacson's review of Steve Jobs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The other day, another long-awaited presentation by Apple was held.  And how can you not remember the legendary founder of the company?  Biography, written from the words of Steve Jobs.  It really can be read in any direction. <br><br>  This is my second review on megamind.  The first was a <a href="http://inostudio.com/ru/article/deadline.html">review of the book by Tom DeMarco ‚ÄúDeadline.</a>  <a href="http://inostudio.com/ru/article/deadline.html">A novel about project management</a> . <br><br>  On the one hand, this is a design history  on the other hand, a marketing textbook;  on the third - leadership cases and so on.  With all the versatility, the book, whatever it may be, does not fit into the series ‚ÄúZHZL‚Äù.  Isaacson sought to convey the diversity of Jobs figure.  In addition, the author‚Äôs relatives didn‚Äôt beat the author.  Therefore, the biography of the creator of Apple consists of contradictory moments a little more than completely.

      Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, who adapted the book for the movie screen, previously embodied the image of another modern revolutionary - Mark Zuckerberg.  If you look closely, the movie "Social Network" is a series of stories told on behalf of different people.  Each of the actors interpreted the image of the creator of Facebook in their own way.  In this regard, the book "Steve Jobs" goes even further.  Isaacson not only conducted more than forty interviews with the bearer of the biography himself, but also interviewed about a hundred of his friends and colleagues. <br>  According to the author and his respondents, the Jobs personality phenomenon was made up of several components: native land (silicone valley), adoptive father (a great negotiator and a passionate lover of cars) and hobbies (Bob Dylan, calligraphy, drugs and Zen Buddhism).  The reader will be surprised how easily Isaacson knocks bronze from this icon.  The legendary entrepreneur in life was a despotic hysterical, a rare rogue and irresponsible parent. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  One wonders asking the question: what is the main merit of Jobs?  First, as the protagonists of the TV series ‚ÄúSocial Network‚Äù correctly noted: the founder of Apple was able to give an idea.  In the late 70s, a computer was a toy for geeks, and no one except Jobs suspected it of a device for millions.  Secondly, Jobs had a unique sense of talent and technology.  The ability to recognize genius, make people believe that the impossible is possible.  And this is the main thing that distinguishes Jobs from a host of skeptics. <br><br>  Why and to whom to read? <br>  It is necessary to read at least three categories of people: those who are interested in the history of the latest scientific and technological revolution;  those who cannot understand the phenomenon of Apple's frantic success;  and, of course, to those who grieve over the death of their idol.  This is the case when the book will not leave anyone indifferent. <br><br>  Quote <br>  ‚ÄúPeople don't really know what they want until you show it to them.  That is why I never rely on market research.  Our task is to read what is not yet on the page. ‚Äù <br><cut></cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294614/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294614/</a></p>
