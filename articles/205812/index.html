  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Picaso 3D Designer Review - a new milestone in bulk printing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Picaso 3D Designer printer has a fairly solid development history; in fact, it was he who, albeit under a different name, was to become the debut project of Picaso 3D.  But everything turned out differently, and a model called Builder was the first to be released, and on the basis of the experience gained, Designer was brought to mind.  It is symbolic that the button that opened the ‚ÄúDesigner‚Äù edition came out of the womb of its predecessor: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img alt="image" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c2e/955/a7b/c2e955a7b8169da3497e8eca753905d3.jpg"></div><br><br><h2>  Appearance <br></h2><br>  Qualitative changes in the design are visible to the naked eye: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

    <div style="text-align:center;"><img alt="image" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/29e/abf/d83/29eabfd837da9d7a83fe026675ffbfab.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The Builder‚Äôs frame construction was replaced by a fully enclosed housing, behind which all the work items are hidden.  The material for the body served as a tandem of aluminum and plastic, and the latter has become somewhat better.  Color versions 5 and all of them look quite stylish, just what you need for a creative device: <br><br><img alt="image" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c7a/d1b/c1c/c7ad1bc1c1fc12ac01213c84e792f002.jpg"><br>  Overall dimensions have somewhat decreased, however, due to the closed case, the weight has almost doubled - from 6.5 to 11 kg.  At the same time, despite the new constructional design, the printing process can be monitored at any stage due to the transparency of the front panel, and for convenience, the developers have provided the illumination of the working area.  In addition to a purely visual control, there is the possibility of viewing the technical details of the operations performed - all information is displayed on a liquid crystal display and here are some service functions.  Externally, the Picaso 3D Designer is already much more like office equipment than its futuristic predecessor.  Typical office attributes such as USB connectors and an external Micro-SD slot also appeared.  These seemingly small touches are actually quite important - the equipment is no longer frightening with its cumbersome appearance, and can be quite organically incorporated into the workspace. <br><br><h2>  In work <br></h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/48f/5b4/eb5/48f5b4eb5440e004a6fde5c5cc803280.jpg"></div><br>  Printer chassis is made of metal.  The base was the construction that had already been worked out in the Builder, but the mechanical component was significantly improved, and the upgrades were made based on the experience of the debut model.  The dimensions of the print area are 200 x 200 x 210 mm (length x width x height), and the working area is even 10 mm larger than Builder‚Äôs, despite the overall size reduction. <br><br>  The main table is made removable, which is very convenient for mass production of small products.  The automatic calibration mechanism that appeared appeared to be very useful, eliminating the problem of straining the layers during the manufacture of complex models. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1d0/1d6/f70/1d01d6f703800c8e47e340887b9da8ec.jpg"></div><br>  Thanks to the reworking of the nozzles, the printing speed increased from 25 cm3 / hour to 30 cm3 / hour, and the minimum layer thickness now is not 100, but 50 (!) Microns, which was achieved by changing the print head motion algorithms.  The camera itself now has the ability to set the temperature.  This allows you to make products that do not crack in layers as a result of thermal expansion. <br><br>  The wall thickness of the printed products increased from 0.19 to 0.27 mm, but the PLA and ABS plastics are used as the material for printing.  It is noteworthy that with a rather significant improvement in the technical characteristics, the equipment became more economical - the power requirements are 0.3 kW versus 0.5 kW Builder. <br><br><h2>  Functional &amp; software part </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img alt="image" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b36/7fd/ec0/b367fdec06e0757a1133c44f92c5ae3f.jpg"></div><br>  Picaso 3D Designer is focused not only on the needs of large companies, but also on small-scale production and even on individual consumers.  According to the company's management, over the next decade, the share of goods created by consumers themselves will increase to 5-10%, and from 30 to 50% of such products will be created using 3D printers. <br><br>  Time will tell if this forecast comes true or not.  In the meantime, you can familiarize yourself with what has been done to adapt a rather complex technique to the needs of a wide range of consumers. <br>  One of the most important steps was the emergence of detailed instructions.  It would seem that such an insignificant nuance, but as practice has shown, a good third of calls to branded service centers were caused not by technical defects of equipment, but by a commonplace ignorance of how to implement this or that function.  To eliminate such an annoying misunderstanding, the instruction has become not only more detailed, but also much more saturated in terms of visual material. <br>  3D Designer in comparison with Builder'om became much more friendly to manage.  The interface now has all the rights to claim the title ‚Äúintuitively understandable,‚Äù and the Picaso Polygon proprietary software suffered some changes.  At the same time, the essence remains the same - print tasks are generated in the STL format, and the basic 3D model can be created in almost any modern editor (AutoCad, Compass, 3ds Max, SolidWorks, Google SketchUp, etc.) <br><br><h2>  Overall impression </h2><br>  Despite the completely Russian assembly, Picaso 3D Designer is perceived quite positively.  The stylish and thoughtful design in terms of ergonomics distinguishes it from the somewhat elaborate Builder, while in terms of its functionality the device is quite comparable with the best foreign analogues.  The price, of course, absolutely cannot be called democratic, but 99 tons.  still fall into a completely reasonable range, and you can afford it even when you update your home environment. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img alt="8-new" height="270" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ea9/8b8/d7d/ea98b8d7d30e3ef867d333170f4787db.jpg" width="400"></div>  Go <br>  <a href="https://3dcubis.autokassir.ru/%3Fr%3Dac%26id%3D1%26lg%3Dru">Learn details and order Picaso 3D Designer here.</a> <a href="https://3dcubis.autokassir.ru/%3Fr%3Dac%26id%3D1%26lg%3Dru"><br></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/205812/">https://habr.com/ru/post/205812/</a></p>
