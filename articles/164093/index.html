Having looked at ebee horse prices for similar devices, plus at least horse prices for delivery to the village of Moscow, I looked in the direction of the hammer, and, oh, a wonderful device appeared to my eyes, for only 400 rubles (~ 10 ‚Ç¨). <br><br>  But it‚Äôs interesting not only to get the thing, but to clean it, fix it, set it up and watch for one how it works.  So let's proceed to the autopsy of this retro-patient. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  First meeting </h4><br><br>  Let's start with the look.  The phone itself is very heavy, has a steel base, the handset has a beautiful chiseled shape. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9f9/d3a/1ee/9f9d3a1eef77f651826dadf67c096a15.jpg"><br>  <b>View from above</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ba1/218/4de/ba12184dead5a9f74af52fbe592e7483.jpg"><br>  <b>Off hook</b> <br><br>  I was very pleased with the metal reset lugs, or rather the lever, as I was right corrected. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/472/64c/8a5/47264c8a5c760ffa5cc47cfab4edec80.jpg"><br>  <b>Chrome Reset Tongues</b> <br><br>  Phone brand <i>VEF</i> , as evidenced by <s>stamping</s> stamping on the body and on the tube <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9ce/948/d45/9ce948d45f9ba23058db08cc7b70dd82.jpg"><br>  <b>Stamping on the machine</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/211/92b/466/21192b46696fb18a708a3207d49edaa6.jpg"><br>  <b>Stamping on the tube</b> <br><br>  What we are beating around the bush, let's see what is inside of it !!! <br><br><h4>  Goodwill </h4><br><br>  We start with the disassembly of the tube.  The microphone on the phone did not work.  And as it turned out later, there, firstly, there was not a native microphone, and secondly, the seller simply inserted the first available wire into two conductors there, although the tube is connected via a four-wire cord.  Therefore, a microphone, even if it was there, could not work.  Looking ahead I will say that I replaced this cord with a kosher twisted wire from an old clave. <br>  In the place of the microphone, there are 4 more terminals, to which the wires from the main unit are attached, and a rather complicated device for connecting the microphone.  It must be contacted with a central contact and two protruding screws.  In the photo, the microphone is not native, and can not and should not <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/efd/a3f/53b/efda3f53b459317c8e8dc8e3a9217a8b.jpg"><br>  <b>Disassembled microphone</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e46/534/c8a/e46534c8a45dbdda042da7fe31268534.jpg"><br>  <b>Larger</b> <br><br>  If you unscrew the two screws on top, you can remove this plastic ‚Äúsquiggle‚Äù and gain access to the terminals themselves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/936/c4e/20a/936c4e20ac045628f1f1217358d4b4f6.jpg"><br>  <b>Removed plastic hrenulka.</b>  <b>It can be seen that there are only two wires to the FOUR terminals (only the speaker works).</b> <br><br>  Not less, but even more interesting is the speaker.  In essence, this is an electromagnet, on which a steel membrane is placed on top.  Moreover, the contours of the tube are also magnetic (i.e., the membrane is magnetized).  The device is simply eternal and has no demolition. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ed9/fdb/a79/ed9fdba79bed6a142ed4aff4a9d68733.jpg"><br>  <b>Disassembled speaker.</b>  <b>On the right is the membrane.</b> <br><br><h4>  We climb into the body </h4><br><br>  Turn the phone over and gently (I said GENTLY!) Lay it on its side. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bb5/6d0/814/bb56d0814f9509b0992fcbbf2bfda476.jpg"><br><h4>  The phone lay on its side </h4><br><br>  All bowels are closed with a plate that has latches on the side.  Just insert a screwdriver, press lightly and it will open.  At first, I thought that the case would bend, or somehow the screwdriver would spoil it.  But nifiga, everything was just fine! <br><br>  We remove the cover, and on there we conveniently draw the connection diagram, year of manufacture and brand of the phone <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1aa/bf3/4de/1aabf34de725dca61c0af285c391f2cd.jpg"><br>  <b>Nameplate inside the cover.</b>  <b>Telephone apparatus BAGTA-50, 1963.</b> <br><br>  I am sincerely interested in what the <b>CB SPECIAL</b> means? <br><br>  Putting the lid aside and see the following picture: the lion's share of the space is occupied by the bell, the bottom of the terminal block is located at the entrance, two wires are on the left handset (before rework), the right is the telephone network. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/175/6ea/d8c/1756ead8c3ba13be30f32e9e696985b0.jpg"><br>  <b>Basement</b> <br><br>  The particular fat that the basement of the phone is made of steel!  What adds color to the phone, weight and turns it into a dangerous weapon :))).  The only thing that is painted by some country is paint, which dissolves in isopropyl alcohol (along with analysis I wiped it). <br><br>  We unscrew the only two screws, and remove the basement from the carbolite case.  On the other side of the basement there is a red crap <s>(I believe that the transformer)</s> , as I was told, is a coupling capacitor, and the tongue of the disconnector.  On wires hangs shrink.  Judging by the fact that in 1963 there was no heat shrinkage, the phone was being repaired in our time <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1b1/675/4ae/1b16754aee824f142b8d2ce8e60d2157.jpg"><br>  <b>Inner side of the basement</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/48c/1a8/4d4/48c1a84d4cf8f567c7483af0f394e3d5.jpg"><br>  <b>Another view</b> <br><br>  In the plastic part, the gaze mechanism appears to our gaze.  I tried to take it off twenty times, but everything turned out not to be of high quality, so what are the rich <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/39a/882/fce/39a882fce18a5f83e9cc164361464690.jpg"><br>  <b>Numeronbearer</b> <br><br>  Unfortunately, the dial dial on the return is jammed.  Liters of isopropyl, and then lubricants poured on bearings and gears, cleaning the already clean gears did not lead to anything: (((((. <br><br>  Numeronabiratel can also unscrew and remove.  And completely rip off.  Interestingly, the numbers are applied to the aluminum plate and have not wiped off completely over the years. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3ca/8ef/a60/3ca8efa60e63d8863637d95e8688bc1c.jpg"><br>  <b>Numeronabulator before final cleaning</b> <br><br>  After thoroughly wiping all the nooks of the phone with isopropyl, I decided to change the tube wire to something more cool.  Since I do not have the original wire, I took it from the keyboard.  It turned out very authentic.  I really blunted at two in the morning with the scheme, but did everything <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/60d/f4d/384/60df4d384a28d63a3ea9df27ad7b1caf.jpg"><br>  <b>Final version</b> <br><br>  The microphone does not work yet, I think to make a small scheme to forget the carbon microphones forever and put on a ‚Äúperpetual‚Äù dynamic microphone. <br><br>  To connect it to our network, I had to pick up just such parsley <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5e4/00a/4a8/5e400a4a852e08a87f15c28301e86379.jpg"><br>  <b>Collective farm</b> <br><br>  As a result, you can enjoy a pleasant call and beep in the dynamics.  Especially for this, even shot a video.  Unfortunately, the sound of the speaker is not very audible, but believe me - it is.  Ping check - everything works, it rings (or rings). <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/WsBtYmfDxBw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgOCR9k_RmHPKmdHF1ThjpceizbXA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  By the way, for reference, I was always very interested in: why do letters are put on numerators (by the way, both in our and Western phones)?  It turns out that this is the type of possibility to dial a number not only tsiferno, but also literally (convenience of memorization).  In my very uncomfortable.  I see no problem remembering a ten-digit number. <br><br>  The phone went just in perfect condition.  It seems that it was used extremely rarely.  Inside was clean enough, my cellphone inside is dirtier.  I thought he would be stained to death, it turned out not.  Although the traces of the old owner did exist (I diligently destroyed them with isopropyl).  The funny irony is that the former owner is most likely dead, and the phone is there, it works and it will still work! <br><br>  I bow to this. <br><br>  ZY  He wrote in Googlebox, according to this, please note the errors, inaccuracies, comments on the article, send the shortcomings by a personal message - everything will be promptly corrected as far as possible. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/164093/">https://habr.com/ru/post/164093/</a></p>
