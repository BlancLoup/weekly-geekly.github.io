  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Alexander Steshenko: ‚ÄúOver the 4 months of work as a freelancer, the remuneration of my work has increased 3 times‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Six months ago, Alexander was a young specialist with no work experience.  He was taken to the office only for a modest salary of a novice specialist.  He did not agree and went into freelancing ... Today he earns 1.5 times more than he could get in the office.  His name is to work three local companies, but he still thinks.  Still, change the freelance to the office ... Maybe in the future will try to combine both directions.  Finally, ‚Äúyou have to experience everything in order to at least have the right to prove something to people.‚Äù  Meet - Alexander Steshenko [nick lcf]. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Sersh:</b> As far as I know, you are relatively new to freelancing.  Your <a href="http://free-lance.ru/users/lcfsoft">account on Free-Lance.ru is</a> only 4 months old, and the rating is already above 1500 :) Plus many positive reviews from customers and freelancers.  So the first question is - how did you find out about freelancing?  How did your freelancer career begin and how did it develop? <br>  <b>Alexander:</b> When I was worried about finding a job in my specialty, I had normal access to the Internet, I was searching there, <a href="http://www.weblancer.net/">too</a> ... following the advice of my friend, I went to the <a href="http://www.weblancer.net/">Weblancer.net</a> site.  After seeing what it is, I launched the search for the word ‚ÄúFreelance‚Äù on the network, discovered the site <a href="http://www.kadrof.ru/">Kadrof.ru</a> , from there I found out about the other resources ... And, after earning the first five hundred rubles, after a time equivalent to one working day, I decided that it was a good option .  At least worth a try.  Now I have been doing freelancing for just over five months. <br>  It began with the simplest task.  Honestly, I try to remember what work I did first and I can not :) In this regard, freelancing makes me very happy: the dispersion of tasks for the complexity and necessary qualifications of the performer contributes to the smooth development of any person in a profession that interests him.  I'm not an exception.  Studying new technologies, programming languages, standards and recommendations, I get money and enjoyment from work. <br>  <b>Sersh:</b> Everyone comes to freelancing for their own reasons.  What were you? <br>  <b>Alexander:</b> This is a great job.  In general, I started working to do the same thing as I did, only for money.  :) <br>  <b>Sersh:</b> How did you manage to get the first order? <br>  <b>Alexander:</b> Unfortunately, I remember badly.  I only remember that it is not difficult. :) You just offer services, do some of the work ‚Äî a person sees that you understand what you are doing, prepay, and so on ... a simple scheme.  And if there is a portfolio and recommendations (which are not at all difficult, it turned out to be earned), then you can immediately demand prepayment. <br>  <b>Sersh:</b> You have an impressive list of skills and knowledge.  What are your services most in demand on the Internet? <br>  <b>Alexander:</b> This is undoubtedly web programming.  That is, when I came to the world of freelancing, I had good skills in application programming, system and others.  But really, to be in demand, you need to program it for the Internet.  Although freelancing can find a good permanent job specialist of any profile.  If you add specifics, then most of my orders are to finish, find a mistake and fix it, expand the functionality.  Although, there are offers from scratch - a shop, a blog, etc. <br>  <b>Sersh:</b> How do you look for orders, how do you attract customers, how do you advertise yourself? <br>  <b>Alexander:</b> Well, low cost with good quality work and an empty portfolio - as an option to start.  Although recently I have noticed that my wages have increased three times, without a drop in demand =) This is good news.  There is a site, <a href="http://lcf.name/">http://lcf.name</a> - there has recently been my resume (who would have made a human design for me ... :) There are reviews and works.  And now I am already among the top five rated on <a href="http://www.free-lance.ru/">Free-lance.ru</a> (and if I buy a PRO account that is fashionable from them, I will be the third for the moment, but I honestly don‚Äôt see any reason for that ...) .  That is, in general, now it is enough for me to tell the person that I am ready to fulfill his order, and he will most likely turn to me.  I am always polite with customers and offer them a flexible system of discounts, free bonuses, etc.  So far everyone likes.  And this is just three months on this site!  I advise everyone to try yourself in freelancing! <br>  <b>Sersh:</b> Where do orders come from most?  It happens that the customer himself refers to you?  For example, on a recommendation from another employer? <br>  <b>Alexander: For the</b> first three months I searched for them myself.  He answered the projects, waited, who would respond.  Although there were a couple of orders when people themselves applied.  He was surprised, asked why it was to me - they said that they just poked at random.  Now look for orders constantly, in principle, there is no need.  Although it is very convenient to do some petty work ala ‚Äúa form for sending an email‚Äù or something else in this spirit, for warming up before serious work.  70% of orders from the site <a href="http://www.free-lance.ru/">Free-lance.ru</a> .  The rest is from <a href="http://www.weblancer.net/">Weblancer.net</a> and from somewhere else :) <br>  <b>Sersh:</b> Not afraid to work without prepayment?  How do you protect yourself from "kidkov"? <br>  <b>Alexander:</b> I'm afraid.  Twice thrown in the beginning.  Without prepayment I do not work now.  Even when ordering for a couple of three hours of work and 10-15 dollars.  From the principle.  I offer customers this type of calculation, as I said above.  Those.  I first see what kind of person it is for communication and correspondence, if it seems to be normal, I do a small part of the work, then prepay, from 20% of the total cost.  Otherwise, just no way. <br>  <b>Sersh: Do you</b> plan to remain a freelancer or go to the office in the future? <br>  <b>Alexander:</b> In the future I plan to look for talented people, and make orders more serious together.  There are orders, there are connections and acquaintances, it‚Äôs just not enough for me alone.  In the office name.  I will try to combine necessarily.  It is necessary to test everything in order to at least have the right to prove something to people.  Although now I have about 1.5 times more money for freelancing than in the office where I can work in Taganrog. <br>  <b>Sersh:</b> Do you think you can combine office work and freelancing? <br>  <b>Alexander:</b> Yes, I think you can.  Depends on which office.  It happens that even in the ceiling spit :) <br>  <b>Sersh:</b> What are the advantages of freelancing? <br>  <b>Alexander:</b> Freedom, professional development, the choice of work for the soul.  You can take a vacation any day of the week of any month.  I think they are obvious and much has already been said about them. <br>  <b>Sersh:</b> I noticed many times that the richest freelancers are either programmers or designers.  Copywriters, translators in the mass receive less.  Why do you think? <br>  <b>Alexander:</b> Copywriter is easy to throw.  Like a translator.  These are professions that are more difficult to exist remotely. <br>  <b>Sersh:</b> How is your day freelancer?  How much time do you give to work, do you work on weekends and holidays? <br>  <b>Alexander:</b> It turns out, in fact, somewhere the same way as if working in an office - that is, about 8 hours.  But I choose the time myself.  That is, it often happens that I do not sleep at night or vice versa - I wake up at 6 in the morning.  I can work at the weekend easily, or not work.  Always different, no permanence. <br>  <b>Sersh:</b> What is work for you? <br>  <b>Alexander:</b> For me personally, this is at the same time a great pleasure, a way to get money (as a result - and all other necessary things) and the opportunity to improve constantly. <br>  <b>Sersh:</b> How do you feel about the lack of official work experience?  After all, a freelancer, if he does not work in the office, there is nothing to write to the workplace. <br>  <b>Alexander:</b> This is not about programmers.  Never take you to work because of the entry in the book.  Like the designers.  In my opinion, the availability of finished works, decisions and recommendations reflect my professional skills better than writing in a book.  Although this is a moot point. <br>  <b>Sersh:</b> What do you want to achieve in life as a programmer? <br>  <b>Alexander:</b> :) For some time I understand that programmers can get a lot ... but not like some ordinary oil workers, say, companies.)) For a normal life (meaning normal life not by Russian standards, but in general) you need a lot work.  Therefore, I want to try to somehow compete in the market of software companies or something in this area, I don‚Äôt know for sure ... Even I plan to get a second degree in economics.  It seems like a necessary highlight I have :) <br>  <b>Sersh:</b> There are people who basically need to work in the office, are on the staff and have a record in labor.  There are people who can only work as freelancers.  I am interested to know your opinion, how do they, in your opinion, differ from each other? <br>  <b>Alexander:</b> In a nutshell, with a mindset, risk predisposition, creativity.  I think someone has more - of course. <br>  <b>Sersh:</b> Have any of your friends become like freelancers? <br>  <b>Alexander:</b> On my recommendation, one person tried.  And he is very talented, he immediately made a flash drive for $ 100.  Just a couple of days, and stopped.  He is lazy ... and young, while parents provide :) <br>  <b>Sersh:</b> Why do so many young professionals who graduated from <b>high school</b> , go to work for a modest salary in the office.  Why are they not interested in freelancing? <br>  <b>Alexander:</b> Many do not know.  Many are afraid or do not trust.  I hope my example will dispel at least some of the doubts and at least people will try.  Even people sometimes do not like the lack of a social package and similar things, although this can be done both by yourself and by opening a pension fund and the like. <br>  <b>Sersh:</b> Where, in your opinion, do you get more experience and grow faster, as a specialist, in freelancing or in the office? <br>  <b>Alexander:</b> I think it does not even depend on which office.  It always means rubber time (well, almost always), they pay for freelance not for time, but for skills.  Definitely - freelance. <br>  <b>Sersh:</b> Many people say that a freelancer is a loser who is not taken to work in an office.  Do you agree with this statement? <br>  <b>Alexander:</b> Nothing of the kind, I would even say the opposite.  I have three sentences in my city, wherever I want - they will take it.  Although for some people, this may be true.  But I do not like such people. <br>  <b>Sersh:</b> Do you have experience working with western customers?  If so, tell me more about it. <br>  <b>Alexander:</b> I tried it once.  While there is no need to go out there.  There, the pace is even more frantic than ours.  Dumping crazy ... probably, all the countries of the third world earn additionally))) <br>  <b>Sersh:</b> Which customers pay more?  From Moscow, the CIS countries, from the regions? <br>  <b>Alexander:</b> Definitely from Moscow.  They have a completely different idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmoney than in the regions. <br>  <b>Sersh:</b> Many freelancers, in the process of work, make up a typology of customers.  Do you have your own typology of customers, for example, difficult, easy, with Ponte?  This is not my typology, this is just for example :) <br>  <b>Alexander:</b> Yes.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äù, ‚Äúyou‚Äù, ‚Äúyou‚Äù, ‚Äúgreat, dude‚Äù I try not to have things with the rest.  Those.  rough with ponts, etc. <br>  <b>Sersh:</b> Do freelancers need a personal website?  And if so, for what? <br>  <b>Alexander:</b> I don‚Äôt think I need it, but it is a kind of indicator of the status of a freelancer (that is, if a person is willing to spend money and time on his advertising, then he probably is not the first day in this business) And for a portfolio, it can really be convenient. <br>  <b>Sersh:</b> What are your wishes for freelancers? <br>  <b>Alexander:</b> Good luck and most importantly - to be confident in yourself! <br>  <b>Sersh:</b> Your personal motto? <br>  <b>Alexander:</b> There is no motto that could be expressed in words ... At the level of sensations, this is something like "work, work, work ...))) <br>  <b>Sersh:</b> Thanks for the answers! <br>  Source: <a href="http://www.kadrof.ru/">Portal about freelancing and remote work Kadrof.ru</a> </div>
