  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Toshiba Upgrade Action: Organizational File</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Toshiba's promotion of exchanging old laptops for new ones at a discount has attracted a lot of attention, including on Habr√©, and has probably become a very successful image move for the company.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe action is really good - however, trying to participate in it, found that it was embodied much worse, so I decided to write this topic so that the public knew both sides of what was happening. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Everything was badly organized before the start of the action itself - many people know this part, but for the sake of completeness, I‚Äôll bring it: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://toshiba-upgrade.ru/terms.html">The rules</a> on the official website were striking in their vagueness - there were no answers to the key questions for many about which laptops could be handed over, and only ‚Äúusability‚Äù was reported, which can be interpreted differently.  Even on the website of one of the partner stores, the rules were more complete (it was said about ‚Äúloading the operating system‚Äù), but it was not clear whether they belong to this store or to all those participating in the promotion. </li><li>  At the same time, the official site did not indicate either a telephone or an email address at which one could ask a question. </li><li>  Toshiba, having an official blog on Habr√©, for some reason didn‚Äôt think it necessary to inform him about the action (although it would be convenient for everyone to ask questions caused by vagueness of the rules). </li><li>  As a result, a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/laptop/97738/">topic with criticism appeared</a> , caused by the fact that its author misunderstood the rules (if there was an official topic with the ability to ask a question, it would not have come to that).  Then Toshiba finally stepped up and began to respond in the comments to the questions that had accumulated in people, but it did it strangely.  First, responding with categorical prohibitions (‚Äúno netbooks can be‚Äù, ‚Äúno batteries can be dead‚Äù), the company did not introduce these prohibitions into official rules (netbooks finally appeared, but at the last moment), although not all read Habr, but These questions, as has become clear, concern many.  Secondly, the company sometimes <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/laptop/97738/">contradicted itself</a> . </li></ul><br><br>  Now about the action itself.  He brought an ancient laptop to RiK in a terrible state, but it started up - not really expecting to be accepted, more out of interest: I wanted to try to convince that technically it could be called suitable for work, even if nobody had thought of working for it for a long time (well, then, I did not lose anything, but there was a small chance of getting a discount).  In the store, it turned out that the queue for checking laptops and paperwork is moving extremely slowly;  ‚ÄúRiCa‚Äù employees apologized and said that the regulations established Toshiba, so they cannot do anything.  ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/laptop/97738/">They</a> also <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/laptop/97738/">write</a> that in other places everything was much worse, but there it was already the fault of the store).  However, this was not the worst of the discoveries - it turned out later that <b>laptops with mechanical damage are not accepted to be larger than a scratch, although the official rules did not say a word about it</b> .  I saw how a person was denied access to a laptop because of the broken corner of the plastic panel, although it was impossible to call the laptop ‚Äúunusable‚Äù on this basis.  As the store employees said, this item is included in the full rules that Toshiba sent them. <br>  I can‚Äôt complain about my fate (as I said, I didn‚Äôt hope to pass), but I suppose that many others were already sure of receiving a discount, asked for this from work on a weekday, urgently took their old laptops from their friends, stood an hour in the queue - just to find out that Toshiba didn‚Äôt consider it necessary to inform them properly (although Toshiba‚Äôs efforts needed absolutely minimal ones - you didn‚Äôt even have to think about the answers, it was enough to take the already formulated for stores  answers and post them on the site).  I think that from Toshiba now it would be good to at least apologize to these people. </div>
