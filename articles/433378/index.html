      <b>Professor:</b> in practice it happens.  Developers know that whenever the interpreter does this kind of work, when returning the return value, a special code is used that automatically assigns an infected value to the system.arraycopy () operation, which should be associated with it. <br><br>  <b>Student:</b> correct, but then what is the manual part of the work? <br><br>  <b>Professor: The</b> manual part is basically to figure out what the policy for performing the check should be.  In other words, if you just look at standard TaintDroid or standard Android, they will do something for you, but they will not be able to automatically assign Taint in the correct way.  So someone must manually assign a tracking policy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qs/1g/rw/qs1grwvpjf_tzxabqcla7wt8m1e.jpeg"><br><br>  This does not seem to be a big problem in practice.  But if the number of applications that use computer-oriented methods has steadily increased, then we may have small problems. <br><br>  Another type of data to worry about in terms of assigning an infection is the IPC message.  IPC messages are essentially treated as arrays.  Therefore, each of these messages will be associated with a single common taint, which is the union of infections of all components. <br><br>  This contributes to the effectiveness of the system, because we need to store only one taint tag for each of these messages.  In a pinch, the extent of the infection will simply reevaluate, but it will never lead to a deterioration in security.  The worst thing that can happen in this case is that the network will not get data that could get there without any dangerous consequences for confidentiality. <br><br>  So, when you create an IPC message, it receives a combined taint.  When you read what you received in this message, the extracted data gets an infection from the message itself, which makes sense.  This is how IPC messages are processed. <br><br>  Also it is worth worrying about how the file is processed.  Therefore, each file receives one taint tag, and this tag is stored along with the file in its metadata on a stable storage medium, such as an SD memory card.  Here the same conservative approach to infection takes place as in the previous cases.  The basic idea is that the application gets access to some sensitive data, for example, the GPS location, and may be going to write this data to a file, so TaintDroid updates the taint tag of this file with the GPS flag, after which the application closes.  Later, perhaps, some other application that reads this file is included. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ue/it/ls/ueitls0l1p6v5iw8e-w3ck_j1di.jpeg"><br><br>  When he gets into the virtual machine, into the application, TaintDroid sees that he has this flag, and therefore any data retrieved while reading this file will also have this GPS flag.  I think it's pretty simple. <br><br>  So what kind of things can we infect from a Java perspective?  Basically there are five types of Java objects that need taint flags.  First, these are local variables Local variables that are used in the method.  Returning to the previous examples, we can assume that such a variable is char c. <br><br>  Therefore, we must assign flags to these elements.  The second type is the arguments of the Method arguments method, they must also have infection flags.  Both of these things live on the stack, so TaintDroid should keep track of the purpose of the flags and whatnot for these types of objects. <br>  We also need to assign flags to the instance fields of the Object instance fields.  Imagine that there is a certain object C, this is a circle, and I want to know its radius.  Thus, we have the c.radius field, and we need to link information about the infection of each of these fields: with and radius. <br>  The fourth type of Java object is the fields of the static classes of the Static class fields, which also need taint information.  It could be something like circle.property, that is, a description of the properties of the circle for which we assign some information taint. <br><br>  The fifth type is the Arrays arrays that we talked about earlier, and we assign one common piece of information about the infection to the entire array. <br><br>  The basic idea of ‚Äã‚Äãimplementing taint flags for these types of Java objects is that we will try to keep the taint flags for a variable next to the variable itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wv/iu/lm/wviulmztf3fscd2zzbqwog8l0ys.jpeg"><br><br>  Let's say we have some kind of integer variable, and we want to put some taint pollution with it.  We want to try to keep this state as close as possible to a variable, perhaps for reasons of ensuring that the cache operates efficiently at the processor level.  If we stored taint very far away from this variable, this can cause problems, because after the interpreter looks at the value of memory for this actual Java variable, it will want to read information about its infection as quickly as possible. <br><br>  If we look at the move-op operation, we note that in these places of the code, dst and src, when the interpreter considers the values, it also considers the corresponding taint infestations. <br><br>  Thus, by placing these things as close as possible to each other, you are trying to ensure more efficient use of the cache.  This is done quite simply.  If you look at what developers are doing for the arguments of the methods and the local variables that live in the stack, you can see that they essentially select the taint flags near the place where the variables are located. <br><br>  Suppose that we have a favorite thing in our lectures, a stack diagram, which you will probably soon hate for being frequently mentioned.  Let local variable 0 be located in our stack, then TaintDroid will store in memory a tag about infection of this variable right below it.  If next you have another variable, its tag will also be located directly below it, and so on.  It is quite simple.  All these things will be located on the same cache line, which will make accessing memory less expensive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tt/3v/pv/tt3vpvampplexx7uhtlbyodwi4e.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Student:</b> I wonder how you can have one flag for a whole array and different flags for each property of an object.  What if one of the object's methods can access the data stored in its properties?  That would be ... see what I mean? <br><br>  <b>Professor:</b> you ask about the reason for the application of such a policy? <br><br>  <b>Student:</b> yes, about the reason for using such a policy. <br><br>  <b>Professor:</b> I think this is done to ensure effective implementation.  Probably, there are other rules - for example, they do not report the length of the data array, because information leakage is possible, so they do not spread the infection to this indicator.  So I think some decisions are made simply for efficiency reasons.  In principle, there is nothing that would prevent the provision of access to each element of the array to indicate that the item to the left receives taint only from some specific elements. <br><br>  However, it is not clear whether this will be correct, because, apparently, if you place something in an array, then this thing should know something about this array.  Therefore, I think that developers use a combination of both policies.  Being overly conservative, you should not allow data leaks that you want to protect, but at the same time, to have access to the array, you need to know something about it.  And when you need to know something about something, it usually means that you are using taint. <br><br>  So this is the basic scheme they use to store all this information next to each other.  One can imagine that the same is done for the fields of the classes and for the fields of the objects.  When you declare a class, you have some slot memory for a particular variable, and right next to this slot is information about taint for this variable.  So I think this is all pretty reasonable. <br><br>  This is how TaintDroid works.  When the system is initialized or at another system time, TaintDroid looks at all sources of potentially infected information and assigns a flag to each of these things ‚Äî the GPS sensor, the camera, and so on.  As the program progresses, it will extract confidential information from these sources, after which the interpreter will consider all types of functions in accordance with the table provided in the article to figure out how to spread taint infection through the system. <br><br>  The most interesting thing happens when data tries to penetrate the system.  TaintDroid can control network interfaces and see everything that it tries to go through.  He looks at the presence of taint tags, and if the data that is trying to penetrate the network have one or more of these flags, they will be prohibited from using the network.  What happens at this moment actually depends on the application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rf/cr/qr/rfcrqr1ldetozmh2jduweccb6dg.jpeg"><br><br>  For example, TaintDroid may show a warning to the user, which says that someone is trying to send information about his location to the side.  It is possible that TaintDroid contains built-in policies that allow an application to go online, but also clear all sensitive data that it will attempt to transfer, and so on.  In the article, this mechanism is not described in sufficient detail, since the authors were primarily concerned with the issue of ‚Äúleakage‚Äù of data into the network. <br><br>  In the section of the article titled ‚ÄúEvaluation‚Äù, some of the things found in the process of studying the system are discussed.  So, the authors of the article found that Android applications would try to extract data in ways that the user would not see.  Suppose they try to use your location for advertising, they send your number to a remote server, and so on.  It is important to note that these applications, as a rule, do not ‚Äúbreak‚Äù the Android security model in the sense that the user must allow them access to the network or allow them to use the contact list.  However, applications do not provide information in the EULA license agreement that they are going to send a phone number to some Silk Road 8 server or something like that.  In fact, this is deception and misleading users as to the true intentions of the application, because if they had seen these EULA requirements and knew what they were fraught with, they could have thought whether to install such an application on their smartphone or not. <br><br>  <b>Student:</b> it can be assumed that even if they placed these requirements in a licensing agreement, it would not have given anything, because people usually do not read the EULA. <br><br>  <b>Professor:</b> this is quite a reasonable assumption, because even computer science experts do not always check the license agreement.  However, such honesty in the EULA would still be beneficial, because there are people who actually read the license agreement.  But you are absolutely right, assuming that users will not read a bunch of pages written in small print, they simply click "agree" and install the application. <br><br>  So, I think that the rules for passing information through the system are quite simple, as we have said, taint just moves from the right side to the left side.  However, sometimes these rules for the flow of information may have somewhat contradictory results. <br>  Imagine that the application implements its own class of linked lists.  We have a simple class called ListNode, it will have an object field for Object data and a ListNode next object that represents the next list. <br><br>  Suppose the application assigned infected data to the Object data field ‚Äî confidential information received from a GPS sensor or something else.  The question is that when we calculate the length of this list, should it be infected?  It will amaze you that the answer to the question will be ‚Äúno‚Äù, which is explained by how TaintDroid and some of these systems define the information flow.  Let's take a look at what it means to add a node to a linked list. <br><br>  Adding a node consists of 3 steps.  So the first thing you do is select a new list node that contains the data you want to add ‚Äî Alloc ListNode.  The second step is you assign the data field of this new node.  And the third thing you do is use some kind of patch for ListNode next to merge nodes into a list - this is the ‚Äúnext‚Äù ptr pointer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hz/g7/gy/hzg7gyf7ai7afdbcr6aegsm6keu.jpeg"><br><br>  Interestingly, the third step is not related to the data field at all; it simply considers the following value.  As soon as the Object data is infected, we begin to calculate the length of the list, starting with some head node, go through all the "next" ptr pointers and simply count how many pointers have passed.  So the counting algorithm does not touch the infected data. <br><br>  Interestingly, if you have a linked list that is filled with infected data and then its length is calculated, it will not generate an infected value.  This may seem a little illogical, although considering arrays, we have already said that the length of the array also does not contain taint.  Here is the same reason.  Toward the end of the lecture, we will discuss how you can use a language that allows you as a programmer to determine your own types of infection, and then you can develop your own policy for such things. <br>  The good thing about TaintDroid is that you, as a developer, don't have to label anything, TaintDroid does it for you.  He notes all confidential things that can be a source of information, and all things that can be ‚Äúsinks‚Äù of information, so you, as a developer, are ready to work.  But if you want to control the addition of nodes, you may have to create some policies yourself. <br>  How does TaintDroid affect system performance?  Existing overhead actually seems pretty reasonable.  The overhead of memory is to store all tags of infections.  The load on the processor will mainly consist of the purpose, distribution and verification of these infections, and it should be noted that the use of the Dalvik virtual machine is an additional job.  So, looking at the source, looking at this 32-bit information about the infection, we perform operations that have already been considered.  This is computational overhead. <br><br>  These overheads seem rather moderate.  As the authors of the article report, storing taint tags requires from 3% to 5% additional memory, so this is not so bad.  The load on the processor is somewhat higher and can reach from 3% to 29% of computing power.  This is due to the fact that every time the loop is executed, the interpreter needs to look at these tags and perform the corresponding operations.  Although these are just bitwise operations, they need to be performed all the time.  This is not bad even in the case of a load of 29%, because the developers from Silicon Valley constantly say that modern phones require quad-core processors.  The only problem may arise with the battery, because even if you have additional cores of the processor, you will hardly want to have a hot phone in your pocket, which will begin to ‚Äúblast out‚Äù when trying to calculate these things.  But if your battery is not particularly affected by such calculations, then everything is not so bad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/na/jt/f_/najtf_jyzirll-kpzekiehmstya.jpeg"><br><br>  So, this was a review of how TaintDroid works.  Have questions? <br><br>  <b>Student:</b> tags are marked only what is there all the time?  Or is each variable tagged? <br><br>  <b>Professor:</b> everything is marked, so theoretically nothing prevents you from putting any information about the infection for things that have no infection at all.  I think that as soon as something gets at least one bit of taint, you need to build something like a dynamic change layout.    -     ,     ,     .          taint,   ,    ,   -   ,     ,   .  ,        ,       -   .
