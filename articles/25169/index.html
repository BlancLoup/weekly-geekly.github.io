  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crazy producer allowed internet users to wake up a monster: Cloverfield, part 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The article is devoted to the popular film Cloverfield and the game, which formed the main part of the PR-company of the film.  The film premiered on January 18, 2008, with the beginning of the game in May 2007.  During these 9 months, quite a few events have occurred, which help to more deeply understand the film.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/the_future_is_here/34094.html" title="Cloverfield Part 1">The first part of the</a> article (which I highly recommend reading to all the uninitiated) was written by <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/matt_uza/" class="user_link">Matt_uza</a> . <br><br>  Ok, for a start, a small preamble, a copyright statement and all that.  I waited a long time for the continuation of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/the_future_is_here/34094.html" title="Cloverfield Part 1">first part</a> and even tried to contact its author in ICQ, but did not wait for an answer.  Therefore, I decided to write a sequel myself.  With the author of the main Russian-language sources <a href="http://theos.livejournal.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2b7/5c2/1f7/2b75c21f77c782fe853b053f51463cf8.gif"></a>  <a href="http://theos.livejournal.com/">theos</a> I talked and I think that he will not be against such work. <br>  So I declare that most of the materials are taken from <a href="http://theos.livejournal.com/">theos.livejournal.com</a> and my task was to choose the most interesting and present to you. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1060277/" title="Cloverfield">Cloverfield</a> is a sensational film from the already iconic producer JJ Abrams (also known to us on the TV series <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411008/" title="Lost">Lost</a> ).  The film became famous not only for its original shooting and unusual monster, but also for its huge <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game" title="ARG">ARG</a> , which lasts until now - already 4 months after the film‚Äôs premiere. <br>  Summary of the previous series: <br><ul><li>  Advertising a movie without a name in front of Transformers.

On the site you can see a map with stations marked on it for drilling the seabed (mainly for oil production), named after the Japanese emperors.  <strong>Chuai‚Äôs</strong> newest, fourteenth station is <strong>due</strong> to open in September 2007 and is closest to New York. <br>  One of the leaders of the research says at a press conference that <strong>Tagruato currently</strong> has the latest technology that allows them to work deeply under water and with unprecedented cold, which allows the company to conduct the latest research and mining of various minerals. <br><br>  <strong>The 4th of October.</strong>  Meanwhile, on the site <a href="http://www.jamieandteddy.com/">www.jamieandteddy.com</a> (password: jllovesth) Jamie posted another video <a href="http://youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DEI7h5-ENlT8">youtube.com/watch?v=EI7h5-ENlT8</a> , in which it turns out that Teddy sent her a gift, but very strictly demanded that she not open him until December 9th.  Despite his curiosity, Jamie promises to be patient.

      <strong>October 18th.</strong>  The following video was not long in coming: <a href="http://youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dy4NXLZWPuzM">youtube.com/watch?v=y4NXLZWPuzM</a> <br>  At some party, Jamie stumbled upon the ex-girlfriend Teddy, who became threatened, telling him how Jamie had frolicked with the boys on the dance floor, which according to Jamie is 100% true.  <em>‚ÄúI hope you trust me.</em>  <em>In terms of, you know ... I'm walking here with my friends, and you save the world there, you follow your dream, but you left me here.</em>  <em>I'm lonely, and I went with my girlfriends ... nothing like that</em> . <em>"</em>  At night, she sowed the phone, keys and wallet, and wrote him a message as soon as she got a new phone today.  She also compares them to a couple with a couple: Lily and Jason, She does not want to swear just as they did (which they constantly did last night).  During the conversation, one of the pillows falls and under it you can see that someone is sleeping there.  Jamie says he doesn't even know who it is: most likely, cousin Marlene. <br><br>  <strong>November 12th.</strong>  For almost a month, you have to wait for the next video: <a href="http://youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D_nSO_oRs3sU">youtube.com/watch?v=_nSO_oRs3sU</a> Jamie shows a kind of mini-striptease and complains that Teddy has disappeared and does not let her know anything for 2 days already.  She looks upset. <br><br>  <strong>November 16th</strong>  Finally confirmed the final title of the film: <strong>Cloverfield</strong> <br><br>  <strong>November 22.</strong>  The ‚ÄúNews for Investors‚Äù section appears on the tagruato.jp website.  It contains an open letter from the <strong>Slusho</strong> board <strong>!</strong>  to investors with the assurance that a certain article published by the <strong>Ravall Research Center</strong> is slander and has no relation to reality: "There is no <strong>Maritime Nectar</strong> anywhere but our factories."  The search for the word combination Ravall Research Center leads to the well-known scientific discussion site scienceforums.net, where someone 5Pancakes (5Blinov) asks if you can believe the article of this center (poorly and not fully scanned article attached to the message), which tells about the strange effect of <strong>Slusho!</strong>  on those who drink it.  The author worries about his two children who drink this drink every day. <br>  The article says that due to the fact that <strong>Slusho!</strong>  intends to distribute its drink in the United States, the center conducted a study of nectar, as one of the ingredients.  Due to the strange reaction of the drink to standard research methods, the current composition of the drink could be calculated only approximately. <br>  Of the ingredients that the research could detect, none is hazardous to health, but the question arose of the secret <strong>Sea Nectar</strong> , on the basis of which the beverage advertising company was built and which, as stated in the advertisement, has unusual tonic properties. <br>  Not having received the necessary response from the organization, the Ravalle Research Center somehow managed to get a small sample of <strong>Sea Nectar</strong> . <br>  The report further states that a small dose of <strong>Nectar</strong> briefly caused accelerated cell growth, increased strength, accelerated soft tissue growth of muscles, improved vision, digestion, improved skin condition, and a pleasant sensation all over the body, which one researcher described as a ‚Äúwave of real happiness ".  However, further in the report will be described other effects of exposure to this ingredient.  The description will begin with the infamous and documented case of an 84-year-old woman who drank 12 large glasses of <strong>Slusho!</strong>  and ... (this ends the scanned page). <br><br>  <strong>November 24th</strong>  Site tagruato.jp hack!  Its name changes to <em>‚ÄúTagruato destroys our oceans!‚Äù</em> .  The site has only one picture - a corrected photo from the former site of the company's founder, <strong>Ghana Yoshida</strong> , standing by the window.  He was attached to the devil horns, and outside the window drew a huge wave destroying the city and the four sea creatures. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/554/3d8/3e3/5543d83e3a4a4f06a947d7e677770a2e.jpg"><br>  On the wave and on the sea dwellers, if you take a closer picture and look very carefully (the original picture is here: <a href="">clip2net.com/clip/m4625/1210460778-tagru_hacked-327kb.jpg</a> ), you can find hidden Roman numerals, and on sea dwellers - also words that define the biological appearance of this creature. <br>  I. Tanner (on crab) <br>  Ii.  Irukandji (in jellyfish) <br>  Iii.  Dumbo (octopus) <br>  Iv.  Ogre (on fish) <br>  V. Wave <br><br>  <strong>November 27th.</strong>  In the News for Investors on tagruato.jp there is news that <strong>Tagruato,</strong> with the help of its subsidiary <strong>Bold Futura,</strong> launched its own satellite <strong>Hatsui</strong> .  At first, they wanted to postpone the launch due to weather conditions (rain and thunderstorms), but <strong>Ghana Yoshida</strong> forbade it, and after 5 minutes the launch took place without any incidents.  When asked to Yoshid why he didn‚Äôt allow him to postpone the launch, he replied: <em>‚ÄúBecause here, in Tagruato, we don‚Äôt let the thunderstorm stand in the way of our goals.</em>  <em>In this case, the goal was to reach the stars. ‚Äù</em>  Ghana did not clarify anything about the stars, saying only: <em>"It will be something big</em> . <em>"</em> <br><br>  <strong>November 30th.</strong>  With the ordered clothes from the site slusho.jp (where they now also sell warm jumpers) now not only newspaper snippets come.  In some parcels they find a torn internal document of the company <strong>Tagruato</strong> with the stamp ‚ÄúTop Secret‚Äù - the document is assembled in parts.  The Japanese document says that due to a certain incident, outgoing emails will be checked for several days.  Also, Level 1 employees must remain where they are now until further notice without exception.  (Partially, there is no text on the breaks, which is why the meaning is very inaccurate) <br>  Behind the torn document is a handwritten inscription: <em>‚ÄúAmerican!</em>  <em>Station Chuai keeps a terrible secret.</em>  <em>Good people disappear.</em>  <em>Wait for the connection.</em>  <em>(Signed) Whistling whistle</em> . <br>  The <strong>Chuai</strong> station (closest to New York) is still reported on the newly restored site tagruato.jp, which will open in September 2007, although it is already November. <br><br>  <strong>December 2nd.</strong>  Finally, the secret of hacking tagruato.jp has been solved.  Putting the first letters of the names of sea creatures in Roman numeral order and adding the words Wave to them, they found the site <strong>TIDOWave.com</strong> . <br>  This is the site of the environmental activist group Les Guerriers de M√®re-Terre (Warriors of Mother Earth), founded by Le Bandit Vert (The Green Bandit).  The group opposes <strong>Tagruato</strong> , calling for a halt to its activities, which interfere with the ecosystems of the ocean and destroy them with their stations.  The site contains many unpleasant facts about the suspicious business activity of the company (including with a criminal bias) and about the damage it has caused to the environment by building drilling stations.  The facts are presented in a rather aggressive and in some places too radical manner. <br>  There is also a news about the funeral of Kazui Ichigawa, a marine biologist who unexpectedly retired a few days ago after working at Yoshida Medical Research (medical subsidiary of Tagruato), who turned out to be dead in Daisetsu-San National Park in the popular camping area .  Along with him, his family died: his wife, daughter, and granddaughter.  According to the police, the cause was a gas explosion in their trailer.  His friend and colleague, who wished to remain anonymous, said that he most likely made some extraordinary discovery before retiring.  But his computer and all documents stored in his home are gone, and <strong>Tagruato is</strong> now looking for them. <br><br>  <strong>December 4th.</strong>  Updates on the main characters blogs.  Rob, who tried to invite Bat on dates in the comments, seems to fail.  She finds excuses. <br><br>  <strong>December 10th.</strong>  As we remember, on December 9th, Jamie can already open a teddy's present. <br>  Video 5: <a href="http://youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DupwNxVie3KE">youtube.com/watch?v=upwNxVie3KE</a> <br>  Teddy still has not contacted Jamie - for a month now.  She, annoyed, opens the box in front of the camera.  In the box: cap with <strong>Slusho logo!</strong>  ( <em>‚ÄúThank you for the cap. But, you know, they usually give jewelry‚Äù</em> ), a wrap with something that says <em>‚ÄúBasic evidence.</em>  <em>Immediately freeze!</em>  <em>Jamie, do not eat it "</em> - most likely, <strong>Sea Nectar</strong> and cassette in the player. <br>  On her teddy says that this message is not a joke.  If Jamie hears this before they talk, then <strong>Tagruato has</strong> kidnapped <strong>him</strong> .  <em>"TAG-RU-A-TO"</em> .  He asks the girl not to call the authorities (it will ruin everything), and quietly wait for the call from a certain Randy.  They are currently at the station of this company, and there they either found something, or they are doing something ... but the main thing is that he will not call her again.  She has to wait for a call from Randy.  He will explain ... (at this point, Jamie turns off the cassette). <br>  Jamie is angry and believes that he makes fun of it and just does not want to say that he has another one. <br>  If you look at tidowave.com in the RSS feed you can see that the last two news was published by randy, apparently mentioned on the tape, which means that Teddy most likely worked for <strong>TIDOWave</strong> .  The site also updates the news.  The group was preparing a kind of "event", but it was postponed to December 14th.  Randy is the contact person for this. <br><br>  <strong>December 18th.</strong>  The people who have written in <strong>Tagruato</strong> e-mails receive a letter from their official e-mail, signed, however, by the <strong>Whistling Whistle</strong> .  A letter is a pseunomoisuf.pdf file.  This is an internal document of <strong>Tagruato</strong> in Japanese, scanned along with the English inscription by hand in the same Whistler Whistle handwriting: <em>‚ÄúAmericans!</em>  <em>There is no oil here!</em>  <em>And they knew before building! ‚Äù</em> In the document itself, data on income from drilling stations, except for Chuai. <br>  A new post appears on TidoWave.com: <br>  <em>"I do not know what to say.</em>  <em>I was told to write here.</em>  <em>I have not done this before.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>Uh ...</em>  <em>everything goes wrong as planned.</em>  <em>There were problems with the "event".</em>  <em>Please let me know if you have information about Randy or others.</em>  <em>I'm here alone now.</em>  <em>Really need reinforcements</em> . <em>‚Äù</em> <br><br>  <strong>December 19th.</strong>  Rob is tired of trying to get Bet, and he writes in his diary that he is going to move and find an interesting job.  Each of the characters comments in their own way. <br><br>  <strong>December 26th.</strong>  Video 6: <a href="http://youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DDKXyRxCOlS0">youtube.com/watch?v=DKXyRxCOlS0</a> <br>  Jamie is evil and full of sarcasm.  She's going to call Tag-ga-gato.  Her friend's boyfriend found a number for this company for her.  And she calls to find out who actually kidnapped Teddy.  She asks for someone who speaks "American" on the phone and explains that she is looking for Teddy Hanssen.  It is redirected to another number.  After she repeats who she is looking for, she is asked for her name.  She meets Jamie Lazcano.  The following question is answered: <em>"I am calling from America</em> . <em>"</em>  And then: <em>"I will not tell you my address</em> . <em>"</em>  He hangs up and, turning to the camera, says: <em>‚ÄúSurprise, they have never heard of you.</em>  <em>Guess what?</em>  <em>This is my last video to you.</em>  <em>Enough with me</em> . <em>"</em> <br>  Suddenly the phone rings. <br>  <em>"Hello? .. I do not speak on ... what are you there ..."</em> <br>  She hangs up and sarcastically thanks Teddy for calling her now. <br><br>  <strong>December 29th.</strong> <br>  Beth -&gt; Rob: Hey Rob.  Good luck to you today at the interview!  I'm sure they will like you. <br><br>  <strong>Whistling whistle</strong> sends parts of users who once wrote letters to <strong>Tagruato</strong> e-mail with an attached file.  Everyone got one of these two screenshots: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cc9/21e/341/cc921e3415203f55a2d0b8a5854757a8.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cc9/21e/341/cc921e3415203f55a2d0b8a5854757a8.jpg"><br>  1) Judging by the piece of the desktop with the <strong>Tagruato</strong> logo, the screenshots were taken on their computer. <br>  2) Date 12.18.2007 - just that day on the site TIDOwave.com there was a message that something unexpected had happened in the ‚Äúevent‚Äù and everything did not go as planned. <br><br>  <strong>January 1, 2008.</strong> Update on the TIDOwave.com website: <br>  <em>As many of you know, late last night we returned from our journey.</em>  <em>There are now more rumors than I would like, so I want to clarify what is happening until we are all crazy.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>Yes, we had the correct coordinates.</em>  <em>There is no chance that we were in the wrong place.</em>  <em>But there simply was nothing.</em>  <em>No debris, no leads, nothing.</em>  <em>Just an ocean.</em>  <em>And the calls to our comrades in response were only interferences.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>This does not mean that we give up - exactly the opposite.</em>  <em>Something happened there.</em>  <em>Something too big that even Tagruato with his money will not be able to hush up.</em>  <em>People will want to know what happened to that station.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>And we will find out.</em> <br><br>  <strong>January 2.</strong>  New video on JamieAndTeddy.com: <a href="http://youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DEdTQdriyLNM">youtube.com/watch?v=EdTQdriyLNM</a> <br>  Jamie got drunk and left a new message for Teddy. <br>  <em>OK OK.</em>  <em>I understood everything.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>You are the guardian, and I am the best!</em> <em><br></em>  <em>And whoever your ugly, slutty, ugly</em> <em><br></em>  <em>(drinks)</em> <em><br></em>  <em>The girlfriend you are with is probably a cow from the farm.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>Terrible prostitute.</em>  <em>Unsympathetic.</em>  <em>She is ugly, sure.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>Zadolbalo.</em>  <em>I will not cry for you.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>And guess who the moron is?</em>  <em>Any ideas?</em>  <em>Anyone?</em> <em><br></em>  <em>You!</em> <br><br>  <strong>4 January.</strong>  Update on Tagruato.jp: <br>  <em>There was a skirmish at Chuai Station.</em>  <em>Although the details are not disclosed at this time, rest assured that Tagruato is doing everything to ensure the safety and well-being of the staff and crew.</em>  <em>Teams of professionals who work hard to restore harmony there have been sent to the site.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>At the moment, the investigation into the causes of the problem continues, although there are already suspicions that the eco-terrorist group is responsible for the unrest.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>On our side, high-profile investigators.</em>  <em>Everything will soon be resolved, and all problems will be eliminated.</em>  <em>If you have questions, please contact us by phone + 81-3-5403-6318 for further instructions.</em> <em><br></em> <br>  We already know what the clash happened there, but more on that later. <br>  There is also news about the successful and promising work of the <strong>Hatsui</strong> satellite, which is currently being used as an assistant in the search for a part of the Japanese satellite ChimpanzIII, which allegedly fell from the orbit last week into the Atlantic Ocean. <br><br>  <strong>5 January.</strong>  Update on TIDOwave.com: <br>  <em>DO NOT RETURN to the Farm (obviously - theos headquarters).</em>  <em>She is teeming with agents bought by Tagruato.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>We were set up !!!</em>  <em>All our members know that our goals and motives ‚Äî in the preservation of Mother Earth ‚Äî and NOT in a massacre !!!</em>  <em>Admittedly, we are not upset that Tagruato now has one less "death stations", but we would NEVER kill to achieve our goals.</em>  <em>This is another crime against humanity that Tagruato is trying to shove at innocent people.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>Rest assured: we will not stop until we find our missing brothers and sisters.</em>  <em>We will not stop hoping.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>Wait for an illustration from Janice.</em>  <em>From it you will learn where to meet us.</em>  <em>Cheating Tagruato this time will not go unpunished.</em>  <em>Something happened to our comrades - and from that station - and we will find out - even if we have to get to the very top !!!</em> <em><br></em> <br><br>  <strong>January</strong> 6th <strong>.</strong>  Rob has updated his blog - he is leaving to work in Japan for the company that produces the drink <strong>‚ÄúSlusho!‚Äù</strong> .  This is actually the explanation of everything that begins the film :) <br><br>  <strong>January 7th.</strong>  Reports appeared on YouTube.com from German, Italian and Spanish television with footage of the wreck of the <strong>Chuai</strong> station.  And already on January 8, translations of shocking reports appeared, as well as interviews with the mother of the missing crew member in the NEW French report.  A little later, three more reports appear: Japanese, American, and Russian already known to many: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DmTXQVOs3Kxs">www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTXQVOs3Kxs</a> <br>  Pay attention to the left red platform column during the crash in all videos.  Many claim to have noticed a tentacle there, which is dragging the platform down.  Also during filming from a boat, pay attention to the sound, similar to the roar of a monster already familiar to us. <br>  It is worth noting that in each report information is given in small fragments, which in general allows us to learn the following: <br>  1. Spanish report <br>  From this video we learn that the modern design of the platform is such that under the worst conditions it would stay on the surface for up to 24 hours.  But it is clear that it goes to the bottom in minutes.  The seismographs of the Spanish city of Ribadeo recorded large amplitude oscillations during a catastrophe. <br>  2. German report <br>  The station was designed by Zwichau Engineering in Leipzig under the supervision of a certified engineer, Dominik M√∂ltken. <br>  3. Italian report <br>  Approximately the same information as in previous reports. <br>  4. French report <br>  The families of station workers know little about their well-being.  Source of shooting - unknown. <br>  5. Japanese report <br>  Lost connection with the oil tanker on the route linking Norway and New York.  Official list of the seven missing: Hideaki Sakamoto, Gerhard Ploecker, Tsuneo Matsuhara, Dr.  Paul Nightingale, Donald Carter, Francois Nouvelle, Andy Young-Mun. <br>  6. Russian report <br>  The first direct mention of a possible shootout. <br>  7. American report <br>  Clear shots of shots in the water from the tower.  A dark spot under the surface of the water is taken for the leakage of oil (although the Whistle has already told us that in fact there is no oil). <br><br>  The representative of <strong>Tagruato</strong> said that there were no victims and that the families of the missing were informed.  It also says that the situation is quite complicated and that <strong>TIDOwave</strong> were seen at the scene. <br>  Further, it is said about the oil tanker, the connection with which was lost on the way from Norway to New York (or vice versa).       -    . <br>        - <strong>Tagruato</strong>      : <br><br> <em>  <br>      <br> 2  2008 <br>   ,   , 2  2008 ,   ,       ‚Äî Francois Nouvelle ( ),   Francoise Nouvelle ( ),   .     : <br>    ‚Äî   ,          ,   ,   - . <br>    ,    . <br>   ,     26  27  2007 .    ,     ,       ,         ,   . ,  : Hideaki Sakamoto, Gerhard Ploecker, Tsuneo Matsuhara, Dr. Paul Nightingale, Donald Carter, Francois Nouvelle, Andy Young-Mun.   ,      ,      . <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is information that a few more people could go missing, but it is not confirmed at the moment. At the moment, reports are circulating about the alleged filming with frames of complete destruction of the Drilling Station Chuai. The corporation TAGRUATO did not see these frames and can not comment on them. However, TAGRUATO CORPORATION may confirm the presence of members of the TIDO Wave activist group in the vicinity of the Drilling Station Chuai. TIDOWave is a secret group of extremists who deliberately caused TAGRUATO CORPORATION damage in the past, and several members of which are currently in detention.</font></font></em> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Well, apparently these reports - the first documented evidence of the appearance of our Monstro.
