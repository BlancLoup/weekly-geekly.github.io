The <a href="http://gps-tracker.com.ua/">service</a> itself has undergone many changes, a number of functions have been added that our main competitors do not have.  In general, you are welcome, under the cat (a lot of pictures and the text inside). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Chat with users </h4><br>  Well, here from a technical point of view, there is no particularly great merit.  We just screwed (as for me, excellent service, which no longer needs advertising) to our site, which led to a faster solution to the problems of our users and customers.  Consult our technical support specialists.  Efficiency in solving some issues exceeded even our expectations.  I want to note also the fact that in the presence of a rather ‚Äúactive‚Äù <a href="http://forum.gps-tracker.com.ua/">forum</a> , questions in the ‚Äúchat‚Äù are asked quite often. <br><br><h4>  Determining the location of base stations </h4><br>  An indispensable thing in megacities, or simply closed concrete garages, the essence is to ensure that the device transmits its LAC and Cell ID, which we display on the map automatically translating it into coordinates.  It is extremely unrealistic to calculate the mileage by such coordinates, but to locate the vehicle (area, and sometimes the street), when the GPS antenna is turned off, is easy.  It is also now extremely simple to use any (absolutely any mobile phone with java) as a tracking device (or guard). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/9e73e025/9a05b52b/7b1dfa15/dfbcec65.jpg" alt="determination by base stations"><br><br><h4>  Sms </h4><br>  About sms informing users asked and wrote for a long time.  At the moment, smki are tied to almost any event that can occur with a car, be it speeding or just opening the door.  SMS is not tied to the balance on the device's SIM card, but is tied to the personal account in the system, from which the SMS fee is charged.  This service works in almost all countries of the world where there are mobile operators.  The whole event processing cycle lies on the server side, which means that it is not necessary to be constantly online, when an alarm event (or a programmed action) is received, the SMS itself will inform the operator or the host.  One of the features of working with SMS is that it is possible to assign information from digital sensors by transmitting information from them in a text message (changing the temperature in the refrigerator or changing the level of fuel in the tank).

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/18db41ac/9a56891a/98981ce9/cd9f562f.png"><br><br><h4>  SMS to driver </h4><br>  In the system, a driver or several drivers are tied to each vehicle, but only one is assigned during the flight.  Each driver has a mobile phone, which in turn is tied to his account.  Now the operator (dispatcher) can send messages (about changing the route, for example) directly from the monitoring service, dialing it and send it via the dispatch form.  Further, this function will grow into communication with the driver using a navigator or PDA, but at the moment it is the most convenient way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/6cc6fa3a/7d997365/76223c99/b5f59bba.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Dynamic map </h4><br>  In earlier articles, a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/m2m/blog/111581/">static map</a> was already mentioned <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/m2m/blog/111581/">for insertion into a blog</a> , we went further and made a dynamic map function where the user can transfer information in the form of an iframe about his objects to another person or group of persons.  It is quite convenient when conducting various kinds of competitions or simply dynamically updated maps for relatives who are worried on long journeys.  It is possible to transmit both data on all vehicles, and selectively generating different codes for insertion into the site. <br>  Form of code generation and designation of vehicles: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/e8538d60/8fd16ad6/e705f5d9/01480905.jpg" alt="dynamic map"><br><br>  Actually the map itself in the browser: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/32470e92/16276303/685dd87a/c9ab8ca8.jpg" alt="gps monitoring"><br><br><h4>  Updated chat with device </h4><br>  The function of sending commands has already been implemented in our service, but now it has undergone quite significant changes, which, above all, affected mainly the expansion of functions.  At the moment, a chat with a GPS device is a log in which you can see the last 10 parcels that the server received from the device.  They are reflected in the form in which it comes to the server, and in parsenom, i.e.  in the form in which the string will be written to the database.  The main purpose, in addition to management, is control over sending data from devices, creating macros for controlling (changing a group of commands, etc.). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/504ee3bb/c043a941/43de2876/97d69435.png"><br><br><h4>  Free and commercial use </h4><br>  Service for non-commercial use was, is and remains free.  The concept of ‚Äúnon-commercial use‚Äù implies the use of service by organizations that are non-profitable or socially-oriented: first aid, <a href="http://poiskdetei.ru/">child search programs</a> , public and <a href="http://vomovsks.ru/">youth organizations,</a> or sports-oriented (night competitions or games Dozor, etc.).  Such organizations have access to the service, without any restrictions when officially contacting us.  For non-commercial use were also referred to individuals and businesses that have no more than 5 units of vehicles or other objects connected to the service.  But when large corporations arrive, connecting more than 100 units of transport in dozens of cities, this is a bust.  Therefore, the resource was positioned as free for non-commercial use.  We would be happy to provide services to all for free, but with the growth of service, the cost part increased almost 10 times a month (compared to a year ago), but these are details for another article. <br><br>  The service is developing and currently provides many unique opportunities in various fields of activity.  At the moment, people, cars, horses, dogs, airplanes and small craft "are being monitored", and this proves that our service helps people to live, and read about its new features in the following articles. <br><br>  Stay tuned! <br>  <a href="http://gps-tracker.com.ua/">Regards, Gps-tracker.com.ua</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131177/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131177/</a></p>
