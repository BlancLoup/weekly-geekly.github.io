We are all a bit tired here, but we continue to move around the stands in search of interesting things.  Yesterday, Sony attracted our attention most of all, so the video was appropriate. <br><br><h4>  Sony 3d viewer </h4><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/aq6WCmdIx5Y%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiPJR1zk46u9d8PMvrhZU7Ir6FIyQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Externally, the glasses are not far from the good old virtual reality helmets, but inside they have quite a modern filling. <a name="habracut"></a>

They create the impression that you are sitting in front of a huge screen in a movie theater. And because there are no obstacles (shutter mechanisms or polarizing filters), eyes they don‚Äôt get tired at all, although none of us, of course, spent more than 10-15 minutes down, and maybe fatigue will make itself known later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/588/a2f/3a2/588a2f3a2c0a85dcd3aae67d569a84ba.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The main advantage is the quality of the picture.  Sony glasses and some Carl-Zeiss Cinemizer are just heaven and earth.  Plus, do not forget about the sound - built-in headphones left a pleasant impression. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/223/abd/300/223abd30078f5f26a6222d6b64054a85.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But there are also disadvantages.  First, they cannot work autonomously.  Secondly, they are quite heavy (according to the sensations - 200-300 grams) and not too comfortable to sit on the head.  Do not fall down only because of the included mounting. <br><br>  Now it is difficult to say something more specific, so you have to wait until November, when you can already buy them at the price of $ 800 and protest properly! <br><br><h4>  Sony NEX-7 </h4><br>  Mirrorless Sony, announced just a week ago, immediately lit up at the exhibition - IFA 2011. As we walked past, we decided to check whether the new flagship NEX-7 is as good as they say about it. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/RiXr67Iok_k%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhisNnQBRbW1njO4vPj7R8ItAABSnQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Sony developers finally paid attention to the collective pleas of photographers and added to the camera body all those controls that the first Nexes lacked.  Whole two wheels appeared on the top panel, each of which will help to quickly change a certain shooting parameter (for example, adjust the shutter speed and adjust the exposure).  Also on the top panel there is a nameless button that appears to be programmed (plus two more on the rear panel). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13c/ab2/d66/13cab2d668c6d0c97c1ccf0dfb9ec29d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The wheels are comfortable, their thumb is very easy to reach, the stroke is smooth.  Also, there was a long-awaited built-in flash, which is emitted after pressing a separate button on the rear panel.  And once there was a flash, then there was a place for the ‚Äúhot shoe‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6dd/d41/693/6ddd4169399a59448026adcadc287f03.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Another important innovation is the built-in electronic viewfinder with a resolution of 1024x768 pixels.  The eyecup sticking out of the back panel looks strange and unusual, but the viewfinder is surprisingly comfortable in operation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/76db1db2/78374606/4b209e3f/cbaa05cc.jpg"><br><br>  In the hands of the camera is good, but not to call it compact with all the desire, will not work, especially with the "whale" lens.  Plus, the NEX-7 weighs pretty well.  Also, the resolution of the matrix looks very controversial - here the APS-C sensor is already installed at 24 megapixels.  But autofocus works very well and the camera is notable for high speed of continuous shooting - 10 frames per second.  In short, my first impressions of the new product are positive.  Frightens unless the preliminary price tag.  40 000 rubles is somehow very pitiful, even for such an advanced mirror. <br><br><h4>  PS Vita </h4><br>  Many people probably know what PS Vita is, but since I had a chance to look at it alive, I‚Äôm not too lazy to repeat it. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/vyn9wlbdyOQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjgsVetIbtnb3i8cF3QE1vQDkK8xQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Approaching the stand with the consoles, we asked the consultants about what is inside the processor, how much memory the gadget, and so on, to which they replied, saying it is still unknown, they know only 4 cores.  But if you look in the Internet, you can dig out that the Vita is equipped with a quad-core Cortex-A9 processor and SGX543MP4 + graphics.  There is reason for joy: the amount of RAM remains decent and is 512 MB. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e5d/e46/bbe/e5de46bbe18570d573e6d1a67673fb35.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The display at the console OLED, five-inch and touch, with a resolution of 960 √ó 544 pixels.  Everything else on the front panel seems to be familiar :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/acd/fb9/78a/acdfb978a7389c432b2de895a1b2cb93.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The back panel is also touch.  Whether it is convenient and whether it is necessary at all - time will tell and a long test. <br><br>  Sony earlier stated that the launch of the console will take place at the end of 2011, but now these dates have been postponed to February-March 2012. For Europe, the Vita version with only Wi-Fi onboard is estimated at ‚Ç¨ 250, and the version with a 3G modem will cost about ‚Ç¨ 300 <br><br><h4>  Toshiba Z830 </h4><br><br>  Almost everyone who is at least somehow interested in laptops has one word in mind now - ultrabooks.  At the IFA 2011 we found the thinnest and lightest representative of this class. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/v_QDS_WoGXQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhj4weRK6bLphAyyHlDNlH0uTr7qCg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  It would seem: Acer S3, Lenovo U300s - bright representatives of ultrabooks and where it is thinner and lighter?  Toshiba Portege Z830 puts them, if not on the shoulder blades, then certainly makes them stagger. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/28b/af3/5f4/28baf35f427135c09824236cb9a2b715.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  While all are passionate about aluminum, Toshiba made the Z830 magnesium body.  It is not clear how much stronger it is than aluminum competitors, but it feels pleasant to the touch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/103/4a0/65e/1034a065ee3efb32bf79dc0efaf34b64.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There is a minimum of glossy details: glitters, and even then not much, only the display. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ebb/11f/11c/ebb11f11c0af932dfd3484feda98a834.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The keys are already familiar to you island type.  The touchpad, with indicators under the buttons, may be familiar from other Portege notebooks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/150/38e/0bc/15038e0bcadba8f62e4e4f343f7d0260.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  What was surprising was the number of connectors.  There are two USB 2.0, one 3.0, HDMI, network port, card reader and even a VGA connector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/440/ba8/d26/440ba8d26710a7e83e5924f4045ec83b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And the most interesting thing: the thickness of the laptop case is 15.9 mm, weight - 1.14 kg.  About the cost so far, alas, one can only guess.  No matter how much we tortured Toshiba‚Äôs representatives, they didn‚Äôt even give us an approximate price.  They said that you need to wait a bit. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127678/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127678/</a></p>
