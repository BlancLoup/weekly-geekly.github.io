This year we decided to change the trajectory a bit and give a voice to the community.  The trajectory was changed, and <b>25 speakers</b> will speak in a community track in two days.  These are people involved in completely different projects from completely different companies from different countries, but all of them are united in what they say about real experience and the conference participants will have the opportunity to ask around those who are familiar with this or that technology or solution in the fields.  Under the cut - the details of what will be discussed in the track.  Since <a href="http://msdevcon.ru/">there</a> will be a broadcast on <a href="http://msdevcon.ru/">DevCon</a> and then recordings, all this unique content will be available - <b>don't miss it!</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When I formed the program and talked to the speakers, I tried to minimally change the way in which the narrative will take place.  Therefore, expect hardcore in some places, a lot of Open Source and real experience :) Trying to pick up relevant topics, I involuntarily got an intersection with the main program in the topics (which is inevitable, of course), but the tuning of presentations allowed me to align the topics with the stories about how real projects, pitfalls, etc. were made. In some reports, it somehow turned out that there is practically no mention of Microsoft.

      So, in the community track you will hear about several main topics: <br><br>  <b>Project management:</b> <br><ul><li>  <b>Alexey Losev</b> will talk about how to build the development process in order to do what is needed, </li><li>  <b>Igor Shcheglovitov</b> from Kaspersky Lab will show how to analyze key performance counters and not die in the process, </li><li>  <b>Andrey Akinshin</b> will talk about the benchmark performance, which he maintenit and which Hanselman recently wrote as great to use </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Microservices and containers.</b>  Since the topic is hot, then reports decently. <br><br><ul><li>  A report on Continuous Delivery for microservice projects will be made known in the community by <b>Martin Kulov</b> , </li><li>  <b>Eugene Agafonov</b> from ABBYY will talk about how to use the whole thing to the developer and what it means for him </li><li>  <b>Vladimir Turovtsev</b> from Logrocon, Microsoft‚Äôs gold partner and well-known ALM experts, will show in half an hour how to build Continuous Integration in a company in 72 hours, </li><li>  <b>Yuri Krutilin</b> , DevExpress, will give a talk about real-world experience in automating mobile device testing, </li><li>  <b>Bernardin Katich</b> will show how to do Scrum in large projects </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Internet of things.</b>  Rich in reports topic. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Alexander Surkov</b> will talk about .NET Microframework (we haven't seen this topic for a long time!), </li><li>  <b>Katalin Gheorghiu</b> - about using PowerBI for visualization tasks in IoT projects (in fact, this is not a report, but a series of demonstrations), </li><li>  <b>Sergey Grebnov</b> will show a super demo with AllJoyn, bots, TV and cloud services, </li><li>  <b>Alexey Lyubko</b> will show you how to build a really useful IoT project - a cloud brewery. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Web development.</b>  One of the most difficult issues for me is that you can tell people that it would be interesting enough and not told many times already?  Found <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Denis Ivanov</b> from 2GIS - how to build simple and scalable backends </li><li>  <b>Denis Cvetzich</b> , Trend Technologies, with a specific, but very interesting report on how to grasp the immense in the world of MVVM frameworks </li><li>  <b>Novak Istvan</b> will tell about the latest (May freshness!) Changes in Angular 2, showing the most delicious, </li><li>  <b>Adam Granich</b> will show how to create web projects using reactive programming, F # and WebSharper. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Cloud.</b>  About the cloud, we have already told a lot and in detail.  This time they focused on real stories. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Alexander Laisha</b> , EPAM's Chief Development Engineer, will tell you how to migrate the project to the Azure Cloud Service in the Azure Service Fabric, retell, but not intersect with his report, a story about building a global solution for the Connected Car on Anton Fabric Troyanov from BrightBox. </li><li>  <b>Gleb Foresters</b> from DodoPiztsy will share how the information system is done behind a network of pizzerias around the world, </li><li>  <b>Alexey Korotaev</b> , Odin, with an interesting report about the review of the security model of Azure Active Directory - all authentication in the cloud now works on this! </li><li>  <b>Marcin Borecki</b> , MVP, about the new Azure Functions service, with which you can build a pipeline action with inputs, outputs, and performing intermediate actions in the cloud </li></ul><br><br>  And a few more reports that are not included in the above topics, but I found it criminal not to talk about them: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Dmitry Kostylev</b> , Kaspersky Lab, about how to destroy database performance in 30 minutes.  Best practices from a leading expert :) </li><li>  <b>Martin Krchek</b> , marketing director of Madfinger Games (gamers will understand), about how to develop games that will bring income </li><li>  <b>Peter Lyapin</b> from WavePoint will give an introduction to how to develop Office Add-Ins - cross-platform modules embedded in office applications that offer various functions for the user. </li><li>  <b>Tatyana Kuznetsova</b> from DevExpress - about user interaction in VR / AR, about prerequisites, cause and effect :) </li></ul><br><br><br><hr><br><br><h3>  DevCon 2016 </h3><br>  <a href="http://www.msdevcon.ru/">DevCon</a> is the largest Microsoft conference for developers in Russia.
