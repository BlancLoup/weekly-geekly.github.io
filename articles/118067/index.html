  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview of systems for doing home accounting</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When selecting programs for review, an important requirement for me is the lack of synchronization with any external service (yes, I'm paranoid) and the availability of a version for iPhone.  Comparison table <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/pub%3Fhl%3Den_US%26hl%3Den_US%26key%3D0ApPNFHwOSfl6dHFjeHFEd3hnX2tkaENNWDR6OVA0RkE%26single%3Dtrue%26gid%3D0%26output%3Dhtml">prosharna Gugldoksah</a> . <br><br>  Unless otherwise specified, ‚Äúiphone‚Äù refers to all iOS devices.  I tried to give comments on each program on the merits and for those items that are not reflected in the comparative table.  If an asterisk is in the table field, then there are comments to this value in the review. <br><br>  The general point - those programs that update the exchange rate automatically, do it with <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/">finance.yahoo.com</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Criteria Description </h4>  Here are some of the criteria listed in the document. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

      <br>
    <h6>  Import and export data </h6>  All the formats found in the table are quite common. <br>  <strong>CSV (comma separated values)</strong> - here and so everything is clear.  Data is listed in rows.  Inside a line, items are separated by a comma (or other character).  This format is read by Excel and many other programs. <br>  <strong>OFX (open financial exchange)</strong> is the most common format for exchanging financial information.  The majority of Internet banking can export data to it.  Alpha Bank and Citibank too. <br>  <strong>QFX</strong> is a proprietary variant of OFX.  Used exclusively by <a href="http://www.intuit.com/">Intuit</a> in their <a href="http://quicken.intuit.com/">Quicken</a> financial collection application. <br>  <strong>QIF (quicken interchange format)</strong> is an open format that appeared before OFX and is not supported since 2006. <br>  <strong>MT940 (message type)</strong> is a message format introduced by SWIFT for exchanging information about accounts.  Used by banks around the world. <br><br><h6>  Server installation </h6>  Item for megaparanoikov.  If you do not want to share your financial data with service staff, and you need access from all devices at least in the apartment, then install the service on your server. <br><br><h6>  Account Support </h6>  Ability to create many, many accounts (&gt; 1).  Under the account refers to all sorts of options for storing money: bank cards, savings accounts, cash ... <br><br><h6>  Types of accounts </h6>  Cash, current accounts, credit accounts / cards, debts.  I was especially interested in the ‚Äúdebts‚Äù clause, since not everyone has implemented it, and the clause is very important in our harsh reality. <br><br><h6>  Recipients </h6>  The ability to enter payment recipients: companies or people.  It can be used in the formation of statistics, such as "how much I spent on the purchase of pencils in ikei." <br><br><h6>  Ability to recognize checks </h6>  Personally, this function would be very useful to me.  Those expenses that we pay in cash, sometimes just too lazy to make manually.  This function was not detected in any application. <br><br><h6>  The ability to attach files </h6>  As a replacement for the previous function: made the costs, attached scan scan.  You can save the invoice in the mail. <br><br><h6>  Currency support </h6>  The ability to specify for each account and transaction its own currency. <br><br><h6>  Profile Support </h6>  The ability to specify who owns the account: me or my dog.  It is necessary if the budget is conducted for several people. <br><br><h6>  Invoices </h6>  Invoice - a document provided by the seller to the buyer, which specifies the characteristics of the goods, as well as the delivery time and amount to be paid.  According to Wikipedia, an analogue in the Russian Federation is an invoice.  Obviously, this is only necessary for people who are going to trade something. <br><br><h6>  Budget planning </h6>  Setting a limit for expenses, and receiving messages when this limit is reached. <br><br><h6>  Nested transactions </h6>  For a nested transaction, you can break the amount into categories or simply by name (as in a regular store receipt). <br><br><h6>  Rules for automatic transaction processing </h6>  This feature resembles the filters in the mailbox.  For example, if the name contains ‚ÄúInternet‚Äù, then the recipient must be set to ‚ÄúMegatelecom‚Äù. <br><br><h6>  Filters for statistics </h6>  Receipt of a report filtered by various criteria: time, categories of payments, etc. <br><br><h4>  Testing </h4>  In order to collect more or less complete information about the application, I tried to do the following manipulations with each one.  For each application I tried to create categories: <br><br>  -salary, <br>  -entertainment, <br>  --cinema, <br>  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî 4D, <br>  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî 5D, <br>  ‚Äî‚Äî slot machines, <br>  ‚ÄîRegular payments <br>  ‚Äî‚ÄîInternet (1000 rubles per month) <br>  ‚Äî‚Äî mobile phone (as used), <br>  ‚Äî‚ÄîZHKH (the amount is not the same every month). <br><br>  For the ‚ÄúInternet‚Äù item there was an attempt to establish a monthly automatic charge-off with a payment reminder.  For "utilities" just a reminder every month. <br><br>  There was an attempt to have two profiles: me and my dog ‚Äã‚Äã(let's call it Martin).  For the first one, we have ‚Äúcash‚Äù and ‚Äúcredit card‚Äù accounts (in dollars).  For the second, there is a ‚Äúbig bank account‚Äù (in euros) and ‚Äúdebts‚Äù (where does the dog come from?).  Accordingly, there was an attempt to make several transactions, including transfers between accounts.  Next, display the statistics with different parameters. <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://www.quantumquinn.com/overview/daybank/station">Day bank station</a> </h5><br><img align="left" src="http://pix.am/d4CG.png">  Just so you can not start to use, you must first be sure to synchronize with iPhone / iPod.  The process is not entirely trivial, since it is necessary first to select a device with a separate button, and then with another button, ‚Äúsynchronize‚Äù.  And while on the iPhone should be open tab with synchronization.  The interface of the mobile application itself leaves much to be desired, which is only one pop-up menu. <br><br>  Inconvenient switching between accounts and categories (using the drop-down menu).  When you try to delete a pre-installed category or account, the application crashes.  On a mobile application, it turned out to be done.  As it turned out, on the desktop application, you can only drive in new transactions, the rest of the functionality is rendered on the iPhone. <br><br>  Account types are not supported in the usual sense, you can create different groups (for example, "cash" and "credit cards").  The currency automatically clings to the iPhone, apparently from the localization settings, and does not change further.  Reminder of the next payment can be set only for recurring transactions.  Statistics can be viewed only in text mode and filtered only by categories and months, for the year will not work.  I was pleased with the opportunity to do the calculations directly in the input field.  The search works only on the iPhone, but according to my queries (obviously relevant to the transaction) no results. <br><br>  In general, a very negative impression of both the desktop version and the mobile application. <br> <a href=""><img alt="If you see this text, the picture did not load." src="http://pix.am/rE36s.png"></a> <a href=""><img alt="If you see this, then the picture is not loaded" src="http://pix.am/P8Khs.png"></a> <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://www.iggsoftware.com/ibank/index.php">iBank</a> </h5><br><img align="left" src="http://pix.am/Rec0.png">  Very sophisticated application with different nice but not always necessary buns. <br>  When creating an account, it offers to link it to a bank with further integration with Internet banking.  But, as we have already found out, this is not relevant for our village.  For different types of accounts, you can specify specific characteristics.  For example, for a credit card - the interest rate, for debts - the name of the borrower, the number of payments, the interest rate, the number of payments, etc. In general, almost all parameters are taken into account. <br><br>  Profiles are not supported as such, but you can create a group for accantes and thus designate who owns which accounts.  Recipient / payer management is implemented on one side only: if you enter an existing recipient in the appropriate field, the program will automatically assume what and how much money was spent.  You cannot view the list, rename and somehow integrate with the address book the list of recipients. <br><br>  Printing and searching are fully supported.  Statistics are also very handy with all sorts of buns. <br>  Also in the program there are all sorts of bells and whistles for people involved in all sorts of financial transactions.  For example, playing the stock exchange. <br><br>  After an hour of active use, almost 100% of the CPU began to eat (the laptop almost took off), although it had normally hung up inactive for 24 hours. <br> <a href=""><img src="http://pix.am/nGXGs.png"></a> <a href=""><img src="http://pix.am/kZg0s.png"></a> <a href=""><img src="http://pix.am/CDyOs.png"></a> <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://www.lyricapps.com/">iCompta</a> </h5><br><img align="left" src="http://pix.am/d1pG.png">  The site says that the mobile version costs ‚Ç¨ 3.99.  In aytyunz Store $ 4.99.  Do not be embarrassed - currencies are different.  For dekstopnuyu on the website want ‚Ç¨ 14.99, and in the ITUns Store - $ 18.99. <br><br>  When you create an account, you can manually specify the data for automatic downloading of statements from Internet banking.  But I couldn‚Äôt check, as those internet banking I use either load everything with Java or do not generate an OFX statement.  You can link several cards to one account.  Debts in the program are not implemented. <br><br>  Nested categories are supported, but implemented as groups of categories, that is, transactions cannot be assigned to a group, but you can assign a category (which is not a group). <br><br>  Currencies are supported only at the account level. <br><br>  Filters for statistics by time, but not by category. <br> <a href=""><img src="http://pix.am/zzHzs.png"></a> <a href=""><img src="http://pix.am/ypWGs.png"></a> <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://www.syniumsoftware.com/ifinance/">iFinance</a> </h5><br><img align="left" src="http://pix.am/c5Pb.png">  It supports a lot of languages, among them there are Russian and even Chinese.  In the Russian eppstore is in first place in the financial applications.  When you first start very useful tips. <br><br>  Accounts can be grouped into folders, as well as in iBank.  There are no account types as such; you can only set the parameters of the bank to which the account is linked.  The concept of debt does not exist either. <br><br>  Recipients are maintained at the most primitive level, it is necessary to drive in each time with handles. <br><br>  Only able to export to CSV or its own ifi3a format, which can be used when transferring from one system to another. <br> <a href=""><img src="http://pix.am/LIOzs.png"></a> <a href=""><img src="http://pix.am/yEGUs.png"></a> <a href=""><img src="http://pix.am/ANKEs.png"></a> <br><br><h5>  <a href="https://ironmoney.com/mac/">Iron money</a> </h5><br><img align="left" src="http://pix.am/AFx0.png">  A simple application (compared to analogues) with a set of necessary functions and a minimalist interface. <br><br>  Requires obligatory registration on IronMoney.com.  Accordingly, synchronization through their website.  There is an API. <br><br>  I did not manage to find the demo version, so the comparative characteristics of this program are based only on the information that is on the developers site. <br><br>  You can also keep a budget on their website, which is completely free.  There is no password protection per se, but the application is tied to a specific account, so this is a kind of protection. <br><br>  All screenshots can be viewed on the <a href="https://ironmoney.com/mac/">website of</a> developers. <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://www.jumsoft.com/money/">Money 3</a> </h5><br><img align="left" src="http://pix.am/CxY6.png">  This project is a logical continuation of Money 2, and then, in turn, will be followed by Money 4 with new buns.  For an upgrade with Money 2, they want $ 19. <br><br>  I used this application for a long time, and I liked it.  The only thing that grieved me there was that there was no such thing as ‚Äúdebts‚Äù, so certain difficulties arose.  There is a Russian localization. <br><br>  It supports the so-called ‚Äúsmart accounts‚Äù, which can display transactions from several accounts according to the rules created by the user.  Each account can be protected by a separate password. <br><br>  Nested categories are supported only up to the second level. <br><br>  The program also has a set of functions for economically advanced users: invoices (and a catalog of goods to them), investments, stock reports. <br><br>  Statistics can be filtered by time, category, account, and create your own rules. <br><br>  The version for <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/jumsoft-money/id325934225%3Fmt%3D8">iOS 3 is</a> free, and for <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/money-for-iphone-your-sweetest/id433858534%3Fmt%3D8">iOS 4 it is</a> already $ 1.99 (without the version for the iPad). <br><br>  You can now download <a href="http://www.jumsoft.com/money4/">Money 4 (beta)</a> from the official site with a very nice and user-friendly interface.  In addition, there appeared such a useful function as attaching files to transactions. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.jumsoft.com/">Jumsoft</a> has an educational discount of 20% on all products (I <a href="http://www.jumsoft.com/">‚Äôm</a> interested to tell you how to get it in HP). <br> <a href=""><img src="http://pix.am/kb0Us.png"></a> <a href=""><img src="http://pix.am/FIG5s.png"></a> <a href=""><img src="http://pix.am/oLfEs.png"></a> <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://moneydance.com/mac">Moneydance</a> </h5><br><img align="left" src="http://pix.am/LZab.png">  There are versions for all platforms, as written in Java.  There is unconfirmed information that the project was abandoned.  Not very convenient and nice interface.  After deleting 20 categories one by one (with deletion confirmed!) I want to strangle the developers. <br><br>  It is able to export in addition to QIF to its own formats, as well as to files with tabs as a separator. <br><br>  The program believes that Russia and the ruble, respectively, does not exist.  In general, it has a rather limited set of currencies. <br><br>  The set of functions is standard, but the management is inconvenient. <br> <a href=""><img src="http://pix.am/oqW6s.png"></a> <a href=""><img src="http://pix.am/HFOzs.png"></a> <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://nothirst.com/moneywell/">Moneywell</a> </h5><br><img align="left" src="http://pix.am/PqCT.png">  You can sync with multiple iOS devices.  The site is written about synchronization with the iPad, but there is no version for it in the iTunes Store.  The license for one user per application is $ 49.99, and the family one is $ 79.99. <br><br>  Instead of categories and budgets, the developers decided to implement ‚Äúbaskets‚Äù, an analogue of envelopes in which people used to put money to pay for electricity, an apartment, a car, etc. The idea is similar to <a href="http://www.kraynov.com/2008/06/23/4-envelopes-2_0/">4 Kraynov envelopes</a> , but in this case cash flows are limited and time and by category. <br><br>  You can not set the initial capital for accounts. <br><br>  Because of the implementation of the ‚Äúbaskets‚Äù, each of them needs to set a limit on the costs or replenish it, otherwise a minus will be displayed in the reports. <br> <a href=""><img src="http://pix.am/PkGzs.png"></a> <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://www.catamount.com/desktopApps.php">PocketMoney</a> </h5><br><img align="left" src="http://pix.am/ECgT.png">  It can sync with multiple iOS devices and with android phones.  Backup requires <a href="http://syncdocs.sourceforge.net/">SyncDocs</a> . <br><br>  A very inconvenient program to manage, a feeling that the design is generally from three (at least) different people. <br><br>  Photos can be attached to transactions (for example, check scans). <br><br>  When trying to make a transfer from one account to another, there were glitches with the exchange rate.  Despite the fact that the course automatically clings (or is set by pens, if desired), the absolute value of the transfer was the same on both accounts (clearly visible on the screenshot). <br><br>  The budget can be set as restrictions for individual categories (as in MoneyWell). <br><br>  Statistics only text. <br> <a href=""><img src="http://pix.am/zTO5s.png"></a> <a href=""><img src="http://pix.am/bK8Us.png"></a> <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://www.splashdata.com/splashmoney/">SplashMoney</a> </h5><br><img align="left" src="http://pix.am/ySnG.png">  The program does not allow to start work without synchronization with an iPhone, the version for which costs $ 4.99.  Therefore, the data (as in the case of Iron Money) about the program are taken from the developers site. <br><br>  Judging by the screenshots of the program, there is some kind of child interface with shiny icons.  Allegedly, you can upload your own icons. <br><br>  There are versions for all iOS devices, as well as for androidophones, Blackberry, Windows Mobile, and Palm OS.  With all mobile devices can be synchronized.  A simple license for the probe-based application does not allow synchronization with mobile devices, it is necessary to buy one of the mobile versions.  If you already have a desktop version for Palm OS, you can <a href="http://www.splashdata.com/splashmoney/buy/iphone.htm">get</a> free code for iPhone, Windows Mobile or Blackberry.  The version for the iPad is purchased separately. <br><br>  Currency rate updates for iPhone and iPod only. <br><br>  In general, despite the repulsive appearance, the program has the necessary set of functions for doing home bookkeeping. <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://www.squirrelapp.com/">Squirrel</a> </h5><br><img align="left" src="http://pix.am/n9qe.png">  Version under Windows do not want to do under the pretext that the latter does not support the technologies that the application uses.  After the launch, it became clear why.  The program is spinning and spinning, all possible 3D gadgets.  All this, apparently, is reserved for the ‚Äúinterfaces of the future‚Äù, although this is clearly excessive. <br><br>  Immediately after starting and creating the first account, it became periodically to throw out the error ‚ÄúItems cannot be deleted from transactions‚Äù, apparently due to the fact that when I started, I deleted the default category (although why did it let me do it at all?).  Categories can be managed only from the settings (before you have to guess). <br><br>  You can create folders (pseudo-profiles) and smart folders based on the rules (as in Money 3).  After creating the folder, I didn‚Äôt manage to delete it. <br><br>  There is no automatic data reading in banking, although you can connect to them via the built-in browser and import the necessary data from there. <br><br>  You can calculate the amount directly in the input field (you must put the = sign). <br><br>  Able to predict based on available statistics. <br><br>  If you turn off the whistles and fakes, it is quite a nice and convenient programmulina. <br> <a href=""><img src="http://pix.am/Ctp6s.png"></a> <a href=""><img src="http://pix.am/HeWTs.png"></a> <br><br><h4>  Some more applications </h4>  <a href="http://martin.davidssons.com/cs193e/balance.html">Balance</a> is a very simple application without an iPhone client. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.maxprog.com/site/software/personal-finance/icash_sheet_us.php">iCash</a> - application without a client for iPhone.  Extremely clumsy and awkward interface.  The developers seem to have decided that someone else would like their unique idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbudget management. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.fadingred.com/koku/">Koku</a> (former <a href="http://www.fadingred.com/cashbox/">Cashbox</a> ) - without a client for iPhone.  When buying Koku, you can use the <i>Cashbox</i> promo code and get a discount of $ 5. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.midnightapps.com/">Cha-Ching</a> - merged with the <a href="http://www.intuit.com/">Intuit</a> project, suggest either to use <a href="http://quicken.intuit.com/personal-finance-software/mac-personal-financial-software.jsp">Quicken</a> or <a href="http://mint.com/">Mint</a> .  <a href="http://quicken.intuit.com/personal-finance-software/mac-personal-financial-software.jsp">Quicken</a> has only a desktop version, it costs $ 49.99, but there seem to be a few third-party clients for iPhone, including from Mint.com.  <a href="http://mint.com/">Mint is</a> cool, no doubt, when connecting, you need to select a bank, but since there are no Russian banks in the list, it is impossible to go further than the first registration step. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4>  I decided to stay on Money 3 (more precisely 4), I got used to it, and the new version is very cool. <br><br>  A little about the rating: I used to pay attention to it, because "thousands of lemmings can not be wrong."  But then I realized that in some cases he was incorrect regarding his own feelings about using the program.  Usually when I buy an application (if there is no light version), I read reviews first of all, if this is not enough, I go on the Internet and read reviews and reviews there.  And, in the end, you can buy an app for a box just to protest. <br><br><hr>  All rights to the logos belong to the respective companies. <hr><br>  PS I'm surprised by some designers and interface developers under Mac OS.  They consider the use of standard controls (buttons, fonts, etc.) to be a mauveton, although these standard elements are more than digestible.  In an attempt to create their beautiful, they give birth to something that I want to immediately close and never open again.  Under Windows, by the way, the same story. <br><br>  <b>UPD.</b>  <b>A few words about how to select applications for the review.</b> <br>  The lack of synchronization with an external service (Iron Money leaked) and the presence of an iOS client I have already voiced. <br>  Next, I looked through the first 100 applications by rating both in eppstore and in ITUns stor.  Another Google search for "mac os home budget" and similar. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118067/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118067/</a></p>
