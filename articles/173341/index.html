Also there you can find ideas for a service that could bring joy to all people on Earth. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Wildfire </h4><br>  It was not by chance that I began my review with <a href="http://www.wildfireapp.com/">Wildfire</a> .  The fact is that relatively recently it was <a href="http://blog.wildfireapp.com/2012/07/31/wildfire-is-joining-google/">bought</a> by Google.  And while Google pulls tires with Wildfire <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/map_of_the_week/2013/03/google_reader_joins_graveyard_of_dead_google_products.html">closing</a> , I want to have time to write a review about it.  So, the service was purchased for <a href="http://9to5google.com/2012/07/31/google-buys-social-media-firm-wildfire-for-a-reported-250m/">$ 250M</a> along with <s>serfs</s> , employees, patents, and <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2012/08/01/mark-zuckerbergs-sister-now-works-for-google/">Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs sister</a> .  Let's look under the hood of this service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c58/3c9/5ba/c583c95bac43f08ac442f6a3ecb057db.jpg"><br><br>  Judging from the picture on the main page of the site and other text, it can be concluded that Wildfire provides a single interface for managing and monitoring your accounts in six social networks at once.  Is it really?  Looking ahead to say - no, it is not.  Wildfire Messages allows you to post only in three of them (Facebook, Twitter, Google+), and not through a single interface, but with a separate form for each network.  Wildfire Monitor compares the metrics of only two social networks (Facebook and Twitter).  Again, without a "single interface."  And Wildfire Analyitcs works with one Facebook at all, but with a single interface :)

      <b>Wildfire Ads.</b>  A very interesting tool for creating and managing advertising companies.  Provides the ability to create many options for banners by combining images and texts.  Familiar marketers confirm that it is cool and significantly improves the efficiency of the company.  Of course, the product allows you to target impressions.  At the moment, targeting is available for such metrics as age, gender, location and interests (the most delicious in my opinion). <br><br>  <b>Wildfire Pages.</b>  This is such a CMS for fan pages on Facebook.  The product can create fan pages using a set of standard templates.  If desired, templates can be customized, add new tabs.  All templates provide a responsive design, so there will be no problems with mobile phones.  It is also possible to target the page content according to parameters such as language, gender and geographic location of the visitor. <br><br>  <b>Wildfire Messages.</b>  A tool for creating, monitoring and managing messages.  Allows you to set up postponed schedule posting.  Upset the actual lack of a "single interface".  For each social network has its own form of communication.  I think at least the block of the schedule could be made general. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b95/3b3/579/b953b3579de3a607546a002f29a00ad2.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Wildfire Analytics.</b>  There is nothing interesting here: standard analytics on Facebook Fan Pages. <br><br>  <b>Wildfire Monitor.</b>  Here is a little more interesting: you can <a href="https://monitor.wildfireapp.com/comparisons/777850/fans_followers/coca-cola-vs-pepsi-on-facebook-and-cocacola-vs-pepsi-on-twitter%3F%3Dundefined">compare the</a> metrics of several brands (Facebook fan pages or Twitter accounts). <br><br>  <i><b>Total:</b> <a href="http://www.wildfireapp.com/">Wildfire is</a> definitely one of the market leaders.</i>  <i>It provides full functionality for promoting brands in various social networks.</i> <br><br><h4>  Hootsuite </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a43/894/f47/a43894f4760535a2a3b089ebd2dbc635.jpg"><br>  The killer feature of HootSuite is uniquely the <a href="http://hootsuite.com/app-directory">HootSuite App Directory</a> .  This is a collection of extensions and applications that HootSuite users can add to their control panel.  These applications are created and maintained by third-party developers and companies that extend the ecosystem of social content of the HootSuite control panel.  At the moment, the collection has 5 paid and almost fifty free applications (among which there are including RSS Reader :) <br><br>  Also I want to separately mention the <a href="http://hootsuite.com/features/custom-analytics">integration with Twitter</a> .  HootSuite is a <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/programs/twitter-certified-products/hootsuite">certified partner of</a> Twitter, which gives a number of advantages over competitors.  In addition to posting a schedule, HootSuite provides the ability to track tweets by keywords and @ mentions.  This functionality is really very useful for marketing research. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9d3/bab/d64/9d3babd64fba3e7efea4bcc2b65ff44a.jpg"><br>  <a href="">(big size)</a> <br><br>  Of course, the service provides full integration with Facebook: this is a posting on a schedule with the subsequent collection of various metrics.  And detailed analytics on fan pages and their audience.  And of course, branded streams that can contain your private messages, posts from the wall and from the news, as well as public posts from the search. <br><br>  HootSuite functionality does not end there.  He also knows how to integrate well with <a href="http://hootsuite.com/linkedin">LinkedIn</a> , <a href="http://hootsuite.com/google%2B">Google+</a> , Foursquare, Myspace, Wordpress, Mixi and do not forget about the <a href="http://hootsuite.com/app-directory">HootSuite App Directory</a> !  But something special to note the integration with these services is difficult. <br><br>  <i><b>Total:</b> <a href="http://hootsuite.com/">HootSuite</a> is one of the most powerful tools in social marketing, which not only provides full integration with countless social networks, but also has a number of unique features.</i> <br><br><h4>  Tweetdeck </h4><br>  <a href="http://tweetdeck.com/">TweetDeck</a> is a free cross-platform application designed to work with social networks. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5ab/850/483/5ab8504836ae4cee1543a21a9c5d0cf4.jpg"><br>  <a href="">(big size)</a> <br><br>  Despite its name and the status of the official client for Twitter, TweetDeck implements integration even with Facebook (and sometime with MySpace, LinkedIn, Google Buzz and Foursquare).  TweetDeck has a very similar multichannel column interface with HootSuite, which also supports all sorts of filters, including arbitrary keywords.  There is also support for displaying videos from YouTube and images from Flickr.  But the analyst is virtually absent here. <br><br>  <i><b>Total:</b> <a href="http://tweetdeck.com/">TweetDeck</a> is a handy tool for managing and tracking posts on Twitter, Twitter, Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, LinkedIn.</i> <br><br><h4>  Appdata </h4><br>  The service allows you to monitor metrics for <a href="http://www.appdata.com/">applications</a> and <a href="http://pagedata.appdata.com/">fan pages</a> on Facebook. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4b4/5e8/78c/4b45e878cee21a60b1d9200dc26c2be2.png"><br>  For applications, there are essentially two metrics available: MAU and DAU (monthly &amp; daily active users).  Adding, multiplying, <s>integrating and extrapolating</s> them, AppData builds a dozen tables and graphs.  It is possible to <a href="http://www.appdata.com/compare/apps%3Futf8%3D%25E2%259C%2593%26compare_type%3Dapplications%26facebook_apps%255B%255D%3DFarmVille%2B2%26facebook_apps%255B%255D%3DDiamond%2BDash%26facebook_apps%255B%255D%3D%26facebook_apps%255B%255D%3D%26facebook_apps%255B%255D%3D%26commit%3DCompare%2B%2521">compare several applications</a> .  AppData also provides aggregated information on application developers: how many developer applications are in the top 10-100-500, as well as the total DAU and MAU of all its applications.  For applications it is offered to watch data for the last two weeks for free.  For only <a href="http://appdata.com/pricing">$ 6000 annualy,</a> you can save the history of changes in metrics and export them. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2fb/ed6/075/2fbed60753e821f37bc21d2f5944ad52.png"><br>  For fan pages, metrics are provided significantly more.  You can compare several pages only by two baselines: Likes and People Talking About This.  And for a single page there is also a breakdown of the audience by country-gender-age, as well as a good analyst of fan page posts. <br><br>  <i><b>Total:</b> <a href="http://www.appdata.com/">AppData</a> uses the standard Facebook Graph API and does not provide any unique tools.</i>  <i>It can be used to familiarize yourself with market leaders rather than continuously monitoring and analyzing data for your applications.</i> <br><br><h4>  Klout </h4><br>  <a href="http://klout.com/">Klout</a> is a company that works in the field of social link analysis and is engaged in measuring the degree of user influence in social networks.  Analytics are based on data from social networks like Twitter, Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, Foursquare, YouTube, Instagram, Tumblr, Blogger, WordPress, Last.fm and Flickr.  Klout-rating is a number from 1 to 100. According to the developers themselves, the rating is calculated based on more than 400 metrics and is updated daily.  Basically, the rating is influenced by the size of the personal network, the amount of content published and how other users interact with etymy publications. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/427/4dd/2c6/4274dd2c68dda857dc660679b84b4cbf.png"><br>  Klout forms a rather interesting model of interaction between brands and users: the higher your rating is, the more bonuses and benefits (perks) you get from brands, businesses offline and on the Internet.  Especially if the user has some thematic specialization.  After all, an influential user who has received a discount from the brand becomes loyal to him.  He is likely to write in his blog that he bought an iPhone for a third of the price (or he received it for nothing) and all of his five thousand loyal readers, for whom he has credibility, will thereby receive his share of free Apple ads.  I think that such a strategy can be many times more effective than traditional advertising.  Moreover, according to the principle ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt look a gift horse in the mouth,‚Äù the recipient of the discount has less psychological incentives to criticize the product.  Potentially, Klout, as it develops and covers a wider range of mainstream social networks, could become a universal scale measuring popularity in the world of the Internet. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2f7/b50/dce/2f7b50dce80aa191b046882b42267e2b.jpg"><br>  I want to add that Klout even has its own API.  The whole API essentially comes down to getting the rating of any user by their ID in Klout itself, on Twitter or on Google+. <br><br>  <i><b>Total:</b> <a href="http://klout.com/">Klout</a> is a universal measure of human popularity (or rather, even a blogger).</i>  <i>People with high Klout-rated can have a tangible impact on brand image.</i> <br><br><h4>  What is missing for the joy of all people on Earth? </h4><br>  There are countless different services that use the word social in the most bizarre combinations: <br><blockquote>  <a href="http://www.socialbakers.com/">Socialbakers</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.socialbro.com/">SocialBro</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.howsociable.com/">HowSociable</a> <br>  <a href="http://socialmention.com/">SocialMention</a> </blockquote><br>  And I search more without this word: <br><blockquote>  <a href="http://crowdbooster.com/">Crowdbooster</a> <br>  <a href="http://webtrends.com/">Webtrends</a> <br>  <a href="http://tweetreach.com/">Tweetreach</a> <br>  <a href="http://twittercounter.com/">Twitter counter</a> <br>  <a href="http://technorati.com/">Technorati</a> <br>  <a href="http://topsy.com/">Topsy</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.icerocket.com/">Icerocket</a> <br>  <a href="http://bufferapp.com/">Buffer</a> <br>  <a href="http://meople.net/">Meople</a> </blockquote><br>  Then what is missing for the joy of all people on Earth?  I believe that there is a very lack of service that would focus on <b>users</b> , and not on monitoring and <b>brand</b> management.  Such a service could, for example, give advice on setting a user's privacy ( <a href="https://www.privacyfix.com/">there is a good initiative</a> ).  You can also analyze the user's posts and comments for obscene expressions and offer to clean up the foul language.  In general, this is a service that would allow combing our social accounts. <br><br>  <b>UPDATE</b> <br>  Thank you <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/mokshinv/" class="user_link">mokshinv</a> , who in his <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/173341/">comments</a> shared a <a href="http://www.crm2web.ru/news/9769/">link</a> to the review of services for monitoring social media of Runet. <br><br>  <b>UPDATE 2</b> <br>  Together with a colleague <a href="http://www.dataart.ru/blog/2013/04/instrumentyi-monitoringa-v-sotsialnyih-setyah/">published an</a> extended version of this review. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/173341/">https://habr.com/ru/post/173341/</a></p>
