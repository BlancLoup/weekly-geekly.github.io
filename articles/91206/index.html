  <section class="page js-page"><h1>You can carry a mobile phone in your pocket!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A week and a half ago, I asked the habra people to ask questions about the radiation of mobile phones ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/7days/blog/">this post</a> ), because I was the leading roundtable on the problems of electromagnetic radiation.  The round table was successfully held, following the results of the discussion I made a video, but, since not everything was included in it, I decided to write another post. <br><br>  Here is the video, there are answers to key questions (Habr insider!), This is cutting.  In general, the round table lasted several hours and ended with a debate. <br><br><video>  http://rutube.ru/tracks/3146911.html?v=f74958f1fc4b92ad43f5c39fdf0b5b13 </video>

      Under the cut - my somewhat chaotic notes, a summary of what was discussed at the round table.  Recorded directly at the table on the podium :) <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The main thing that they said right away: electromagnetic fields are HARMFUL types of radiation.  Mobile communication works with the use of electromagnetic fields and, in theory, should be normalized.  It is obvious that now the majority of ‚Äúnon-professionals‚Äù are in conditions typical for the conditions of professional study.  In general, all those who work with EMR, are prof.med.  selection, annually - physical, their health under the supervision of doctors continuously. <br><br>  Now the circle of those who are considered "professionals" is not outlined.  According to the law, if more than 50% of the work time of a person works under the influence of a harmful factor, it should be referred to as "pest" (a funny medical term).  It was proposed to introduce the profession of "user of cell phones" :) <br><br>  History reference <br>  The first studies began in the 50s, people with radar equipment started having health problems, had occupational diseases, which gave an impetus to the start of research. <br>  The second stage - the end of the 60s and the beginning of the 70s, when powerful radar centers appeared.  Then hygienic standards were developed, together with the Americans a commission was created, the purpose of which was to develop common standards.  San. Norms were issued in the 2000s, but they are based on the program that was in the mid-80s, i.e.  does not take into account the specifics of cell phones.  By 2005, it was planned to completely replace the hygienic standardization, but so far this has not happened. <br>  Another interesting point: it turns out, the gap in san.normas between the United States and Russia is gigantic, two orders of magnitude, and mobile phones are manufactured in accordance with American standards.  "Their" radiation standards "our" do not match, we are much tougher.  So, in Russia for the population the radiation standard is 10 microwat per square cm, in the USA - 1000, and it was recently reduced from 10,000. <br><br>  Over time, the development of diseases that have been observed among "professionals" is possible.  This is the position of the World Health Organization: a press conference was held two years ago in Berlin, where the following data was published: in Europe, 10% of the population attributed the deterioration of health to cellular communication.  In our country, such statistics are not yet available, but appeals to doctors are increasing, according to similar indications.  The main thing is to establish an objective relationship between cellular communication and health.  There are a lot of health complaints that may be connected with cellular networks in Russia, but they are not studied.  There is even such a notion of ‚Äúsituational stress‚Äù a possible factor in the deterioration of health, but a person cannot measure and sense it. <br><br>  The most large-scale and well-built experiments were held in the center of Burnazyan in 1997, they should be repeated now, but the equipment for research was lost due to the transition from analogue to digital equipment.  No one wants to finance such studies.  Moreover, those studies were published, but for some reason there is little about them on the RuNet.  The experiments were carried out in real time, with the involvement of volunteers, used cell phones allowed to use.  Then the effect of changes in the bioelectrical activity of the brain was recorded.  It turned out that the human body begins to react 30 seconds after turning on the cell phone.  Observations continued up to half an hour with each volunteer, using both analog standard (NMT) and digital telephones (CDMA, GSM).  The experiment was repeated, repeated, during the month the experiments were repeated several times.  It turned out that the body reacts differently to each of the standards.  It was also proved that with a single exposure recovery occurs, but the question - what happens to chronic use, is still open. <br><br>  Abroad allocated huge money by the governments of various countries, there are centers in Sweden, England, Germany, Canada, Italy, France, Japan, China.  In Russia, only a small group of scientists in the Burnazyan center and several scientists in other institutions of the country are engaged in these issues. <br><br>  In total in the world at the moment 33 works related to the study of EMR of cellular phones have been released.  However, as all the speakers said, the significance of such experiments is close to zero: they were all carried out with a single irradiating effect. <br><br>  In addition, all studies were conducted on adults (of course!), And it is children who are most at risk.  When children grow up, they have a unique vulnerability.  As for the studies of the influence of cellular networks on children's health, there were only two works (in Germany), but during the experiments there was not even a control group.  We, in Russia, have been conducting research at the lyc√©e in Khimki for four years now, scientists are studying the change in cognitive functions, and they constantly conduct surveys among children. <br><br>  Most scientists believe that the overuse of a mobile phone by a child can lead to deviations in the functions of higher nervous activity, partly proven in observations in the city of Khimki.  In addition, children have a thinner bone, there is a large dose to the brain, and absorption is completely different from that of an adult.  In addition to problems with the nervous system and deterioration of cognitive functions, there is such a complex disease as a salivary gland tumor, which is almost not treated.  Also, except for children, in the risk zone and the category of radio-sensitive people who need to move everyone somewhere to a desert island, because the waves in the city will find them everywhere. <br><br>  With regard to the impact on sexual activity, most scientists are inclined to think that when you carry a phone in your pocket, nothing terrible happens, radiation does not have a big effect on the genitals.  Although in Norway two years ago the work was discussed, where major changes were described, but for some reason our scientists subjected it to harsh criticism.  They say sperm are restored :) <br><br>  Here on this optimistic note I finish :) <br><br>  PS if someone has a problem with Rutube and doesn‚Äôt see the video - you can see it on the Nomobile.ru website <a href="http://www.nomobile.ru/video/70081.html">here</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/91206/">https://habr.com/ru/post/91206/</a></p>
