  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bitcoin creator search</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The founding <a href="http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">document</a> with the principles of the peer-to-peer cryptosystem Bitcoin was published by a certain Satoshi Nakamoto.  It is still not known who is hiding behind a pseudonym, one or several people. <br><br>  The Japanese name Satoshi <a href="http://www.names-meanings.net/name/satoshi">means</a> "clear thinking, quick-witted, wise."  The word <i>naka is</i> translated as ‚Äúinside‚Äù, and <i>moto</i> means ‚Äúbeginning, basis, basis, organization‚Äù.  That is, Satoshi Nakamoto can be translated as "a clear-minded person inside a fundamental organization."  An interesting coincidence, given the revolutionary essence of the Bitcoin payment system, which threatens to overturn the global financial system. <br><br>  American journalists in recent days published two investigations at once ( <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/10/10/111010fa_fact_davis">1</a> , <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1785445/crypto-currency-mystery">2</a> ), putting forward different versions of the identity of the creator of Bitcoin.  One of these versions (with the Russian trace) looks very plausible.  However, first things first. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Security experts, who unsuccessfully examined Bitcoin source code for vulnerabilities, concluded that the developer of the program is ‚Äúa world-class programmer with deep knowledge of C ++ and an extensive background in the field of cryptography, economics and P2P systems‚Äù.

      Linguistic analysis of all online messages on behalf of Satoshi Nakamoto (‚âà80 thousand words on the forums and in the letters of distribution) <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/10/10/111010fa_fact_davis">showed</a> that this person is fluent in English, writes in a bright and clear style and makes very few typos.  In the very first message, he used American English, but after that he completely switched to classical spelling using words like <i>color</i> instead of <i>color</i> , <i>gray</i> instead of <i>gray</i> and so on, decorating texts with refined phrases like <i>bloody hard</i> . <br><br>  The author of the first study decided that the author of the work is really British.  In search of truth, he went to the Crypto 2011 cryptographic conference in Santa Barbara, where he found a suitable candidate - 23-year-old Irish cryptologist Michael Clear.  He uses the same English grammar and is a co-author of scientific work on P2P-systems.  However, the Irishman <a href="http://www.irishcentral.com/news/Irish-cryptologist-denies-he-created-bitcoin-the-internet-currency-code-131130853.html">categorically denies</a> his involvement in the creation of Bitcoin, and other parts of the puzzle do not add up.  This version really looks rather weak. <br><br>  Professor of journalism and professional linguist Adam Penenberg of New York University conducted another investigation and achieved better results.  In his opinion, the Bitcoin developer deliberately uses British disguise to impede the linguistic analysis of his texts, that is, he possesses an extraordinary intelligence and knows how to remove his tracks. <br><br>  The journalist tried to isolate specific phrases and google them.  People tend to repeat and even the smartest person can sometimes use the same phrase twice, and once under his real name.  This is especially true of technical terms and formulations, where the stereotyped statements are particularly high. <br><br>  For several months, Adam Penenberg studied the texts of Satoshi Nakamoto and checked his specific phrases.  In the end, the journalist was lucky - he found that a specific combination of words [computationally impractical to reverse] is found on the Internet only 26 times, mostly copies of the same document.  But there is another document with the same combination of words.  This is U.S. Patent Application No. 20100042841 <a href="http://www.freshpatents.com/-dt20100218ptan20100042841.php">Updating And Distributing Encryption Keys</a> , published on February 18, 2010.  This application describes a cryptographic system, largely based on the same principles as Bitcoin technology.  The attention of the researcher attracted one fact.  The patent application was filed on August 15, 2008, and the domain bitcoin.org was registered on August 18, 2008 ‚Äî another coincidence. <br><br>  The authors of the patent application list three people - Neal King (Neal King), Charles Bry (Charles Bry) and Vladimir Oksman (Vladimir Oksman).  Further investigation allowed the alleged identification of these people.  All of them are authors of several more patents close to Bitcoin technology. <br><br>  Neil King and Charles Bray are residents of Munich (Germany), and Vladimir Oksman may be a programmer of Russian origin, Vladimir [Vova] Oksman, who lives in New Jersey and works for Samsung ( <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/voksman">LinkedIn</a> profiles, <a href="http://oksman-vladimir.moikrug.ru/">My Circle</a> ). <br><br>  Two months before the launch of Bitcoin.org, these three registered another patent application, which also speaks for itself: <a href="http://www.patents.com/us-20090296924.html">Key Management For Communication Networks</a> . <br><br>  Neil King fits best under the linguistic and psychological portrait of Satoshi Nakamoto.  Judging by his <a href="">Facebook profile</a> , he is a very educated and fantastically well-read person, he left reviews for 46 books on Amazon, including astronomy, biology, cryptography, linguistics, literature, mathematics, philosophy and physics.  Moreover, these reviews are written in an excellent literary style, very clean, without a single superfluous word and typos, just like Satoshi Nakamoto.  His social network wall is filled with reports of protests against Wall Street, criticism of the banking system and the Patriot Act (a law passed in the United States in October 2001, which gives the government and police broad powers to oversee citizens). <br><br>  However, all three refute their involvement in the creation of Bitcoin, in response to the corresponding request, they gave different comments.  Vladimir Oksman limited himself to one phrase ‚ÄúWrong person‚Äù, and Neil King said in his lengthy letter that he had never heard of Bitcoin at all and had to study an article in Wikipedia. <br><br>  A cryptologist who hasn‚Äôt heard about Bitcoin is about the same as a journalist who doesn‚Äôt know about Twitter, Adam Penenberg said, and recalls several examples of how many well-known writers and inventors published their works anonymously and initially denied the fact of authorship. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130248/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130248/</a></p>
