Typically, the site was given a phone number, in the best cases, the toll free number is 8-800.  But times change, the competition becomes higher, and even though the quality of services and goods is getting better, the demands on them are constantly growing. <br><br>  We are demanding because  We believe that we deserve it, but we are not spoiled for the same reason - we deserve a royal appeal!  Therefore, we are raising the bar and offering not just a telecom service in the form of a quick call, we offer our customers a customer retention service! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/466/342/d05/466342d05a134134a6fb50fb9ad70c02.jpg" alt="image">

      This article focuses on such a small marketing tool as a callback button and what lies behind it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Perception makes a sale </h2><br>  We already wrote that, as a rule, <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/17990/">98% of users leave your site</a> without ordering anything.  We can assume that these were not themed visitors, and they were not going to buy anything.  However, an experienced sales manager will tell you that there are no non-thematic visitors and if a person has looked into your store, then you already have a chance to sell him something. <br><br>  What influences the fact of the purchase?  I call it ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù (to have a feeling, a feeling, an emotion, an impression, a perception - depending on the context). <br><br>  The fact is that people tend to make even unnecessary purchases if they have a ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù.  Remember, did you buy a thing in the mall so long ago because you just liked it, and not because you needed it? <br><br>  In addition, the client can independently, get acquainted with the properties of the proposed product in the windows, through labels, prices, price tags, websites, etc. When talking about the properties of the product, the buyer assesses it in terms of the emotions that he will receive using this product / product / service. <br><br>  It is the question "How?" - the main question at the time of the decision.  How I will use it, how easy it is and how (for the better) my business, life, health, relationships, etc. will change.  Therefore, it is important to create the right perception, and every detail, both in the ofline store and in online sales, matters. <br><br><h2>  <a href="http://www.pozvonim.com/">Widget</a> - he is a person! </h2><br>  Once on one of the sites for the sale of real estate, I wanted to leave a request.  Almost filling out the form, I had to spend some time trying to figure out how to remove the button with the phone, which was stuck in the last required field.  The callback button was not removed at all, and therefore the form was not sent. <br><br>  You do not need to be a pro to argue that such a quick call implementation will reduce and not increase the conversion.  Therefore, externally identical buttons behave quite differently, the whole secret lies in the algorithms determining the behavior of the button on the site.  <a href="http://www.pozvonim.com/">A working callback button is</a> like a talented sales manager - he knows at what point you need to remain silent and which one to make an offer. <br><br>  Appearance is equally important.  Adaptive design of the widget to your site, complements the ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù of your client.  Harmoniously fitting into the design of your site, the widget looks like a part of it, created to facilitate the communication of the client with you, and not an obsessive aggressive picture. <br><br>  In world practice, there are many examples of companies that have managed to increase online sales by changing their emotionality on the site.  For example, the free mailing service MailChip, after redesign, has increased 140 times in 4 years.  By making a more user-friendly design, they managed to increase their customer base by more than 600% per year.  Of course, not only one design had such an impact, but you should not write off its merit. <br><br>  Things like personal preferences, cultural differences, gender and upbringing influence the perception of color by a particular person.  Therefore, in our panel, you can change the color of forms, lines, buttons, text, change text and images, in general, make such a widget that is ideal for the tone and overall style of your online store. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/757/eea/c08/757eeac082f14f84ac753db852d6401f.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>!</i>  <i>Choosing a widget, remember that its appearance can improve the user's mood, or vice versa - cause anxiety.</i> <br><h2>  Analyze to improve perception </h2><br>  The benefits of <a href="http://www.pozvonim.com/">customer retention service</a> do not end with being connected to a customer in 28 seconds or less. <br><br>  Call Analytics - allows you to assess the quality of the work of your managers.  This is no less important aspect, since it is the quality of the work of managers that ultimately determines the sale.  The growing competition and glut of the market led to the emergence of a new type of customer - ‚ÄúFormed consumer‚Äù.  In addition to the high requirements for the product, it has equally high requirements for the sales process itself.  One of the leading purchase motives for the client is comfortable communication with the seller.  Even a consumer interested in buying will most likely go away if the seller behaves indifferently or is excluded, even though answering his questions.  At the same time, if the seller constantly speaks, without even trying to listen to the client and understand his needs, the client will also be dissatisfied. <br><br>  The customer retention service determines whether an optimal balance has been reached in communication between the customer and the manager for each call.  And the ability to listen to the recording of the conversation allows you to identify errors in practice and raise the level of your (their) manager (s). <br><br><h2>  Leave opportunities by fulfilling promises </h2><br>  How many times have you left your contact information in the form of feedback?  As a rule, after this, you read the automatic ‚ÄúThank you for writing to us.  We will contact you shortly".  Did you feel at that moment, the confidence that they would call you?  Did you have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhen this is coming soon? <br>  <a href="http://www.pozvonim.com/">The customer retention service</a> will not allow the manager to forget that the customer wants to talk to him.  If a call order occurs during off-hours, then in the morning the widget will necessarily call back both the client and the manager.  The company collects phone numbers of potential customers during off-hours, the customer gets confidence that he will be called back. <br><br>  No phone number will be lost, except for calls, the service sends SMS with the client's phone number to the manager's number. <br><br>  If there is still no such information in your online store, such a useful sales assistant, like our widget, we invite you <a href="http://www.pozvonim.com/">to come in and try to work with it for free!</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293612/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293612/</a></p>
