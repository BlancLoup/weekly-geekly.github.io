And it's not about that.  For several months now we have seen how links from exchanges and external factors of search engine optimization as a whole lose their effectiveness in promoting young projects for Yandex.  And it is very happy. <br><br>  <b>Engaging in website promotion becomes more difficult, but much more interesting.</b>  <b>And soon it will become a really piece product, with an individual approach.</b> <br><br>  This is indicated by <a href="http://www.searchengines.ru/articles/009490.html">Yandex</a> itself and <a href="http://xn--e1ajlebheeh8h.xn--p1ai/">experts</a> in the field of website promotion.

      ‚ÄúYoung‚Äù is not those whose domains are less than six months.  These are sites without a ‚Äúhistory‚Äù: accumulated statistics for specific web documents, with a small age of pages, a number of useful links to these documents, and others. <br><br>  For us, it was somewhat incomprehensible why the old projects, which strenuously moved for the huge budgets thrown away to buy links, still remain in high positions, and for new projects this no longer works. <br><br>  We came to the conclusion that this is a temporary harmony, which is due to the fact that search engines constantly introduced new filters in response to actions that are not greedy for streamlined optimization of specialists.  And if now apply the new law for all projects, in the issue will begin chaos. <br><br>  Then we ourselves tried to answer the question when it would work for everyone without exception and quickly found the answer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Companies that invest good money in their websites not only develop more dynamically as enterprises under the new market conditions, but reflect these changes in their websites in a timely manner.  After all, I want to not only successfully attract a visitor, but also to keep him, to increase the conversion. <br><br>  For 1.5-2 years, the company itself and the base on which a modern web resource is built is changing.  This leads to the fact that the company understands the need for complete processing of its site.  So, it receives a ‚Äúyoung‚Äù site, which often has to be developed almost from scratch. <br><br>  The conclusion is unequivocal: within two years, most of the sites will be processed, and fresh projects will be able to receive their target visitors on a par with the "pumped" colleagues. <br><br>  PS But it‚Äôs too early to bury links from exchanges.  Rather, the exchanges themselves will change. <br><br>  PPS You can answer the question, which links are currently working, this way: the notion of a link is returned, as recommended by the webmaster.  Therefore, if the link is useful for the visitor, noticeable and there are transitions on it - it will work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118821/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118821/</a></p>
