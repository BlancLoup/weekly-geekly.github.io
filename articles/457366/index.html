According <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sponsored/article/popularity-of-gaming">to</a> Reuters news agency, the game industry last year brought in more revenue than television, movies, and music.  While other forms of entertainment are experiencing a decline (for example, TV -8%), sales in the gaming sector grew by 10.7%.  The largest growth is observed in the Chinese market, where game sales grew by 14%. <br><br>  The dominance of games is manifested in a change in the relationship between igrodelyami, Hollywood and publishers.  Previously, games were created on the basis of popular books and films.  Now it is often the opposite.  Example - Angry Birds and Assassin's Creed, released as films many years after the appearance of these legendary games.

      Video games have already ceased to be a "home" activity, becoming a spectacular sport.  Overwatch and StarCraft II, CS GO made eSports a global phenomenon (yes, we remember the quake, the line, warcraft and DotA).  At competitions, players can earn more than $ 1 million in prize money! <br><br>  The future of games looks brilliant, and the gaming capabilities of augmented and virtual reality will grow thanks to the reviews and reviews of the first test users.  So we can expect that there will soon be a consistently high demand for high-power graphics and microprocessors. <br><br><h2>  What about gamers? </h2><br>  Changes in the gaming industry have affected gamers.  Newzoo, an analyst of the gaming and e-sports market, has been researching people who can be called gamers for a whole year.  It turned out 8 main types of fans of video games. <br><br>  You need to understand that the data below is relevant primarily for the US market.  In Russia there will be other numbers, and gender variation will be different.  Moreover, in other countries, women sometimes <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/what-country-has-the-most-gamer-girls">play more often than</a> men.  So, what are gamers, how do they differ from each other?  We tell. <br><br><h3>  Fanatic (13% - the proportion of the segment of the total number of gamers) </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0m/hr/p3/0mhrp3g8nyykmqlh6rephgdxvfi.jpeg"><br><br>  He literally lives and breathes games: he looks at the games, plays himself.  He tries to be in the subject of all events in Igromir and eSports, buys new items.  He has enough money to spend on his hobby.  Actively invested in computer hardware and peripherals.  No one will be surprised if he calls a pet in honor of the legendary orc or another game character. <br><br><ul><li>  Middle age: 28 years </li><li>  Hobbies in order of importance: games, electronics, movies </li><li>  Gender: 65% are men, 35% are women </li><li>  Family: married or single, have children </li></ul><br><h3>  Active player (9%) </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cj/yc/ee/cjyceetbgkoz2atzp5qgskx5okm.jpeg"><br><br>  An avid gamer who plays games many hours a week.  He is not as passionate about this activity as a fanatic, but games are an important part of his life.  As a rule, he fully works, so the purchase of new games and "hardware" is quite within his power.  Enjoys playing on a good technique, watching interesting streams and other video content.  Balanced spending your money and time on games. <br><br><ul><li>  Middle age: 28 years </li><li>  Hobbies in order of importance: games, movies, music </li><li>  Gender: 65% - men, 35% - women </li><li>  Family: married or single, have children </li></ul><br><h3>  Traditional gamer (4%) </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d4/kn/zb/d4knzbnaxqo2yxfoifkai7zvfhs.jpeg"><br><br>  Actively played about 10 years ago, when there was no e-sports and video content.  Therefore, does not like to watch the game of other people, it is better to play yourself.  Fortunately, there are a large number of favorite games.  Enjoy tracking the latest gaming industry news and trying out interesting new items.  Nothing can stop him from indulging his little whims, so the purchase of new equipment and peripherals is an integral part of his leisure. <br><br><ul><li>  Average age: 32 years </li><li>  Hobbies in order of importance: games, movies, music </li><li>  Gender: 62% - men, 38% - women </li><li>  Family: married or single, have children </li></ul><br><h3>  Zhelezyachnik (9%) </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ms/b5/hg/msb5hgb0ni4p5rh8xklj0osfe_w.jpeg"><br><br>  Quietly related to games, and in a week can play only a couple of times.  However, closely following the news from the world of computer equipment.  It is important for him to get maximum pleasure during the game.  Everything has to ‚Äúfly‚Äù, so the hardware company does not spare money for the latest gaming gadgets, peripherals, ‚Äúhardware‚Äù.  Computer for $ 5000?  Easy!  Zhelezyachnik's love for computers, electronics and gadgets, as a rule, goes far beyond games. <br><br><ul><li>  Average age: 31 years </li><li>  Hobbies in order of importance: movies, music, travel and entertainment </li><li>  Gender: 60% - men, 40% - women </li><li>  Family: married or single, have children </li></ul><br><h3>  Player Viewer (13%) </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ek/ma/u3/ekmau3n7wf2t0fj4a0zqivgiobg.jpeg"><br><br>  It can spend not so much time on games, but with pleasure it watches streams, letspley and other gaming video content alone or with friends.  The process of the game itself does not cause much interest, it is the pleasure of watching the video.  He spends a lot of time in front of the TV, on YouTube, Twitch and other popular platforms for gamers. <br><br><ul><li>  Average age: 31 years </li><li>  Hobbies in order of importance: music, movies, travel and entertainment </li><li>  Gender: 54% - men, 46% - women </li><li>  Family: married or lonely, have children / lives with parents </li></ul><br><h3>  Observer (6%) </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rm/nx/wf/rmnxwfj4kacrcpgc5_ednsmg1fu.jpeg"><br><br>  Often watching video content or broadcasting gaming competitions on YouTube or Twitch, but almost does not play games.  As a rule, this is a former gamer who once loved to play, but because of work or family circumstances, abandoned this business.  He does not have the right equipment or just play time.  There are those who just like to watch the game of professionals.  Just like football fans watch matches of their favorite teams. <br><br><ul><li>  Average age: 33 years </li><li>  Hobbies in order of importance: music, movies, sports </li><li>  Gender: 57% - men, 43% - women </li><li>  Family: married or single, have children </li></ul><br><h3>  Time killer (27%) </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8v/xg/b4/8vxgb4rvhaxlp4bc0iw8d-qul7u.jpeg"><br><br>  Cybersport and video game interest him weakly.  Such a gamer rarely spends the game more than three or four hours a week, so he does not consider games an important part of his life.  They need them only to pass the time.  Hence the interest in simple and fast games: Candy crush, Clash of clans, etc.  Computer games are not at all interesting to him, as well as "hardware". <br><br><ul><li>  Middle age: 37 years </li><li>  Hobbies in order of importance: movies, music, travel and entertainment </li><li>  Gender: 39% are men, 61% are women </li><li>  Family: married or single, have children </li></ul><br><h3>  Cloud gamer (19%) </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cf/zc/zg/cfzczgygsalerjzp7jj3z5xj1-8.jpeg"><br><br>  He likes video games, but is indifferent to the power of his "iron".  It rarely spends money on it, preferring to dispense with what it is.  Can use <a href="https://www.cloud4y.ru/cloud-hosting/cloud-server/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Darticle">cloud services</a> for games.  He buys equipment only in case of emergency or receives computer / console devices as a gift. <br><br><ul><li>  Middle age: 30 years </li><li>  Hobbies in order of importance: games, music, movies </li><li>  Gender: 59% - men, 41% - women </li><li>  Family: married or single, have children </li></ul><br>  To find out what type of gamers you are, <a href="https://newzoo.com/insights/quizzes/what-type-of-game-enthusiast-are-you/">take the quiz</a> on the Newzoo website.  Also there you can find the <a href="https://resources.newzoo.com/hubfs/Newzoo_Gamer_Segmentation.pdf">full version of the</a> study. <br><br><h2>  What does all of this mean? </h2><br>  This study shows how strong a bundle among gamers has occurred in recent years.  New directions appeared, and gamers got the opportunity to play new games even on the old device.  Cyber ‚Äã‚Äãcompetitions are gaining more and more popularity, and a lot of people are watching the game of popular bloggers who are ready to donate for interesting video content. <br><br>  Note that for domestic gamers such segmentation is not quite suitable.  We have other habits and hobbies.  But what kind of psycho gamers exist in Russia is hard to say.  There are no serious studies in this direction.  We can recall an interesting <a href="https://corp.mail.ru/media/files/igrovoj-rynok-v-rossiimail.ru-group2012.pdf">study of the</a> Russian gaming market from Mail.ru, but it was carried out in 2012, ages ago (by the standards of the igromir).  It would be interesting to see what has changed by 2019. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/457366/">https://habr.com/ru/post/457366/</a></p>
