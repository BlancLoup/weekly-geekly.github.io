We invited several interesting Western speakers to the Forum.  We will tell a lot about what for the first time, you are waiting for live demonstrations and master classes.  In this post I would like to introduce you to the topics that will be raised this time, and with our speakers. <br><br>  Ask questions in the comments - the speakers still have time to take them into account in their presentations.  And prepare questions for the Forum, we love and appreciate them very much.  Participation is free, but the number of places is limited, <a href="http://techforum.mail.ru/%3Fhabrahabr1">registration is</a> required and will close soon. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/df4/6e1/120/df46e1120d129a34076fefc14b13e8fb.jpg" align="left">  <b>Maxim BABICH</b> , Head of the Money Mail.Ru project development department, will tell you how Mail.Ru Money is arranged inside, how to make such a system scalable and fault-tolerant, and what problems are not typical for other high-load services. <br><br>  Especially this knowledge will be useful to those who develop projects related to e-commerce (including payment aggregators, billing systems, etc.). <br><br>  <a href="http://money.mail.ru/">Money Mail.Ru</a> is a payment system that currently processes hundreds of thousands of transactions per day.  Previously, almost no information was published about the Money.Ru device.  Over the past year, this service has grown very seriously and has become stronger.  If you are interested in any specific aspects of the construction of a payment system, please write in the comments - we will try to touch on these topics in the report. <br><br><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f46/29f/856/f4629f8567dac92ace2f98c8b04c6dc1.jpg" align="left">  <b>Denis ANIKIN</b> , Technical Director of Mail.Ru Mail, will make a report on the experience of launching HTTPS in Mail.Ru Mail.  The well-known HTTP traffic encryption technology used in browsers and servers for more than 15 years has been fully used relatively recently on busy global projects and services.  In these questions - a lot of subtleties associated with setting up SSL / nginx, adaptation and twisting the server software.  Denis will gladly share all this information in his report. <br><br>  Denis knows many technological intricacies and is responsible for the work of the fourth in the world in terms of attendance of the postal service. <br><br>  At the last Technology Forum, Denis talked about how <a href="http://techforum.mail.ru/report/7">Mail.Ru withstand high loads</a> . <br><br><br clear="all"><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/265/050/5d4/2650505d4fca4b83c9553810b3abfae1.jpg">  <b>Alexey MASHANOV</b> , the leading programmer of the social network My World, will tell you how to centrally collect logs from a cluster in almost real time.  This problem is relevant even for a small group of servers working on the same task, what to do when there are hundreds or thousands of servers?  For this, there are a number of finished products, and Alexey will tell you why the Scribe log server was chosen from among them. <br><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scribe_(log_server)">Scribe</a> is a real-time log aggregator developed by Facebook and transmitted to Open Source in 2008. <br><br>  Alexey has been working at Mail.Ru Group since 2010, he is engaged in optimization, statistics, and improvement of the technical processes of the social network ‚ÄúMy World‚Äù. <br><br><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f4c/338/0b4/f4c3380b46e16cbf4af4a2a2567979c6.jpg" align="left">  <b>Boris WOLFSON</b> - Technical Director of HeadHunter.  His report at the Technology Forum will focus on the balance between quality and efficiency of the release of new features.  The need to maintain this balance is in front of each development manager.  Boris in his report will share the systematic approach adopted in Headhunter. <br><br>  Ward Cunningham coined the term ‚ÄúTechnical Debt‚Äù ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">wiki</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/119490/">habrahabr</a> ) for this situation.  According to this metaphor, a quick and careless addition of functionality leads us to a technical debt, which the inventor of the wiki technology compares with a financial debt.  Many teams, increasing technical debt, fall into the ‚Äúdebt hole‚Äù and eventually slow down the speed of their work.  Boris will tell why and in what situations technical debt appears and how it can be purposefully reduced.  This report will be of particular interest to technical managers. <br><br><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/447/05f/865/44705f865db594209276b74020bdcc09.jpg" align="left">  <b>Pavlo BARON</b> , leading architect of the German consulting company <a href="http://www.codecentric.de/">Codecentric</a> , will talk about how to build distributed systems to work with large amounts of data.  Pavlo often speaks at IT conferences around the world and is the author of three books: Erlang / OTP, Pragmatic IT Architecture and Fragile Agile.  The report itself will be related to Big Data, but on the sidelines, Pavlo will be happy to share his knowledge and experience in other issues, where he is a recognized expert - Erlang / OTP, Agile, Java. <br><br>  Pavlo will speak in English, we will provide simultaneous translation.  Along the way, it turned out that our speaker has old Ukrainian roots, and he is slightly familiar with Russian.  So it is possible that the audience and Pavlo will begin to understand each other much faster than is usually the case with the participation of a translator. <br><br><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c71/25d/4f2/c7125d4f2301cf0cb9c6733afbcc2792.jpg" align="left">  <b>Alexey VOROPAEV</b> , the head of the project ranking department for Mail.Ru Search, will reveal the topic of machine learning: what it is, how it works, and whether it can be applied in your projects.  Alexey will talk about popular machine learning algorithms with and without a teacher, and will also show examples of their use (including in the Mail.Ru Search project). <br><br>  Before becoming the head of the ranking department, Alexey was engaged in the development of a search server and an indexer.  Prior to Mail.Ru Group, Alexey worked on a distributed enterprise-level traffic analyzer at <a href="http://perimetrix.ru/">Perimetrix</a> . <br><br>  The report will be especially useful for programmers and analysts who deal with large amounts of data. <br><br><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/55a/0d8/3b3/55a0d83b39bef4463cbdd1c6d3cdaa33.jpg" align="left">  <b>Sergi MANSILLA</b> , lead developer at <a href="http://ajax.org/">Ajax.org</a> , will give a talk on ‚ÄúArchitecting Node.js JavaScript for Large-Scale Projects‚Äù. <br><br>  Cergy is a recognized JavaScript expert and leads the <a href="https://c9.io/">Cloud9 IDE</a> development team in Amsterdam, one of the most well-known online Node.js development environments. <br><br>  Prior to this, Sergy worked as a senior developer at <a href="http://www.tomtom.com/">TomTom</a> , where he led a team involved in building a JavaScript framework for user interfaces. <br><br><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c07/80e/9f2/c0780e9f263ecf6c91b47c30da31a570.jpg" align="left">  <b>Victor STARODUB</b> , Mail.Ru Mail programmer, will tell you about the experience in implementing the IMAP protocol in the server part of Mail. <br><br>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMAP">The IMAP protocol</a> replaced <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/POP3">POP3</a> twenty years ago, but despite this, it is a "tough nut to crack" for large mail services.  First of all, because the number of mail clients, multiplied by the complexity of the standard, makes it necessary to take into account many exceptions in the logic of the server.  Secondly, the IMAP principle itself implies a permanent connection between the client and the server, unlike session POP3.  In the case of millions of connections per hour, this feature becomes a problem.  Victor will tell about solutions of this and other problems in his report. <br><br><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f4/338/704/1f4338704ec9cc46946bf214ffcfc73b.jpg" align="left">  <b>Luka Garrulli</b> , CEO of <a href="http://www.nuvolabase.com/site/">NuvolaBase Ltd</a> , will talk about how to create a fault-tolerant replicable cluster database, which allows for easy scaling only by adding new nodes to the cluster. <br><br>  Luca is the author of the <a href="http://www.orientdb.org/orient-db.htm">OrientDB</a> DBMS, a graphical, document-oriented database of the NoSQL class, 100% implemented in Java.  It supports an object-oriented database interface that runs on top of a document-oriented layer.  Implemented a powerful query language based on SQL, cluster architecture, master-master replication, full support for ACID transactions, natively supports HTTP, RESTful and JSON protocols without using third-party components, supports server-side scripting.  For a series of tests on conventional equipment, OrientDB allows you to save 150,000 records per second.  When testing performance, one server with OrientDB was able to replace 125 MySQL servers (of course, on specific queries). <br><br><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c4e/167/6a4/c4e1676a4c2f6be40a8ee423166a4d89.jpg" align="left">  <b>Alexey ROMANENKO</b> , lead programmer of the Mail.Ru Search project, in his report will reveal the features of processing large amounts of data using parallel computing in <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop-</a> based clusters. <br><br>  The MapReduce software model has recently become increasingly popular in the context of processing large amounts of data.  It is great for tasks that can be divided into parts (distributing them to different servers, and then combining the processing results).  The report will discuss typical problems arising from the transfer of standard algorithms to a distributed environment, as well as ways to solve them and practical implementations on the example of the Hadoop / MapReduce framework. <br><br><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3eb/714/72d/3eb71472d3c273ae175e67391e36a19f.jpg" align="left">  <b>Andrei PANGIN</b> , lead programmer of the Odnoklassniki social network, is preparing a report on the experience of the social network in implementing its own solutions on the Java platform.  Classmates are one of the largest public services in the world, built on this technology.  The report discusses the shortcomings of existing networking mechanisms, caching and serialization in Java and offers alternative solutions based on the undocumented features of the Java platform, native libraries, dynamic bytecode generation, and its own algorithms developed by Odnoklassniki. <br><br>  Andrey is engaged in the software platform underlying the portal services, specializing in data storage and transmission systems.  Prior to that, he worked for 6 years at Sun Microsystems, developing Java virtual machines, from CLDC HI to HotSpot JVM.  Perhaps he is the same person who knows everything about Java.  If your project works in Java or you consider Java as a platform for a future large project, you will definitely find many useful things in Alexey‚Äôs report. <br><br><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5fc/f97/335/5fcf9733551bd644c19070c9d3b86b6f.jpg" align="left">  <b>Dmitry Yudin</b> , the VoIP Lab lead developer of the Mail.Ru Group's <nobr>IM division</nobr> , will give a presentation on the voice and video transmission problems that his team faced when designing a VoIP engine that provides audio / video communication inside <a href="http://agent.mail.ru/">Mail.Ru Agent</a> .  The previous publications on Habr√© showed great interest in this topic.  We hope that everyone who wants to get answers to their questions will be able to do this in person at the Technology Forum. <br><br>  Prior to joining the Mail.Ru Group, Dmitry Yudin worked for about 10 years on a similar task at <a href="http://www.spiritdsp.ru/">Spirit DSP</a> , which specialized in voice and video products via IP channels. <br><br><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f53/f0a/c76/f53f0ac76e3e7132257de22aee5d7fef.jpg" align="left">  <b>Sergey SPIRIDONOV</b> , the head of the Allods Online server development team, will talk about how the Allods Online server works, about the architecture and development features.
