However, after some time of use in everyday life, I liked him so much that I wanted to give him a couple of lines. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/743/6ae/361/7436ae361f194aa4b4f9134acd65dc60.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Xiaomi has quite a lot of "light": both <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/288568/">table</a> lamps, and obchnye ( <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/obzory/obzorxiaomiyeelight.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dxiaomi%26utm_campaign%3Dyeeligh">E27</a> ), and, our today's, the pictorial lamp-night lamp <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/xiaomi-yeelight-smart.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dxiaomi%26utm_campaign%3Dbedside">Mi Yeelight Bedside</a> . <br><br>  The lamp is extremely popular, as evidenced by <a href="http://clives-wines.com/page/video/%25D0%259E%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580-%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D1%258B-xiaomi-yeelight-bedside-lamp-review-china-review">dozens of reviews</a> devoted to it.

      For example, the ‚Äúinsides‚Äù of a lamp are shown in <a href="http://en.miui.com/thread-141330-1-1.html">this</a> material. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Lamp inside</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/af4/5b9/1e1/af45b91e1095493dae0a339ee651d224.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d9b/5ce/09d/d9b5ce09dd8545c082faa4ecdd83664b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/655/0cc/42b/6550cc42b52c453fad95531249d844a2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/655/0cc/42b/6550cc42b52c453fad95531249d844a2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a46/81a/2cb/a4681a2cbace4a0ab98eb34fc12a77dd.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/20b/d12/6c6/20bd126c60d44a7a9ea57bc747f3ccf9.jpg"><br></div></div><br>  And <a href="https://alihvast.wordpress.com/2016/07/01/xiaomi-yeelight-%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580-%25D1%2583%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2588%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE-led-%25D1%2581%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8/">here</a> , in a rather detailed analysis, explains how the easiest way to disassemble this lamp.  Suddenly, who will come in handy: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Parsing lamp</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  In order to disassemble the lamp, it is necessary to remove the rubber ring at the bottom, which is attached with double-sided tape or glue.  Next, unscrew the three screws. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/14a/eea/6e1/14aeea6e15d044049e49b0915a2f7df3.jpg"><br><br>  After that, you can pull out the platform with the control board. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a0a/d18/81c/a0ad1881cc7347acac21720389acb738.jpg"><br><br>  For greater stability, the manufacturer inserted a rather massive metal plate into the bottom of the lamp, not forgetting to fix it with three screws. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/4fb/445/171/4fb4451714e84268b286a48d216559d3.jpg"><br><br>  In order to detach the lower metal part, it is necessary to unscrew the 3 L-shaped plastic fasteners.  For loops there are slits, so breaking them is problematic when disassembling.  All electronics from the famous German manufacturer of lighting equipment - Osram. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/389/49c/7de/38949c7de5a14a9497ee16f1c61d3b5d.jpg"><br><br>  And only after that it is possible to examine in detail all parts of the lamp. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/978/6aa/3f5/9786aa3f5fc34a62b906a723607725ab.jpg"><br><br>  As I understand it in the lamp 6 RGB LEDs and 8 ordinary white LEDs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7a1/9be/e0d/7a19bee0d75147408a0c8e2ea43a93b2.jpg"><br><br>  But a uniform glow over the entire height is achieved with the help of such an insert with holes of different diameters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/07b/be3/3a2/07bbe33a2c984429b57d85751ca95c72.jpg"><br></div></div><br>  It should be noted that not all reviews are equally enthusiastic, although the number of positive reviews on Xiaomi Bedside dominates.  Brightness is criticized: here the <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/xiaomis-yeelight-smart-lamp-light-fire-review">author writes</a> that 300 Lm is not suitable for some types of activity, first of all reading!  However, in <a href="https://mysku.ru/blog/china-stores/34275.html">our</a> open spaces, everything is much more straightforward: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/8dc/c48/ef1/8dcc48ef1261439ea115b5ab80284394.png"><br><br>  About 300 Lm were <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/review/342519/xiaomi-yeelight-bedside-lamp">commented</a> on PCmag, however, as a result, it was noted that with the stated characteristics the lamp seemed brighter to the editor.  In any case, it is appropriate to cite another <a href="http://www.candlepowerforums.com/vb/showthread.php%3F418939-Review-of-Xiaomi-Yeelight-Bedside-Lamp">review</a> as an argument, where the author showed how and in what conditions this lamp shines with different settings of photo equipment: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Shine</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7fd/0d4/6e7/7fd0d46e7a8543649bdb43647b886226.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/006/e6e/6ab/006e6e6abd7947e8b1e0a963a6359dcd.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b2e/552/e65/b2e552e6519b4ad69996ae9997a1fe3b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/197/23a/da3/19723ada35c44b0ab9b07402c6cdb012.jpg"><br></div></div><br>  I liked the lamp.  First of all, its management capabilities.  Light - light, but in this case, this lamp is simply very convenient, and this should be noted.  Given the specifics and purpose of the nightlight, it seems to me, Xiaomi did even more than necessary. <br><br>  <b>The lamp can be controlled:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Using applications </li></ul><br>  This is a proprietary application Yeelight and Mi Home.  If you do not use other devices from the ‚ÄúMi‚Äù smart home, then it is better to use the personal lamp app.  This, at a minimum, will open up opportunities for other ways to control, and of course, Russian, yes. <br><br>  For example, when working with Mi Home, the second Mi Band was denied to pair with this lamp. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/716/be5/4af/716be54af3544c1aab61d42530d70f33.png"><br><br><ul><li>  From background </li></ul><br>  When installing Yeelight on Android, a ‚Äúcurtain‚Äù is launched, by pulling which you can get quick access to some functions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/91b/0c0/b41/91b0c0b4120a46c1a3a0736b0948d311.png"><br><br><ul><li>  Using widgets </li></ul><br>  The application allows you to "throw" on the main screen of the smartphone the main elements in the form of widgets, and it is sometimes convenient. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/680/eac/b2a/680eacb2a9e248caa3da0c200a7997f8.png"><br><br><ul><li>  Manually </li></ul><br>  It was obvious.  The lamp is equipped with two control buttons and a light control dashboard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c49/31c/de3/c4931cde37dc4c97a3963eef93b3cd91.JPG"><br><br>  Some combinations are also available: for example, holding down the mode-switching button and controlling the touch panel will allow you to change some of the colors suggested.  For other functions, for example, activation of night light, software is already needed. <br><br><ul><li>  Mi Band </li></ul><br>  The Xiaomi bracelet is not quite a way to control the lamp: when synchronizing with the tracker, the lamp will ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù that you are asleep and go out. <br><br>  <b>application</b> <br><br>  The main way to set up a lamp is an application.  The lamp works via Bluetooth, so to control the nightlight, the user must be nearby, which is quite achievable: usually bedside tables are located next to the bed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d7f/d69/6e5/d7fd696e581b4924bd45c9214076efdf.JPG"><br><br>  After quick synchronization, the main menu management will be available: this is a bar of icons at the bottom of the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/cfe/199/deb/cfe199deb83c4342a7c48bbf5d32ce87.jpg"><br><br>  It's all quite simple: turn on / off, adjust the brightness, adjust the color.  Brightness is adjustable from the left: up-down, color - from the top (right-left).  Also here you can configure the mode of changing colors, which, in turn, can be selected manually from the list provided or having photographed some object at home.  At an accelerated pace: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dnuaPo7Z2B4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The ‚Äúpulsation‚Äù mode and its speed are configured in a special section.  As already noted, this can be done using the proposed settings or upload photos yourself.  The speed is indicated by the "bug".  And that's nice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/2e1/2a7/88b/2e12a788bf604b648ae6382d5c83669f.jpg"><br><br>  In general, attention to detail is Xiaomi's forte.  When launching the application, you can see the first menu, where, by the way, some control methods are also available, and the status of the lamp is also shown: and the color with which the lamp is currently lit also lights up on the icon.  If the lamp is in pulsation mode, the icon will be multi-colored. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/33b/3f3/0f0/33b3f30f0890427191952229412cf09c.jpg"><br><br>  Some general settings are also available here.  Moreover, by saying ‚Äúsome‚Äù I really, to shame and criticism, could not understand what was the matter: for example, what ‚ÄúLAN Management‚Äù remained a mystery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/39b/773/83a/39b77383a57445208237107afa7a1999.jpg"><br><br>  The basic mode settings are in the main menu.  Here you can control the pairing with the bracelet, set the night mode and wake-up time, as well as set several automatic on / off scripts on a schedule. <br><br>  In principle, the version of the settings in Mi Home and in Yeelight are no different.  The only thing that is available in the personal application is the rendering of widgets to the desktop, well, and as it was already written, for some reason the second Mi Band is not connected to Mi Home. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/30c/1ef/d39/30c1efd39f364451aeafc3f7e841970f.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Impressions</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c31/64f/678/c3164f678e7e4b83b816d0067b028d77.JPG"><br><br>  Frankly, I am delighted.  Very comfortable, practical and stylish.  The design of <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/xiaomi-yeelight-smart.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dxiaomi%26utm_campaign%3Dbedside">Xiaomi Bedside is</a> very pleasant, the management is thought out: at night, if you have to get up and walk somewhere, you don‚Äôt even need to look for an already very visible button - just drag your fingers across the surface.  Also in a number of reviews this lamp is recommended as a nightlight for a nursery due to its soft color and remote control capabilities. <br><br>  The only thing that seemed strange: a fork.  Given that the application is Russified, and the lamp is clearly localized for Russian-speaking users, in the Bedside delivery with a Chinese plug, so an adapter is needed. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403957/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403957/</a></p>
