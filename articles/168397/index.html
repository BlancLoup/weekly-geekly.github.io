Today we, pardon the pun, summarize the results and present to your judgment Samsung .  We should note that, for the most part, the 2013 models are extremely fashionable, but we still hope that Habravchan will be interested in looking at them, especially since they are not at all bad for the sound quality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/627/bf6/93c/627bf693cdf22eb038ec8ebbc847472d.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The new line of audio devices is intended to be a harmonious addition to the new Samsung TVs and includes:

    <ul><li>  <b>The Soundbar with a tube amplifier (model HW-F750)</b> is the world's first <b>soundbar</b> format system with a built-in tube amplifier. </li><li>  <b>Portable Bluetooth Speaker (Model DA-F60)</b> is a compact audio system equipped with the new aptX codec and support for NFC connections. </li><li>  <b>Home theater format 7.1 (model HT-F9750W)</b> - audio system for home theater, designed specifically for the new line of Samsung 2013 TV. </li><li>  <b>Premium Blu-Ray Player (BD-F7500)</b> is an advanced Ultra High Definition (UHD) player that supports ultra high definition image formats. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/036/5ad/54e/0365ad54e3c77ff6cd90ef149b05b701.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So, in order.  The <b>soundbar Samsung HW-F750</b> audio system is equipped with a tube amplifier that promises to give a warm and natural sound.  The metal design of the SoundBar case is really well combined with the appearance of the new line of premium Samsung TVs, which this year will storm the markets of the whole world, including Russia.  The built-in gyro sensor will automatically adjust the sound regardless of the position in which the system will be installed, and it can be installed both vertically and horizontally.  ‚ÄúSoundbar‚Äù HW-750 is equipped with proprietary technology Samsung Sound Share, which provides the ability to wirelessly stream audio via Bluetooth-connection. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/da4/846/86d/da484686d680e1f35237ab70529f1c5c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Being quite easy to use, Samsung‚Äôs new audio system also gives the user the ability to control various functions and modes from the TV remote control: when connected to the same system as the TV box, the soundbar will automatically turn on when the TV is turned on.  The elegant design of the metal frame of the audio system and the autonomous wireless subwoofer personifies the synergy of noble classics and ultramodernity, which will undoubtedly allow the HW-F750 audio system to take pride of place in any interior. <br><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/6439/97556372.c4/0_a0893_1be749e4_XL" alt="image"><br><br>  Modern man is increasingly using smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices as the main repository of music and other multimedia content.  This has become the norm, thankfully, the volumes of the carriers allow even the most avid moviegoers and audiophiles to roam.  It is quite logical that a modern person wants to always have at hand a source that would give out high quality sound anywhere and anytime.  This is where the new <b>Samsung DA-F60</b> Bluetooth portable speaker weighs just over 1300 grams and has the functionality of a full-fledged audio system. <br><br>  The design of the DA-F60 uses neodymium magnets and a passive radiator, providing a sound level that can often be found in high-end audio systems.  The device is characterized by such characteristics as low-frequency reproduction and the absence of distortion even at high volume levels.  The built-in technology of aptX-codecs will help to raise the sound quality one step higher.  NFC support will allow you to connect compatible devices, including the new GALAXY S III and GALAXY Note II smartphones, with a simple touch of a mobile device to the audio system.  In addition, the presence of proprietary technology Samsung AllShare means that the user can use the DA-F60 as an external speaker for the Samsung Smart TV, connecting it via a Bluetooth connection. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/627/bf6/93c/627bf693cdf22eb038ec8ebbc847472d.png"><br><br>  The <b>Samsung HT-F9750W</b> 7.1 format home theater system was also designed with an eye to the new line of Samsung TVs.  As it happened, the device has a sophisticated design, extremely pleasing to the eye.  The proprietary Sound On technology, implemented in Samsung's 2013 TVs, will allow users (assuming the HT-F9750W is connected to the TV) to instantly switch the sound from the built-in audio system to the 1330-watt home theater audio system at the touch of a button on the remote control.  Samsung's flagship home theater system has a proprietary hybrid amplifier system (tube amplifier + digital amplifier), as well as the latest Smart TV features that open up new multimedia entertainment features. <br><br>  The new DTS Neo Fusion codec, developed exclusively for Samsung, and a gallium nitride (GaN) amplifier provide excellent sound in the range up to 80 kHz.  Combined with a tube amplifier designed for pre-amplification, the home theater system will allow users to enjoy pure sound without distortion.  In addition, the CPID speaker increases the sound resolution so that the listener can catch every nuance of a particular piece of music.  7.1-channel home theater audio system supports not only horizontal, but also vertical sound panorama without the need to use a pivotal speaker. <br><br>  A distinctive feature of the new home theater is also the high quality of the image, which gives the brand Samsung 4K Scaler.  And the processor also allows you to convert high-definition content into the now becoming ultra-high-definition format - UHD.  This means that the new home theater will be compatible with all future ultra-high definition televisions, including the new Samsung Smart TV models, which will soon appear on the domestic market. <br><br>  The Blu-ray component included in the HT-F9750W home theater system allows you to run multiple applications at the same time, and is also equipped with the latest version of the Samsung Smart Hub and Samsung AllShare.  Undoubtedly, the new 7.1-channel Samsung home theater is the perfect choice for people who need an advanced home entertainment center with excellent sound quality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4fb/f6e/5f3/4fbf6e5f39b4aab3bdc29d0d906fd62c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The <b>Samsung</b> Premium <b>BD-F7500</b> Ultra-High-Definition Image Support (UHD) slim Blu-ray player provides a realistic picture on the screen and, thanks to the image scaling system from SD / HD to UHD, allows you to take a fresh look at your favorite movies from your home collection.  The player features a proprietary dual-core processor running at 900 MHz, and the Samsung Smart TV ecosystem, which allows you to fully enjoy all the joys of the intuitive and user-friendly Smart Hub interface and AllShare broad communication capabilities. <br><br>  It is worth noting that the Samsung BD-F7500 Blu-Ray player and the Samsung HW-F750 soundbar were awarded the CES Innovation Award for the best innovations. <br><br>  Unfortunately, detailed specifications, exact prices and dates of sales have not yet been made public.  Will wait! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/168397/">https://habr.com/ru/post/168397/</a></p>
