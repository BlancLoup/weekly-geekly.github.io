We are often asked where to find an intelligent email marketing team.  How to find someone who can handle mailings?  What qualities will he need?  We decided to summarize our experience in this post. <br><br>  So, looking for an internet marketer or mailing list manager.  This material can also be useful for assessing the suitability of specialists working for you. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Required skills</b> <br>  Paradoxically, an intelligent marketer working with mailing lists should know not only the market, analytics.  He should speak the language better than a copywriter and fumble at least a little in html.  These skills will be needed because he will work in a team with these people, organizing their work.  It is difficult to organize or monitor the correct implementation of what you do not understand.  Sometimes corrections will be made in the course of work: it is useful to sit down with a coder next to and check the work done, making edits and modifying the newsletter.  And to understand that people who are connected with you by a common goal are doing is necessary.  Just as it is necessary to convey to them the concept of this common goal.

      <b>The ability to be friends with the sales department</b> <br>  Your marketer or mailing list manager should have good communication skills.  To increase the chances of a good return on mailings, he will need to establish a reliable communication channel with the sales department: sales people should be aware of what is selling and when, and the marketer must clearly know what to sell and when.  Often, after sending out the leads, they are ‚Äúabandoned‚Äù - if the lead has clicked on the link, then let the sales people already deal with it.  This is fundamentally wrong and leads to the loss of a client. <br><br>  <b>Flexibility</b> <br>  It is no secret that in marketing mailing lists, you need to collect as much data as possible, analyze them, and then build a further strategy based on the data obtained.  Sometimes you have to give up the strategy that you really liked, because it does not work.  If a person lacks such flexibility, nothing will work out with mailings. <br><br>  <b>Work speed</b> <br>  Not once had to see the marketing departments, where everything goes quietly, sleepily and calmly.  Until the marketer bursts in with the fiery god of maran, he will not distribute the magic pendals to everyone and the work will not be accelerated for some time, in order to wallow again in the sleepy depths.  A familiar picture, yes?  And not only in marketing it can be observed.  So, such a mailing list manager is not suitable for us.  Marketing is war.  Here strategy and tactics are important, decisive throws "at the last moment" here are more likely to fail. <br><br>  <b>"Techie" or "humanities"?</b> <br>  A strange opinion about the fact that marketing is a great place for the humanities.  The very fact that there is a need for clear analytics and monitoring seems to contradict this.  On the issue of humanities and creatives.  They are not suitable.  Online marketing or Internet marketing involves collecting and processing databases, as well as a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãtedious, meticulous work on methodical project preparation and decision-making based on facts and statistics, not on intuition and ‚ÄúI think so.‚Äù  Here a person with a mathematical or engineering education is more suitable than a graduate of philology. <br><br>  <b>Portfolio</b> <br>  The mailing manager, as a rule, has a certain portfolio of works - what were mailings, grounding pages, actions.  But what you should be interested in first and foremost is sales and leads.  Then you can see the statistics of mailings.  Only these figures objectively indicate whether the marketer is coping with his responsibilities.  You can spend a lot of time and effort to make very beautiful mailings, but not bring customers.  We don't need such marketing. <br><br><h4>  Where to find such a mailing list manager? </h4><br>  Perhaps he will come to you for an interview.  And now you already know what the main aspects to pay attention to when meeting.  Perhaps you have already looked after such a person from your former team and lure him to your job.  You can also try to look for freelancers - because  in relation to the freelancer, your obligations as an employer are much less than when hiring an employee, you can ‚Äútest‚Äù the various skills of your potential employee. <br><br><h5>  PS </h5>  Test the capabilities of the UniSender service: <b>use the <a href="http://www.unisender.com/ru/testdrive/">free test drive of our services</a></b> : you can run several mailings through UniSender absolutely free.
