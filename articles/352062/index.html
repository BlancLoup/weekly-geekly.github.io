I present to you the translation of the article Mischa von Nachtigal <a href="https://builttoadapt.io/how-to-explain-your-tech-job-to-your-family-905a7c367e2a">'s How to Explain Your Tech Job for Your Family</a> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2_/wn/fy/2_wnfyumdajxpizi283r1ixi71s.jpeg"></div><br>  A list of metaphors that can easily help you convey the essence of your profession in IT at the dinner table. <br><br>  So let's go! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  <b>Foreword</b> </h3><br>  Your company is a bakery.  Baking is an application.  Sometimes your bakery sells buns directly to people, i.e.  end users (b2c applications), but sometimes you sell them to other companies (b2b applications), which in turn deliver your product to people.

    <h3>  <b>Position</b> </h3><br>  <b>Project manager</b> <br><br>  Your task is to develop a strategy for the bakery or for a specific product - what tastes and characteristics your product should have, as well as what types of products your company will launch on the market.  When developing a product, you represent the consumer side.  You help to transform feedback into new ideas (for example, adding a new syrup or a new type of baking), and also help to make decisions so that the product is popular and corresponds to a certain level of quality.  You do not control the chef and do not control the bakery, but you set the general direction of business development, offering including options for expansion, such as creating a coffee shop.  holding master classes, music shows, catering at various events, etc. <br><br>  <b>Industrial designer</b> <br><br>  You are some kind of boss.  You define customer preferences, develop recipes and make sure that the decisions made are really what they want from the bakery.  But you do not bake treats, you figure out how and what product gets to the buyer - from the menu and packaging to its taste.  You control what your team is doing exactly that product: with the right taste of syrup - but not only for new types of baking, but also for existing ones, so that customers remain satisfied with them in the future.  As for new types of products, you are developing their prototypes.  determine how they will settle down and decide whether the game is worth the candle. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l8/4x/gp/l84xgpncvwbivc9yv6o1miqswlg.gif"></div><br>  <b>Engineer (developer)</b> <br><br>  You are a baker.  You know how to cook all kinds of different types of baking and use the oven.  In your work you use different cooking methods - cutting, chopping, roasting, beating.  From pies to buns, from muffins to bread - you know what technologies and stages are needed, what temperatures and tools will make your product great!  You work closely with a product manager and industrial designer to do exactly what consumers expect.  Sometimes you notice.  that the conceived design or characteristic of the product can make it difficult to prepare it and then you and the team try to find a way out of the situation.  If it comes to a new product, then you decide whether it is possible from a technical point of view and try to master new technologies to solve the problem. <br><br>  <b>Sysadmin</b> <br><br>  Imagine a large network of bakeries, with hundreds of different types of baking, which ideally would be baked simultaneously in a massive oven, so as not to lose time, but they all require different temperatures.  Your task is to ensure that everything flows smoothly.  that one or another portion of products is baked according to the rules and can be sold to customers, that the bakery itself does not overheat and there are no threats of its destruction due to high volumes of work.  You are also responsible for safety - fire safety and, if necessary, fire fighting and always in search of increasing the efficiency of the bakery. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f6/cp/_c/f6cp_cxclvba1o4kspua8oxtkac.gif"></div><br>  <b>Product Marketer</b> <br><br>  You are working on a showcase, as well as on the menu.  It depends on you to attract new consumers for tasting and buying baked goods. <br><br><h3>  Terms </h3><br>  <b>APIs</b> <br><br>  Dials on the oven <br><br>  <b>Cloud</b> <br><br>  A large network oven that allows you to deliver your pastries all over the world at high speed. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jg/ti/lz/jgtilzdpbehjvipb3jsdke9ewas.gif"></div><br>  <b>Machine learning</b> <br><br>  The ovens suddenly became very smart and can perform independently functions such as setting the required temperature depending on the type of baking or help with some stages of the process (rolling, kneading dough, readiness, etc.). Machine learning also helps the bakery itself, for example collecting recommendations from previous purchases and other data. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qg/b8/5d/qgb85d4mhfyrttomehin2rjnbp4.gif"></div><br>  <b>Pair programming</b> <br><br>  Two bakers prepare pastries together, helping each other and discussing the results at the end of the process.  Usually the results of such work is a cooler product and an effective team.  And it saves time.  Every five. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/352062/">https://habr.com/ru/post/352062/</a></p>
