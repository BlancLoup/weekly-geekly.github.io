That is, the impossibility of using two SIM cards in one device without rearranging the SIM cards without unnecessary manipulations.  And about a year ago I found a way to try to overcome this.  External sim module <a href="http://www.piece4sim.com/">PIECE4sim</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b57/623/71b/b5762371bb030a597ed3c897568f6344.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The device, announced on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/35224746/piece-change-the-way-you-use-smart-phones/description">Kickstarter</a> , promised alluring freedom from a second phone, placed in a shirt pocket and even in a purse.  Communication via economical Bluetooth, synchronized address book, the ability to connect to iPhone, iPad and Android devices.  In general, tomorrow is today.  The device‚Äôs motto is ‚ÄúThe next small thing‚Äù and it‚Äôs not surprising that the team collected much more - $ 402,214 instead of the requested $ 35,000. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      TTX device amaze with their capabilities: <br>  - Communication of the radio module using the Bluetoth 4.0 protocol <br>  - Built-in battery with a capacity of 550 mAh, which should be enough for 4 hours of conversation or 150 hours in Standby mode <br>  - iOS and Android support <br>  - Supported frequencies 850/900/1800/1900 MHz <br>  - Camera control using the function key <br>  - A loss / theft alarm and two-way radar <br>  - Black and white body colors <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aee/8e7/b3d/aee8e7b3df58362dcde9fe8b4f1b0961.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I did not specifically fit into the project on Kickstarter, which started on July 27, 2015, because I know that such projects sometimes ... do not shoot.  Therefore, I waited a few months after the end of the campaign, in order to see the seriousness of the company's intentions, and on October 7, 2015 I ordered the device on the website, knowing that shipping to sponsors from Kickstarter is about to begin.  And here the most interesting began. <br><br>  For several months, the team allegedly negotiated with the plant, which will make them iron, then something broke and the plant changed dramatically.  In order to reassure investors, showed pictures from the new plant and how the device will look.  But some backers already grumbled with displeasure and doubted the profitability of their investments.  Then (a total of more than five months had passed), the first shipments of the devices to customers were solemnly announced, and this somehow encouraged and calmed the people, but the rumble and the courts that this was not an original product, but a Chinese hand-made article ( <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/35224746/piece-change-the-way-you-use-smart-phones/comments%3Fcursor%3D12487638">and links</a> ) did not stop.  And some people stubbornly sat down with the idea that PIECE4sim would suffer the same fate as <a href="http://solar-news.ru/main/viro-telefon-prizrak">the ghost phone of the</a> VIRO startup. <br><br>  After receiving the first devices, it turned out that there is no original software in the AppStore and it needs to be downloaded from some Chinese site, giving it permission to access the phone.  Swift, is not it?  But people with Android devices generally could not wait for at least some kind of software. <br><br>  The reviews of the installed software were multidirectional, but their vector was striving for ‚Äúeverything is bad‚Äù: the program crashes, does not catch contacts, does not consistently receive calls and SMS, not localized EVEN IN ENGLISH! <br><br>  I was horrified to read the comments on Kickstarter, and at that time I myself was waiting for the parcel and hoped that the fate of those who received a frank marriage / slag had passed.  It turns out that my package was lost somewhere.  Scum!  But I was even a little glad that it would be possible to return my hard-earned money (about $ 80, for a second), but the persistent and resilient Chinese, and it turned out to be a Chinese company, cheerfully reported on each of my letters, that we, they say, find the package and send it at your own expense.  And I got it.  Ten months have passed since the date of my order and about a year from the date of the successful completion of the campaign.  I must say that the manufacturer did write down the application in the AppStore to AUGUST (and it is possible that it was on Google Play, but I was not particularly interested). <br><br>  As a result, I now have this: <br><br><h3>  pros </h3><br>  <strong>1.</strong> Really compact device.  Has its own battery.  According to the specification - its own radio module, which in theory allows the use of two SIM cards in <a href="http://4pda.ru/2016/09/18/324218/">DSDA</a> mode. <br><br>  <strong>2. The</strong> ability to use iPhone contacts, as well as add new contacts to the address book directly from the application. <br><br>  <strong>3.</strong> The range is 10 meters.  You can freely ‚Äúforget‚Äù the device on the table or in the pocket of your jacket and go to the next room or the kitchen.  If the connection with the phone is broken, a clear signal sounds. <br><br><h3>  Minuses: </h3><br>  <strong>1.</strong> There is really no DSDA mode - if during a conversation on PIECE4sim they call the main iPhone number, the call fails.  In the priority of the iPhone.  This, as well as a faster discharge of the battery, suggests that the radio module of the donor phone is used. <br><br>  <strong>2.</strong> Battery.  Battery device "one hundred percent Chinese."  This means that it can now show 7%, and in a few minutes - already 12. The same applies to the charge: from 20% to 60% it charges in 15 minutes even when charging 0.5A from the computer. <br><br>  The phone battery is discharged at double speed.  Before connecting the sim card, I had 30-40% of the battery left in the evening, if I didn‚Äôt play on the way to PokemonGO, now in the evening there are 10-15% left if I don‚Äôt play. <br><br>  <strong>3.</strong> Instability work.  Very often, the Bluetooth connection is broken and you have to reconnect.  Very often the call is interrupted.  Sometimes the music does not play when an incoming call, SMS is not heard at all.  I am glad that sometimes incoming messages are duplicated on Apple Watch - then you can somehow track it. <br><br>  <strong>4.</strong> The case materials are identical to the battery - it is strongly not recommended to sit down on the device, since  thin plastic and even with gaps it seems now and then it threatens to break not only from the weight of the body, but simply in the pocket with the keys <br><br>  And how beautiful it all looks on the video: <br><div class="oembed"><div><div style="left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"><video controls="" style="top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;">  Your browser does not support HTML5 video. <source src="https://ksr-video.imgix.net/projects/1947232/video-564220-h264_high.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></div></div></div><br><br>  <b>TOTAL: a</b> good (in theory) device, which, if the stability is refined, would be a good alternative to a second phone.  Not the original - the Chinese, it turns out, have been slapping them for a long time and in packs, but with their own language, but this device is, after all, in English.  A little expensive for such an unfinished device, but in general - it performs its function and until Apple introduces a smartphone with two SIM cards (and there are rumors that in 2018 it will happen), I will better use it, than drag the second phone and look for a contact in one to call from the other. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397871/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397871/</a></p>
