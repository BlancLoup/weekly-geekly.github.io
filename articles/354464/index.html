  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Interfaces in the real world-4: updates to the traditional pieces</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Many interfaces are designed to remove user problems.  We find a problem that was previously solved traditionally, and no one even thought that something could be done about it.  And we come up with a new solution.  For example, this is not just a bad peephole, it is a brilliant invention of a person who gives an apartment to guests of the city.  So that I would not wake him up at night with a call like ‚ÄúMan, come, take the keys, I‚Äôm leaving you,‚Äù he just took off his peephole.  Now the keys get through this hole. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qu/mc/wq/qumcwqtcwgg1lw_ftzu3npzod5k.jpeg"><br><br>  I leave at any convenient time, throw the keys there - and everything is ready.  He comes, opens the door with his kit and picks up the guest from the floor.  There is the opposite of such an interface in terms of convenience - a system for setting a wagon number in one of the RZD (FPK) trains. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Here she is: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/c3/u5/vv/c3u5vv83-av5elbchyryhdvkloc.jpeg"><br><br>  She is still waiting for her specialist. <br><br>  Here is the Spanish solution to the problem of flying away tablecloths.  All our lives we have been wetting the tablecloth.  This is especially practical in a storm on a yacht.  Wet tablecloth is a tradition.  Another problem is solved by non-skid such slightly sticky polymers.  But no, the Spaniards know how to do it right: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1m/pe/5a/1mpe5ador49n9kcmyhl_ar3lrei.jpeg"><br>  <sup>Four of these braces - and sha, no one flies anywhere.</sup>  <sup>In Barcelona it is very important - the wind from the sea.</sup> <br><br>  But the guys in Riga have figured out how to properly sell slippers.  Here they had a clear pain - just by the appearance behind the glass of the automaton it is not clear how soft and silky they are.  The solution lay on the surface, it would seem, but traditionally no one did this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/el/ng/ok/elngokf6wbev_ohnczz1svkfw8w.jpeg"><br>  <sup>Devilish geniuses.</sup>  <sup>If it were not for the price of 3500 rubles for a pair of green slippers made of natural sheep wool, I would definitely fly home to them.</sup> <br><br>  One of the distillery near Port Ellen in Scotland.  They really wanted social proof that a lot of people bought their cool firewater.  Therefore, a simple mechanic took the box from the book, inserted the pole and stuck it in the box.  This is a cross between gamification (I want yours to win) and really good infographics.  I have seen variations of this method in a couple of places in Scotland for social proof: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/61/po/ju/61pojuebfmgftlrpydz_uifvgmo.jpeg"><br><br>  But the guys wanted to make it clearer, but only complicated them - this is a table of something in the store for geeks.  The problem is that it was possible to accompany the icons with the inscription.  In the mobile version of the inscription go away, and you quietly go nuts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yn/q7/2l/ynq72llu5ncke-cttdjkbaoup3q.png"><br><br>  Sugar bags - we may have a new generation.  You know that the sugar in the tea is then stirred, right?  So, for this you need a separate element - a mixer.  Now there is no: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/c3/i3/ji/c3i3jimilixckhq_aua9znb4nay.jpeg"><br><br>  Spoon right inside the sugar.  The guys who sell this in a cafe are level 80 marketers.  Because it is an art to increase the cost of the package (and so clearly squeeze the market from the manufacturers of dishes).  I hope only, they have all the price is folded. <br><br>  Or, Moscow waltz evening (formerly the Physicotechnical Institute).  It would seem that the mechanics worked to the limit - everything can be done as usual.  But delight begins in the little things: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/we/dx/sw/wedxswutdpvgauw4ymutxvmhtta.jpeg"><br><br>  Someone thought of a plaster for dancing feet.  Someone put wet wipes near the chocolate fountain.  Someone laid out candies for breath freshening on the buffet (critical for the same tango).  They even made ‚ÄúI know the next dance‚Äù signs to make cross-pollination more effective.  And a lot of other things that are usually ignored.  I remember that at the Northern Economic Forum in the dressing rooms of the speakers there were such baskets: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tz/sf/ft/tzsfftvnoqu5ev8pjxnyqnjbku0.jpeg"><br>  <sup>Also do not leave a chance to get upset.</sup> <br><br>  New generation of containers: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2w/ob/k5/2wobk5dppmgrkxbplfjxjfez3pe.jpeg"><br><br>  Pay attention to the tear strip at the back.  That it serves as "hinges", and after closing the box - lock.  There perforation, and it comes off in one motion.  Everything, no torment, under it two huge ledges.  The container opens with delight. <br><br>  Boeing realized that the yard is the twenty-first century.  The new liner is generally pleasant in terms of usability.  Pay attention to how cool they kept the coat hanger (although I never saw it used in the economy) and added a USB port: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v3/z0/dt/v3z0dtswism5ve02mdj3eo960du.jpeg"><br><br>  Another cool find of them is the mirrors in the luggage racks above, so that even low passengers can see that they have got everything and nothing has fallen.  Very cool. <br><br>  Here in the stairwell painted floor.  From brown to charter brown.  To the tenants do not plunge, caring dudes made here such virtual fencing: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4x/yz/qg/4xyzqgekngcklr6m0dsm2zwlf3a.jpeg"><br><br>  Do you know how often something is damaged when opening a transport package?  Enough.  We have accumulated 3011 games over the past year, the boxes of which were damaged.  By an approximate estimate, from 20% to 30% of them - just at the opening of the transport container.  The problem was solved elegantly by the Swedes: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/on/w2/mm/onw2mms5rytnqfygcl0jdrgyh3q.jpeg"><br><br>  Here is a burger.  Standard solution: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vu/lo/k1/vulok1ephxr2l-y-8pdeciinrzu.jpeg"><br><br>  The Black Star burger franchise with strange sauces - raspberry, chocolate and others came to the franchise exhibition.  They are so frost-bitten that together with a sandwich filled with sauces, they were given medical disposable gloves.  As disposable tableware.  This is one of their chips.  With such pleasure, without fearing to be overwhelmed by the ears, I have never eaten fast-food. <br><br>  Here are the guys have learned to sell watches in the store, solving the problem of calculations: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n8/pi/bt/n8pibtrag8ws1olf5t8zpkktf6o.jpeg"><br><br>  And this is the console from the sofa.  Why a sofa remote?  Until this year, I did not know until the Italian furniture dealers explained that there is a need to lay out a sofa when you are thoroughly old.  And in order not to tear the back, let it folds and lays out the electric motor: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yx/bn/5w/yxbn5whtx7hgd5mckzfd87wdpac.jpeg"><br><br>  In fact, in Russia, ‚ÄúShaitan-sofas‚Äù are used for the wow effect, and they sell regular ones, without a robot and batteries inside <br><br>  Stretch laces solve the problem of tying-unleashing: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8q/oc/sd/8qocsdul7aqxq-fejjgbkvy9evm.jpeg"><br><br>  Although, of course, this is better at times: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eb/tz/tm/ebtztmhk-2irjxf8lgj54j3ojkc.jpeg"><br><br>  This package breaks exactly in the right place and does not splash: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dp/u_/ti/dpu_tixuyit37g-2-ora5ggzoxg.jpeg"><br><br>  Plastic money!  It is strange that this is the case in Australia, but no longer in Micronesia: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7z/ob/ii/7zobiiojisxiyvexumzl8nny45y.jpeg"><br><br>  The key has orientation and two rows of teeth: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bh/1a/7y/bh1a7ysnkqjfz6hiw96xvtkyohi.jpeg"><br><br>  Another easy opening container: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fe/uo/ee/feuoeedgygtk5-g1tzrelh6mnvw.jpeg"><br><br>  Reflectors sunk into asphalt near a double solid: in Greenland, this is solved by buried barrels, and in Australia - by reflectors: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4y/ks/0i/4yks0ihizawiyocqk1s6zrefuvk.jpeg"><br><br>  And here are the barrels: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ic/s6/7c/ics67cbxasy96ev4u7hjgn90tt8.jpeg"><br><br>  Germans hand out carts for the zoo: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kw/vl/0n/kwvl0nbb68milfz3x3p26bzhzvy.jpeg"><br><br>  Here is the coolest Bauhaus kettle: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/na/fl/tn/nafltn3v6y0a-t4z7ftg5jxqd5y.jpeg"><br><br>  But the Philippine kettle with protection from strait: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zw/_1/g5/zw_1g5lb_f-hprb3f1_gcjjcnwm.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lf/gu/gz/lfgugzl83_npw9nbixycb3u70-m.jpeg"><br><br>  And European with filling tags: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/il/zg/_3/ilzg_3jxfawoszyamayrn8-cgeq.jpeg"><br><br>  Stunning beauty protection lamps (in Moscow there are a couple of these, too): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zf/tc/ok/zftcokjfst-s42-sphl8dil5ddm.jpeg"><br><br>  But the solution is absolutely brilliant problem in the bar: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4j/hm/xl/4jhmxlxqv1extxn7zmjjrewtxxq.jpeg"><br><br>  And, of course, if you do not like the service in the store for survival supplies, you can click on the button: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/04/kv/ly/04kvlyl5ipwhvlbrw5xtntgiqtq.jpeg"><br><br>  And a cool fountain with drinking water: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xd/7z/vy/xd7zvyjzskvolujfgkkdngyfvxi.jpeg"><br><br>  I do not know whether you paid attention to the shape of the last few millimeters of bottlenecks.  I didn‚Äôt pay until I found out from a respected physicist that the ring on the very edge is not a capturing fascination (in wine bottles the cork is completely clogged inside), but a means to make the jet flow evenly, without splashes: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lz/z0/bg/lzz0bgwo6os8y0r7kjbhkrfcw1i.jpeg"><br><br>  RM Williams makes in the shoe box (with a lifetime warranty) a check pocket: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ew/my/tl/ewmytlhv08vjqf7vvmt7dvcmvwy.jpeg"><br><br>  The traffic light when repairing the road (when going alternately in one lane there or back) knows how many minutes you stand: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x7/st/av/x7stavtxetd9l-pmrh_n-t3gidy.jpeg"><br><br>  For now.  <a href="https://habr.com/company/mosigra/blog/251465/">Here</a> <a href="https://habr.com/company/mosigra/blog/308656/">are the</a> <a href="https://habr.com/company/mosigra/blog/232505/">past</a> <a href="https://habr.com/company/mosigra/blog/268211/">posts</a> with such things. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/354464/">https://habr.com/ru/post/354464/</a></p>
