Who needs to study in a modern university, my experiment is a year long in one of Kharkov universities. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  How it started. <br></h1><br>  Hello ladies and gentlemen. <br>  I am a second year student at Kharkov National University of Radio Electronics, Department of Information Technology Security, and I became a participant in my own experiment in a long academic year. <br><br>  It all started with the fact that from school I noticed a certain predisposition of teachers to certain students and hostility to others, regardless of knowledge.  At school, it was argued as follows: ‚ÄúWe are all people, teachers spend more time with you than their relatives, and they are tied‚Äù And this was true.  At school, teachers spend more than 6 years with a handful of students, and therefore we so often cross the frontier of business relations.  This is normal and even more - this is good, at school we are just children. <br><br>  And now the long-awaited step into adulthood, the semester of study and the picture suddenly repeats.  Hundreds of students pass through teachers, time to memorize names is a semester and less, and there are still certain sympathies.  I wondered what the keys to success were.

    <h1>  The essence of the experiment. <br></h1><br>  So there were three people I was following.  One object wildly worked, read the material a week before the lecture, during the lecture and a week after, did not sleep at night, because of study, deprived himself of the joys of friendship and communication, boobs, beer, basic hygiene, and even in these of his Internet not to find if it is not about the abstract or coursework.  All his life activity was to maintain normal vital signs and studies.  The second was a man who spent all the time on the Internet or in a brewery with friends, he didn‚Äôt study and didn‚Äôt try.  I must say that he was naturally clever, and perhaps smarter than the first, but did not develop it.  The third was our headman.  He was not naturally a clever man, but was very sociable.  He could sit at home all day long and carefully paint something on pieces of paper, and come and pass everything before the exam (he did not draw money).  The most surprising was that their results differed slightly.  That is, the university didn‚Äôt care to let out a lazy one, a specialist or an artist, even if one considers that the specialty is very responsible and very difficult to master many aspects.  I did not understand who to blame and whether to do it, so I entered the image of a detective and began my investigation. <br><br>  I decided to incarnate in each of them for a semester and see what would come of it. <br><br>  Immediately I must stipulate what errors I made in conducting the experiments: <br>  ‚Ä¢ I bathed.  Yes, yes is sinful. <br>  ‚Ä¢ I could not become a headman, so I decided to combine the second and third characters into one: I did not study, I sat on the Internet or drew. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The second and third are my best friends, so it was very easy for me to adopt their lifestyle, while the first did not interest me at all, and I could only guess how he really lives. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Some teachers stayed more than a semester and I had to put up with a reputation. <br><br><h1>  Semester first.  Life at the limit. <br></h1><br><br>  Hell itself was happening at the beginning.  After the summer, outdoor activities, daily football and boxing, music and films, drunks and walkers, I interrupted everything.  Formatted the hard drive and put a clean Windows, cut the battery out of the phone, broke up with the girl, sawed out of contact, icq, changed the password on the Google account, blew all the players and players, and went to the balcony loudly shouted.  To my surprise, there was no breakage, no foam at the mouth, but on the contrary, I felt free.  Tyler may have smiled while reading this, but really it was something new, absolutely new and beautiful for me.  I lost everything and started to appreciate it.  Sometimes I thoughtlessly stood in a minibus without the possibility even to release at least one hand and sweetly recalled how on such days I could enjoy music in a player.  I remember how I wanted to chat on long-distance and close friends on VKontakte, to arrange a meeting. <br><br>  A week before the first lecture, I already knew the material.  A week before the third I knew the material of the entire course.  When I had nothing to do after the lessons were done, I began to dig additional literature.  In order not to talk about it, I will say that I have read more than 5 books in an assembler, a hell of an extensive language for understanding.  I received a share of satisfaction from this because I saw how with each hour I soar above my former self, I liked to read, and besides, I became much calmer.  At times, I terribly wanted to abandon it, but I walked to the end.  I didn‚Äôt speak friendly with teachers, all the answers were dry and memorized, but they were correct from beginning to end. <br><br>  I was equivalent to the word worker.  I had to work for 7-8 hours at the computer, and naturally after 4 hours I was not talking about creative work.  There was only one subject that I did not teach.  He was left as a control, in order to check whether the guy at number one had to pass this item without knowledge.  By the middle of the semester, my nervous system was bloody hellishly shaken, but I became much smarter with the job that they were giving me and the tasks became easier and easier.  By the end of the semester, I had 5 subjects closed at the maximum score of 100. The rest were fives and another three.  I think you guessed on what exactly the subject. <br><br><h1>  Semester two.  A life? <br></h1><br>  During the winter holidays, I just slept.  At times, I would get up to change the slobbering pillow, this was where my activity ended.  And I did it not because I was tired, but because I was preparing for the second part of the experience.  I felt that something terrible was coming, but I still didn‚Äôt know what. <br><br>  So, a week before class, I looked at Dexter, House, a couple of missed series of Friends, started the Sopranos.  Over the entire semester, I reviewed more than 120 films, they were all from the top 250 film searches (I had long wanted to review them all) and did not continue to listen to music.  He stopped at a friend's quote ‚ÄúThose who are afraid to think listen to music.‚Äù  Just struck her out of life.  Perhaps this is the only experience gained after the first semester. <br>  - I began to catch up with the spree with friends, climbed a bunch of cafes and breweries, became an expert in dark beers and pizzas (that was a heightened stepuh), <br>  - He began to follow the face more carefully than Patrick Bateman, learned to draw. <br>  - I started reading Habr, a couple of LJ and blogs, a couple of entertainment portals + friends threw up content from closed communities.  - Sat down on flash drives and YouTube. <br><br>  But I did not read fiction.  I had to much more difficult than in the first semester, if only because there is nothing to DO.  Just a vacuum of action.  I have a lot of really interesting lessons for me, but I could not bring them into the experiment. <br><br>  After some time, a vacuum was also discovered in my head, although the teachers did not want to notice it at all.  Sometimes I come to one of the young teachers and talk about the release of new products or with the elderly about new standards in cryptography, guided only by the articles read on Habr√© and they are changing before their eyes.  The interest in new products impresses them much more than any literature, even more.  What they do not know, in my mouth was manna from heaven.  I do not know why.  Maybe they were all the first guys and they are tired of these networks.  I was on friendly terms literally with all the teachers and met a very very large number of students, the only thing I am glad of.  Before the exam, I simply took the answers from one of them and just left.  An unpleasant feeling and at the same time this is what I was waiting for.  Girls flirted with me, teachers loved me, I had friends and many acquaintances, I had a student life.  So I imagined her, except that I did not study during the session.  The day after tomorrow I will have another exam.  I don‚Äôt worry at all - I don‚Äôt know anything.  This semester, without my intervention, I was offered 4 jobs and 2 scientific papers.  In the past 0. I am once again an excellent student (one four), I feel great and dream to get away from the computer and the daily 1000+ in the reader. <br><br><h1>  Conclusion. <br></h1><br>  For myself, I made a couple of key conclusions, and I am confident in their correctness: <br><ol><li>  I do not go to the magistracy.  No, in this mess I do not want to stew </li><li>  Everything is good in moderation, and now this measure has been experienced by me personally for me.  For each, it has its own. </li><li>  I adore my hobbies!  I really miss them.  My dream is to do what I love and make a profitable business out of it.  For a student, there is nothing worse than doing what you don‚Äôt like. </li><li>  Physical fitness is very important.  If at the beginning of autumn I could pull myself up 20 times, I couldn‚Äôt go to winter, and 10. It‚Äôs impossible to throw. </li><li>  All that surrounds you is you.  You can not neglect this. </li><li>  Teachers?  Teachers?  No, they are not to blame.  Blame the system.  Globally fight in any way locally can be elementary.  Just let them know that they are people too.  Be sincere with them, and you will be back a hundredfold. </li></ol><br><br>  And further <br>  During the experiment, no one was hurt. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97163/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97163/</a></p>
