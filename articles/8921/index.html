  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Design Calendar</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Charging box <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e57/c50/9d5/e57c509d55d48212987c7292a3c72ba5.jpg"></a>  The German association of young designers from Germany, Ding 3000 (it includes Sven Rudolph, Carsten Schelling and Ralph Webermann) is known for giving new things to familiar things and immersing them in a different context.  Among the previous high-profile works is a lamp in the form of an illuminated architectural cornice, just not of plaster, but of acrylic glass and foam.  The new invention looks much more modest, but its purpose is as wide as possible.  This is a stand-box SL 12 Charge Box for recharging electronic devices.  Phones, digital cameras, players usually form an unpleasant tangle of colored wires.  In the case of this box, they are all neatly placed inside and do not spoil the interior (inside the extension is placed).  The dimensions of this metal device with a padded padded cover are 30 cm x 20 cm. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  "Human touch" <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/df8/dea/446/df8dea446736172cbb4ee28b544196e2.jpg"></a>  The Human Touch exhibition (originally Human Touch) continues to travel the world.  The next stop is in New Zealand.  The exhibition is organized by the Dutch company Droog and demonstrates more than 50 items from its own collection, created by 40 designers in recent years.  The goal is to explore how people interact with objects of different purposes, be it a bench, a tumble dryer or a cupboard.  The subject of touch for Droog is extremely important.  Their objects are often made of coarse materials (the bench can be just a trunk with bark, where the backs are installed from different seats), or from technological ones, such as silicone and different gels, the interaction with which gives rise to opposite sensations.  This mobile exhibition was timed to the opening of the New Dowse Museum - for several years it was closed for renovation.  The exhibition will be open until mid-April, from where it will move to Jakarta. <br><br>  European Designer 2007 <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7a9/e73/fe7/7a9e73fe7e2512b6417421aa4d2bf305.jpg"></a>  The beginning of the year has already determined who is the chief designer of Europe for this year.  This is Konstantin Grcic, who broke all records of participation in international exhibitions and was invited at once by several organizations as a guest of honor.  In Paris, at one of the most significant shows of Maison &amp; Objet, he was announced the designer of the year.  In Stockholm, this designer from Munich was assigned to arrange the central and most visited spaces of the furniture exhibition - in particular, the guest lounge.  Grchich makes light, intelligible objects, often exposing their design - from the chair can leave one skeleton.  These are verified things, close to the classic designs of the beginning of the century.  Probably, such a unanimous choice of the public means that everyone is tired of decorations and fashion.

      With foot care <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/936/88f/992/93688f992ac23ef843fb00e574ce34e5.jpg"></a>  Just imagine that you have a small computer in each shoe that determines whether it is comfortable for your legs and whether every single part springs well ‚Äî whether in a toe, in the heel, or at the arch of the foot.  In addition, the foot cares about the foot, not only at the moment when you put it on, but during the whole hike-run-jump - and regulates it through special magnetic sensors.  That is, if the legs are slightly swollen, the system will adjust the sneakers in such a way that will relieve the pressure of the pads from the inside - you will not even need to untie the shoes.  Is this not a paradise for athletes? To race over long distances and hiking in the mountains, the doctor has just prescribed such shoes.  Such adorable sneakers were made by Adidas - and it seems the future is behind such shoes. <br><br>  Concrete to the light <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/388/996/d40/388996d403197679daf832ae0e16a0d5.jpg"></a>  Modern architecture and concrete are synonymous terms.  He is subject to any form and design.  It can be argued that it was he who helped become famous stars of modern architecture, giving their fantasies a concrete (difficult to resist a pun) incarnation.  In recent years, experiments have led to a number of innovative solutions that promise, if not to change the purpose of concrete, to significantly expand its capabilities.  Several companies set out to turn it into a romantic material, to get rid of traditional rigidity and brutality.  LiTraCon began to produce translucent illuminated concrete called LiTraCon (Light-Transmitting Concrete).  This innovative material (designed by Arona Losonzhi) consists of glass optical fiber and ordinary concrete.  The main idea is to find a combination of these two materials, in which the wall begins to glow.  This is due to the thousands of concrete penetrating parallel fibers.  The surface of such a concrete slab does not differ from standard concrete, and only in the light it can be seen that the wall is non-uniform, and in those places where there is an optical fiber, the material seems to be lit from the inside. <br><br>  All dogs do it <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4c8/0ba/bf2/4c80babf21ccee8268dea8853a8c4d5f.jpg"></a>  The urban environment is becoming a more intense subject of concern from designers.  The company Bruco Swiss has developed special containers in which there are garbage bags.  Strictly speaking, for the well-defined garbage that appears on the streets whenever city residents walk their dogs.  So that the forgetful owners do not refer to the lack of suitable means at the moment to clean up after the dog, the city authorities are going to introduce such boxes, from where it is easy to get a package.  The boxes are made of stainless steel - it will not be easy to break them.  They are attached to the wall, fence or mounted on metal supports. <br>  <a href="http://archvestnik.ru/">Magazine: Architectural Gazette</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/8921/">https://habr.com/ru/post/8921/</a></p>
