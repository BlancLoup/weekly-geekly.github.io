These presentations were extremely important for drawing attention to the project, and often acted as a stimulating factor for receiving additional donations. <br><br>  This year, having conducted a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/135718/">small experiment</a> and inspired by <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/142978/">other</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/140180/">success</a> stories, we decided to do something different, much more ambitious.  Currently, ReactOS is closer than ever to the transition to the beta testing stage, and we are constantly improving the development process itself.  However, for most of our core developers, ReactOS is just a hobby in which they are busy in their free time, because in real life we ‚Äã‚Äãall have a lot of our own business and daily duties.  All our developers are extremely qualified and any input they make to the project is invaluable for the development of the project.

      For the first time in its existence, the ReactOS Foundation decided to go beyond the usual fund-raising campaigns to pay for infrastructure maintenance costs.  We want <a href="http://www.reactos.org/ru/foundation_donate.html">to collect donations</a> and <b>formally hire as many of our core developers as possible</b> for this money, thereby ensuring that they can fully work on the project they have been believing in and have been participating for a long time, and the project will turn for them hobby in work. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Taking into account the significant achievements of the project, obtained in the course of Google Summer of 2011, it becomes even more obvious that the most effective way to accelerate the development of ReactOS is direct funding for developers.  In this regard, the project would like to appeal to our supporters and everyone who believes in us, with a request to help in carrying out this campaign.  Together, we can make ReactOS a competitive alternative operating system for computer users around the world. <br><br>  PS We also need help in improving the project documentation.  Therefore, we also invite the cooperation of talented students (or graduate students) who are well-versed in economics and marketing research and who wish to write a scientific work, solving real world project problems.  We guarantee close contact with developers and personally with Alexey Bragin. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143037/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143037/</a></p>
