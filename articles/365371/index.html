Moreover, it turned out that the ‚Äúideal wallet‚Äù theme even became an <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/stories/wallets">object of research</a> - why do people even take on creativity in this area?  And, as it turned out, the basis of these surveys is a very simple fact - absolutely everyone is dissatisfied with his wallet.  How and what can be improved - let's see together with startups. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1917279759/clover-wallet-relaunch%3Fref%3Ddiscovery">Clover</a> - aluminum cardholder: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b1/507/737/9b150773722849409c930ccf592ca9b2.png">

      Card compartment, almost non-stretching bundle for clamping banknotes and key holder for eight keys.  All in anodized aluminum housing.  Convenient, practical and technologically.  Hi-tech style in your pocket.  For only $ 38. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/scene3/recycled-skateboard-slim-wallet%3Fref%3Ddiscovery">Skateboard Slim Wallet</a> - cardholder for extreme sports: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c0f/a33/2a2/c0fa332a26b143048de584d556fcc5b6.png"><br><br>  There are such people - skateboarders, snowboarders and other surfers who need few things in life.  Board - without fail.  Well, if a wallet is also made from the blackboard and the blackboard, then that is probably all.  For complete happiness you need to pay only $ 50 - for two mini-decks. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1753479860/tribe-ultralight-the-wallet-of-the-future%3Fref%3Ddiscovery">Tribe UltraLight</a> - the wallet of the future: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/586/1b6/86e/5861b686e2fe4312afecb181dcb636c1.png"><br><br>  Loudly said, but in fact - two plates and a stinging harness.  Yes, plates of your choice from the most technologically advanced materials: carbon, titanium, and TEXALIUM - molded fiberglass fibers coated with aluminum.  Prices for high-tech - from $ 55 to $ 75. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/266206745/clipcase-truly-unique-wallet/description">Clipcase</a> - perfectionists wallet: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d41/769/851/d41769851b1a41be89284f7f3c5e4abb.png"><br><br>  See what's in your wallet?  Money, cards and a lot of everything else, not very clear destination?  It can be put in order once and for all; the only way is to get rid of it.  And in return, order a Clipcase like this, where there is simply no place for anything extra physically.  Only for $ 50 with several colored harnesses. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bullettrainsf/safe-wallet-case-for-iphone-6simplify-your-everyda%3Fref%3Ddiscovery">SAFE Wallet Case for iPhone 6</a> - <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bullettrainsf/safe-wallet-case-for-iphone-6simplify-your-everyda%3Fref%3Ddiscovery">Wallet Case for</a> iPhone 6: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e62/386/b52/e62386b5232b4ac1affee0d804f23802.png"><br><br>  Everything is great and good: here is a case for an expensive device, here is a card compartment, for business cards, a clip for bills.  The only problem - if you lose or steal, God forbid, then all at once.  And iPhone, and money with cards.  In one day and so many problems.  For $ 59 for thrill-seekers. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2143715323/the-instant-wallet-the-unique-3-in-1-modular-walle/description">The Instant Wallet</a> - modular wallet: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/65e/a3d/a05/65ea3da059b4480c901dc4abde1522bf.png"><br><br>  Immediately obvious - the French took the case.  Modular wallet in the best traditions of Louis Vuitton and the company.  High-quality leather, perfect cut in three components - a pocket for small items with a zipper, a cardholder and the purse itself.  One element complements the other.  And all together - $ 110. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2109735656/synergos-wallet-a-mashup-of-carrying-simplicity/description">SYNERGOS</a> - cardholder with drive: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7d6/408/179/7d640817977848139299e9efca3b2c77.png"><br><br>  Another variation on the subject of a thin aluminum cardholder in the best traditions of modern minimalism.  But with a twist in the form of a USB-drive up to 64 GB.  Convenient and practical for those who are always in the process.  Model cost - $ 50 in the maximum configuration. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1396900125/aj-wallet-think-quality/description">AJ-Wallet</a> - purse with an opener: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad1/96b/6f0/ad196b6f05124cc88bba89a73304333f.png"><br><br>  It is clear that a purse with an opener for beer bottles could come up with just ... who?  That's right, the British.  Leather, contrasting stitching, anodized aluminum and steel are all stylish, rich and very practical.  What other USB drive?  Here is a beer opener - yes, this is a necessary thing.  Prices for the "miracle" - from 29 pounds. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/625059603/paperwallet-a-super-thin-tyvek-wallet-designed-by/description">Paperwallet</a> - a purse from Tyvek: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b1/259/212/7b125921238d494ca04828d56eee1f1d.png"><br><br>  Chip last year - designer purses made of paper tyvek.  Strong, not passing water and keeping presentable appearance during a year minimum, and at the most active use.  And if you add that the images for these wallets were provided by the most eminent designers of the world - from Wei Wei and Gelado studio to Yamazaki and Monroe, then you will want to pay for an ultra-thin case again and again.  You can do it <a href="http://www.paperwallet.com/">here</a> today. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/150007960/the-multi-the-first-multi-tool-wallet/description">The MULTI</a> - cardholder multitool: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e0a/1e1/a50/e0a1e1a501994d018c93cd1481fd5d7d.png"><br><br>  A great option for DIY and those who love everything to be at hand.  Twist-twist, open-pry and so on - with such a cardholder from any situation you get through without any problems.  Variants of application weight.  And for only $ 45. <br><br>  As you can see, the function of storing money and cards in modern wallets is successfully complemented by completely utilitarian devices of a different plan, so that you can find something of your own without problems.  But losing more and more difficult - many of the presented cardholders are equipped with RFID sensors, however, they do not work with us yet. <br><br> <a href="http://litemf.com/ru/price"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/684/07e/15e/68407e15e5c2497a9ca17c6abca7b764.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365371/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365371/</a></p>
