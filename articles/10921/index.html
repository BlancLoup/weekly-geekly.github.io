On the very first day, security experts discovered 18 errors.  Upgrading the program to version 3.0.1 did not save most critical errors.  For example, the text in bold is not displayed;  when working with bookmarks, as well as when the AutoFill function is on, the browser displays an error message and is turned off.  In two days, the browser downloaded a million times. <br><br>  2. <strong>Growth in the number of mobile subscribers in Russia and Ukraine.</strong>  The total number of cellular subscribers in Russia reached 158.52 million people, which is 1% higher than the previous month.
