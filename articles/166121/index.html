  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is more advantageous to contests than direct advertising, or how we came up with a contest for diafan.CMS</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It's no secret why contests are held.  Of course, this is a type of advertising, and often in the form of a competition, it is more effective than the classical advertising of direct exposure.  Because, firstly, the advertiser is relatively inexpensive: only a prize fund is needed.  Secondly, the public response is higher and the attention of the target audience is more intent.  And for online contests, there is also a benefit that traces will remain after the contest, which will give additional returns for a long time.  At least that's how it seemed to us when we decided to hold a competition.  Is it really - time will tell. <br><br>  I‚Äôll say right away that we haven‚Äôt conducted any competitions before; this is our first experience.  Although online advertising used and used all.  And what is interesting is that there is a lot of information in the network about how to start this or that kind of traditional advertising, but you will not find the guidelines for the competition.  Therefore, we organized the competition from scratch.  And on the background of the fact that we have been advertising on the Internet for a long time, we will have something to compare with.  We will tell about everything below. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Internet advertising </h2>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      So, we have a product - diafan.CMS site management system.  And the product is not bad, the users are satisfied, the partners are happy and do not refuse us over time.  All users recommend us to friends and colleagues.  And we are glad that we have made such a good engine and rightly want to increase our market share.  How to do it?  Of course, we need to advertise, which we do.  But shooting sparrows from a cannon, advertised on the Yandex main page, is completely reluctant, so we are looking for a balance of minimum budget expenditure and maximum efficiency. <br><br>  To complete the picture, as well as to make this post useful for those who are going to advertise on the Internet, I‚Äôll tell you what we use: <br><br>  <b>1. Social networks</b> ... It's free, if we talk about the participants and repost.  Perhaps we are not yet tight or properly engaged in this advertising channel, but we see little sense in social networks.  Maybe this is due to the specifics of our product, but most of the participants in our social network groups are those who are already our user. <br><br>  <b>2. Advertising on specialized forums</b> : banners, posting topics.  The cost of about 5,000 rubles per month for one forum.  In general, the exhaust is very weak, traffic to our site grows slightly, targeted user registrations and sales do not increase much. <br><br>  <b>3. Banner and blocks on profile services for webmasters</b> , such as pr-cy.  The price is small, 5000-10000 rubles per month.  The result is good: dozens of transitions per day, registration. <br><br>  <b>4. Advertising on mass-attended IT sites</b> , such as Habra and similar ones.  About 10,000 rubles per month for the site.  Banner advertising, plus publication.  Publications give good attendance jumps, better known as habraeffect :).  Instant sales and registrations do not grow much, but in general, such advertising works well. <br><br>  <b>5. Contextual advertising</b> .  Yandex.Direct, AdSense, Runner.  In general, search advertising on the Internet is unlikely to ever surrender positions - this is effective.  We use, enjoyed and will have to use.  The budget for our keywords is small, about 20,000 rubles a month.  Return, attendance and registration is. <br><br>  <b>6. Mediatarget allocate a</b> separate item advertising in this network.  It can be used as a contextual (for search phrases), there and in a regular mode on indirectly-themed webmasters, such as liveinternet.ru.  It gives a good effect with relatively small money.  We put a limit of 1000 rubles per day, i.e.  30,000 per month, but the site allows you to spend much more. <br><br>  <b>7. Banner advertising on the whole RuNet</b> - <b>pop</b> -ups, raskhlop, ricmedia, etc., across the webmaster audience.  A bright representative of the sales of such advertising is the operator Soloway.  Not very expensive for our topic, within 35000-40000 rubles per month.  Very massively, but not particularly effective. <br><br>  <b>8. Banners on themed sites about CMS</b> , such as cmslist or cmsmagazine.  CMSlist is very weak, but the block above the rating in CMSmagazine is normal, there are transitions, there are registrations.  The cost of the order of 40,000 rubles per month. <br><br>  <b>9. Sponsorship</b> .  All kinds of events like RIF + KiB, offline IT magazines, tagline sites.  Instant near-zero effect.  However, at the end of the year, plus is also not seen.  Single transitions per month with 100% rejections.  And expensive, 50,000, 100,000 rubles per month and above. <br><br>  The trouble with any classic advertising is that it only externally shows the advertised product, and has no feedback from the consumer.  In addition, the classic advertising "climbs on the eyes" as long as you pay for it.  And many users have long been immune to advertising, they have learned to simply ignore banners and other advertising stars.  And for greater efficiency, it is necessary that a potential user not only notice, but also try the product in action, discuss it with other participants, share it with friends.  Here we have to help the competition with its motivation. <br><br><h2>  Competition </h2><br><br>  The effectiveness of the competition is not yet known to us, but we assume that this will be the most effective.  According to the results of the competition, we will additionally report. <br><br>  In organizing the competition, we took the baseline data for the average figures of the above: the budget is about 45,000 rubles and the duration of the month. <br><br>  Our task is that after the announcement of the competition and the initial call of the public to participate, word of mouth should work.  For this to happen, people must have a reason, that is, the competition must be very tempting. <br><br><h3>  We derive the rules of a good competition </h3><br><br>  With a total of 45,000 rubles, you can afford to establish a very decent prize for the contestants.  Since our audience is all webmasters creating websites on boxed CMS, the prize could be, for example, a candy bar or a good laptop.  You can make just ‚Ç¨ 1000.  But then there is a risk that there will be many dissatisfied, if there are several equivalent works that claim to win, and only one receives a prize.  Therefore, we suggested that it is better to make several equal prizes simpler than one expensive, so that the winners could be called not one, but several people.  And the prize is needed more universally, so that if not for yourself, then ‚Äúgive mother‚Äù.  For example, tablets.  This will be the rule of a good competition number 1: <b>it is better to have more prizes with smaller prizes than vice versa.</b> <br><br>  What else do you need to ensure that as many people as possible take part in the competition?  Obviously, whatever the valuable prize, it makes no sense to ask people to fulfill the mega-task.  There are no fools, and few people will plow just for the chance to get a prize, even if it is a good one.  And since the goal of the competition is to attract attention and involve as many people as possible, the task should be quite trifling, literally at the level of entertainment.  We derive the rule of a good contest ‚Ññ2: an <b>easy task</b> <br><br>  Whatever the simple task of the competition - it's still work and time spent.  And receiving prizes is not a guarantee, but only a chance.  Therefore, it is perfectly logical that people will be much more willing to participate in a win-win competition, where there is guaranteed to be a ‚Äúcomforting‚Äù prize for any place.  It turns out rule number 3: <b>all participants must have a benefit from the competition</b> . <br><br>  Even if there are consolation prizes, the contestants will still strive to take the main places.  And no one likes fake contests, where unknown participants take the first places, with names similar to bots.  Especially often this happens when the winners are determined by the jury.  But you can not refuse the jury, because then there will only be a user vote.  And this is even worse, because who has the better script, he won.  Therefore, the rules need to clearly discuss how and by what principle the leaders will be identified.  That is, the rule of good competition No. 4 is the <b>principal and maximum transparency in determining the winners</b> . <br><br><h3>  What happened </h3><br><br>  What we have, you can evaluate yourself.  According to these rules, we organized our <a href="http://cms.diafan.ru/konkurs/">contest for webmasters</a> .  In short, we offer all web developers to try our <a href="http://cms.diafan.ru/">diafan.CMS</a> in action, and get into the prizes.  The guaranteed prize is a license for diafan.CMS, as well as additional experience, knowledge and skills that will not go anywhere from you.  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/166121/">https://habr.com/ru/post/166121/</a></p>
