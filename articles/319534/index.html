      But this does not end there!  By awarding the top three winners with class prizes, we also select some of the best participants and invite them along with the winners to the eight-hour <b>hackquest</b> as part of the ‚Äúface-to-face‚Äù NeoQUEST, which traditionally takes place in the summer in St. Petersburg during the white nights. <br><br>  <b>"Face to face"</b> - an open event, which can attend all who: <br><br><ul><li>  wants to hear reports on current issues in the field of information security; </li><li>  eager to take part in fun contests for "hacking" ("hacking" of what? Yes, anything, starting from WiFi and ending with a "smart" light bulb); </li><li>  wants to see real-time demonstrations of attacks on various security mechanisms; </li><li>  likes to sit in a corner with a laptop, solving an online quiz on <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoquestSupport">Twitter</a> ; </li><li>  just wants to have a great time with colleagues and like-minded people. </li></ul><br>  Throughout the day, guests of the ‚Äúconfrontation‚Äù will not only learn new things, but also receive small prizes!  The result of the evening is the announcement of the hackquest results and awarding the winner with the main prize: a <b>trip to one of the international conferences on cybersecurity (at the participant's choice)</b> . <br><br><h2>  <b>Legend of NeoQUEST-2017</b> </h2><br>  Each NeoQUEST is accompanied by a fascinating legend.  You already escaped from prison, wandered through the labyrinths of the St. Petersburg subway in search of a secret bunker, was initiated into the fraternity of masons, was a policeman or a dangerous mafia?  It's time to expand the horizons! <br><br>  At NeoQUEST-2017 you will find an expedition to the vast expanses of space as part of a research expedition.  Be sure, without extreme tests and development of unknown planets will not do. <br><br><h2>  <b>Tasks NeoQUEST-2017</b> </h2><br>  All tasks NeoQUEST have a different level of complexity, so it makes sense to take part in everything: from beginners to experienced ctf-ps with experience!  However, we remind you that NeoQUEST is an <b>individual</b> , not a team competition. <br><br>  Good news for lovers of ‚Äúapple devices‚Äù: this year, doing a task related to the security of mobile devices, we decided not to limit ourselves to Android, and for the first time came up with a task for iOS! <br><br>  In addition, participants are waiting for tasks on: <br><br><ul><li>  reverse engineering; </li><li>  cryptography; </li><li>  virtualization; </li><li>  network and Web security; </li><li>  search and exploit vulnerabilities and much more. </li></ul><br>  Points for tasks are awarded in accordance with the dynamic scale: the ‚Äúcost‚Äù of the task is determined by the number of participants who passed it, as well as the time of passing - the participant who completed the task first gets 10 additional points, the second - 9 points, and so on.  In one task there can be several keys, for each key points are awarded separately. <br><br><h2>  <b>Cosmos is waiting for its hero!</b> </h2><br>  In addition to the prizes, the best participants of NeoQUEST rely on the ‚Äúeducational‚Äù bonus: their success in the competition is taken into account when they enroll in the magistracy and graduate school at the Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãSecurity Division of Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University! <br><br>  For all questions related to NeoQUEST, write to <b>support@neoquest.ru</b> .  Follow the quest and find out the latest news in our <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoquestSupport">twitter</a> and on the <a href="http://neoquest.ru/">official website</a> . <br><br>  NeoQUEST is your chance to try yourself in the role of a cybersecurity expert, learn many new things and become the owner of great prizes!  <a href="http://2017.neoquest.ru/">Register</a> , and forward - surf the space cyberspace! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/319534/">https://habr.com/ru/post/319534/</a></p>
