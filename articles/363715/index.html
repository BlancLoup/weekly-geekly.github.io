    <h4>  Currency markets </h4><br>  In Russia, the past week was remembered by the fact that the national currency (ruble) established historical anti-records, <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/finance/news/36603271/evro-prevysil-619-rublya-na-otkrytii-torgov">having fallen</a> below 50 rubles per dollar and 62 rubles per euro in exchange trading.  (With the beginning of the new week, the situation only <a href="https://meduza.io/news/2014/12/01/kurs-evro-tsb-rf-vyros-na-tri-rublya">worsened</a> and the ruble fell even more - in the afternoon at the exchange trading for the euro gave 65.29 rubles, for the dollar - 52.39 rubles) <br><br>  The fall of the ruble was due to the collapse of world oil prices after the organization of oil exporting countries OPEC decided not to reduce the quota for oil production (30 million barrels per day, valid since 2011). <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/19pZ1c2qBnY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhilHtxld4Vo_YgP7fKGCicFwfAyVQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  After the announcement of the decision, oil prices collapsed by almost 6% - below $ 71.5. <br><br>  The chief economist of ITinvest Sergey Egishyants <a href="http://www.itinvest.ru/analytics/reviews/world-markets/8485/">comments on the</a> situation with the weakening of the Russian currency in his analytical material: <br><br><blockquote>  The ruble was twitching with a hefty amplitude - as we expected, this is the most obvious consequence of leaving the Bank of Russia market: the segment itself is rather poorly liquid - therefore the ‚Äúinvisible hand‚Äù is able to drive it back and forth rather far, including the most minor reasons.  After the OPEC meeting, the ruble collapsed to new lows - having met with a full understanding of the central bank. <br><br>  This does not prevent the authorities to praise themselves for their wisdom and insight - so the Bank of Russia clown Ksenia Yudaeva once again extinguished the people with a proud statement that de floating ruble creates conditions for economic growth and takes on "numerous real shocks": how is that?  - so far this swimming shocks only creates, at the same time depriving the business of the possibility of long-term planning of currency risks. </blockquote><br>  Some experts predict further lower prices for "black gold".  So the president of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, <a href="http://ru.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idRUKCN0JC08P20141128">said</a> that by mid-2015, oil could become cheaper by up to $ 60 per barrel (ITinvest expert Dmitry Solodin told about the <a href="http://www.itinvest.ru/analytics/reviews/idea/8486/">attractiveness of</a> the company's <a href="http://www.itinvest.ru/analytics/reviews/idea/8486/">shares</a> for purchase).  This means that the ruble has significant potential for impairment - up to 60 rubles per dollar. <br><br>  <b>See also: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/itinvest/blog/241595/">What to invest your finances in terms of the devaluation of the ruble</a></b> <br><br>  Representatives of the authorities are not so pessimistic, although they also do not radiate excessive optimism - Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov <a href="http://top.rbc.ru/economics/26/11/2014/54758f17cbb20f7c6e14a537">admitted</a> that the fall in oil prices may be ‚Äúnot a short-term phenomenon,‚Äù and the price at $ 80‚Äì90 / bbl.  may persist in the medium and even long term <br><br><h4>  Stock markets </h4><br>  The RTS index <a href="http://www.mk.ru/economics/2014/11/28/indeks-rts-upal-do-minimuma-s-iyulya-2009-goda.html">fell</a> by 3.7% to a minimum since July 2009.  Then his level was 969.79 points.  The situation with the MVVB (MICEX) index was no better: the opening of trading on the Moscow Exchange on Friday fell by 0.5% to 1,523.54 points. <br><br>  On Monday, during the first 10 minutes of trading, the RTS index <a href="http://slon.ru/fast/economics/indeks-rts-za-10-minut-rukhnul-na-4-1189932.xhtml">collapsed by</a> more than 4% to 933 points.  At the same time, the MICEX index rose slightly - by 0.15% to 1,535 points. <br><br>  The domestic stock market was discussing another news - on November 28, the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange <a href="http://www.itinvest.ru/about/news/683026/">launched</a> trading in securities of foreign companies on the S &amp; P 500 list - here, Apple, Google, and Facebook, as well as many famous technology companies. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/opTd34dgdoQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhl2fTu-GWBD2Y6csKni3dS6jl3jA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  You can get the opportunity to purchase shares of technology giants through ITinvest - for this you need <a href="http://www.itinvest.ru/services/markets/spb-exchange/">to leave a request</a> on the site. <br><br>  Sergey Egishyants described the situation on foreign stock markets: <br><br><blockquote>  Leading stock exchanges continue to grow slowly - Nasdak‚Äôs goals (and these are the peaks of 2000) are now less than 10%, Dow is even closer;  the key papers are also close to the finish (so Apple seems to go to 140-150, and already 120) - finally, the Dow's volatility on dyvka is approaching critically low values ‚Äã‚Äã(0.2-0.3 for a 20-day indicator).  However, the Nikkei seems to be far away (maybe even 20,000) - but everything else indicates that the market highs will be reached this winter, and then a long-term reversal will follow, although not immediately: after half a year, the base of the subsequent recession will slowly be laid down, lagging behind and may catch up and finish their goals.  By the way, the Shanghai Stock Exchange climbed to the top in 3 years - despite the obvious slowdown in the PRC economy: it is clear that the markets are completely divorced from the realities of the surrounding life - and this never ends well anywhere. <br><br>  The reporting season is close to the finish line - at the end, Hewlett-Packard spoke gloomily: profits are about expectations, but revenues are weaker than them ‚Äî just like winter forecasts.  We also note the British Mail (Royal Mail), in which both revenue and profit have fallen - however, everyone agrees that this organization‚Äôs annual results will almost completely determine the activity of customers in the upcoming holiday season.  Banks have already reported for a long time - they have the best revenue growth in 5 years and not weak jump in profits;  at the same time, however, the interest margin is the worst in 25 years - in other words, recently the lenders allegedly earn money not on loans, but on speculations and commissions - which will sharply collapse when the crisis resumes, because markets will collapse, and the IPO and mergers and acquisitions will less by orders of magnitude.  Apple wrote a fresh fine for the Americans, for colluding with the largest publishers, which allowed the prices of e-books to go up: the Yabloks, however, are not eager to pay the 450 million bucks assigned to them - they filed an appeal. </blockquote><br>  That's all, thank you for your attention.
