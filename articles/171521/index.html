  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Maptrix geolocation application: developer explanation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, there are many geolocation applications on the market designed for iOS and Android gadgets.  However, to date, none of the most common could not boast of the wide possibilities of working in the online mode.  Maptrix fills this gap by combining the functions of a geolocation application and a social network.  In this review, we will talk about what "forks" were completed when creating the application. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  <b>Tasks and functions of the application</b> </h5><br>  We conceived Maptrix primarily as an application that allows the user to track online the movement of his friends in space (the application is synchronized with Vkontakte, Facebook, Twitter, My World, Classmates).  For this, in addition to the typical ‚Äúcheck in‚Äù service of analogs, other methods of determining the location of people are used - fixation relative to cell towers and search by GPS coordinates.

      The second task of the application, we have identified a significant simplification of meeting new people.  The user can start a conversation with any person "lit up" on the map (for example, at a nearby entrance or at a nearby table in a cafe), including an unfamiliar person.  In addition, it is possible to chat in any institution, thus making new acquaintances through Maptrix in a club, gym or library. <br><br>  Finally, the third functional layer of Maptrix is ‚Äã‚Äãalready familiar features of geolocation service.  A kind of ‚Äúmust have‚Äù for any similar application - namely, the ability to search places, rate them, post your photos and reviews, view photos and read reviews from other users. <br><br><h5>  People on the map </h5><br>  Having defined the functionality of the application, we immediately realized that several blocks were to be created: a map (Google maps were used in Maptrix), places (with the ability to search and partition by rubricators) and chats.  Chats as a tool of communication, we identified immediately - this function corresponds to the two main tasks of Maptrix, and today it is one of the main differences of the application from its counterparts. <br><br>  Actually, the next step was to determine the mechanism of adding to the card those with whom you can chat in the chat ‚Äî that is, other users of the application.  We looked at how this was done in such applications and decided to act ‚Äúfrom the opposite‚Äù - in line with an open friend-policy, and this is also a serious difference of Maptrix.  In our application, the user does not need to re-add his ‚Äúsocial‚Äù friends, asking for their permission to add: the one who installed Maptrix is ‚Äã‚Äãalready there, and automatically it allows other people to see themselves and make contact. <br><br>  In addition, the user can see all the other people who are in Maptrix, even if they are not his ‚Äúfriends‚Äù on social networks.  Next - the question of personal choice: you can assign the application to show "all" or "only friends", and within each category - show "only boys" or "only girls". <br><br>  Of course, such a policy obliged us to ‚Äúscrew‚Äù the privacy settings to the application, as a result, the user can be incognito in Maptrix, remaining invisible to all or to certain people. <br><br><h5>  <b>User Profile</b> </h5><br>  Profile content is typical for this kind of applications.  The application allows you to upload a photo, specify a nickname, first name, last name, gender, date of birth, email address and phone number.  Also in the profile are displayed: <br>  - the so-called "achievements" of the user, which are assigned for a large number of marks in certain places, <br>  - the history of the marks (of the places where you were and noted) and the leaders in the "Chekin" for the last week; <br>  - photos posted by you. <br><br>  In addition, the profile can customize the behavior of the program.  First of all, we are talking about the already mentioned privacy settings (visible to all - visible only to friends - not visible to anyone - a list of friends who do not see me). <br><br>  Location setting is also important.  The user can choose whether to always locate when the gadget is on, or only when the application is running.  Also here you can allow using GPS only while Maptrix is ‚Äã‚Äãrunning or at any time. <br><br>  Also in profile: <br>  - binding to social networks is edited: if a user has several accounts in different social networks, it is possible to link everything; <br>  - it is possible to tell friends about the application and the opportunity to leave your profile, <br>  - You can customize the signal of various notifications (sound, vibration). <br><br><h5>  <b>Tab bar</b> </h5><br>  So, in the application there are two main entities - a person and a place.  When we decided on the architecture, it remains to distribute all this within the application.  Looking for the answer to the question ‚ÄúHow to do it?‚Äù, We considered several options. <br><br>  Option 1: do something like Foursquare.  Tab bar is located at the top, to move around the panel, both tapas and slide left and right are used.  However, this option was quickly abandoned.  At the core of our application is a map, it opens up first of all when entering Maptrix.  Considering this, it is impossible to move across the tab bar through flipping - in this case the map itself will shift.  In addition, the open question in this case was where to embed buttons like map settings, people search, event tracking, and so on. <br><br>  Option 2: follow the path of the VKontakte social network application, combining a very voluminous vertical tab bar with a horizontal one (implemented through slides, two functions are put on a separate panel at the top).  The option of flipping again did not go through, but even if you put it outside the brackets: Maptrix simply does not have so many menu items, therefore, using such a complex option would be unjustified. <br><br>  Option 3: Create a sophisticated tab bar, like the Path application.  Two functions brought up the application, the main part of the tab bar icons is located in the lower corner of the screen.  The panels are shaped like an arc, which pops up only when you click on the "plus sign".  It is in this ‚Äúarc‚Äù that the main functionality of the application is displayed - photos, a map, a diary and a number of others.  We recognized this solution as elegant, but not very convenient from the user's point of view. <br><br>  We stopped at option 4: use an absolutely traditional tab bar.  Now, entering the application, the user sees, first of all, a map and people on it.  Tab bar is located at the bottom, it is compact enough and does not require the use of a slide for work.  The user moves both around the panel and inside sections using tapes, the slide and panning is used exclusively for working with the map.  In the tab bar rendered map, places, chat rooms, people and profile. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c41/826/e42/c41826e42a9639243344e4bdaf7544f3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We know that some mobile application developers will find this solution obsolete.  However, given the functionality of the Maptrix application, we find it most convenient from the user's point of view. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/171521/">https://habr.com/ru/post/171521/</a></p>
