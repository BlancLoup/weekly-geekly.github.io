  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The first marketing activity in history. In the history of Ridewithme, of course</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this article, we look at the effectiveness of social media marketing, and a more adult version is the distribution of press releases. <br><br>  The first was decided to use Vkontakte advertising in two ways: <br><br>  - Advertising of the application in the news feed, this type of advertising appeared relatively recently, there were not many reports about its effectiveness, and we decided, as they say, to try it out for ourselves. <br>  - Advertising on the stock exchange advertising.  The essence of this channel is that communities put their advertising space and set a price.

      To test the advertising market, a budget was allocated for a test launch in the news feed, and in groups.  2/3 of the budget - allocated for targeting (advertising in the tape) and 1/3 for advertising in communities. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Next we bring to your attention the graphs of the use of advertising in the feed (Graph 1) and in the communities (Graphs 2) <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Schedule 1. Advertising in the tape.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dd8/558/baf/dd8558bafb8141c0b0fe1f1131ac8c35.jpg"><br>  On the graph: 171 transition advertising.  We received about 5 downloads in the same period. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Charts 2. Advertising in communities.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9f2/549/6dd/9f25496ddf9e4cd5a22728c90ed10f51.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c47/054/1d4/c470541d42114a2bb5c45705e80eec6f.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/021/72d/9cd/02172d9cd271444db624413b7c613fdf.jpg"><br>  On the charts: The total number of transitions was 67, while downloads during the promotional period exceeded 30. <br></div></div><br>  Conclusion: The advertisement in the tape did not justify itself and the funds invested in it, the advertisement in the groups showed more impressive results, considering the coefficient went-downloaded, we get 5/171 = 0.0292 and in groups 30/67 = 0.44.  For our application, advertising in communities turned out to be much more efficient than advertising in the news feed. <br><br>  So, the test was completed, the conclusions were made and it was time for a more adult version of user notification - Press release. <br>  There are a lot of offers for sending press releases in the network, most of them resembled two hours, but there are also literate services, but they are often paid, but the functionality offered by the same b2blogger is very attractive.  But, in the advertising budget, we were limited.  We settled on three free resources that have positive feedback on developer blogs.  Why three?  Because we didn‚Äôt pin big, ambitious hopes on the press release.  Anyway, it is clear to everyone that no one will undertake to print an article about us in a famous magazine or newspaper, for example, for free.  We were surprised when the next day a letter came to the post with a proposal from one small publication, it said that the editors were interested in our idea and would like to write a review about us.  The article has just appeared on their resource and it is still difficult to talk about the results, but for a free method, any interest from publications is already a result. <br>  A description of our idea in which there are callouts from the press release can be read here. <br>  First meeting with potential users. <br>  How it was. <br>  We needed photos for our website, and not only, such content is not superfluous.  In addition to the photos, it was decided to conduct a small marketing research among people who ride on anything and play anything. <br>  Beautiful day - we, with a camera tripod and stepladder (what kind of marketing research without a stepladder?) Went to VDNH. <br>  The sun, warmth, people who ride around with everything that has wheels - great!  And now, we are already meeting the users.  The mechanics are quite simple: we tell us who we are and why we are here, share an idea and listen to what people say about our project.  After this blitz survey, we offered to help us and participate in the installation of "how I use Ridewithme".  As was the case with the press release, we were pleasantly surprised, absolutely everyone liked the idea, not that we doubted, but we thought that we would meet someone who did not like our project.  One statement was remembered, of course, more than anyone.  The girl, let's call her Katya, said: ‚ÄúEh, where were you this morning?‚Äù.  It is a pity that we were still in development that morning. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Here are some photos of how it was.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4bd/3c0/16f/4bd3c016f1e448d8a88257979739e08d.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a52/54a/9e8/a5254a9e8e2c4b7c9664ea4294a29d11.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1cd/111/f4b/1cd111f4b01a469db85699caa4cc14af.jpg"><br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295398/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295398/</a></p>
