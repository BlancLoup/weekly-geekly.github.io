Alien invaders, called Uriks and looking exactly like the most ordinary human mustache, seek to enslave people and turn them into those who are unable to resist the performers of their will.  Whose side in this conflict will you choose?  Do you hurry to save the planet?  Or do you share with Uriks discontent regarding the current state of affairs on it?  Intel and Toshiba are introducing the new social thriller <a href="http://www.thepowerinside.com/">The Power Inside</a> .  Social means, and you, among other things, can take part in its creation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Social films (they could be justly called ‚ÄúFacebook‚Äù, because it was the social network named after M. Zuckerberg that became their main haven) - a logical and inevitable product of the Internet 2.0, which erased the line between content authors and consumers.  In their creation, an interested community plays an important role - it generates ideas, plot twists, images, and, of course, delivers actors.  In addition, sociality implies additional types of interactivity, for example, in the form of gaming or creative applications.  In short, a social film is a full-size virtual reality created by Internet users. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/rCuUBpTZE_U%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhieSNphucF-Nu2qCe3oCtHAqBrk3A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i><a href="http://youtu.be/rCuUBpTZE_U">Trailer for the</a> film "The Power Inside"</i> <br><br>  The first such film was released in 2011 and was called ‚ÄúHim, Her and Them‚Äù (‚ÄúHim, Her and Theirs‚Äù).  In the same year, the tandem of well-known companies Intel and Toshiba became interested in the idea.  Significantly increased budgets and innovative technologies allowed to bring the quality of video material to a fundamentally new, Hollywood level.  Famous American actors began to appear in the projects.  The first film under the auspices of Intel was the thriller "Inside" ("Inside") with Emmy Rossum in the title role.  Its plot is as follows.  Energetic girl Christina finds herself locked in a room - it is unknown who and why.  Its only connection to the outside world is a laptop and the disappearing Wi-Fi network.  Being on the other end of the network should help to understand what is happening.  The second film, ‚ÄúThe Beauty Inside‚Äù (‚ÄúInner Beauty‚Äù) was released in 2012. His main character, Alex, wakes up every morning in a new body, remaining internally the same - such a fantasy on the topic of ‚ÄúGroundhog Day‚Äù.  Together with the audience, he creates a holistic picture of his life, consisting of individual pieces.

This time the action takes place around the Nile - a loser of twenty-something years.  Neela is amazingly unlucky in life: he has a bad job, problems with his personal life and friends.  But these problems, as it turned out, are far from the greatest with which he will have to deal ... because the invading mustache has already been aimed at him. <br><br>  You choose for whose benefit you are creating creative.  If you decide to play for people, make a short video about how to shave off your mustache in protest (or otherwise get rid of them).  Fans of Uriks are invited to take a photo in which you, after a little refinement, will look like one of those infected with alien mustaches.  Your work may well enter the film or any materials about it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f5f/682/ce3/f5f682ce360f1a3d1918710b6dc3b4a7.jpg"><br>  <i>Frame from the film</i> <br><br>  The film will consist of six episodes;  the first was released on August 14, the second, as promised, will be presented to the audience tomorrow, the twenty-second.  In the intervals - discussion, interactive, contests and prize draws on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/insidefilms">the community page</a> on Facebook.  Well, then - new ideas, new films.  Who knows, maybe we are present at the birth of popular spectacles of the future?  At least, the series in their current understanding of social cinema can definitely move.  And this will be another victory for the Internet and virtual reality. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/190720/">https://habr.com/ru/post/190720/</a></p>
