Now there are several dozen of such services and the competition for the audience is truly huge. <br>  Today we will tell on the example of the most popular of them ( <a href="http://acars.ru/pdd/">acars.ru/pdd</a> ) and how this was achieved. <br><br>  Inside you will also find information on how to convince a user to register for your project.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>1. Design and usability</b> <br>  Tens of thousands of future drivers want to practice their skills every day and prepare for the traffic police exams.  But none of the services thought about the convenience of users.  All competing services are completely devoid of usability. <br><br>  Therefore, at first we decided to make tests simple.  To do this, we had to forget everything that is typical for web-design.  To <b>make a good interface</b> for tests, where there is a question and 3-4 answer choices - you need to essentially draw a terminal interface - too enlarged fonts, a choice of options similar to large buttons. <br> <a href="http://acars.ru/"><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4009/stasv.a/0_48f66_3a523dcf_XL"></a> <br><br>  <b>2. Understanding the purpose</b> <br>  In addition, the question arose ‚ÄúWhat to place on the ticket selection page?‚Äù.  After all, 40 numbers take up very little space. <br>  Then we climbed into the attendance statistics and found a curious thing - the official 40 tickets in the amount pass less than a randomly formed ticket, the link to which visually took up 40 times less space, was outside the first screen, and which we never paid attention to.  It turned out that it is important for people to simply get as many tickets as possible. <br><br>  <b>From this understanding 2 ideas were born:</b> <br>  - Allocate a random ticket 50% of the place placed on the main page <br>  - Give people the opportunity to answer questions until blue in the face <br><br> <a href="http://acars.ru/pdd/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dd9/812/386/dd981238690e94cb10295b4f51620b9c.png"></a> <br><br>  <b>3. Interest</b> <br>  Judging by the statistics, many users passed the tests once or twice.  Testing our service in the office, we came to the disappointing conclusion that passing the tests is not entertainment, but heavy duty.  And many times they pass only those who have to pass exams. <br><br>  Then we decided on the results of the tests to show people funny pictures and texts that depend on the results and time of passing the tests. <br><br>  The average number of tests for such users has increased by 3 times.  It became just interesting for people to look at a funny picture with a different number of answers.  Judging by the forums and reviews, people have begun to specifically try to make 20 mistakes (sic!), And this is more difficult than just not allowing more than one. <br><br>  On the launch day, everyone, even those who do not have rights and were not even going to receive them, sat and <b>‚Äúplayed the traffic police tests,‚Äù just for fun</b> . <br><br>  <b>4. Chip</b> . <br>  Give people the opportunity to respond to the blue in the face, but on what basis?  Obviously, a person needs to answer all questions to prepare for the exam.  But how to make training out of it? <br>  We searched for training methods related to testing and found nothing useful.  We had to develop our own algorithm.  And until you learn all the questions, the Marathon will not end. <br><br>  Those who have already received the rights cannot understand how to answer as much, but in fact only for the first week they <b>used the Marathon more than 2000 times</b> .  More than 1000 users specifically registered to use it. <br>  On the first day, the share of the Marathon in relation to the random ticket was twice lower, but now they are almost equal. <br><br>  <b>5. Registration</b> <br>  We gave the opportunity to pass the Marathon to the end and persist (not everyone can answer 800+ questions in one sitting?) Only to registered users.  But the user does not immediately know about it. <br><br>  It seems that this is a hoax, but in fact it is a mutually beneficial cooperation.  You are guaranteed not to frighten the user right away, but he gets the opportunity to stop at any convenient time. <br>  If you think about such services and achieve success: registration or payment only after the user is involved.  <b>The number of registrations daily increased 4 times!</b> <br><br>  <b>6. Virus</b> <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/340/78b/ae4/34078bae4996ce3862d7c86d6086cf70.png" align="right"><br>  How to tell low cost about your smart project?  <b>Give the opportunity to post information</b> about the test results to users themselves.  Yes!  It's fun to share with others, that today you are blonde, and tomorrow Vin Diesel or Michael Schumacher. <br>  People post and share their own results.  It's simple. <br><br>  And of course you shouldn't forget about communities like habrahabr! <br><br>  <b>Findings:</b> <br>  As you can see everything is trite and logical.  You just have to carefully analyze what is already there and improve it. <br>  If we had just improved the design, we would have managed to increase the attendance slightly, but we would not have achieved such growth.  It is very important to analyze the statistics and work on the audience that you have.  It makes no sense to develop in the first place site headings that are not in demand. <br><br>  To do something for people and to observe the correctness of the chosen path is SUPER. <br>  Make a service for people, give them a simple opportunity to share a link to your service and they will do everything themselves.  Do not forget to come up with a useful service :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83009/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83009/</a></p>
