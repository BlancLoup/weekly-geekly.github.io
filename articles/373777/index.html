Perhaps you yourself caught up on this: to keep from the sweet thoughts of ‚Äúoh, you would have bitcoins in 2010‚Äù, recounting the possible profits on the current course, sometimes it is not easy. <br><br>  However, there are simply no isolated moments of chance in history.  Every moment of the present may prove for someone the golden moment of luck in the future.  How not to overlook this moment?  Well, again - who knows the bundle ... But since we are a cryptocurrency project, then let's look at other cryptocurrencies.  Well, at least about those from the first, in our opinion, dozens. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/de2/354/248/de2354248998fa315e8ce976e19ed663.jpg">

      Of course, the tactic of bury money under a tree, which has already once given money, is considered rather conservative: the richest is usually the very first crop.  And to hope that somewhere in the list below there is a second bitcoin - it can also be rash.  But another thing is encouraging: that even Bitcoin itself has not even nearly exhausted the potential of a decentralized monetary unit.  And that means that somewhere, maybe already, or maybe just waiting for its birth, which will not be the second bitcoin, but will be the first one that has turned the world around.  However, as investors, we agree on less ambitious ideas, if the chance to make money is good enough. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The source of basic information in the preparation of this post was the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en">site Coingecko</a> with its chic rating.  Here, not only the course of the coin is taken into account, but also market trends, community size, and similar factors. <br><br><h3>  Bitcoin (Out of Rating) </h3><br>  <b>Course</b> : $ 4292 <br>  <b>Capitalization</b> : $ 71,014,372,063 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/85b/0e9/bd9/85b0e9bd905aae6728390e6cfc2ad829.jpg"><br><br>  About bitcoin does not write now just lazy.  All news about cryptocurrencies boils down to one thing: how is the cue ball?  In addition, most kryptomonet are called "Altcoins", because they are an alternative to Bitcoin.  A few days ago, the cue ball rose above $ 5000, but then quickly fell to the current rate.  This is due to several factors, including the fact that the ICO was banned in China. <br><br><h3>  1. Ethereum </h3><br>  <b>Course</b> : $ 289 <br>  <b>Capitalization</b> : $ 27,307,798,067 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/05e/2bb/2da/05e2bb2dabf732d6f48eee9160a4a398.png" width="1000"><br><br>  The broadcast has a cool infrastructure that served as the basis for creating many blockchain systems used by financial, insurance and legal organizations.  The same Sberbank or Alfa-Bank is now actively working with broadcast-like platforms.  Well, Ethereum inspires the confidence of investors and ordinary users, and its course, despite strong volatility in recent times, is growing. <br><br><h3>  2. Dash </h3><br>  <b>Course</b> : $ 306.54 <br>  <b>Capitalization</b> : $ 2,310,538,071 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2bc/034/ec2/2bc034ec28ec829ab8d60ad0c09d78bf.jpg"><br><br>  The developers of this cryptocurrency have focused not only on privacy, as in the case of Monero, but also on the speed of the transaction.  Dash is Darkcoin after rebranding.  Rebranding is needed so that users do not have association with the darknet. <br><br>  You can use Dash to pay for goods and services.  Although it receives a much smaller number of sellers than in the case of Bitcoin or ether, but their list is constantly expanding. <br><br><h3>  3. Litecoin </h3><br>  <b>Course</b> : $ 65.47 <br>  <b>Capitalization</b> : $ 3,455,366,374 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/be3/19b/21d/be319b21d94473633f2e186bda33358b.jpg"><br><br>  Another interesting cryptocurrency, which can be called a "veteran."  She appeared in October 2011.  It was created by ex-Google employee Google Lee as an alternative to Bitcoin.  In principle, their properties are similar.  It can be minted, it can pay for goods and services.  Lightcoin is also slowly moving forward. <br><br><h3>  4. Ripple </h3><br>  <b>Course</b> : $ 0.20 <br>  <b>Capitalization</b> : $ 7,531,995,892 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b33/eba/178/b33eba17864412f63e0f4b25a0701073.jpg"><br><br>  The next cryptocurrency is Ripple.  This is no longer just a coin, but a whole system of gross real-time settlement, currency exchange and money transfer, which was developed by Ripple.  It is sometimes also called a transaction protocol or simply a protocol.  She appeared in 2012.  A number of banks use this protocol in their work. <br><br><h3>  5. NEO </h3><br>  <b>Course</b> : $ 19.00 <br>  <b>Capitalization</b> : $ 949,994,228 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bf8/e24/b3b/bf8e24b3bbce01ec576c4b22c454596f.jpg"><br><br>  Initially, this coin was called Antshares, it appeared in October 2016.  Its course is not particularly jumped, there was no rapid growth or rapid fall.  True, after rebranding, the course quickly went uphill.  This blockchain platform is sometimes called the Chinese broadcast.  By the way, its code is open.  According to the developers, their cryptocurrency and infrastructure better than their competitors, supports digital identification, and also allows you to decentralize your assets without any problems. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://getmonero.org/">6. Monero</a> </h3><br>  <b>Course</b> : $ 103.82 <br>  <b>Capitalization</b> : $ 1,560,887,020 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/959/672/b62/959672b62dcf5ba868eab83dc2346276.png"><br><br>  This is an open source cryptocurrency, which is designed to conduct anonymous cash transactions.  The specificity of Monero is the emphasis on protection, privacy of user data.  Its creators believe that there is simply no better way to make confidential payments.  Perhaps they are right. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://lisk.io/">7. Lisk</a> </h3><br>  <b>Course</b> : $ 5.24 <br>  <b>Capitalization</b> : $ 585,522,821 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4ef/dbd/52e/4efdbd52eae6444e7d1da07729616d8b.jpg"><br><br>  This coin is very popular in China.  She went to the masses only at the end of May 2016, and since then has gained a sufficient number of fans.  The reason is its modularity.  The currency infrastructure is not integral, but consists of modules, each of which is responsible for its own function.  The main advantage of Lisk is that based on it, any developer can create their own application.  At the same time, Lisk applications work on Javascript, which most developers are familiar with. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://dogecoin.com/">8. Dogecoin</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d8a/004/a57/d8a004a5741f361f2f8c920e538f22cb.jpg" width="1000"><br><br>  <b>Course</b> : $ 0.0017 <br>  <b>Capitalization</b> : $ 194,791,711 <br><br>  Initially, it was conceived as a comic cryptocurrency, but was able to get its share of popularity.  His course is low, but the community is large enough.  Capitalization, despite the fact that 1 Dogecoin costs a tenth of a cent, is almost $ 200 million. Perhaps this cryptocurrency will still grow in value.  Her current rate allows you to earn, if, of course, the dynamics will be positive. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://z.cash/ru/">9. Zcash</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e27/513/b4e/e27513b4e6a804963d69eaa30518ea31.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Course</b> : $ 201.01 <br>  <b>Capitalization</b> : $ 424,205,272 <br><br>  The creators of cryptocurrency laid the foundation for the latest cryptographic achievements, for example, proof with zero agreement.  This allows you to verify an encrypted transaction without decrypting it.  As a result, each cryptocurrency unit does not contain any past usage history.  This is achieved by breaking the connection of the hidden Coin with their previous history.  The Zcash course is quite high, and it will probably grow in the future. <br><br>  That's all for today.  It should be remembered that a lot of cryptocurrency, and all in one post simply can not be mentioned.  Therefore, if you work with any coin that is not mentioned here, tell us about it in the comments.  Suddenly tomorrow her course will go up? <br><br>  And, of course, it is worth remembering that we mine not only bitcoin or ether.  There are other cryptocurrencies, which, by the way, are mentioned in the list. <br><br> <a href="https://hashflare.io/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3D290647"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/250/767/4d4/2507674d475b4b95b4ba9aac7aaf83c9.gif"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373777/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373777/</a></p>
