  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Service "Your personal computer"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It looks like a little flash drive.  In principle, he could be quite small, but then he would be lost in his pockets, and it would be inconvenient to hold him in his hands. <br>  Each Internet cafe has terminals with convenient keyboards and wide monitors.  The keyboard on the right has a small port where my personal computer connects (just put the USB flash drive next to it).  Similar terminals are located in hotels, airports, airplanes, sightseeing buses, and simply in various cafes similar to Kiwi payment devices. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  During the collections for departure, I sort out in my mind "I took the passport, I took the tickets, I took the money, I took the computer."  Oh, a small amendment - passports, money and tickets are not on paper, so simply - ‚ÄúDid the computer take it?  ‚ÄúI took it!‚Äù However, this is also superfluous, which I will discuss at the end. <br><br>  There are flash computers that contain several computers.  After you insert the USB flash drive into the port, the selection menu will appear - which of the computers you want to run.  But I have a flash drive with one computer (it‚Äôs cheaper - only 300 rubles a month, and I don‚Äôt want to be confused in two computers). <br><br>  At the core of the ‚ÄúYour Personal Computer‚Äù service are virtualization technologies. <br>  The flash drive, of course, contains the full last image of the computer, but first of all it is the secret access key.

      The real computing power is provided by the computing clusters of the service provider, and the images of computers with all backups are also stored there. <br>  Backup depth, computer power and disk space are the main parameters of the service.  The quality of the service is also determined by the level of availability of your virtual computer in different countries of the world and the speed of downloading a personal computer after you insert the flash drive into the terminal. <br><br>  Airlines are actively integrating with providers of the service ‚ÄúYour Personal Computer‚Äù and ensure the downloading of the image of your computer on board the aircraft. <br><br>  Different companies provide different lines of operating systems and applications included in the service.  The subscription fee for Microsoft operating systems is slightly higher than for Ubuntu.  Virtualization of a personal computer led to total control over pirated software, and many have learned the real price of paid applications.  Open source software has become more popular. <br><br>  The fight between providers is played out serious.  The subscription fee is dumped.  Software providers pay extra to providers for subscribers in exchange for installing demo versions of their products. <br><br>  People have already forgotten about the existence of computer boxes.  Data recovery services from hard drives disappeared as a phenomenon.  No one except cloud computing workers understands the computational hardware and data storage hardware. <br><br>  NetBooks of the last generation do not contain any mechanical devices and do not heat up.  Their most important parameter is the time without recharging and this time is calculated in weeks.  And of course a good screen and unkillable keyboard. <br><br>  Users have forgotten about the existence of iron and do not feel like complete idiots in a computer store, once again hearing from the seller that updating the processor for a home computer does not make sense that there are new standard ones and, of course, you need to replace the motherboard that entails Changing the processor, video card and the hard disk too, because the disk size of a terabyte nowadays is just ridiculous! <br><br>  To update their ‚Äúvirtual hardware‚Äù, people simply select the ‚ÄúUpdate computer configuration‚Äù item in the ‚ÄúStart‚Äù menu of their personal computer and request more disk space and more computing power there.  Advanced users can configure the type of power and set separately the interactive power and the depreciation power, which is convenient for those who use a personal computer as a server. <br><br>  For a little extra money, you can also connect the service "Availability of a computer within 30 seconds in any terminal of the world."  Of course, in the ‚ÄúStart‚Äù menu there will be options ‚ÄúTake a snapshot‚Äù and ‚ÄúRoll back to the snapshot ...‚Äù. <br><br>  NetBook + flash drive-computer and work without connecting to the global network, although there are some brakes and opportunities are limited.  But the places where the netbook can not find the Internet, is becoming less and less.  At the first connection to the network, the data is automatically synchronized with the server image. <br><br>  Recently, cloud computing technologies, incremental backup (technologies for calculating small diffs of images), data deduplication, and reliable distributed data storage with the built-in prediction system of the required data have been actively developed.  Still, serious attention is paid to improving user experience - the degree of interactivity with remote applications (working on a potentially distant cluster - unfortunately, not all providers have a wide network of clusters with low latency from any terminal in the world).  The X12 protocol had to be modified a lot so that it allowed the creation of a thick client part with paging in the background of possible reactions to the most likely user actions.  But there is still a lot of work in this direction.  Now the emphasis is on forecasting algorithms that determine which video news and movies where to migrate first. <br><br>  And a little more talk about the latest trends.  Popular is the service of access to a computer without a flash drive.  The personal computer can be opened by login and password.  And those who embedded a chip in their brain can have access to a personal computer without a password ... and without a keyboard ... and without a screen.  You can easily recognize them in the subway - they are strange people with their eyes closed, with active facial expressions, who are silently moving their lips.  They do not waste their time - they are already at work and have solved many important issues.  Perhaps they are currently in a virtual meeting room.  They have in their head the image of a clean room with a screen on the whole wall, on which the presentation is shown.  The room is full of people.  ‚ÄúDamn, again half of colleagues sent bots instead of themselves!  It will be necessary to tighten the access rules.  What is it!?  The competitors learned the password of the virtual audience and sent a three-meter-long Cheburashka screaming genes crocodile songs!  Well, again, the meeting is disrupted! ‚Äú <br><br>  Beautiful far away, do not be so cruel to us! <br><br>  PS: Investors, do not sleep! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77149/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77149/</a></p>
