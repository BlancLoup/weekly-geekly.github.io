  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Problem-oriented approach to projects in Internet marketing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  The article will be useful primarily for web-studios and digital-agencies that are seeking to improve their competence in the field of client projects and want to learn how to dive into virtually any niche step by step * </p><br><p>  * In addition to new areas where the market has not yet formed </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/71/3s/nd/713sndj3ejf_pfpmqud3lxpwz-c.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Prehistory </h2><br><p>  How does the typical work on a new project begin, which falls into the production or advertising department after signing the contract? </p><br><ol><li>  The manager accepts the project, studies the brief, gets acquainted with the client. </li><li>  The assignment of tasks begins. </li><li>  The planning meeting briefly describes the new project - literally a couple of words. </li><li>  All diverge and proceed directly to work in the fields. </li></ol><br><p>  At best, a study of examples from other similar sites is added to this list.  Sometimes even completely different subjects. </p><br><p>  <b>Why is this approach incorrect?</b> </p><br><p>  Because in this way no one from the team fully understands what is required of him, and what are the "pitfalls" in this area of ‚Äã‚Äãbusiness.  All the work is based on the client‚Äôs ‚Äúwishes‚Äù and some fleeting ideas of the performers.  These tactical jerks and attempts to do something "blindly" rarely end successfully.  The result is a product that does not meet market expectations.  They lose everything: the client, contractors, clients of the client. </p><br><h2>  What to do to become your man "in the subject"? <br></h2><br><p>  When the project is worth it, and you are serious, I want to know everything about it.  Familiar to this feeling?  Some try to dive so deeply that they turn from internet marketers into builders, restaurateurs and others. </p><br><p>  But seriously, you need to face it.  Suppose that this huge project is for a year or two, and you know for sure that you will be friends with the customer for a long time and fruitfully.  Is it possible for such a period to become an expert in their field?  Theoretically, yes.  Practically - probably not.  It is unlikely that you will be ready to re-read the mountains of literature, go to all sorts of seminars, get to know the right people and experience all the business of this business, which you will most likely never connect your life with. </p><br><p>  Therefore, the question posed in the subtitle, despite its popularity, is fundamentally wrong.  Need to think about something else. </p><br><h2>  How to quickly master a niche without overloading yourself with unnecessary data? <br></h2><br><p>  The essence of the method is extremely simple.  It is based on feedback that can be collected during the analysis of reviews. </p><br><h3>  Collection of competitor sites <br></h3><br><p>  Each of us at least once in his life faced with a competitive analysis.  Someone telephoned his colleagues, hiding behind a made-up legend, to find out the "chips" they used in the pre-sale.  And someone just did it on request of the client. </p><br><p>  Now the task is easier - you just need to identify the companies that are in the niche of this customer.  It is useful to add to the list even competitors from other regions operating in different price segments, with different positioning.  You can benefit from any feedback! </p><br><p>  <b>Obvious search methods:</b> </p><br><ul><li>  Ask the customer himself (because you have a corresponding question in the brief, which you have already asked, right?). </li><li>  Google. </li><li>  Ratings </li><li>  2GIS and any regional guides / maps. </li></ul><br><p>  At the exit you should have a table listing all the companies found: </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l8/6e/tc/l86etc7jw1nbuxpkjj4ygdcvsea.png"></div><br><p>  Keep an open tab close at hand - it will come in handy soon. </p><br><h3>  Reviewing reviews and identifying issues </h3><br><p>  Go to monitoring reviews.  We collect all feedback from customers of these institutions. </p><br><p>  <b>Where to looking for:</b> </p><br><br><ul><li>  Catalogs / Ratings / Otzoviki (zoon.ru, flamp.ru, yell.ru, etc.). </li><li>  Reference books and maps. </li><li>  Soc.  network. </li></ul><br><p>  Based on the reviews found, we compile a list of the typical ‚Äúpain‚Äù of customers - which they most often complain about: </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pa/up/b4/paupb4czhfe78vwydgp7afxxc80.png"></div><br><p>  It is necessary to pay attention to everything, even the seemingly insignificant, customer complaints.  This list reflects market expectations / requirements. </p><br><h3>  Searching of decisions </h3><br><p>  When the problem is marked, it is time to find solutions. </p><br><p>  <b>And there are 2 vectors here:</b> </p><br><br><ol><li>  The client‚Äôs business itself is with its product, processes and people. </li><li>  Internet Marketing.  First of all - the site. </li></ol><br><p>  If you can (and must) influence the second vector of development, then a business is a completely different path, where contractors are usually not just not allowed, but even hide the real state of affairs.  You have the right to interview the client, ask leading questions and clarify whether a decision is planned in the near future, but it is pointless to try to influence it.  If the company has problems, for example, with the selection of personnel, then do not even think of becoming freelance recruiters for them.  Prompt friends who are in search of work - this is the norm.  But to interfere in solving the global problem of personnel - no. </p><br><p>  Therefore, as Internet marketing specialists, all you have to do is to focus on the strengths of the client business and [at a minimum] not to single out the weak sides. </p><br><p>  When we talk about bringing a new audience to the site, for them the client‚Äôs company is an uncharted ocean.  If they do not prove that there is a very steep level of service, then before the 1st experience of interacting with the business, they will rather believe that everything is bad.  Therefore, the essence of our work is the demonstration of advantages, the search for solutions to prove: </p>
