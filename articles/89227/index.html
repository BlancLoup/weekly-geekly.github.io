  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Control call-up of Internet agency clients - why is it needed and what is the profit from it?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello colleagues! <br><br>  The main business of our company is the provision of Internet marketing services (website promotion, contextual, display advertising, etc.) <br><br>  I want to share one of the tools that we use in working with clients.  This is a control call. <br>  In fact, it is similar to a test purchase, but it is very different in purpose: if a test purchase often carries a negative, then a control call is a joy, a positive and an increase in the effect of advertising, in the end :-) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Preamble. </h4><br>  - We have a marketing scheme on the Internet, which I will publish a little later, if interested.  And one of the stages of this scheme is the client's call from the Internet to the company, and the processing of this call.  As practice shows, many problems can arise at this stage. <br>  - some time ago, several of our customers at once declared in one voice that the advertising we are doing for them does not bring the desired effect.  This brought us to the thought of a control call.

    <br><h4>  What is it all the same. </h4><br>  Everything is very simple.  Our manager calls our client under the guise of his client, and records the processing of the request according to some simple parameters. <br>  As a result, we have the data, which we in an adapted form include in the report to the client.  Accordingly, we can point out obvious problems or, conversely, praise the client for the good work :-) <br><br>  Here is an example of a control call tag. <br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/serj-n/view/279592/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/421/b9f/106/421b9f1068a6a8cc8280b11111dfb3d6.jpg" width="800" height="318" title="ringing" alt=""></a> <br><br><h4>  What is the profit? </h4><br>  By identifying problems that occur during the processing of an appeal, and bringing these problems to the attention of customers, we firstly increase customer loyalty to our agency, and secondly, together with the customer, we think how to solve the problem and increase the effectiveness of the advertising campaign on the Internet. <br><br><h4>  The main problems arising at the stage of appeal. </h4><br>  In order of decreasing frequency of occurrence: <br><ol><li>  Did not know the source of the appeal.  This is a real scourge, and not only of our work with clients.  Most of our customers do not know where the customer who applied to their company found out about them.  As a result, when I hear a phrase like ‚ÄúWe are not called from the Internet,‚Äù I wondered - how do you know if the calls are not tracked? <br>  As practice shows, the introduction of a call tracking system (and other calls) solves problems for approximately 70% of clients. </li><li>  The problem with the phones (do not work, always busy, do not pick up the phone).  For me it was a discovery, but problems with phones are very common. </li><li>  Poorly established system of internal communications - when a call is received for a very long time it cannot figure out to which specialist a client should be switched. </li><li>  Problems of professionalism of employees who receive calls.  This refers to various problems in the course of the conversation - the manager‚Äôs illiteracy, impolite dialogue, and so on.  Since there is a high risk of subjective perception of the manager, this item should be carefully analyzed. </li><li>  "Go to our site, everything is there."  It is difficult to say what caused such a response, but quite often the client is sent to the site without providing the necessary advice.  In this case, without specifying whether a person has already come from the site :-) </li></ol><br><br><h4>  Perspectives. </h4><br>  To date, the following next steps in the development of this tool are planned: <br><ol><li>  Formalization of call processing estimates - to facilitate the task of managers making dialing calls and for obtaining formal data for statistics. </li><li>  On the basis of claim 1 - the formalization of a report for customers on a control call. </li><li>  Connecting other communication channels to check - it often happens that incoming calls are processed normally, but on e-mails and other electronic applications you have to wait a long time for a response. </li></ol><br><br>  Thanks to everyone who has read the post to the end, I will be happy to answer questions, and also listen to your suggestions - not very constructive ;-) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/89227/">https://habr.com/ru/post/89227/</a></p>
