  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Around Citrix NetScaler ADC - Part 2. Citrix and Microsoft</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Citrix has been working with Microsoft in a number of ways for a long time.  One of these areas is the use of the Netscaler ADC application delivery controller for balancing and optimizing Microsoft solutions that actively use web technologies, such as Skype for Business (Lync), Exchange, SQL Server and SharePoint. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a4e/d92/d58/a4ed92d58b1e4ee3aee3a62e7b4c9971.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Previously, Microsoft recommended using NLB technology for fault tolerance, but due to a number of limitations of this technology, the company added third-party application controllers, including Citrix NetScaler, to its recommended architectures. <br><br>  Each Microsoft solution requires its own approach.  Citrix NetScaler is able to provide resiliency and security for virtually all Microsoft products.  Let's see which technologies within Citrix NetScaler can be used for some products.  It should be noted that this description of opportunities is not the most complete and is intended to tell only about the main features.  Functionality can be used in various combinations.

    <h3>  Balancing </h3><br>  <b>Microsoft Sharepoint</b> <br><br>  In this case, NetScaler will balance Sharepoint servers.  Web Application Firewall protects the corporate portal from specific web attacks and corporate information leaks.  Offloading SSL operations will significantly reduce the load on the server infrastructure.  Front End Optimization and caching can significantly speed up the delivery of content to the user (this will be especially noticeable in mobile networks). <br><br>  <b>Microsoft Exchange</b> <br><br>  It is proposed to use load balancing between different servers and SSL Offload, thus it will be possible to use traffic distribution depending on the type of request (L7 Content Switching), which will allow traffic to be redistributed to CAS servers with different roles.  Pre-authentication on NetScaler, will protect against Brute force attacks (NetScaler has built-in protection mechanisms), as well as use multi-factor authentication to access Exchange. <br><br>  NetScaler brings additional functionality to work with Skype for Business, Office 365, Direct Access and replace the TMG product that has completed its life cycle. <br><br>  To properly configure Citrix NetScaler for the Microsoft Product Infrastructure, we recommend that you read the relevant implementation guides, which describe in detail the integration of NetScaler with these and many other products.  These documents are available on the <a href="https://www.citrix.com/products/netscaler-adc/resources/deploy.html">official website</a> of Citrix. <br><br>  In addition, there are customization templates that can significantly speed up the deployment of these products. <br><br>  <b>Traffic optimization</b> <br><br>  This is not the only way Citrix can improve Microsoft applications.  For example, Citrix XenDesktop contains the RealTime Optimization Pack component, which allows Microsoft Skype for Business (Lync) to work normally in a virtual environment.  Without this support, the Lync client will transfer audio and video traffic through Microsoft Lync Server.  RealTime Optimization Pack allows two clients to exchange voice and video in the "point-to-point" mode within the local network, sending only session management information to the data center.  Currently, this is the only way to improve Microsoft Lync in a virtual environment, which is also officially supported by Microsoft. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ad/838/d3a/8ad838d3a25a4f39a016cf4f14afa6d1.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Virtualization </h3><br>  Another area of ‚Äã‚Äãcollaboration between Microsoft and Citrix is ‚Äã‚Äãdesktop and application virtualization.  At one time, Citrix developed terminal services for the Microsoft OS / 2 operating system, then for Microsoft Windows NT.  Since then, Citrix has been working with Microsoft, constantly adding new features to the solutions for virtualization and terminal mode support that Microsoft has.  The latest results of this collaboration are that Microsoft is abandoning its own Azure RemoteApp cloud solution, which provided the local Microsoft RemoteApp program based on remote desktops in Azure, and recommends customers use the Citrix XenDesktop remote desktops solution.  In addition, the Microsoft licensing policy (SPLA) actually prohibits the ‚Äúgive away‚Äù client OS from the cloud, and allows only the server desktop to be used at remote user sites.  And the only way to provide a client desktop from the cloud infrastructure, which Microsoft has announced to support, will be to work with the Windows 10 virtual machine, which must be deployed in the Microsoft Azure cloud and delivered using Citrix XenDesktop. <br><br><h3>  Mobility </h3><br>  The third line of collaboration between Citrix and Microsoft is related to the management of mobile applications.  The Citrix XenMobile infrastructure allows you to ‚Äúwrap‚Äù a corporate application for a mobile device into a so-called security container, prohibiting relevant policies such actions as using a video camera, external links, clipboard, etc.  Thus, on the mobile device, a distinction is made between personal and corporate applications. <br><br>  In fact, Citrix XenMobile, of course, works not only with Microsoft.  The list of support for mobile applications of various manufacturers in the Citrix XenMobile infrastructure includes dozens of programs, including such popular ones as Adobe Reader for Android, Exact CRM for Android and iOS, IBM Connections Android and iOS, MindLink for iOS, Microsoft Office 365, Microsoft SharePoint Mobile Client and many others. <br><br><h3>  Cloud storage </h3><br>  Finally, Citrix allows you to use Microsoft Azure to run Citrix ShareFile.  This is a corporate ‚Äúcloud storage‚Äù, which differs from such solutions as Dropbox or Yandex disk in that it works with the corporate directory and allows you to set policies, such as the lifetime of a link to a file share, the number of downloads, download rights, an access password etc.  Companies can build various hybrid schemes using ShareFile, using not only cloud infrastructure, but also local storage deployed in the customer data center.  Citrix ShareFile also allows you to replicate data between various user-owned devices: a work computer, laptop, home PC, etc.  In addition to Microsoft Azure, the solution also supports Amazon Web Services and can connect to the general list of resources local installations of Microsoft SharePoint, network directories and cloud-based Office365 documents.  To enhance security, Citrix added IRM functionality and DLP support using ICAP. <br><br>  * * * <br><br>  It is easy to conclude from the above that Citrix, as a developer, could significantly expand the functionality of its solutions, duplicating the capabilities offered by other vendors, such as Cisco and Microsoft. <br><br>  And it's easy to see why she doesn't do that.  For example, Citrix is ‚Äã‚Äãnot interested in extending the functionality of Netscaler ADC to a full-fledged firewall ‚Äî instead of entering into full-scale competition in the firewall market, it is easier to integrate with its leader.  That's why Cisco recommends Citrix Netscaler ADC as the best balancer for Cisco ACI, and Microsoft for the Microsoft network platform.  Say without false modesty - the way it is. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/317686/">https://habr.com/ru/post/317686/</a></p>
