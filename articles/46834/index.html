  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The legend of the fire.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once upon a time, one man, concentrating on the secrets of nature, revealed the secret of making fire. <br><br>  This man was called Nur.  Nur decided to share his discovery with people and for this he began to travel from community to community. <br><br>  He passed his secret to many groups of people.  Some have taken advantage of this knowledge.  Others, without taking the trouble to think about how useful it could be for them, understood only that Nur was dangerous for them and drove him away.  In the end, the people of a tribe, before whom he demonstrated his art, came to a wild panic and killed him, seeing in him the fiend of hell. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Centuries passed.  In one community, in which Nur once taught people how to make fire, this knowledge was preserved only by special priests enjoying power, wealth, and warmth, while the rest of the people froze from the cold.  Another community completely forgot the art of Nur and began to worship the tools of making fire.  The people of the third community worshiped the image of Nur himself, since  it was he who was their teacher.  In the fourth community, the story of discovery of fire in legends and traditions has been preserved - some believed in them, others did not.  The fifth community did use fire, and it allowed them to stay warm, cook and produce various useful items.

      And now, after many, many years, a wise man with a small group of students traveled through the lands of these tribes.  The disciples were amazed at the sight of so many different rituals that they encountered here. <br><br>  “But all these actions relate only to making fire and nothing more,” they said to the teacher.  “Our duty is to reveal the truth to these people.” <br>  “Well, I agree,” answered the teacher.  “We will repeat our journey, and thanks to this new goal, those of you who survive the end of it will learn what the real problems are and how to solve them.” <br><br>  So, the sage and his disciples reached the first tribe, where they were given a warm welcome.  The priests invited travelers to the ceremony of "creation of fire." <br><br>  When the ceremony ended, and the crowd excitedly experienced the “miracle” they saw, the master addressed the disciples: <br>  - Do any of you want to reveal the truth to these people? <br>  The first student said: "In the name of truth, I consider myself obliged to talk to these people." <br>  “If you are going to do it at your own peril and risk, then begin,” answered the teacher. <br>  The disciple came forward, stood before the leader of the tribe and the priests surrounding him, and said: <br>  - I can perform a miracle that you attribute to a special manifestation of deity.  If I do this, do you recognize that you have been in error for centuries? <br>  - Grab it!  Shouted the priests. <br>  This man was captured and taken away, and no one ever saw him again. <br><br>  The travelers set off and after some time approached the territory of the second congregation, where they worshiped the tools for extracting fire.  Another student volunteered to reason these people. <br><br>  With the permission of the master, he said: “I want to talk to you, as with sensible people.  You do not even worship the thing itself, but only the means by which it can be produced.  Thus, you are unable to use this thing.  I know the reality underlying your rite. ” <br><br>  This community consisted of more intelligent people.  But they told the student: <br>  - Since you are our guest, we honored you with hospitality.  However, being a stranger, unfamiliar with our history and custom, you cannot understand what we are doing.  You are wrong;  perhaps you are even trying to deprive us of our religion or to change it.  Therefore, we do not want to listen to you. <br><br>  The travelers moved on.  Having reached the lands of the third community, they saw in front of each house an idol depicting Nur, the discoverer of fire.  The third student addressed the community leaders as follows: <br>  “This idol depicts a person who personifies the opportunity that a person is able to use, doesn't he? <br>  “Maybe this is the case,” answered Nur's admirers, “but only a few have been given to penetrate this secret.” <br>  “Yes, but only to the few who will understand, and not to those who refuse to look at certain facts,” said the third student. <br>  “All this is heresy, moreover, it is expressed by a person who does not even speak our language correctly and does not belong to the priests, to the initiates of our faith,” the priests grumbled. <br>  And this student did not succeed. <br><br>  So the group continued their journey until they arrived in the fourth community.  This time, the fourth student spoke before the assembly of people.  He declared: <br>  - The story of making fire is true.  I know how to make fire. <br>  Confusion arose in the crowd, dissenting voices were heard.  Some said: <br>  “Perhaps this is true, and if so, then we certainly want to know how to make fire.” <br><br>  But when the master and his followers experienced them, it turned out that the majority sought to use fire for their personal gain.  They did not understand that fire is something necessary for human progress.  The minds of the overwhelming number of people of this tribe were so imbued with perverse legends that those who imagined themselves capable of perceiving the truth as such, in fact, turned out to be, as a rule, unbalanced people who could not get fire, even if they were shown how . <br><br>  There were others who said: “Of course, there is nothing truthful in the legends.  This person just wants to fool us in order to occupy a high position in our community. ” <br>  The third party said: “Our legends should remain as they are, because this is our legacy that unites all of us into one.  If we now abandon them, and then we find that the new interpretation is worthless, what will become of our society? ” <br>  There were also other points of view. <br><br>  So, the group went on and finally came to the territory of the fifth community, where the making of fire was something ordinary and publicly available.  But there travelers met the challenges. <br><br>  And then the master said to his students: <br>  - You have to learn how to teach, because a person does not want to be taught.  First you need to teach people how to learn.  And before that, it is still necessary to explain to them that there is something that should be learned.  People imagine that they already know everything.  They want to study what they consider necessary to study - and not what should be studied first.  Only when you understand all this will we be able to invent a learning method.  Knowledge without special ability to teach is not the same as knowledge and the presence of this ability. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46834/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46834/</a></p>
