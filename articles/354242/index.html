The first NicGrade is a marketing automation platform from a company of the same name.  The second is <a href="https://startpack.ru/application/firework-by-startpack">Firework</a> from Startpack. <br><br>  The first application I just needed to work and I stopped at the <a href="https://nicgrade.com/ru">NicGrade</a> version <a href="https://nicgrade.com/ru">because</a> of its simplicity, UX and the free version.  Plus, colleagues promise integration with AI algorithms that will guess the optimal time for sending emails to my database.  The second application launches cloud services in the desktop application mode and helped reduce the number of times the browser's open tabs.  The guys promise to release a corporate version with settings for roles and access rights.

    <h3>  Large </h3><br>  Sberbank has a third attempt to show the clouds to its customers.  This time, colleagues packed several leading services in the White Label offer and called it <a href="https://www.sberbank.ru/ru/s_m_business/bankingservice/remoteservice/new_means">‚ÄúOnline Services‚Äù</a> .  Let me remind you that earlier there was the launch of the SaaS marketplace and loyalty from the Business Environment, when customers received SaaS at a discount.  If you believe the Viagra group, then there should be 5 attempts to bring SaaS to the bank‚Äôs customers in a normal, in-demand form. <br><br>  1C launched <a href="http://alliance.cloud/">Cloud Alliance</a> .  The essence is short: everyone who bought 1C is now sold ‚Äúin one window‚Äù under one contract for all services with support and additional services. <br><br>  Mail.ru has enveloped its clouds for business with some not very clear <a href="https://biz.mail.ru/club/">Club of users</a> and offers discounts on other SaaS, including.  I tried to place my decisions there and after 3 months of waiting I was refused without giving reasons. <br><br>  Beeline sells business solutions - <a href="https://moskva.beeline.ru/business/delo/">Mobile Enterprise</a> in retail stores in boxes similar to tariffs.  Well, perhaps, business owners are people and they are in the company's stores. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mq/co/fo/mqcofojqg6buyrbv9emltybezac.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, all actions for the development of the direction of large players are very strange, but I cannot evaluate them and I suggest just to watch the development of events.  Of the positive, the big ones also have a positive overall component. <br><br><h3>  Their services </h3><br>  The contour gave birth to some unknown cloud animal crossing an accountant and a banker.  ‚Äú <a href="http://elbabank.ru/">Elba</a> . <a href="http://elbabank.ru/">Bank</a> is your electronic accountant-banker‚Äù - the slogan blinds us.  In essence, Elba. Bank is a bank and accounting in one window, one support service, general financial monitoring, a single signature, a single tariff, a single attraction.  No comments. <br><br>  Sberbank was integrated with Internet accounting ‚ÄúMy business‚Äù, and the latter officially opened the API. <br><br>  Yandex started to sell its workflow <a href="https://yandex.ru/tracker/">tracker</a> with Agile support to everyone. <br><br>  The company Rostelecom launched the <a href="https://lk.ereporting.rt.ru/ereport/login%3F3">E-reporting</a> platform, which includes services for outsourcing reporting, accounting and exchanging certified information for business.  Even Rostelecom has been appointed the only executor for the provision of domestic software to the authorities according to the SaaS model (UPD: discussions are not over). <br><br><h3>  Right </h3><br>  In early 2017, the Ministry of Finance clarified the procedure for paying VAT when transferring programs via the Internet and retained the VAT benefits for the SaaS model.  Always did. <br><br><h3>  Deals </h3><br>  Bukhsoft, the developer of the accounting and reporting service, has become part of the Aktion-MCFER media holding - in October the merger took place.  FRIA and <a href="http://startacapital.com/">Starta Capital are</a> investing something in the clouds, but this is all blurry and not obvious in their portfolios.  <a href="http://dentaltap.com/">Dental Cloud</a> closed the deal in Vietnam (mine). <br><br><h3>  Dvizhuha </h3><br>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/terekhov.andrey%3Ffref%3Dpb%26hc_location%3Dprofile_browser">Andrei Terekhov</a> (COSSA) spent the first Black Friday for SaaS.  I did not participate and asked him to tell about the results, but it did not happen.  The next state of emergency is scheduled for June 2018. <br><br><h3>  Fales </h3><br>  Selectel lay down and <a href="https://www.moysklad.ru/">MoySklad was unwell for</a> about 24 hours. <br><br><h3>  Content </h3><br>  Definitely <a href="https://startpack.ru/">Starpack</a> industry pier has <a href="https://startpack.ru/">become</a> .  In addition to the excellent filling of the site for the clouds, the editorial staff, jointly with the ‚ÄúRussian cloud computing professional association‚Äù ( <a href="https://www.facebook.com/antonsalov">Anton Salov</a> ), launched two large special projects - ‚ÄúDeveloper's Tribune‚Äù and top vendors come to it and respond in one article to one relevant business -question.  The second format is ‚ÄúPersons of the Russian SaaS‚Äù and this interview with the founders, where we ask them the same questions in order to understand the formula for the success of SaaS. <br><br>  Everything and we add important events of the SaaS segment of 2017 in the comments, as I looked at what was happening with one eye and was busy with the <a href="http://cwsim.com/">roaming-free revolution</a> and <a href="http://dentaltap.com/ru/">DentalTap</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/354242/">https://habr.com/ru/post/354242/</a></p>
