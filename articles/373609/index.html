The main difference of the event was the bias in practical and ‚Äúproduct‚Äù design.  For three days, leading designers of Russia told how and why they do the things we use every day - from turnstiles in the metro to the design of the dashboards of the Mir space station. <br><br>  Alas, not everyone was able to get on this design holiday, so I decided to take a small interview for Habr from Sergey Smirnov from Smirnov Design - one of the oldest and most famous industrial design studios in Russia (Barrier filters, Pilot surge filters, work on the Lokhod "Selenokhod" ).  In recent years, the company has focused on the design of medical equipment, so Sergei gave a lecture on "Industrial Design and Medicine." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/2f2/569/e8b/2f2569e8b12b4253a5fee609698b6c73.jpg">

      <b>- Let us immediately with sharp questions: should the design cause a ‚Äúwow‚Äù effect?</b>  <b>In the world of software, everything is exactly like this - if there is no unique piece in the game, then its chances to reach the top are small.</b>  <b>How true is this for industrial design?</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  - I think it is unfair if we are talking about the design of some simple things with clear functions.  For example, a very convenient program that dials a phone number or text in a smartphone, as soon as some chips are added to it, becomes more difficult for the user, he needs to get used again.  Design is actually a very common term and a very wide format, so you always want to get away from the "wow" effect.  In my understanding - design is a much broader task, it can not only surprise, but also change the experience.  Often, today, only emotion is required from design, the sale of this emotion - of course, without this chip, it will not work, but this is 10% of cases.  And 90% of the objects that surround us and we use every day, utilitarian software - all this is also done by designers, and these things should be functional, comfortable and inconspicuous, because if a person will pay attention to everything, then the head will explode. <br><br>  <b>- Tell us what industrial design is and how does it work?</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe designer is an inter-sectoral integrator in the field of creating new products.  This is a person who needs to weigh everything and design a future product, albeit not completely, but to make it a future concept.  Designers, technologists will help him to put it into life and develop the product; other specialists will finance it, finance will be financed, so designers must be developed so broadly that they have a broad outlook and knowledge in various fields. <br>  If he thinks that he is responsible only for the ‚Äúwow‚Äù effect, then designers, developers, businessmen start to dislike him, because all this is very expensive.  Here is a delicate moment, because we are all emotional and bright design is always heard.  We always notice the top designs of world stars, but very often we do not pay attention to those that just help us live.  It‚Äôs like signs: a black cat passed over and something bad happened - we tied it up, and if there are 10 black cats and nothing happened - we don‚Äôt draw any conclusions.  So here - we begin to pay attention to design when it becomes very emotionally interesting to us.  And we absolutely do not notice those things that are simply convenient, which are in our everyday life. <br>  In 1849, Richard Red Gray in the Design and manufectures magazine gave an interesting quote that surprises me a lot, and therefore I constantly quote it.  It sounds like this: ‚ÄúDesign is a collection of all complex processes, and secondly, it is ornamentation and decoration, but unfortunately, the public generally perceives this second part, and not all processes in general.‚Äù  And the most surprising thing is that this problem of design perception still exists; we constantly encounter it in work.  When serious problems, serious business projects, serious businessmen require very utilitarian things that we develop, often at meetings in large offices they wait for the designer to surprise them.  This is the deformation of the consequences of this duality.  If we are talking about some utilitarian thing, a cigarette lighter, for example, a disposable one, then it should not be surprising.  If it is surprising, it will be sold a hundred times less than planned.  When we need to buy a cigarette lighter along with cigarettes, other emotions work for us, and not an impression.  This question is studied on research - what factors affect the design of the product. <br>  And I have a classic example, which I always tell, it happened at the very beginning of my career.  I had already learned in Stroganovka and in 1994 I developed my first commercial project - the wall switch.  Of course, he is already obsolete, I don‚Äôt show it anywhere, but it is still being sold.  And interestingly, it is sold in wild quantities - hundreds of millions.  Very simple.  I made it, went into the army, when in 1997 I returned, it was already sold on the shelves, successfully occupied my market niche, a good business project turned out.  The manufacturing company says to me: ‚ÄúYou are so well done!  You do it all. ‚Äù  I was asked to do another one.  I said to myself: since I was able to make it so simple, it will turn out bright.  There will be an emotion.  A switch is not just a socket, it‚Äôs also keys, telephone sockets, tele-antennas, it‚Äôs a kind of product range and a big investment.  And so I made this switch, I was skeptical about it, but I was able to convince at the meeting that everything would be in order.  It was my second or third commercial development, I was taught a lesson very early.  Two more years passed, and the switch was on the store shelves.  The sale of the new switch was 0.06% of the first sales amount.  It was a disaster.  In particular, the switch has such a feature - it must fit into the interior and it is neutral.  Walls, wallpaper, lamp, may be noticeable, but the switch does not require it at all.  Since then, I understood quite well that the ‚Äúwow‚Äù effect is not always appropriate. <br><br>  <b>- It turns out you went to study at Stroganovka even before the collapse of the USSR?</b> <br><br>  - Yes, I entered the Stroganov Academy in 1991.  My father studied there, he made a lunar movie camera - it generally deserves a separate post, Habr's readers will be interested.  Stroganov was founded in 1825 by Count Stroganov, he opened the art-industrial school to prepare "draftsmen for industry."  Ivan Zholtovsky, a Soviet architect, a post-constructivist, designed a new building in the 1950s to give it a new impetus.  After graduating from Stroganovka, my father went to the Krasnogorsk Mechanical Plant, which produced the Zenit cameras, which we all know.  The plant except civil produced and special products.  When the factory management in developing the lunar camera began to use the standard layout - two women with films, a lens, she stuck out from the suit, which was terribly inconvenient.  My father was young and unchallenged, he arranged the details differently, he and the graduate Baumanki together made a tablet and a layout. <br>  The father offered this design department to serious and experienced colleagues, where the film had to be very cleverly crammed inside the mechanism - they said that he was a young designer, and they sent him to "grow."  When the astronauts came to the plant to look at the proposals and those solutions, they looked first at the factory camera.  They asked if there were any other options, then the father presented his development.  Of course, he behaved incorrectly, but she was so innovative and functional that everyone chose her.  He filed a copyright certificate, where there were two names - Smirnov Albert Petrovich and his colleague from Baumanka.  At a large plant in such documents should be the chief engineer, responsible designer, in Soviet times it was a revolution.  He was strongly disliked, but the plant had to solve these technological challenges.  The result was a unique camera with a design that has no analogues in the world.  This camera was ready to fly, if the "lunar" race was not stopped, then this unit would lie on the moon.  I, in fact, followed in the footsteps of my father. <br><br>  <b>- Where is the design going?</b>  <b>What are the trends from the 60s and what will be the 2020s?</b> <br><br>  - Now I am writing a dissertation and investigating two important topics in it: honest design and cmf-design (color material finishing).  Honest design is based on principles: we create a product, we are not trying to deceive someone with a form - the form is fully consistent with the content, if necessary, it can be complicated.  Here is an example of modern smartphones - they are all quite similar, because they are honestly made, they have all the elements in the right place, they have no redundant parts.  In the 2000s and 90s, mobile phones, if you remember, were very redundant in terms of shaping; now this is not the case.  The second example of a complex shaping, but honest design - it is Dyson vacuum cleaners.  We see the device, its functionality, nobody hides it under the covers.  The product is presented as it is, it seems to me important - clarity of reading the functional, its capabilities, ideas.  The second is cmf design.  This trend is beginning to develop, because due to the simplicity of the forms, it is required to add emotions through the color-textured combinations, we see complex shades - metallic, textures and textures.  A lot of attention is paid to this now, the trend has been developing for 10 years.  We are now at the peak, and it will still remain.  Adding emotion to be honest is also achieved with interesting graphics or unusual material.  The technologies themselves are already interesting, they just need to honestly submit. <br><br>  <b>- Which of today's corporations can be called a model of style?</b>  <b>Apple?</b>  <b>Mercedes?</b> <br><br>  - Thanks for the tips (laughs).  I really respect Apple, although I do not use it myself.  I have a simple iPhone - it is inconvenient for me, but a very large number of people are their consumers.  I admire the form and their philosophy, how it is made.  All this causes respect.  This is a very serious work, multifactorial, people invested in materials and technologies, usability research - everything is brought to the absolute.  Mercedes is the car that I finally stopped at, although I tried a lot.  I understood that this is a very clear product made with great care and care of designers and designers.  In fact, there are a lot of products, I don‚Äôt even want to single out someone separately.  The modern market is very tough, it quickly reacts to failure and failure.  A business can simply be closed if the manufacturer does something carelessly or inaccurately, this also applies to design.  We now live in times of very spoiled user.  Those successful companies that we see are all worthy of praise, this is a lot of hard work that has been done by many people.  I am pleased, I am proud that design is now becoming an important component of success.  For a number of products and technologies - the most important.  Technologies are becoming well-developed - the ability to sell, build, logistics, everything is very clear, that is, it is easy to produce a product.  It is difficult to develop a new product, add a new emotion.  I kind of do not agree with the necessity of the ‚Äúwow‚Äù factor and its absoluteness, but if you answer the question from the point of view of a new product and how to stand out and make contact with the consumer, he plays his part.  Now the consumer perceives so quickly, ‚Äúhis‚Äù product or not ‚Äúhis‚Äù, that sometimes we have only 0.2 seconds to make contact.  The designer must be empathetic and gifted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/367/33b/d68/36733bd68c24b641697bd49b625c6b7b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>- How is it that such a new and fresh Apple design is almost the entire copy of the design of the Braun 60s products?</b> <br><br>  - I agree with this, the fact is that these waves, when honest design and cmf-design followed the trend of shaping, they are constantly replacing each other.  If we are talking about predictions, then the form at some point will again become complicated.  And this goes deep into history, it suffices to recall the constructivism of the beginning of the century, the experiments of the Bauhaus School, which rethought how furniture and household items should look like.  All this has replaced the complex classical device products. <br><br>  <b>- Where is the edge of design now?</b>  <b>In smartphones?</b>  <b>In space technology?</b> <br><br>  - Smartphones all go to the interface - something that Nokia was afraid of 14 years ago, when they were the absolute leader in terms of money, sales in the world and earned as much as all other manufacturers combined.  Then there were no smartphones, they were afraid that the phone would cease to be an important accessory of life, like an alarm fob, for example, or as cheap telephones are now for 1000 rubles.  They created experimental design work and made attempts to preserve the elitism of the phone as a certain sign of status, an exclusive accessory of life.  This was due to the fact that the Chinese began to catch up with them - where it is cheaper and easier, China eats everyone.  Their path was wrong.  10 years ago, Steve Jobs changed his attitude to phones.  The phone has ceased to be a phone, it has become a point of entry into the information space.  We even stopped worrying that all the phones are similar, this is not a status accessory, this is the norm.  There are several Android systems, iOS - they are all a physical interface for immersion in the infospace.  All work goes in the field of software development, artificial intelligence, cloud technologies.  The information space that we get through the phone has become much richer and more significant than the phone itself.  The way AI tells us that it will be useful to us this afternoon, the way we filter messages in social networks.  Standard features - increasing the quality of photography, killing the market for small cameras.  But it all comes down to the fact that there are social interactions that are more important than the phone itself. <br><br><img src="http://pics.livejournal.com/cadovod/pic/000gkyqe" alt="image"><br><br>  I read about space, but I'm not a big expert.  We had an interesting project - ‚ÄúSelenohod‚Äù.  Smirnov Design was the base for the project team, our engineers and designers implemented the ideas of the initiators of this project.  For me it was an amazing story.  When the guys came to us and said: "Help," we, of course, were impressed and immediately provided them with an office and employees.  This is a huge romanticism, this is energy, when you do something related to the cosmos.  It is still beyond human comprehension.  Unfortunately, our little rover did not fly anywhere, but we came into contact with space technologies and problems.  I realized how many factors that are not related to the emotional part at all are in this work.  We made an interesting product, original design, we had one of the most notable developments among all the world teams in the Google Google lunar x prize.  In this area, function is the ratio of 99.9999 to the remaining, which is external beauty.  Not a single gram for the sake of beauty can be in space, but at the same time, the views of people are riveted to space issues.  From the point of view of PR, this is important, because when Curiosity lands on Mars, hundreds of millions of people follow this with a sinking heart.  It's bad when there is no designer in the team. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b52/a60/5dd/b52a605dd7a4d359b8322685f5a4f08a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is great that within the framework of the ‚ÄúDays of Industrial Design in Skolkovo‚Äù there was an exhibition and performance of Galina Balashova, she also carries the energy and style of that school - our, Soviet, early.  Everything was very wisely built there.  I really want to invite her to Stroganovka for a lecture - she is the carrier of the energy of Soviet engineers, we must remember and understand this.  We had a hard generation gap.  My generation is people retired from engineering.  Now they love her again, but the engineers of the 90s are few.  I really would not like now to blur the thought - you need to focus on the big, on the great. <br><br>  <b>- Do you follow any branches and persons in terms of creativity?</b> <br><br>  - I do not have any idols, I watch what happens in general.  My team works guys who have idols, and I see how it affects the workflow.  I try to take a sober look at everything that stands behind a bright design, how it works as a business - in our time there are very interesting flashes.  For example, Ora Ito soared in an amazing way, I watched him.  Now, big business is complex - everything we see is often a show, so I don‚Äôt want to call anyone in principle.  It is always interesting for me to observe how super-brands and super-designers work, what stands behind it - which teams.  In Smirnov Design, I'm not the only one, my team.  I try to encourage my colleagues to participate in various events, such as the Industrial Design Days in Skolkovo, for example.  Now I teach in Stroganovka and opened the Center for Research and Innovation Development at the Academy, there are three major areas.  The laboratory of industrial design and engineering is headed by Ekaterina Grigorieva, the leading designer of Smirnov Design, a strong analyst and designer, the leader of the design team.  Also working with us are Ivan Shchipunov, Anya Reshetnikova, Dmitry Ponomarev, Nikita Makarov, a graduate of the Kosygin Russian State University, undergoes an internship.  There is a team behind me, I can‚Äôt do anything without a team, like everything else in the modern world of industrial design, so I always decipher the history of objects.  I consider my guys one of the best on the world level, I really appreciate them. <br><br>  <b>- What are your top 5 product designs?</b> <br><br>  - I will not call, let the youth think about it.

Or, distribute the procedures in such a way that a qualified specialist who has studied for 12 years can do three times as much and more efficiently simply due to proper usability, due to good interfaces, correct system design. All devices interact in this way, which increases the efficiency of work, when everything intuitively does not allow making mistakes. In order for an inexperienced nurse not to cripple a small child, the design puts things in order radically.</font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Recently we presented a battery that has been working for 50 years, how will it affect the design of medical equipment?
