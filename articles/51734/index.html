  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Shooting entertainment TV - take 2 (motor!)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This is the second article in a series on how various entertainment shows are filmed.  In the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/tv/51593/">last article,</a> we ended up with the fact that the film crew has at its disposal a studio ready for work, has scenarios, a filming plan and can solemnly start the film-making process. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Start shooting session </h4><br>  So, first of all, somewhere near the studio, a hardware room is being built (in general, it still goes along with the construction of the studio).  This is not done by the contracting companies, but by the film crew itself.  The hardware room is a room in which the director and a dozen other involved people will be located during the filming.  In hardware there is a lot of any iron.  In the first approximation, we will assume that there is a video console, a sound console and control monitors of cameras (in fact, even before the devil there is everything - it will be detailed in the third article).  Hardware located within 10-50 meters from the studio.  Two opposing goals are struggling here: first, it must be close, so that you can rush out to shout at the crowd, talk to the participants, look alive at the scenery, and on the other hand, have to be far away - so that the extra people don‚Äôt wander into the control room sounds and did not affect other distractions.  Often, at the request of the sound technicians, the hardware is sheathed with noise-absorbing material. <br><br>  In parallel, there is a camera exposure in the studio.  At the expense of the number of cameras - with less than 3 pieces, you can only shoot a children's matinee.  On the other hand, more than 10 pieces can not afford, probably, no one transmission.  On average, usually 4-6 cameras.  At their location, all sorts of tricky rules are used, in the spirit of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/180_degree_rule">‚Äú180 degrees rule‚Äù</a> , <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_degree_rule">‚Äúthe 30 degree rules‚Äù</a> and a whole bunch of other things.

      If in simple words - there must be cameras that allow you to take: <br>  - large plan of the leader (face, chest) <br>  - middle plan of the leader (all or almost the whole body) <br>  - large plan of the participant (player) <br>  - average participant plan <br>  -If there are several participants - all with their general plan. <br>  -leader and participant <br>  -the whole studio overall <br>  - if the presenter or participant is not in the studio from the very beginning, but from somewhere it comes out - there must be a camera that allows you to trace all the way from the exit to the studio location <br><br><h4>  Customization </h4><br>  Cameras, sound, light, video screens are configured.  The processes are interesting, will be described in detail later. <br><br><h4>  Filming schedule </h4><br>  The working day starts around 9 am and ends around 10 pm.  One shooting session - one and a half to two weeks (sometimes with days off, sometimes without).  Two to four programs are shot per day - i.e.  for one shooting session, it is possible to ensure about half a year of a weekly broadcast.  Here, too, some are shocking - how, the program, which I watch, was filmed not yesterday, but six months ago?  Yeah.  Well, maybe not half a year, but 3-4 months for sure.  This is not news.  Renting any kind of iron is daily (sometimes even hourly).  Here are removed all the programs for the season.  Very expensive in this regard is to convince the participants and the extras that the broadcast, which is being filmed in February, must be received in light T-shirts and shorts - after all, it will be aired in June.  And there is nothing here to bang your teeth in the unheated pavilion at -2 C!  It's summer now, you must be hot!  And the viewer must believe that this is something new, with the heat of the heat - and it will not look. <br><br><h4>  Extras </h4><br>  Once, when I was little, I dreamed very much to sit in the stands of a TV show.  This is so entertaining!  You can see famous leaders and stars, see the program before everyone else, and most importantly - you can, though briefly, but get into the TV!  And then it will be possible to watch this program with friends and family and scream enthusiastically: ‚ÄúHere!  Here I am!  The third row, the sixth from the left! ‚Äù <br><br>  I was young and naive.  All those who sit in the studio are either friends / relatives of the participants (ready to make any sacrifices for the sake of their favorite face), or extra money working for money.  And this work is not easy!  I repeat - working day from 9 am to 10 pm.  Salary - 400-500 rubles per day.  Lunch is often at your own expense.  Strict requirements for face, clothing, posture.  Army discipline in relation to the director's teams.  For the slightest chuckle is not a topic or a replica off-script expelled without money.  These are not actors, this is so - cannon fodder.  Pros?  What are the advantages ... Oh yes - free tea and crackers!  Everything.  As a matter of fact, they sit in the crowd not for the sake of money, but for the sake of those bright ideals described above, which have passed with my age, and some have not.  Among the extras there is their "main".  On this man hang up the earpiece, in which the director gives the command: "applause", "silence", "laughter."  Everyone else looks at him and does the same.  In fact, ‚Äúlaughter‚Äù is rarely said.  Unnatural laughter really hurts the ear, and if the truth is ridiculous - the studio itself will laugh. <br><br><h4>  Film crew </h4><br>  <b>Main director</b> <br>  He is one and omnipresent.  The ideologue of the process.  The person who receives all the laurels and all the entrances for the transfer.  The main boss and director of the universe within the studio.  Engaged in everything and fit everywhere.  The range of tasks is unlimited.  Apparently, it feeds from an atomic reactor, because the speed of thoughts and movements defies measurement. <br><br>  <b>Director Assistant (s)</b> <br>  They help as much as they can.  Communicate with the participants, while filming deals with the choice on the remote control the right plans from the right cameras at the right moments.  Work in close conjunction with the main director. <br><br>  <b>Operators</b> <br>  By the number of cameras.  In the case of using tricky cameras - sometimes 2 people per camera.  (On the "cunning" cameras - in the third article).  The work, in principle, is understandable - shooting: framing, escorting people, executing director's commands.  There is a main operator - he manages mainly at the stage of setting up and placing the cameras, coordinating with the director of the plans.  At the time of shooting, he controls little, because, as usual, he himself is behind one of the cameras. <br><br>  <b>Sound (s)</b> <br>  Usually 1-3 pieces.  They are responsible for the microphones of the presenter, the heroes and the guests, the ‚Äúinterception‚Äù of the presenter and the leader of the crowd, the studio‚Äôs common microphones, studio speakers, and the inclusion of all kinds of background music / beats.  Before filming it is funny to walk around the studio with microphones and talk to themselves - they are looking for sound pits. <br><br>  <b>Editor (s)</b> <br>  Responsible for everything that will be said, written or read during transmission.  As a rule, has a philological education.  He is responsible for the literacy of the presenter's phrases, the accuracy of the wording and generally for the logical connection of everything that happens to each other (‚ÄúYou said that in the third grade, you and the girl Masha grazed the cow Dawn - meet ... Dawn! That is, ugh ... Masha!‚Äù).  Together with the director develops the script and brings it to the attention of the presenter and participants. <br><br>  <b>Producer (s)</b> <br>  Major to get \ buy \ bring \ agree \ invite \ expel \ rent \ repair \ pay \ save.  Engage in all possible non-creative routine, in order to free from it the director, who must WORK!  Contact with contractors.  Dispose of money. <br><br>  <b>Admin (s)</b> <br>  These are such mini-producers.  They are doing essentially the same, but not at a strategic, but at a tactical level.  They contact with extras, guards, loaders and drivers, provide tea and crackers, drive cleaners, screw in broken light bulbs and recount props.  Tedious sho kapets, for often financially responsible. <br><br>  <b>Techniques</b> <br>  Iron must be set up and repaired.  People pushing buttons on the remotes and behind the cameras have no idea how it all plows and what's inside.  And technicians know.  Despite the importance of the work, the technicians are considered to be a sort of ‚Äúmobile‚Äù compared to ‚Äúcreative‚Äù people.  Of course, no one tells them this directly, but the edge is felt. <br><br>  <b>Svetoviki</b> <br>  There is one main svetovik - it is in the control room and, following the instructions of the director (sometimes the main operator), switches the lighting programs.  There are several auxiliary ones - they hang from the ceiling and control the "light guns".  (Unintelligible words? Read the following article in the cycle.) <br><br>  <b>Miscellaneous support staff</b> <br>  Drivers, guards, movers, cleaners, couriers, etc.  Functions, however, are understandable, we will not linger. <br><br><h4>  Directly shooting </h4><br>  After describing everything above, the shooting process is already in principle clear.  The beginning is a discussion with the moderator, the participants, the director and the script editor.  If the participants are real - just an explanation of the rules of the game and go ahead!  If the actors - explained in detail the role and order of each replica.  In any case, the moderator is told what you can get used to in this particular person (‚ÄúYou wrote in your profile that you love children - and this is a matter of jurisdiction!‚Äù).  The transmission begins.  Exit lead.  Greetings.  Explanation of the rules.  Presentation of participants.  Start.  In the course of the transfer, everything goes according to the script.  In the event of a change in plans, the director speaks about this to the presenter in the ‚Äúinterception‚Äù (the order of questions has changed, or this participant is tired and it is necessary to drown him).  All services work in concert and, as a rule, everything goes well.  If incidents do not happen.  And they happen!  Once in the intellectual game one fresh one-day star was invited.  But it turned out to be so stupid that it would not have gotten further than the first question.  And then they decided to give her answers to the first questions 5. Learn.  It's all over the scandal.  She answered the third question before the host asked him.  And then confused the answers to the fourth and fifth.  The hall sobbed, the presenter blushed, and at least she was sitting for himself, clapping his ears.  The transmission was in the furnace.  By the way, in all games for money (and in some not for money), players sign a document about ‚Äúaccepting the rules and keeping up the shooting‚Äù.  With heavy fines.  And yet - with all these "hundreds of thousands" and "millions" of winning players, a tax is withheld - something around 30%.  Although the winnings themselves as compared with the budgets of programs are usually 5-7%.  Rarely more. <br><br>  Upon completion of the first successfully removed the transfer is usually fortunately broken plate.  In ancient Rome, after filming, they sacrificed the gods of the youngest and most beautiful member of the film crew.  Now just a plate. <br><br><h4>  Installation </h4><br>  Stage is no less important than shooting.  Here it is necessary to cut out the prolonged dialogue, choose the most successful of the three plans, choose a moment for advertising, make the transfer of the desired duration, etc.  But this is still half the battle.  Special talent has to be shown when something went wrong during filming: a spotlight or a ‚Äúeavesdropping‚Äù of one of the guests / participants broke, there was a bug in the scenery (a suddenly broken floor or a distorted wall is a common thing).  Shooting due to the specifics of broadcasts can often not be stopped - people play for a while or for money, and most importantly - after stopping and restarting, there will be no drive, shine in the eyes, reaction to surprises, etc.  Exactly in such cases, the magic power of installation manifests itself.  You can not imagine from what city ... sometimes they make that candy that you see on the screen. <br><br><h4>  Final stage </h4><br>  The shooting ended.  At this stage a pause is made.  Removed gear lasts for several months.  The film crew can rest (do another project).  Broadcasts go on the air.  It is mandatory for each issue and for the transfer as a whole is measured rating.  Based on these data, a month and a half before the end of the ‚Äústrategic stock‚Äù of the captured programs, the decision is made whether to continue this project or not.  If yes - goto start.  Some of the papers and preparatory materials can be reigned, some - no.  If the ratings are bad - thanks to everyone, everyone is free. <br><br>  The third article about the hardware and software used is coming soon. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51734/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51734/</a></p>
