Why do I need this device, if I have a stationary computer at home and a normal 17-inch laptop?  I love, you know, to read before bedtime, lying on the couch.  Use for this bulky heavy laptop is not convenient.  By the way, about a year ago, the Sony PRS 505 electronic reader was purchased for the same purpose. However, it did not satisfy. <br><br><h6>  Lyrical digression (You can skip) </h6>  The reasons why Sony PRS 505 "did not satisfy": <ol><li>  A small set of supported formats. <br>  About fb2 and Djvu, I generally keep quiet.  But I wanted to read a book in chm format.  I spent the day testing various converters, but never got a good result. </li><li>  Small font and small screen. <br>  Most PDF files do not scale at all, the picture fits entirely into this tiny screen, while the fields of 2 cm for the reader, of course, are simply necessary (probably, to write Fermat's theorem there :)).  That would be fine, but even ordinary txt has only 3 scales.  My eyesight is so weak, and by evening my eyes get tired at all - I want to somehow be a little bigger. </li><li>  No screen backlighting. <br>  No matter what the manufacturers of liquid ink say - like, looking like 100% plain paper is not true.  The lamp behind the head in this screen flashes - you still need to find a position so that it does not shine. </li><li>  And most importantly - no internet. <br>  Of course, it is nice to read the classics, but somehow I have been lately more and more inconvenient to actual information, which is all on the net. </li></ol><br>  Apparently, based on these criteria, the iPad would be for me just right.  But, first, when he still appears.  And secondly, fans forgive me, I don‚Äôt like Apple - all these completely artificial artificial restrictions - tuna, upstor, etc.  Another year later, similar devices will appear in Samsung, Sony, Asus, Aser, and then we will see. <br><h6>  End of lyrical digression. </h6><br>  So, I decided to buy a netbook in the USA.  Criteria: <br><ol><li>  Small, no more than 10 inches, but that it was convenient to read, therefore, no less. </li><li>  The lighter the better there. </li><li>  The price does not play a special role (within reasonable limits) </li><li>  OS - NOT Windows 7 Starter (Windows without Windows Explorer is a mockery).  That is, either XP or the normal seven.  (Linux has not matured to me yet :)) </li><li>  "Equipment" is the most innovative. </li></ol><br>  The last criterion will be explained separately.  Now IT is developing so rapidly, and you want the device to last longer.  Here, for example, when I bought a WiFi router (and this seemed to be recently), the n standard was not yet available.  And now they shove him into all the glands.  Some HTML5.5 will appear in half a year, and the old Atom will not pull it ... In particular, I wanted, of course, that ION was in quality of graphics, but I did not find less than 12 inches, and 12 already for me - checked it.

      It would be possible to order something in advance in some American online store and pick up on arrival.  But when I was in the states about a year ago, all the stores were simply inundated with various models of netbooks and laptops.  And hold the device in your hands before buying - it is always nice.  Therefore, I decided to buy on the spot.  Here I screwed up - did not take into account the crisis factor.  It must be said that, unlike Russia, the financial crisis did not affect America in words.  For me, it turned out to be important that almost all computer stores (CompUSA, CircutCity, etc.) closed their points of sale and went online.  And for those that have no choice whatsoever - a pair of some kind of antediluvian laptops at an exorbitant price and that‚Äôs all. <br>  After clarifying this, I had to urgently search for and order something on the Internet.  Because after a week to leave, and delivery may not have time. <br>  And here I sit, I study eBay, and right before my eyes there is a proposal made in the title of the device.  And in the course of the next hour, about a dozen of similar offers appear.  On the Asus site by the time there is no mention of this device.  Nevertheless, I find out that Asus has recently demonstrated this model as a new model in 2010 and is going to start selling in February.  Since it was still in January, then, apparently, the sales started ahead of the promised time. <br>  I must say that by that time I was already holding model 1005HA in my hands.  I remember that I didn‚Äôt like a very sleek glossy case, an unusual and in my opinion not convenient arrangement of the arrow keys, an old N270 processor, and a somewhat clumsy look.  The new model is devoid of all these shortcomings.  Therefore, my thoughts were short-lived, and I bought it.  Asus delayed the shipment for another couple of days, but everything ended well - I received a package on the last day of the trip. <br><br>  Here are the specs of what I acquired: <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  OS </td><td>  Windows 7 Home Premium </td></tr><tr><td>  Display </td><td>  10.1 "LED Backlight WSVGA Screen (1024x600) </td></tr><tr><td>  CPU </td><td>  Intel Atom N450 </td></tr><tr><td>  Memory </td><td>  DDR2 SO-DIMM 2GB </td></tr><tr><td>  WiFi </td><td>  802.11b / g / n </td></tr><tr><td>  Bluetooth </td><td>  V2.1 </td></tr><tr><td>  HDD </td><td>  320GB 2.5 ‚ÄùSATA2 5400rpm </td></tr><tr><td>  Camera </td><td>  1.3M Pixels </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>  Stereo Speakers </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>  Digital array mic </td></tr><tr><td>  Input / output </td><td>  1 x Mini VGA Connector <br>  2 x USB 2.0 <br>  1 x LAN RJ-45 <br>  2 x Audio Jack (Headphone / Mic-in) </td></tr><tr><td>  Card reader </td><td>  MMC / SD (SDHC) </td></tr><tr><td>  Battery </td><td>  Slim and eco-friendly Li-polymer battery, 6hrs * </td></tr><tr><td>  Dimensions </td><td>  262mm (W) x 180mm (D) x 26.2mm (H) </td></tr><tr><td>  Weight </td><td>  1.145kg (2.53lbs) </td></tr><tr><td>  Infusion </td><td>  Coffee brown </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : It cost me $ 540 (actually, it sold for $ 499, but there is a tricky purchase tax from California to California). <br><br>  I satisfied all my needs.  However, there are also disadvantages. <br>  <b>Pluses (unexpected for me):</b> <br><ol><li>  I liked the outer covering very much - a matte corrugated surface, no ‚Äúprints‚Äù. </li><li>  I was pleasantly struck by the stereo sound from the built-in speakers (or am I just behind the times and is it all like that now?) </li><li>  Almost not heated. </li></ol>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br><ol><li>  The screen is still glossy - where do without it. </li><li>  Plugs for all the "holes" give beauty, but take away the convenience - you have to sulk in order to insert a flash drive or headphones (can just tear them off?) </li><li>  Weak battery (but easily removable).  When watching movies (regular avi, not HD) lasts for 5 hours.  When my use is not critical, but if you use it for long trips, you need to buy spare batteries (they say that in Europe this model will be sold with a spare battery in the kit). </li></ol><br><br>  And finally, some pictures: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/824/048/ca8/824048ca84a4ac9c56e0735f4a83711a.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/83f/92d/09f/83f92d09fc85db15822340bc2f918f24.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/043/8ce/018/0438ce01820b000ba1ae0a03d51b94ba.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/462/479/855/462479855c31a6e0cb700e4fd0524942.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/338/6b8/9e3/3386b89e3d75be0deda9da9ef0f42668.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6ff/922/c18/6ff922c183606f46391a3079548631d7.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/892/96f/8c0/89296f8c04d540ec29dc5f20fed140ab.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d95/24f/822/d9524f8227ad0c365e37c927629f8333.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dbf/bf0/096/dbfbf009668b5c2865210e834f610444.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84684/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84684/</a></p>
