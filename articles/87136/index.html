  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Phone selection: freedom and reality</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  By and large, all of the following is the fruit of my sick imagination, which arose against the backdrop of the flowering of thematic blogs about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/android/">Android</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/nokia/">Nokia</a> and even the emergence <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/special/nokia/maemo/">of the Maemo promo page</a> , to which, ironically, I can see a link only when viewing Habr from the N900 :) <br><br>  Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt find a blog about a spherical mobile in a vacuum on Habr√©, so while I‚Äôm writing to a personal one, maybe some readers will tell you where to drag it if the idea suddenly interests the public. <br><br>  Let's remember the moment when mobile phones are no longer a luxury - the end of the nineties.  Then a cell phone could easily weigh a pound and could only do one thing: make calls and, if expensive, vibrate on an incoming call, show time and be an alarm clock.

      <i>Around the same time, by the way, a good laptop had a performance and memory comparable to modern cell phones - this is important.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let us now recall the variety of <i>desktop</i> operating systems that could be tried (without touching the server systems) <i>at that moment</i> : Windows (95 and forth), OS / 2, at the same time a mass of linux with graphical shells began to appear.  What is common between them?  That's right - for money or for free, they could be installed on a computer and solve a number of everyday tasks: go online, work, play games that run under the selected OS.  However, the situation with the variety of operating systems for desktop or laptop PCs has not changed radically since, moreover, it has improved due to the expansion of the variety of systems attracting the end user, and, perhaps, improvements in compatibility (partly due to iron unification).  We note, by the way, that the number of <i>leading</i> desktop and mobile operating systems is numerically the same within the limits of the order, as, by and large, and the platforms on which modern smart phones are built. <br><br>  Let's go back now: what do we have? <br><br>  <b>On the one hand: a</b> modern cell phone (smartphone, communicator - the name does not roll) is comparable in performance, memory capacity and display resolution with a laptop three to five years old. <br><br>  <b>On the other:</b> endless flours of consumer choice.  As an example, I myself: I would have thought about acquiring an iPhone if he had a full qwerty keyboard.  I like the variety of choices in iTunes, I like the soundness of the interface, but I cannot use the on-screen keyboard without tactile feedback. <br><br>  At the same time, I really like the ideology of Maemo / MeeGo: creating an open system for a phone that is theoretically (and in practice) compatible with desktop application software. <br><br>  Why did I start all this? <br><br>  I look forward to the moment when it comes to the producers of clever cellular ones that the device is <b>a platform, the OS for which the consumer has the right to choose</b> . <br><br>  Why the hell is running <a href="http://maemos.ru/2010/01/26/windows95-nokia-n900-maemo/">Windows on the n900</a> - this is a lot of fans who understand what DOSBox is and are not afraid of the word ‚Äúconsole‚Äù at all?  (Ok, I agree, win95 is not a completely correct example, but what kind of toys were there in adolescence, eh?) <br><br>  Generally speaking, I am surprised that the same Microsoft, which Apple, Android and Intel + Nokia seriously pursue, has not yet thought that the OS can be adapted to the architecture?  The same Maemo, damn it, is Linux, which, if desired, can be pushed anywhere. <br><br>  In my opinion, the current situation is worthy of some European antitrust proceedings, as a result of which mobile iron manufacturers must provide the end user with a choice of operating system (perhaps several) for their device - then there will indeed be freedom of choice on the market. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87136/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87136/</a></p>
