      I am familiar with companies whose sales departments number up to sixty people. <br>  As a rule, the working time of sales managers is strictly divided into stages carefully monitored by management. <br>  Stages and their sequence may differ slightly in relation to different companies, but the essence is identical. <br><br>  For example: <br>  From 9 to 10 - preparing reports and sending commercial offers. <br>  From 10 to 13 - continuous "cold calls" - the offer of services. <br>  From 13 to 14 - lunch time. <br>  From 14 to 17 - ‚Äúcold calls‚Äù and communication with customers. <br>  From 17 to 18 - preparing reports and sending commercial offers. <br><br>  For full control, there is a tactical unit, <br>  referred to as "supervisor." <br>  Control is exercised over virtually every step of the workers (in particular, they are monitored: moving around the offices, visited sites, telephone conversations - up to listening), which, due to human nature, cannot but cause conscious or unconscious opposition.  Especially if one takes into account the fact that practically any deviation from the given framework is fraught with the use of a penalty. <br><br>  Of course, the sales manager is an employee whose salary depends entirely on his quickness, but the working conditions described briefly above, in my opinion, do not contribute to the long-term maintenance of the seller‚Äôs performance. <br>  <em>I believe that such a categorical form of management is unacceptable if the company is interested in the long presence of competent employees in its staff, but I already wrote about this in previous articles.</em> <br><br>  At the same time, there are practically no methods of non-material motivation. <br>  Strange as it may sound, it‚Äôs not as easy as it may seem, to endlessly identify such a stressful activity with its monetary equivalent (this is also aggravated by wage instability). <br>  Based on this, it can be argued that in the long run, even a successful manager ‚Äúburns out‚Äù and it is almost impossible to rehabilitate him. <br><br>  The natural desire to distract, change the situation just to feel their own freedom in no case can not be completely suppressed.  Minutes of rest during working hours are much more pleasant than at the hour caused by the lunch break. <br>  And, as a result, a more loyal and, if I may say so, easy attitude to work. <br><br>  I offer the following. <br><br>  The company hires (albeit, for example, one) a new employee. <br>  This may be a student working half a day (in principle, a total of several hours of his presence is enough). <br>  Employee requirements should be as follows: <br>  It should be a charming young man (perhaps a girl, but, in my opinion, it is still better if it is a man), with good appearance, able to maintain a pleasant unobtrusive conversation, and he should also be able to naturally begin and end the conversation. <br>  It is better if he is well-read, and is familiar with some psychological nuances of communication.  I repeat, it is even preferable to be a psychology student. <br>  His responsibilities will be to maintain the positive mood of the staff within the departments. <br><br>  According to legend, this can be an advertising manager or any other employee who occupies a fairly significant position. <br><br>  His work will consist of a lively, natural communication with managers. <br>  For example, in the morning, at the beginning of the working day, he can go to one of the offices with a cup of coffee, <br>  crouch in a free chair and just chat with someone, controlling the dialogue so that the employee feels his goodwill and positive mood in general. <br>  If possible, he can connect others to this conversation, discuss and joke with them. <br>  Fifteen minutes of such communication with the department of 20 people is enough, after which the employee must also unobtrusively retire. <br><br>  At the same time, it is important that managers realize that this employee occupies a fairly high position.  So they will listen more to him, tune in to his mood.  It makes sense also unobtrusively, literally in a couple of words, to signify one‚Äôs loyalty to the company in general and the staff of this department in particular. <br>  For example: - You have so much fun, you sit a little. <br><br>  The practical implementation of the proposal, in my opinion, will allow balancing the various aspects of the interaction ‚Äúleader - subordinate‚Äù. <br><br>  Employees, realizing that a person occupying a fairly responsible position can condescend to simply communicating with them, will be seen in a friend‚Äôs manual, that is, they will be more trusting and loyal to the management team. <br>  A quarter of an hour of free communication during working hours will significantly raise your spirits. <br>  a team. <br>  Employees will see that a successful employee takes his duties easily and naturally, while successfully coping with them, which can serve as an example. <br><br>  Keeping an employee in the workplace for no more than half a working day will also cost the company very little. <br>  It seems to me that the use of this measure can significantly affect the team spirit of employees, but, of course, practical experiments are required. <br><br>  I would appreciate any comments, questions and amendments. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21998/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21998/</a></p>
