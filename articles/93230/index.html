And the whole world is not enough!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The choice of housing is often many users postpone finally.  Often I had to meet, as people pick up more expensive components, and save on the case.  This approach, in my opinion, is absolutely not acceptable.  It is enough to compare the computer with the person, and the body with its clothes - and you will immediately understand where I'm going.  How you dress, so you yourself feel.  You can dress expensive and feel uncomfortable, and you can dress with taste, but feel comfortable in it.  Surely, each of you have your favorite sneakers or T-shirt.  And now I have a favorite corps.  Free space in my mind, allotted for your favorite corps, took the product from the company NZXT called Tempest Evo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fbf/584/4ed/fbf5844edc67d99c8b842ef8d08475c2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Be careful, lots of pictures! <a name="habracut"></a>

      Tempest Evo is designed to protect against overheating.  This idea was based on the developers of the NZXT. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4be/3c1/dd7/4be3c1dd768b6f5c4ebdd8bc033cffb6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The top panel is very conveniently located 2 USB ports, one eSATA, connectors for connecting a microphone and headphones, as well as the power and reboot buttons.  Placing additional USB and other ports on top is an obvious plus, because you do not need to bend over once more to find USB.  And you can just not be afraid to break the flash drive passing by the computer) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2bd/dba/5e1/2bddba5e1e40aa322b443e3cc360adb5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition to the connectors on top, NZXT introduced the first echelon of protection against overheating.  Two 140mm blower fans will help remove heat from the processor and near-socket space.  I found another use for these coolers after several hours of work with this case.  In place of the fans it is convenient to put a cup of coffee or tea, it really cools a little faster.  But the chances of reducing the life of your PC, strait it all, greatly increased.  Be careful! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a97/3b4/836/a973b4836e2c9030d36b28f9b1adab46.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the back of the case there is another blower fan, but this time it is already 120mm.  Also, the developers left room for the hoses from the water cooling system. <br><br><img src="http://img695.imageshack.us/img695/7959/027ro.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The power supply is located below, which has become a good tone for gaming enclosures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9db/86a/3cd/9db86a3cdc5c3b24ed81ad61b4690e56.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The side cover has a transparent window that will probably be liked by modding fans, or simply by fans of different neon lamps.  A 120mm fan is embedded in the window, designed to blow a video card with cold air. <br><br>  And now some insides: <br><br><img src="http://img190.imageshack.us/img190/7336/036qp.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://img197.imageshack.us/img197/8128/037kz.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2a5/fba/59f/2a5fba59f879b25d5e158d2d7b521858.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ef7/6cf/2dc/ef76cf2dc0d7f4be300ab4b6cb612b8d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Inside the case is made qualitatively, that the most important thing is no sharp edges.  For some time I had to collect 3-5 computers per day, and very often I received abrasions due to poor-quality cases.  Naturally, there is some of my inexperience in this, but with Tempest Evo I didn‚Äôt have any problems during the assembly process.  The package bundle is quite rich, a bunch of wires inside the case just seems huge, and in fact there are only connectors for connecting the top panel, as well as fans.  Bolts and spare slides are also not superfluous, they were poured even with a small margin. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/912/90d/4b5/91290d4b53d3e93568ff394eda00d2e1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  To check the temperature parameters, I assembled the following system: <br><br>  Intel Core 2 Quad Q8300 <br>  Asus p5qd turbo <br>  2x2Gb Kingston HyperX DDR2 800MHz <br>  Cooler Master 850W <br>  WD 1Tb Green <br><br><img src="http://img522.imageshack.us/img522/4789/tempestevo.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In idle, the minimum temperature was 31 degrees Celsius, and the maxims - 39 degrees.  Which is not bad.  check the temperature under load. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3e5/d34/1a5/3e5d341a5dfa6a7d482163c03c33e5ff.png" alt="image"><br><br>  After a 25 minute load of LinX, the maximum temperature reached 56 degrees.  This can be called a success, as three more corps tested by me showed the worst results.  (but we'll talk about them another time) <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  I was very pleased with the NZXT Tempest Evo.  Pleasant appearance, ergonomic interior layout, good temperature characteristics - in my opinion, the main merits of the developers.  Of course, nothing is perfect, and the body has one small drawback.  To cope with high temperatures, the engineers of NZXT had to use quite noisy fans.  But they do an excellent job even with powerful systems, but for me this is much more important. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93230/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93230/</a></p>
