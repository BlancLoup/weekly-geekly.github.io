Anyway, from me. <br><br>  Lukyanenko with his Moscow vampires, apparently, stumbled right on the gold mine.  Many people liked to read and watch a slightly modified reality.  " <a href="http://beauty-n-beast.livejournal.com/89931.html">Standing on the Moscow River</a> " describes events that take place in the near future, and the author, beauty_n_beast, calls this action "liberpank."  Lukyanenko at the beginning of the paragraph, I mentioned tokmo fashion for the sake of, the story on the link and the author of "Watches of All Russia" have nothing in common with the story.  beauty_n_beast has created a very realistic picture of how tanks, with the support of NATO, are going to beat Moscow off the chocks (sorry if anyone offended by this word).  A lieutenant colonel, a lieutenant, and a brigadier general are sorting out a relationship on the Moscow ring road.  Well, it turned out almost a short content of the film.

      <a href="http://susamo.net.ru/">Susamin</a> in his blog talks about the <a href="http://susamo.net.ru/2006/01/30/informatsionnaja_vojna">information war</a> .  Residents of the entrance are trying to unite in front of the impending threat of resettlement, and someone diligently prevents them.  Mini-wars in one single yard. <br><br>  A woman with a sweet surname Volkova turned <a href="http://volkova-ru.livejournal.com/338619.html">30 years old</a> .  No, I am not familiar with her, but I can‚Äôt say with complete confidence about you.  So, Volkova describes his feelings from this age.  Perhaps girls / girls / women will be interested to read this note and compare with their emotions.  At what age does a woman feel best?  Is it possible to be pleased with your figure, having given birth and nourished two children?  And anyway, when is old age? <br><br>  Sell ‚Äã‚ÄãMe convinces all of us to be careful with our desires, because, for example, they tend to come true with him.  The note entitled " <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/SellMe%3Fm%3D416">1181 words about desires and their fulfillment</a> " is replete with strange coincidences and mystical events.  All characters are real. <br><br>  In the community of the glorious city of Minsk, among the senseless political messages, there are sometimes quite funny ones.  This week I was amused by the note " <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/minsk_by/781067.html">Master class for unscrupulous, but polite: how not to pay in 100 ke!</a> ".  Almost a real scientific study using psychology and everyday experience.  I will note that this record will be interesting not only to the residents of Minsk, but also to all citizens who travel by public transport. <br><br>  We continue the theme of the master classes, Steel Romantic recalls <a href="http://xxperience.livejournal.com/64871.html">30 of his former girlfriends</a> and tells us why he broke up with them.  I recommend quietly throwing this list to my passions so that they reflect on their behavior :-).  Just do it as discreetly as possible, otherwise you will be included in her list of 30 former ones. <br><br>  Finally, thanks to our newspaper, you will learn all about sex!  Um, the editor strictly says to me here that ‚ÄúKV‚Äù is quite about the other and waving thoughtfully in front of the nose with scissors.  Hints that I need a haircut?  Meanwhile, the fragile young minds can attack the encyclopedia " <a href="http://pvphome.livejournal.com/44525.html">All about sex</a> ", which tells us about Paul Protasov.  There are pictures and mocking comments of Paul.  Do not worry about your morality - there is nothing forbidden in the images.  Agree, for the encyclopedia about sex is a bit strange.  Healthy laughter is guaranteed. <br><br>  I will continue the topic of sex.  That is the topic of study.  In Misunthrop's Irregular Memoirs, I found a wonderful story <a href="http://just-sol.livejournal.com/33962.html">about the great power of enlightenment</a> .  Education does not allow me to talk about the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe story, but I strongly recommend reading this story to girls aged 18-19.  I hope there are such among the readers of "KV"?  My God, what am I doing?  I turn a solid newspaper into a Kama Sutra ... <br><br>  Once again I draw your attention to the blog <a href="http://coldflow.blogspot.com/">Cold Flow</a> , this time all novice writers amicable crowd sent to read " <a href="http://coldflow.blogspot.com/2006/01/blog-post_113837027769286572.html">My bloody boys ...</a> ".  From this message they will be able to learn all the syndromes that are inherent to novice writers.  If you are not so / such, you will still have to read this note, because the outlook is fun and expanding (no, nothing happens to the pupils). <br><br>  And now turn our sated look at the photo-collection.  This I warn you that the following links will be a lot of pictures, which may take a long time to load.  So, Mitrich publishes in his LiveJournal a wonderful series of photos of Lyndon Wade (Lyndon Wade) <a href="http://mi3ch.livejournal.com/700001.html">12 months from the life of a hotel room</a> .  Beautiful and professional work, which absolutely does not need my advertising - just go and see. <br><br>  Kay1313 offers us its hit parade of the best <a href="http://kay1313.livejournal.com/77589.html">female drivers for 2005</a> .  Photos, of course, are attached.  This suggests a quite logical conclusion - only a strong half of humanity knows how to drive cars correctly!  Yeah, I've always been against feminism.  I foresee the indignation of the beautiful half of the editorial staff of KV, but I will not change my opinion even under the threat of non-receipt of wages!  I hope Larisa Mintel will not use scary editorial scissors?  :-) (no comment - live, Alexey, :-) - LM) <br><br>  Blog <a href="http://getnew.biz/">New Business</a> comes into our review with the wonderful question " <a href="http://getnew.biz/2006/01/24/marketing-ne-rabotaet">Is Marketing Not Working?</a> ".  Of course, this honor was awarded not to the question itself, but to a note in which it is proved that it still works!  Even I believed it and went to change my old, worn jacket for the same from Brioni for $ 30,000. <br><br>  Sometimes journalists (I confess, I am among them) publish unverified information, and then they laugh and show a finger.  Basia shows on his own example how it is very easy <a href="http://flashtuchka.livejournal.com/392975.html">to invent a duck</a> , which in a blink of an eye will spread through the media.  So I see how poor content managers working on news sites try to redo this news so that it is not like the others.  World entropy is clearly turning into an avalanche. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.umade.ru/log/">Umade.ru</a> continues to teach me the <a href="http://www.umade.ru/log/">tricks of</a> CSS.  A large article " <a href="http://www.umade.ru/log/2006/01/171.html">CSS: Tips and Tricks, Part 1</a> " will be very useful for beginners in site building and interesting for experienced web developers.  Even such a narrow-minded character, like me, imbued with text and for about three hours poked around in the CSS of my site. <br><br>  In LJ with a mathematical name UmnoZhenie quite large <a href="http://friend-horatio.livejournal.com/294396.html">confession strippers</a> .  Here you read such revelations and it seems that it is quite a normal profession, romantic.  In strippers I would go, let them teach me!  True, they don‚Äôt even want to take me into the army, but we all know that only people who have served in the army are taken to striptease.  Apparently, no luck. <br><br>  <a href="http://berk.org.ua/">Berks Blog!</a>  advertises us to <a href="http://berk.org.ua/index.php%3Fentry%3Dentry060129-171631">Eugene Grishkovets</a> .  Familiar with the work of this wonderful actor and narrator follow the link and watch photos.  Those who are not familiar, blush with shame and follow the link to get acquainted.  Incidentally, I also blush and go along with the latter. <br><br>  It is worth noting that this week a <a href="http://caffetalks.com/">bloggers forum</a> appeared.  Personally, I do not see much point in opening it, bloggers are unlikely to be his regulars, they are more accustomed to communicate in the comments to the posts.  But for beginners and those who are thinking of starting a blog, it will be useful to visit this forum. <br><br>  In our "Blog Reviews" real bloggers continue to be noted!  This time, the author of the " <a href="http://ouch.kiev.ua/">Details</a> " blog presents his vision of the past week: <br>  "It is not surprising that the past week in blogs was held in the discussion of warming and weather. The cats first felt warmly, and, having decided that spring came, began to sing their cat songs. January 25 is not only Tatiana's day, but also <a href="http://jamshid.ru/2006/01/25/den-rozhdeniya-vyisotskogo">V.'s birthday S. Vysotsky</a> . January is not over yet, and many are preparing for the next holiday - <a href="http://iflake.org.ru/logbuch/2006/01/26/love">Valentine's Day</a> . Someone <a href="http://setti.biz/343">finds friends</a> . But there are enough <a href="http://kiev2000.com/meet/mates.asp">resources on the Web to search for friends</a> , for example, as well as relatively suitable <a href="http://copy.ru/">copy.ru</a> or <a href="http://moikrug.ru/">moikrug. ru</a> .
