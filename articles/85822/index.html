  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Idea: we learn foreign words with books</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Have you ever caught yourself thinking that sometimes it is easier to say a word in another language than to remember a word with a suitable meaning in your native language?  I had this often enough.  From here the idea was born recently.  Not original, but as an ‚Äúaddition‚Äù to the already existing methods of ‚Äúlearning‚Äù foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äã(FL).  I am absolutely unable to create such a service / program, therefore I post it here. <br><br><h4>  The essence </h4><br>  Let us consider the example of fiction books.  The user selects any popular / favorite book, the program / service processes it before reading in a special way: indexes words in the book by occurrence and replaces it with translation words from page to page more / more often (sort of gradient). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Rough example </h4><br>  The book has 5 pages.  On the first, the program completely makes the Russian page, on the second page - on 1/4 translates the text into another language, on the third page - on 2/4, on the fourth - 3/4 and on the last one to consolidate completely.  BUT, since there are usually quite a few pages in a book, you can make a ‚Äúgradient‚Äù of translatable words smooth, and the user will already learn some words as they read.  There are almost no books where from page to page the composition of words changes completely (well, except for dictionaries, but not about them). <br><br><h4>  Important </h4><br><ul><li>  So that the user starts reading in his native language, and finishes in a foreign language.  To first get into the outline of the story, the storyline and the world of the story, and then "guess" the meaning of words within the meaning of the whole sentence around the word.  Therefore, a popular book is needed, or a user's favorite book. </li><li>  The most common words in the book need to be replaced first - they will be easier to understand, they are most often used further, which will help them remember better and create a contextual basis for memorizing other words. </li><li>  If a book is short or the repeatability of words in it is low, it‚Äôs better not to fully translate the pages by the end, but to leave a jumble </li><li>  Have a general ranking of the occurrence / usability / importance of words in a foreign language, in order to replace the first words most important for understanding the entire language, and not the specials.  technical terms that can be inundated with the text, OR to ask the user in which area he wants to learn maximum words, and in which he doesn‚Äôt need to know at all, well, and other tastes </li><li>  The ability to remind a word (again instantly / by clicking, translate tapu) is also not worth taking away - you never know :) </li></ul>

    <h4>  Total </h4><br>  By the end of reading the work with virtually no dictionary, the user will remember a fairly large number of words.  And here words should be entered into the database, distributed by readability and other ratings of the message ... But this is only for memorizing words. <br><br>  Grammar should be entered either on the last pages of large books, or not at all - here it is necessary to think more ... <br><br>  Well, something like that :) I will be glad to discuss and bring to the "mind" </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85822/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85822/</a></p>
