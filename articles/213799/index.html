Soon the sales manager is not only a high-level negotiator, but also an IT specialist, at least in some areas. <br><br>  <b>What technology is needed</b> <br><br>  How to increase the number of negotiations ending with a profitable solution?  (higher business schools have said goodbye to Win-Win long ago) Or how to increase the quality and quantity of deals made?  For this we need the technology of additional reality, we also take the latest knowledge from the field of psychology and two electronic lenses. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What is an electronic lens, you can read on the Internet.  The essence is simple: the usual lens with a translucent matrix that performs the function of the display (alas, there is now more as a concept).  With the help of the phenomenon of magnetic induction it can be powered at a distance from the transmitter, and with the help of a radio signal - the image.  It remains only to put in your phone pocket (he is the transmitter of the image) and now you are watching TV with lenses for your eyes.  True, we need two lenses.  One in the form of a screen, and the second in the form of a sensitive, translucent CCD matrix.  Or think about where to put the camera so that the latter will record the face of the interlocutor.

You can use translucent matrices inside the vitreous body of the eye, you can implement special optics, but all this applies to clearly not realizable ideas in the next few years.  Therefore, we will work in the old manner. <br><br>  Now what? <br><br>  Have you heard about the facial coding system?  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D1%2585_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9">FACS for</a> short.  She then we need.  A brief history: for 40 years now there has been a system that allows one to read a person‚Äôs emotions by the position of the facial muscles.  It does not use the standard understanding of smiles / frowns, but the whole system of codes assigned to each individual muscle in each individual position.  In summation, the muscles give a certain expression to your face, just as the codes of all the muscles add up and form a long code that characterizes the emotion.  But if some kind of muscle falls out of the unified code, which must precisely form an emotion, then this is not all right with the person.  For example, he smiles, but he lies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/811/08a/b89/81108ab8996c05a327d0b715387d5b45.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  This system is actively used by foreign psychologists, special services and animators.  Yes, the animator of 3D movies.  Using the FACS system, they give real, sincere faces to cartoon characters, but this is not about now. <br><br>  So.  We are interested in - if the programs are capable of calculating these codes on the face and showing in real time, a certain graph on which it will be seen that a person hides something, deceives, does not trust the manager or wants to buy, because somewhere deep in his brain are you excited? <br><br>  Take the example of such a program: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/n8wJ8tjmnmU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhirAYFijBqjMlhH_Bwf_2jJlm0vRw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Add to all this the analysis of emotions by voice timbre (with the help of an inconspicuous microphone - at least where it should go, why immediately in the eye or the ear) and proceed to the next stage. <br><br>  <b>Application.</b> <br><br>  What will happen if, after 10 years, you find an advertisement on the net with such a text: ‚ÄúThere is someone standing in front of you about whom you know nothing, but really want to know.  And this is more than a dossier collected by your department or a quick analysis of some indirect evidence.  Communicate with the other person, persuade him or make him doubt.  Now in business negotiations you will be able to understand exactly what your partner and his lawyer think.  If you sell - catch the optimal moment of sales, do not wait - if the system tells you that now is the optimal time to sell a product or sign a contract - act! ‚Äù <br><br>  The result: you get an image of the interlocutor's face in one eye, the program in the phone processes the FACS codes and shows the person‚Äôs emotions, displaying the lenses of the second eye on the display.  Such a system (additionally including automatic prompts, what to talk about at the moment, analyzing what has already been said and the human response), together with a properly structured training system for the manager, targeting data (hello from BigData), will help increase sales and increase the number of successful negotiations. <br><br>  <b>Different future.</b> <br><br>  Guess what the future will be, a difficult task.  If you look at the information on the Internet on the topic ‚Äúcybernetic eyes‚Äù, ‚Äúbionic eyes, then you will see that the young, emerging industry and what inventions we will use very soon, is not entirely clear.  Different scientists, different capabilities, technologies, and finally, a different vision of implementation and use.  Here I have stated only one option out of a thousand.  And you have the opportunity to reflect on this topic. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/213799/">https://habr.com/ru/post/213799/</a></p>
