In accordance with their wishes, IIDF is investing 0.5 billion rubles in the development of start-ups in this area.  FRIA will create the so-called ‚Äúbig data‚Äù laboratory, which will be engaged in the technological development of start-ups: help in hiring the right employees, purchasing and setting up equipment, and developing software products. <br><br>  In the next few years, the fund is ready to invest in start-up projects up to 2 million rubles in exchange for a share of 7%.  The maximum amount that FRIA can invest in one project with a proven business model is 324 million rubles in exchange for a share of up to 50% of the company, says the representative of the IIDF Sergey Skripnikov.  According to him, now the fund has already found four applied tasks that strategic investors want to solve.  IIDF plans to invest in a few dozen startups. <br><br>  Anatoly Orlov, who has worked at <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AF%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581">Yandex for</a> 10 years and <a href="https://roem.ru/24-09-2015/207978/anatolix">left the</a> company in September, will lead the laboratory of big data in the IIDF.  After his dismissal from the largest Russian Internet company, he stated that he was looking for a ‚Äúproject for the second half of his life,‚Äù and he was not interested in just working for money. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Since 2013, the IIDF has remained the most active investment fund in Russia.  According to the Dow Jones report, IIDF ranked first in Europe in terms of the number of transactions in the first quarter of 2014.  As of April 4, 2015, the fund financed 150 projects, including 104 transactions in 2014.  IIDF plans to invest 6 billion rubles in 400 companies until 2017. <br><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBS_Group">IBS</a> IT integrator recently opened its division for working with ‚Äúbig data‚Äù Datalab.  A company representative, Sergey Matsotsky, believes that there are enough startups in the big data segment on the Russian market. <br><br>  The head of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/yandex/blog/245393/">Yandex Data Factory</a> project office, Alexander Khaitin, agrees with this.  In December 2014, the Russian Internet company Yandex launched a new direction for working with ‚Äúbig data‚Äù - Yandex Data Factory.  YDF provides services to companies that work with ‚Äúbig data‚Äù: for example, sensor readings, audio and video recordings, order information, and so on. <br><br>  The threshold for entry into the big data analytics industry is small: computing power is now inexpensive and infrastructure can be rented.  Product development can cost several hundred thousand dollars, and the main asset of such companies are engineers and mathematicians, and they are in the Russian market, Matsotsky argues. <br><br>  The big data market has focused on consumer behavior: advertising and trading on the Internet, as well as telematics (for example, the study of driver behavior for insurance companies).  Now, Internet giants are best at analyzing big data (Matsotsky calls Yandex, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google">Google</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook">Facebook</a> as an example).  The banking sector and the telecommunications industry are experimenting with big data, but they have not yet learned how to commercialize the result, he believes. <br><br>  The demand and supply in the big data analytics segment are not structured: customers do not always know exactly what they want to buy, and suppliers can not always articulate what they are selling, says Haitin.  According to YDF‚Äôs experience, the fastest ‚Äúbig data‚Äù is monetized in the banking sector, retail and telecommunications. <br><br>  Last week <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D1%258B%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB-%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">, VimpelCom</a> (Beeline brand) and Yandex launched strategic cooperation in the field of Big Data, Roem.ru reported.  The Yandex Data Factory department will develop services for predicting the outflow of Beeline customers, to increase the work of sales specialists in call centers and to optimize advertising costs. <br><br>  When developing Yandex services, MatrixNet uses machine learning technology, Crypt and Look-alike advertising technologies, and Yandex SpeechKit speech technologies. <br><br>  There are thousands of big data analytics projects in the US, and there are dozens of them in Russia, says the director of the American company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivotal_Software">Pivotal</a> (big data analytics) in Russia and the CIS, Sergei Zolotaryov.  He agrees that the Russian business does not fully appreciate the economic benefits of big data analytics and the domestic big data analytics market lags behind the leading countries by 3-4 years. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296660/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296660/</a></p>
