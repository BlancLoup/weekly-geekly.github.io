  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Question to IT departments: how would you like to see a service for BYOD?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Hello habrazhiteli!</b>  <b>I have a question for you for a couple of minutes.</b>  <b>The answer depends on what kind of tool for managing employees' smartphones you receive and what will be included in it.</b> <br><br>  There is such a tendency as BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) - this is when an employee brings his smartphone or tablet to the company and says that he wants to make work calls from him, read corporate mail and put corporate software on him.  Simply put, he wants to work with this device in the company's ecosystem. <br><br>  <b>For example, on new Blackberry OS BB10, it looks like this</b> : you swipe up and you can choose a corporate or personal area.  In the corporate area, you can find work mail, work logins on websites, work applications and certificates, work documents, and personal mail with your personal mail and personal desktop.  At the same time, for example, when leaving the company, you know that the corporate part is the property of the corporation and will be deleted first and then overwritten to a new one in a new place, and the personal part remains yours and cannot be affected in any way.

      It is clear that to implement the BYOD approach for all smartphones, you need an IT solution and there are already such solutions.  We are considering the possibility of introducing a platform that will make the management of employee devices very simple - through a mobile cloud service.  And I have questions about what exactly you would like to see in this service. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  We will immediately determine that BYOD is not a technology or a turnkey solution, it is a market trend, reflecting the approach of a company to the devices of its employees.  This requires a response from IT directors.  The device has already become part of the life of a modern person and he wants to use this particular device at work.  From the point of view of accepting this trend, Russian CIOs are somewhere in the middle - they perceive it more positively than their colleagues in the developed countries of Western Europe, but less positively than representatives of American or Asian companies.  For our compatriots, the level of trust to a partner who provides this or that service is very important, especially if it is related to employee devices. <br><br>  Just a couple of years ago, while it was a question of simple phones, BYOD questions were heard first of all in the USA.  You've probably heard about the integration of BlackBerry into workflows, the ability to sign documents directly on the phone and access your office computer directly from your smartphone under a regular login.  In Europe and Russia, BYOD was not immediately recognized: if you need to provide corporate communications, it is easier to distribute simple phones to employees, if you need to provide mail, it depends on the IT department: either it doesn‚Äôt care where or how an employee gets access, or there is a strict ban on using devices outside the office. <br><br>  The real difficulties began when tablets and high-end smartphones became widespread.  Two trends came together here: firstly, by this time there were already many mobile employees who needed an office just for the sake of mail and a couple of special software, and, secondly, even inside the office it was often much faster and more convenient to work with a tablet.  And with these things you can go to customers and show presentations - that is, without corporate software they can not do. <br><br><h4>  Real situation </h4><br>  In the United States, this area is very well developed: managers usually understand that BYOD improves work efficiency and may even provide a monetary quota for buying a basic smartphone for employees.  In some European countries (for example, in France), on the contrary, there are bans on using their devices for working purposes on security policies.  In India, BYOD received its own profile - there is a very highly developed system virtualization, incl.  for access from any device, and smartphones with tablets turned out to be an excellent choice for this. <br><br>  This year, BYOD is at the peak of interest with CIOs and security directors in all developed and developing countries.  Worldwide, 89% of IT departments support BYOD in one form or another. <br><br>  Let's look at the most paranoid situation: the work is simply forbidden to use their devices (less often they are left at the entrance to the office), or you have access to the network, but there is no support.  Absolutely you can not put corporate applications, there is no access to the company's cloud services.  At the same time, the security service of the company generally considers the employees' satellites as such a huge gap in protection, and the IT department has to keep all the software on the desktops and not really get carried away with virtualization.  I want to believe that we have already passed this stage of development. <br><br><h4>  What can BYOD support give to the company? </h4><br>  BYOD can not be stopped, but they can learn to manage.  There are various solutions for this that can be implemented as part of your company's ‚Äúcorporate mobility‚Äù strategy, as we did, for example.  I will list the pros and cons of balanced work with BYOD in the company. <br><br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br><ul><li>  The smart integration of smartphones into the company's ecosystem helps protect corporate data.  If smartphones are used "as is", then there is a great chance of leakage of data due to negligence, due to industrial espionage and because of the actions of viruses (often non-directional actions). </li><li>  Most of the solutions have convenient profiling: you can roll out corporate work applications, easily assign rights, and so on.  All this is done from a single interface. </li><li>  Separation of personal data and corporate: roughly speaking, a person is sure that the security service monitors work mail, but does not see personal one. </li><li>  Good device management of a large number of users in different places (relevant for companies with hundreds of employees). </li><li>  There are solutions with access to the desktop desktop from a smartphone, and there is the possibility of remote technical support. </li><li>  In most cases, you can delete all corporate data when an employee leaves (and keep personal). </li></ul><br><br>  Total: employees bring their devices and work for them.  It is fast, convenient, safe for them and economical for the company. <br><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br><ul><li>  Not always convenient customization of smartphones for the user (for example, some solutions will not allow to put a set of beautiful skins or any other whistles), sometimes - restrictions on available applications. </li><li>  We need a person who is responsible for all this in the company. </li><li>  The company should have an understanding of what Enterprise Mobility is in general and how the company lives with it. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Platform </h4><br>  Now we are considering the possibility of implementing a solution that makes it easy and simple to deploy a mobile device management system through a simple and clear web interface.  Opportunities for such systems are many, but it is important for us to understand what interests you - potential users of such platforms. <br><br>  To make it clearer which classes of problems can be solved, I will tell you what is most in demand in developed markets.  Below are examples of classes of tasks that may be required from the corporate mobile device management platform. <br><ul><li>  The system can do remote configuration (roll profiles on devices); </li><li>  Bring updates and patches to devices; </li><li>  Make backups of corporate data; </li><li>  Giving access to security personnel to corporate accounts; </li><li>  Organize protection against malicious programs; </li><li>  Synchronize data; </li><li>  Provide reading of documents in various formats (transcoding at the platform level); </li><li>  Hosting user files; </li><li>  To make managed "markets" of internal corporate applications; </li><li>  Solve various software development tasks for this ecosystem. </li><li>  Allow encryption </li><li>  Make notifications to employees, for example, at the level of push messages about meetings. </li><li>  Implement easy access to helpdesk and other services; </li><li>  Determine the location of the employee. </li><li>  Activate and deactivate devices in the system, make a remote lock. </li><li>  Have the ability to optimize performance, memory and battery for specific devices. </li><li>  Allow various access rights and provide unambiguous user authentication; </li><li>  Give access to corporate VPN. </li></ul><br><br>  As a result, the system at the user level looks like this: he calls the IT department and says: ‚ÄúI want to read mail here and enter CRM,‚Äù even if it is in another country.  After 5 minutes (no more), he should be able to work with mail and corporate applications.  At the same time, those IT services that understand that they cannot impose anything on the user look most healthy for us ‚Äî and if the system is too complex, obviously, it will not use it. <br><br><h4>  Questions to you </h4><br><ul><li>  <b>Do your employees already use their devices for working with corporate mail and internal information?</b>  Is this relevant to them? </li><li>  <b>What problems arise when using personal devices of employees in the company?</b> </li><li>  Do you know about the existence of mobile device management systems?  Have they ever been used? </li><li>  <b>What specific functions do you, as representatives of IT departments, critically need today</b> (from the above in 4 categories or others) and which ones will be needed in the future? </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/171795/">https://habr.com/ru/post/171795/</a></p>
