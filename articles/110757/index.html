Today, tenders are aggregated on erumpo from more than 65 sites on the Russian Internet, including the most popular public sites (zakupki.gov.ru, roseltorg, sberbank-ast and many others) and commercial (telecom sector, banks, industry). <br><br>  You can search for tenders and purchases on erumpo: by categories (now ~ 80), attached documents, contract price, publication date, etc. Also, the RSS feeds functionality has been implemented according to search criteria.  Therefore, it is not necessary to constantly be on the site to get new information, you set up RSS and all new tenders and purchases come to the necessary search queries yourself ... <br><br>  To gain access, you simply need to register your company and add one or more standard projects that you are ready to undertake.  Under the standard project on erumpo is understood the "area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity", which deals with the company.  And this may be, for example, the sale of any products, their production or, for example, the provision of services, both temporary (assistance in the implementation of IT systems) and permanent (subsequent support).

      Access to tenders and orders, and participation in them for all IT suppliers on erumpo will always be free - this is the company's policy.  In the very near future, erumpo plans to launch a functional for self-publishing tenders and orders directly by customers. <br><br><h4>  More about the project </h4><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  What for? </h5><br><br>  The problems that the service should help solve are two: <br><ul><li>  The supplier‚Äôs company has a desire to find a customer in order to do some work for it related to IT or high technology, or simply a desire to sell some hardware or software. </li><li>  The customer‚Äôs company has a desire to do some kind of work related to IT or high technology, by external contractors, or simply to buy some piece of hardware or software to perform its IT functions. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  What tools already exist to solve formulated problems? </h5><br><br>  <b>Different forums</b> Because of their inconvenience, they cover a very narrow spectrum, both of suppliers and customers, because of all the services needed for a mutual search, only one is given - a text-to-text communication tool. <br><br>  <b>Search Engines</b> Covers a very narrow range of providers: the ‚Äútip‚Äù or those who are good at promoting and unwinding.  If they cover customers, they absolutely do not cover their current needs and do not allow answering the question: ‚Äúwhat exactly does a particular customer need at the moment?‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Paid tender sites</b> Aggregate mainly information on tenders and purchases from free state and commercial sites and sell it to suppliers for money.  Because of its wide focus, since it covers all niches at once, each such site is similar to a dump.  Therefore, there are not many suppliers willing to pay for such information.  And for customers, such sites do have a dubious benefit, since: firstly, they cover few suppliers in each of the areas and, secondly, they do not provide additional tools besides the publication of tenders and procurement, which can be placed on your own website <br><br>  <b>Platforms for conducting electronic auctions</b> Recently, a large number of such sites began to multiply, and suppliers have to lose a lot of time to monitor each such platform.  Therefore, such sites a priori can not provide coverage to a large number of suppliers, in view of what they resemble advanced forums with advanced tools for mutual search. <br><br><h5>  What distinguishes erumpo from all existing tools today? </h5><br><br>  <b>The erumpo</b> niche is focused only on IT and high technologies, which makes it possible to make mutual search services convenient for customers and suppliers in the IT and high-tech niche. <br><br>  <b>Aggregation of tenders and purchases from other sites</b> besides own tenders and purchases on erumpo are aggregated tenders and purchases from most of the available sites, including sites for electronic auctions, and also categorizes selected tenders and orders, which reduces the presence of "garbage" for suppliers working in the selected niche <br><br>  <b>Absolute free of charge for suppliers</b> because only when a supplier publishes free information about himself and can search for clients for his services and products absolutely free, can one cover the whole range of suppliers and provide customers with a real opportunity to choose and save when placing their orders and tenders ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110757/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110757/</a></p>
