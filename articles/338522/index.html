Although in reality, waiting for photos and videos from our mobile studio.  So, what happened on June 5-6 in Skolkovo? <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/338522/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e86/809/972/e8680997261de264f25ec1d37f6a4a83.png"></a> <br>  <i><font color="#999999">Life is a boring thing, and every opportunity must be used to make people smile (E. Kusturica)</font></i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  IT shny Babylon </h2><br>  Theoretically, we assumed that the summer RHS ++ would be different from the autumn HighLoad ++, but we were completely mistaken with the vector of our guesses.  It seemed that the festival of Internet technologies would be more light, with fewer hardcore reports and more participants who had little to do with IT.  Everything turned out to be exactly the opposite - RHS ++ turned out to be a festival of very serious, hardcore technologies.  But he was distinguished from HighLoad by people - they were much more involved, contact and ready for dialogue.  Hayload is more introverted, and it is really noticeable.  There were 1,800 participants, 14 parallel streams, 23 mitaps, 16 company stands. <br><br>  The organizers tried to form communications within the festival: for example, channels were organized in Slack and Telegram.  They were actively discussing, correspondence was taking place, each participant could ask, ask, leave an important announcement, clarify some details.  Moreover, the channels are still alive and active - they ask questions, talk, arrange mini-riots and flash mobs.  In general, these are communications that I don‚Äôt want to disconnect even after three months.

      The stands of the companies were a little different - the summer and the public made their adjustments.  So, you could enjoy cool graffiti at the Avito stand, poke around with Vscale's yeti, treat yourself to chocolate chip ice cream and drink cool lemonade. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d11/fbc/270/d11fbc270f37f1db4b2fefacfa0c54c0.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Complex, bright stand Avito - graffiti and company address on Habr√©</font></i> <i><font color="#999999"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b18/f7d/8c8/b18f7d8c851e45eac31ebedf1c0ea450.png"><br></font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">The shaman made gifts and prizes</font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bc1/730/cc2/bc1730cc2f7d8b2af65e55839605a44a.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">The Yeti was very popular.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">As you can see, someone even managed to drink a friendly creature</font></i> <br><br>  Habr also did not stand aside - both days we had a difficult exam, in which we gave to solve problems collected in advance from different companies.  Some volunteers stood at the booth for several hours and pushed sheet by leaf with pens - excitement reigned around us.  And it's no accident - except for cool stickers and marathon stickers, we distributed invites.  Strictly one in hand!  And at the end of the second day we had beer on our stand.

We no, no, yes, and came up to look through the next edition.  They were all beautiful. <br><br>  And in the midst of this Babylon a spontaneous orchestra with beautiful invigorating melodies suddenly struck ‚Äî only Kusturica could do that.  Believe it or not, but it was this event that set the defiant tone and energetic pace of the whole event.  It was one hundred percent hit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3be/2e2/3e8/3be2e23e88517710ebb56e6988b67f9b.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">The mood on RHS ++ was wonderful: there was a warm rain-fog outside the window, in Skolkovo it was fun, clever, creative</font></i> <br><br>  But the director's part did not end there either - a stunning shaman walked along Skolkovo both days, famously dancing with pretty participants under the still unfinished ‚ÄúMushrooms‚Äù ‚ÄúIce is melting between us‚Äù.  Still this shaman would have nasamanil a stable Internet connection, he would not have a price.

The content of RHS ++ was so intense that our two text translators continuously cursed and were torn between the sections they wanted to go to.  Any audience could find reports to your taste or participate in numerous events within RIT ++. <br><br><h3>  Sections with reports </h3><br>  The entire RIT ++ was divided into several thematic conferences.  Moreover, the speeches of all the speakers of the sections were deeply thematic.  What always pleases at the festivals of Oleg Bunin is the time of the report - in one hour you can catch up and perfectly expand the topic and answer the questions.  The lack of technical overlays with presentations and microphones turns each section into a continuous stream of selected and necessary information. <br><br><ul><li>  <i>Whaile Rider</i> is a conference on management and entrepreneurship.  The reports of this stream reflected all areas of company management, from strategic issues to a detailed analysis of the preparation of infographics (absolutely terrific report) and the search for the secrets of the effectiveness of technical support work. <br></li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f9/7b7/ce4/2f97b7ce46020e844e5e560728a107d1.png">  <i><font color="#999999">Some reports lacked space.</font></i> <br><br><ul><li>  <i>Aletheia Business</i> is a conference on the application of psychology in management and business.  In short, we learned better to understand ourselves and people, talked about career, loyalty, and why Russians are not smiling.  In general, during RIT ++ there were many discussions of the HR aspects of the IT sphere and the issues of psychology.  The headliners of this discussion were Peter Ludwig with his report ‚ÄúThe End of Procrastination‚Äù and Maxim Dorofeev with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsaving fuel and stunning slides.  These guys literally gathered the hall, more precisely, the largest hall - the congress hall. <br></li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b2e/d73/bbb/b2ed73bbb768dcf9ae52b68866fa42da.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Peter Ludwig tried to conquer the invincible.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Or not?</font></i> <br><br><ul><li>  <i>Web-scale IT Conference</i> - a conference at the junction of enterprise and web-cultures.  This, at first glance, vague conference on topics, gathered in itself non-standard discussions: state + business, microservices, omni-channel, etc.  From what we heard in this stream, we especially liked the report of Alexander Taratorin from Raiffeisenbank on real DevOps in Enterprise - what struck me most was the structured and transparent way in which it was done in the bank.  It would seem that there is an inert functional organizational structure, and how modern everything is solved. <br></li><li>  <i>Frontend Conf</i> - conference frontend developers.  The frontend is frontend - they were literally talking about everything. <br></li><li>  <i>App's Conf</i> - a conference on the development of mobile applications already occupied two halls.  Interface issues, application logic, testing and design were discussed by representatives of companies that know a lot about mobile development like no one: Avito, Lamoda, 2GIS, Mail.ru Group, Odnoklassniki, Yandex, Sberbank-Technologies, etc. <br></li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/597/52e/95d/59752e95d7f8e06b9e63e15757c31f06.png"><br><br><ul><li>  <i>Root Conf</i> - conference on operation and DevOps.  Everything is expected: a lot about DevOps, a little about Docker, monitoring and other administrative issues. <br></li><li>  <i>High Load Junio</i> r is a training conference for developers of high-load systems.  This is not a collection of "light" reports, as someone might have thought, but deep training reports for beginners, but already intersecting the topic of juniors.  Some reports were more hardcore than in the autumn Highload.  But the main thing - it is clear and understandable instructions that can be taken and transferred to their daily work.  By the way, this time there was a lot about DDoS attacks and many were familiar - about databases.  The tone for the entire High Load Junior was set by the courageous and clever MySQL report from the feminine and creative Sveta Smirnova and Nastya Raspopina from Percona.  Well, the report of the stream, which deserves the grand prix in the modest opinion of our translators, was the report of Sergey Sporyshev from the company ITSumma - he told the full story of the creation of Project 1917.  We can‚Äôt imagine why this exciting story is still not in the blog of the guys on Habr√©! <br></li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7f9/9f3/67f/7f99f367f1c5cbf31bb4b942c54a952d.png">  <i><font color="#999999">Hayload girls Percona Light and Nastya</font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/09d/3fe/23f/09d3fe23f77aff636824a34182fa5beb.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">The guys from ITSumma even had to work at the conference.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Still, when they have such projects!</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Julia strictly followed the process</font></i> <br><br><ul><li>  Backend Conf ‚Äî backend developers conference.  The backend is a backend - cool profile discussions. <br></li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8d5/092/402/8d5092402ee02b10828dffd1d2376215.png"><br><br><h3>  Mitapy </h3><br>  Another form of work of experts at RIT ++ is numerous meetings.  In small and large halls, people gathered who discussed issues in a sharp debating form.  However, the form was pre-guaranteed content.  Here are just a few topics that we managed to drop in for a few minutes and warm our ears: <br><br><ul><li>  intellectual asset management <br></li><li>  Devops <br></li><li>  relocation to Europe <br></li><li>  legal issues <br></li><li>  creating a framework from scratch <br></li><li>  Tarantool <br></li><li>  Tdd <br></li><li>  performance and so on. <br></li></ul><br>  Judging by the discussions, of particular interest to the participants was a mitap, or rather, a master class on microservices and Kubernetes.  We also noticed that spontaneous mitapas and master classes were created in Skolkovo's free mini-negotiation rooms - another good tradition of Oleg Bunin's conferences. <br><blockquote>  <i>Yes, everything was fine :) The main thing is that the conference does not deteriorate, there are still many opportunities to listen to the most very different specialists, expand your horizons and deepen your knowledge.</i>  <i>It was and remains the most important.</i>  <i>Everything else is trivial.</i>  <i>However, I like the fact that you always change something and add.</i>  <i>In itself, this benefit may not bring, but there is a sense of dynamics and the desire to develop.</i>  <i>It is encouraging.</i> </blockquote><br><h3>  Highlighted events </h3><br>  In the framework of RIT ++, separate streams ‚Äúunder the wing‚Äù of companies were held - a series of reports combined into one conference.  This year it was: <br><br><ul><li>  Development and machine learning from SuperJob, Tarantool and Digital Security <br></li><li>  Microservices from Avito <br></li><li>  PGDAY'17 Russia Day - a lot of things about databases and PostgreSQL in particular. <br></li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/69f/619/911/69f619911165420c9dd4d6b3619fb0a8.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">PostgreSQL - the birthplace of elephants</font></i> <br><br>  These sections allow you to communicate within a narrow interest group and pay more attention to practical issues.  And of course, this is an opportunity for companies to demonstrate their experience, and for participants - their own.  Sometimes they find each other. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/403/fc8/e64/403fc8e64784e74842e303b087bebba2.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Participants continue to solve problems at Habr's stand</font></i> <br><br>  In addition to official events from the organizers, the communication took place continuously - on the sidelines, canteens, on sofas around the perimeter of Skolkovo, on coffee breaks and company stands.  For the sake of interest, we approached small groups, listened - all conversations concerned experience, best practices, and work.  Actually, similar to such festivals are good - you return to work with ideas, and sometimes with ready-made solutions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/81d/552/a58/81d552a588cbf046b797c498c281ca9b.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Habr's stickers scattered in the blink of an eye</font></i> <br><br><h3>  The UFO flew in and left an inscription there. </h3><br>  Habr has long found his corner in Skolkovo, and very immodest - still, apart from the stand, we need to place a whole studio where we interviewed the most interesting, bright, recognizable speakers.  This year we went to the experiment and asked some professionals to interview other professionals.  Our idea was perfect - the conversations were easily stuck, these were whole discussions beyond the question-answer format. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/83b/826/3ad/83b8263adb4550efcb3510b859b27957.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">The cunning web of our studio lured the best speakers</font></i> <i><font color="#999999"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/655/1cc/d01/6551ccd01be2dd491233ad8e9364c8c6.jpg"><br></font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">They basked in the <s>glory of the</s> spotlights</font></i> <br><br>  We filmed more than 10 hours of video and that was just when solid videos came out.

Some were even lost. <br><br>  Habrahabr traditionally did not confine himself to a studio, but held a round table on HR and technological evangelism with the participation of evangelist Alexander Belotserkovsky from Microsoft, devrel Avito Mikhail Klyuev, Alexander Serbul from 1C-Beatrix and Olga Bely from My Circle.  Feels like listeners and presenter, one hour of the round table flew like 10 minutes.  It was hot in places! <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VfymNkxgY5s" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  It was so interesting with the speakers that Marika was forced to interrupt IT conversations with the help of harsh signs: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5e3/d16/abb/5e3d16abb8aaf7c0316b232d8f986a07.jpg"><br><br>  In parallel, our reporters lead text online on both days of the conference, twisting 27,000 steps a day across Skolkovo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ddd/ca9/d2f/dddca9d2ff2285ea385405a34fbc94ea.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">A rare photo - online from the inside.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">And at the same time, the laptop of one of the Habr moderators.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Burning fan of three browsers at once!</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">(actually, Firefox was also there)</font></i> <i><font color="#999999"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a01/166/a1b/a01166a1b5c447d471fb1abcf70d2370.jpg"><br></font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">UFOs sometimes need maintenance</font></i> <br><br><h2>  Columbia can't imagine what hardcore was </h2><br>  However, hardcore was not limited to sessions of conferences and reports.  On the first day in the tent, we celebrated Habr's birthday and poured fine beers for everyone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/33c/22a/68d/33c22a68daeb76f5bba164ca8e7a213f.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Remember the Black Lord?</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">He was there</font></i> <i><font color="#999999"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/147/98f/83b/14798f83b3043391b63df0d7dcb2f8f3.png"><br></font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Let's see rock at this Moscow School of Management SKOLKOVO!</font></i> <br><br>  In the meantime, everyone sipped habrapivo, teams consisting of IT people played from the scene.  Wet and warm weather has a little ruined the participants, and they leisurely talked in the courtyard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/930/bb3/8e6/930bb38e6898d80c9ee37d9ffe5f4d45.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">There was no rain, there was a pleasant fog.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Communicated in a warm atmosphere in every sense</font></i> <i><font color="#999999"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/682/c18/889/682c18889c931bb6ba33f50231b8e984.png"><br></font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Board games have captivated many</font></i> <br><br>  At the same time, almost until late at night, on the territory of Skolkovo, there was a hot competition in cybersport and unhurried board game tournaments.  Words do not convey the degree of excitement and emotional tension from the site.  All literally burned out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ff1/7e9/55e/ff17e955ee69df47f82a6ab24e97fd9f.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">No photo will convey the atmosphere of competition in eSports.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">It was a glow</font></i> <br><br>  Well, nothing, the morning special charge fixed it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/025/af4/22c/025af422c13b82eae065e42c36d3b9d3.png"><br><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Kung Fu Masters - Not Born</font></i> <i><font color="#999999"><br></font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Kung Fu Masters - Become</font></i> <i><font color="#999999"><br></font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Dangers - do not get scared</font></i> <i><font color="#999999"><br></font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Receptions are accurate - everything will come true ...</font></i> <br><br><h2>  We will Rock You </h2><br>  And while you are reading this post, the preparation for HighLoad ++ is going on with might and main - the autumn is here, it's time to raise the issues of high-loaded projects.
