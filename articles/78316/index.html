  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Anti-marketing Raiffeisenbank</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the last year, advertising of banks has become particularly active.  But apparently, the old truth about the fact that in addition to finding new customers it would be good not to offend the old and remains a theory. <br><br>  I have been working with Raiffeisen since 2002 (at that time it was Impexbank), and all these years I have been pleased with everything.  Of course, there were unpleasant trifles, such as client-bank only for IE, the rates are far from the lowest in the market.  But for me the most important thing in the bank is reliability and predictability.  And this was not to take away - I came, got honestly earned and left.  Do not hesitate to recommend them to friends. <br><br>  I‚Äôm SP, I communicate with the bank through an electronic office, and I come to ‚Äúmy‚Äù branch 1-2 times a month.  The offices were periodically closed, and I was transferred to others.  All this time, the process went smoothly and unnoticed.  But for the last time I had to face a striking example of anti-marketing.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Having come to the new branch for the first time, in order to remove honestly earned money as usual, I was intercepted by one of the managers.  She said that while moving my lawyers looked at my ‚Äúcase‚Äù and found several errors.  They dated around the year 2004.  I was required to bring several documents.  Up to this point, everything went fine. <br><br>  But apparently they decided to additionally ‚Äúmotivate‚Äù me and said that until the moment I brought these documents, they would not give me the money for the check.  And it happened <i>without any prior warning</i> .  It is clear to explain why the lack of documents from 2004 did not prevent them from working with me for the last few years in another office to me so clearly and could not. <br><br>  For the sake of interest, I talked with a friend working in a bank.  Her such behavior of the bank was very surprised - according to her, it is <i>illegal</i> .  Also, in Raiffeisen, they <i>could not explain</i> to me on the basis of which Regulation they refused to give me money.  If it is simpler, they have greatly complicated my life out of the blue.  Judging by what I heard - I am not alone. <br><br>  What are the conclusions?  It's simple.  Ordering documents is good and good.  But to <b>block the work of clients, even with the best of intentions, is bad</b> .  By the way, they contact me at least once a week through the ‚Äúclient-bank‚Äù.  I do not think that it is impossible to add the ability to send messages to the client there.  Messages about technical changes "client-bank" regularly gives me at each entry. <br><br>  Everyone will make a conclusion for himself.  And I will solve the problem, in parallel, looking for an alternative to Raiffeisen that disappointed me.  And in accordance with the precepts of marketing luminaries, I will tell about my dissatisfaction with others ;-). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78316/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78316/</a></p>
