  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What kind of Internet startup students can come up with in one hour?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last Saturday, November 22, in the Moscow State <br>  The university hosted the next intercollegiate business game from the Flipchat series, which is held by the <a href="http://www.hse-inc.ru/">Business Incubator of the Higher School of Economics</a> .  <a href="http://www.egenius.ru/">The Egenius.ru project</a> could not but take part in such an interesting event, and we were very lucky, because  The organizers not only kindly invited us to the jury, but also made it possible to propose a theme for the game.  What we did with great pleasure. <br>  <b>This is followed by a description of the conditions of the game, the task and 13 options for solving it, including projects of petting networks, remote desktops and fitness trainers online</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the beginning I will tell about what the event was. <br>  By the appointed time, namely, by 5.30 pm, 13 student teams gathered in one of the lecture halls of the 2nd Humanitarian Corps, which needed, without using laptops and the Internet, to solve a given problem.  The results of the brainstorming session should have been reflected on the A1 format paperman in the form of a visual plan, diagram or image of the decision.  And on page A4 to make a brief summary of the project, including its name, competitive advantages, financial calculations and everything that has time for the time remaining from thinking about the idea and its graphical representation on the drawing paper. <br>  Actually, the task was as follows: <br>  Come up with a new Internet project (service, portal, social network, etc.) that would be either completely innovative or greatly improved. <br>  version of the existing resource.  The project must be real, viable and financially attractive. <br>  Further, the teams were asked to submit the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe jury in 3 minutes (which included not only AVK Media representatives, but also teachers from the Department of Economic Theory and Financial Management of FSU MSU). <br>  After 3 minutes, the speaker (or speakers) was resolutely interrupted, and a queue of questions came from the jury (in unlimited quantities) and <br>  questions from the audience (in a limited number - strictly 3 pieces). <br>  So, what actually suggested the command: <ol><li>  PTZ offered an "Auction Insurance Risk" auction for <br>  insurers and car owners.  Owners eager to insure the means <br>  movement, selects only a set of desired options and cost, and insurers offer who and what at what price. </li><li>  MSU_CMC proposed the project "Children in the frame."  Total surveillance of children in schools using video cameras, the image from which is transmitted to the portal, where parents have access to pay for the service.  There were many comments about what it would not be allowed to do in public schools, about the safety of children (what if the site was hacked by terrorists or they would be watched by maniacs), that children have the right to a notorious privacy. <br>  But today, when we discussed this idea with colleagues, it turned out that something like this already exists and is being introduced in schools.  So that. </li><li>  Glamour37 proposed the project "Smart Surf".  It implies the analysis of your preferences on the Internet and on the basis of the content of the websites you visit, drawing up recommendations on new resources.  Perhaps the guys had in mind a new word in the search engines, but it seemed to us that more <br>  looks like Imhonet.ru (which, in addition to books and films, also began <br>  make recommendations regarding sites) </li><li>  SPCS, Jazz Team and Peon (I list all in one paragraph, because <br>  the idea put forward essentially the same) proposed a project of a remote desktop (‚ÄúRemote Opportunities‚Äù, ‚ÄúvDesk‚Äù and ‚ÄúFor me‚Äù, respectively). <br>  The first focused on increasing the computational capabilities of low-power laptops, the second in the storage of music and video files, and still others are all very beautifully depicted in Whatman paper.  But the trouble is, none of them offered a solution to the problem over which large corporations are fighting. <br>  However, this is not a drawback.  Only the designation of the fact that the idea is ‚Äúin the air‚Äù, and the guys know and understand the trends of Internet technologies. </li><li>  New Strategists proposed the Rare Things project.  An online store selling primarily unusual souvenirs from faraway countries. <br>  It is planned to deliver souvenirs with the help of travel agents.  By itself, the project is interesting, but the logistics are already very cumbersome, moreover, how it all differs from eBay is not very clear. </li><li>  E8 offered the project "Personal Fitness Trainer".  Online consultation of trainers, the opportunity to show them their records <br>  workouts, get advice nutritionists and other necessary <br>  specialists.  The general opinion of the hall was that training is dangerous. <br>  carry out under unstable Internet surveillance, but no one thought about the possibility of video chatting. </li><li>  The Business Team proposed the project ‚ÄúPatid.ru‚Äù, where brilliant ideas find their investors. Moreover, the website is not only a platform for finding money and ideas, but also has the capabilities of a patent office.  It is a pity that there are a lot of such sites, patent offices and other collections of ideas on the Internet. </li><li>  IO &amp; CO and Android offered variations on the topic of social networks for pets (Zoosearch.ru and Zverie.ru, respectively).  At the first, the social scheme was similar in functionality to Vkontakte, while in the second it was similar to My Circle.  Won first </li><li>  Kavamaris offered the project "Weak?".  The crossing of youtube and the well-known competition in the framework of the program "Itself is the director."  I posted a video of my skills and wait, if someone after a week repeats and puts the results on the video - you lost.  If not - won.  The guys hope that their project will be able to attract major manufacturers who will initiate to pay for contests with their products.  Hmm ... will it? </li><li>  Alpha Consulting offered the project "Fundays", where the traveler <br>  selects a place on the virtual globe, from the set of opened <br>  forms a tour, pays for it in advance and gets a certain card from which it then comfortably travels along the chosen route. <br>  But ... iGlobe and a large base of tours - does it have a right to live? </li></ol>  The winners were Auction Insurance Risks (PTZ), Zoosearch (IO &amp; CO) - they passed to the final, which will be held in March-April 2009.  And the SPCS team won the Audience Award for the breadth of technical thought. <br>  From remarks to all participants - FINANCE!  MONETIZATION!  You can not spend on advertising a local resource of 600 K bucks a year.  One should not think that large-scale banners will be placed on a highly specialized resource.  You can‚Äôt think that banners are the only thing <br>  means of advertising on the Internet. <br><br>  And the rest, a huge respect to young people who are ready to devote 5 hours on Saturday evening to solving business problems and debriefing colleagues.  And able to form at least an hour, perhaps ideas that have long been spinning in my head.  Not to mention the ability to generate anything in such a short time. <br><br><habracut></habracut></div>
