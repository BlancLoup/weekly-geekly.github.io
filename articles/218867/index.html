The following paragraph appeared in it: <br><blockquote>  Sexual content.  Applications that advertise or contain pornographic materials, including images, titles and descriptions of an erotic nature, are prohibited.  Google has a zero-tolerance policy on child pornography.  If we find materials containing the image of minors in a sexual context, we will inform the appropriate law enforcement agencies and remove the accounts of all users who participated in their distribution. </blockquote><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The change seems quite logical against the background of the overlap of icons with too frank content.  The fact that such an innovation has appeared only now causes bewilderment.  It seems that the interest of regulators and their ‚Äúinsistent recommendations‚Äù, which we recalled in our past reviews, are doing their job.  We strongly recommend that you review the above link for changes - we are sure that they will follow in the very near future. <br><br>  Such steps on the part of one of the leading mobile stores can lead to a decrease in loyalty, especially since an authoritative media has noticed an activity on the topic ‚Äú <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/06/the-fallacy-of-android-first/">Why the Android first strategy is meaningless</a> .‚Äù

    <br><h4>  Amazon: another attempt </h4><br>  In the light of not so pleasant events around the Google Play platform, Amazon‚Äôs activity in the quest to become the ‚Äúthird platform‚Äù after the Apple App Store and Google‚Äôs mobile market is of interest.  The latest <a href="http://www.pocketgamer.biz/job-news/58723/as-designers-clint-hocking-and-kim-swift-join-up-amazon-game-studios-sneak-peaks-8-new-games/">news</a> from the Amazon camp shows that the company intends to develop not only as a platform for third-party developers.  In the internal development studio is becoming more ‚Äústar‚Äù beginners.  So, recently Clint Hawking, who worked at Ubisoft, LucasArts and Valve, moved to Amazon Game Studios. <br><br>  At one time, rumors were actively discussed that Facebook is building its relationship with Zynga on special conditions.  They did not find official confirmation, as well as the moment of breaking off these relations.  The model of cooperation among such promising platforms as LINE and Kakao Talk is more clearly expressed (instant messengers are by default). <br><br>  In our opinion, active lobbying of interests of own development can push away external developers, for whose attention Amazon has been actively fighting for the last year. <br><br><br><h4>  Bots are getting bolder </h4><br>  Putting the application to the TOPs at any cost ‚Äî better cheaply, of course ‚Äî remains one of the most popular methods of promoting in the mobile market.  Before the passion around the methods by which the Flappy bird ‚Äúblew up‚Äù the mobile stor, did not have time to lie down, they again turned to new methods of rating cheating. <br><br>  This time, the methods of promoting the Castle Clash application have been targeted by the media.  Its advertising can be called banal spam, only the method of its distribution is not banal.  So, in the popular Tinder dating app, a lot of fake accounts of pretty ladies appeared who strongly recommend installing the Castle Clash app itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ebf/f4f/5a0/ebff4f5a0be1c4fdc6b0f1f26d9e5097.jpg"><br><br>  One of these dialogues is shown in the screenshot.  Tinder reported that they know about the problem and will delete spam accounts.  At the moment, the scale of the problem and the participation in the history of the Castle Clash publishers themselves, who could simply be compromised, is not certain for certain. <br><br><br><h4>  Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft went to soft lunch </h4><br>  Blizzard fans are cheering!  According <a href="https://twitter.com/appsfire/status/451469480032763904">to the</a> appsfire twitter (and he made it one of the first), the Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft application became available in three sites at once.  Soft-lunch (I want to believe that the product will reach our latitudes) happened, as often happens, in the most popular countries of the ‚Äúsoft launch‚Äù.  More specifically - in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. <br><br>  The application has already collected a good press.  If you suddenly do not know how much the legendary product got to mobile platforms, it's time to find an article about it in <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearthstone:_Heroes_of_Warcraft">Wikipedia</a> . <br><br><br><h4>  Mobile games blow Southeast Asia </h4><br>  The company Digi-Capital, operating in the investment sector, has published its forecasts regarding the volume of the Asian gaming market.  Thus, according to her estimates, by 2017 the total market volume will be $ 120 billion.  For comparison, in 2011 this figure was 70 billion. <br><br>  The <a href="http://www.pocketgamer.biz/asia/data-and-research/58705/japanese-korean-and-chinese-mobile-market-growth-will-drive-total-games-industry-to-120-billion-by-2017/">study</a> argues that the main locomotive of such growth is the segment of mobile and online games.  This affects the investment attractiveness of the region.  So, against the background of one and not very successful (at the moment) King's listing on the stock exchange, 4 game companies from China immediately entered the IPO in 2014.  It's only the beginning! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/218867/">https://habr.com/ru/post/218867/</a></p>
