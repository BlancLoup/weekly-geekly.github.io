  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Smarthalo - a system that will turn the life of a cyclist into a paradise</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f57/544/d77/f57544d773ada74f88144143e5767ccd.jpg"><br><br>  The Smarthalo system is intended, first of all, for cyclists who ride in the city.  Here and a reliable security system, and navigation system, and a fitness tracker for cyclists.  In addition, the system also includes lighting that works exactly when it is needed.  If the cyclist departed from his ‚Äúiron horse‚Äù, Smarthalo will reliably guard the bicycle. <br><br>  In general, all this sounds interesting, but is everything really good?  Let's look at Smarthalo for details. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Pivoting navigation </h3><br>  Cyclists often need a navigation system that is not inferior to car devices.  Plus, a cyclist usually doesn‚Äôt have much time to navigate, to look at the map in more detail.  Smarthalo developers claim that there will be no problems with this system.  You just need to connect Smarthalo to your mobile device, set a point to which you need to get, and start pedaling. 
      <br>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      Smarthalo will show whether the cyclist is going in the right direction.  If not, the indicator will show it.  If all is well, the green LED will shine soothingly and evenly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d52/41b/94e/d5241b94e71bd651789324897e1f7dfa.jpg"><br><br>  As it approaches, more and more green LEDs will light up, and the circle should become completely green at the target. <br><br><h3>  Fitness Tracking </h3><br>  Naturally, almost every bike owner would like to track his progress - how much distance is traveled, how fast, how many calories the cyclist burned.  Plus, the total arrival time and everything else - that you usually expect to see in such an application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1aa/9c0/99e/1aa9c099e09dec73c487c9695463caeb.jpg"><br><br>  There is also the ability to set goals, as well as track their achievement. <br><br><h3>  Illuminate the road </h3><br>  Smarthalo is equipped with a light sensor.  If it becomes dark, the LED light turns on.  If the cyclist stopped and moved away from the bike - the lighting immediately goes out.  If you need to go again, the lantern turns on.  Everything is organized quite reasonably and rationally. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/116/c67/a6d/116c67a6d57004f36256ed748f51f321.gif"><br><br><h3>  Notifications and weather </h3><br>  Cyclists, like no one else, will come from the weather.  If it starts to rain, and even a hurricane - the race becomes often impossible, and you have to look for shelter.  In order not to get wet in vain, Smarthalo warns the owner if the weather starts to deteriorate - the forecast is taken from the relevant services, using the Internet channel of the phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f88/a9e/80e/f88a9e80ea312aebb67b1fb44c56b30d.jpg"><br><br>  If someone calls, sends SMS or e-mail - Smarthalo will notify about it. <br><br><h3>  Safety system </h3><br>  If the device detects a hijacking attempt, the signal will immediately trigger.  How it works - you can look at the animation below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4e3/a6c/7c8/4e3a6c7c8febccab70f0e3f816936bd1.gif"><br><br>  The Watchman starts working as soon as the connection with the phone is lost.  If the system again detects a user's smartphone nearby, the security function is disabled. <br><br>  If just sat down the phone battery - no problem.  You need to touch the Smarthalo sensor surface a certain number of times in a certain way - the order of touches and their number is set in the settings. <br><br><h3>  application </h3><br>  Software application for a mobile device is quite simple - there should be no difficulty with using it.  In principle, everything is provided for. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e3f/b29/69c/e3fb2969cf34fc74402ccce0dd0586d8.png"><br><br><h3>  What else? </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/498/f8c/a39/498f8ca3924801f39d6458b91e13264b.gif"><br><br>  The system is designed to fit on any bike. <br><br><h3>  Where to buy and how much? </h3><br>  Now developers are still collecting funds for Smarthalo <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1106460188/smarthalo-turn-your-bike-into-a-smart-bike%3Fref%3Dpopular">on Kickstarter</a> .  The cost of the device after entering the market is $ 149.  In principle, inexpensive, given the full capabilities of the system.  Much more has been collected than planned, so you can be sure that this gadget will be on the market. <br><br>  Customers will receive Smarthalo in May 2016. <br><br><h3>  Invitation to test dadzhetov </h3><br>  The djadget invites authors interested in testing our devices and writing an objective review for cooperation.  The device after the publication of the review remains with you.  Read more about the offer <a href="http://dadget.ru/autors">here</a> . <br><br>  <b>Note:</b> Smarthalo is a gadget that is not yet on sale.  In the assortment of the company "Dadzhet" this system either. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368133/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368133/</a></p>
