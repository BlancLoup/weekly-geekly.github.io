Pretending to be poor, she mocked me for an hour.  And I had already decided to write in retaliation to write devastating text with erotic allusions and veiled profanity. <br>  However, the mind was enough to relax, breathe in the fresh November air, drink a cup of tea. <br>  I decided to give the game a second chance ... More precisely, to be honest, let it be completely disgraced. <br>  But the game did not justify categorical hopes and no longer wanted to disgrace.  From surprise, I lost it to three nights. <br>  And the next day - another four hours without a trace. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <strong>Third generation</strong> <br>  Now there is no doubt that the generation of games in the series Need for Speed ‚Äã‚Äãlasts exactly five episodes.  The first five issues of NFS are projects for which millions of gamers have prayed (for various reasons).  The next five are games where Electronic Arts tried to make Need for Speed ‚Äã‚Äãa nominal name for the most glamorous, the most averaged, the most fashionable, the most tasteless car parks.  And, of course, the most profitable. <br>  Need for Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãProSpeed ‚Äã‚Äãis somehow foolishly unwitting.  With the fashion in the game, something also went wrong - the first cars owned by the gamer here can be easily attributed to the ‚Äútrash‚Äù class.  Finally, ProSpeed ‚Äã‚Äãdoes not want to put on the already familiar jester's cap, call juicy girls to its video games and drive along the oily asphalt of cities at a speed of five hundred miles per hour. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/555/6fa/58a/5556fa58a6259bceb6789d96f6a51807.jpg" width="450" height="337" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  In short, after the first hour of playing NFS ProStreet, the picture looks like this: this game doesn‚Äôt have fun with thrash thrash like the previous five episodes, it doesn‚Äôt have the charm of the first five episodes, it has a terrible interface and style that only a ten-year-old child will like.  This is not an arcade game, this is not a simulator yet.  It is not too beautiful.  It is rather dull. <br>  In short, I would not blame those who erased NFS ProSpeed ‚Äã‚Äãafter an hour of dating. <br>  But they have no excuse ...

      <strong>Particular and general</strong> <br>  And yet, first it is worthwhile to deal with the effect of disgust, which arises at first.  This disgust captured not only your humble servant, but also many of those with whom your humble servant had time to talk about NFS ProSpeed.  If you collect all the complaints, you get the following small list: a cool interface, a terrifically adolescent career style, slurred driving physics, insensitive controls, low speeds, strange graphics, low complexity, a primitive auto modernization system ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/0bd/31b/197/0bd31b1973261537f735d3c842c3b51e.jpg" width="450" height="337" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  What to say to justify the game?  Unfortunately, practically nothing: to one degree or another, all claims are fair.  However, managing to cling somehow deftly one by one, the mass of minor flaws in NFS ProSpeed ‚Äã‚Äãsuddenly turn into one significant advantage.  Dignity is - a simple, but interesting gameplay.  The first hour, while the eyes and mind highlight the details and the outer side of things, it is inconspicuous.  But then, when the details merge into a single picture: logical, understandable, attracting - NFS ProStreet is softly transformed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/ec2/25a/bc9/ec225abc9578f28cc61ac7e830dc9b13.jpg" width="450" height="337" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  <strong>Business and money</strong> <br>  Compared with the gypsy series from the sixth to the tenth, NFS ProStreet is primarily pleased that there is nothing superfluous.  Before us is an honest race, without embellishments, without hysterics, without a strained plot with the use of second-hand photo models, without depressingly meaningless driving in pseudo-town. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/a04/5ce/f2d/a045cef2d0839fd9a376908251230c68.jpg" width="450" height="337" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  Career mode, if you brush away the small-asphalt raid of childhood, is simple and simple in the best traditions of classic auto-arcade.  It consists, relatively speaking, of the stages of a long journey.  Each subsequent stage is opened if the gamer has won in the prescribed number of competitions of the previous stage.  Competitions, they are also ‚Äúautosport holidays‚Äù, hang in clusters around the borehole, branching out and echoing a wide variety of disciplines.  These disciplines are race in a circle, drag racing, drift (driving with a controlled skid), sprint on supercars.  Each "day" consists of a number of disciplines - from four to seven.  By participating and winning races in a particular discipline, the player wins points and money.  The points go to the piggy bank of the account, and the money simply to the piggy bank or to pay for the cosmetic repair of the car (in case the gamer could not drive the track without emergency adventures). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/9cb/69f/096/9cb69f0960a2fc35a85bb5acea405311.jpg" width="450" height="337" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  From the point of view of personal progress, for a gamer each competitive day is divided by two marks (expressed in glasses): victory and complete domination.  To win a competition, you must win about half of the disciplines or come second or third in all.  To dominate - to win all the disciplines of the day.  After the victory is won, gamers are given a little money and a prize that accidentally fell out of the lottery (part for modernization, a coupon for a free repair, money ...).  After domination - another prize and a lot of money.  Thus, although the game does not require you to go through all the competitions to the end, the thirst for profit pushes the gamer to heroism. <br><br>  <strong>Art of losing</strong> <br>  Actually, if you look carefully, this heroism is small.  The tracks in NFS ProSpeed ‚Äã‚Äãare thought out and made so great that any person with at least a little brains and skills in the game of car rides can easily bypass rivals.  Even, sorry for the intimate detail, on the keyboard controls. <br>  Truth: to lose, in NFS Pro Speed ‚Äã‚Äãyou have to really try.  For example, it is cynical not to upgrade a car for several competitions in a row.  So that, in the end, your rivals will bypass you at least twice in terms of technical characteristics. <br>  And you can also assign a machine that does not correspond to it constructively to discipline.  The fact is that NFS ProSpeed ‚Äã‚Äãallows the gamer to keep the whole fleet in personal use, purposefully ‚Äúpumping‚Äù each car in accordance with the requirements of the discipline.  That is, it is clear: it is better to put light and powerful race cars on drag racing, maneuverable on the track, super-speed on the sprint.  Nevertheless, the game does not at all force to use just such a recipe for success: you are free to register for the ‚Äúdrag‚Äù of a tank-like monster that the American auto industry of the 1970s was famous for. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/397/149/6c7/3971496c7c84a3a3139c4ea8ff948f42.jpg" width="450" height="337" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  <strong>Reasonable beauty</strong> <br>  Cars in the NFS ProStreet presented enough.  There are middle-class ‚ÄúEuropeans‚Äù, track supercars, classics from the time of disco, and expensive toys of billionaires and omnipresent Muscovites.  Understanding that a gamer is simply not able to buy and try out all this wealth throughout the Career, the game learned tricks from the repertoire of the Grand Turismo 4 platform. Sometimes designers (as goodwill) give out a couple of new wheelbarrows for the next competition.  Instead of available.  Pure - steer. <br>  The pleasure of riding on unknown wheeled "little animals" is all the more so that their repair also takes place at official expense. <br>  The modernization and tuning system in NFS ProStreet can be called standard for the current generation of auto-arcades.  Faceless details with a few people talking about "real" names are some notional amount and raise one of the three characteristics of the car (for different classes of cars, they differ slightly) by some conditional points. <br>  Significant tuning for technical indicators (false thresholds, fenders, wheels, tires) is also worth the money, but you can already paint a car and stick all kinds of seductive stickers on it for free. <br>  In general, it is noticeable that tuning (in the broad sense of the word) has ceased to be a fetish for NFS developers.  Moreover, clearly visible attempt to return the modernization of the car in the direction of rationality and feasibility. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/150/0d2/4e9/1500d24e93169ec67245c8922d8dbcb7.jpg" width="450" height="337" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  <strong>Pereparkadny nedosimulyator</strong> <br>  Some players mention the unkind arcade habits of NFS ProStreet - de, the game is not averse to giving odds to computer opponents, especially in the second half of the ‚Äúcareer‚Äù passage. <br>  On the other hand, driving dynamics, management features and small nuances in no way allow us to attribute NFS ProSpeed ‚Äã‚Äãto riotous ‚Äúrides‚Äù. <br>  The game is really rather severe (ill-wishers say poorly) sticks to the golden mean between simulation and arcade.  For example, rear and front-wheel drive differ very well.  But all sorts of models of machines of approximately the same type and class are already rather weak.  The speed, even very high, is perceived by a gamer as a kind of leisurely ride around the outskirts.  At the same time, the machine performs well the effects inherent in high speed - poor maneuverability, inertia. <br>  Multi-user part of NFS ProStreet can not be called too outstanding - affects multi-platform development.  However, the standard organization of races, all sorts of record tables and exchange of tuning is present. <br>  Generally, as a game of the new time, NFS ProStreet is very grateful for the constant high-speed connection to its servers. <br><br>  <strong>Attempt to revival</strong> <br>  NFS ProStreet has everything you need to scare a gamer.  First, the absolute dissimilarity from previous games in the series.  Secondly, the completely foolish style of ‚Äúdrawings on asphalt‚Äù. <br>  In addition, there is beautiful graphics - about which you will not immediately say that she is beautiful.  And also an interesting and addictive gameplay - at first it somehow resembles a race of mining trolleys drawn by a pair of oxen. <br>  Finally, it should be said that the game is quite simple in every sense of the word.  There is no beautiful concrete metropolis here, attractive silicone does not show here, here natural landscapes are brought to the edge of the horizon and are fenced off by bump stops and barriers. <br>  In short, we didn‚Äôt wait for this under the guise of Need for Speed.  Equally unlike both the first NFS games and the last, Pro Street gives gamers a very strange feeling. <br>  Among which: disgust, bewilderment, surprise, affection, desire, interest.  And, you will not believe, hope. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/16921/">https://habr.com/ru/post/16921/</a></p>
