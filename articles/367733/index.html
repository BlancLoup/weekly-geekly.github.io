  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Qualitative quadrocopter for $ 30? Let's look at SYMA X13</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Syma has already delighted us with its products.  The legendary Syma X5, who introduced tens of thousands of people to the world of quadcopters.  You can also remember the tiny Syma X12, which has already <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/244822/">responded</a> well to GeekTimes.  And last week we talked about <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/253352/">Syma X5SW</a> , which also pleased us with its characteristics.  Therefore, when the <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/zq">Syma X13</a> appeared in our hands, we expected to see another high-quality product from Syma. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/98f/d13/8d9/98fd138d944945ebaf77ea8061823521.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of all, pay attention to the size of the quadcopter.  It is 2 times more than Syma X12 and 2 times less than Syma X5.  Size can be estimated on my palm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/429/aac/5c4/429aac5c464a471980dff4543f9e3adb.jpg">

        </script>
      <br>
      Or in a visual comparison with Syma X5C <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1d4/9c2/e00/1d49c2e0039a4299a3cbc0e9f355841f.jpg"><br><br>  And, understanding the size, you can say this is a quadrocopter for home use with the ability to go fly into the yard.  It is natural to run it in the field for hundreds of meters - no need.  However, it will not work.  Its signal range is 30 meters, which I consider to be quite adequate for this size. <br><br>  I spent the first flight tests in my apartment and the first thing that caught my eye, but rather sounded in my head: ‚Äúwhat a wonderful, pleasant control panel‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e3/454/414/0e345441400b4b3fb5dc08271ca3ba6f.jpg"><br><br>  Yes, it has 4 batteries, that's good.  But pay attention to the rustles on the handles.  We immediately see that the manufacturer thought through everything to the smallest detail.  And also look, please, carefully at the sticks of the WlToys, DJI, Syma x5 and Syma x13 controllers, do you see the difference? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/609/6c8/2a3/6096c82a318f4173b6ca3645bd29b5b5.jpg"><br><br>  Soft pleasant pads instead of scratching, penetrating into the skin - iron sticks.  My thumbs were very grateful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/325/aa9/712/325aa971236c40dd95e3f5158c5b1cca.jpg"><br><br>  But not only the remote distinguished its forethought.  This time, Syma thought the battery compartment very well. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/970/617/c22/970617c22d404a3094df08a99bae99e3.jpg"><br><br>  In the very center of the quadcopter, a special section was made, where the 3.7V 200mAh battery is very conveniently removed.  The volume looks small, but it is typical for quadcopters of this weight group.  It allows for a clean flight time of about 5-6 minutes.  And with periodic drops / crashes during pampering with a copter - it was enough for 9 minutes. <br><br>  Separately, I want to draw attention to one more pleasant trifle - the quadrocopter power switch.  That is, when we insert and connect a battery, the quadcopter does not turn on.  To enable, a toggle switch on the quadcopter surface is separately displayed.  That is, we can first insert the batteries, and turn on when you are ready to fly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e11/b1a/4b7/e11b1a4b764c4fb79fc144ddeceae917.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Equipment</b> <br>  In general, there is nothing unusual in the configuration, the usual set for Syma: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e5e/41f/7ae/e5e41f7aee2d4c249dbfc93ba84fc3d8.jpg"><br>  - quadcopter <br>  - controller <br>  - Charger <br>  - 4 spare screws <br>  - battery <br>  - instruction in English <br><br>  <b>Functions</b> <br>  It is worth noting that the quadcopter received a 6-axis stabilization system, which allows you to straighten up from any position.  Although to throw upside down and gas to the full - as the cat turns, but does not land on its feet, and will remain hanging in the air. <br><br>  The expected quadcopter can do ‚Äúflips‚Äù, that is, flips to all 4 sides, with the help of one button.  And makes them very impressive.  It always amuses my guests. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b7/7cb/0b5/9b77cb0b50484c4aa6a5353a9340850c.jpg"><br><br>  Also, this small quadcopter can control costs, that is, it can fly in low battery mode, and it can fly in full gas mode.  To change the mode, just press and hold the left button for a couple of seconds until the desired signal is heard. <br><br>  And the most interesting feature is the ‚ÄúHeadFree‚Äù.  That is, he remembers when taking off the direction of take-off (according to the compass).  And when you want to return it to yourself - you need to stand face to where the quadrocopter was sent and press the right stick back.  Then he fly in your direction.  However, it should be borne in mind that if you sent it to the north, but it was blown to the east, then it will fly to the south to your right, that is, a little to the east. <br><br>  <b>Material</b> <br>  The material of the case and screws, traditionally for Syma, is sturdy.  The screws, though small, are also clear that they are made a little wider than usual.  I believe that not only to improve the flight performance, it is in order to withstand all the blows of fate. <br><br>  Tactile, too, everything is very nice and looks very expensive, although it costs less than $ 30. <br><br>  Packed, by the way, also on the level. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0a6/21e/1be/0a621e1beff0459ba653cf7b5793e37a.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Control</b> <br>  Particularly pleased with the management.  I do not know how they achieved this for a quadrocopter of this size, but it is much more obedient and more stable than the famous Hubsan X4.  X13 really can be made to hang on the spot, without constantly steering sticks. <br><br>  I believe that such obedience will greatly help beginning copterovodam quickly master the acquisition of flight skills. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dcd/10b/8b7/dcd10b8b7308463b959fb0c0ffaa3f14.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Findings:</b> <br>  Definitely a toy.  5 minutes of flight time.  Small size.  Such a quadcopter will not make you a cool selfie and will not transmit live broadcast from a height, but its small size has its own charm.  Personally, I fell in love with this quadrocopter.  For its nice remote, for its amazing handling, for its flawless design, for the quality of workmanship and assembly, for its functionality and of course for its price of <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/yv">$ 29.90</a> :) <br><br>  That's all, successful flight, you wish service on the choice of quadrocopters <a href="http://dronk.ru/">Dronk.Ru</a> <br><br>  Do not forget to subscribe to our <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/">blog</a> , there will be many more interesting things. <br><br>  <b>UPD .:</b> <br>  Several times asked about the extra batteries and screws. <br>  I decided to add links to the post: <br>  - <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/yw">Screws</a> <br>  - <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/yx">Battery</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367733/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367733/</a></p>
