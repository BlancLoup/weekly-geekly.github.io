      So what is ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù?  When a person says ‚ÄúI understand‚Äù what happened?  What happens when a person does not understand?  What is the process of "understanding"?  Is this an instantaneous transition or a gradual accumulation? <br><br>  In most cases, the question ‚Äúwhat it means to understand‚Äù confuses the interlocutor.  Understanding seems to be something very natural and quite obvious, if you do not consider what it means intently and biasedly. <br><br>  Most often, understanding is seen as a kind of insight into the meaning, a comparison of disparate facts into a single canvas, a situation. <br>  Understanding is closely related to some certainty, clarity, predictions of something that has not yet been discovered, but in connection with understanding it will be revealed if attention is paid to it. <br><br>  I suggest habravchanam participate in the survey below and offer their comments on the question of what is the understanding. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Basic introduction to understanding the process of understanding </h4><br><br>  In order to describe the author's model of understanding, you will need to enter a small diagram of relationships <br><br>  Consider several aspects of understanding <br>  1. Understanding how the goal <br>  2. Understanding how the state <br>  3. Understanding how the process <br>  4. Understanding how to support <br><br><h5>  Understanding how the goal </h5><br>  One can imagine the whole process of sensory perception as purposeful actions leading to a good recognition of the situation: what this situation consists of, what changes in it, what motives and limitations act.  Simply put, each creature is oriented in a situation as well as it is in this situation that it distinguishes something useful and harmful for itself, how correctly it evaluates the availability of useful resources and the necessary costs for their development, how accurately it predicts the development of the situation and those acting in this situation. forces, trends, motives. <br><br>  Thus, the purpose of life lies in the ability to understand the situation, to consider it as sets of guidelines for the movement of attention and application of effort. <br><br>  It is good if participants comment on the target aspect of understanding.  Is it clear what is at stake?  Is it helpful to consider understanding in this aspect? <br><br><h5>  Understanding how the state </h5><br>  You may find that we are able to assess the degree of understanding of the situation.  Simply put, understanding is not immeasurable.  A person is aware of how the degree of understanding changes, whether it is sufficient or insufficient, whether the reference points are obvious, to which attention should be paid later or not, whether a high degree of concentration or sufficiently peripheral attention is required. <br><br>  Simply put, a state assessed as a degree of understanding, quite specifically, but at the same time, understanding the degree of understanding is in turn an aspect of understanding in general, and a common mechanism of understanding is used for this assessment.  Here we are faced with feedback when the process evaluates itself. <br><br><h5>  Understanding how the process </h5><br>  We can easily make sure that the understanding unfolds from the presentation to the presentation, revealing the connections, generalizing and refining the details, again and again.  It can be found that attention is directed both ‚Äúupward‚Äù, summarizing something and reducing the number of representations in the context of understanding, replacing the disparate ‚Äútable, chairs, cups, spoons, stove, refrigerator‚Äù into a generalized ‚Äúkitchen‚Äù, or ‚Äúdown‚Äù, isolating from the general ideas of a particular, which should be given attention in order to make the understanding of the situation more relevant and useful <br><br><h5>  Understanding how to prop </h5><br>  The important point is that attention is constantly moving from one context of understanding to another.  To understand something, you need to build on something that is already clear.  Understanding does not add up at once from nothing, it is always a sequence of acts of generalization and clarification in the field of ideas about the actual situation <br><br>  What is less volatile is stored in the context of understanding the situation and provides an opportunity to explore the situation faster.  If we are in the kitchen, we can already expect a certain structure of ideas about the situation in the kitchen, we can quickly cut off assumptions that would be less relevant to the current context and prospects for the situation <br><br><h4>  Is it possible to prove that understanding is the key mechanism of intelligence? </h4><br><br>  Let us formulate for the time being only the hypothesis that everything that we encounter in the study of intelligence is a mechanism of understanding.  All other mechanisms, such as memory, perception, behavior, are only consequences of this mechanism, inseparable from it. <br><br>  What could be the evidence of this hypothesis?  Is it possible to formulate a hypothesis as a theorem and prove it?  At the moment, for me it is a question of the formalization of the whole theory of artificial intelligence. <br><br>  Therefore, before we proceed to the formalization of this hypothesis, in the following articles I will reveal the origin of memory, perception and behavior on the basis of the mechanism of understanding. <br><br><h4>  Your questions and criticisms regarding the mechanism of understanding </h4><br><br>  I would be happy to answer your questions and disclose the mechanism more deeply, if you wish, in the comments to the publication. <br>  It would be sad to finally lose karma, which is barely enough to publish an article, so let me ask you to be a little indulgent, if possible. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/190080/">https://habr.com/ru/post/190080/</a></p>
