I note immediately that the purpose of creating a business was to gain experience with contextual advertising platforms (including advertising in social networks)

    <h4>  Disclaimer </h4><br><h5>  About business, prehistory </h5><br><br>  From January 1, I decided to try different ways of advertising for the sale of virtual goods.  The product was chosen - the creation of sites, logos, video presentations.  A year ago, I bought a beautiful, as it seems to me, domain biz.biz.ua, which was parked idle, so I decided to place the site on it. <br><br>  Initially, I prepared texts for the site, there is no big copyright in SEO, but after reading a few good articles, I decided to investigate the cost of creating such texts.  Quickly cooked up a copyright <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer%3Fa%3Dv%26pid%3Dexplorer%26chrome%3Dtrue%26srcid%3D0B_HcyN47A6fnOGZiYmQ4MGMtM2M2Ny00ZmQzLWIyYzAtMTU0MzMxMDQwYTY0%26hl%3Den">specification</a> for the project and turned to freelancing. <br><br>  The prices offered were completely different, but they mostly ranged from $ 3-5 per 1000 characters without spaces (this is slightly less than half of the A4 10pt Arial page in font).  Were ready to fulfill an order for $ 10, but given my knowledge of SEO copyright, as I already wrote above - several articles from the copyright section on Habr√©, I could not adequately assess the quality of articles.  I didn‚Äôt want to order for $ 3 either - it seemed that people only read the title of the ad and didn‚Äôt even open the spec.  Therefore I turned to a friend who wrote me this text. <br><br>  The text posted on the website and <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/club22842698">group</a> , <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/public22942205">page</a> vkontakte.  At the same time it was decided to buy advertising vkontakte. <br><br><h4>  Advertising VKONTAKTE </h4><br><br>  I added 500 rubles to my account, creating 5 different announcements (for advertising 3 products - a logo, a website, a video presentation).  Promotional messages looked like this: <br><img src="http://img705.imageshack.us/img705/4446/screenshot20110129at107.png" alt="image"><br>  The following picture is the result of the advertising campaign.  It lasted 6 days, the average click on the ad ranged from 3 to 4.14 rubles, <u>transitions: 220</u> <u>views: 2,262,878</u> , CTR, respectively, turned out to be very small. <br> <a href="http://img42.imageshack.us/i/screenshot20110129at104.png/"><img src="http://img42.imageshack.us/img42/9799/screenshot20110129at104.th.png"></a> <br><br>  Criteria for target ads used: <br>  Interests: business, private business, internet business, self-employed. <br>  Country Ukraine. <br>  Age: 24 - 40. <br><br>  <b>The result of the advertising campaign:</b> during this period I received 1 phone call.  Customers 0. <br><br>  Later, I decided to try google adwords, I had a check for 30 euros, plus credited another 10, and started the campaign there. <br><br><h4>  Google AdWords Campaign </h4><br><br>  This tool seemed to me quite powerful and frightening abundance of settings and tools for the most accurate getting into the heart of its buyer. <br><br>  Created several ads of different content, by type: <br>  Website for 72 hours <br>  199 $ Order now! <br>  Without prepayment <br>  <a href="http://www.biz.biz.ua/">www.biz.biz.ua</a> <br><br>  Keywords: <br>  ‚ÄúOrder a website, order a website, order a website cheaply, order a website inexpensively,‚Äù etc.  There are more 10 such words containing the keywords ‚Äúorder‚Äù and ‚Äúwebsite‚Äù, since  I did not want my ad to be displayed for those who are looking to create a site for free or instructions on how to create a site.  That is, the target user who wants to order / buy the site. <br><br>  Country: Ukraine (all regions). <br><br>  The advertising campaign statistics were slightly better compared to VKontakte, as it seemed to me.  <u>Clicks: 298.</u> <u>Views: 387 227</u> .  In Google AdWords, the advertising campaign management interface is much more convenient, after an hour of work, I intuitively moved to the necessary sections to create advertising.  Created 3 different categories of ads: Website, Logo, Video, and in each of them posted a few ads.  In some he indicated the phone number in the body, in some he left more promotional text.  At first I made a mistake and did not limit the price per click, so I spent 18 euros for 3 clicks on the keyword ‚Äúorder website‚Äù on the first day, it‚Äôs good that the daily budget limited 20 euros :) <br><br>  Then I set a dynamic CPC (I still think this is the best option) by limiting the maximum CPC to 0.20 euros.  The average cost per click ranged from 0.12 - 0.13 euros. <br> <a href="http://img121.imageshack.us/i/screenshot20110129at118.png/"><img src="http://img121.imageshack.us/img121/4598/screenshot20110129at118.th.png"></a> <br><br>  <b>The result of the advertising campaign:</b> 0 calls, 1 client who filled out the form on the site. <br><br><h4>  Advertising Yandex.Direct </h4><br><br>  Yesterday I registered in this context, I chose similar keywords with advanced and approximately the same ads. <br>  I did not like the fact that you can not add a phone number to the ads.  Ads are moderated for a long time.  Removed 20% VAT when paying an advertising campaign. <br><br>  <b>The result of the campaign:</b> During the day there were 2 clicks, customers 0. I continue to watch. <br><br>  I would like to find a convenient way to advertise these products.  My experiments described above did not help me determine the contextual advertising budget, because  conversion was minimal. <br><br><h4>  The cost and effort to create the site went to $ -2. </h4><br><br><h5>  $ 129 in total was spent on advertising: </h5><br>  - advertising of VKontakte group $ 40 (10K invitations that did not bring results, may be due to poor-quality invitations, or maybe just as ineffective advertising, but made sure that I don‚Äôt make any more orders for invitations) <br>  - advertising in Google Advords - $ 55 <br>  - advertising vkontakte context - $ 17 <br>  - advertising in Yandex Direct - $ 17 <br><br><h5>  The cost of manufacturing the site was $ 72: </h5><br>  - hosting for 1 year (I have VDS, which I plan to change, so maybe habraeffekt and not stand, according to preliminary calculations for a client in the year $ 48 for hosting) <br>  - domain in the region region.ua - $ 4 <br>  - website template - $ 20 <br><br>  Of course, I did not take into account the time for re-design, re-layout of the template under the client's requirements, but let's attribute this expense to the experience and let us consider that I also went to 0, as well as the work done on the context. <br><br>  It is interesting to hear from more experienced people.  I would welcome any comments. <br><br>  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112787/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112787/</a></p>
