Recently, I wondered why people often hold on to work that does not bring them satisfaction, but they still go there for years.  The results of reflections and conclusions as possible to increase the motivation cited in this article. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I divided all possible options into 5 groups: <br><ol><li>  Salary </li><li>  Working conditions </li><li>  Interesting job </li><li>  Career prospects </li><li>  Personal growth opportunities </li></ol><br>  Here I did not consider options when there is only one city-forming enterprise in the village and 100,500 people work there out of hopelessness, as well as other depressive scenarios. <br><br><h4>  Salary. </h4><br>  If you are motivated by everyone to go to work, only a salary is the worst option, especially in government organizations.  This employee may still be at the corporate culture, at the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the company, he may practically not communicate with the team, and as soon as the payment ceases to arrange him, he will most likely leave. <br>  For 6-9 months a person gets used to any salary, but what does it mean getting used to?  This means that he begins to procrastinate (for more details on this, see the article ‚Äú <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/300632/">Why procrastinators procrastinate ...</a> ‚Äù), productivity drops and he starts working ‚Äúas usual‚Äù.

      Tying an employee to KPI is also not always effective. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúWe need to set big hairy, daring goals, want to make a dent in the universe.  A person should know for the sake of what is laid out, and not just want to achieve half a percent more than his colleague " <br>  Tom Peters. <br></blockquote><br>  There are two interesting approaches here: <br><ol><li>  McKinney and some other progressive companies have an ‚Äú <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_or_out">Up or out‚Äù</a> approach.  The employee must constantly develop, improve their skills.  As soon as he stops doing this, they point him to the door. </li><li>  Oleg Torbosov, the founder of a very progressive HR agency, says that he does not pay salaries to his employees in companies, there is not even a basic salary.  Only interest from profit.  Salesman gets% of sales;  HR gets a salary depending on the number of new employees who went to work;  the operations director gets a% of the company's turnover, etc. </li></ol><br>  The best solution here is not to hire those employees who are only interested in salary and do not share corporate values. <br>  I wrote in the first article about one of my friends (" <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/299366/">Why do not we achieve the goals we set</a> ").  Here, one of his words is as appropriate as possible. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúI can't come to work at 8 o'clock.  I agreed to a salary, not a job. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><h4>  Working conditions </h4><br>  Almost the same as ‚ÄúSalary‚Äù, but here employees are interested in other factors.  For example, in universities, many people work for a small salary just because they are given a hostel and maybe they will someday be given an apartment or they can combine work and study in this way. <br>  Maybe like a work schedule at which you can combine this work with some other more interesting or highly paid. <br>  Here, people most often fall into the comfort zone and prefer to work even for a small salary for years without changing anything. <br><br><h4>  Interesting job </h4><br>  If you find a job that you like and where you can realize yourself, consider yourself very lucky, just like your employer. <br>  This is especially important for young people.  For our generation, it is imperative that work brings pleasure.  Finishing vocational schools and going to work at the plant is not about us.  Since the environment in which we grew up changed very quickly, most of the features inherent in receiving immediate remuneration for the work done, absolute disbelief in the long term.  When such a person is told that it takes ten years to work for a secure life, he replies: ‚ÄúWhat are ten years?  We may have another country in ten years.  Ten years ago there was no fast Internet, no smartphones, no wearable electronics. <br><br><h4>  Career prospects. </h4><br>  For those who want a career in the corporate sector, it is important to get a job in the company of your dreams, even at some not very prestigious position and work hard.  It seems obvious things, but what was obvious to our parents is not so obvious to us.  We think that we will come so beautiful after the institute and they will immediately take us to a good position, with a decent salary and a secretary with long legs. <br>  I myself first thought about it when I read David Schwartz's book The Art of Big Think. <br>  Moreover, if an intelligent employee arrives, then it is worthwhile to look at him and create conditions under which he will stay with you for a long time (see the next paragraph). <br><br><h4>  Personal growth opportunities </h4><br>  Here they are not going to the post, but to a specific boss. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúLearn from your bosses or change your bosses. <br>  If he does not teach, why do you need such a boss. ‚Äù <br>  Igor Mann, marketer </blockquote><br>  Previously, young people came to apprentices to a famous blacksmith, gunsmith or other artisan to learn from him the skill and then continue his school. <br>  From the standpoint of personal growth, the most optimal situation is when the boss is a perfectionist, and the subordinate is a lazy or procrastinator.  I wrote about this in the article ‚Äú <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/300632/">Why procrastinators prokrastrinirut ...</a> ‚Äù. <br>  At the same time, dear managers, keep in mind that such an employee should be interested in you for a long time, otherwise he will receive the necessary knowledge and experience from you.  Therefore, the chief must grow with his subordinates, otherwise after a while they will not be interested with you. <br>  Personal growth and professional growth can also be stimulated by creating opportunities for creativity and giving tasks that require constant development. <br><br>  So, summing up, we can say that the worst option is when an employee comes for a high salary and does not share the value of the company, and the best is for an interesting job, then the motivation is long enough. <br><br>  And if the work has ceased to be interesting, think about how to make it interesting.  Pay more attention to the category of important, but not urgent matters; reduce to a minimum the number of unimportant, not urgent matters.  Life will sparkle with new colors (on the use of the Esenhenour matrix in organizing the case, you can read more in the article <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/300346/">‚ÄúLaziness as a sign of genius. 4 types of laziness and is it worth fighting against it‚Äù</a> ). <br><br>  Remember, the two main and most effective motivators are interest and vanity. <br><br>  Hardware (for in-depth study): <br><ol><li>  Schwartz D. The art of thinking big.  M .: Popuri, 2008. </li><li>  Peters T. Imagine!  Excellence in business in an era of destruction.  M .: BestBusinessBooks, 2011. </li><li>  Dergunova T.
