Here is the original text: <br><br><blockquote>  According to rzelulattas are ilseadonal odongo unlegisokgo univertiset, they do not have a date, in which cocoa cake there are salvaged bouquats in salt.  Gavvone, chotbay preavaya and plopendyaya bkvuy blyi on mset.  Osatlyne bokva mgout seldovti in ploonm bsepordyak, all-torn tkest chtaitsey without browning.  The pichrion egoto is the fact that we cite not with each other on a separate basis, but everything is solicitous. </blockquote><br><br>  In the English version, it sounded like this: <br><blockquote>  Arocdnicg to rsceearch at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it is not a rule, it is not necessary, it is not necessary to get it out of it.  You can‚Äôll sit it up wouthit pobelrm.  Tihs is a buseace of the huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by istlef, but the wrod as a wlohe. </blockquote>

      An attempt to experiment with different texts showed that with the Russian language everything is not so cloudless as with English and the algorithm of efficient and readable mixing is still a bit different. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Referring to the works of a certain <a href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/personal/matt.davis/Cmabrigde/">Matt Davis</a> , who, in turn, refers to Rawlinson, GE as early as 1976 ( <a href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/matt.davis/Cmabrigde/rawlinson.html">summary</a> ). <br><br>  I was not lazy and wrote a simple program that processes texts.  From where I found out that it is not quite as it was stated, but the truth is somewhere nearby. <br><br>  So, if you change the middle of words completely arbitrarily, you get the following: <br><br><blockquote>  On Oklismpyiih games ssyaoislto zhskiene konyandme srnnovaoveiya on sooipvrtny gmksinatie Zutoloyu medla Games zolvaveaa sranobya US soeaboscht oaltsifniy syat Oalpimidy Vtoore Mtesa zyaalni ptertliadistsnvey roskosisyy kdaomny kotraoya vriygala for nnaiotsonlay sbnrooy vrot srerbeo srerebo sonobry Riossi pnslriea teaktlotzhleyaa Svltnaea Tsavakreua Brvoounzyu naradgu piucholli rinskymue gksaminti. <br></blockquote><br><br>  In principle, it is understandable, but it is worthwhile to take the words more genuinely, as the text becomes unrecognizable: <br><br><blockquote>  Vlrtachesi pisunrak in Kalokagnsidrnim mesokom market will spend a short 65-leite short time these days.  In honor of the port of Pkardniz podrepnos padorok kalidingnatsram and ryrshazel with breeding pichorod on torriteriya.  All zhischuylae able to visit Xerushnretn.  Such an attitude is not chadso.  As a prankish day on board Kzreunshrten Pinusrak Mugot, the guests of the Mornudozhadnye Mirxoh Pradnzikov in the inland martins and yellow Kalinargida. <br></blockquote><br><br>  But if it is a rule to keep the positions of consonants and vowels, freely changing between separately vowels and consonants, the result is slightly more readable and understandable with the same chaos: <br><br><blockquote>  On Okisliypmih games syassootil zhiknsee kydonnmae sovinronevaya on snirpovtoy gymnastics Zotoluyu Madeleine Games zalaoveva Team USA soobscheat oliiatsnfy site Olampiidy second Metso took ptsidvlaretensity riskossyoy kadomny which vailryga for naooninltsay sronboy second sererbo seberro snorboy Russian psinelra totelaeklyatzha Stevlana Tsavuraeka Bvonzoruyu Nadraga pochulili runimskye gisnatmki. <br></blockquote><br><br>  and for the second text <br><br><blockquote>  Vlchaseti Pisanruk in Kigidonnasklam as a moksrom fishing port which these days celebrated the 65-liter.  On the port of Pkinzrad, the port of Piedornes Parodok Kagidannlarcim expanded the passage on the torriyteu.  All stinging Xerrushnretn psetoty.  This kind of vapedite is not often.  Like pivilaro pyaysodnya on board a picarsun mugot gotsi myrdozhanondekh mrskoh pzanrdikov in inantrony partoh and yellow Kanilargdina see the masts of "Kzerushnrenta" toklo through his cost. <br></blockquote><br><br>  Now we will make another small change - we will add the maximum distance between the characters to be swapped into 3 characters so that the consonant from the beginning of the word does not fly to its end.  We also add an account of the fact that more than once the characters cannot be transferred.  As a result, the text comes out, from which almost everything is already clear: <br><br><blockquote>  Pasternberries were sprinkled in Kalinirgnakdom by the long-distance fishing port of the Kotyra on these days celebrating the 65th body.  On Thursday, the priest presented a gift to the kinaligradtsam and rarzeshil free education on the territory.  All wishing to visit Krunesztern.  Such a possibility of losing not chats.  As guests can board a sailboat, guests of the inter-coast marine parasites in the mountains can get on board, and the Kinalignr dwellers can see the masts of Kzerutschnern only through the port board. <br></blockquote><br><br>  As a result, it turns out that not everything is so rosy for the Russian language as it is for English, with its short words.  But if you slightly change the algorithm, the general idea still works. <br><br>  I wonder if there is an opportunity to add more noise in the middle of the word while maintaining readability and clarity? <br><br>  UPDATE: <br>  <b><a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/torkve/" class="user_link">torkve</a> writes:</b> <br><blockquote>  <i>It seems to me that it is more correct to try to do something like your last algorithm, only to develop the idea a little bit:</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>1. Fix the first and last characters of the word.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>2. From the remaining take the first three characters, randomly shuffled.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>3. From the received new three we fix the first two.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>4. Repeat point 2 until the unfixed characters run out.</i> <i><br></i> </blockquote><br><br>  I practically did it, but it‚Äôs worth fixing in paragraph 3 not the first two, but the first three.  Otherwise, one letter can travel to the end of the word.  Here's what happened: <br><br><blockquote>  The canvas in Klaininagrdskii Krasnoyarsk Territory was lost on the 65th anniversary of these days.  In the port of the port, the port of Predones Kailninrgatsdam and the Red Cross led to the tratroyi.  Everyone who wanted to eat Kzrushenetrn.  Weaving is not a chapso vypaaedt.  As parvilo pdontyasya on the broth of Prowain, the motogt of internals of the mosriks of holidays in the insular protas, and the houses of Kaliinnaggda wilt the Kurzneshtern masts through the wall of the prtoa. <br></blockquote><br><br>  It turns out nothing like that. <br><br>  UPDATE2.  I decided to check what will happen if you remove almost all vowels - do not touch the beginning and the ends of words.  After all, in the same Arabic or Hebrew there are practically no - they are consonants.  Here is what comes out of an arbitrary text from Turgenev's Noble Nest: <br><br><blockquote>  <i>Mrya Dmtrievna in the young she felt the reproduction of the millionth blndnki;</i>  <i>and in the ptsdt lt the chrts of her are not near pleasant, htya nanngo rspkhli and splits.</i>  <i>She blah blea chvstvtlnna, nzhli dbra, and before zllh lt shrnla inststtskie zmshki;</i>  <i>she had sbya, lightly horned and dzhe akkla, because she had her prvchki;</i>  <i>This is her honor and love, because all her wives are full and she has not been sent.</i>  <i>Dm her prndlzhl to the most pleasant in Grade.</i>  <i>The distance between her is vsma hrshshe, not only slshdstvnnoe, how many blnpriobrtnnoe mzhm.</i>  <i>both were living with her;</i>  <i>Sn pptvlsya in one of the best kznn zddny in Prbrbrge.</i> </blockquote><br><br>  Surprisingly, without vowels, absolutely everything is clear.  And the text shrank to 34 percent. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/148896/">https://habr.com/ru/post/148896/</a></p>
