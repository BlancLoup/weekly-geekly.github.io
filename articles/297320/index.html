      If once <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/uroki-kotorye-izvlekli-iz-svoix-neudach-7-ochen-uspeshnyx-lyudej/">we have chosen the path of leadership</a> , we must live it.  This requires a system.  I call it ‚ÄúThe Daily March‚Äù, taking over from Jim Collins‚Äôs book ‚ÄúGreat by Choice‚Äù, which says you need to keep up with your 20 miles daily, even if you are tempted to drop everything and stop too is great. <br><br>  Of course, everyone will have their own ‚Äúdaily 20 miles,‚Äù the main thing is to motivate yourself and others to achieve the goal.  Collins explains that the ‚Äú20-mile march‚Äù is more than just a philosophy.  This is the mechanism that runs into you and allows you to stay afloat. <br><br>  This march creates two types of voluntary discomfort for leaders: <br><br>  <font color="#0071c5">1) unwavering commitment to the need for high performance in difficult conditions;</font> <font color="#0071c5"><br></font>  <font color="#0071c5">2) discomfort from ‚Äúrolling back‚Äù, restraint in favorable conditions.</font> <br><br>  Yes, there are many services that in one way or another help to learn a foreign language.  But I really felt uncomfortable with the fact that in my head there are just passively stored ideas that can benefit people.  And yes, despite the fact that now it is only heard that about the crisis, I believe that we must not sit back, hold back and wait, and <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/10-potryasayushhix-biznes-urokov-ot-izvestnogo-predprinimatelya/">work hard, creating something new</a> , which will be in demand under these conditions. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">We set the pace</font> </h2><br>  If we are inconsistent and contradictory - our teams will be the same.  If we never seem to leave the office, then our employees will also wonder if they should do the same. <br><br>  If we can find and demonstrate the right rhythm, our teams will understand that steady progress towards their goals is what we are striving for. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúFinancial markets are beyond your control.  Clients are also beyond your control.  Earthquakes - and even more so.  World rivalry is also not dependent on you.  Technological change is beyond your control.  Most things in this world are, a priori, beyond your control.  But: if you are ‚Äúon the march‚Äù - you are focused in the right direction, it is leading your team forward, regardless of uncertainty, chaos and confusion! ‚ÄùJim Collins </blockquote><br>  <i>And indeed it is.</i>  <i>For myself, I put it a little differently: do what you must, and come what may.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>And all the members of our team follow this rule, fulfilling their tasks, regardless of many external factors.</i>  <i>Of course, we are all human, but the attitude to go ahead helps a lot.</i>  <i>Yes, we are mistaken, but we believe that it is more correct to understand the error, to quickly restructure and move on, albeit in a slightly different direction, but not stand still, lamenting the incorrectness of actions taken earlier.</i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">We must take care of ourselves</font> </h2><br>  What does the well-known instruction for passengers on airplanes say? <br><br>  <font color="#0071c5">‚ÄúPlease put an oxygen mask on yourself before assisting others.‚Äù</font> <br><br>  Absolutely true: if we are not able to take care of our own health and well-being, how can we build a society in which everyone should be healthy and provided for? <br><br>  Improper diet, lack of sleep and a sedentary lifestyle have a negative impact on: <br><ul><li>  energy level; </li><li>  ability to concentrate; </li><li>  the ability to manage emotions. </li></ul><br>  Even knowing this, the majority of responsible employees continue to ignore the needs of their bodies.  The basic ideas of a healthy lifestyle should also be included in your daily 20-mile march. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">We must constantly learn</font> </h2><br>  Our world is changing with unimaginable speed.  What is left for us to keep up with the times?  Right!  Constantly monitor these changes, <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/top-10-sovetov-i-instrumentov-dlya-izucheniya-inostrannogo-yazyka/">learn</a> something new. <br><br>  Do you know what the main common disadvantage of most top managers is?  They read little.  They are experts in their field, but the world does not only revolve around the axis of their business. <br>  Make it a rule to read at least 30 minutes a day (this can be audiobooks). <br><br>  <i>I try to follow this advice, in fact, this article came across for this very reason.</i>  <i>Indeed, the outlook is expanding and stereotypical stereotypical thinking simply does not have time to be formed, because a multitude of opinions, facts, and life experience comes into view.</i>  <i>Why stay in the blinders?</i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Components of a daily 20-mile march</font> </h2><br>  Our daily march consists of two main components: the morning and evening. <br><br>  <font color="#0071c5">Morning</font> <br>  In the morning we need to focus and orient ourselves on making the right decisions and making the right choice. <br><ul><li>  What is my mission / goal? </li><li>  What matters most today? </li><li>  What should I be grateful for today? </li><li>  What morning habits set me up for success? </li></ul><br>  <font color="#0071c5">End of the day</font> <br>  In the evening, we focus on the results of the day - what we did, what decisions we took, what opportunities we discovered. <br><ul><li>  What successes have I achieved today? </li><li>  What is new learned / learned?  How will I develop further? </li><li>  Who am I on the way?  Who do i need </li><li>  What evening habits will help me to relax, sleep well and prepare for the next day? </li></ul><br>  Even if it seems to you that the morning component is more important, <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/vosem-veshhej-kotorye-kazhdyj-chelovek-dolzhen-sdelat-posle-8-vechera/">do not ignore the evening rules</a> - without following them you will lead your team to stagnation. <br><br>  And we follow this rule too!  True, changing it a bit given the fact that the team is scattered in different cities and countries. <br><br>  The author of the translation is Vyacheslav Davidenko, the founder of the <a href="http://testutor.com/">TESTutor</a> company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297320/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297320/</a></p>
