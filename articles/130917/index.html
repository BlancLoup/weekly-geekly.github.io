    <a name="habracut"></a>  I will ask a rhetorical question: why, after all, do we not use dual-core processors today?  And try to answer.  You are the first they are much more expensive.  Secondly, Android 3. * It is optimized for Tegru 2 and the code has not been opened to it.  While there were talks about two cores, 4 cores and Android 4 appeared. In addition, the market for ARM processors is very fragmented.  Who can afford the release of multi-core devices?  - large manufacturers, who pull a large amount of software behind them - Nvidia, ASUS, etc.  We simply do not fit into this niche, since we cannot refine the software for each model and for each processor, which means we will always lag behind the A-brands.  Everything that we do, we think through.  We can explain why we do it, how to use it and how it works.  We went the other way.  We turned to the processors on the architecture at 86. The ‚Äútablets‚Äù as such were introduced and invented by Intel.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa mobile processor is the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãIntel.  But Atom processors are energy intensive and, until recently, could not compete with ARM processors in terms of battery life.  Of course, it (architecture 86) was more productive, but its gluttony reduced its merits to zero. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/313/b51/742/313b51742f99c971255fb574b2bf7915.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But starting with the Z600 series processors, which doesn‚Äôt have a cooler, it‚Äôs not noisy, it has passive cooling, and, most importantly, it doesn‚Äôt break down so much.  Second: it works up to 8 hours on Windows, up to 17 hours on Android, and on MeGoo, it works 18 hours (according to Intel).  This is more than enough today.  Now announced processors that will work for three days without shutdown.  But - back to the ground. <br><br>  For example.  We produce the Raccoon tablet models of the 163rd and 153rd - they are now very soon come to the shelves of online stores.  These models are based on Intel's Z670 processor.  Its big plus is the architecture at 86. The memory used in laptops and netbooks is quietly becoming in these models - up to 2 GB of standard DDR memory.  Next - SSD NAND-memory, the same flash drives as on netbooks, you can put up to 128 GB.  For a person using this model, this is a definite perspective. <br><br>  The third and most important thing is not RISC architecture.  What does this give?  The ability to install simultaneously 2 (and more OS) For example, your favorite Android and not loved by anyone, but so familiar and so necessary Windu.  Plus, the Z600 series processors have a built-in graphics co-processor (it has a graphics core).  Good enough for 3D graphics, for HDMI, and for everything else. What is more than enough for any tablet that assumes a universal usage model. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/04c/d70/b79/04cd70b79926d02644b20d113a250401.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This means that our ‚Äútablet‚Äù quietly installs Windows 7 without any problems and special work.  And he quietly works there, while we put Android on it.  If a person is accustomed to and wants to be fast for mobile use, he can use Android, and as a second operating system for standard applications, you can use Windows.  We also have experience installing Ubuntu and there is a video on how this is done.  There is developed by Intel MeeGo - also one of the Linux systems.  This is my assumption that if you wish, you can safely put FreeBSD or MacOS X there. But this still needs to be tested by practical consideration. <br><br>  <i>Versatility</i> <br>  I am sure that this is a universal platform for 86. It will work quickly, efficiently, and almost everything we have, all the applications that have been developed throughout the history of this business, will work on these tablets - 1C Accounting, standard applications.  Tablets are coming, coming as a replacement for the PDA, as a replacement for a netbook, as a replacement for a laptop.  And we believe that in a certain sector, in studies, in work, it occupies a very good part of the segment.  All these applications need to be rewritten on Tegra, just so they will not work there.  Here - will be. <br><br>  <i>Again, I risk running into it, but I‚Äôll still say: the tablets are the future.</i>  <i>But also for the android too.</i>  <i>In a word, tablets + android = our everything.</i> <br><br><hr><br>  <a href="http://www.service.muk.ua/">MUK-Service - all types of IT repair: warranty, non-warranty repair, sale of spare parts, contract service</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130917/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130917/</a></p>
