However, remember if we needed it 20 years ago, when we sat all day long behind Dune, Contra, Mortal Combat, Prince of Persia, Chip &amp; Dale, Duck Hunt and, of course, Super Mario?  Now these games may seem primitive, but for true connoisseurs, they will forever remain legendary.  Legendary for the reason that all such games had, if you will, your soul.  Which lived in those same consoles and cartridges. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/72e/390/bc8/72e390bc80f84e86b4865ffcb242b585.gif"><br><br>  Now on the Internet you can find a bunch of emulators that allow you to run old-school console games on modern computers, but hardly at least one of these simulators will allow you to return the same feelings that we experienced sitting in front of Segami, S√ºbar, Dandy, Atari and Nintendo.  Why?  Because the soul of these games lived in consoles.  But, as it turned out, the process of resurrection of the souls of classic consoles is not so complicated.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  If you want to relive those feelings that you experienced several decades ago, then you have a direct route to eBay.  Surprisingly, you can still find vintage 8- and 16-bit consoles there.  But "vintage" - not necessarily finished off and killed.  If you carefully climb through the lots, there you can find both used copies that have been preserved in perfect condition, as well as completely new models that are compatible with the very classic cartridges of yellow, gray and black colors that many still have far shelves cabinets. <br><br>  Here are some examples of what we were able to find. <br><br>  <b>Magnavox Odyssey 2 - 1978</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b01/cde/c60/b01cdec60ac9428782dc974a7347a2e7.jpg"><br><br>  Let's not climb into the jungle of the industry, and start with the second generation of the console, which at one time became a pioneer in the world of television set-top boxes.  Magnavox Odyssey 2 was released six years after the original - in 1978 - and is one of the few consoles with an integrated keyboard.  Vintage Odyssey 2 is unlikely to impress your children, but the masterpiece titles for it are worth spending at least a few hours behind them. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html%3F_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2047675.m570.l1313.TR4.TRC1.A0.H0.XMagnavox%2BOdyssey%2B2%26_nkw%3DMagnavox%2BOdyssey%2B2%26_sacat%3D0">MAGNAVOX Odyssey 2</a> can be found on eBay at prices ranging from $ 60 to $ 140.  With respect to other classic consoles, this is not so cheap, but it is worth understanding that this is a living legend, which is becoming more expensive every year. <br><br>  <b>Atari 7800 - 1986</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/015/47c/bbc/01547cbbc67b4e15b096898921f6b915.gif"><br><br>  Atari is an icon not only in the area of ‚Äã‚Äã"consolidation", but also gamedev.  However, at the moment we will touch on one of its most successful hardware products.  We are talking about the Atari 7800 gaming console, which was released back in 1986 (whatever one may say, and she will soon have thirty years old!).  Yes, many people remember both the Atari 2600 and the Atari 5200, but it was the 7800 that had the largest library of 2D games.  So, it was possible to run on it not only the then classics like Joust and Q * Bert, but also the modern for that day Alien Brigade and Midnight Mutants.  But is it worth it for music lovers to talk about these fond memories when 2015 is on the threshold?  I think it is worth it: after all, the Atari 7800 is not the ex-girlfriend, which cannot be returned.  Atari 7800 is the first, best and most loyal friend of any gamer who can still be found on eBay in any suitable configuration. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html%3F_odkw%3DAtari%2B7800%2B%25E2%2580%2594%2B1986%26_from%3DR40%257CR40%26_osacat%3D0%26_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2045573.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.XAtari%2B7800%26_nkw%3DAtari%2B7800%26_sacat%3D0">Atari 7800</a> ~ $ 30-60 <br><br>  <b>Super Nintendo (1991)</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/900/368/497/9003684979fd44e686624e63d67af1aa.gif"><br><br>  It is not enough to say that Super Nintendo was in the early and mid-90s the object of dreams of any teenager.  This console has become the benchmark for many other consoles, which were created in the likeness of this compact, but powerful device for its time.  And games like ‚ÄúThe Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past‚Äù, ‚ÄúStar Fox‚Äù and ‚ÄúMario Kart‚Äù are unlikely to disappear even when our only concern is caring for our grandchildren. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html%3F_odkw%3DColecovision%2BFlashback%26_from%3DR40%257CR40%257CR40%257CR40%257CR40%257CR40%257CR40%26_osacat%3D0%26_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2045573.m570.l1313.TR10.TRC1.A0.H0.XSuper%2BNintendo%26_nkw%3DSuper%2BNintendo%26_sacat%3D0">Super Nintendo</a> ~ $ 50-70 <br><br>  <b>Sega Dreamcast (1999)</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/75c/a4c/ef5/75ca4cef5ce6495099992ccfd30f0dd9.gif"><br><br>  About the game console Sega Dreamcast at one time did not hear, probably, only retirees.  And even though the console had a short life, it literally ahead of its time.  Judge for yourself: in 1999, Dreamcast supported online games and provided an enviable picture for that time in 3D games.  And that was before such giants as the Sony PS2, Microsoft Xbox and Nintendo GameCube appeared on the market.  Dreamcast controllers were equipped with separate screens and unique VMU memory cards, which allowed the user to play mini-games with their help.  And when you start to remember such hits as "Shenmue", "Crazy Taxi" and "Sonic Adventure", you realize that they will still be able to give players a lot of fun. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html%3F_odkw%3DSuper%2BNintendo%26_from%3DR40%257CR40%257CR40%257CR40%26_osacat%3D0%26_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2045573.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.X%2BSega%2BDreamcast%26_nkw%3D%2BSega%2BDreamcast%26_sacat%3D0">Sega Dreamcast</a> ~ $ 30-60. <br><br>  <b>Colecovision Flashback</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/784/24d/a0b/78424da0b32347a08f0da88915140083.jpg"><br><br>  If there are no game cartridges left in your hiding places, and you do not want to perplex yourself by searching and buying them, then in eBay open spaces there are many modern variations of vintage consoles.  Their difference is that these are not second-hand options from ‚Äúthose same years‚Äù, but new consoles, for which dozens of titles are pre-loaded. <br><br>  For example, Colecovision Flashback is a modern interpretation of the Colecovision console, released in 1982.  Then it received wide popularity due to the fact that games from slot machines were ported to it.  And now you can buy it in a set immediately with 60 titles. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html%3F_odkw%3DAtari%2B7800%26_from%3DR40%257CR40%257CR40%257CR40%257CR40%257CR40%26_osacat%3D0%26_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2045573.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.XColecovision%2BFlashback%26_nkw%3DColecovision%2BFlashback%26_sacat%3D0">Colecovision Flashback</a> ~ $ 50-70 <br><br>  <i>Now how this device to deliver and not to be ruined</i> . <br><br>  The average weight of the console is 2-3 kg.  Delivery, which is offered by sellers on eBay, will cost you $ 50-60.  And our delivery <a href="https://ru.litemf.com/">LiteMF-Express</a> - only $ 30-40.  It will be courier delivery and we are not going to collect the missing 30 bucks with all sorts of hidden additional payments.  Mail Forwarding service is free. <br><br>  We also have a weight gradation of 100 grams to 1 kg, which is very convenient for light packages. <br><br>  If you buy on eBay, you can link your eBay account to LiteMF and the system will automatically add the purchased items to the expected ones. <br><br>  Thank you for your attention and play the old games! <br><br> <a href="http://litemf.com/ru/price"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/73c/16f/590/73c16f59056a41469dce57f8d06f3150.jpg"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362809/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362809/</a></p>
