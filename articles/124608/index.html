  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Layouts, search for alternatives or why YSTUKEN will remain popular</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The keyboard becomes a frequent stumbling block in the life of a person somehow connected with a computer.  It is considered that the modern keyboard layout, which is the direct heir to the typewriter layouts, is ineffective for various reasons. <br>  The race began with the advent of electric typewriters, the reader remembers <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/124069/">trying Dvorak</a> .  Here I want to talk about attempts to improve the Russian keyboard layout, as well as explain why I call all alternatives "attempts." <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Layout </h4><br>  Scholes, the inventor of the first more or less sane typewriter, arranged the letters and numbers in alphabetical order in two rows. <br> <code>- 3 5 7 9 NOPQRSTUVWXYZ <br> 2 4 6 8 . ABCDEFGHIJKLM</code> <br>  The disadvantage of this step was expressed almost immediately: when printing, the levers clung to each other, and even two rows were too small and wide for hands.  The new three-row solution looked like this: <br> <code>AEIYUO <br> BCDFGHJKLM <br> ZXWVTSRQPN</code> <br>  This is still not familiar to us QWERTY, alphabetic order can be traced.  Next, an attempt was made to a four-row keyboard layout: <br> <code>2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ‚Äî , ' | <br> QWE . TYIUO - <br> ASDFGHJKLM <br> &amp; ZCXVBN ? : RP</code> <br>  Note the difference in the position of the keys R and P from the modern version.  Finally, a year later, in 1873, the keyboard acquired its familiar form to this day. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2e4/914/fe4/2e4914fe4d6370107914af832fea8768.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  YZUKEN </h4><br>  The strongest argument of the opponents of this keyboard layout: it was created in the United States in the nineteenth century, depending on the imagination of the opponents, even the whole masonry lodge was engaged in its development.  Before the Revolution, it had the appearance of YIUKEN and was called ‚ÄúStandard Keyboard‚Äù, as, for example, <a href="http://n-t.ru/tp/it/pm.htm">Mendeleev writes</a> .  The layout does not have the letter "", the numbers 0, 1 and 3, the latter is easy to get through the capital letter "Z".  The semicolon is also useless; it is put with a combination of a dot and a comma.  For minor changes, the layout has been preserved to this day. <br>  "YTSUKEN" became the basis for national layouts: Ukrainian, Tatar, Bashkir and so on.  Possessing a keyboard with the ‚ÄúYTSUKEN‚Äù layout, one can practically without any problems type the text of almost any language of the space of the former USSR, the base of which is Cyrillic: it‚Äôs enough to keep in mind only a few differences for the set of national characters. <br>  There is a typewritten computer keyboard layout; we will consider it a subset of the usual one.  It does not differ in the arrangement of letters (there is no ‚Äú‚Äù, perhaps), just the fourth digital row carries the functionality of punctuation marks, and the numbers are dialed with the cipher pressed - after all, numbers in the text are less common than punctuation marks.  In Wyndous, it is called "Russian (Typewriter)" and is pre-installed by default. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/766/a78/9eb/766a789eb2a7bf3e024bbf0602d53d87.png" alt="image"><br>  For people studying Russian as an additional language, there are phonetic layouts of YAVERT, YAZHERTI, in the USSR JCUKEN existed for the reverse situation. <br>  Criticism classics - a popular topic.  See how the little finger of the right hand is tired relative to the little finger of the left;  think, because the main work is done by the index fingers - the power of the blows is higher, which again gives away a typewritten past, which has also taken far ‚Äúyo‚Äù.  Medium, the main row is weak, the load increases.  Due to the fact that we use Western computer keyboards, which are designed for 28 Latin letters against the breadth of the Russian soul for 33, there are no many quotes, any Christmas trees and other interesting characters, you have to put a comma in two keys;  no one in the world has produced or assembled keyboards that take into account the length of the Russian alphabet.  "Pron", "porn" are recruited almost with one finger - inconvenient after all, eh? <br>  On the other hand, one should not be afraid of the American past, the primacy of the invention and the start of mass production of typewriters belongs to the United States, so it is not surprising that the layout is from there.  Additional symbols under Windous and Mack are easy to get by <a href="http://ilyabirman.ru/projects/typography-layout/">Ilya Birman's</a> remarkable and widely known <a href="http://ilyabirman.ru/projects/typography-layout/">Typographical Layout</a> . <br>  But there is nothing to be done about the fact that many characters are spaced apart to slow down printing.  They only did it not as an insidious Zionist conspiracy, but in order that the typewriter's hammers had time to go back. <br><br><h4>  Even faster </h4><br>  As already mentioned, in the 1930s, with the advent of electric typewriters, Dvorak Augustus was concerned about creating an improved layout, a fact well known. <br>  In the 2006th year, a certain Coleman perfected his developments in the framework of computer realities and called it ‚ÄúColemak‚Äù (‚ÄúColemak‚Äù).  As you can see, it even looks a bit like a regular QWERTY. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/131/e7f/8c2/131e7f8c2a2bbf3e723c6bb23011aba6.png" alt="image"><br>  The Soviet man clearly knew what he needed from life, performed the five-year plan at four years, honored the GOST and was not engaged in experiments with the Russian layout.

But hands while typing alternate.  Wisely located point and comma. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/596/0fb/bb1/5960fbbb14dc68ead5914e38de7bceb3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The official site is not functioning. <br><br><h4>  Zubachev layout </h4><br>  In 2007, a certain Dmitry Zubachev <a href="http://www.urikor.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php%3Fp%3D15801">created</a> his keyboard layout.  The project died out already in the 2008th year.  In essence, this attempt is the most famous of the smaller ones, there are many more similar ones, but they did not receive such a response. <br>  Currently, the site layout does not work. <br><br><h4>  So is it worth it? </h4><br>  The author of this article is an opponent of all <a href="http://lingvoforum.net/index.php%3Ftopic%3D23698.0">Protasov</a> <a href="http://narod.ru/disk/23379304000/protasov.rar.html">inventions</a> .  We bring in the forehead all the advantages and disadvantages. <br>  Pros: <br><ul><li>  Promised faster typing and comfort for the hands. </li></ul><br>  This is all serious.  Is it worth it?  I can give a lot of minuses: <br><ul><li>  It is necessary to change the standard system settings. </li><li>  The alternative is poorly supported by software and hardware manufacturers; you will always have to change settings frequently. </li><li>  In the process of learning you will need a keyboard with a non-standard layout.  But you can not search - I could not find it, and if there is something similar, it will be more expensive than a regular keyboard for eight dollars.  The richness of choice of multimedia keyboards is lost. </li><li>  The simplest solution is to order or buy a set of stickers for keys and stick them in the correct order, but this is again a specific operation. </li><li>  Keyboard layout is like walking.  You will have to relearn "walk" like a one-year-old child.  This may take several months. </li><li>  Retraining back to YTsUKEN or another alternative will also take several months. </li><li>  Without a native car with these settings, you will be left without hands.  The student will need his own keyboard at work with the desired order of stickers.  Yes, you can keep a cheat sheet on hand, but this is inefficient, and the standard JCUKEN will be confusing. </li><li>  You have no need to retrain to another layout, which is 8% more efficient if the level of typed text is limited to a post in Tumbler or Twitter. </li><li>  Layouts of Dvorak and Koulmak use, according to various estimates, about 2% of those typing in the Latin layout.  We never dreamed of this, the number of ‚Äúalternatives‚Äù is extremely small, the sites of alternative layouts do not function. </li><li>  This deviation from the standard with all the ensuing consequences, the problems are not obvious, but may arise. </li><li>  All the tests are informal.  Tests show an increase of 5-20%.  This is very small compared to the effort expended; during this time, it was possible to repetition the course YZUKEN several times, which would give a much more tangible increase. </li><li>  Finding the optimal layout is time consuming and requires physiological research.  The difference between normal and ‚Äúideal‚Äù will never be higher than a few percent.  The authors of alternatives do not publish almost any argument of their research.  Creating an ideal is impossible, the search for the best will never stop.  Will you change to a new, improved by 0.2% each time? </li></ul><br>  I would not mind improving what I am typing now, let the manufacturers release a Russian keyboard with more keys.  The best Russian layout is waiting for its inventor, but at the moment the alternative ones have not received any fame. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124608/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124608/</a></p>
