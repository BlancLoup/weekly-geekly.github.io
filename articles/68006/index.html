    <br>  <b>PHP 5.3 headline news everyone talks about</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Johannes schluter</b> <b><br></b> <br>  The main PHP 5.3 news that everyone is talking about is the namespaces and closures.  However, in PHP 5.3 there are a lot of other new functions that make this release a significant milestone in the history of the project: Intl, Phar, mysqlnd modules, improvements in SPL, late static binding (late static binding) and much more. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Johannes works in the MySQL client library development team, the creators of the world's most popular open source database, and is studying at the University of Applied Sciences Munich.  He is the release manager of the PHP 5.3 branch and a frequent speaker at various conferences around the world. <br><br>  <b>Presentation of "MySQL [Online] Backup"</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Starting with version 5.4.x, MySQL users will have access to a new, fast MySQL [Online] Backup. <br><br>  You can backup / restore very quickly <br>  No locks - you can use your tables during backup <br>  There is no need to postpone backup until the time of minimal activity. <br><br>  The presentation will show the test results. <br>  A separate block will be devoted to comparison with existing technicians, in particular, whether it is worthwhile to abandon the solutions used in favor of the new opportunity. <br><br>  <b>Sphinx 2009 - by author</b> <b><br></b> <br>  In the incomplete year 2009, we have made many different new features.
