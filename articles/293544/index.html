      Delivery Hero, the online food delivery platform in Berlin, rightfully ranks first on the list, raising a whopping $ 523 million investment in the past year alone.  We should note that we deliberately did not include Rocket Internet in the list presented below, even though the company sold a fairly large part of the block of shares on the eve of their October initial public offering on the stock exchange ( <a href="http://tech.eu/brief/rocket-internet-shares-no-pop-ipo/">IPO</a> ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc6/5d8/aa0/dc65d8aa061f4b23bc8deef688a0cef6.png" width="700"><br><br><h4>  Brief analysis </h4><br>  The graph above shows that in 2014 three European companies in the amount attracted more than a billion dollars of financing (and one of them accounts for more than half of this amount).  We also see that last year at least twelve companies received more than $ 100 million of investments.  Thirteen, if you include Westwing, which came close to this bar, raising $ 96.5 million.  Eighteen companies received more than $ 75 million. <br><br>  It is worth noting that trading platforms and projects involved in e-commerce remain popular: more than half of the companies in the list can be attributed to these categories.  Three companies in the list deal exclusively with online orders and food delivery, including the already named numero uno (Delivery Hero, Takeaway.com and Foodpanda). <br><br>  Other popular areas of activity are payment systems and financial technologies (Adyen, Klarna and Borro), as well as software development (Scytl, ironSource, Blue Yonder and ElasticSearch). <br><br><h4>  Geography of the largest rounds of funding in 2014 </h4><br>  Of the five largest rounds of funding in 2014, three occurred in Germany (it should be noted that two of them are connected with Berlin-based Rocket Internet companies targeting the emerging markets of Southeast Asia and Africa), one in the Netherlands, and one in Russia. <br><br>  If you look at the top 20 main fundraising campaigns of 2014, you can see that Germany ranks first in the number of companies in the list (six pieces), followed by the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, from which there are three companies in the list.  The Scandinavian countries also showed themselves, given that the list includes two Swedish and two Danish companies (surprisingly, there is not a single Finnish company).  Spain, Israel, Russia and France have one company on the list. <br><br>  Below is a detailed list of the twenty largest rounds of funding for European technology companies in 2014: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0df/15e/8bb/0df15e8bb17746f7a37235490e935b97.png" width="700"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.deliveryhero.com/">Delivery Hero</a> (Germany) in total attracted $ 523 million for three rounds held in 2014 ($ 88 million in January, $ 85 million in April and a whopping $ 350 million in September).  Founded in May 2011, Delivery Hero wants to capture the increasingly popular area of ‚Äã‚Äãonline food orders.  Today, the company has raised $ 635 million, and will direct these funds to strengthen its influence around the world. <br><br>  Of course, the rapid spread throughout the world is costly.  In the face of strong and ever-growing competition in the field of online food orders, marketing costs are quite high.  Hence the cash infusion. <br><br>  But $ 635 million in less than 4 years?  What do their investors know, and why don't we? <br><br>  <i>Investors:</i> Vostok Nafta, Insight Venture Partners, Phenomen Ventures, Team Europe, Kite Ventures, Ru-net, Tengelmann Ventures, Holtzbrinck Ventures and Point Nine Capital. <br><br clear="all"><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/213/b42/d5e/213b42d5ebad4da5a4faf02ab66b729e.png" width="700"><br><br>  <a href="https://www.adyen.com/home/">Adyen</a> (Netherlands) raised $ 250 million.  A start-up dealing with international payments benefits from its rapid growth: over the past year, the company located in Amsterdam doubled the number of payments processed and its profit. <br><br>  Adyen has created a platform that allows companies to accept payments from all over the world.  The company has entered into partnership agreements with all major credit card companies, as well as with local payment systems around the world.  Adyen needs money to start working in all parts of the world and gain an advantage over a large number of emerging competing companies. <br><br>  <i>Investors</i> : General Atlantic, Index Ventures, Felicis Ventures and Temasek Holdings. <br><br clear="all"><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f67/496/75a/f6749675af464854b3bfb12d96f346a1.png" width="700"><br><br>  <a href="http://lazada.com/">Lazada</a> (Germany) raised $ 250 million.  Despite its astounding growth, the e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia is still at an early stage.  The retail giant Lazada needs money to hold and consolidate its leading position in key markets (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam). <br><br>  The company reports that since June 2014, sales, or rather gross revenues (GMV), have doubled from products sold through a website or mobile app. <br><br>  <i>Investors:</i> Temasek, Rocket Internet, Verlinvest, Kinnevik, Tesco, Tengelmann Ventures, Summit Partners and Access Industries. <br><br clear="all"><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d5/f01/5c0/5d5f015c0c8c426792613a2e33497bd5.jpeg" width="700"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/">Ozon</a> (Russia): $ 150 million.  Ozon Group CEO Ma√´lle Gavet said in an interview that capital will be used to accelerate the growth of the company.  And how is an online store of this size like Ozon going to do this? <br><br>  Of course, investing in logistics infrastructure (storage, reception points, and so on), expanding the range and increasing the speed of delivery, while reducing prices.  We can say with confidence that this requires substantial cash. <br><br>  <i>Investors:</i> Sistema and the telecommunications company MTS controlled by it. <br><br clear="all"><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/299/0ce/34d/2990ce34dde945d49992059105b348a6.png" width="700"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.jumia.com/">Jumia</a> / Africa eCommerce Holding (Germany) raised $ 150 million.  Jumia, headquartered in Berlin, is an online store representing a large number of product categories: from clothing to electronics, in Africa.  1500 employees work in ten different countries. <br><br>  As part of the Africa Internet Group, the leading Internet group in Africa, Jumia prides itself on its own logistics infrastructure and fleet of vehicles.  The growth of an online store with a large number of "offline" items (as is the case with Ozon and Lazada) costs a lot of money - hence the amount of funding. <br><br>  <i>Investors:</i> Summit Partners, Rocket Internet, Millicom and Africa Internet Group (AIG). <br><br clear="all"><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/704/2e5/22c/7042e522c1b148a1a993110f60558d5f.png" width="700"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.kobaltmusic.com/">Kobalt Music Group</a> (UK): $ 140 million.  Kobalt collects license fees on behalf of 2,000 famous personalities and companies, such as Paul McCartney, Disney, Dr.  Luke, Max Martin, Dave Grohl, Maroon 5 and Skrillex. <br><br>  Kobalt began to take steps towards the independent creation of intellectual property, for which it receives royalties.  Today, Kobalt enforces copyright on over 600,000 songs.  To make this number even higher, the company needs substantial investments. <br><br>  <i>Investors:</i> Balderton Capital and Michael Dell's private investment firm MSD Capital. <br><br clear="all"><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae6/c8c/a0a/ae6c8ca0a698406188a630634c8a7dc0.png" width="700"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.momondogroup.com/">Momondo Group</a> (Denmark) raised $ 130 million.  Momondo Group (based in Denmark, but located in the UK), being the ancestor of travel sites with online booking Cheapflights and Momondo, has recently been looking for a buyer. <br><br>  Last October, the company received $ 130 million from the Boston-based Great Hill Partners investment fund.  After raising funds, Momondo is estimated at $ 210 million.  The company plans to make several transactions with the money received in order to continue its development. <br><br>  <i>Investors:</i> Great Hill Partners. <br><br clear="all"><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/243/195/354/2431953543b948ada4bda40a15abc199.png" width="700"><br><br>  <a href="https://klarna.com/%3Flang%3Den">Klarna</a> (Sweden): $ 120.5 million.  Headquartered in Stockholm, Klarna allows thousands of online stores to accept payments from millions of customers across Europe. <br><br>  Excluding banks as intermediaries from the payment chain is an expensive enterprise.  Klarna also needs extra financing in order to pay for the acquisition of the German SOFORT system and move to new offices in Stockholm. <br><br>  <i>Investors:</i> Sequoia Capital, General Atlantic and Atomico. <br><br clear="all"><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/393/6b3/884/3936b3884bc843d8907ea33b04b100c3.png" width="700"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.borro.com/">Borro</a> (UK): $ 112 million.  Borro is an online platform that allows people to take money as collateral for expensive watches and other luxury items. <br><br>  Borro CEO Paul Aitken (Paul Aitken) told TechCrunch that the money raised will go to expanding business in the UK and the United States, as well as increasing the amount of cash loans Borro can provide. <br><br>  <i>Investors:</i> Victory Park Capital, Canaan Partners, Eden Ventures, European Founders Fund, Augmentum and Ribbit Capital. <br><br clear="all"><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/776/e11/da8/776e11da862d44e7a741471b2e27afc2.png" width="700"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.scytl.com/en/">Scytl</a> (Spain) on the results of three tranches of round C attracted a total of $ 104 million.  Headquartered in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãScytl is the global leader in secure online voting and election process upgrades, with a huge number of patents in this area. <br><br>  Scytl claims that its solutions have been successfully used in more than 35 countries around the world over the past 10 years, but there are an even greater number of countries that can appreciate modern and safe technologies for modernizing the electoral process.  Fresh investments should contribute to the further development of the company. <br><br>  <i>Investors:</i> Vy Capital, Adams Street Partners, Industry Ventures, Vulcan Capital Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and SAP Ventures. <br><br clear="all"><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e0/322/c9f/1e0322c9fb8448e593c6d4d5a05917f0.png" width="700"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.takeaway.com/">Takeaway.com</a> (Netherlands): $ 103 million.  As in the case of Delivery Hero (see above), Takeaway.com wants to spread its food delivery service around the world, and this requires investment in staff, offices and advertising. <br><br>  Another reason for such a profitable round of Takeaway.com was its acquisition of the site Lieferando.de, one of the largest food delivery services in Germany. <br><br>  <i>Investors:</i> Macquarie Capital and Prime Ventures. <br><br clear="all"><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99f/313/a14/99f313a142e34594882fd262ea05dbe3.png" width="700"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.blablacar.com/">BlaBlaCar</a> (France): $ 100 million.  The BlaBlaCar service allows travelers to search for travel companions on cars, providing them with cell phone numbers or e-mail drivers, to resolve issues of cost of travel. <br><br>  The car rental and joint travel markets in Europe (and not only) are quickly filling up with heavily-funded competitors that threaten the BlaBlaCar business.  To stay ahead and start working in other countries: Turkey, Brazil and India, BlaBlaCar needs extra money in the account. <br><br>  <i>Investors:</i> Index Ventures, Accel Partners, the French ISAI Foundation and Lead Edge Capital. <br><br clear="all"><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/68e/888/127/68e8881270734ce3b787fe538bf9c7f5.png" width="700"><br><br>  <a href="https://www.westwing.de/">Westwing</a> (Germany): 72 million euros / approximately $ 96.4 million.  Westwing is an online store of interior items and d√©cor that requires a large amount of money to store goods, their distribution and marketing. <br><br>  Westwing is part of the Rocket Internet family and therefore has relatively easy access to the ‚Äúwallets‚Äù of wealthy investors - partners of the German incubator. <br><br>  <i>Investors:</i> Odey Asset Management, Fidelity Worldwide Investment and Tengelmann. <br><br clear="all"><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae3/c6c/b18/ae3c6cb1874344a59fd4e4cd2718a1a5.png" width="700"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.ironsrc.com/">ironSource</a> (Israel) raised $ 85 million.  The Tel Aviv-based company develops software and helps developers distribute and make money on their desktop and mobile applications.  About 450 people work in the company's offices located around the globe, and the company's annual earnings amount to about $ 250 million. <br><br>  This was their first financing (the sale of secondary shares with Carmel Ventures does not count), and the money will be spent on hiring employees, developing the product line and expanding the company to an international level. <br><br>  <i>Investors:</i> An unknown pool of strategic and institutional investors from America, Europe and China. <br><br clear="all"><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e76/30b/2f5/e7630b2f54c641009b2887bd1add0672.png" width="700"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.foodpanda.com/">Foodpanda</a> (Germany) raised $ 80 million in two rounds in 2014.  Because the companies of the Rocket Internet family working in the developing industries are well funded.  That's why.  As in the case of Delivery Hero and Takeaway.com (represented in this list), Foodpanda wants to spread its food delivery network around the world, and this requires investments in staff, offices and advertising. <br><br>  <i>Investors:</i> Rocket Internet, Falcon Edge Management, Phenomen Ventures and Kinnevik. <br><br clear="all"><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e84/522/c0b/e84522c0b4ff4db6ae0e44f903e40b5c.png" width="700"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.truecaller.com/">Truecaller</a> (Sweden) raised $ 78.8 million in two rounds.  Truecaller allows smartphone users to detect incoming calls and manage a list of contacts.  The service is used by about 85 million people around the globe, more than half of whom are in India.  Every day the number of Truecaller users increases by 200,000 people. <br><br>  The company first raised $ 18.8 million, and then another $ 60 million in order to stimulate further growth in the United States, India and Europe. <br><br>  <i>Investors:</i> Sequoia Capital, Atomico and Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers (KPCB). <br><br clear="all"><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/73f/a5d/efa/73fa5defaee84999bfdac0c43db41e60.png" width="700"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.blue-yonder.com/en/">Blue Yonder</a> (Germany) raised $ 75 million.  Blue Yonder, a company engaged in Big Data and founded in 2008 by nuclear physicist Michael Feindt, turned to Warburg Pincus, a New York based investment firm, to save $ 75 million to expand the company's influence in the global market. <br><br>  <i>Investors:</i> Warburg Pincus. <br><br clear="all"><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ec/c0a/e66/0ecc0ae66e3547e78df88bfda74bf644.png" width="700"><br><br>  <a href="http://tradeshift.com/">Tradeshift</a> (Denmark): $ 75 million.  Tradeshift offers software for B2B commerce and collaboration, and today unites 500,000 companies. <br><br>  To spread its influence to Asia, in particular, to Japan, Tradeshift needed a helping hand, which Scentan Ventures, a Singaporean venture capital firm, extended to them, and not only invested large sums, but also offered partnerships to help develop business in the region. <br><br>  <i>Note:</i> According to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Tradeshift could receive an additional $ 30 million, just by the time of publication the data was not confirmed.  It is likely that in 2014 the company attracted a total of $ 105 million. <br><br>  <i>Investors:</i> Scentan Ventures, Notion Capital, Ru-net, Kite Ventures, Intuit and PayPal. <br><br clear="all"><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/417/622/9d0/4176229d0342480fbc4f5eef32c3ebc5.png" width="700"><br><br>  ElasticSearch (Netherlands): $ 70 million.  Elasticsearch offers an advanced freeware search and analysis engine used by major companies like Facebook and The Guardian. <br><br>  To scale, they need additional capital, in particular, from investors with extensive experience working with open products and corporate software.  The money received will be spent on further development and commercial activities around the world. <br><br>  <i>Investors:</i> New Enterprise Associates (NEA), Benchmark Capital and Index Ventures. <br><br clear="all"><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e5/4d1/3f6/0e54d13f65f249e38ae24dd02f6b3984.png" width="700"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.farfetch.com/">FarFetch</a> (UK): $ 66 million.  FarFetch is an online store for independent fashion boutiques.  The company, whose headquarters is located in London, told TechCrunch that the investment will go towards international expansion in the United States, Brazil and Asia, as well as multi-channel marketing. <br><br>  <i>Investors:</i> Vitruvian Partners, Cond√© Nast International and Advent Ventures. <br><br>  Other notable rounds of funding announced this year were: SoundCloud (announced $ 60 million), Prezi ($ 57 million), Arago ($ 55 million), iZettle ($ 53.5 million), Huddle ($ 51 million), HelloFresh ($ 50 million ) and Moovit (also $ 50 million). <br><br>  <i>Note:</i> When the amount of funding was announced in euros, we converted this amount into US dollars at the current exchange rate. <br><br><hr><br> <a href="http://tceh.com/edu/invest/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a01/3ce/668/a013ce668bd641dc8430122b813cf287.jpg" width="300" align="left"></a>  <b><i>Announcement:</i></b> <br><br>  <i>From September 20, the FRIA Investment School will start ( <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/friifond/blog/16354/">more</a> ).</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Four evenings and two days of internship with the best investment team in the startup market that will give you annual access to FRIA projects ( <a href="http://tceh.com/edu/invest/">registration</a> ).</i> <i><br><br><br clear="all"></i> <hr></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293544/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293544/</a></p>
