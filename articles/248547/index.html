      In this situation, manufacturers rely on solutions that would bring real benefits to the customers' business and would not turn the IT department into one endless expensive article, but would make information systems a flexible and cost-effective basis for implementing cloud technologies and using mobile applications. <br><br>  As such a solution, HP offers a new, ninth generation of ProLiant servers.  New items have new productive processors, faster memory and more functional disk controllers.  The HP ProLiant Gen9 server line will provide IT infrastructure with state-of-the-art flexibility, energy efficiency, and additional information security. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf3/c33/d10/cf3c33d105dd40f8a0154dae36cc311c.jpg"><br><br>  The lineup of new HP servers has a very wide range.  It includes traditional rack and pedestal single-processor and dual-processor servers, powerful 4-processor rack systems, modular servers, models in a blade form factor, software-defined servers, a business-critical server system, scalable to 16 processors, and also based on them various specialized converged systems for databases, applications, virtualization, big data, the infrastructure of user workstations, etc. This diversity makes it possible to provide customers  KU is the optimal solution for problems of any scale and complexity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f2c/d81/3df/f2cd813df588473f84aa4d32f09805c6.jpg"><br><br>  <b>To each according to his needs</b> <br>  At the moment, HP has released eight dual-processor models of the new generation.  These are four rack-mount servers, two at the middle and senior levels, a pedestal server, a model in the blade form factor, and two servers of the new super-dense families for systems with air and water cooling. <br><br>  Rack servers of the senior level, DL360 Gen9 and DL380 Gen9 of 1U and 2U form factor, respectively, are universal systems for solving a wide range of tasks in the IT infrastructure of medium and large enterprises.  They are characterized by a combination of compact size, reasonable price and powerful stuffing.  They use older processors, including 160 W, a huge amount of memory (up to 1.5 TB), an integrated 4-port Gigabit controller and an additional FlexibleLOM slot for installing another network adapter with a bandwidth of up to 100 Gbit / s and above.  The installation of several professional graphic adapters or accelerators is also allowed, the possibility of using high-speed SSD drives of the form factor M.2 and new data carriers in the DARM bus - NVDIMM is allowed.  The single-unit model allows installation of 10 SFF or 4 LFF-disks with hot plug and up to three PCI Express devices, dual-unit - up to 27 SFF, 15 LFF and 6 PCIe, respectively.  In addition, the servers are equipped with redundant fault-tolerant power and cooling systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d1/3e4/219/6d13e42199b34ea592be177d503d9271.jpg"><br><h6>  <i>Servers of the senior level are completed with powerful processors and a huge amount of RAM for solving problems of almost any complexity.</i> </h6><br><br>  The ML350 Gen9 dual-processor senior-level server has excellent expansion capabilities.  In addition to supporting older processors and large amounts of memory, the model can accommodate up to 48 SFF or 24 LFF disks, which provides unprecedented performance for the disk subsystem of a traditional server.  It also provides up to nine PCI Express cards, four of which can be professional graphics adapters or accelerators.  The server power supply system can consist of four power supply units simultaneously, the cooling system has redundancy and hot-swap capabilities. <br><br>  Includes a new line and server blade - BL460c Gen9.  The blade server supports older processors and memory up to 1 TB, is equipped with a converged dual-port HP FlexFabric adapter with a capacity of 20 Gbps, and also supports work with new media formats M.2 and NVDIMM.  HP BladeSystem with a new generation of blades will be a great solution for efficient virtualization of server systems or the transition to a private cloud structure. <br><br>  In cases where the highest possible density of traditional air-cooled enterprise systems is needed, HP offers the Apollo 6000 System and the new XL230a Gen9 server.  The novelty surpasses traditional mid-range rack-mount dual-processor servers in its characteristics, but at the same time it has a much higher density and higher energy efficiency. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c83/851/981/c838519818724852856dd69733b46eda.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Optimizing energy costs</b> <br>  In order to obtain not only density, but also energy efficiency, when PUE tends to 1, which is unattainable today for traditional data centers, the new server generation HP Apollo 8000 specialized server solution with liquid cooling was introduced. Innovative technologies and servers used by HP ProLiant XL730f Gen9 made it possible to achieve a revolutionary level of density - up to 144 dual-processor servers in one cabinet, which is more than 4 thousand processor cores.  This, in turn, gives a fourfold increase in productivity per square meter and about 40% per watt compared to traditional air-cooled servers in a similar configuration.  It is also worth noting that the new system makes it possible to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by more than 3.5 thousand tons, which is comparable to the annual exhaust volume of eight hundred cars. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1b0/239/6cc/1b02396cc539431bb44158074f7b7639.jpg"><br><br>  Similar results were achieved thanks to a new cabinet power distribution system and water cooling system. <br>  The server cabinet is powered by a three-phase high-voltage AC voltage and has a one-stage system for rectifying and distributing DC power through the cabinet to consumer devices.  A significant reduction in the number of elements involved in the voltage conversion can significantly reduce operating costs, as well as the cost of installation work and maintenance of the system infrastructure in the data center room. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a8/037/964/3a803796468b465384596f16750cbca9.jpg"><br><h6>  <i>The HP Apollo 8000 Liquid-Cooled Server Solution provides an opportunity to achieve a revolutionary level of server density.</i> </h6><br>  A liquid cooling system involves the use of a dry contact solution in which signal and power circuits are reliably isolated from fluid flows.  The radiators of the server components are connected with all-metal heat pipes with a heat sink located on the side wall of the server housing.  The wall is in close contact with the cabinet heat exchanger, through which coolant circulates through closed channels. <br>  The HP Apollo 8000 uses a separate intelligent cooling distribution module that provides up to four server cabinets with XL700f servers and allows up to 320 kW of heat.  The main cooling cycle of IT equipment is separated from the secondary cycle, which allows to achieve constant water quality, and also provides control over pressure and flow rate. <br><br>  <b>Security questions</b> <br>  The new 9th generation ProLiant servers are equipped with a number of technologies and tools that allow you to better protect data from intruders in various areas of information processing, storage and transmission. <br><br>  One of these solutions, allowing you to ensure the confidentiality of data on servers and at the same time comply with regulations and standards - HP Secure Encryption.  It gives the opportunity to solve this problem with the help of encryption keys and provides convenient deployment. <br><br>  Secure Encryption is based on algorithms that are integrated into all HP Smart Array Px3x and Px4x server RAID controllers (for example, P431 and P441, respectively) and HP Smart HBA H24x adapters (for example, H244br in RAID mode).  The solution provides data encryption on any HP Smart Drive drives connected directly to these controllers - hard and solid-state, SAS and SATA.  Moreover, the data temporarily placed by the Smart Array controller in its cache memory is also subjected to encryption, which provides a high level of information protection. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f1a/a40/2a8/f1aa402a83884dcdb2ea6304cf160610.jpg"><br><br>  In the case of small companies, when you need to organize a simple and closed encryption solution, it is better to use the local key management mode.  To do this, you need to purchase an encryption license for each of the disks in the array that you want to protect. <br><br>  It is recommended that medium and large organizations build a unified system in the mode of remote encryption key management.  In this case, the hardware key manager of the HP Enterprise Secure Key Manager is required for servers and disk controllers.  ESKM is a dedicated device that can serve more than 25 thousand servers and process more than 2 million associated keys.  To ensure fault tolerance, it is recommended to use at least two ESKM, if necessary, their number in a distributed cluster can be increased to eight. <br><br>  One of the important aspects of using ESKM is a high level of security for network connections.  The devices are connected not to the organization‚Äôs production network, but to the management network, which includes only the management ports of the switches, storage systems and server iLO ports.  In fact, an attacker‚Äôs access to traffic with keys becomes physically impossible.  For the remote control mode, you need to purchase a key manager, a server license (supplied with each ESKM), a client license for each device you want to encrypt, and also an Integrated Lights Out Advanced or Scale Out license, if it was not previously purchased with the server, separately or as part of the HP Insight Control and HP OneView packages. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d23/b61/af4/d23b61af4a534175aba05289d426eca5.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Control center</b> <br>  For convenience and consistency in managing components within a converged infrastructure, HP offers the use of OneView software (www.hp.com/go/oneview), which completely transforms information system management processes.  The product provides an opportunity to solve a wide range of infrastructure lifecycle management tasks in both physical and virtual environments.  HP OneView unifies and simplifies server and storage resource management, as well as optimizes infrastructure configuration and monitoring.  Intuitive dashboards, notification system and powerful search tools allow you to perform complex operations to manage the efforts of just one specialist. <br><hr><br>  We distribute HP ProLiant Gen9 in Tajikistan.
