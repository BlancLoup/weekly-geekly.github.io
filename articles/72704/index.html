  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We diagnose a lie ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today I decided to write an article on the one hand not IT-ishny, on the other it concerns any person.  I think many of you are already hooked on the TV series "Theory of Lies", in this series all the events revolve around <strong>non-verbal communication</strong> .  On this topic, I was still hooked at school when my parents discovered the secret of how they determine that I am lying.  Non-verbal communication is not limited to one lie, it covers almost all the feelings and emotions of a person, it‚Äôs like bugs in the code for injects and hacks :) Men, as practice shows, recognize gestures and body signals better than women, it can and correctly, they have for this there is an intuition that covers the whole of the semi-mystical sciences, but now it is not about them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  All my observations are based on the works of such people as: Alan Pease, Henri Calero, Gerald Nirenberg.  There are moments that I have not found confirmation, there are moments that are not much do not correspond to the theory.  There are rows of communication signals that do not give an unambiguous answer, but they lead to certain thoughts for analysis.  From my own experience, I can say that it is not so difficult to define a lie, it is <b>much harder to understand the reasons, since each person pursues his own goal</b> , and sometimes just the subconscious requires intrigues from them!  Determine the cause of lies most importantly, because then you can understand the goals and intentions of a person ‚Äî you can correct them, but this applies more to such sciences as psychology, more precisely even to psychology of manipulation, but this requires too much knowledge about human behavior and experience , and life, which in my age is not so much for such knowledge. <br><br>  Naturally, I conducted my experiments on my friends and girls, as it is easier to analyze them, because we are practically from the same social stratum.  Yes, social position influences strongly the codes of verbal communication, since, for example, politicians practically all know how to correct their tone, intonation (paralinguistics), but almost all of them cannot hide the signs of the eyes (ocules) and facial expressions.  There are a lot of codes that betray false, but there are a number of common gestures that will be useful to adopt!  What attracts me to the sciences related to verbal communication is the fact that their people practically cannot hide, unlike psychology.  True, there is one thing that often makes it difficult to analyze - this is pressure!  Immediately make a reservation, I noticed on my own.  Often, business partners, bosses (in general, people who try or dominate you) resort to this trick, while trying to communicate they try to suppress you with their authority, which in turn leads to the fact that you transfer your resources not to analysis, but to protect yourself. <br><br>  There is one more main point when observing that the interlocutor should not be missed, this often happens when communicating with the weaker half, and therefore it was always the hardest for them :)

    <h2>  Covering mouth </h2><br>  I decided to start with this gesture, because for me it was at one time the key.  It was according to him that my parents in childhood determined that I was lying.  This gesture is not often suitable for formed individuals, but it will be useful for young parents, because with his son, this gesture began to observe quite often. <br>  For us, this gesture has another aspect that is more common in adults than in children.  If you are telling something and the interlocutor covers his mouth, then it says that he is almost sure that you are lying (or not taking it seriously) and the main thing is either to move out, even if you are not lying, or go to the issuance of some accurate data eg dates, amounts, etc.  If you do not do this, then most likely your discussion will lead to the fact that the interlocutor will never again trust and rely on you in this topic. <br><br>  In mature people, this gesture often happens, similar to sticking to the head, often all confused with interest! <br><br><h2>  Rubbing the tip of the nose </h2><br>  In almost all books and works on the interpretation of gestures, rubbing the tip of the nose is attributed to 100% lies.  As they say, I‚Äôm nobody to doubt the words of the greats, but I often notice from my friends that they make this gesture not when they lie, but when they think about what to lie, of course, there have been cases when they lied.  That is, I do not attribute this gesture to lies, but only to the appearance of a person‚Äôs desire to get away from an answer or to lie openly, after this gesture you may need to change the subject or if it is critical for you, find out the reason.  Better disease of communication, treat in the early stages, especially when it comes to loved ones.  And if it concerns colleagues, then fix this bug, otherwise you‚Äôll get yourself a partisan in the ranks or an outright enemy ... <br><br>  The first two gestures, many people know how to hide or use them for their own purposes, this again concerns the topic of manipulation.  But these two gestures are very effective in analyzing drunk people, as they are simple and not obstructed under the influence of alcohol. <br><br><h2>  Rubbing a century </h2><br>  This gesture <b>has weight when you answer your questions</b> .  Often, your interlocutor does not want to look you in the eye when he is cunning, but most people already know that hiding his eyes actually means: I lie, do not listen to my answer.  And here comes to the aid of the brain, which is trying to hide the view, hiding behind a logical explanation, they say, the eye was cleaned.  In women, by the way, this gesture looks quite ridiculous, every time I watched it, they make it slowly and carefully, which would probably not spoil the makeup. <br>  Why I wrote that this gesture has more weight during the answer to your questions, because often people, when they themselves begin to lie, they try to monitor the reaction of the interlocutor to monitor how the information is received by the interlocutor.  And as practice has shown, this gesture doesn‚Äôt mean anything to drunk people, probably the instinct of self-preservation works on the subconscious mind, which would not damage the eye :) <br><br><h2>  Scratching the neck </h2><br>  Scratching your neck, at the moment of perception of information, your interlocutor shows that he doubts the veracity of your words, but unlike covering your mouth, you can easily convince him of your honesty.  This gesture I have never noticed for women, but I am sure that it also occurs, they are probably more constrained by the movement when communicating, but often I noticed that they are twitching earrings. <br><br><h2>  Looking away </h2><br>  I would advise to <b>take this gesture into account only if you know your interlocutor well</b> .  Since the people with whom you just met, will make every effort to distance you from you.  And this gesture is perfectly able to hide almost all the leaders who do not care what you think. <br><br><h2>  Rubbing neck </h2><br>  In contrast to scratching the neck, rubbing often occurs with the whole palm and the head being thrown to the side.  If a person takes his head to the direction of the floor, then this often means that he is hiding something from his story, but if upwards, when a person promises and clearly does not really plan to do it or he has lost it.  By the way, if such a reaction, to the next order, from the boss, then it also means that he sent a boss about 200 times inside himself. <br><br><h2>  Crossing arms on chest </h2><br>  This gesture is not entirely a lie, but it is useful to control the situation when communicating.  If your interlocutor crosses his arms over his chest and at the same time <b>squeezes his fingers into a fist</b> , this means that a person is hostile to you or takes an ‚Äúoffensive‚Äù position on your topic.  In this situation, it helps me personally, to move out or jump over to another topic, preferably an approximate one, this will bring down the interlocutor, he will start to rejoice that you are not consistent and this will take a more favorable mood to your person.  True, in women, this gesture I observed only once, most likely it is again connected with the restriction of movements during communication. <br><br>  This is basically all common gestures that will help you understand what to expect from a person.  The main thing to remember is that <b>a person‚Äôs lies are accompanied by an internal conflict, so the easiest way to tell lies is inadequate or inappropriate changes in the gestures of the facial muscles</b> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72704/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72704/</a></p>
