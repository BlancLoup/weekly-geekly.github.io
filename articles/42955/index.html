  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Comfortable reading from a mobile or review txt to java converters</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A terrible thing happened!  My smartphone <a href="http://www.mobile-review.com/review/nokia-6110-navi.shtml">nokia navigator 6110</a> died suddenly!  I had to look for a replacement, and a good and inexpensive one, because where did an ordinary programmer have money for a good phone (a loud mournful sob).  In general, after a long search, the <a href="http://www.mobile-review.com/review/nokia-2630.shtml">nokia 2630</a> phone was chosen.  Actually, I just need a phone to call, write sms and read!  And basically just to read, because  I love to read.  On smarts, everything is quite simple, downloaded the book, translated it into txt format, threw it into smart with the installed qreader, and you enjoy it.  On ordinary phones, before you enjoy, you need to translate the book into a java application.  For these purposes, there are special programs converters from txt to java.  Well, actually I killed the last two days to make reading from my mobile convenient, and now I‚Äôll probably share with you my experience. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  How I tested. </h4><br>  But I‚Äôm not a picky person at all, all I need from a book is the ability to read it ... read with comfort, of course.  I know, you say that you can read only real paper books comfortably, but besides that I'm not picky, I'm also greedy, so I used to not buy books and download, depriving poor authors of the last piece of bread (without sarcasm) ... I generally I think that if the number of people like me will increase, then soon they will start advertising in the books ... <br>  So, what I need from the book: <br><ul><li>  Ability to change font size / color </li><li>  Ability to change the background color </li><li>  The ability to adjust the backlight time </li><li>  The ability to expand the book to full screen </li><li>  Status bar showing in which part of the book I am (preferably in percentage) and time </li><li>  Go to the part of the book I need (also percentages) </li><li>  When you click on the "Down" book should scroll to the page, rather than the line </li><li>  The book should open in the same place where I finished </li><li>  Lack of brakes and suspensions </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Shasoft eBook v3.1.10 </h4><br>  Prog did not like.  The book on the phone starts about a minute, and then through time!  Wildly slow.  When you press the "Down" button, the text is lowered onto the line, and before that it "thinks" seconds 10. Set up scrolling the screen and not the lines (so that when you click on the down arrow, the text was scrolled onto the screen, not the line) on the other hand, it scrolls to the height of the screen when you press the "6" button.  The screen backlight time is not adjustable, the screen goes out after about 15 seconds. The font itself is kind of clumsy.  There are only three font sizes, and the one that is ‚Äúsmall‚Äù is too small, and the one that is ‚Äúmedium‚Äù is already too large.  But the worst thing is the transition function!  Ie when I launched a book that I didn‚Äôt finish reading on a deceased smart, and wanted to start from where I had finished reading, I was stunned!  Usually, the transition is carried out by interest, well, for example, go to the 70th percentage, but in the Shasoft eBook, this is done character-by-character!  I know that I stopped about a percentage on the 72nd, but what symbol is it ... it turned out that the 610751st ... And I don‚Äôt immediately switch to it, the application hangs, so I first switched to 2048, about two minutes, that‚Äôs what the program thinks when switching to two thousand characters, then to 4069 well, and so, after an hour and a half I got to the chapter of the book I needed. <br>  In general, it is not suitable for comfortable reading, the process proceeds something like this: read half of the screen, lights went out, pressed ‚Äú5‚Äù, read the second half, pressed ‚Äú6‚Äù to waste a page.  Uncomfortable! <br>  <strong>My rating is 4 out of 10.</strong> <br><br><h4>  TequilaCat Book Reader (TCBR) v2.2.13 </h4><br>  Already much better!  Installation is not required.  I downloaded, unpacked, launched.  There are settings for a large number of phones, you can set the size of the file and text block yourself.  You can put several books in one jar file, break them into chapters.  In general, everything you need, including scrolling, and the backlight is configured.  I liked the prog, but there are mins.  I for example like to read green letters on a black background, it is so convenient for me.  This can be customized when converting, but in an already converted book (when it is in the phone) the colors of fonts and backgrounds cannot be changed.  When converting in general, you can specify as many font settings as you like, of any color and size, and then switch between them when reading, but you cannot change them in the phone.  And I also like it when there is a status line at the bottom, where the percentage and time is displayed.  In TequilaCat Book Reader, this line is there, you can put it, you can remove it, but only it goes straight over the last line of text, the same color and no background, which means it merges with the last line, and you have to remove it.  As a result, I removed it, and when I want to know the time, and the read percentage, I pinch the unit, all this info is displayed in a convenient, readable form, as a separate screen, releasing the unit, I again return to the text of the book. <br>  <strong>My rating is 8 out of 10</strong>

    <h4>  mjBook 4.7 </h4><br>  This is already much closer to the topic!  The program is very old, I used it before buying my first smart.  In general, it has almost everything, and even more.  The backlight is adjustable, the size and color of the fonts are also changed.  The background color is set ... The truth is that the colors are a bit uncomfortable.  They need to be set in rgb format ... well, for green and black there are no problems, and it is already problematic to set which thread a different color is more difficult, although this approach is, of course, more flexible, because we have all 16 million colors.  And yet, not everyone knows that for rgb ... There is no status line, and this is a minus, when you read, time flies, and I would like to have this time before my eyes.  But if you click on ‚Äú0‚Äù, information about time, date, how many times a book was opened, and how much time I read it appears ... You can find out the percentage read by accessing Navigator in me, in general it is necessary to go to some part books, but the default is read percentage ... so all this is a bit inconvenient, but I think that the above prog is better.  So, from the minuses of this program - only the absence of the status line.  Not bad! <br>  <strong>My score is 9 out of 10</strong> <br><br><h4>  ReadManiac v2.5.2 </h4><br>  I think this is what you need ... in any case, I settled on this program ... for convenience, almost the same as the previous one, but I am very pleased with the opportunity to open text files from the phone disk ....  That is, you can download ReadManiac once to your phone, and then just upload txt-shniki and open (it‚Äôs written that way, but I didn‚Äôt try, my phone just doesn‚Äôt accept txt without bluetooth, who tried to unsubscribe in the comments).  For me, this is not so important, for me the comfort of reading is important, so let's dwell on it.  So, everything seems to be there, everything is great for all items.  The color of the font and background is selected from the preset, no rgb.  There is a status line with time and ... The current page, which is not very convenient, I still got used to percentages (yes, this is correct, only 100 percent, but there were 5046 pages in my book, although to whom, for me this is a minus).  And the book also slows down quite a bit ... well, or let's say, mjBook is faster. <br>  <strong>My score is 9 out of 10</strong> <br><br><h4>  Push </h4><br>  I opted for ReadManiak, it is this program that suits me on all points, except, of course, measuring the book in pages, not in percentages, although if there was a status line in mjbook, I would use it. <br><br><h4>  PS </h4><br>  All programs are free.  You can download it <a href="http://boliev.com/archives/272">here</a> . <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/42955/">https://habr.com/ru/post/42955/</a></p>
