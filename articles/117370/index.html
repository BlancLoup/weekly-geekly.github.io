If you think that nothing will come of you, you are right. <br>  If you think that everything will work out for you, you are also right. <br>  <i>Henry Ford</i> <br><br><h4>  Preamble </h4><br>  In my online store, located in Moscow, delivery of orders is carried out both by couriers in Moscow and by mail throughout Russia.  I do not give links, since this is not PR, and habraeffekt - a serious thing. <br>  I started sending parcels not long ago, and when the number of sent parcels was close to 50, I was able to make some statistical generalizations.

      I wanted to make generalizations when I learned that Post Office Russia has control dates for the delivery of packages - that is, those terms in which they themselves (no one was pulling the tongue) promise to deliver the packages.  <a href="http://fc.russianpost.ru/DownLoad/For_Site/Uslugi/Post/Doc26.doc">The table</a> ( <a href="http://landc.ru/photos/habr/deadlines.doc">mirror</a> ) gives the control dates of deliveries between federal cities. <br>  I wondered how the mail keeps its promises. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The approximate scheme of the travel package is: <br>  Post Office - parcel reception -&gt; car -&gt; Regional sorting workshop by place of departure -&gt; train -&gt; Regional sorting workshop by place of receipt -&gt; car -&gt; Collection point. <br><br>  From the description of the control dates, it follows that the number of days indicated in the table is the period of travel between the centers of districts and districts.  Plus, we throw a maximum of 4 days on delivery to the settlement, if it is located in the region, and not in the regional center. <br><br>  So, some statistics, while no characteristics. <br><br><h6>  Minimum number of days. </h6><br><br>  One parcel flew by airmail, and she was very lucky - she flew to Sakhalin in 5 days.  It was a fluke, since the rest of the air fleet flew there in 8-10 days. <br>  From the same ones that traveled by land, the minimum was 6 days.  One of them was traveling from Moscow to the Moscow region, if you count on the road - about 145 kilometers. <br>  Another - in Yaroslavl, is 267 kilometers.  By the way, parcels go to Yaroslavl the fastest - you must pay tribute to their sorting center. <br><br><h6>  Maximum number of days. </h6><br><br>  For 40 days, the parcel went by land to Sakhalin (by train, ferry, again by train).  Apparently, at one of the sorting points it lain for ten days in a corner, because the remaining delivery times to the remote corners of our vast Motherland were no more than 30 days.  Of course, this is Sakhalin Island and Yakutia.  By the way, the control period from Moscow to Yakutia is the largest - 22 days before Yakutsk, and another 4 days in (relatively) nearby areas. <br><br><h5>  Delivery speed </h5><br><br>  I measured the distance from Moscow to each of the destinations, with the help of a <a href="http://www.autotransinfo.ru/Trace/">service</a> that counts the distances not directly, but along the roads.  Then divided by the delivery time, and received the average speed of movement of the parcel. <br>  The indicator is very conditional, since quite a lot of time the parcels are carried out at the sorting points, and they most likely move by train, but I can draw some conclusions from it. <br><br><h6>  Minimum speed </h6><br><br>  With the speed of a sick disabled turtle crawling to die, parcels were moving around Moscow and to the regional city of Solnechnogorsk.  True, in the second case, as it turned out later, the parcel simply lain unnoticed at the post office for some time.  But the first case is screaming - the distance of 28 kilometers parcel overcame in 13 days.  This is about 2 kilometers per day. <br><br><h6>  Maximum speed. </h6><br><br>  Schumacher showed himself airing, which covered up to 1,800 kilometers per day.  Damn it, what a huge country - Russia ... From Moscow to Sakhalin - more than 9000 kilometers.  And this is only from Moscow. <br>  The characteristic speed of ground parcels is 200-400 kilometers per day. <br>  The average speed was 241 km / day, and the median - 118 km / d.  This means that half of the packages per day covered less than 120 km. <br>  The velocity distribution (in some sense, the logarithmic scale) is on the graph.  For example, it is clearly seen from it that three-quarters of packages travel less than 300 km per day. <br><br><img src="http://landc.ru/photos/habr/speed_chart.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Target dates </h5><br><br>  An even more interesting thing is how much, and how often, the mail exceeds the deadlines for deliveries for which it has taken obligations.  So, we divide the actual period by the promised, and we get the excess. <br><br><h6>  Maximum excess </h6><br><br>  Record holders were the lost Solnogorsk package, and Moscow.  By Fed.  the center of the parcel should walk for no more than 3 days, and crawled 13. Excess - 4.3 times.  In the area - no more than 4 days, and it was all 28. Well, this is an exceptional case. <br>  Every tenth parcel exceeded the promised date more than twice.  At 60% exceeded the delivery time not more than 2 times. <br>  For a complete presentation I give the second schedule. <br><br><img src="http://landc.ru/photos/habr/srok_chart.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Excess of 1.3 times I chose as the most acceptable.  It turns out.  that 40% of the packages arrived at all, without delay, another 20% - in a reasonable time (that is, only 60% were acceptable), and the remaining 40% - for unacceptable. <br>  On average, the delivery time exceeds the promised one by 1.47 times.  The median for this parameter shows 1.1 - that is, half of the parcels arrive almost on time. <br><br><h4>  Plot </h4><br><br>  Case of life.  The parcel was sent to the buyer on 03/28/2011.  A tracking number was received, in the evening it appeared in the database and on <a href="http://www.russianpost.ru/rp/servise/ru/home/postuslug/trackingpo">the parcel tracking page of the Russian Post</a> . <br><br>  After 10 days, 04/07/2011, the status of "adopted" has not changed.  The client is naturally worried. <br>  I turned to the post office and received an answer - you can apply for a search, but not earlier than 30 days after sending the parcel. <br>  After learning to take my word for it, I returned home and made inquiries on the Internet.  Of course they lied to me! <br>  In fact, the sender has the right to file an application to search for a parcel immediately after the deadline. <br><br>  I downloaded and filled out a <a href="http://fc.russianpost.ru/DownLoad/For_Site/Uslugi/Blanks/Prilog_4.doc">search application form.</a>  ( <a href="http://landc.ru/photos/habr/search_find.doc">mirror</a> ) <br><br>  The application was filed on the evening of April 7th. <br><img src="http://landc.ru/photos/habr/talon.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The next day, the status of the parcel has been updated!  He showed that on April 7 (oh, what an amazing coincidence!) The package arrived at the sorting center of the Kazan station. <br><br>  As evidence - tracking id: 12959436048467 <br><br>  Where was the parcel from March 28 to April 7, and why she was able to overcome 7 kilometers from the post office to the Kazan station in only 10 days - will remain a secret for centuries. <br><br>  True, in my post office, the operators have mentioned that with those 12 parcels that were sent that day, there was a little trouble.  The driver took them "not there."  One of the senders of these unlucky parcels also began to search for them. <br><br>  I didn‚Äôt keep in mind how a driver could take a package ‚Äúnot there‚Äù.  Where "not there"?  In the dark forest parcel hauled?  To my mother in pancakes?  If he took them somewhere, someone had to take them from him!  Sign up for them in the end.  The driver took them to the wrong place, and the wrong one took them there and not ... <br><br>  Earlier, I had already filed such an application, and with exactly the same result, it was a parcel to St. Petersburg, which was also lost at first, and then magically found and updated the status in the system the very next day after submitting the application.  By the way, that package went to Sestroretsk for 25 days. <br><br>  After talking heart to heart with the head of my post office, I found out that she did not enter these statements into any database.  She makes an extract - in what bag, with what driver when the parcel left.  And sends all the documentation by mail (recursion) to the central office.  Where they are already processed. <br><br>  It turns out that both times it was a coincidence.  Pretty weird. <br><br>  By the way, often on weekends, the Mail site does not work.  Apparently, it turns off to save electricity.  I give out a secret link to the internal mail site, which works separately from the main one, where there is also a parcel tracking form: <a href="http://info.russianpost.ru/servlet/post_item">info.russianpost.ru/servlet/post_item</a> <br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br><br>  So, it turns out that 40% of packages arrive with unacceptable delays.  This is chaos.  Surprisingly, mail delays parcels with respect to such deadlines that they set for themselves. <br>  I will clarify that, as a rule, there are no complaints about the final points - to the post offices in the field.  They honestly work out their little money, pack the parcels and send them.  The most interesting thing happens between them. <br><br>  Of course, the public service is clumsy by definition, and is hardly interested in improving work, without any competition.  But I believe that even such a service can be shaken. <br><br>  I decided that now, every time when the parcel deadline passes, and she has not yet arrived at the district center at her destination, I will submit an application for a search.  In the application I leave my contact phone number, on which you are obliged to call, report on the results of the search, and ask whether I need a written report. <br>  Yes!  I will need a written report, with detailed explanations of where and why the parcel spent more time than it was allotted to it. <br>  And so - with each package. <br><br>  And then I remembered about habraeffekt. <br><br>  If everyone who mailed a parcel, after the expiry of the delivery deadline, will write an application for a search.  And will require a written response ... <br><br>  Do not answer, do not call? <br>  <a href="http://www.russianpost.ru/rp/servise/ru/home/postuslug/controlquality">Contacts for quality control of Russian Post.</a>  Free telephone hotline, e-mail ... <br><br>  It is legal, legitimate and completely free.  After all, we will demand from the management of the post only what they themselves have promised.  It is time to arrange habraeffekt for Post of Russia. <br><br>  I emphasize - it will not be hooliganism or a meaningless flash mob. <br><br>  This will be an attempt to stir up the state structure, to show its citizenship, to increase the amount of order in the work of the state.  If there are deadlines, they must be fulfilled, otherwise why are they? <br><br>  Of course, the result of the action may be an increase in the delivery deadlines, I do not exclude such an outcome.  But I think that even this will be beneficial - because it will mean a transition from disorder to order, and going one step away from disorganization. <br><br>  Let me quote a passage from the excellent book by Vladimir Tarasov, <a href="http://school.realmagic.ru/lib/heroes.htm">Principles of Life</a> : <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúIf every thing is in its place, every person is where he should be, and he does what he has to do, this is order.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>If the order is violated, then we can say who the violator is and what is violated is a mess.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>If the order is violated, but you cannot say who exactly is to blame and what exactly he violated - this is disorganization.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Disorganization is worse than disorder.</i>  <i>With her, fear and fearlessness change places.</i>  <i>Scary to keep order.</i>  <i>And it's okay to break it.</i>  <i>That's what disorganization is. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  But it is possible, it is quite possible to improve the work of the Post. <br>  I believe that in the presence of such a probability, we simply have to make efforts to achieve a result.  One cannot expect an improvement in the work of state services by decree ‚Äúfrom above‚Äù - only on the initiative from below. <br><br>  You may say that I'm a dreamer <br>  But I'm not the only one ... <br><br>  Will do? <br><br>  UPDATE: Once again to fix: <br>  Download and fill out a <a href="http://fc.russianpost.ru/DownLoad/For_Site/Uslugi/Blanks/Prilog_4.doc">search application form.</a>  ( <a href="http://landc.ru/photos/habr/search_find.doc">mirror</a> ) <br><br>  To whom - you will be prompted at the post office, usually the boss. <br>  From whom - from you. <br>  The reason for the application is not received. <br>  Special marks - with declared value, etc. <br>  Filing date and reg.  number (tracking). <br>  Where to whom. <br><br>  Give in your post office.  The application will be accepted, a tear-off coupon will be filled in, stamped and given to you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117370/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117370/</a></p>
