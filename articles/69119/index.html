  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Energynet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I want to share the content of the report, which came across on the network.  There is such a person - Juval Lowy.  Founder Idesign, author of several books, Microsoft Regional Director at Silicon Valley.  At Teched 2009, he gave a presentation somewhat unusual for the format of this event.  In it, Juwal predicts that the next IT boom will occur very soon and will be associated with the development of the alternative energy market.  Juval argues his position and advises developers how to prepare for a boom. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h2>  Forerunners </h2><br>  Currently, several successful entrepreneurs from Silicon Valley have started businesses related to alternative energy, as they believe that this market will soon undergo a strong upturn. <br><br>  In the US, there is already not enough energy.  In California, for example, they practice the so-called brownouts (dimming of shop-window lighting in the evening) and blackouts (power outage).

      New power plants are difficult to build, long and harmful to the environment.  It is beneficial for the government to develop local power generation.  It is not as fantastic as it may seem.  There is already a paint with nanoparticles that allows you to make a solar battery from almost any surface (for example, the roofs and walls of existing buildings).  There are also projects for installing propellers in the ocean and generating electricity through photosynthesis.  For which technology the future is unknown.  Dzhuval compares this with the situation of the early nineties, when there were many network protocols and it was not clear that in the end TCP / IP would be widely used. <br><br>  In addition to the development of generators operating on renewable energy sources, they are investing in the development of electric machines (+ hybrid variants) and energy converters.  And Google (http://www.google.org/powermeter/) and Microsoft (http://www.microsoft-hohm.com/) have recently written and posted programs for calculating and optimizing energy consumption in a house. <br><br><h2>  IT capabilities </h2><br>  It is impossible to drastically improve the physics and chemistry of existing processes of obtaining and converting energy.  But you can improve the software that controls its creation and use. <br><br>  The cost of one kilowatt depends on the capacity and workload of the grid.  Workload depends on the time of day, year, holidays, and weather.  The program can, on the basis of previous measurements, weather forecast, personal calendar, distribute energy among the consumers of electricity in the house.  For example, a dishwasher can be turned on deep at night, as clean dishes are needed no earlier than the morning, and energy is cheaper at night.  If a system takes a lot of energy to start (for example, a storage water heater for many liters), then it may be worth not turning it off, but switching it to the minimum power consumption mode.  Priorities are important - drying clothes will wait, and the heating in the children's room should never be turned off.  Another urgent task is not to spend on electricity more than a predetermined amount of money. <br><br>  Electric machines as very voracious consumers represent a separate class of devices.  The software for them should determine when to change the batteries, whether to put them on charge from the power source in the house or whether they should be charged in the parking lot near the supermarket.  In the latter case, integration of the recharge management system and the supermarket billing system is needed. <br><br>  You can redistribute energy if the car is charged to the eyeballs, and the house does not have enough energy for heating.  And in the case of a settlement, where every second person has his own generator, it would be possible to sell surplus energy to neighbors and buy from them in case of shortage (while observing the prescriptions and laws of the government). <br><br>  All such software in the aggregate is Energynet.  A power grid in which various devices and systems are integrated, and energy consumption is optimized. <br><br><h2>  Popular technology </h2><br>  The demand will be what the main players in the new market will need.  You should follow the requirements, find out what problems these companies face, what they want to realize. <br><br>  But now we can say that knowledge will be required: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Distribute commuting, cloud computing (Windows Azures) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Security &amp; Network (WCF) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Mobile devices <br><br>  Note: Juwal is the regional director of Microsoft, his company is engaged in consulting on new .NET technologies, therefore Microsoft technologies are presented in his report. <br><br>  Cross-disciplines will be highly demanded.  Particularly valuable will be programmers with knowledge of energy, circuit design, control theory of complex systems, mechanics, physics. <br><br><h2>  findings </h2><br>  Energynet provides great opportunities for developers.  Money is already invested there by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs.  There are few resources, consumer demands are growing, electric cars are on the way.  The report itself caused a lively discussion.  I learned about it from a Dot Net Rocks transfer dedicated to MEF technology.  Instead of discussing the topic of the program, Carl and Richard and Kathleen Dollard (head of the MEF division) discussed the report with enthusiasm. <br><br>  I believe that this is a very interesting opinion and it should be taken into account when choosing which technology to study in order to be in demand in the future. <br><br>  It should be understood that first of all these trends will affect the United States, since the problem has matured there.  Most likely, these considerations will also be relevant for countries dependent on foreign energy resources.  This wave may affect Russia very little.  Unless as a provision of specialists and programmers to solve problems. <br><br><h2>  Original source </h2><br>  1. <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx%3FshowNum%3D436">www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=436</a> <br>  2. <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay%3Fdocid%3D4831440850220717845">video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4831440850220717845</a> <br>  3. <a href="http://www.msteched.com/online/view.aspx%3Ftid%3Df7ebae7b-2276-4d4a-8553-7d4d4df509e1">www.msteched.com/online/view.aspx?tid=f7ebae7b-2276-4d4a-8553-7d4d4df509e1</a> <br><br><h2>  Sidebar - The Greatest Virtualization System </h2><br>  <i>‚ÄúIt belongs to Brazilian companies Userful and ThinNetworks and includes 3,56800 working environments, the use of each of which costs $ 50.</i>  <i>The system, consisting of 18,750 workstations, will be applied in Brazilian schools.</i>  <i>A separate station will be able to serve up to 10 people with their own screen, keyboard and mouse.</i>  <i>As stated, virtualization will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 170 thousand tons and reduce energy consumption by 80% compared to a network of ordinary computers.</i>  <i>‚Äû</i> <br>  (http://www.3dnews.ru/tags/%D0%93%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%81) <br><br>  This is why electricity needs to be saved and what an important role the software plays. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/69119/">https://habr.com/ru/post/69119/</a></p>
