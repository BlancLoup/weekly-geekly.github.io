  <section class="page js-page"><h1>AllMyChanges Mission</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When <a href="https://allmychanges.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Dour-mission">our project was</a> in its infancy, it was based on the hypothesis that a changelog can be found for almost any library, and if you cannot find it, you can build it from commitmitages.  But the reality was not as rosy as we wanted: either the changelog file in some ugly format would fall, then it was no longer kept, and the product was developing, then something else.  And then we realized that splitting the world is not enough, we need to change it. <br><br><h2>  To change something in one moment is an extraordinarily difficult task. </h2><br>  Therefore, we do not set ourselves such a goal.  The mission of <a href="https://allmychanges.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Dour-mission">AllMyChanges</a> is to let developers around the world understand that <code>ChangeLog</code> is their way of interacting with the outside world, the same channel as a blog or a twitter account. <br><br> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/d_t_vos/15962916323" title="Mr. Speaker by Dick Vos, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/806/55a/69d/80655a69d4418827b56ae10296965710.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Mr. Speaker"></a>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"

      Before the advent of our service, it was difficult to compare a simple ChangeLog with a blog, since there was no way to subscribe to updates.  After all, a link to the rss blog feed can be thrown into the rss reader, you can subscribe to the social profile, follow a person, and it was difficult to subscribe to library changes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Some developers, seeing such a problem, are trying to build communication with users of their libraries or API using blogs.  There they write about releases, sometimes they seal cats and other news, maybe not directly related to releases.  But so few do, because to blog for each of their opensource libraries is very expensive and, you see, it's much easier <br>  add sections in <code>ChangeLog.md</code> file and commit it to the repository. <br><br>  GitHub, for its part, is also trying to give developers an interface for communication built around repositories.  It's called <a href="https://github.com/blog/1547-release-your-software">GitHub Releases</a> .  It works like this: you put a git tag with a version, then, instead of adding a ChangeLog, you go to the GitHub interface and add a description of what happened for the release.  To all this, you can attach some binary artifacts, such as collected under different platforms.  For releases made using GitHub Releases, an RSS feed is generated, there is no other way to subscribe to project news, except for third-party services like <a href="http://bit.ly/1RnQuyz">Sibbell</a> or <a href="https://allmychanges.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Dour-mission">AllMyChanges</a> .  True, Sibbel works only with GitHub Releases, and in AllMyChanges there is no such restriction, it works with any sources. <br><br>  By the way, according to our calculations, about 10% of all projects that have been added to AllMyChanges use the release service on a githaba.  That is why more recently, we supported the GitHub Releases, as another data source.  They come through the narrow tube on the right: <br><br> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/identity-chris-is/71240905" title="Window and ... pipes by Christopher Tweed, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/17b/505/881/17b505881c7b833fae763d7e0e4f1709.jpg" width="505" height="640" alt="Window and ... pipes"></a> <br><br><h2>  Communication is <strike>our</strike> your everything </h2><br>  API developers also have a great need for a communication channel.  Many of them do not want to admit it and in every possible way hide the information that and when they change in the API, but there are also good guys who are well aware that only regular interaction with users allows us to build a healthy developer community. <br><br>  By the way, the same situation is now in the market of mobile applications.  Many companies are now aware that release-noutsy is an excellent communication channel and begin to use them for their intended purpose, not only transferring important information about the changes in the software, but also entertaining their users.  Look, for example, at what <a href="https://allmychanges.com/p/ios/slack/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Dour-mission">Slack</a> and <a href="https://allmychanges.com/p/ios/Trello/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Dour-mission">Trello</a> developers are writing. <br><br>  So, the mission of AllMyChanges is to reduce the number of guys who write in their release notes: "This update includes minor improvements" and turn away from the wall, falling asleep with a sense of accomplishment.  Do not be among them, tell your users about what is happening, encourage them to subscribe to the changelog on <a href="https://allmychanges.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Dour-mission">AllMyChanges</a> . <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/260823/">https://habr.com/ru/post/260823/</a></p>
