      Social networks have become a window into a wonderful new world of communication opportunities.  Ideally, you need to create official representations of your company wherever there are your players.  But do not try to cover everything and at once with small forces: one strong community is better than a dozen abandoned. <br><br>  The community manager of a game public should serve the highest goals: <br><br>  - bring vox populi to the developers; <br>  - to be for the player a friend, a psychologist and a technical support agent at the same time; <br>  - talk about innovations, train and give useful tips; <br>  - maintain the reputation of the project and brand at a high level; <br>  - create and maintain a unique harmonious atmosphere in the community. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/QXfEowLTYCg&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh2Om59fiqtCuGUQlHQHGRkDoOXQQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  No support, call centers, offline meetings and forums will replace the social network community, where they can quickly get an answer to the question of interest, without being distracted from viewing pictures with cats. <br><br>  <b>Out of a thousand</b> <br><br>  The first thing to do is to identify the target audience.  This is a truism, which for some reason, not everyone follows, despite the fact that Facebook is trying hard to help the administrators of the pages and provides a lot of different metrics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3d1/269/b49/3d1269b49d4c4dd5be1295d17ed69908.png"><br><br>  Statistics allows you to know where your subscribers live, what they are interested in, what time they most often appear on the network and what content they like.  In the collection of all this information will help the new tool - <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/audience-insights">Audience Insights.</a>  With it, you can easily get demographic data, find out which pages, besides yours, are visited by the user, which language he speaks and in which supermarkets he buys products on weekends.  When planning publications, you should remember the number of daily Facebook users (DAU - 1.23 billion) and the average number of pages to which they are subscribed (about 70).  Also, do not forget <a href="http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/news-feed-algorithm-change-improving-timeliness-of-posts/300956%3Fred%3Dif">about the features of the algorithms</a> used by the platform when displaying news to each user. <br><br>  Do not be afraid to experiment and stand out from the gray mass.  The metric allows you to learn a lot about users, even their favorite words (depending on the region of residence) and visited establishments.  Use this knowledge to win the love of subscribers. <br><br>  In addition, working with the target audience, it is necessary to highlight the main personality matrix, to understand how certain groups of people react to the content posted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/506/26e/765/50626e765bde4c068294eb3ff735bad5.png"><br><br>  <b>Catch muse</b> <br><br>  Perhaps at the start you will have a bunch of ideas for content.  It is possible that none.  Anyway, all good ideas tend to exhaust themselves very quickly.  To keep the content always interesting and fresh, you should buy inspiration in different places: <br><br>  <b>1. Product</b> <br>  Any product is always a source of gigabytes of content.  In our case, this game functionality, unique types of troops, buildings, objects, quests, plot details, character descriptions, game tips and tricks.  The list is endless. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f05/023/23c/f0502323c7fd4199affda71b1cc17c30.jpg"><br><br>  <b>2. Users</b> <br>  Community members can also inspire administrators for creative exploits.  Their quotes, questions and the so-called user generated content are the main riches of the public. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4de/e47/055/4dee470553944354bbd23e869b4d3783.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f95/f47/521/f95f47521ccd4d4e9ac37d932ed5d785.png"><br><br>  <b>3. Trends</b> <br>  A good community manager lives in social networks.  He knows in what numbers the heir to the British throne should be born, when the new Radiohead album comes out and why it is worth to wait a little with the purchase of Heroes III HD, and skillfully uses all this information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e5b/658/20f/e5b65820f9ab49669617085c1c5f695b.png"><br><br>  Such post-congratulations from our game characters, stylized under the first version of Facebook, were made on each project.  We hit the #FacebookBirthDay trend and were able to achieve a very good Engagement Rate (5-7%) without using the Boost Post function. <br><br>  <b>4. Holidays</b> <br>  For the Russian people every day is a holiday.  It will be more difficult with English-speaking communities, but for them you can also find a huge number of days in the calendar, which will be an excellent information guide. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2e7/509/f4b/2e7509f4b9444408bf1dc6c2ba5ee99a.png"><br><br>  <b>5. Humor</b> <br>  Sometimes it is useful to defuse the situation with a funny contest or an unexpected interactive.  As a rule, users are positive about a bit of madness in public. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2e4/ab3/34f/2e4ab334f6fc42e48bccc69adec46b34.png"><br><br>  <b>6. Theme Communities</b> <br>  Some brilliant ideas can be peeped in similar public pages.  The method of Ctrl + C &amp; Ctrl + V is better not to use, but no one forbids inspiring anyone's creativity. <br><br>  <b>Involvement and interaction</b> <br><br>  Ask questions, try to engage users in the discussion.  Let them communicate and learn more about the project and about each other. <br><br>  Life hacking: even if the post did not collect a lot of likes and rassharivaniya, do not be upset.  You can find a couple of sensible comments and develop a dialogue with their authors - this will increase the Engagement Rate, and subscribers will be pleased with the attention of company representatives. <br><br>  Infographic in original size can be <a href="http://http:https:https:">found here.</a> <br><br><img src="//habrastorage.org/files/048/003/38e/04800338ed58498ca1fe0583c4d8f798.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/376911/">https://habr.com/ru/post/376911/</a></p>
