The so-called reverse takeover procedure will allow Dell to <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/01/29/dell_vmware_reverse_merge/">avoid</a> re-entering the IPO and pay off some of the debt.

      <br>
      According <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp%3FcontainerId%3DprUS43147217">to</a> IDC, in the third quarter of 2017, Dell ranked third (after Lenovo and HP) in the supply of personal computers and had a market share of 16%.  Dell's annual revenue from 2014 to 2017 <a href="https://amigobulls.com/stocks/DVMT/income-statement/annual">increased</a> from $ 14 billion to $ 61 billion. <br><br>  At the same time, VMware‚Äôs revenue <a href="https://amigobulls.com/stocks/VMW/income-statement/annual">grows by</a> an average of a billion a year: in 2017 it <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/01/27/vmware_fy_2016_results/">amounted to</a> 7 billion, which is 8 times less than that of Dell.  Therefore, if the acquisition of Dell by VMware is confirmed, it turns out that a smaller organization will buy a larger one. <br><br><h2>  Why Dell needs this deal </h2><br>  It's all about the debts that Dell has accumulated after taking over EMC.  In 2013, before corporation CEO Michael Dell privatized the company, the amount of debt <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-02/dell-board-still-mulling-options-but-not-considering-a-sale">was estimated</a> at 7 billion.  Now the organization is in debt of 48.5 billion dollars.  Therefore, the ability to pay part of the debt is one of the reasons why the transaction can be profitable. <br><br>  If VMware buys Dell, the latter will become a public company without an IPO.  According <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-30/here-s-what-a-dell-vmware-combination-could-look-like">to</a> Ilya Kundozerov, a stock analyst from the Morningstar Investment Service, with such a development, a smaller company could sell its shares and help the IT giant pay off the debt. <br><br>  However, Ivan Feinseth, director of investments at Tigress Financial Partners, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-30/here-s-what-a-dell-vmware-combination-could-look-like">argues</a> that even in the case of Dell‚Äôs purchase and transfer of VMware debt, the virtualization software developer will pay out $ 3.5 billion in cash flow of $ 3.5 billion . <br><br><h2>  Possible consequences </h2><br>  According to IDC, in recent years, the global PC market has <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp%3FcontainerId%3DprUS43147217">been reduced</a> by 0.5% annually: it has been squeezed by the smartphone and tablet market.  In such circumstances, server technology remains the hope for Dell, working with which in November last year brought the company $ 56 billion in net income.  However, Dell‚Äôs operating expenses rose sharply from $ 10 billion to $ 17 billion, resulting in an operating loss of $ 3 billion. <br><br>  The Register <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/01/26/dell_ipo_reports/">believes</a> that after the transaction, Dell has enough resources to enter the cloud market.  Thanks to its hyper-scalable servers and support from VMware, Virtustream, Pivotal and Boomi, the corporation will be able to leave behind its competitor, HPE. <br><br>  Bloomberg also <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-29/dell-is-said-to-eye-vmware-dell-under-one-roof-slashing-debt">believes</a> that reverse takeover will benefit both Dell and VMware customers.  Collaborative products and solutions will help end users reduce costs by more tightly integrating virtualization solutions with server technologies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ni/lv/gr/nilvgrje-cej2a4zl8yp3xx68fo.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jerryluo0520/5916924993/">Jerry Luo</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC</a></i></font> <br><br><h2>  Other options </h2><br>  As Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-30/here-s-what-a-dell-vmware-combination-could-look-like">writes</a> , an alternative for Dell could be selling shares on an IPO without changing relations with VMware.  Due to this, it is possible to attract additional capital from the outside.  This is what happened with Alibaba: its shares <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/alibaba-ipo-september-19-2014-9">jumped</a> 38% on the first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  But this is more likely a rarity, so with such a development, the risks for the organization will be significant, because independent Dell without joining VMware is less attractive to investors (because of debts). <br><br>  Another <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-30/here-s-what-a-dell-vmware-combination-could-look-like">option</a> : Dell buys the remaining share of VMware (20% of the shares).  According <a href="https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst%2BComments/Barclays%2BSays%2BNot%2BSo%2BFast%2Bon%2Bthe%2BDell-for-VMware%2B%2528VMW%2529%2BRumors/13727894.html">to</a> analysts at Barclays, the cost of the transaction would be from 12.1 to 12.6 billion dollars.  Then the joint organization turns from private to public and issues shares to the market.  Feinset <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-30/here-s-what-a-dell-vmware-combination-could-look-like">claims</a> that such a move would allow $ 30 billion for the corporation.  However, Barclays analysts <a href="https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst%2BComments/Barclays%2BSays%2BNot%2BSo%2BFast%2Bon%2Bthe%2BDell-for-VMware%2B%2528VMW%2529%2BRumors/13727894.html">warn</a> that this is not the best option for a company that is trying to pay debts.  Because for the purchase of VMware will need to lend more money. <br><br>  According <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-29/dell-is-said-to-eye-vmware-dell-under-one-roof-slashing-debt">to</a> anonymous insiders, the Dell board of directors will discuss in detail all options, including reverse takeovers, within a month. <br><br><hr><br>  What is reverse takeover? <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">Definition on the Wiki</a> and more on <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/09/introduction-reverse-mergers.asp">Investopedia</a> . <br><br><hr><br>  Some materials on the topic from the First Corporate IaaS Blog: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/funkcionalnost/organizaciya-blokchejn-na-vmware-vsphere-ot-teorii-k-praktike/">Organizing the blockchain on VMware vSphere: from theory to practice</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/resheniya/migraciya-mezhdu-oblakami-c-ispolzovaniem-instrumentov-vmware/">Migration between clouds using VMware tools</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/novosti/vmworld-2017-insajd-glazami-inzhenera/">VMworld 2017: inside the eyes of an engineer</a> </li></ul><br><hr><br>  What else do we write on Habr√©: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/348078/">The development of hyper-convergent technologies: a new version of HyperFlex 3.0 from Cisco</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/347448/">‚ÄúCourse on hyperscale‚Äù: there are almost 400 hyper-scalable data centers in the world</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/345644/">What domestic startups use virtual infrastructure</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/348238/">https://habr.com/ru/post/348238/</a></p>
