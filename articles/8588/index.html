Even with a highly trained memory, a person living in a modern rhythm is not able to memorize two hundred phones of his fifty acquaintances, arrange everything in time for the current week, keep all started projects in mind and be completely sure that he knows where the document and for which project exactly it has ... <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>From paper to iChronos</b> <br>  For such cases, notebooks, diaries and organizers have long been invented to help a person.  Initially, they were exclusively paper, later - paper-mechanical (I personally saw the paper-mechanical phone book. When I pressed the key-letter, the mechanism opened the necessary page with the records).  Recently, the progress suggests using various types of electronic program organizers and notebooks that are crammed literally everywhere. <br>  The most famous organizer is probably Microsoft Outlook, which, unfortunately, does not at all indicate its superiority in terms of quality and convenience.  Therefore, programmers to the extent complement the range of alternatives.  Russian developers also do not stand aside, traditionally showing originality of thinking and ingenuity.  For example, if the <a href="http://www.ichronos.ru/" title="iChronos 2.0">iChronos 2.0</a> organizer from the Smart Project firm is not a standard of convenience and functionality (although it is very convenient and functional), then the standard of style and clarity is almost certainly. <br><br>  <b>Another desktop</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.ichronos.ru/" title="iChronos 2.0">iChronos 2.0</a> is most similar to ... Windows.  At least, the principles of the Smart Project people took exactly the same: visibility and manipulation of all kinds of resources and data as objects on a single desktop.  Outwardly, it looks like this. <br>  The central place in the program is a two-dimensional field smoothly scaled on the wheel of the mouse.  This is the desktop.  On it are various objects that can be folded into hierarchical structures, and can be completely independent. <br>  Objects in <a href="http://www.ichronos.ru/" title="iChronos 2.0">iChronos 2.0</a> are: contact cards, cards of historical characters, notes, tasks, calls, meetings, reminders, events, holidays, files, folders and "projects". <br>  ‚ÄúProjects‚Äù are internal iChronos folders into which you can add various types of objects united by a common task or goal.  Next, we dwell on this concept. <br>  At the bottom of the working screen of the program there is a time ribbon, where all objects related to the fourth dimension are marked: meetings, calls, tasks, reminders.  The time line also smoothly scales, covering the time from individual hours to the segment between the XVI and XXV century. <br>  On the left in the form of a tree painted the structure of objects on the table.  The working area and this list of objects are completely identical, operations for dragging objects and creating new ones can be carried out both there and there. <br>  Finally, to the left below is a to-do list - the most traditional option of all organizers in <a href="http://www.ichronos.ru/" title="iChronos 2.0">iChronos 2.0</a> .

She is very simple.  In fact, the real prototype of the project is a folder with the inscription "Case number ..." in which you can file everything that is relevant. <br>  Suppose you decided to buy a car - and you decided to formalize the process in <a href="http://www.ichronos.ru/" title="iChronos 2.0">iChronos 2.0</a> . <br>  First we create at the top level (this is not necessary, by the way. You can shove the project into the ‚Äúfactory‚Äù folder ‚ÄúTasks‚Äù) the folder-project ‚ÄúBuying a car‚Äù.  We create the task ‚ÄúBuying a car‚Äù with deadlines ... well, let's say, from May 16 to June 16, 2007.  It is necessary that on the tape of time in the window "Today" the corresponding inscription always shines. <br>  After studying the car market, we gathered enough information with tips on how to choose your car.  In order not to lose anything, we will create shortcuts for these documents in the ‚ÄúPurchase of a car‚Äù folder (by the way, iChronos can create shortcuts for any documents: texts, music, video, pictures, programs (exe files), links). <br>  Soon in the case of buying people appear.  Suppose the first one is an expert, the name is Demid Petrovich Cook, and the second is the seller of a used Audi-100, Roman Ivanovich Zagolsky.  Create their contacts directly in the folder project "Shopping." <br>  Soon the case goes into the endgame: on May 30, from 16.00 to 18.00, we have an appointment with Demid Petrovich in the Bochka cafe - we mark this with a corresponding entry.  And on June 7, at 12.00, we talk on the phone with Roman Ivanitch - we also note this burning fact. <br>  After the case is resolved positively, the project can be erased by first transferring the person Demid Ivanych to the general ‚ÄúPeople‚Äù contact list: a good autoexpert is still useful to us ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/c8f/7f6/686/c8f7f6686c1100881decd27cf0f995fc.jpg" width="450" height="337" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  <b>Good but not enough</b> <br>  When a program is bad it is useless to praise it.  If the program is good, it needs to be scolded a bit so that in future versions it will become even better.  <a href="http://www.ichronos.ru/" title="iChronos 2.0">iChronos 2.0</a> - the program is very good.  It is all the more offensive to see mistakes in it, because of which its use does not make it possible to finally abandon the search for alternatives. <br>  First, in <a href="http://www.ichronos.ru/" title="iChronos 2.0">iChronos 2.0, there are</a> practically no ways to synchronize data with other organizers and PDAs.  Yes, export from Outlook is normal.  Yes, the iChronos program is very original and the planning concepts realized with its help are very difficult to transfer to traditional organizers.  But the fact remains that a collaboration with a PDA or other programs has been practically ordered to the user of <a href="http://www.ichronos.ru/" title="iChronos 2.0">iChronos 2.0</a> . <br>  Secondly, it is very unfortunate that <a href="http://www.ichronos.ru/" title="iChronos 2.0">iChronos 2.0</a> does not support the concept of ‚Äúcross-cutting‚Äù objects belonging to several projects at once.  This is very bad, for example, when working with contacts that have to be extracted from the general ‚ÄúPeople‚Äù pool to participate in a project.  Or manually make a copy of it.  In general, I would like all objects to be connected to each other by some kind of hyperlink: if the meeting with Ivan Petrovich is written in the time line, then when we click on his name, we could go to the contact card of this gentleman. <br>  Finally, thirdly, the glitches with the imposition of different windows on the desktop and the impossibility of automatically arranging objects on its surface are very tiring.  This also - to graphic misunderstandings - can be attributed, and leapfrog with stripes of events on the tape of time.  Sometimes their layers are so complicated that it becomes almost impossible to restore order manually.  But there is no automatic ordering again ... <br><br>  <b>Still, <a href="http://www.ichronos.ru/" title="iChronos 2.0">iChronos 2.0</a> is a very powerful, original, understandable and convenient organizer.</b>  <b>We hope that in the new version he will get rid of his few, but important shortcomings</b> . <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/8588/">https://habr.com/ru/post/8588/</a></p>
