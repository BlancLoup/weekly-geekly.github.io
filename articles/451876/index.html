Telehouse Frankfurt, a highly reliable data processing center, is one of the data centers of the European company Telehouse (headquartered in London), which in turn is a subsidiary of the global Japanese telecommunications corporation <a href="https://www.kddi.com/english/">KDDI</a> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ed/620/57a/3ed62057af2b236e350ca5095f74e7f1.jpg"></div><br>  We have already written about our other sites more than once.  Today we will tell more about the Frankfurt data center. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Telehouse Frankfurt is connected to Europe's second largest Internet Exchange Point, the <a href="https://www.de-cix.net/">DE-CIX</a> , which provides premium services and is the world's leading interconnection platform, providing peak traffic at speeds of more than six terabits per second.  Cooperation with several hundreds of international Internet providers makes it an ideal tool for collaboration of fast-growing transnational corporations, small and medium enterprises that need a reliable access point in the most secure place near the largest center of the European economy.  General official information about Telehouse Frankfurt can be read in the <a href="https://www.telehouse-rechenzentrum.de/wp-content/uploads/Telehouse-Brochure-2018_screen.pdf">presentation</a> . <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Security</font> </h2><br>  As the theater begins with a hanger, so the data center begins with the "house" territory.  Here everything is serious and German succinctly.  The object is surrounded by a seemingly insignificant fence, which, however, is equipped with a modern detection system.  Video surveillance is carried out not only in the courtyard, but also outside the territories, and in the data center premises with permanent recording and storage of records for three months.

This is a multi-tier data center to meet a wide range of customer requirements.  In addition to providing colocation services with racks, cages and separate server rooms, it allows you to build a dedicated data center for customers in its territory.  That is, Telehouse itself generally corresponds to the level of reliability of TIER 3, but additionally it has available (the company constantly focuses on this adjective, which its information materials abound with) local areas for the construction of private data centers corresponding to the level of TIER 4. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38e/545/abc/38e545abc125c7367c1e0c675d0ae22c.jpg"></div><br>  Telehouse Frankfurt operates the largest data center campus in Frankfurt, a city telecommunications hub with a large number of operators and providers.  The campus includes 3 data centers that have access to DE-CIX - the leading Internet exchange in Central and Eastern Europe.  In November 2013, Telehouse Frankfurt's data center became a partner of <a href="https://www.de-cix.net/en/access/the-apollon-platform">DE-CIX Apollon</a> , offering customers direct access to their platform, which makes Telehouse Frankfurt the best choice for international operators who seek to integrate data centers into their communication network.  What we have used.  Server hardware is installed in a 19-inch individually closed rack cabinet.  The allocated personal space (up to 900 m <sup>2</sup> ) is enclosed in cages, built according to individual customer specifications. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/280/edc/876/280edc876a62e3b6c5b608e07507b947.jpg"></div><br>  The DE-CIX Apollon platform in Frankfurt is the first of its kind.  It uses ADVA FSP 3000 and Infinera CloudExpress 2 optical networks for the optical backbone, as well as Nokia‚Äôs new generation service routers (formerly Alcatel-Lucent) for the 7950 XRS and 7750 SR IP network.  The optical backbone has a total capacity of 48 terabits per second in the mesh network topology and provides a transmission rate of up to 8 terabits per second per fiber.  DE-CIX Apollon provides three-to-one redundancy: all four cores work, one for redundancy only.  More information about the system can be found in the <a href="https://www.de-cix.net/Files/dec905f3bbff6a989a285da35d31e5a99095ff9a/Melzer-Schr%25C3%25B6der-Look-behind-the-scenes---Technology-Updates-from-DE-CIX.pdf">technical presentation</a> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e0d/a37/da0/e0da37da0137dbe00c1596db317dfb73.png"></div><br>  DE-CIX is proud to be the first IX in history to introduce a fully automated robot patch: Patchy McPatchbot.  This optical distribution frame (ODF) is used instead of the standard rack and patch panel and significantly increases the efficiency of interaction with customers.  Now the port can be deployed or upgraded within a few minutes without the need for physical intervention of a technical specialist.  In 2018, in the Frankfurt campus, during real-time operation, more than 450 customers were transferred from one data center to another.  In this case, about 15 kilometers of fiber-optic cable was laid.  Over 40% of all data traffic on the world's leading Internet exchange was carried forward without a hitch. <br><br>  Look at Patchy McPatchbot in this video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1GKaPKRggBM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Connectivity: <br><br><ul><li>  Operator-independent, giving customers the freedom to choose to connect with access to several large local and international network operators. </li><li>  Optimal connection to the German Internet Exchange hub (DE-CIX). </li><li>  Direct connection to the fiber optic ring in Frankfurt. </li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/201/671/3ae/2016713aeee2c1f0127ad4516b74c933.jpg"></div><br>  In a business continuity center with 300 workstations for backing up business operations, you can rent an office and storage space of various sizes integrated into the overall Telehouse security system. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3f9/b3a/d61/3f9b3ad61099ab6dece4719e07db8209.jpg"></div><br>  Telehouse customers in Frankfurt can benefit from KDDI's technological expertise in the form of global information and communication technology (ICT) consulting services. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Performance, reliability and pro power supply system</font> </h2><br>  Telehouse uses two independent power supplies that are connected to two separate substations.  Combined with proprietary uninterruptible power systems and emergency generators, Telehouse provides the highest level of uptime and reliability. <br><br>  Redundant power supplies are arranged according to the scheme of the UPS N + 1 with a backup battery.  Uninterrupted emergency power up to 21 MVA.  Power distribution is carried out in accordance with the requirements of the customer with separate measurements.  In the absence of electricity, the data center can remain fully operational for three days through diesel generators. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b55/d4d/490/b55d4d490d97d00755ba099833c739be.jpg"></div><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñç Environment and conditioning</font> </h3><br><ul><li>  Redundant air conditioning and refrigeration systems on N + 1 </li><li>  The room temperature is maintained at 24 ¬∞ C </li><li>  The temperature in the data center is controlled by sensors </li><li>  Relative humidity from 50% to 15% </li><li>  Bearing capacity of the floor from 5 to 15 kN / m <sup>2</sup> </li><li>  Raised floor 300-700 mm </li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ad5/081/896/ad508189614f3be9d038f99c2c793c0c.png"></div><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñçFire detection and extinguishing</font> </h3><br><ul><li>  Visual / thermal fire alarm on two levels (ceiling and raised floor) </li><li>  Active inergenic fire extinguishing systems </li><li>  Option: early fire detection (RAS system) </li><li>  The choice between rooms with active or passive fire protection </li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6fe/0ba/4e5/6fe0ba4e5a74a0d74cf9ac7824599181.jpg"></div><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñçCertificates</font> </h3><br>  Telehouse Frankfurt complies with the Tier 3 classification with additional multi-level selected areas.

They are focused primarily on the corporate segment: government agencies, banks, stock market players.  RUVDS also has its own TIER III data center in Korolev (Moscow region), pressure zones at Interxion data centers in Zurich (Switzerland), Equinix LD8 in London (United Kingdom), and MMTS-9 in Moscow (Russia), Linxdatacenter in St. Petersburg (Russia), IT Park in Kazan (Russia), Data Center Ekaterinburg (Russia).  All germozones respond to a level of reliability not lower than TIER III, and high speed and flexible tariff plans make the service attractive to customers. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ba/550/d25/1ba550d25e8846ce8805de564da6aa63.png"></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/451876/">https://habr.com/ru/post/451876/</a></p>
