But in the computer age, the volume of international trade in shares has increased so much that now all transactions are electronically transmitted through firms that in English are referred to as clearing.  They store information about the owners. <br><br>  The largest of these is DTCC in New York, which controls all of the relevant firms and holds almost 99% of the US shares and, possibly, 99% of the world‚Äôs shares on its behalf, according to some sources.

      This company is a subsidiary of the Federal Reserve, which is owned by a handful of private bankers, as you know. <br><br>  To give you an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe size of operations, DTCCs work in the USA and in 110 other countries.  In 2008, DTCC registered transactions in the amount of 1.88 quadrillion (1.880.000.000.000.000) dollars.  I may have forgotten a few zeros, because I don‚Äôt know if we are talking about a short quadrillion (15 zeros) or a long one (24 zeros) ... In the end, it doesn‚Äôt matter. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  DTCC is a trusted banking campaign (Banking Trust Company) and, in accordance with the law, it does not have the right to have its own shares.  They are owned by its subsidiary, CEDE &amp; Co. <br><br>  If you have stocks, such as gold mines or silver mines, you have nothing if you do not ask for a certificate.  The demands of his extradition are extremely annoying to the bankers, who view the petitioners as immigrants from the Stone Age and these requests are burdensome for them.  However, this is the only way to secure your investment. <br><br>  Those who were interested in the history of the terrorist attack in New York on September 11 know that all investigations related to the manipulation of the FBI and the financial structures of the CIA with gold were stopped on September 11, 2001.  All documents, all reports of investigations, all evidence, all evidence disappeared when the towers of the shopping center fell. <br><br>  <b>Hurricane Sandy (October 2012)</b> <br><br>  After Hurricane Sandy, the DTCC announced that its vaults in the basements had been flooded and many documents destroyed.  Documents testifying to OTC swaps, or OTC swaps.  OTC means ‚ÄúOver the Counter‚Äù in Russian ‚Äúhand washes‚Äù, ‚Äúconfidential‚Äù or ‚Äúbribes‚Äù.  These are exchanges between two financial or non-financial companies that do not pass through the market.  This applies to many types of contracts.  But you can bet that these over-the-counter swaps are related to the manipulation of precious metals prices and that they disappeared under the false pretext of flooding the storehouse. <br><br>  The largest intermediary company of this kind in the world has warehouses that have no chance of being flooded.  Not the slightest.  This is 200% nonsense. <br><br>  The CFTC (US State Market Control Company) investigation will likely be blocked for this contrived cause. <br><br>  The CFTC is still ignorant of what can be damaged or destroyed.  An article in the New York Post talks about an armored cave with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã10,000 m2, where 1.3 million stock certificates, bonds and property rights float in the mud.  It is a question of bearer bonds of 70 billion dollars.  These are documents on good old paper and anonymous in addition, which is so convenient for laundering dirty money.  For the CFTC, which, like all clearing houses, is the center of money laundering (remember the Clearstream case), this story is in the ‚Äúrinse‚Äù phase.  Who will rinse?  We will never know that. <br><br>  This is exactly what Imran Hossein suggests.  He did not hesitate to say out loud that an investigation was conducted among insurers, and there were found suspicious insurance contracts signed before Sandy, where the perpetrators and all their accomplices were identified.  But if the official investigation of September 11 is stuck in a quagmire, so as not to pour dirt on the internal and external forces responsible for this catastrophe, then what about the investigation of a typical tropical storm? <br><br>  <b>Billions of bearer bonds may be lost due to Hurricane Sandy</b> <br><br>  This is the biggest mystery on Wall Street. <br><br>  Hurricane Sandy flooded an underground storage area of ‚Äã‚Äã10,000 square feet in the center of the city, infusing 1.3 million bonds and stock certificates, including bearer bonds that function like cash, and putting them at risk of becoming porridge. <br><br>  The warehouse owner, Trust Depository and Clearing Corporation, is working feverishly to rebuild the paper. <br><br>  But the value of threatened banknotes under 55 Water St.  remains unknown to all but the innermost circle of Wall Street bankers. <br><br>  One source said that 70 billion dollars bearer bonds were at risk. <br><br>  DTCC, the depositary controlled by the largest financial firms on Wall Street, will not say exactly what was in its vaults, how much banknotes cost, and who owns them. <br><br>  Most of the member companies, including Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, UBS and Citi, did not answer calls. <br><br>  The exception was Goldman Sachs, whose representative Michael DuValli confirmed on Friday to The Post that his firm had held bearer bonds in DTCC depositories.  He admitted that it was almost impossible to buy them back if they were destroyed. <br><br>  Yesterday morning, DuVally developed and said that the cost of Goldman bonds is "less than $ 1 million."  An hour later, he called back and said: "The potential impact on the market value of bearer bonds is less than $ 10,000." <br><br>  DTCC spokeswoman Judy Inosanto would only say that ‚Äúvarious stocks and bonds‚Äù were damaged.  ‚ÄúI can't get into the details.  We do not provide value for security reasons. ‚Äù <br><br>  Even the contractor who bid for the cleaning and restoration work ‚Äî the notes were flooded with diesel water and sewage water that filled three basements on Water Street 55, said he was asked about the damage. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt does not concern anyone,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúThe public does not need to know what is in this repository.  It is between them and their customers. ‚Äù <br><br>  It is known that for decades millions of bearer bonds were stored in the vault, the cost of which was many times higher than the amount in dollars.  According to DTCC reports, in 1990, two thirds of the 32 million notes in the vault were bearer bonds.  Despite the fact that the bearer bonds matured and the notes were removed, the vault continued to hold 5.4 million bearer bonds at the end of 2003. <br><br>  Experts say that the only hope for saving bundles of bonds is to dry them in a cold vacuum chamber.  When the air pressure in the chamber decreases and the heat increases, the moisture in the documents evaporates. <br><br>  The security service would have to watch over the tough chain of guardianship during the procedure, and the whole process could cost more than $ 2 million. <br><br>  Belfor, a Texas-based rebuilding firm, is rumored to have won this job yesterday at a parking lot at about 55 Water St.  When asked about the $ 70 billion bond contract with Goldman, Belfor spokesman Alex Gort said: "We have very strict confidentiality." <br><br>  Yesterday, Belfor workers at the site described ‚Äúfull restoration work‚Äù under a ‚Äúvery high level of security,‚Äù but said they knew nothing about the bonds. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThere are three vaults,‚Äù said the defender outside the building.  ‚ÄúI was not in the vault where the bonds are located.  Security there is very tough.  I know that they were all under water.  Billions of dollars soaked.  I know they are trying to pack them. <br><br>  Bearer bonds are paper certificates, usually issued by governments, which are subject to redemption upon the expiration of a fixed period.  The submitter provides an attached coupon for payment.  Since they are usually not registered and can be used as cash, they were usually used by those who wanted to hide assets and not pay taxes on them.  They were banned in 1982. <br><br>  But those that were not fully bought out remain in circulation. <br><br>  Andrew Kintzinger, a securities lawyer, said that if a Wall Street firm held bonds as custodian for investors, there would be electronic records documenting payments that would provide investors with proof of ownership. <br><br>  But if Goldman or other banks own the damaged bonds themselves, their redemption could be a ‚Äúproblem,‚Äù he said. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/447950/">https://habr.com/ru/post/447950/</a></p>
