  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Viewability is the next metric to replace the CTR?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The modern advertising industry is fully focused on visibility.  This is the most pressing question today - how important is such a criterion as viewability. <br><br>  Of course, finding an ad in the user's field of view is an important factor.  However, we must avoid turning this metric into a regular CTR.  You need to understand that, like a click, an ad located in the visible part of the screen is a rather crude success criterion.  In fact, this is just a starting point.  So try not to fall into the trap, in which all decisions are based on the level of visibility of advertising.  If you do, you will be very disappointed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/075/21f/1c2/07521f1c2d0d45478346acce6f8c08f3.jpg">

      A visible ad impression is defined as one that is related to the ad that the user sees.  You can measure the visibility of advertising, <a name="habracut"></a>  using different standards: it can be 50% of the banner area visible for 1 second (IAB standard) or 65% of the banner area that is viewed within 6 seconds (GroupM standard). <br><br>  <b>All views are different.</b> <br><br>  By optimizing their media buying, relying solely on this new metric, market players, as a rule, remain dissatisfied with the results obtained.  It turns out that contextual categories such as adult content and gaming have the highest visibility indicators!  In addition, just as clickthrough rates artificially increased due to pop-up advertising messages, many sites today are designed in such a way as to maximize such an indicator as viewability. <br><br>  A new era is coming, in which only ‚Äúvisible‚Äù advertisements can be found.  Therefore, you need to be prepared for the viewability to receive the status of an autonomous metric. <br><br>  <b>Focusing solely on viewability - the way to fraud</b> <br><br>  Fraudsters are very closely monitoring all the "movements" of the market and try every time to quickly move to a new level.  Just as pay-per-click advertising and the obsession with CTR spawned a clickfroot, the emphasis on visibility of advertising has become the source of a new type of fraud - scammers are now starting to operate on so-called ‚Äúvisible advertising displays.‚Äù  And this is just an incredibly fertile environment for the prosperity of fraud, because bots view ads more often than people.  This type of scam is much more difficult to identify than a clickfrod. <br><br>  A study of click-fraud using bots, conducted by the Association of National Advertisers (ANA) in collaboration with White Ops, suggests that in 2015 bots will ‚Äústeal‚Äù about 6.3 billion dollars from advertisers. <br><br>  ‚Äú <i>When we look at the top 100 best sites, what do we see?</i>  <i>90% or so of them are characterized by a rather low level of bot traffic</i> , ‚Äùsays Gian Fulgoni, honorary chairman and co-founder of ComScore.  ‚ÄúBut when we start to study the site more closely, breaking it up into separate sections, it turns out that half of them have an average or even a high level of fraudulent traffic.  One can officially declare that half of the largest publishers have serious problems both with fraud and with the appearance of advertising. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>The marriage of quality and visibility</b> <br><br>  So what's next?  The visibility or ‚Äúvisibility‚Äù of the advertisement will play one of the first violins.  And the industry will focus on the quality of the impact of an ad (ad exposure).  Market players will focus on such a metric as the actual display of advertising.  Who needs just the fact that the ad is loaded into the browser? <br><br>  The advertiser will be interested in the quality of the advertising contact - the actual number of contacts the audience has with the advertising medium. <br>  Google provides its customers with a tool such as viewable CPM.  It allows advertisers to pay only for those impressions that are defined as visible.  <b>‚ÄúViewable‚Äù are those ads, 50% of which are in the user's field of view for one second or longer for banners and two seconds or longer for video ads.</b> <br><br>  Targeting technologies and advertising performance measurement will need to take into account only measurable factors associated with each advertising display.  Without this, media buyers face purchases of low-quality or even unsafe inventory.  Quality includes many critical aspects, including the size of the ad relative to the viewing window, the relevance and nature of the content of the site where the ad is displayed, etc. <br><br>  At the same time, there is a big difference between the quality of a visible ad and the quality of a visible video ad.  The video tells the whole story, and in such advertising there are many additional factors that are crucial for understanding the effectiveness of the ad.  Among them, the degree of completeness of viewing the video, automatic playback and the size of the video player.  With the increasing complexity of advertising increases the difficulty of measuring its visibility. <br><br>  In the near future, measuring the quality of an ad in terms of viewability will play a decisive role.  Therefore, it is necessary to start now to look closely at these metrics so that later you do not find yourself in the market rearguard. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297468/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297468/</a></p>
