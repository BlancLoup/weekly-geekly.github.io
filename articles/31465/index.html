An extraneous place makes it possible to temporarily relieve pressure from the family and from the authorities.  According to Oldenbeg, this idea corresponds to the Freudian concept of happiness - ‚Äúwhen there is a beloved person and favorite work‚Äù, only with a more realistic shade: ‚Äúto work when no one is buying you up.‚Äù <br><br>  Since the days of Oldenb√∂g, BEING SPACES have become a developed commercial sector, among the players of which, for example, Starbucks, which actively installs thousands of BEING SPACES all over the planet, each of which is equipped with comfortable chairs, tables and WiFi.  Starbucks networks seep into supermarkets and hospitals, cinemas and hotels, universities and libraries, airports and other public places.  And, as you know, each new trend is just an unusual way to meet ordinary needs.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="http://www.paragraphny.com/">The Paragraph</a> (‚ÄúAffordable and Non-Tensioning Workspace for Writers of All Stripes‚Äù) is located in New York.  Its territory includes premises for work and a recreation area.  In the working room there are 38 separate work tables, and in the recreation area there is a kitchen, a large round table and several small coffee tables.  There is also a fridge, microwave, toaster and coffee maker.  There is a laser printer and, of course, wifi.  The restaurant is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. <br><br>  To obtain a membership of the club, it is not necessary to have author publications, but rather a strong desire to write.  Monthly fees range from $ 80 to $ 132.  Now the club has about 120 participants. <br><br>  The Canadian <a href="http://www.thecoffeeoffice.com/">The Coffee Office</a> (TCO) provides everything you need to work productively outside your office.  The part of the building that belongs to the cafeteria is open to anyone, equipped with high-speed free internet and plenty of sockets. <br><br>  The remainder of the premises is reserved exclusively for TCO members, who are provided with individual personal spaces and meeting rooms.  For $ 90 per month, each member of the club can use the desktop, a place to relax and get 25 cups of coffee in addition.  Meeting rooms cost $ 35 and $ 50 per hour, small and large, respectively, and an individual work bay of $ 5 / hour.  Here you can take a nap, using the sleeping module for $ 10 / hour.  Other services include soundproofing during confidential conversations, as well as a call to a specialist from the <a href="http://www.nerdsonsite.com/">Nerd On Site service</a> , who helps solve any technical difficulties in working with a computer. <br><br>  The prospect of such a business is confirmed by the research of The Yankee Group, according to which, in the United States alone, 50 million people - about 38 percent of the total working population - belong to ‚Äúmobile employees‚Äù, that is, those who spend at least 20 percent of their working time office.  These are unsuited freelancers, temporary contractors, minipreneurs, and other people who need flexible working conditions. <br><br>  The listed <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/worldwebstudio/67061.html">coworking</a> clubs have one common limitation - they are good, but only if you are not burdened with family, children or you have, where to leave them while you are engaged in work.  And what if you are a business woman with a child and a laptop in your arms? <br><br><img alt="TwoRooms" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5" src="http://www.springwise.com/newsletters/feb06/twoRooms.gif">  <a href="http://www.tworooms.net/">TwoRooms</a> (‚ÄúYou work, they play‚Äù) is another New York club that combines work space, a playground and a community of other freelancers with children. <br><br>  Two Rooms, as the name suggests, provides two rooms: one for parents and the other for children.  Wireless Internet is everywhere, a printer, copier, fax machine and scanner are available.  In the kitchen, adults can quietly chat.  The center offers several schedules for the provision of services and everyone can choose what is more convenient for him - a full-fledged kindergarten, a temporary workplace, or both in one bottle. <br><br>  Children are accepted from 3 months to 4 years.  Two Rooms can accommodate simultaneously 21 children and 21 adults.  Children rage in a completely separate room, where there is a special room for babies, and even (although all this is located in Manhattan, where there is a lot of space with free space) there is a small courtyard for outdoor games. <br><br>  The annual membership fee is $ 150.  Plus a fee for use from $ 7 to $ 14 per hour. <br><br>  <b>Translation from English:</b> <br>  <a href="http://studio-bloger.livejournal.com/profile">Roman Rabwe</a> for <a href="http://worldwebstudio.livejournal.com/">worldwebstudio.livejournal.com</a> <br><br><br> <a href="http://bobrdobr.ru/addext.html" title="Save page on the service bookmarks Bobrdobr.Ru!"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d3f/3da/f9e/d3f3daf9ed4fc58772af24c97c1dadea.gif" width="80" height="15" align="left" alt="Save page on the service bookmarks Bobrdobr.Ru!"></a> <a href="http://memori.ru/link/" title="Remember this page!"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ef2/1eb/45d/ef21eb45ddd5949e535cb8f104e202fe.gif" align="left" hspace="5" width="80" height="15" title="Remember this page!"></a> <a href="http://del.icio.us/post"><img alt="Save page on del.icio.us bookmarks service" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/89a/8d8/e0c/89a8d8e0c885c0b7e4c30ca574332637.gif"></a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31465/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31465/</a></p>
