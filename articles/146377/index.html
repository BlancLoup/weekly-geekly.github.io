It is the normal lessons and lectures related to one program course, and not training manuals for the Unified State Exam.  How can the Soviet education system look like in modern media?  Who will do it? <br><br>  In the final third post, which will be published later, I will present my thoughts on the estimated costs of developing materials for a full school course in physics.

      Another interesting topic for discussion can be interactivity of educational materials and online interaction between teacher and student. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Comments to the first part of the article </h4><br>  I left a lot of comments without an answer, in the hope that the answer will be heard in this part.  Many questions were from the category of "what is the purpose of education" and "what is considered good and what is bad."  It is difficult for me to discuss this topic, since I take the following principles for axioms: <br>  1. The school should give the widest possible outlook. <br>  2. The school promotes respect for knowledge and an adequate assessment of the world.  Learn to think and reason. <br>  3. The school should not torment, but must inspire. <br>  (I note that I do not write anything about what should be fun at school) <br><br><h4>  Mini-review of types of video lectures </h4><br>  To begin with, what should be a school lecture.  Obviously, there are lecturers who say so interestingly that everyone is listening to the mouth.  Others are practically silent, they only steer the discussion in the right direction in the classroom and the students themselves reach the necessary conclusions.  I am afraid that there is no single recipe.  Therefore, I focus exclusively on the format of online lectures. <br><br>  I think everyone has seen any video tutorials, webcasts, recordings of reports.  Many listened (or at least started listening) lecture courses at MIT, Stanford, and so on.  Next, I want to give examples of the three main types of information delivery through video and note their features. <br><br><h5>  <i>Next comes a lot of videos that are not completely worth watching.</i>  <i>I advise you just click on the middle to get a general idea.</i> </h5><br><h5>  TV shows and TV shows </h5><br>  Imagine any NASA movie about stars, or a BBC movie about animals.  They are large-scale, beautiful, they want to watch.  In addition, they are sold commercial product.  But!  How much do we have new knowledge from them in the dry residue?  We will be told some interesting facts, but we will not know anything that does not fit the time taken by the film.  They will tell us that in Africa the rivers are wide, and the turtles are old, but unfortunately, that is all. <br><br>  Stephen Hawking wrote in his bestseller: ‚ÄúI was told that each formula included in the book would halve the number of customers.  Then I decided to do without formulas at all.  True, in the end I did write one equation - the famous Einstein equation E = mc¬≤. ‚Äù <br><br>  An excellent example of pseudoscience (or nedosnauki) on TV is the show ‚ÄúMythbusters‚Äù, where presenters like to boast that they are ‚Äúlove science‚Äù.  I will make a reservation that the show was perfectly filmed, and I revised it a lot.  I discuss its educational component. <br><br>  Episode about non-Newtonian fluid. <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/5GWhOLorDtw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiXn3tL8hO1M__HtDAsPNb72wA0Zg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The duration is 270 seconds, of which only 15 are about the effect physics (from 2:42), the rest of the time is shown by presenters receiving ecstasy from what is happening.  Good proportions, is it true? <br><br>  The disclosure of the same topic in the program "Galileo": <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/unfbSxDLYi4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhi4P9oVF6-kNqzCeogOYBc3wu7z3A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Here we have more experiments, more explanations, fewer close-ups of presenters with happy faces.  But again the task is dismantled only superficially, at a qualitative level. <br><br>  And now the Pyryshkin Physics Textbook for the 7th grade (the first year of teaching physics), page 22. <br>  <i>(click to enlarge)</i> <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/MdNHqYq4zhx2ttbM1_6WIAzfng8MB98wlUSlnmt7xtQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/4fa/003/5f2/4fa0035f2a57740eeb5ff658b12a8d6a.jpg" height="400" width="311"></a> <br>  The wetting effect is discussed.  This, of course, is not a non-Newtonian fluid, but appreciate the depth of the discussion of physics.  And I remind you that this is the 22nd page of an ordinary first year textbook! <br><br>  <b>Conclusion.</b>  Television shows and full-length popular science films on a commercial basis give the viewer what he wants.  But the viewer does not know what he wants.  This is akin to McDonalds - we need to fatter and sharper, and that with a toy inside.  Otherwise, we, you know, do not eat.  But if in the field of catering, enlightenment comes with the first pain in the abdomen, then with poor-quality pseudo-education, everything ends up where it is sadder. <br><br><h5>  Video recording of lectures at the blackboard </h5><br>  In the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/146304/">comments</a> to the previous article, I was pointed at a MIT professor named Walter Lewin.  This is a promotional video of his course. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Zc9Nuoe2Ow&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjAf7f1AOLxEhy3GlN_m3rPrKrDxA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Pay attention to how important it is for them to have an entertainment component.  I watched his lecture in its entirety and in it, such tricks take ~ 10% of the time.  But still are an essential part. <br><br>  Another example, a lecture shot in SZTU: <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/U3I_FuliqsA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiZ_6p_ke9pPPRBlkrbFRIKVGkmnA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  (100 thousand views, 300 likes, 10 dislikes) <br><br>  Or one more commercial domestic example: <a href="http://eftsh.ru/">eftsh.ru</a> (Electronic FTSH) <br>  They, for example, have a 9th grade math course divided into 7 topics, each of which is 490 rubles each.  And the lessons are the usual reading of the text facing the blackboard, which I observed myself at school for 11 years and, in fact, pleased with the result: <br>  <a href="http://eftsh.ru/maths/course/uravneniya/">eftsh.ru/maths/course/uravneniya</a> (video at the bottom of the page). <br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> <br>  0. These records are extremely popular! <br>  1. It seemed to me irrational to spend screen time on the process of writing the formula on the chalkboard by the professor.  However, after interviewing acquaintances, I was surprised to find that many like it, since they manage to feel the outlines then.  That is a plus in that the lecture is as close as possible to the classical version, to which everyone is already accustomed.  It would be interesting to arrange a survey among seventh graders, what they prefer. <br>  2. Easy to implement, no need to adapt the course.  You can just come to the lesson and start shooting. <br><br><h5>  Webcasts, productions </h5><br>  ‚ÄúSemiconductors, IX class, physics‚Äù, presumably the 72nd year: <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/BrXEhjMHh3M%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgTVoSZDIvt0xmviEjc6mwOxZ7X3w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Think about it, 40 years ago in the USSR understood the need for such commercials.  According to my mom, she watched this movie in Dushanbe Secondary School No. 49 almost at exactly the 72nd.  She also remembers how they were shown videos with instructions for cleaning fish.  Similar views were held regularly. <br><br>  Also 72nd year, oscillations: <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1hZNFct9jQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgi_iSDkl1dWghnTeo50H79DngtDA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  And this is Khan Academy about the same after almost 40 years. <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nk2q-_jkJVs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiqzdRz5y_PbuCcK1lRMxQhS-W2Pw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  We will not focus on a slightly different level (yet another country, another millennium), but look at the presentation of the material.  Agree, the Soviet film is much better.  He's just better directed. <br><br>  I will give one more example.  Soviet film about what the universe consists of (presumably the 1970s): <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2TPB7pFr5c%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhi0m7vYz12k-N0BmFRJ93efx6bbIg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  American counterpart (1977): <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/0fKBhvDjuy0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhi_3k03vTGmwJZs4MdRMZRn9HL6Tw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Both in the USA and in the USSR they were thinking in the same direction. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> <br>  1. ‚ÄúEverything has already been stolen!‚Äù <br>  2. To shoot such videos is more difficult than recording a lecture on video.  However, their potential is much greater. <br>  3. The last example shows that at a time when states were interested in the general education of the population, preference was given to this format rather than just lecture notes. <br><br><h4>  What to do? </h4><br>  Lectures are required containing a fully school course, which could potentially replace the school (at least its lecture part).  The basis of the course to take on any textbook, time-tested. <br><br>  They should look like thoughtful videos with video inserts and animations.  All this has already been done in the USSR.  For example, here are 10 consecutive lectures on atomic physics for the tenth grade <a href="http://shorttext.com/O6egrT">magnet (torrent)</a> .  They are filled with Soviet propaganda, but otherwise quite modern.  It is worth updating a few examples. <br><br>  In other words, do not reinvent the wheel.  The school curriculum includes sciences that have changed little over the past half century.  You can simply refresh the available materials!  Arrange them and make a convenient platform to access them. <br><br><h4>  Who will do this? </h4><br>  As I imagine it can be implemented, for example, in St. Petersburg.  To prepare the course, for example, for the 7th grade in physics and mathematics, we will need a troika of experienced teachers from the best schools who could agree on a course program in a month, a sequence of presentation.  Then, three graduate students and young scientists who would breathe life into the course should take up the material.  They will insert a paragraph about the Large Hadron Collider into the right place, or it will be mentioned about the hype with superluminal neutrinos.  Add something modern that everyone has heard.  The last stage is a triple: designer, animator, installer.  They are already brought to the presentation.  Details on how I see the total work, the next time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146377/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146377/</a></p>
