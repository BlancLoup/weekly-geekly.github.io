  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Who is smarter is right? Hacker's Notes part 3 of 5</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In previous issues, I told the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/infosecurity/86880/">story of the failure of the championship in the computer club</a> and the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/infosecurity/86887/">magical SysRq in Sunrise</a> , from the first one you can draw my motives and information about the real sources of these stories. <br>  So, we will not repeat, and I immediately turn to the third ballad from the cycle, about provider Gorbin, until I was completely zaminusovali. <br><br>  My friend was connected to the local "home network" for several years when Gorbin came to his area. <br>  It so happened that the local network at that time had major problems with communication, and he decided to connect to Gorbin in order to know everything in comparison. <br>  And I went to visit him, pick up the disc, and at the same time evaluate the delights of the new provider. <br><br>  What was my surprise when the ettercap managed to catch some kind of snmp-package, from which it was clear - someone in Gorbin decided not to change the default snmp-community ‚Äúprivate‚Äù. <a name="habracut"></a>

      It was possible to extinguish and raise ports, receive information on interfaces, a table of MAC addresses ... <br>  Looking ahead, I can say that you could even send a snmp request in order for the switch to merge its config to the tftp server. <br><br>  The first step is to build a network map, focusing on fdb-table data.  After all, I did not want to accidentally cut myself off from the rest of the world. <br>  Within a few hours, the scale of the disaster became clear - 4 segments of 20 houses each. <br>  How to put them all? <br><br>  The solution was found original - I damaged the original firmware for the switch, right in the binary editor.  Hoping that the checksum will match, or the switch will not pay attention to it.  Raised from a friend tftp server.  And he began to send commands to the switch so that he updated this fake firmware from our server.  From the third time - a ride!  The switch was capturing the firmware, and, apparently, did not get up anymore. <br><br>  Further, within a few hours, from the farthest "leaves" of our tree, to us - the root, all the switches of the Gorbin provider in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãmy friend were "updated". <br>  The next 3 days a friend observed in the area a huge number of installers Gorbina with huge backpacks over his shoulders. <br><br>  What do you think was in the backpacks?  That's right, new switches.  The hornback is so powerful that in a few days it has completely restored everything.  And a friend continued to use it, in the end. <br><br>  In the following issues of "who is smarter than he is right," you can wait for: "a provider who has forgotten to remove the demo.php file from the standard spaw delivery" and "a small provincial provider and a thunderstorm to order." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86912/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86912/</a></p>
