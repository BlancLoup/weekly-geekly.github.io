We expect that the new features of the project will make it much better. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  A little about the history of the project </h3><br>  The modx.ru site appeared in June 2006.  The only owner of the project at that time was Maxim Korinets, [ <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/yentsun/" class="user_link">yentsun</a> ], better known in the MODX community under the name Yentsun.  Thanks to this person, the basic description of the still very young project modx.com was translated, the design was made, and some of the functionality came almost to the end of the first version.  Thank you, Maxim!  Without you there would not be this project at all. <br><br>  After a while, Maxim left the direct development on MODX and decided to transfer the project under my control.  For a while I continued to develop MODX, but at a certain point in time I realized that I could not keep it up to date alone.

      As MODX ‚Äúveterans‚Äù probably know, the modx.ru website in its former guise has long been morally and physically outdated.  Unfortunately, the last couple of years didn‚Äôt develop at all, which even led to the reasonable demands of some MODX community users to close the project in order not to scare away new users.  It didn‚Äôt take that long, so the decision to stop the project and in any way solve this problem was overdue. <br><br>  Therefore, as a result, the project was completely transferred to the company, where I continue to work, so I am writing this article on behalf of the whole team.  Without the efforts of each member of our company, we would not be able to create a project that we are presenting to you now. <br><br><h3>  New Future MODX.RU </h3><br>  We decided that simply closing the project would be too great a loss for the MODX community, to which we also belong.  Our team loves this management system, and who else, no matter how we, take up the development of the MODX.RU project.  However, to develop the site further in the form in which it was located, did not make any sense anymore.  Therefore, the company held a general brainstorming session, where each employee was able to offer his ideas for a quality update. <br><br>  Starting to discuss the architecture, we realized that on MODX of this level, projects were probably not yet created.  There was a great temptation to use third-party solutions or frameworks.  For example, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing the framework Yii was discussed.  However, the team was firmly convinced that all conceived functionality can and should be implemented using only MODX Revolution. <br><br>  And the work began to boil. <br><br>  So, after many iterations (hundreds of closed tasks in to-do lists) and a long period of site development (more than six months and almost 900 man-hours), we are happy to announce that we did it!  <strong>We have launched the updated modx.ru!</strong> <br><br>  In the new project we tried to implement the most useful from our point of view functionality that will allow users to receive information about MODX CMS in the most convenient and interesting form. <br><br><h3>  About innovations in the project </h3><br>  <strong>1. Informational content</strong> <br><br>  The new portal contains up-to-date information about MODX versions, history and frequently asked questions. Information is translated directly from modx.com with the permission of MODX developers. <br><br>  <strong>2. Authorization on the site</strong> <br><br>  Previously, commenting and many other user actions were anonymous.  In certain cases it is even good, but more often it is not.  Now on the site for commenting, for rating in ratings and other actions will have to log in.  By the way, authorization is allowed through various social networks and OpenID. <br><br>  <strong>3. News and Articles</strong> <br><br>  We decided not to leave the current trend and made it possible to add MODX manuals and news by the users themselves.  In articles, the program code is highlighted automatically. <br><br>  <strong>4. Question-answer</strong> <br><br>  The new rubric for the modx.ru website Question-Answer allows some users to ask their own questions regarding development on MODX, and other users to help them.  This is not a replacement for the previous forums, but we hope that the innovation will become an additional way to get a quick and professional answer to your questions. <br><br>  <strong>5. Site Directory</strong> <br><br>  Previously, the gallery of sites developed by MODX was a catalog of sites without an author.  More precisely, the author was - and his name was indicated - but there was no unambiguous connection between the author and his site.  Often, different authors indicated identical names, which created confusion in the catalog. <br><br>  Now each site will have a unique binding to the profile.  We have tried to transfer all sites (more than a thousand of them!) From the old MODX.RU catalog to the new one, however, for obvious reasons, they have not yet been linked to their authors.  If you have ever added your site to the old catalog, please link them to your new profile - this can be done immediately after authorization on the site. <br><br>  <strong>6. Rating of companies and individual web developers at MODX</strong> <br><br>  The former version of the site modx.ru was often subject to substantiated claims related to the rating of individual sites and their authors.  Previously, the rating was almost entirely dependent only on the perseverance of individual authors :).  Screw it cost almost no effort.  In the new version of the MODX.RU project we tried to correct this problem. <br><br>  Three interdependent components have been implemented: the rating of individual sites with sorting according to different parameters, the rating of web developers and the rating of companies working with MODX.  We understand that ratings are often perceived ambiguously, so we tried to implement a ranking mechanism that seeks maximum objectivity. <br><br>  The real formula for calculating the ratings of web developers and companies turned out to be quite large.  It takes into account such parameters as the total number of user sites, the rating of each user site, its articles, comments and answers to questions, etc.  In addition, over time, the rating will gradually decline. <br><br>  The total rating of companies directly depends on the rating of users who belong to this company. <br><br>  <strong>7. Work on MODX</strong> <br><br>  This is also a new section for MODX.RU, in which customer requests for developing software solutions using MODX CMS are published. <br><br>  We hope that you will enjoy the updated MODX.RU, and guarantee that its improvement will now be permanent.  We still have a lot of plans for the future, and we very much count on users whose ideas we will also try to implement in the project. <br><br>  Thank you for your attention, we are waiting for you on <a href="http://modx.ru/">MODX.RU</a> !  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/193328/">https://habr.com/ru/post/193328/</a></p>
