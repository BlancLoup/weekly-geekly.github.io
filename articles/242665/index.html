  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About the applied aspects of managing people in an organization or where are the children?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We asked our negotiator expert Dmitry Kotkin to share his thoughts on the results of a <a href="http://propeople.stratoplan.ru/pollresults/">large study about working with people</a> .  And the conversation unexpectedly led to the children and the manipulation of companies, as a result of which such a small article was born. <br><br><h4>  Dmitry Kotkin "On the applied aspects of managing people in an organization or where are the children?" </h4><br>  After reading the results of a survey conducted by colleagues from Stratoplan, a logical question arose: <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúAnd why 50% do not like their work, but go to it?‚Äù</b> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

      Throwing away the idea that these 50% percent suffer from masochism, I put forward the idea that someone controls these people, someone who subordinates them to his will.  How else to explain the discrepancy of desires and behavior?  Of course, these people manage cunning manipulation, and one of the ways we will now disassemble. <br><br>  Any employer, top manager, business owner wants to change (and even subordinate) his staff.  He does not like him, because it does not allow him to get the maximum possible profit.  And since the maximum possible profit is difficult to achieve (if not more), then there is always discontent with the employees.  And the manager is trying with all his might to launch changes that increase the effectiveness of what he believes is not working effectively. <br><br>  But how to do that?  Another problem is how to keep an employee who has increased his efficiency in a company, how to do it so that after investing money, effort, time in it, he does not go to competitors? <br><br>  Man's behavior is governed by his inner picture of the world. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What it is?  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587,_%25D0%2590%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD_%25D0%25AF%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">AND I.</a>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587,_%25D0%2590%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD_%25D0%25AF%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">Gurevich</a> defines a picture of the world as a ‚Äúgrid of coordinates‚Äù, through which people perceive reality and build an image of the world that exists in their minds.  In each model of the world there are: <br><ul><li>  ethnic features; </li><li>  universal concepts and categories (time, space, change, reason, fate); </li><li>  specific features of members of a particular social group. </li></ul><br>  If you do not dive into the mire of philosophy, then the <b>picture of the world</b> is our idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow the world around us works and how we should interact with it, and the process of business negotiations is only a small piece, a special case of this interaction. <br><br>  In the picture of the world of primitive man, the Earth was flat and covered with a crystal dome of the sky, the Sun regularly traveled from east to west.  This view, reflected in the mythology of many peoples of the world, was based on the visual perception of the ancient man, on his experience.  Today we know perfectly well that this is not the case, and we believe the story of an elementary school nature teacher, not our personal observations, our eyes, which we stubbornly tell us that the Earth is flat, and the Sun moves across the sky around us, and not vice versa.  Our picture of the world is already different from the picture of the world of our ancestor. <br><br>  Very conditionally, a picture of the world can be represented as an onion, where the core is <u>our sense of self as a person</u> .  We differ from animals in that we can distinguish ourselves from the outside world.  The next level is the <u>system of self-identification</u> , which answers the question: ‚ÄúWho am I in this world?  How do I identify myself, with whom, with what?  How do I want others to see me? ‚Äù  This is a certain image of the ideal self, it may be unrealistic, making its holder blind in interaction with reality, and may be dynamically changing under the influence of life experience and healthy ambitions. <br><br>  The destruction of the system of self-identification, putting it in doubt instantly causes a storm of negative emotions, excites the interlocutor.  For example, in Italy, if you want to mortally insult a man, the easiest way to achieve this is by calling him ‚Äúa cuckold who knows that he is a cuckold‚Äù (in Italian, there is a special word for this).  And in Japan - this is an appeal to a man in the feminine.  In the minds of the Japanese, in the social hierarchy of Japanese society, a woman is much lower than a man, and such a ‚Äúsex change operation‚Äù is very humiliating for the interlocutor.  For Muslims, a dog is the same ‚Äúdirty‚Äù animal as a pig.  Muslims prefer to die under the rubble rather than be rescued by rescue dogs, which is why dogs are not used to rescue people in the event of an earthquake or avalanche in Muslim countries.  Destruction of the system of self-identification is worse than physical death! <br><br>  The next level in the picture of the world is the <u>system of values</u> .  This is the level that our parents first of all form; the value system helps to make a decision in the conditions of your choice.  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãoverdue baby food - is it an art or a crime, swearing in negotiations - is it a deliberate device or lack of restraint?  Each of us has its own scale of values ‚Äã‚Äãthat determines our behavior. <br><br>  For most of the workers in the company, family is in the first place, not the interests of the company's production.  Does the employer use the value of the family in managing, creating an effective organization?  Does the leader think about children ‚Äî the wives of their employees and embed them in the life of the organization? <br><br>  This can be achieved in different ways: family contests, children's rooms in organizations where you can leave a child, family vouchers.  The pumped-up manager will exclaim that it is not the company's task to take care of the employee's family, because the commercial structure is not a charitable organization. <br><br>  But we give examples from real life. <br><br>  <b>An example from life.</b>  A large company, the head of the sales department became pregnant, well, it happens with women.  But as a result of a confluence of circumstances, she ended up in the hospital and lost a child.  When she returned to the organization, her boss forced her to quit, explaining that as an employee, she was no longer.  Now she will think how to get pregnant, and not how to sell more goods to customers.  Fired under a false pretext.  Well, they fired and fired, but this story reached the staff, what do you think happened to his female half, who wanted to get married and have a baby?  No, they did not write statements about dismissal, but they began to quietly hate their ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù organization.  But hate does little to improve the efficiency of the company.  The head did not think what values ‚Äã‚Äãof employees are affected by such a management decision. <br><br>  <u><b>Another life example.</b></u>  In one of the organizations, the wise leader organized an annual corporate celebration, ‚ÄúDay of the Harvest,‚Äù which was held in the fall and a competition was held there, where dishes prepared at home were tasted.  The wives of employees were killed in the kitchen so that the spouse could take their food to work and hit their fellow servicemen.  And then, when the couple went on long business trips, the wives were very loyal to the company, which deprived them of their family holidays.  They did not oppose family values ‚Äã‚Äãto company values. <br><br>  <u><b>New example.</b></u>  A large hydropower plant was built in the Siberian region, people had to be evicted from the flood zone, with minimal financial outlays for the state.  And people did not want to leave their homes, land, graves of parents.  Organizing consultants who were invited to solve this problem approached her from an unexpected angle.  They started working with children.  It seems that children do not make the decision to move.  But it only seems.  What our child wants is for us a powerful motivating incentive for action.  Consultants began to implement a program in which children created the desire to live differently, expanding their picture of the world, showing how to live differently.  And the children encouraged their parents to move.  System, installation changed from inside the system.  Because the value of the family is higher than the value of comfort and habit.  Someone will say that this is contrary to morality, it is manipulation, but the authorities of the region thought differently.  And the money was saved a lot. <br><br>  <u><b>A story about an illiterate teacher</b></u> (another story about influencing family values).  In an elite Moscow school an illiterate primary school teacher appeared.  A good teacher, but who wrote with terrible mistakes.  How he got to school is a separate story.  But when the fact of illiteracy was revealed, the school principal was depressed.  Breaking the contract with the teacher - the situation is not simple, the law is on the side of the worker.  Again, an urgent need to look for a replacement.  After the meeting with the vice principal, it was decided to dismiss the teacher according to the results of the annual dictation.  It was obvious that an illiterate teacher could not teach children grammar and punctuation.  Most likely, students will write a year-old dictation worse than parallel classes, and this will be the basis for dismissal. <br><br>  And the annual dictation, and, oh, horror, the class wrote a dictation an order of magnitude better than the parallel classes.  How?  How? <br><br>  Before I reveal the secret, offer your version ( <u><b>read no further</b></u> ). <br><br>  But it turned out all simple.  After the teacher invited parents to school by writing a phrase like ‚ÄúWorried radar, I invite you to the rabbits sabraniye‚Äù in the students' diaries, the parents clutched at the head.  Having discussed the situation between themselves, they came to the conclusion that something needs to be done, and the only correct decision was made, you need to study Russian with your child on your own.  The results exceeded the expectations of all actors. <br><br>  So let's recapitulate: managing people is built on managing changes in their worldview.  You can learn this, you can reprogram the consciousness of another person, and you can even try to do it.  But remember, we will be rewarded according to our faith and our deeds. <br><br>  ________________________________ <br><br>  PS If it is interesting to get deeper into the field of management and staff relations, then <b>on November 11, at 8:00 pm Moscow time,</b> Dmitry Kotkin will speak at our online conference <b><a href="http://propeople.stratoplan.ru/">PRO + People</a></b> with the topic <b>‚ÄúHead and Slave Interaction‚Äù</b> , which will help you understand who the leader is and how you can manage energy in the work process, as well as talk about the concepts of loyalty and contracting, without which there is no modern team. <br><br>  Participation in the Conference is paid: 980 rubles.  for 5 workshops.
