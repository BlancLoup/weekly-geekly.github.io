Now the money and securities that citizens hold in these accounts will be insured by analogy with ordinary bank deposits.  About what IIS is and how assets on such accounts will be protected - read in our new material. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  What is IIS </h2><br>  IIS is a brokerage account that gives its owner an individual the right to tax benefits of two different types.  Individual investment accounts earned in Russia since January 1, 2015.  At first it was possible to place on them up to 400,000 rubles, but this year the amount increased to 1 million rubles.  with the possibility of adding more than 400,000 rubles.  during two years.

      One of the main reasons for the emergence of a new investment instrument was the aspiration of the state to increase market liquidity ‚Äî it was necessary to attract people to the exchanges who had not traded in them before, but had sufficient funds for that.  Owners of IIS were offered two options for benefits. <br><br>  The first type of exemption - a tax deduction of 13% of the amount paid - is suitable for people who are not going to try themselves as active investors, but simply want to keep their money not ‚Äúat home under the pillow‚Äù. <br><br>  It works this way - if a person in 2017 adds to the account, for example, 400 thousand rubles, then a tax deduction in the amount of 52 thousand rubles (13%) for this year will be returned to him.  Money can be made even in December, and in January to receive a deduction.  At the same time there is no prohibition on investments - you can use money from IIS to trade on the stock exchange, receive profit from it and retain the right to receive the deduction. <br><br>  If the owner of an individual investment account did not receive a deduction, but used the account for trading on the stock exchange, then after three years, the profit from operations on the investment account is exempt from income tax. <br><br>  According to the Moscow Exchange, in the second quarter of 2017, more than 231 thousand such accounts were opened.  Of these, 88 thousand accounts are active, the turnover of IIS on exchange trading during this time was about 20 billion rubles. <br><br><h2>  How insurance will work </h2><br>  According to the plans of the Central Bank, the insurance of securities and money in individual investment accounts will be a special structure, independent of the central bank and the Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA), which protects citizens' deposits in banks.  The new fund will be filled with quarterly contributions from professional market participants (for example, brokers and banks). <br><br>  The insurance will not cover market risks - if the investment brings a loss, no one will compensate for it, but the new system must protect the bankruptcy of a broker or a brokerage bank. <br><br>  The volume of assets on IIS falling under protection will be 1.4 million rubles - by analogy with the terms of deposit insurance.  The introduction of an investment insurance system will attract new retail investors to the market.  In the end, the Central Bank does not want to give advantages to traders over bank depositors. <br><br><h2>  Other materials on finance and stock market from <a href="https://iticapital.ru/">ITI Capital</a> : </h2><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://iticapital.ru/research-education/education/events/">ITI Capital Educational Resources</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://iticapital.ru/research-education/research/">Analytics and market reviews</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/itinvest/blog/246972/">The state will pay citizens for familiarity with the stock market</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/itinvest/blog/277372/">Trading on the exchange in questions and answers: accounts, insurance and comparison with banks</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/itinvest/blog/277058/">Remote opening of a brokerage account through the portal of state services: why and how to do it</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/344070/">https://habr.com/ru/post/344070/</a></p>
