At least it was before the crisis.  A huge number of <strike>charlatans</strike> coaches in Versace suits and fake Patek Philippe watches, plow corporate spaces.  Their services are not cheap and reach 9 thousand dollars for training.  You don't need a lot to make yourself the name of a business coach.  Publish a couple of books and travel around the country for a while.  And now, the name is already heard.  "Ah, this is the same ..." and you can demand high fees. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Now about 80% of the trainings offered on the market are shows.  Pops - almost with songs, dances and guest stars.

      ‚ÄúDo you want more money?" - the coach performs a pirouette in the style of Jim Carrey, and freezes, stretching the microphone to the gym. <br>  - YES!  - the hall explodes. <br>  - Do you want to be happy?  Shouts the trainer, raising his hands to heaven. <br>  - YES-A-A!  - the hall rages. <br>  - Aliluy! <br><br>  Although, the last word is not pronounced by everyone, and not always :).  And now what?  And the crisis, guys.  Although the crisis can be cut down money.  Well, rather we will do a new training.  "Kill-crisis."  Let's change some words from our standard one and get: <br><br>  ‚ÄúDo you want to overcome the <em><strong>crisis</strong></em> ?" - the coach serves in front, and points to the person sitting in the front row. <br>  - YES!  - the audience shouts, following the inspired attention of the business guru - the audience. <br>  - Do you want to be out of <strong><em>crisis</em></strong> ?  - the trainer shouts, quickly running to the other end of the stage and pointing to the next victim. <br>  - YES-A-A!  - all jump up and applaud standing. <br>  - Aliluy!  <em>Oh, I burst out again, I was a part-time worker before training at Witnesses</em> . <br><br>  The show is great, but let's come from the other side.  There are another 20% of normal coaches who teach the results.  Now knowledgeable people recommend buying the result, not training days.  The question arises: how to measure the result?  And it can be measured by the number of tasks to be solved.  And what is the solution to the problem?  This is the key. <br><br>  In our life we ‚Äã‚Äãsolve many problems.  We are looking for answers to questions, and studying the experience of other people.  Did they have similar ones?  How did they solve problems?  And here consultants and trainers come to the rescue. <br><br>  I once heard an interesting idea that consultants are people who offer keys to locks that someone once opened.  It is a pity that our life offers all the time different castles.  Only a common key fits simple locks, and complex ones require the manufacture of their own, and even several different keys.  A simple task is easy.  Often, it‚Äôs enough to look at the Internet in the small tricks section to learn <a href="http://journal.caseclub.ru/2008/07/11/malenkie-xitrosti-ili-sovety-domashnemu-masteru/">how to squeeze the juice with a jack</a> .  <em>Oh, you do not have a jack at hand?</em>  <em>Well, then this key does not suit you.</em>  <em>Search further.</em> <br><br>  The solution of complex business problems is similar to the way through the maze, and the more <a href="http://journal.caseclub.ru/2009/01/03/front-ofis-za-liniej-fronta/">technical</a> .  You pick up the key to one door, and behind it is the second, you hardly open it, and it already seems that the solution is close, but between you and the decision another door is growing, to which none of the keys used is suitable. <br><br>  During his life, the consultant is overgrown with a variety of keys that were used once and came to one lock in a particular situation.  Here comes such a consultant to the client, unleashes a marching consultant bag, and dumps onto the customer's desk a pile of keys, large and small, rusty from lying idle for a long time, and shiny, freshly made, iron and made of 999 gold. <br><br>  ‚ÄúHere,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúwe used this key with such and such a client, this with such and such.  And this one is my favorite.  While we drank it, seven pots got away, but it was worth it.  Here and you will find something. "  And the client believes.  Believes that among this mountain of keys, there is the only one who will solve his problems.  And the consultant begins his trainings of <strike>fairy tales</strike> ... and the result is weak, because he offers <em><strong>other people's</strong></em> keys for solving <em><strong>other people's</strong></em> tasks.  This is not to say that it does not work.  In some cases, the keys are <em><strong>almost</strong></em> suitable, but in most cases they need to "file". <br><br>  In his book Reaching the Maximum, Brian Tracy argues that there is an effective recipe for being successful.  It is only to do what successful people have done, and success will come by itself.  Do not consult consultants?  They say: do as we did there, and you will be just as good.  Which means "use this key and it will open your lock."  I would just paraphrase Brian Tracy's advice, ‚Äústudy what successful people did, learn how they did it, but be prepared for what you need to do differently.‚Äù <br><br>  Old castles no longer exist.  You cannot be at the same time, in the same place, and with the same ideas as successful people ( <em>you cannot drown twice</em> <em>in the same swamp</em> ).  You can only learn their experience, but you will have <strong><em>to make the</em></strong> keys to <em><strong>your</strong></em> locks <strong><em>yourself</em></strong> .  Practice on <strike><a href="http://journal.caseclub.ru/2008/12/20/potrenirujtes-na-koshkax/">cats</a></strike> simple locks, discover them <em><strong>yourself</strong></em> , develop <a href="http://des.caseclub.ru/">new skills</a> in yourself, go from simple to complex, and do not take on trust all that consultants say. <br><br>  PS And what does cabbage mean, you ask?  Yes, despite the fact that the main goal of consultants is not to help your business, but to chop it up, darling :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/48948/">https://habr.com/ru/post/48948/</a></p>
