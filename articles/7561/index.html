I don‚Äôt know if Yandex will succeed in getting people to MyCircle and to the betayar at the same time, because after Odnoklassniki, not many people have a hand to introduce another profile and look for old friends in the new service.  In my opinion, the betayar needs a very clear positioning and, depending on this, a lot of necessary, pleasant and understandable services. <br><br>  Here is the page in betajare: <br> <a href="" title="My page in beta.ya.ru"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/6de/c9d/189/6dec9d189bc075e16eaeab39d7731119.gif" width="300" height="664" alt="My page in beta.ya.ru" hspace="10" vspace="10"></a> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It was just me frantically that before leaving I started looking for EVERYONE and ANYWHERE.  And, to some extent, successfully, because  Today I found two girls and one guy from my class.  If we consider that I didn‚Äôt contact the school after anyone‚Äôs graduation, even for an institute, for me this is nonsense.

      I noticed that I terribly like to write notes in betayar.  However, fearing that the betayar is still not finished with beta service and testing, you have to copy the text to the familiar LJ after writing it, after which the betayar itself sucks it where it should. <br><br>  It is also not clear where he sucks the texts from the blogs - in his database, where you can change and save them, or he puts a link to the text from the blog that is being sucked.  In the latter case, all changes in the blog that occur after the note was already sucked by betayar should be visible in betayar.  If he sucks the text again, in search of changes.  But this moment can be tested. <br><br>  I think it would be good to open access to view profiles of already registered users for everyone.  And many already ponakidili links in the internet to their profiles in betayar, but not local can not see them. <br><br>  From the advantages of the betayar I see the following points: <br><br>  1. the ability to change the color range of their pages; <br>  2. the opportunity to watch friends from any users without restriction, moving as deeply as you like; <br>  3. the ability to contact with all without restrictions, add as a friend (by the way, there are problems in My Circle with this); <br>  4. nice and unloaded with unnecessary functions VIZIVIG-editor (usually rarely use, but I can not tear myself away); <br>  5. nice design (yes, but I like the simple minimalist design of Yandex, although the studio itself doesn‚Äôt particularly hover over the standards in the page layout, and it hurts my eyes right away. Well, all right! nefig here blather); <br>  6. relatively few people, many whom I found here, met in person (a temporary moment, and I looked only friends of friends, and there the same faces. A vicious circle); <br>  7. A bunch of actions, for example, share a link, mood or post a picture.  Very good, * human * presentation of these actions in the diary; <br>  8. I will add one point, because  the service is really good and I liked it, let there be more advantages :-) <br><br>  Of the minuses: <br><br>  1. sometimes the location of a function is not at the place where you are looking for it (usability problem in new services); <br>  2. Some stupid KU, which must be raised (?), Is very annoying.  It is not clear why this thing is needed.  What will happen if she is small, and what changes if she grows up big?  or medium ...; <br>  3. closeness of profiles from viewing by unregistered users; <br>  4. there are few points in the questionnaire (I generally like to fill out very long and interesting forms, such as on Mamba) and it is very inconveniently arranged for reading; <br>  5. no internal mail between users; <br>  6. it is not clear by what principle a large photo on the left side of the title page is changing; <br>  7. In general, setting up a profile, I think, will confuse many * non-advanced * users.  Need to strive for simplicity. <br><br>  PS: By the way, if anyone needs invitations - (in a whisper) I have a few :-) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/7561/">https://habr.com/ru/post/7561/</a></p>
