    <h4>  Prehistory </h4><br>  At the end of last year, I made some money into my iStockphoto account, but at the beginning of this I stopped doing video design without spending the full amount.  Under the license agreement, unspent credits paid off are written off after 1 year.  The year is coming to an end, you need to urgently purchase art, but there is no suitable order. <br><br>  And then I had an idea - I would buy a footwear for a hat for my video mafia.  After going through a few options, he stopped at one, and a little bit different, but not yet needed, left in open tabs. <br><br><h4>  Problem </h4><br>  It was in the morning, porridge in the head, while logged in, checking the balance - confusing the tabs and downloading the wrong file (it has the same beginning as the right one, but the meaning is completely different).  I was upset - I could download the right one only in low quality (there would not be enough credits), and this did not suit me at all.  Of course, you can buy more loans, but it's a shame, because the file I paid for is not needed at all. <br><br>  I decided to write to the author of the file.  He responded quickly, but referred to the terms of the license agreement prohibiting the transfer of files.  He advised to contact support. <br><br><h4>  Decision </h4><br>  Not hoping for a successful solution to the problem, I wrote to the support.  Described the situation and waited.  Usually they answer the next day, but this time about a week has passed.  In a week I receive a letter, in brief I convey the content in my own words: <br><br><blockquote>  No question, download the file in the desired quality and tell us - you will return the loans.  If you have no credits, there are two options: <br>  1. Buy more credits, download the file and contact us for a refund, <br>  2. Call us, we will help you to download the file you need online. <br>  If none of the options is suitable - unsubscribe, we will send you a Cerificate of Destruction.  Sign up, send us and we will return your loans. <br></blockquote><br><br>  I didn‚Äôt want to talk on the phone, I don‚Äôt want to buy loans now either, and asked for a certificate of destruction.  They sent a pdf-file, which I printed out, indicated which files I downloaded, the reason for the return of credits and gave the witness to sign the destruction of the files. <br><br>  The next day, the loans were already on my balance sheet. <br><br>  So if you suddenly inadvertently downloaded the wrong file or, for example, the customer did not pay you for your work, you should know that <b>you can return the money for these files</b> .  Naturally, there must be a good reason for this, each specific case is considered by the support service, and they are entitled to refuse.  But in my case everything turned out very well.  Nice to work with civilized people.  I hope in this country they will also learn to provide quality services. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/107776/">https://habr.com/ru/post/107776/</a></p>
