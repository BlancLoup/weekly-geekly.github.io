The fact that people on the street see only as a fait accompli (electric scooters have become commonplace on the streets of big cities) - I saw from within the community as a long process that began a long time ago and has been developing exponentially over the past year and a half.  I myself in the summer of 2018 dashed off on a light electric scooter almost 2.5 thousand kilometers, feeling all its advantages and saving on the journey (including taxis) the amount of half the monthly salary. <br><br>  So, there is a new process that is not visible from the outside.  People from scooters are transplanted to monocoles.  Migration is strictly in one direction, there is almost no reverse.  To the question "which scooter to choose" in chat rooms they answer not to waste time and immediately choose a wheel.

      <b>The transport of the future is already here, only you have not understood it yet.</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>I will be honest - I rewrote this article several times, deleting the draft with the words "I could not get across" and starting anew.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The fact is that any mention of the monocolaces in the comments (which is on the habre, that on youtube) instantly causes aggression and dislike.</i>  <i>No wonder - just recently, my attitude towards them was also aggressively negative.</i>  <i>‚ÄúI still want to live‚Äù and ‚Äúthis is for acrobats‚Äù - these are my quotes a year ago.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Personal experience turned all the ideas - it became clear why people change one thing to another, and why this process will only intensify further.</i> <br><br><h2>  Nonconformism </h2><br>  The situation can be compared with the mass appearance of ordinary scooters on the streets of Moscow and St. Petersburg.  At first, an adult on the ‚Äúchildren's toy‚Äù provoked disapproval and ridicule.  But such people became more and more - and it became the norm.  An elderly grandmother, who yesterday twisted a finger at her temple after an adult guy on a scooter, at some point comes to the conclusion that it is easier to get to the subway, and since other people do it, she can.  Meanwhile, the aforementioned guy suddenly leaves the corner, balancing on satanic garbage ... History repeats itself in a circle. <br><br>  In the fall of 2018, I accidentally became ‚Äúthe very guy‚Äù, having decided to learn how to ride a mono-wheel just for show.  A few days later I had to buy my own, and put the electric scooter in the closet.  After a week of use, my conclusion was: <br><br>  <b>The monowheel in the role of urban transport puts an electric scooter on the blades about as confidently as the latter cracks down on an ordinary scooter.</b> <br><br>  But if people have already figured out with electric scooters that you can save on travel and enjoy driving to work, the story of the monowheel is just beginning. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Important note!</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Historically, the word "electroscooter" refers to many different devices, including the Dualtron Ultra weighing 37 kg and a maximum speed of 80 km / h. <br><br>  I will mean only those models that, <b>without problems and doubts,</b> can be taken in the subway and other public transport.  Such models develop speeds up to 35 km / h and have a mileage on a single charge of up to 40 km. <br><br>  Most popular electric scooters: <br>  <a href="https://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3Dxiaomi%2Bmijia%2Bm365">Xiaomi Mijia M365</a> (popular name "Xiaokat") <br>  <a href="https://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3Dninebot%2Bes2%2Bes4">Ninebot ES2 / ES4</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3De-twow">E-Twow S2</a> <br>  and their numerous clones. <br></div></div><br><h2>  The reasons for the unpopularity of the monowheels </h2><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Reason # 1 - public opinion considers them toys</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Historically, the opinion in society has determined the role of the mono-wheel to be the next very expensive and very useless hipster toy.  Passengers with enviable regularity, asking me about the wheel, call it a hoverboard.  From the point of view of an inexperienced observer, there is almost no difference, and in both cases the rider looks almost the same. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Reason # 2 - ... absurdly expensive ...</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Fork prices for gyroscooters 5-20 tr.  The price tag on the budget wheel starts from 40 tr.  and quickly flies to 60-80 tr.  for the most popular models, and 90-120 m.  for the "top".  And since people don‚Äôt see much difference between the wheel and the hoverboard ... <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Reason # 3 - ... dangerous for passersby ...</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  A man on a monowheel is intuitively perceived as a danger.  It is not clear exactly how he holds.  It is not clear if he can drive you around and if he can brake.  How does he even slow down?  No kidding, ‚ÄúHow do you brake?‚Äù Is the most private question I hear from passersby. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Reason # 4 - ... for the owner himself ...</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  What if bump?  What if it turns off or breaks down on the move? <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Reason # 5 - ... and requiring circus training</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Because somehow it is immediately obvious that the thing is not for everyone. <br></div></div><br>  I sincerely supported most of these views. <br><br><h2>  Feelings and emotional evaluation </h2><br>  The monowheel is not an acrobatic projectile, but a full-fledged vehicle with characteristics similar to an electric scooter.  In terms of price, it loses speed to scooters, but repeatedly wins in freedom, feeling literally like a ‚Äúpocket teleport‚Äù.  A few days after the initial training, management skills go into the background - you get up on the wheel and seem to merge with it, and your body suddenly gets new opportunities.  The questions ‚Äúhow do you manage it?‚Äù And ‚Äúhow do you brake on it?‚Äù Lose all meaning.  It's like asking how you control your legs.  No way, damn it, I'm just going where I need to!  So here you go out of the door, look where you need it, the wind hits in your face and it‚Äôs as if you are flying, barely noticing noises like speed bumps or curbs. <br><br><h2>  Compared to scooters </h2><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">It is compact</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  I had a lightweight folding electric scooter.  I thought it was compact.  I was wrong, but I realized it only when I bought the wheel.  Entering the subway car with a scooter during rush hour is a headache.  To enter any car with a wheel is practically the same as without a wheel.  In the minibus and bus a small wheel fits under the knees in front of the seat.  His house is not visible at all, while the scooter needs a much larger piece of space. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">It does not burden</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  It is always with you.  In 99% of cases there is no reason to leave home without a wheel.  Cyclists have never dreamed of this.  It does not matter if you plan to go by bus, subway or taxi - you just take the wheel with you, without thinking that it will interfere.  To work, to the supermarket, almost everywhere.  You just roll it next to the handle if you have to go.  It rolls by itself, almost without effort, including upwards along steep ramps (with its engine it raises its weight!).  The need to lift and carry in hand arises <b>many times less than with a scooter</b> .  Even if you need to carry a wheel in your hand - thanks to a convenient handle and weight distribution, it is more convenient than carrying a scooter, even with more weight.  After all this - the electric scooter begins to seem like a creepy burden. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">It does not stain people</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Here it is necessary to make a reservation - <b>my</b> wheel does not stain people.  It remains clean enough after the trip, and it is always below the level of the knees, so you don‚Äôt need to go to the car to watch people not wiping it. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">It does not stain you</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  When you drive to the subway, you pull out / pull out the retractable handle and fold the pedals with your foot.  Coming out of the subway - foot, lay out the pedals and remove the handle.  In contrast to the dirty deck of a scooter or its folding handles, which strive to leave black spots on clothes. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">It is passable by electric scooters</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> Monowheels are 14 ‚Äù, 16‚Äù or 18 ‚Äùin diameter.  You can put on them standard tires, including aggressive rubber.  On cross, they can be compared to bicycles, although there are many nuances.  The thrust force is very smoothly dosed, it can be said all the time in ABS mode - as a result, the wheel <a href="https://youtu.be/8EPcglR-N74">goes over the ice</a> .  It also <a href="https://youtu.be/oRNomiFcTv4">rides on snow</a> , including <a href="https://youtu.be/zx1UDXsQQfA%3Ft%3D2m50s">very deep</a> .  As an option - <a href="https://youtu.be/3OcoHLkWE_0">on the trodden paths in the winter in the forest</a> . <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">It is softer and more comfortable rides</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Even the smallest wheel with a diameter of 14 "" is equipped with a rubber tire with an inflatable chamber.  From scooters - only Xiaomi nominally has inflatable wheels with a diameter of 8.5 " <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">It is easier to maintain.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Unlike scooters, there are almost no moving parts in the mono-wheel and there is good waterproofing right after the purchase.  In time, scooters begin to creak and play in general. <br></div></div><br><h2>  Security </h2><br>  <b>The wheel is much safer than it seems from the outside and at first glance.</b> <br><br>  ATTENTION!  I'm not trying to call it safe!  Falls are unlikely to be avoided altogether, and protection (knees / elbows / wrists) is necessary.  But this risk is much, much lower than it seems from the outside.  I did not believe when I was convinced of this.  Now it's your turn not to believe me :) <br><br>  I got onto the wheel for the first time in October, I went to work and back every day until the New Year, rolling out from 20 to 40 km every day.  Rain, wind, ice, snow porridge, slabs of wet polished granite at a temperature of 0 degrees - and all on the summer "slick" tire.  The first 700 kilometers in such conditions passed without a fall.  The first fall happened in the second half of December, when the city collapsed - fell into a hole under the snow.  And the problem here, obviously, is still laying :) <br><br><h2>  Power </h2><br>  If you push the gas all the way on the scooter - it will accelerate until the friction and resistance forces balance the maximum engine power.  When descending from the mountain, the speed will increase, while climbing, it will decrease.  Even a weak scooter can be greatly dispersed downhill. <br><br>  The engine of the monowheel tends to keep the pedals horizontal and accelerates, rolling under the rider and compensating for its fall forward.  If you allow it to accelerate without restrictions, then after reaching the maximum possible power (and speed) the wheel will not be able to continue acceleration, and the person will continue - face into the asphalt.  Therefore, the maximum speed of the monowheel is limited - when it reaches the engine, there is enough reserve left to overtake the person and pull up the pedals, forcing them to lean back. <br><br>  <b>Corollary number # 0 - inconsistency with traffic logic</b> <br>  SDA implies that all engine power is spent on acceleration.  The principle of operation of the monowheels implies that a significant percentage of power is not used and is always "in stock", ensuring safety.  Judge for yourself: both a 350 W scooter and a 1200 W monowheel ks16s accelerate to 35 km / h - and the wheel will not go faster, but the scooter can.  The difference in power is <b>almost four times</b> at the same speed, so it is impossible to classify monowheels by current traffic rules. <br><br>  <b>Corollary number # 1 - relatively low maximum speed.</b> <br>  For comparison, a scooter with a 300 W motor accelerates to 30 km / h in a straight line. <br>  My 800W mono-wheel with a motor is limited to 30 km / h regardless of external conditions - even down a steep descent it will not allow you to accelerate higher. <br><br>  <b>Corollary number 2 - excellent dynamics and acceleration</b> <br>  Until the maximum speed is reached and the currents do not exceed the limiting ones, all the available power goes to overclocking, and even a ‚Äúweak‚Äù wheel can easily deliver 1.5‚Äì2 kW for a few seconds. <br><br>  <b>Corollary number 3 - overcoming steep climbs</b> <br>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pLO7MzhdnM0%3Ft%3D1m36s">Scooters are not dreamed of</a> .  Where the conventional Xiaomi would have to drive - the budget wheel successfully drives in, slowing down. <br><br>  <b>Corollary number # 4 - the highest efficiency.</b> <br>  To travel evenly at a speed of 35 km / h against a small wind, you need to consume about 500-600 watts.  For the "medium" monowheel with a capacity of 1.2 kW it is only half of the rated load!  As a result - the wheel is almost not heated, all the energy goes into motion.  On a scooter with a nominal value of 350 W, the motor-wheel operates at this speed with almost double overload and it is very hot, throwing the battery charge into the atmosphere for nothing. <br><br>  <b>Therefore, when the battery is equal, the wheel goes beyond the scooter, without reducing speed in a head wind</b> . <br><br><h2>  Learning - Theory and Practice </h2><br>  The first thought, when you first try to get up and go - "THIS IS EXACTLY NOT FOR ME!" <br>  The second is ‚ÄúDAMAGE, THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE IN THE PRINCIPLE!‚Äù <br>  Everything is normal, our body simply does not have the necessary skill - <b>to keep the balance left and right on the fulcrum the size of a coin</b> .  This skill can not be taught explanations - it is necessary that the body was forced to try to do it.  The good news is that this skill comes within an hour, and then, after a few days of riding, it is polished to perfection.  It becomes as easy as standing on two legs and not falling.  The second good news is that we are perfectly able to keep the balance back and forth, there will be no problems with it.  <i>In short, this is not a circus art that has been studied for years.</i> <br><br>  It is best to study with an assistant - relying on his hand, try to keep your balance and go slowly.  After some time, it begins to turn out, and the assistant's hand is no longer used for support, but as a kind of "beacon" in space, relative to which the body holds the vertical.  After 5-10 minutes of driving ‚Äúby the handle‚Äù, you can learn to get up on your own, the body already knows about what to do.  Next - a question of a couple of tens of minutes and perseverance. <br><br>  Tip # 1: Straightening your back and unbending your legs, it is much easier to keep your balance.  It is useful when training - then you still have to ride on slightly bent legs. <br><br>  Tip # 2: turns are made not by the inclination of the hull or the wheel, but by slowly bending one leg, fixing the other and keeping balance. <br><br>  This is enough to get up and go as fast as possible - then the skill begins to grow at a tremendous rate.  A bit like riding a bike - once learned, you will not forget. <br><br><h2>  Wheel selection </h2><br>  The real choice is limited on the strength of a dozen models. <br>  It is advisable to first explore the forums and ask questions in the telegram channels.  This is not an advertising post, so I‚Äôm not going to give specific references - but in Russian there are only two main resources devoted to personal electric transport, and it‚Äôs easy to find them. <br><br>  PS still throw off, perhaps, a <a href="https://youtu.be/g_gy9quMhRQ">link</a> to the favorite review of my wheel model - budget Kingsong KS14D 420Wh: 3 <br>  Nothing personal, just a little prejudice, okay?) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/434682/">https://habr.com/ru/post/434682/</a></p>
