  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Zimbra - we build communications in the company</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Internal communications in the company are extremely important, and their organization is a separate problem of the IT department.  Without communications, it is impossible to exchange reliable information in a timely manner and, therefore, to support the workflow.  Zimbra completely covers the needs of employees of any information exchange company. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/524/a74/d9d/524a74d9dc834ae581c7893fc079c693.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There are two types of internal communications: with vertical and with horizontal connections. <br><br>  Vertical communications are established between managers and subordinates and are used to transfer decisions, formulate tasks and monitor their execution, information interaction and receive reports.  In turn, vertical communications are of two types and depend on the management style and traditions of the company: <br><br><ul><li>  ‚ÄúTop down‚Äù (from head to subordinates); </li><li>  "From the bottom up" (from subordinates to the head). </li></ul><br>  Horizontal communications are used for the exchange of information between company departments and employees.  They are necessary primarily for the normal functioning of internal business processes and should be regulated in detail.  Untimely or incomplete receipt of information, distortion and even loss of some data, as well as the lack of feedback, can lead to inconsistency of actions between departments.  Therefore, horizontal communication between employees is no less important than vertical.

      Internal communications usually depend on the stage of development of the company.  At the stage of creation, when the number of employees is small and everyone knows each other, there are no problems with communications.  Enough for normal email and messenger.  As the company grows, new divisions are created, employees are hired, and there is a need to think over business processes and establish horizontal links between divisions.  At the same time, it becomes obvious that the communication channels in each department can be used completely different.  There is an inconsistency and work begins to slow down.  There is an awareness that the company needs unified mail, internal chats and file sharing services.  In this case, all corporate communication channels must be reliably protected, and the company management could control them. <br><br><h3>  How to do it </h3><br>  Two directions of communication are important for any company: <br><br><h4>  post office </h4><br>  Both internal for the exchange of information between employees, and external for communication with customers, users and suppliers of products and services.  The standard features of various mail services are now a large amount of files sent (no need to ‚Äúsplit up‚Äù letters and archive) and an impressive amount of space for storing letters (the amount of space offered by the system is growing every day - it is not always possible to take half of this volume) .  Proper mail should also be able to distinguish spam and emails with viruses, without giving these functions to antivirus programs. <br><br>  <b>Zimbra Collaboration Suite</b> is a software product, analogue of Microsoft Exchange, which is a corporate-level email, calendar and collaboration tool.  Zimbra is equally suitable for large companies and small firms.  It includes a number of free and open products (Nginx, Apache, MySQL, Postfix, etc.) and has a very convenient web client - Zimbra Web Client, which is built using AJAX technology, providing pop-up prompts, relocatable objects and context menus.  Also included are advanced search capabilities and time dependencies.  It also includes online documentation, Zimlet modules and a full interface for administrators, written using the Zimbra Ajax Toolkit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/0d8/11f/508/0d811f508adb46cda57ebfb02176bd20.png"><br><br>  Zimbra Collaboration mail can be customized "by itself" by creating the necessary folders in which you can open access to colleagues for collaboration or editing documents.  Your mail is now a calendar in which you can not only plan your tasks for days, months or years in advance, but also assign tasks in the calendars of your colleagues and monitor their implementation.  You can create events, meetings, meetings, and invite colleagues or people from your address book contact list. <br><br>  At the expense of these and many other opportunities, Zimbra Collaboration mail allows to increase the efficiency of interaction in the company team by avoiding paper workflow.  Zimbra protects mailboxes from spam, and at the expense of the backup system information from Zextras you can find and restore any letter, even long ago erased. <br><br>  For the security of the mail is responsible personalized anti-spam system SpamAssassin.  Zimbra uses SpamAssassin to detect unsolicited commercial e-mail and rate messages.  "Spam" is defined as a percentage.  Any messages marked between 33-75% are considered spam and are moved to the Junk Mail folder.  Messages with a percentage of "spam" above 75% are always considered spam and discarded.  The Postscreen feature for spam filtering reduces the load on the infrastructure responsible for SMTP processes. <br><br><h4>  Chats and video conferencing </h4><br>  Messengers are tightly integrated in modern life, which means that it is necessary to encourage communication between employees in this format.  Zimlet <b><a href="https://www.zextras.com/suite/chat/">ZeXtras Chat</a></b> adds a fully integrated IM client to the Zimbra Web Client, using which you can communicate both in text chat and in video conferencing format.  ZeXtras Chat Zimlet supports two viewing modes: a compact and compressible ‚Äúdock panel‚Äù and an extended ‚Äúside panel‚Äù, suitable for a large number of interlocutors.  You can set statuses, manage contacts and much more. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ckEGc62ZVRo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In this way, using Zimbra Collaboration, you can provide communication in a company of any level <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://www.zimbra.com/">Zimbra Collaboration</a> </h2></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/334662/">https://habr.com/ru/post/334662/</a></p>
