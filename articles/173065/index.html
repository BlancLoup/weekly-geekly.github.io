  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The digest of news from the world of mobile development for the last week ‚Ññ6 (March 11 - 17, 2013)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This week a lot of news was connected with Android - Andy Hubin, the founding father, moved away from the project, Google blocked AdBlock, Flurry figured out how many devices the developers really need to support.  In addition, there is an interesting case for the promotion of applications from Microsoft, according to a PC Magazine survey, chose Windows Phone 8 as the best mobile OS, Philips opened a development program for Hue light bulbs, and ABI calculated that revenue from mobile applications in 2013 would reach $ 25 billion, 65% of which will go to Apple.  In general, there is something to remember. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/04e/600/97c/04e60097cb45afd2aec514299050ffec.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  iOS </h4>

At first it was intended as a tutorial, then as a collection of unobvious facts, but it turned out what happened ... <br><br><h4>  Android </h4><br><br>  <b>Shooting Time Lapse video for Android</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/172469/">Rus</a> <br>  Let's write a program to create your own movies in the Time Lapse technique. <br><br>  <b>Intel division has released a version of Android optimized for Intel chips</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/172467/">Rus</a> <br>  The development team of the Open Source Technology Center of Intel introduced a preliminary version of Android, optimized for the corresponding Intel chips.  In other words, there is a version of Android that can be run on a desktop PC, laptop or tablet, on which you usually work with Windows.  In addition, there is a tool that allows you to run both Windows 8 and Android on the same computer. <br><br>  <b>Google arranges spring cleaning and bans AdBlock in Android</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/172671/">Rus</a> <br>  Google delighted all developers of AdBlock applications with the news that all their applications were blocked in accordance with clause 4.4 of the Developer Distribution Agreement. <br><br>  <b>Android and Chrome OS on the road to unification: Sundar Pichai becomes the new head of Android</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/172637/">Rus</a> <br>  In the official blog of Google, co-founder of the company and its CEO, Larry Page, announced that Andy Rubin, the founder of Android Inc., and then head of Google‚Äôs mobile division, leaves his post, yielding it to Sundar Pichai. <br><br>  <b>Connecting Android sources to Eclipse</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/172491/">Rus</a> <br>  It turns out that the developers of Eclipse and Android have provided an excellent opportunity to see the source codes of our libraries (if available, of course) and use them to their fullest potential.  This does not apply if the library in the source is imported as a separate project.  All of the following applies when the library is in a jar file (this is how the Android API or JDK library is connected). <br><br>  <b>Life difficulties of independent developers</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mbt/blog/172409/">Rus</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c3d/3fd/123/c3d3fd123465d166658f98aa98812c6e.png" alt="image"><br>  Suppose you are an application developer and consider it necessary that your application be optimized to work on 80% of devices.

And I really did not want to work with SQL.  I'm used to somehow working with objects.  Therefore, having searched the Internet in search of solutions compatible with Android, I found only one thing - Berkeley DB, an embedded database. <br><br>  <b>Qt 5 for Android: preview</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/172639/">Rus</a> <br>  In this preview version, we focused on the developer experience so that you can easily run and test your applications on Android devices.  And although nothing prevents you from distributing apps with Qt 5.1 through the app store, we recommend not to do this and wait for the release of Qt 5.2, because we want to improve support even more ... <br><br><h4>  Windows </h4><br><br>  <b>The results of the promotion "Great eight applications"</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/microsoft/blog/172527/">Rus</a> <br>  Microsoft has shared the results of the promotion of the eight applications under Windows 8.

We spent some time on the Internet looking for one, but in the end we accepted the fact that there are no such libraries in nature yet (perhaps we were looking badly, but now this is not so important).  The answer to the question "what to do?" Suggested itself ... <br><br><h4>  Contests </h4><br><br>  <b>Began accepting applications for participation in the championship developers Evernote Devcup 2013</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/evernote/blog/172547/">Rus</a> <br>  As part of Evernote Devcup developers and designers around the world are encouraged to create products that can extend the functionality of Evernote, helping users save, share and quickly access all the important moments in their lives. <br><br>  <b>Second Mobile Apps Contest Apps4All</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/contest2013/">Rus</a> <br>  The second Mobile Apps Competition Apps4All is held within the framework of the project Apps4all.ru - the largest community of Russian-speaking mobile application developers - and is intended to identify the best developers of 2013.

DevCon's goal is to help developers better understand the social platform so that they can more confidently invest resources in creating applications related to Facebook.  Apparently, the event will be devoted to discussing updates related to developers, but there will be nothing on it like launching the Timeline or the Open Graph platform, like on f8.  Most likely, these topics will be important for developers, but for the general public will be of little interest. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/173065/">https://habr.com/ru/post/173065/</a></p>
