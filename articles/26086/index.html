  <section class="page js-page"><h1>touches to the business model</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  What is Sunrise, many know.  The electronics hypermarket (yes, not only computers), which, as one friend of mine once remarked, very much resembles a train station.  The place is very specific and the desire to return there does not arise if it were not for the prices ... The last time I was there a week ago, and it was well, the most unfortunate visit to this place.  True, I noticed one nice thing that I had not noticed before.  But first things first! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I collected a computer for a friend and picked up the components at home, saved the basket and wrote down its number in the notes on the phone so as not to leave it at home.  The price of the Intel Q6600 processor is very clearly stored in memory - 5700 OEM, 6000 - BOX.  Arriving on the territory immediately grieved us with the eternal spring problem of our country - asphalt was changed in the parking lot and therefore the dirt was ankle-deep.  And rushed ... <br><br>  <strong>Problem:</strong> For some reason, the apparatus for printing the order number printed so crookedly that one digit did not fit into the piece of paper! <br>  <strong>Solution:</strong> Print the number on the next machine <br><br>  <strong>Problem:</strong> Saved basket didn‚Äôt want to show up <br>  <strong>Solution:</strong> As it turned out later, it was necessary to go into the basket and find somewhere a link that says "there is a saved basket for this number" or something like that 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <strong>Problem:</strong> When you exit the basket, it is reset <br>  <strong>Solution:</strong> Select all components, check their availability in stock and type everything in one go!  For this reason, by the way, the saved basket would still not be useful. <br><br>  So, back to our <s>sheep</s> processors.  The price of the box version is 6000 rubles exactly (in other stores it is not less than 7 thousand).  The total amount of the basket is 22,800. We are going to pay.  Recently, such a thing as payment at the box office does not exist here - now they only get change at the box office.  We approach the terminal, click on the Saami best small button ‚Äúpayment and delivery at the checkout‚Äù (there is an alternative that is more welcomed by the store - change on the mobile phone) and ... I look at the line with the processor and see the number 5700. I look carefully - didn‚Äôt I take it by chance OEM, but, having re-read the name five times, I am convinced that it is the BOX.  After a couple of seconds, my eyes fall on the graph TOTAL and ... instead of 22,800, I see 22,500 there ... and immediately remember that both times before that, when purchases at Sunrise were made for similar amounts, these same amounts turned out to be suspiciously round. <br><br>  So, it turns out, Sunrise (at least for large checks) rounds up to 500 rubles down.  Thus, reducing their profits (on one client up to 499 rubles) directly from the sale of goods, but at the same time reducing queues (and, consequently, increasing turnover), reducing personnel costs (cashiers who give change, the entire store was discovered pieces, against approximately 50 terminals for receiving money) and taking off the problem of money exchange (to be ready to hand over change from any amount to any is not such a trivial task). <br>  As a result, the client is satisfied because he saved time and a little bit of money (in our case, a little more than 1 percent, but still).  The store is satisfied, because there is no end of customers, as, however, there are no terrible queues.  Here is such a conveyor of buyers. <br><br>  And about the time.  Now this is not such a station.  The time in the ‚Äúwaiting room‚Äù usually does not exceed 10 minutes, and there are no more queues at the ticket offices that once frightened off. <br><br>  How do you like such a stroke to the business model? <br><br>  PS Very interesting, what is the lower limit of the check amount, for such rounding?  If someone came across, post pliz </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26086/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26086/</a></p>
