  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Chips Yandex.Direct, which is silent help</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Not all features and subtleties of Yandex.Direct are written in the Help section.  Often you have to ask tech support for clarifying questions about various nuances.  Let us give examples of incomprehensible moments. <br><br>  <i>The first nuance will be - parsing on the example of ranking ads in the block of guaranteed impressions.</i> <br><br>  The fact is that on the <i><a href="http://direct.yandex.ru/help/%3Fid%3D1123165">direct.yandex.ru/help/?id=1123165</a></i> page <i><a href="http://direct.yandex.ru/help/%3Fid%3D1123165">it is</a></i> said that <b>‚Äúthe position inside the selected block depends on the CTR for this phrase in the advertiser‚Äôs ad and the similar CTR of the competitors.</b>  <b>Therefore, a situation is possible in which the ad will be shown in the first position in the block at the lowest possible price. ‚Äù</b> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      However, the rules on the <i><a href="http://direct.yandex.ru/help/%3Fid%3D990407">direct.yandex.ru/help/?id=990407</a></i> page <i><a href="http://direct.yandex.ru/help/%3Fid%3D990407">state</a></i> that ‚Äú <b>Ads in Special Placement and Guaranteed impressions are arranged in descending order of price per click.‚Äù</b> <br><br>  Here I would like to clarify whether the CTR plays a role in ordinal ranking of ads in special accommodation and in guaranteed shows or, nevertheless, not? <br>  On the one hand, it was stated that CTR only participates in selecting ads in a block, but does not participate in ranking in any way.  But on the other hand, it is argued that CTR is involved in both the selection of ads and in the ranking.  And yet, how are things really? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We answered those.  support for this question: <br><br><blockquote>  Hello, Alina!  The statements you made are not contradictory.  The selection of ads for getting into one or another block occurs by the product of CTR by the cost per click.  Although the ads in the block itself are ranked in descending order of cost per click.  That is, the higher the CTR, the lower the cost per click is assigned by the system.  And vice versa." <br>  Proceeding from this, in order for an ad to fall into a block of a key phrase with a low CTR, it is necessary to assign such a high cost of a click in the system that will provide it with the highest position in the block.  From this, there is a dependence on the CTR of the cost per click and, accordingly, the position in the block. </blockquote><br><br>  <i>The second ‚Äúguest‚Äù of our conversation with technical support is the ‚Äúsquare brackets‚Äù operator.</i> <br><br>  <b>We needed to find out how this operator works.</b> <br><br>  The answer is those.  support for this question: <br><br><blockquote>  Alina, good afternoon.  The operator "Brackets" [] allows you to set the display ads only for those user requests, which contain a certain word order.  For example, if the key word ‚Äú[buy a ticket to Peter]‚Äù is specified, an advertisement for the queries ‚ÄúPeter ticket to buy‚Äù, ‚ÄúPeter ticket‚Äù or ‚Äúbuy ticket Peter‚Äù will not be shown. Inside square brackets it is allowed ‚Äú!‚Äù To fix the word form, It is also possible to add negative keywords and the operator "" "".  The stop words inside the square brackets are fixed and are mandatory in the search query: the keyword [grill for the fireplace] is equal to the keyword [grill + for the fireplace]. If the phrase is enclosed in square brackets, there is no need to put the ‚Äú+‚Äù operator before the prepositions. " </blockquote><br>  <i>The third question that concerns us is the setting of time targeting.</i> <br><br>  For example, I set certain ad impressions in the campaign settings, but at the same time, I set the time in Moscow.  The fact is that my advertising campaign focuses not only on Moscow, but also on other regions, for example, the Urals or Siberia. <br>  Why do I have a question: is <b>there an automated adaptation of watches for each specific region, taking into account the difference in time zones, or, nevertheless, do you need to manually set the time for each belt to adjust the time targeting?</b> <br><br>  The answer is those.  support for the third question: <br><br><blockquote>  Good day!  Yes, when setting up time targeting, you specify the time of impressions in only one time zone.  Thus, for each time zone, you really need to set up time targeting separately.  This can be done by placing ads for different time zones in several campaigns. </blockquote><br>  Summing up, I would like to say that when setting up advertising on Yandex.Direct, you need to be extremely attentive and best of all, if you are worried about something, it is better to turn to experts who will solve your problem when placing text and targeting advertising. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295288/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295288/</a></p>
