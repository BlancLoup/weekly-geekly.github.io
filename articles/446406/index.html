  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The Tale of Ivan the Economist - the Future Programmer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This tale is about an ordinary Russian guy from a provincial town, of which there are a great many in Russia.  As usually happens in fairy tales, the hero spends the first part of his life stupidly, but then he begins to see clearly and begins to work miracles.  This tale is ‚Äúinteractive‚Äù - I am really looking forward to your comments in order to continue this story about life and career. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A good boy, Vanya, studied in a regular Russian high school on ‚Äú4‚Äù and ‚Äú5‚Äù, sometimes he received ‚Äú3‚Äù and even ‚Äú2‚Äù.  Especially passionate love for any school subject is not experienced.  In foreign languages, too, was not strong.  I went in for sports - I ran and went to the ‚Äúrocking chair‚Äù.  I did not particularly like reading books.  He loved movies and computer games more.  When Vanya was in the 9th grade, the family council decided that Vanya was ‚Äúnot a stupid boy‚Äù and he needed to finish 11 classes, and then get a higher education.  Vanya's parents were both with higher education, although in absentia-evening, they wished their son a good career and salary, which was impossible for them without a higher education. <br><br>  So Vanya received a full secondary education, passed the exam, and began to choose a university.  In his city there were 2 universities - technical and humanitarian, in addition, you could go to the capital of the region or even to Moscow.  At the family council, it was decided that Van should not go to Moscow - the city is big, it is difficult and expensive to live in it.  And the University of the Region did not work, because Vanya did not score enough on the Unified State Exam.  I had to choose between local universities.  Well, how to choose, then Ivan had no particular choice.  Traction to mathematics, physics and chemistry, Ivan did not feel, so he went to a humanitarian university.  Ivan did not enter the law faculty - there were not enough balls in social studies.  But Ivan gladly accepted the economics department for the specialty ‚ÄúEnterprise Economics‚Äù. <br><br>  Ivan honestly studied, performed all the tasks, term papers and practices.  As a result, he graduated from the university with a red diploma - that is, without triples.  As soon as Ivan received his diploma, he was carefully received by the military enlistment office and sent to defend his homeland for a period of 1 year in a military unit located in the neighboring town.  True, in the neighboring town, Ivan was not immediately, at first there was a training session, which went 2 days by train.  Parents visited their son, brought programs and money, the year passed unnoticed.

      As a result, at the age of 23, having given the debt to the Motherland, Ivan was ready to start working.  After searching for a couple of months, Ivan realized that he, a graduate economist, would be happy to be accepted as sales consultants in MVideo or Eldorado.  There were also options to go to sales representatives, but there is nothing special to catch there without a driver's license.  As a result, the family council decided to try to get a job at the plant where Ivan's father works.  Father's petitions to the leadership and several offerings to colleagues led Ivan to the position of junior specialist in the tender department of the commercial work department.  Ivan was assigned a salary of 18 thousand rubles and a surcharge as a young specialist in the amount of 3 thousand rubles. <br><br>  Two years later, the premium of the young specialist was taken from Ivan, but they increased the salary.  With all the indexations, Ivan began to receive 25 thousand rubles by the age of 25.  They celebrated their jubilee in a cafe, invited relatives, ate, drank, danced and congratulated Ivan.  Many guests hinted that it would be time to find a bride and create a family.  However, Ivan was unhappy and he was tormented by heavy thoughts that he was doing something wrong in his life.  He remembered himself in childhood, how he imagined his adult life - how free he would be, he would travel a lot, communicate with interesting people, participate in the creation of something new and useful.  Work at the factory was very different from the dream from childhood. <br><br>  Drinking with classmates at the evening of meetings, Ivan suddenly found out for himself that some of the guys who ‚Äúwent to IT‚Äù had a bigger salary and life was more interesting.  Ivan thought hard, began to read about work in IT on the Internet and decided to try. <br><br><hr><br>  Dear readers, please write in the comments - what do you think - why is it worth starting a career in IT for such a character?  What professions can he master?  What would you do in his place? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/446406/">https://habr.com/ru/post/446406/</a></p>
