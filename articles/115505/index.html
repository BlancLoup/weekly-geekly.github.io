Although, in some cases, business cards were not used at all.  It was a kind of ritual, because of which its participants were forced to spend their time in order to record the contact information from these cards in a more reliable place to store information.  Fortunately, times have changed, and now you can make any information easily accessible by storing it on the Internet. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Welcome to IdentyMe.com - a new service for storing your virtual business card!

    <h3>  IdentyMe - online service for storing virtual business cards </h3><br>  Creating a virtual business card was easy.  I must say that it looks much better than my previous "real" business card.  You have a huge selection of themes for decorating a web page.  If you do not like the list of free themes, then there is always the opportunity to buy something special. <br><br>  A virtual business card consists of the following sections: Home (Home), R√©sum√© (Summary), Portfolio (Portfolio), Social Networks (Social Networks) and Contacts (Contacts).  In the Home section, you store basic information about yourself, such as your profession, interests, e-mail address, website, and so on, as well as a link in this section so that other users can easily download all your data in the form of a business card. <br><br><img src="http://static.identyme.com/blog/identyme-1/identyme-vcard-demo.jpg" alt="demo vcard"><br><br><h3>  Summary </h3><br>  As the name implies, Resume is a section for storing your resume.  You can download it as a document or fill out an online form (occupation, field of activity, languages, skills, rate of your salary, and so on). <br><br><img src="http://static.identyme.com/blog/identyme-1/identyme-resume.jpg" alt="Resume"><br><br><h3>  Portfolio </h3><br>  The Portfolio section is a regular image gallery that you can use to your liking. <br>  For example, if you are a model, you can place your best photos in the gallery, if you are a web designer, you will probably want to fill it with your favorite web page designs;  if you are a computer programmer, then you can fill it with pictures from your favorite TV series (Computer geeks, it would be just great). <br><br><img src="http://static.identyme.com/blog/identyme-1/identyme-portfolio.jpg" alt="Portfolio"><br><br><h3>  Social networks </h3><br>  The Social Networks section is designed to store links to your profile pages on social networks and similar services (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), so that other users can contact you in several ways.  In the Contacts section, you can store your contact information, such as phone number, email address, as well as data from ICQ and other instant messaging programs.  At the bottom of the section is the contact form, which provides an additional opportunity for those who want to communicate with you directly through IdentyMe.com (which in some cases can be very convenient). <br><br><img src="http://static.identyme.com/blog/identyme-1/identyme-social.jpg" alt="Social Networks"><br><br><h3>  Contacts </h3><br>  If you have a lot of social profiles and contacts that you would like to combine and stop wasting time searching for them, then IdentyMe is perfect for you.  IdentyMe is a very easy to use contact organization resource that also combines the ability to store and share profiles in over 100 social media services.  We have done everything possible to make access to important information for you the most simple and convenient. <br><br><img src="http://static.identyme.com/blog/identyme-1/identyme-contacts.jpg" alt="Contacts"><br><br><h3>  Settings </h3><br>  You no longer need to pay money for the design, layout layout, hosting and server installation.  On IdentyMe you get absolutely free personal mini-site where you can store your contact details, portfolio, resume, all your social profiles, as well as choose a beautiful design, set your own domain name and much more.  Using the IdentyMe service saves you time and money. <br><br><img src="http://static.identyme.com/blog/identyme-1/identyme-customize.jpg" alt="Customize"><br><br><h3>  Free and Premium Accounts </h3><br>  You can use IdentyMe for free or for a monthly fee.  There are three packages: Basic (free), Plus and Maximum.  If you choose Basic, you can save up to 100 images and up to 10 social profiles.  You can also choose the Plus ($ 5 per month) or Maximum ($ 19 per month) packages, which not only provide space for more images and social profiles, but also give you the ability to add videos.  <strong>Our profile on IdentyMe.com</strong> <a href="http://card.splashnology.com/">http://card.splashnology.com/</a> <br><br><img src="http://static.identyme.com/blog/identyme-1/identyme-vcard.jpg" alt="my vcard"><br><br>  <a href="http://identyme.com/">IdentyMe.com</a> has many different features, some of which are very useful, while others are amazing!  For example, you can specify your own domain name (and not just IdentyMe.com), which is great for a business person.  You can also install Google Analytics for use with your IdentyMe account, which makes it easy to track the number of views of your business card.  Compare this with the good old business cards, handing out which you can never be sure of where they will end up (maybe in someone else's garbage can?).  Another good feature on IdentyMe.com - You can customize access levels: for any information, you can determine who can view it.  (Let's say if you do not want your home phone number to be displayed to everyone, and only so that only people on your contact list can see it.) And you can also look at the map for someone who is close to you and easily start a new relationship with this by man.  More recently, new features have appeared on IdentyMe that allow you to publish a link to your business card virtually anywhere on the Internet (for example, as part of your signature on a blog or forum).  Hopefully, the IdentyMe application for mobile phones will be developed soon. <br><br>  As you can see, IdentyMe is a convenient online service for storing modern virtual business cards and organizing contacts.  The site has a huge number of topics that are constantly updated, and can satisfy the special needs of any user.  IdentyMe is extremely convenient, so you can start using it right away without wasting time learning new subtleties.  And do not forget that in the business world, even little things are important.  Who knows, maybe as a result IdentyMe will help you get a new job, which you dreamed about, or sign a contract.  Ultimately, this is exactly what you need to stand out from the crowd! <br><br> <a href="http://identyme.com/signup"><img src="http://static.identyme.com/images/btn-create-vcard_ru.png" alt="Create Your vCard"></a> <br><br>  <em>Thanks to <a title="Splashnology" href="http://www.splashnology.com/">Splashnology</a> for this review and Tatiana Sychak for the translation.</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/115505/">https://habr.com/ru/post/115505/</a></p>
