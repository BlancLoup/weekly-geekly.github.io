  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Difficult questions - simple answers or not an ordinary question and answer service</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Habr! <br><br>  I want to tell you about my hobby project, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich came to me more than a year ago against the background of my hobbies of question and answer services.  Just at that time I was hanging heavily on Answers. Google and Answers. Mail.  One evening, inspired by the MUSE, I came up with a very unusual, in my opinion, question and answer service. <br><br>  What is the point - users ask questions, the answer to which can be either YES or NO.  Simply put, simple questions.  Developing the idea further into English, she took the form of the question: "Have you ever ...".  Unfortunately, it was not possible to correctly translate this fragment of the phrase, and the question was one-sided, so the idea was to ask simple questions in a free form.  It remains to come up with a name for this idea.  The result was <a href="http://ru.kwizz.me/">Kwizz.me</a> - this is misspelled (well, here again, English) the word quiz - quiz and me - me.  Literally - ask me.  So this simple at first sight site was born.  Here's what came of it:

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/ae48edd0/469f1632/3c35ae35/2070048d.png" alt="Kwizz"><br><br>  In short: to answer any question you have to click on one of Quiz‚Äôs eyes (a green check mark - yes, a red X - no), enter your comment (optional) and click on the language. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Since the site itself is more entertaining than serious, this ‚Äúface‚Äù was chosen as the answer form.  And the language - confirms your choice.  The selected answer is displayed as a ‚Äúslightly highlighted‚Äù eye :) <br><br>  After answering one question, the user automatically proceeds to the next. <br>  Comments, depending on the answer, are divided into two parts: comments to the answers YES and comments to the answers NO.  An important feature of the comments is their tree structure (as in Habr√©).  You can also see who, how and with what comments answered.  And in the user profile you can see both the questions he created and his answers. <br><br>  One of the important features of the site is the possibility of anonymous voting.  My friends persuaded me to turn it off for a long time, but I did not give up.  In fact, I myself know that sometimes I do not want to register at all, or I want to try first.  All the answers and comments of Anonymus (not to be confused with onanists) are stored under the same nickname anonymousX, where X is the unique number of the anonymus.  If the anonymus suddenly decides to register - all answers are transferred to the same user, but already registered, and the name of the anonymus corresponding to his comments changes to his new nickname.  The only limitation of Anonymus is that they cannot create their own questions. <br><br>  Someone will say: ‚ÄúWell, this is another Q &amp; A, nothing new,‚Äù but everyone goes crazy in his own way.  The project is not perfect, it was made on Friday evenings, which is probably why such a smiley turned out :) Constructive criticism is welcome. <br><br>  There is a <a href="http://ru.kwizz.me/">Russian version</a> and an <a href="http://kwizz.me/">English version</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131918/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131918/</a></p>
