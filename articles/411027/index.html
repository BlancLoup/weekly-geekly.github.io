As a result of several contacts, the following became known.  Each Rafe community is ruled by a queen, who is the only female in the community.  A relatively smaller part of the community consists of men with high intelligence.  Most of them are working individuals, large and muscular, capable only of carrying out orders of intellectual individuals and routine tasks. <br><br>  Reliably about this race is known: <br><br><ul><li>  There was only the birth of a working individual.  It was a "way out" of education, called by observers a "leathery cocoon."  The individual appeared somewhat smaller than the adult, and clearly more helpless, but already fully formed. </li><li>  It is known that working individuals within one community are genetically identical. </li><li>  Life expectancy of the working individual is unknown. </li><li>  The life expectancy of the queen and men is high and about the same. </li><li>  The birth of "intellectual" individuals was not observed, but there is information that they are born quite immature and have a certain analogue of human childhood. </li><li>  Sex change in adults does not happen. </li><li>  There is information about the tradition to take away the young queen (before maturation) from the community. </li><li>  Genetic features have been discovered that bring this race closer to terrestrial insects, and possibly fish. </li></ul><br><br><ul><li>  A. Suggest a mechanism for determining the sex of this race, the gender (genetic and phenotypic) of all individuals, the life expectancy of workers. </li><li>  B. Imagine whether a Rafe has a live birth. </li><li>  C. Suppose the Rafe community is left without a queen, but has a need for a new one.  Suggest mechanisms for how they could get a kindred queen, and which individuals should have stayed with them to do this. </li></ul><br>  Justify the answers. <br><br>  <b>Task 4</b> <br><br>  Representatives of the protoss race have anthropomorphic outlines of the body, with the exception of the structure of the extremities - they have knees and four-fingered hands curved back.  Skin color is greenish, bluish or gray.  Protoss are bisexual, it is known that both men and women are diploid.  This race is able to feed on the energy of light, but it is known that sometimes children are born with a reduced ability to perceive light.  Such children without special measures rarely live to the age when they themselves create families.  For the ability to assimilate the energy of light, the heterodimeric protein Stl from two subunits, S and L, is responsible, at least one is enough to maintain its operation. <br><br>  You are available to archive records of one of the large million cities of protoss, dedicated to their demographics and records of inter-clan marriages. <br><br>  As a result of studying the archives you know the following: <br><br><ul><li>  most of the protoss in the city have gray skin, bluish and greenish color are less common, and bluish about three times less than greenish </li><li>  reduced light perception boys more often than girls </li><li>  reduced ability to light perception is rare - less than in 1% of cases. </li><li>  in those cases when a protoss with reduced light perception started a family, then, as a rule, but not always, his daughters were healthy </li><li>  From clan records it is known: </li><li>  The clan of hereditary gray-skinned protoss decided to intermarry with the hereditary green-skinned clan.  According to the results of several marriages in the first generation, all children were gray-skinned.  In the marriages of these protoss among themselves, about three-quarters were gray-skinned, and among the rest (not gray), about one sixteen turned out to have bluish skin. </li><li>  Another hereditary greenskin clan was intermarried with a clan with bluish skin.  All the children from such marriages were greenish skin.  In the marriages of these protoss among themselves, three-quarters of the children were with greenish skin and a quarter with bluish skin. </li><li>  In marriages of representatives of the gray-skinned clan with representatives of the blue-skinned clan, all children had gray skin.  In the second generation, there were three-quarters of gray-skinned and equally out of those with bluish and greenish skin. </li></ul><br><br><ul><li>  A. Determine how protoss inherit skin color. </li><li>  B. Determine how the defect in light transmission is inherited. </li><li>  C. Why is the defect of light perception so rare among protoss? </li></ul><br>  Explain your answer. <br><br><h3>  What is going on? </h3><br>  Olympiad of the National Technological Initiative.  The goal is to capture the galaxy by 2035.  The remedy is to raise the generation of Korolev, Mendeleev, Sikorski, Vernand.  How - interested schoolchildren interesting tasks. <br><br>  Of the 20,000 participants in absentee rounds, 572 schoolchildren passed to the final.  The first part of the finalists, 360 people, came to Sirius in Sochi, where they competed in nine areas.  For the remaining eight profiles, competitions are held in March-April in seven regions of Russia - from Vladivostok to St. Petersburg. <br><br>  Some details about 4 profiles (out of 9), in which directions the Olympiad took place. <br><br><h3>  Neurotechnology and development of cyborg </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m7/mm/9l/m7mm9lqioki1l8k2ciped41lcgq.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  This year, the finalists made the control system of the bionic prosthesis of human hands.

Thanks to Dmitry and Catherine for inviting me. <br><br><h3>  PS </h3><br>  I hope next year at the NTI Olympiad to organize (underground?)
