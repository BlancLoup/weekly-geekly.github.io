  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Remote work</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, a real holivar broke out in Habr√©: freelancing against office work.  The topic of both is already quite beaten, thousands of opinions have already been expressed in support of one or another point of view. <br><br>  But I frankly do not understand why it is necessary to divide everything strictly into two parts: here is black, but white.  And about the fact that there are more shades of gray, somehow overlooked.  Therefore, I want to talk about <i>remote work</i> , which includes the "charms" of freelancing and office work. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, <b>remote work</b> is hiring for permanent work without the need to visit the company's office, as a means of communication is telephone or the Internet.  In this case, the employee can be hired according to the employment contract.  The employee has official experience, pension payments are paid, income earned is declared.  That is, everything is the same as in office work - with the exception of one, you don‚Äôt go to the office, and you don‚Äôt pay for work time, but for the work you have done.

      Ideally, remote work is when the company is located in Moscow or in St. Petersburg, and an employee (a good specialist) from a smaller city, but lacking the ability or desire to move and work in a megacity.  Of course, in this case, you can become a freelancer, but not everyone has this soul.  And office work, in turn, is paid very little on the spot.  When working remotely, you can simultaneously get to work on interesting projects, plus an almost unrealistic wage for a small town. <br><br>  <b>Here are the main advantages of remote work:</b> <br><ul><li>  you are free to allocate your work time </li><li>  guaranteed monthly income is usually quite high </li><li>  presence of official work experience with all the attendant </li><li>  you are paid for the work, not for the time spent in the office </li><li>  you can freelance in your free time </li></ul><br>  But in the remote work has its own pitfalls.  For example, it is very difficult to find a normal ‚Äúremote‚Äù even taking into account the current crisis of personnel.  Because few organizations will go for it.  The fact is that it does not fit into the principles of work of many organizations, especially with conservative bosses, and there may also be difficulties with registration or bookkeeping. <br><br>  <b>The main disadvantages:</b> <br><ul><li>  it is very difficult to find a normal "remote" </li><li>  you can not refuse to do the job (as opposed to freelancing) </li><li>  you should coordinate with your superiors </li><li>  sometimes you still have to go to the office </li><li>  you do not have live communication with colleagues (only telephone and Internet) </li><li>  most likely you will need such things as writing reports </li><li>  you must be a good specialist and be able to prove it </li></ul><br>  In general, remote work is a good option both for high-level specialists from the provinces who do not have the opportunity to leave, and for freelancers who are too lazy to organize their emergency situations and want a steady income.  It‚Äôs such a scheme: you have to do some work and get some money for it, if you do more, you will get more - but it depends on you.  Here, this principle, in contrast to "corporate bonuses" and "premiums", works more noticeably. <br><br>  Finally.  <b>But holivar!</b>  There is no conflict of interest between freelance advocates and the office.  As the saying goes, and the wolves are fed and the sheep are safe. <br><br>  Thank. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/39842/">https://habr.com/ru/post/39842/</a></p>
