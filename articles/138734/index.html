Below, in alphabetical order, is a list of participating developers: <br><ul><li>  Alex Ionescu </li><li>  Amine Khaldi </li><li>  Cameron Gutman </li><li>  Johannes Anderwald (Johannes Anderwald) </li><li>  Michael Martin (Michel Martin) </li><li>  Thomas Faber </li><li>  Thomas Lotz from Haiku </li></ul><br>  Let's start the ReactOS revolution! <br></blockquote><br>  <i>Especially delivers that the installation of ReactOS on a USB flash drive (unlike Windows) can be made using the standard installer without unnecessary gestures and dances with a tambourine.</i> <br><br><h4>  Commit <a href="http://svn.reactos.org/svn/reactos%3Fview%3Drev%26revision%3D55631">55631</a> - fixed epic "mshtml" bug </h4><br><blockquote>  [NTOSKRNL / MM] <br>  - use ARM3 allocation for PDE pages. <br>  There is no leaked anymore. <br>  Also fix bug 5857 (aka <a href="http://www.reactos.org/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ff%3D2%26t%3D10938">mshtml bug</a> ). <br>  Only for x86 now.  Timo, amd64 as well. <br>  Thanks for your patience, go back to testing now. <br>  I‚Äôm not even having dared touching this code. <br></blockquote><br><br><h4>  ReactOS and Haiku interaction </h4><br>  ReactOS and <a href="http://haiku-os.org/">Haiku</a> have a fairly long history of fruitful friendships, and each of the development teams helps each other whenever possible.  This, for example, mutual assistance with the participation at conferences <a href="http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/">SCALE</a> and <a href="http://fosdem.org/">FOSDEM</a> , and assistance in matters of development.  In addition, the Haiku project assisted us during ReactOS‚Äôs extremely successful participation in Google Summer of Code 2011 by providing our project with advice and recommendations on how to apply for the program, and we are still extremely grateful for their help. <br><br>  Work on the USB stack currently available on ReactOS was started by Michael Martin (Michael Martin), and a little later Johannes Anderwald joined the development.  Johannes recently made significant progress in completing the USB stack, and this was largely made possible by using the source code for the USB stack from Haiku. <br><br>  Much of the descriptions and data structures that make up the USB protocols were taken directly from Haiku, however, due to differences in the internal structure of operating systems, to use this code directly, you would have to write a special ‚Äúlayer‚Äù.  Also, Johannes used the Haiku USB stack code in order to better understand the behavior of USB devices and some nuances that are not quite clearly described in the USB specification, besides, when working with the code, he contacted Haiku and left feedback and recommendations regarding the code . <br><br><img src="http://img580.imageshack.us/img580/6420/rosusb.png" alt="ReactOS is installed on USB" width="1150" height="866"><br>  <i>ReactOS is installed on a USB drive.</i> <br><br>  Since both of our projects for most of their history were engaged in achieving similar goals and dealt with similar problems, we have a clear understanding of the upcoming difficulties.  ReactOS and Haiku hope that such successful interaction of both projects will continue in the future. <br><br>  Translated by <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/evilslon/" class="user_link">evilslon</a> . <br><br><h4>  Crowdfunding experiment </h4><br>  Crowd funding experiment completed.  In total, more than 12,000 rubles were collected.  Since no one took up the implementation of the requested functions, all the money was transferred to the ReactOS Foundation account, which will soon be confirmed on the official website.  The maximum amount of donations was 5,100 rubles, the most popular amounts are 10, 20, 100 and 200 rubles. <br><br>  We express our sincere appreciation to all the people who supported the project. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138734/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138734/</a></p>
