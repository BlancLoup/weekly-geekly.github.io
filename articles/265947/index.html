  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yota delivers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b5/89d/54e/0b589d54e6a94c1a875b2aa92ad2ec3a.jpg"><br><br>  Transport is one of the greatest discoveries.  A wheel, a wagon, a ship, a car, an airplane ‚Äî in different years, each new invention and development of means of transportation was usually followed by a serious economic growth of various countries and regions.  People have always tried to transport more, faster, farther and cheaper, because it gave a lot of advantages and expanded borders and opportunities, including for trade.  And we are pleased to announce that today Yota is also to some extent expanding the boundaries - we are the first among mobile operators in the world to launch a pilot project for the delivery of SIM-cards using drones. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As you probably know, delivery by drones is not the first such initiative in the world.  But still none of the telecommunications companies delivered the SIM-cards using drones.  Progress does not stand still, and we hope that, over time, courier drones will no longer be perceived as exotic, which the crowd of citizens rush to see as the first airplanes. <br><br>  Why do we do this?  First, we believe that soon drones will be widely used, including for the needs of delivery and transportation.  Secondly, without innovation, there can be no development, and the use of drones is innovation itself.  Moreover, this project is only part of the Yota Futureproof program, within which we are going to test various promising technologies in our experience.  If you remember, in February 2015 we <a href="http://siliconrus.com/2015/02/yota-electrocars/">announced the</a> start of a project to create a network of gas stations together with the distributor of Tesla cars in Russia by Revolta Motors.  For our part, we have equipped all the stations with Yota SIM cards so that the gas stations can connect to the Internet and receive the information necessary for their work.  And in April of this year, they <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/line/yota_vypuskaet_simkarty_dlya_connected_car">released SIM cards for Connected Car</a> , including Tesla.  You can purchase a SIM card for a Connected Car at Revolta Motors office.

      Yota works at the junction of IT and telecom.  To understand how to make new technologies more efficient for business, to reduce costs with them, to speed up processes, Yota will continue to conduct a series of experiments, which ultimately should reduce the cost and simplify business processes. <br><br>  And now we will tell more in detail about our experimental project. <br><br>  If you want to participate in it, you need to come from 2 to 30 September 2015 with a passport in one of the points Yotaport (at the Strelka Institute, in the Museon and Sokolniki Parks, as well as in the pavilion of the Polytechnic Museum at the Exhibition of Achievements Exhibition of National Economy) .  Yota representatives will help you fill out and sign a service application.  In a few minutes, the drone will arrive with your new SIM card.  Each of the points of issue will serve two drones.  If the weather is favorable for flight, drones will be able to do more than 700 flights daily.  According to our calculations, the cost of one drone delivery will be less than 400 rubles, for customers the delivery is free. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/027/0f9/ba4/0270f9ba4fa8464d8d6f6ba36edb9845.jpeg"><br><br>  The issuance of a SIM card is different, say, from the sale of pizza or any product, since we need not only to give the customer an envelope with a number, but also to conclude an agreement with him for the provision of services.  As part of the current phase, SIM cards will only be delivered to the above Yotaport.  All drones participating in the project are controlled by pilots - at the moment it is the most effective and safe way to fly a copter.  In this project, we specially selected such flight routes of drones, where the possibility of flight of manned aircraft is completely excluded.  The altitude of the drones is less than 10 meters, the range is several hundred meters, and the entire flight route and the surrounding airspace are in the operator‚Äôs control zone. <br><br>  Our goal is to test an innovative way of delivery in real conditions.  At the moment, this is the optimal implementation when the drone arrives at a certain point.  Given the unpredictability of the weather and not excluding the possibility of vandalism, sending the drone over a longer distance is still quite risky.  At the same time, a point of sale is much more expensive to open than to place a mobile structure.  The continuation of the project depends not only on whether such a method of delivery of SIM-cards will be effective, but also on external conditions that significantly affect the ability to fly drones.  Delivery by drones in winter, for example, is possible only under favorable weather conditions: no precipitations and strong winds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/958/91b/d94/95891bd948d4498e9b157884ad9119ca.jpg"><br><br>  We are not limited to delivery.  The project statistics will be published daily at <a href="http://futureproof.yota.ru/">http://futureproof.yota.ru/</a> daily: total number of deliveries, average speed and time of delivery, energy costs, weather conditions, average price of delivery, etc. <br><br>  The project with drones includes both a marketing campaign and an experiment to optimize business processes.  And with the help of Copters, we can potentially optimize the costs not only for the delivery of our SIM-cards, but also for advertising.  We do not exclude that the project will be more effective in terms of increasing brand awareness and loyalty than standard campaigns.  If the project is successful, Yota plans to launch in 2016 the delivery of SIM-cards by drones in several major cities of Russia. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/265947/">https://habr.com/ru/post/265947/</a></p>
