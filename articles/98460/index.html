  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The right thing number one</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, my name is Sergey Kuzmin, I work on Mobile-review.com, where I write reviews of various things.  Basically it is gadgets.  But, in addition to gadgets, there are other interesting things around, which sometimes do not fit into the default format of the resource. <br>  Actually, here I would like to write about the things that are necessary - or about the very cream among the things that fall into the hands.  A kind of collection of the best (or hellish) in my humble opinion. <br>  And I would like to start with one very useful thing.  But, for a start, some water. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3f5/390/acc/3f5390accd1e6092362e9d56b79e0d70.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The idea to write about a special trimmer for shaving the hair in the nose was born spontaneously.  The associative series was like that.  I worked once upon a time in a single publishing house.  And we had a system administrator there.  Tolik.  Or Vadik.  I do not remember.  Tolik was a powerful guy in terms of work.  I set everything up, plugged in, helped everyone and, as a result, became the head of all system administrators.  Tolik received money normally, bought a one-room apartment, began to furnish her according to his mind, he ordered some curtains from Spain there. <br>  One but. <br>  Tolik did not follow his personal hygiene at all.  That is, sometimes he comes to say hello and you clearly understand that a person did not see three days baths at least.  Toothbrush on Shreds crying.  And from the nose at Tolik sticking hair.  Sometimes stuck not empty (if you know what I mean).  As the managers were saying, so is the hunt to pick up the tweezers and all the vegetation with Tolik. <br>  On the one hand, it seems to be a personal matter for everyone.  On the other hand, when there is a team, there such things enrage others.  In many companies, corporate rules somehow make slaves bathe, shave and look human.  What is right. <br>  On the other hand, Picasso didn‚Äôt care - there is a famous photo where the artist sits next to the picture, hair sticks out of his nose and he, I repeat, doesn‚Äôt.  It seems that the author of the photograph is Bresson, but he could not find it on the network (don't be angry, brethren).  In winter, it is convenient to determine the temperature by the hair that freezes in the nose.  If you feel that they are freezing, then Amba.  Coldly. <br>  But the girls all these hair is not much like.  And we should remove them.  This raises a simple question - how.  Surely standing in a traffic jam, you more than once and not two saw sessions of nasal epilation in the car opposite.  Toning does not save.  In their noses are picked many.  It looks disgusting, especially when behind this occupation you involuntarily catch a girl - here she is sitting in a car and is looking for something there.  As if something new could appear there. <br>  It is foolish in the modern world to neglect technical benefits and, therefore, especially for admin Tolik and other gentlemen (ladies), I write about a trimmer for shaving nose hair.  There are plenty of models on the market, but especially for this review, I bought a sample from Panasonic, model ER407k.

In a small box, except for the trimmer, there is a thick instruction, rewound with tape.  In principle, any sane person will figure out without it, where and why to push a gadget.  But especially gifted recommended reading.  You never know, suddenly when you look at the trimmer, some erotic thoughts will appear.  Anything can happen.  The manual is concise: "Turn on the switch, and carefully insert the end of the outer blade into the nostril or the auricle to trim the hair in the nose and in the ears." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/35e/af1/ffb/35eaf1ffbe65967ace836e3b8b9a2384.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The trimmer itself is like a plump pen.  There is no need to dwell on the appearance, there are no strazikov, there is one bare functionality.  This is the power button, this is the blade, and there is also a protective cap.  The device works on a single AAA battery.  And, I will report to you, the thing copes with its main task. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fee/b6d/0a9/feeb6d0a95dd4333fea463f82e75b353.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, you yourself can imagine your face when you have this ‚Äúzhzhzhzhzhzhzhzh‚Äù in your nostrils - it is not particularly pleasant.  But much better and more hygienic than to tear out the hair with your fingers.  Or wait for someone to pull out.  Ask the dentist, they have stiff tweezers.  After shaving the trimmer needs and can be washed.  To shave something else, except for a nose or ears, you should not even try.  Or worth it, but it‚Äôs better not to tell anyone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f97/538/588/f97538588dd1ffd8ee0ae6380b95502a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Accordingly, the considered trimmer cost me about seven hundred rubles.  I did not want to scare you with nameless devices - such can be found on any market for two hundred and three hundred rubles.  Why this is so expensive, I do not know.  In any case, the Panasonic ER407K is not only the best friend of the system administrator Tolik, but in general any man experiencing the growth of nose hair.  It works for a long time from the battery, shaves it qualitatively, it is possible to wash and so on - joy, happiness and positive vibrations. <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98460/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98460/</a></p>
