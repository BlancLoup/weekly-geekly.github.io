As a result, managers (and, consequently, ordinary employees) got one more problem: they had previously suffered from time to time, that their business was not working perfectly, and then experiences were added that he didn‚Äôt work optimally ‚Äî that is, , without the use of modern technology. <br><br>  Of course, this trend can also be viewed from the positive side: the world has really changed, the rules of the game have changed in many markets.  General informatization is a global and objective phenomenon, whatever one may say.  A little later, most zealous people simply fell ill with cloud technologies. <br><br>  In the "clouds" you can find almost everything today: movies, mail, business, photos, chatting with friends, bookkeeping, taxes, and even government services.

      Nevertheless, opinions about the feasibility of introducing high technologies still differ from market to market.  But when this wave reached the sphere of recruiting, the number of doubters increased.  And until now, experts have no consensus about how useful it was, and what the future development of this direction might be. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  One of the users of ‚ÄúHabra‚Äù, who is a part-time HR-specialist, in his post <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/285366/">expounded</a> his own view on the tasks and problems of recruiting back in 2011.  In his opinion, they should be successfully solved with the help of IT-technologies. <br><br><h4>  Recruiting tasks </h4><br><h5>  Position requirements </h5><br><blockquote>  Surely everyone is painfully familiar with setting a task for a recruiter in the form of ‚Äúfind me a cool programmer‚Äù.  It seems to be clear what needs to be done, but what does a ‚Äúcool‚Äù programmer look like?  The answer is obvious - for everyone in their own way.  How to make the recruiter and the future manager of this programmer understand the requirements in the same way? </blockquote><br><h5>  Process definition </h5><br><blockquote>  It is no secret that each position requires its own process of selection and evaluation of candidates.  In addition to such standard steps as search, pre-selection, interview, verification of documents and so on.  there are specific steps such as driving for drivers, a test of technology knowledge for a programmer, a test for attention to detail for a quality specialist, and so on. </blockquote><br><h5>  Search for candidates </h5><br><blockquote>  The classic problem of any recruiter.  Search for personnel in IT has always been a problem, and in fact in any country in the world.  You have to hunt everywhere. </blockquote><br><h5>  Preliminary selection </h5><br><blockquote>  For me, this is problem number one.  Nothing complicated, you need to run through the resume, catch the key points, select the right ones, call and ask a few simple questions to assess the adequacy of the candidate.  Mechanical work, but takes a lot of time.  I had to work in conditions where in the day came up to 300 resumes per position. </blockquote><br><h5>  Interview Schedule </h5><br><blockquote>  The task is to synchronize the schedules of many people.  Nothing complicated, you can use any calendar or organizer.  The only problem is another program that needs to be kept close at hand.  Theoretically, you can use the same CRM, but it just so happened that I use the calendar in MS Outlook to organize my personal time, but I did not find a simple way to synchronize with CRM. </blockquote><br><h5>  Candidate rating </h5><br><blockquote>  The number of tools for evaluating candidates is truly large.  Starting from the manuals, and ending with ready-made programs.  HR forums are just overflowing with topics dedicated to candidate assessment techniques, compatibility with corporate culture, tests for intelligence, and so on and so forth. </blockquote><br><h5>  Track current status </h5><br><blockquote>  A typical problem I encountered was the complete lack of clear monitoring of the recruiting process and, as a result, the inability to predict the success of a search or in time to change the requirements.  A typical answer that I often received: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for, like there were two, called, didn‚Äôt get through ... there were three more, got through, turned out to be one of those two, invited another one, the first one came, everyone didn‚Äôt come up‚Äù. </blockquote><br><h5>  Database of candidates and interview results </h5><br><blockquote>  How does any recruiter start searching for candidates for an open position?  Well, of course, from a database of candidates that he or she possesses.  What does this base look like?  How convenient is it to look in it? </blockquote><br>  Suppose that in Russia over the past 5 years, most of these tasks have been somehow solved using software. <br><br>  Many have already automated the recruitment process.  The implementation of the ATS (Applicant Tracking System) allows companies to track job seekers at all stages of selection: from viewing a vacancy and responding to an interview and hiring.  So a recruiter understands through which channels (websites, social networks, employee recommendations, job fairs, and so on) more successful candidates come and where to invest resources. <br><br>  ‚ÄúFor example, if your potential candidates are‚Äú larks, ‚Äùthen perhaps recruiting advertising and job fairs should be adjusted to earlier hours in the future,‚Äù <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/opinions/business/18/05/2016/573c45f89a79477b80c943a3">writes</a> Boris Wolfson, HeadHunter Development Director.  - Another example of relatively simple analytics in HR is the statistics of the vacancy rate.  It can help measure the performance of recruiters and compare their performance. ‚Äù <br><blockquote>  Using computer-aided learning techniques, computers are able to support personnel decisions (and later make decisions) in various HR areas: tell which candidates to hire, who to upgrade, who can quit next month, and how much the company will cost.  All recommendations will be made entirely on the basis of data collected by the company.  Target metrics can be company time (to reduce staff turnover) or efficiency (for example, sales amount from sales managers). </blockquote><br>  It is easy to see that while in these arguments there are many assumptions, special cases, advances.  And this is a simple explanation - all people are different.  Because of this, it sometimes seems that some experts like not computers, but computers more. <br><br><h4>  Human factor </h4><br>  The founder of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superjob">Superjob,</a> Alexey Zakharov, <a href="https://roem.ru/30-05-2016/225316/zaharov-superjob/">in his conversation</a> with Roem.ru, goes even further and draws attention to another (albeit, to some degree dubious) task: <br><blockquote>  Once ads were glued on pillars - it took time.  Then there was a revolutionary leap - Superjob appeared - and communication between the professional and the employer became orders of magnitude faster.  Now only the neural interface and the delivery of vacancies directly to the brain could become a comparable leap forward.  Everything that is happening now in the industry is a slow evolution.  Some breakthroughs are not happening yet. </blockquote><br>  And for some reason, in this ‚Äúsad‚Äù situation, the words of one of the characters of Yevgeny Zamyatin‚Äôs novel ‚ÄúWe‚Äù are remembered:  Apparently, you have a soul. ‚Äù <br><br>  But Zakharov, meanwhile, continues to bend his line: <br><blockquote>  The human soul is dark, it does not want to algorithmize.  A person changes too quickly, his character deteriorates, new motives appear.  A person who has worked wonderfully in one company may work disgustingly at the same position in another company simply because his wife left him.  And vice versa: he can start to work well in another company, because, say, he believed in God. </blockquote><br>  But until a new breakthrough, fortunately or unfortunately, has happened, some HR specialists have come from the other side and continue to develop more humane methods of working with applicants. <br><br><h4>  Social networks as a recruiter tool </h4><br>  ‚ÄúThe war for talents is over - the talents won,‚Äù <a href="https://twitter.com/josh_bersin/status/433667214940438530">wrote</a> HR analyst guru <a href="https://ru.linkedin.com/in/bersin">Josh Bersin</a> .  He believes that hunting the best talents has become so complicated that recruiters are now forced not only to seek and hire talents, but to be friends with them, motivate them and attract, in other words - to treat candidates as clients - just as when selling product or service, only the product or service becomes the employer, its brand, corporate culture. <br><br>  In this regard, the role of business communication, which in modern realities has flourished in social networks, is becoming stronger. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe moment of launching Odnoklassniki [2006] was a turning point in recruiting,‚Äù believes Victoria Sorochinskaya, an expert at <a href="http://www.spice-agency.ru/">Spice Recruitment</a> .  You can find job seekers who have left work services on Odnoklassniki, VKontakte, Facebook, Twitter, and a little later on LinkedIn.  Recruiters and hunters gained access to a vast array of information and open contact information. <br><br>  Recruiters who do not yet use social networks in recruitment, according to our calculations, lose up to 70% of useful contacts, she said. <br><blockquote>  A situation that may be in the hands of a recruiter: You have long and hopelessly wanted to entice a candidate from a foreign company into your own, but you are satisfied with it, he doesn‚Äôt want to change anything and, in principle, feels great.  And, having read one sunny day that he was tired of everything, the authorities refuse to promote him in the service - and in general everything around is inadequate and do not understand the sensitive soul of a great specialist ... <br><br>  You understand: here it is.  Now you can safely call and offer yourself as someone who does not hurt, will take care and in every possible way encourage working zeal. </blockquote><br><h4>  "Ubilization" - our everything </h4><br>  On April 8, <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/300008/">it became</a> known that the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeadHunter_(%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F)">HeadHunter</a> platform team for posting vacancies and resumes launches <a href="http://hrspace.hh.ru/">HRspace</a> , a service for interaction between employers and recruitment specialists. <br><br>  Employers will be able to set their price for the job and choose the best performers.  Recruiters and recruitment agencies will work more actively with customers who have a need for employees, but there is no way to look for them on their own.  Up to five recruiters can work simultaneously on one employer application.  The one whose candidate first goes to work or passes a probationary period (at the option of the customer) receives a fee appointed by the employer.  Commission service will be 20%, according to representatives of HeadHunter. <br><br>  They argue that the model of this service is built by analogy with <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber">the Uber model</a> .  Looking ahead, we recall that this is not the first such service in the Russian market. <br><br>  First, the employer publishes an application for selection, setting the price that he is willing to pay the executor for the work.  HRspace reserves this money to provide the performer a guarantee of payment.  Then executive recruiters see employers' applications and respond to them if they are ready to take on the job.  Document management and payment between customers and performers will take over the service: users will not need to enter into additional contracts, it is enough to accept the public offer of the service. <br><br>  The competitors of the service on the Russian market are <a href="http://junglejobs.ru/">JungleJobs</a> , <a href="http://pruffi.ru/">Pruffi</a> , <a href="http://hrtime.ru/">HRTime</a> , <a href="https://stafory.com/">Stafory</a> and others. <br><br>  Stafory is Russia's first service for employers and recruitment agencies, its representatives say.  Among the minuses of the usual recruitment agencies, they <a href="https://stafory.com/about.html">indicate</a> : <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Endless cold calls <br>  ‚Ä¢ Lack of ‚Äúhonest‚Äù rating of recruitment agencies <br>  ‚Ä¢ The disadvantage of working with several recruiters at the same time <br>  ‚Ä¢ A large number of commercial offers and specifications sent by mail. <br><br>  The search engine model with the help of independent recruiters and recommendations of users of social networks uses the agency Pruffi Alena Vladimirskaya.  Service commission is charged in the range of one to several monthly salaries of a successful candidate to someone who offers the right candidate. <br><br>  Vladimirskaya <a href="https://roem.ru/08-04-2016/222090/hh-ru-uberstyle">admits</a> that HRspace can ‚Äúkill‚Äù traditional small agencies, but only if it can provide recruiters with protection from unscrupulous customers.  And in the case of personnel search, in her opinion, this will be much more difficult than in the Uber ecosystem. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe HR-marketplace model, where the employer and recruiter meet, and the whole idea of ‚Äã‚Äãkilling up the recruitment services has already been the impetus for the new development of this industry in Russia, where stagnation and stagnation have been observed for the last 25 years,‚Äù says JungleJobs founder Yevgenia Dvorskaya.  In her opinion, HRspace is well suited for mass selection, where there is no need for in-depth testing of candidates' knowledge. <br><br>  As it turned out, there is also a lot of ‚Äúbut‚Äù, not to mention the pros and cons.  The employer and the applicant may be overlaid with a bunch of online services, and even implant themselves in the brain of "nanochip", in the hope of collecting a complete package for all occasions.  But after all, even with such zeal, there are no guarantees that the applicant and the company will suit each other. <br><br>  Moreover, in the wake of general informatization, automation, automation and other "high-tech", enterprising developers of advanced services do not miss the opportunity to gain commercial benefits in the field of HR.  Their ‚Äúvictims‚Äù are often enterprising HR specialists who are ready to convince their bosses of the need to introduce a new service in order to work less.  On the other hand, the responsibility will still be borne by people, no matter how clever and self-learning a miracle product may be. <br><br>  However, many IT solutions really make the workflow easier, eliminating the routine and insuring against mistakes made out of carelessness.  But should they be considered as the main one or as an auxiliary tool of HR specialists?  Would such an evolution of tools not lead to degradation and loss of key competencies of recruiters? <br><br>  Anastasia Shevchenko, Head of Recruitment Agency <br><blockquote>  Of course, many processes are already automated in recruitment, but not all.  For example, in almost all work sites, we still look at the text-based summary, while modern technologies may well allow for video presentations.  After all, it is not a secret to anyone that for an employer it is important not only what experience and skills, but also what personal characteristics the applicant has. <br><br>  There are video resume services, but not all leading working sites support this feature.  The same applies to vacancies - most often, applicants are deprived of the opportunity to look at the employer, to hear people representing the company, to see the situation before the meeting.  Surely, applicants would be happy to have the opportunity to choose which vacancy to respond not only on dry facts and figures about the company. <br><br>  Until now, in many companies, there is no electronic system for storing and sorting resumes of people who have ever been considered in a company.  Sometimes all the necessary statistics are not kept even in ordinary Excel spreadsheets, let alone specialized software.  There is no statistics about people who should not be re-examined, no personnel reserve is formed, a lot of work is being wasted.  While accounting in any organization, for example, has long been impossible to imagine without 1C, and sales departments without CRM. </blockquote><br>  Natalya Chepkina, HR Specialist, one of the leading banks in Russia: <br><blockquote>  Of course, the recruiter's interaction with candidates now and even five years ago is a huge difference.  There are new search sites, professional communities, the same LinkedIn, which allows you to search for candidates not only in the country, but also abroad. <br><br>  And despite this, one of the most effective methods remains the recommendations and direct search.  I agree that there is a place of stagnation in online services for finding work and it seems that everything they could have come up with.  Often these resources are not enough, and it seems you need something else. <br><br>  At the same time, I am convinced that who is looking will always find: both the recruiter of his candidate and the candidate of his ideal employer. <br><br>  Online services are now much easier search procedure, and it does not need to reinvent the wheel and deliver jobs directly to the brain of the future employee.  First of all, the motivation of the candidate is very important.  If it is, then the right candidate will come through an online resource, and through recommendations, and even on an ad on the post. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302414/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302414/</a></p>
