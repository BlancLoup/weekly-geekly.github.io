In the sense - to fix the old bug, or come up with a new one.  It didn't work out ... If you remove all the exclamation marks from the analyst's letter, the oil painting seems quite ordinary.  The deadline of the product was lost in the past, somewhere in the middle of the Mesozoic era.  The programmer, responsible for shipping software to this deadline, worked remotely for the last two months, then did not work remotely and is now close to being fired.  At work does not appear.  The client is waiting for something (the completeness is not defined) for that big piece of iron in the corner (aha! The embedded platform!).  In general - save, dear comrade, the universe ... It seemed that nothing foreshadowed trouble ... <br><br>  Thus, from the specific information there was a 200-pound device in the corner and an e-mail programmer from whom it was necessary to find out everything.  Not much.  It was also the name of the product that we transferred to this platform.  But the name didn‚Äôt tell me anything, because until this incident I was working at all on the wrong subject.  I wanted to speak out loudly and emotionally, but swearing at the company is prohibited.  A fine of 500 rubles.  Therefore, he spoke quietly a thousand and a half and went to collect info. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  A day later I had a history of correspondence and a package of instructions, which should be translated into life and put together two old projects and another one for a new processor.  The workplace of the predecessor was located very close, the password for his car was, and therefore I decided to go to the computer "directly from the muzzle."  Attempt to type password failed.  Realizing that after the fifth attempt, the account will be blocked by admins, I decided to take extreme measures - to think.  I checked CapsLock and the layout is the norm.  Two more times entered the password - does not help.  I went to the window with the name of the user and tried to type a password there.  Quietly spoke out for a thousand rubles.  The letters were typed in quite Latin and in the right case, but they are completely wrong.  Somehow accidentally came the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe layout Dvorak.  I drove to my computer with SUSE, printed out the layout and entered the password.  First of all, I climbed into the ControlPanel and rearranged the layout to Qwerty.  You can work.  The day was spent in reading instructions from the Japanese, formatting a bootable USB flash drive, the war with the settings of the COM port and other quiet pleasures.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a3d2265b/b05b4d05/d8dade3a/436a7742.jpg"><br><br>  The next day, there was a need to climb into the virtual machines.  But it turned out that on the computer again Dvorak - the predecessor came at night remotely and again rearranged everything to his own taste.  Quietly spoken about five thousand.  A paper with a picture of Claudia fell to the floor and was thrown out by a cleaner.  Five thousand more.  We go to SUSE- printout of the image, enter the password, start the virtual machine.  Oppa - there is also Dvorak.  And the phrase in the instructions - "I could not adjust the grid."  Speak out ten thousand.  Virtual Linux machine without GUI and mesh.  It‚Äôs not just a password to be entered, it‚Äôs necessary to raise the grid, edit configs.  Once again spoke ten thousand.  This time, apparently, loudly, because someone came to calm down.  My instinct told me that it was not far to squint - to transfer my eyes from paper to clave each time and painfully look for a button.  To fix something in vi.  Ten thousand more.  I went to the admins, took the second clave.  Torn out all the buttons and put it in the right way.  Oops - a few buttons are not pressed.  Well, it's only five hundred rubles.  The Chinese brothers made the guide grooves on these buttons with a turn of 90 degrees.  Apparently all the buttons to make the same fenshui not allowed.  Okay, insert the buttons sideways.  Smear the Russian letters with a black marker so that they do not shine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/6253ded5/941402f1/855d5080/6f8a4c2e.jpg"><br><br>  We connect the second clave to the computer, work - beauty.  The default layout on this Fedor did not change - all the same, the owner will bring it back.  But vi I don‚Äôt like (such is the wrong linux user), and therefore I picked up the network configs from the source code mc and joe before editing - they are always with me on a flash drive.  Finally calmed down and went to drink Kofia.  Now you can go to Fedor via ssh, and there the layout will always be mine. <br><br>  How to build a project is another story.  But I still have this magic keyboard lying around, and I shudder at the word Dvorak.  And I have been working for the second year not just with Linux, but with Linux on embedded platforms.  500 rubles. <br><br>  <i>Herman Zyuzin,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Product Development Department</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125708/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125708/</a></p>
