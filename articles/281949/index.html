In this article, we will analyze the work from the prizes and reflect a bit about the event as a whole. <br><br>  Schoolchildren from all over the country could participate.  Three nominations were proposed: animation, game or music track.  The main condition is that all works must be created using code.  In the first weeks, 800 people registered.  Regions were very active: they were often registered with whole classes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d0/0e2/fe6/4d00e2fe6b1b403fbb4b2b35729dec3f.png">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Unfortunately, those who wanted to code an electronic music track on the <a href="http://sonic-pi.net/">Sonic Pi were</a> not found at all.  And in general with music somehow by.  There was only one job in FruityLoops, obviously not prepared in the framework of the competition.  With animations, too, the trouble, they were, but the code was not traced in them.  Only one job went according to the conditions - an interactive story about a kolobok on Scratch, we will consider it along with the game Scratch projects. <br><br>  Evaluated by three parameters: originality, manufacturability and plot. <br><br><h1>  Projects finalists </h1><br><h2>  Soliptarium (Solyptarium) </h2><br>  Status: finalist <br>  Author: Iksanov Karim, 17 years old <br>  Development Platform: GameMaker 8 Pro <br>  Launch Platforms: Windows <br><br>  This game is a masterpiece in my personal opinion.  I want to play this game, and I finished playing to the end.  My character discovers the ability to change the state of the world.  Since there are only numbers in the world, they notice that I am not like everyone else.  And this is where the adventure begins.  The atmosphere is addictive.  Music, dialogue, graphics - whole story. <br><br>  Since the game was created in the constructor, there is not a lot of code in it.  Basically he describes exactly the game logic and you will not find anything unusual in it.  The code in GameMaker is a handler for certain events of objects (creation, intersection, drawing, etc.) in GML, a special scripting language. <br><br>  Although perhaps this very fact gave Karim time and resources to focus on the gameplay and plot.  The game lost quite a few points to the leader, precisely in terms of manufacturability. <br><br>  The process of the game: <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/GzzcG2u0FEc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhibK64R2a_YsKK0IxnX0dlZ97yVQw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  A playable version is available <a href="https://yadi.sk/d/oRio91aHkpbPu">here</a> . <br><br><h2>  Cut from cube </h2><br>  Status: finalist <br>  Author: Alexey Muratov, 15 years old <br>  Development Platform: Unity <br>  Launch Platforms: Android <br><br>  Alexey's game was created not for the competition, but a year earlier.  This is a puzzle.  You have a 3x3x3 cube in which you need to recreate the geometric shape specified for the level.  The difficulty is that it is impossible to include a certain point of the cube, perpendicular lines intersecting at the clique point are included.  If there are already activated points in the path of the lines, they are inverted.  In fact, it is easier to watch the video to understand. <br><br>  There is not a lot of code, as there is not much logic in the game.  The game as a whole is minimalist. <br><br>  The process of the game: <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/HQK6Zk4WN1Y%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhmpS6mFdByxqYHAcdVRUkpTm5rlw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The game is available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.mzxProject.cutFromCube">Google Play</a> . <br><br><h2>  Evolution </h2><br>  Status: finalist <br>  Author: Ovechkin Slava, 8 years old <br>  Development Platform: Scratch <br>  Launch Platform: Web <br><br>  In all games of 8 year olds, father's hands are clearly visible :) <br><br> <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/95288786/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc3/86e/79a/dc386e79a237498199a38112f225aefa.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Slava used the video capabilities of Scratch, you need to play in the literal sense of the word with your hands, discarding ‚Äúharmful‚Äù food and skipping useful food.  In the game you start an amoeba and you can develop into other species, you need to eat the right food and not miss the evolutionary bonuses. <br><br>  In fact, not everyone knows, but in Scratch there is a 2D software kinnekt.  It is very easy to use.  A year ago, together with <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/prodlenka/">Prodlenkoy,</a> we did a great master class on this topic. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/VvonrofhyeA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjawsPOqa8m8OPMB-B9zC-jyKTrrg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  Conversation with chikoy </h2><br>  Status: finalist <br>  Author: Alexey Zilovets, 8 years old <br>  Development Platform: Scratch <br>  Launch Platform: Web <br><br> <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/81569898/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c0/586/37a/2c058637ac594f03ae7f6e24e34428a9.png"></a> <br><br>  This is no less than a prototype of Siri :) Dialogues go smoothly, a list of supported topics from the author‚Äôs context.  When reviewing the code, the jury was alerted, everything was too clear for an 8 year old boy.  So dad / brother or anyone else there - hello :) <br><br><h1>  Projects winners </h1><br><h2>  Gingerbread Man </h2><br>  Status: won in the animation nomination <br>  Author: Maxim Zateichuk, 9 years old <br>  Development Platform: Scratch <br>  Launch Platform: Web <br><br> <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/90733089/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b58/712/06c/b5871206cb7f4e0896262807ca4f659f.png"></a> <br><br>  I really liked the project.  Interactive makes it almost a game.  Kolobok before each forced march should be stocked with notes, then he will be able to distract the characters he meets. <br><br><h2>  Citadel </h2><br>  Status: winner in the game nomination <br>  Author: Danil Fedorov, 14 <br>  Development Platform: C ++, OpenGL <br>  Launch Platform: Windows <br><br>  This is a real-time strategy written in C ++. <br><br>  The winner scored the most points from the jury.  In fact, the game is not implemented until the end.  But Danila did a truly titanic work.  We have a version where we have a base, we can build slaves, barracks and soldiers.  Near the base mine.  The goal is to hold out for 10 minutes.  It is necessary to do everything quickly, otherwise men with clubs will come and cut out your settlement. <br><br>  The game is inferior to the plot and atmosphere Soliptrium, but wins in the parameter manufacturability.  We close our eyes to careless formatting, the fact that there are only three source files, all in one heap :) We must pay tribute to the efforts of Daniel.  A lot of things have been done manually, for example, parsing tga &amp; wave files, the benefit is at least audio output through the OpenAL library.  Although, again, remembering myself at this age, I realized that I was experimenting with experimenting, I wanted to try everything myself.  And probably this is correct. <br><br>  The process of the game: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/CTyV61DVfVs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhvS6gW9iWQrEpZquTA9u5Ts_BgAw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  A playable version is available <a href="https://yadi.sk/d/QZyFky12rQ5jo">here</a> . <br><br><h2>  Presents </h2><br>  The winner in the animation nomination is Zateichuk Maxim. <br><br>  Maxim receives the book "How it is built" from the publishing house Mann-Ivanov-Ferber and the main prize - <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/">Raspberry Pi2</a> .  We hope that with his help he will create some fantastic device :) <br><br>  Finalists in the nomination game: Karimov Iksanov, Alexey Muratov, Slava Ovechkin, Alexey Zilovets. <br><br>  The guys also get the book "How it is built" from the publishing house Mann-Ivanov-Ferber and <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/">Raspberry Pi2</a> . <br><br>  The book <a href="http://www.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/books/kak-eto-postroeno/">‚ÄúHow it is built‚Äù is</a> devoted to outstanding engineering structures with an emphasis on the technical side of the issue - how people made engineering decisions and how they coped with the challenges of construction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e94/6bc/eed/e946bceedfc44f33a05a56acde8af910.png"><br><br>  Well, our main winner is Danil Fedorov. <br><br>  In addition to the book from the MYTH, Danila gets <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/psvita/">Sony Vita</a> .  As it turned out, Danila was from Moscow, so we decided to also arrange for him to meet with game developers from Mail.ru. <br><br>  We sincerely hope that our competition has helped the guys become interested in programming and demonstrate their skills.  And, of course, special thanks to all those who participated, but whose works did not reach the final. <br><br>  We need to do work on the bugs in order to once again hold a competition at a higher level this fall.  If someone has ideas, we are open and very interested. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/281949/">https://habr.com/ru/post/281949/</a></p>
