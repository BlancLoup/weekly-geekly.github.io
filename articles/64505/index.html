You need to be able to cook, as with any man.  This fact is indisputable.  Moreover, everyone has a few favorite dishes of them and need to be able to cook. <br>  All IT people love homemade food, because they often do not know how to cook it themselves, and at work they eat what God sends. <br><br>  2. For IT people in general, you need to take care of meticulously (wearing the same sweater for 2 years is not a problem.), Many are very lazy.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  3. you need to prepare for the fact that you often have to listen to nonsense (is it nonsense?), About programming server games, etc. <br><br>  4. It is necessary to immediately mentally prepare for the friends of such a man, in my opinion, nothing can be more difficult for a girl than a bunch of IT people who speak an incomprehensible language.  If you are in the subject line and understand the essence of the conversations, then this is just fine, IT professionals will love you. <br><br>  5. You need to be patient and not be able to distract, it annoys me a lot when they pull me.  Programmers have such a thing as ‚Äúlocomotive state‚Äù, i.e.  I sat down to work, tuned in to work and work, if distracting, then I will have to do all this again.  Moreover, in this state, absolutely do not care for the surrounding reality, i.e.  Of course you notice her, but with difficulty, because your head is so full that sometimes you do not feel the feeling of hunger.  Designing complex and fairly complex systems requires a lot of brain resources, i.e.  the head is clogged absolutely and simply impossible to escape, if distracted, then you have to remember everything again, remember what you did and why you did, tune in to work in general. <br><br>  6. It is necessary to get used to the fact that many programmers and IT people do not sleep at night but sleep during the day (not all of course), but the daily routine is usually absent especially among freelancers. <br><br>  7. As a rule, it will be boring for programmers to talk to your girlfriends / friends, but as a rule, many educated and intelligent people will pretend that they are pleased with communication, out of politeness. <br><br>  8. All IT specialists have some kind of hobby, as a rule, it is not connected with computers, very often these are some kind of active actions (that is, clearly not collecting stamps), because you get tired of computers and need to be distracted and do something better active at least walk in the evenings. <br><br>  9. Many suffer from the fact that they are not in the topic of what is happening in the world and society, often from me for example you can hear: ‚Äúand what Jackson has already died?  Yes?  what a shame? ‚ÄùMoreover, no one gets into show business and does not know the latest events from dom2.  My mother once said, ‚ÄúYou have become a fool with your computer,‚Äù because I did not know that Basque was married. <br><br>  10. Many people like to watch movies, TV shows, movies, listen to music and understand this quite strongly.  For example, serials (it crowd, the bing bang theory, house md, the lost). <br><br>  11. Many, as it is seen from the side, ‚Äústupid‚Äù: they can stick in poles, inhibited to react to any stimuli.  This is due to thinking about something on specialization. <br><br>  12. If some IT specialist agreed to repair the computer, consider it a great happiness, because it is enough at work, and it is terribly annoying when in the middle of the weekend ‚Äúoh I have something with a computer, do not you look?‚Äù.  Often this is a common way of dating. <br><br>  13. If a programmer is alone, then it is very easy to seduce a recipe: <br>  13.1 We need to find his messenger (icq, skype) or home page, his blog or something else <br>  13.2 make conversation with him <br>  13.3 ask for a visit or invite to yourself (better of course the first) <br>  13.4 tasty feed. <br>  13.5 Do not ask to fix the computer!  If there is one in an apartment, an IT person can do it himself out of goodwill.  Especially if he needs this computer, for example, to check e-mail.  Here you sit down at such a computer, but everything is wrong there and you need to configure it. <br>  13.6 Find out whether they consume alcoholic beverages (many do not consume, considering that they destroy the brain and precious neurons) - to offer alcohol. <br>  13.7 in 90 percent of cases should provide a place for smoking. <br><br>  14. Programmers are very fond of the girls of their profession, they are like an artifact one per thousand people.  A vivid example of a forum topic: <a href="http://zendframework.ru/forum/index.php%3Ftopic%3D847.0">zendframework.ru/forum/index.php?topic=847.0</a> <br><br>  15. IT people outside IT are very interesting and often non-standard people, they are naive in places, not predictable in places.  They need a certain approach, yes, but as a rule, nothing complicated.  Most lead a quiet and measured life.  Many people love children, but absolutely everyone is afraid of it as a fire because they simply do not know what to do with them. <br><br>  PS: the majority is written from me ( <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/gibbzy/" class="user_link">gibbzy</a> ) and not the fact that it comes to the rest.  In general, all IT people are the same people and just as different. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/64505/">https://habr.com/ru/post/64505/</a></p>
