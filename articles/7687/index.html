And most importantly - is it necessary to fight it?  Maybe this is a natural process, an unconditional stage in the evolution of photography? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Before proceeding to the questions outlined above, I will answer other questions that you may have, dear ones: I am not an art critic and do not consider myself to be a professional photographer;  I am not a historian;  I by no means claim to the absolute correctness of my point of view, I simply express it.

      So what has changed?  A lot has changed!  The world has changed, views have changed, the demand for photography has changed and, most importantly, the technique has changed, making the photo publicly available.  Each of us can take a camera in hand and, without bringing the viewfinder to the eye, take a frame.  It is possible that this frame will not be bad, for luck and chance are the inalienable companion of this art form!  But it is not about luck that we are now, but about the relation of photography to art.  Specific photos / photos. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the term ‚Äúphotography‚Äù in Russian is too universal.  The game of professional musicians we call ‚Äúmusic‚Äù.  But can we call music bryakanie a person who can not handle a musical instrument that does not have a musical ear?  There will be sounds, but not music!  The same with a photo - not every shot can be a real photo.  Only the words for this category of photographs, with their dominant number, are not.  I just call them ‚Äúpictures‚Äù. <br>  We are all at least potential producers of "photos", but not all of us can be a photographer.  These masters of photography know by name, there are only tens of them.  And us - millions.  Photography (in a general sense) quantitatively becomes the most common means of documentation, and not a multifaceted branch of art.  And I think this is normal.  Moreover - naturally!  Our children from an early age learn to draw and this is a necessary skill for life, an exercise that, in addition to the necessary, also develops a sense of taste and composition.  And the love of ‚Äúphotos‚Äù can be not only a means of documenting specific moments, but also a simulator for potential photographers.  For those who want to build a bridge between "photos" and "photography." <br><br>  In an insane amount of produced "pictures", really worthy works are lost, those that deserve to be called "photography."  But "photos" and "photos" are not competitors.  Neither of them, nor the others will outlive, displace.  I think that over time, two independent and unequal directions will gradually emerge from the ‚Äúcommon photo‚Äù: public (popular, mass) photography and photo art.  Sure!  What do you think? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/7687/">https://habr.com/ru/post/7687/</a></p>
