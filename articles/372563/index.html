The building itself was built in the last century - solid, with high ceilings and wide large windows, it turned out to be unsuitable for housing.  The floors were divided into separate studios and offices with plasterboard bulkheads and were rented for a relatively small fee.  Victor opened a studio here a few years ago, after the company where he worked before transferred the business to another region.  The outflow of production from large cities led to a long-awaited environmental improvement, simultaneously making room for business.  And where they now sewed shoes with sneakers and under what brand, it was not so significant.  Even a naturally cheerful Victor could not call his business particularly successful, but things somehow went, at least for rent and a modest bachelor life enough money.  However, recently the number of its listeners has been steadily falling.  This was clearly evidenced by the schedule in the calendar and, as a direct consequence, revenue.  Google analyst beat the alarm and drew depressing graphs of page visits.  These signs overwhelmed Victor reluctantly to pay advertising in Google to raise the attendance of the resource.  The results were not long in coming, and after several days of correspondence, he formed a new group of five people.  The first free meeting was supposed to happen today.  Naturally, Victor to her carefully prepared.  The results of the first lesson determine everything; all marketing gurus unanimously agreed.  Half an hour before the start of the lesson, he was clean-shaven, trimmed, ironed (where it was possible), parked his bike near the entrance and now paced around the studio, critically looking at the details and straightening the evenly standing chair, or the lop-sided hieroglyph in frame, and in front of the statuette of a laughing Buddha, he put a small bunch of fresh flowers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first came a nondescript middle-aged lady named Irina.  While Victor fumbled with the drinks, the rest were drawn up.  Having handed over to everyone to a cup of green tea and sat them in chairs in a circle, Victor smiled broadly and proceeded to the first part of the lesson.  Briefly telling about himself (in fact, his story was not very different from the summary posted on the personal page), he offered to meet the rest of the group. <br><br>  Irina led a culinary blog for vegetarians.  Paul was a wedding photographer.  Semyon - an interior designer.  Elena taught yoga courses (in the same building).  Eugene was a walrus and professionally engaged in tempering.  All of them were experts in their fields, although they had a completely different education (of course, a higher education).  And they preferred creative work to sitting in offices.  Victor nodded sympathetically, smiled encouragingly and thanked the narrators.

      - Friends!  - he went to the second part of the lesson.  ‚ÄúYou all do wonderful things, but something bothers us all, which is why we are here, haven't we?‚Äù  Something is gnawing at us, we feel insecure, we are afraid of old age, illness, loneliness.  We are afraid to be invaluable and unclaimed.  This is peculiar to every individual and therefore perfectly normal.  Let's think together what makes us feel these feelings?  Perhaps, the matter is in high expectations, from which our self-esteem suffers?  After all, to convince others of the effectiveness of our activities, we ourselves must serve as a good example.  To attract success, it is necessary to experience the joy of our work, to radiate confidence in their abilities, professional and human qualities.  To achieve this, you need to concentrate on those things that we succeed best of all, and to distract from nonessential or secondary manifestations of our life with you!  This course is about how to do this easily and efficiently. <br><br>  ‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù said Irina.  - Abstracted from irrelevant manifestations, this is certainly a method.  To attract success is surely effective.  But they constantly talk about it in Feng Shui courses.  I went there last year ... <br><br>  ‚ÄúAnd I am telling about this as an additional material in my courses,‚Äù added Elena-yogi. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI see the problem a little differently,‚Äù Irina continued.  - A few years ago, when people began to think about their own health, I had no end of visitors on my site.  I collected so much for advertising that my husband and I had enough to pay for the mortgage and to go to Mallorca.  We even thought about the children.  And now from these sites in the eyes full of. <br><br>  She paused and pursed her lips.  There was an awkward pause. <br><br>  - Everything will be fine!  - Victor took the initiative.  - The main thing is not to despair and look at things from the good side.  Let's look at it differently.  You oriented on time and opened your website.  In the fat years, it brought you a fair income, but you did not think that all this could change, and hoped that everything would continue this way and in the future.  These are the overstated expectations that we talked about.  Now that your income has fallen, you are frustrated and prone to self-flagellation, but you cannot fall into despair, you need to look at it differently, pull yourself together and find a way out! <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quite simple not to fall into despair,‚Äù Elena-yogi got into the conversation.  - Finding a solution is much more difficult.  When I opened my courses, people poured in on a shaft, but over time, people who graduated from my courses opened their own, and people who graduated from those courses, in turn, opened their own.  Now these courses - even ass chew, sorry.  In each gate, there is a para-three.  Maybe they are worse, yes.  But how are they dumping! <br><br>  They all nod in agreement. <br><br>  - This is nothing!  - Pavel the photographer took the floor.  - When the era of digital photography began ... <br><br>  ‚ÄúSoooo, it's starting,‚Äù thought Victor, but didn‚Äôt get into it.  From his own experience, he knew perfectly well that once the people started, you need to let him talk and only then, when everyone is exhausted, return the conversation to the intended course. <br><br>  ‚Äú... and now for every ten guests there are two mirrors, and they do quite well themselves.‚Äù  I'm not talking about iPhones.  - After Pavel, the walrus Eugene made a speech.  - Maybe you think I became a walrus from a good life?  Of course, I dabbled in a contrast shower for a long time.  But when my KB was covered and I was outside the gate, there was nothing to pay for heating and hot water, so I had to wash cold.  After some time I developed my program.  He opened the school of hardening, not the same as teaching materials.  But here you will not run up especially: the program is being mastered in an hour by the training manual from the Internet, so it is barely enough for life, even if you do not turn on the heating at all in the winter. <br><br>  Behind Evgeny the designer Semen made a speech.  He began to talk about God, the heavens and the imperishable soul, which was already completely through no gate.  And then it dawned on Victor.  ‚ÄúWait, wait,‚Äù he thought.  - Hardening is a direct saving on hot water and heating.  But it can be turned differently. " <br><br>  ‚Äú... After all, it was not for nothing that Jesus said that it is just as difficult for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven as a camel is to go through the eye of a needle. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThere is a way,‚Äù said Victor softly. <br>  - What?  - asked confused Eugene. <br>  - I say, there is another way.  Moreover, in this life, - repeated Victor a little louder.  - The fact is that you need to look at the situation from the other side.  I am not talking about our attitude to it now, ‚Äùhe quickly recovered, catching disappointment in his views.  - I'm about marketing.  We are missing the main trend.  In an era of incessant post-industrial crisis and constant job cuts as a result of the new technological revolution, everything that allows you to save money will be in steady demand.  Hardening allows you to save on heating and hot water - he nodded at Eugene.  - Vegetarians, - here he looked at Irina, - do not buy the most expensive meat products.  Physical culture and sport can improve health and do without expensive medicine and treatment for as long as possible, he said, looking into Elena‚Äôs eyes.  ‚ÄúWe just need to file it differently, and that's not all!‚Äù  We can unite in a larger structure.  Create a network and offer a complete solution.  I send my clientele to you, and you to me.  So we will wake up our competitors, at least for a while. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt makes sense,‚Äù Elena said thoughtfully after a pause.  - How about facebook?  You like my posts, I - yours. <br>  ‚ÄúBy all means,‚Äù Victor answered. <br>  ‚ÄúI'm in business,‚Äù said Irina.  - How about creating a separate portal and name? <br>  - Wait, - said Semen.  - I, of course, am happy for you, the idea looks attractive, but where is it, for Christ's sake, interior design? <br>  ‚ÄúThis is not important,‚Äù Elena replied suddenly.  - Principle is important.  Are you a designer?  You will design something that will demand better interiors.  Clothing design for urban cyclists, for example.  You draw a model, an order for small wholesale sewing is sent to China through alibaba.  Implement through Facebook.  We are promoting you with might and main, and you are us. <br>  ‚ÄúLet's say, but interior design and clothing design are not the same thing,‚Äù said Simon timidly. <br>  ‚ÄúI agree with you,‚Äù said Victor.  - Maybe not one.  But you can graduate and retrain, the areas are adjacent.  The main thing - the demand! <br><br>  ‚ÄúAnd we will find you something to do,‚Äù Victor turned to Paul the photographer.  - In the end, someone will have to provide us with quality photos anyway.  Whether we will be ready to pay for it in cash or whether we will work out your work with public relations is an open question.  The main thing is different.  Friends!  Together we have reached a turning point!  The situation is under our control, and we are free to do whatever we want.  We no longer see the world in gloomy tones and are ready to take the next step.  Now we have to consolidate what has been achieved.  Join hands!  - Victor stretched his arms to the side and waited for the circle to close.  And now let's sing. <br><br>  Smile gloomy day brighter, <br>  A smile in the sky will wake the rainbow. <br>  Share your smile <br>  And she will come back to you more than once! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372563/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372563/</a></p>
