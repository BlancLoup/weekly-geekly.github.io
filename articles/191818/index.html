Making the Time Machine by HG Wells</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee1/73c/738/ee173c738b44123cde9bc7c85cdb7c0c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>HG Wells</b> is a world-wide prophet.  According to Wikipedia, he predicted the four-dimensional space-time of Minkowski, the war with the use of aviation, the atomic bomb, parallel worlds and anti-gravity.  About the computing technology in the article does not say. <br>  I propose to fill this (modest against the background of outstanding merits) gap in the predictions and imagine what colors the famous ‚ÄúTime Machine‚Äù could play, turn out to be Herbert Wells a little more perspicacious. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, the Time Traveler falls into the eight hundred and second millennium, where he is surrounded by fragile and naive people of the future - <b>eloi</b> . <br><br>  <i>One of these feminine creatures pulled out of the folds of clothing a rectangle with rounded edges about the size of a book, but much thinner.</i>  <i>Then she gently touched a thin finger to the surface of the rectangle, and that, to my great amazement, began to shine with a delicate bluish light.</i>  <i>Seeing how surprised I was, the Eloy smiled innocently and turned the entire rounded surface to me, in whose modulations I could make out inscriptions in an unfamiliar language and small pictures, all this against the background of a charming landscape.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Eloy touched one of the pictures on the surface of the rectangle with his finger, then another and another.</i>  <i>Thanks to the touch - I saw it quite clearly - the inscriptions and pictures changed: some increased, while others, unnecessary, slid aside so as not to interfere with the view.</i>  <i>In one of the opened squares, an image of another eloi appeared, so authentic that for a moment it seemed to me that I was looking in a mirror reflecting the actual events taking place.</i>  <i>The image of eloj moved along the surface and, as it seemed to me for a moment, at the sight of me, I cried out in surprise.</i>  <i>The expressive laughter of the creatures that surrounded me confirmed that it was so.</i>  <i>I could not believe it for a long time, but when the image of eloi on a rectangular surface, in response to my English phrases, answered in its melodious language, I had to admit that at least they heard me.</i>  <i>I really saw a human being and, because the creature in turn saw me, communicated with it by means of flat rectangles with a luminous surface!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Subsequently, I repeatedly observed how the creatures of the future with the help of these devices not only talk, but also listen to beautiful music played on instruments unknown to me, or put colored cubes falling from above into columns.</i>  <i>Sometimes the cubes burst, and the columns fell down, but falling down on top, like snowflakes, the cubes quickly filled the gap.</i>  <i>The columns grew and grew as long as they had enough space - then the fall of the cubes stopped.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Being by nature an inventor, I could not help but become interested in the device of wonderful rectangles, but as a result of several attempts I became convinced that Eloys knew nothing about the principles of their operation.</i>  <i>Eloi knew how to control the devices, swiping his finger over the desired picture or inscription, or pronouncing in a quiet voice of the command.</i>  <i>But when I tried to explain to beings from the future that I wanted to familiarize myself with the internal mechanism of the device, they shrugged their shoulders in reply and continued their studies.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúHell-minh, hell-min‚Äù, - sometimes they cooed among themselves, believing in the simplicity of the soul that this word explains everything.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Despite the annoying mutual misunderstanding, eloi willingly, although for a short time borrowed glowing rectangles, so that I could play with them.</i>  <i>From this rarely what worked.</i>  <i>I drove my finger along the smooth, pleasant to the touch surface, changing the inscriptions and pictures in response, but because I did not know Eloi language, I could not understand what each of them meant, and the pictures were too conditional to be guided by them.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>After one incident in the dining room, I finally concluded that the luminous rectangles were not invented and constructed by eloi.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Somehow during the meal there was an indignant cry: one of the diners ran his finger along the surface of his rectangle, but the surface, contrary to expectations, did not shine.</i>  <i>I decided that the rectangle had broken, and, satisfied, prepared to watch it be repaired.</i>  <i>However, with an eloj, without thinking twice, he threw a rectangle into a rounded hole next to the tables, where food was thrown, then ran to the closet in the hall and pulled out a completely new and healthy rectangle.</i>  <i>His indignation at the breakdown was immediately replaced by cheers, and the creature of the future, as if nothing had happened, began to talk with one of her friends in the new apparatus.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>There was no shortage of luminous eloi in glowing rectangles: each had its own rectangle, usually white, pink or black.</i>  <i>It is curious that on the back of the apparatus - I had the opportunity to examine it in detail, since I took several different machines in my hands - there was an image of a fruit, a bit like an orange, and bitten.</i>  <i>Drawing attention to this strange fact, I tried to inquire about him and even received some hope when the first person asked by an eli nodded kindly and ran off somewhere headlong.</i>  <i>I decided that he ran for a thing that would clarify the meaning of the bitten fruit, or at least for a knowledgeable person.</i>  <i>As it turned out, he ran away behind the fruit with an eloj: after a minute, he returned, carrying a large ripe fruit in his hand, then bit hard, as shown in the figure, and with a satisfied look stretched out to me.</i>  <i>The creature decided that I ask to bring some bitten food!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>People of the future - they were like children, and I had no idea what was behind the facade of their carefree life.</i>

      You can choose a suitable role for <b>Morlok</b> , for example such. <br>  In order to clarify the situation, the Time Traveler descends into a deep mine-well, where he meets ape-like inhabitants of the underworld. <br><br>  <i>Exhausted and almost repentant of his enterprise, I opened my fingers, jumped to the floor and was finally able to look around where I was.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>There was no need for matches, because the cave opened to my eyes was illuminated by a dull bluish light coming from rectangles with rounded edges.</i>  <i>However, these rectangles were not in the hands of underground inhabitants: fixed vertically on the ribs, they shone from the black tables that filled the cave.</i>  <i>The rectangles were three times the largest of those used by the friendly eloi, and not pacifying pictures moved along them, but drawings and mathematical formulas full of strange symbols.</i>  <i>They didn‚Äôt entertain themselves underground - here the important constructive work was in full swing, God knows what.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>At first, he paid attention only to the luminous screens, at the second he noticed a lot of Morlocks, slouched behind the luminous rectangles in the low seats.</i>  <i>Inhabitants of the underworld, squinting with eyes that were watery from the light, peered into their full-size rectangles and, as it were, among other things, sifted their gouty fingers along the boards lying side by side and completely dotted with small black squares.</i>  <i>In accordance with the movements of Morlok, the mysterious formulas on the luminous rectangles were transformed: new branches were added to some formulas, others, under the influx of new formulas, fell down and disappeared from sight.</i>  <i>With a smooth movement of the wheel located on the board, the Morlocks could have caused the failed formulas from nonexistence, eliminating the above.</i>  <i>Interestingly, the Morlocks, in contrast to the Eloi, were not touched by the luminous rectangles themselves, apparently considering it to be trivial, unworthy of an underground resident as entertainment.</i>  <i>Depth in everything, productivity and efficiency of work - this, as far as I understood, was the motto of the inhabitants of future dungeons.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Expensive, I would give to understand the device of the luminous aggregates of Morlok and solve their insane formulas, but circumstances did not allow to hope for cooperation.</i>  <i>First one, then the second and third Morlocks noticed me and, squinting from blindness, turned their heads suspiciously in my direction.</i>  <i>A sigh of faint surprise rustled from the black seats.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúHaskell?‚Äù One of the Morlocks whispered interrogatively to me.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I answered with a few words of the Eloy language, which I had previously memorized, but they had an unpleasant effect on Morlok.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúJava?‚Äù Asked another, straining a little.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I answered again, already anticipating the evil.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúBASIC?‚Äù, Several indignant voices shouted at once.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Then I drew attention to the long table, located between the luminous rectangles, very close to me.</i>  <i>A piece of smoked meat was lying on the table, half-wrapped in colored matter, which I did not recognize at first, but a second later I was horrified to find that matter was very much like a dress worn by the fragile inhabitants of the Earth‚Äôs sunny side.</i>  <i>Next to the piece of meat were golden cylinders with a fist of magnitude, which smelled of beer ‚Äî at some point I even thought that I was in a provincial Scottish pub ‚Äî and handfuls of small nuts were scattered around the table.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Having drawn conclusions from what I saw, I shuddered in disgust and looked up at the underground creatures, who were already rising from their black chairs and heading towards me, moving their fingers twisting threateningly.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúYus-s-sir!</i>  <i>Yus-s-sir! ‚Äù- rustled under the arches of the cave.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Negotiations were useless.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I turned to the attackers with my back, trying to find in the well darkness surrounding me the brackets, which penetrated the dungeon, and when I managed to do it, I tried to pull myself up.</i>  <i>However, several of the Morlocks who had already managed to get close to my legs.</i>  <i>I kicked the top of them with a heel, and when the damned loosened my grip, I was able to pull myself up and put my foot against the wall.</i>  <i>Then, using the staples, I quickly climbed up the impenetrable well, up to the lightening above me and, as I advanced, an increasing point.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúYus-s-sir!</i>  <i>Yus-s-sir! ‚Äù- the irreconcilable hissing came to me from below.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Oh, now it dawned on me who made fancy rectangles with rounded edges, which were used by the inhabitants of the solar world, and what paid eloi for their sophisticated entertainment!</i>  <i>Over the centuries, the production of the Earth went underground, but there was no food for the producers, and the problem was solved with all the thoroughness and efficiency that are characteristic of the starving proletarians.</i> <br><br>  If HG Wells had depicted something similar, he would have stood on a par with Leonardo da Vinci.  Why, why did the writer fail to mention computing equipment and a bitten fruit - a bitten fruit in particular - in ‚ÄúThe Time Machine‚Äù - didn‚Äôt intuition suggest? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/191818/">https://habr.com/ru/post/191818/</a></p>
