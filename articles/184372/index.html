It's time to write a sequel!  So, what do I need from the developer's resume? <br><br>  Everything is lower in order of priority. <br><br><h4>  Code </h4><br>  <b>I want to see the code that you are proud of</b> .  I want to know how you name the variables, how to decompose the system, how to check the input conditions and how much you like to complicate things.  It is very desirable if there is a description of the problem, otherwise the understanding of the code and solution is difficult. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If you have an account on GitHub - great.  If not - archive in zip will do (do not use rar for this purpose, please).  If you have everything under the NDA - well, anything can happen, in this case we will do without a code.

    <h4>  Blog, articles, books </h4><br>  If you have a blog, include a link to it.  If you have articles on any topic - include links to them in the summary.  It is very interesting to see <b>how a person puts his thoughts on paper</b> .  If you wrote a book - include a link to it in the summary. <br><br><h4>  Your interests, books and resources </h4><br>  I want to know what you read, <b>how you deepen your knowledge in your craft</b> .  If you have an account on Shelfari or another similar resource - great ( <a href="http://www.shelfari.com/mdubakov">I have one</a> ).  No, then I would like to see in the list a few books that have had a great influence on you.  Well, for example, SICP or Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture, or something else. <br><br>  Even so (it can be shorter): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/489/d20/80b/489d2080ba5d28f40481ee5b0592da5a.jpg"><br><br>  Such a list immediately makes it clear what the person is interested in.  It helps to better prepare for the conversation, to ask more interesting and deep questions.  If you don't read books, well, anything can happen.  But I, perhaps, with caution will look at you when you first met.  And it will be extremely interesting for me to learn how you develop.  Maybe you are at leisure studying the code of open source projects.  Or immersed in fresh preprints on <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arxiv.org</a> . <br><br>  In a pinch, something like this description will do: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ed6/648/da2/ed6648da2abd2e240c567bb56b9f1a85.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Brevity </h4><br>  No need to repeat, no need to describe in detail all the projects where you have been working for the last 10 years.  There is no need to repeat the entire list of technologies and an even more identical set of responsibilities in each project.  Describe <b>only the most interesting projects for you</b> and tell why they were interesting for you, what problems you solved there (at a high level). <br><br>  Your desire to emphasize your own importance with the volume of the resume <s>does</s> not work.  I understand that writing a 4 page summary is easier than one. <br><br><h4>  Technology </h4><br>  Skill tables don't interest me.  But here is a <b>simple list of technologies where you are an expert</b> - completely.  He takes a little space and helps to understand what it makes sense to ask a person, and about what - no. <br><br>  Here is a list of very valid, well, a little bit could be reduced: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4b0/944/e7a/4b0944e7a3c968e3f00a3f2aa687cf58.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Fighting way </h4><br>  I wonder where you studied and when.  I wonder which companies you worked for and how often they changed jobs.  If a person changes jobs every 6 months, this will alert me (if there are no clear explanations for the reasons).  If a change occurs every year, then it is within the normal range.  If a person has spent 5+ years in one place (which, I must say, is rare), you need to take a closer look at his outlook (it may happen that in 5 years there was little varied work, which is not particularly good, although everything depends on the context). <br><br><h4>  Registration </h4><br>  By and large, I do not care what the font will be in the resume and what dash in the sentences.  I understand that programmers are not always close to aesthetics, that they hardly read books on typography and design.  For me, it is important that the summary will either: <br><br>  a) is available online by reference (and there is also a link to the PDF version somewhere). <br>  b) sent in pdf format. <br><br>  Ease of design is welcome. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  The perfect resume is a 1-2 pages of information written in human language for other people.  <b>It is very important for me to see a person in the resume</b> , not a robot with stitched skills.  Help me do it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/184372/">https://habr.com/ru/post/184372/</a></p>
