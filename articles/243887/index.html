Even as the exam for the CCENT certification underwent significant changes.  The previous similar exam, 640-822, was canceled on October 1 and replaced by 100-101 ICND1.  The new 100-101 ICND1 includes materials previously related to more advanced levels. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  One and a half months before passing the exam, I developed a reasonable training plan and laboratory exercises.  I watched an instructional video every day for hours, prepared flash cards, and also worked with the equipment.  As it turned out, I spent more than a hundred hours preparing for exams, which I did not expect.

      In the morning before the exam, I decided to double-check the time of the exam and realized that I signed up for 100-101.  But it was too late to correct the error.  I would be preparing for the updated ICND1, and not for the old so soon replaced.  I spent a lot of time looking for the difference between the two training programs. <br><br>  Fortunately, certification guidelines are not hard to find.  Cisco Press provides a wide range of products, and numerous courses are available on the website.  I used materials from CBT Nuggets courses that offer online training throughout the entire preparation period.  I found that a combination of web-based courses along with official exam guides provide a practical side to learning.  Based on my experience, video training is especially useful for beginners new topics.  It serves as the basis for what will be further explained in the manual. <br><br>  My advice to those who will take the test: whatever you use, make sure that the practical tests are available to you.  Test your knowledge and use the maximum amount of resources.  Repeat as necessary. <br><br>  This way you can find something that puzzles you and what you need to work on more.  After a while, patterns within the functions and protocols become noticeable.  I will not spoil - just know that everything is formed [1].  Work on subnets and addressing as much as you can ( <i>comment perev .: oh, to whom as, it is the easiest</i> ).  I would say that subnetting or understanding network addressing is something that needs to be understood as early as possible.  It is very useful to make a table of subnets (memory charts) from memory, before starting the exam.  However, you should be able, at least vaguely, to describe all the topics from the curriculum, which is available on the Cisco training network site. <br><br>  This is a difficult exam, but only in terms of time.  Time management will be a problem until you finish the exam ( <i>comment perev .: yes, you panic that there will not be enough time for simlet if it is about that</i> ). <br><br>  My best work is to jump from one topic to another, which may seem insane.  This probably explains my emphasis on the accumulation of various materials.  But seriously, such a broad approach is useful in perspective and can facilitate the repetition of the material.  Make your training schedule in the most convenient way for you.  If there is not enough time to prepare, divide the training into parts.  Before passing the exam, I built a subnet chart at least three times a day.  It takes only a few minutes and helps her greatly to remember. <br><br>  Yes, the 100-101 ICND1 is an entry-level exam, but this does not mean that it should not be taken seriously.  Much, if not all, of what will be in subsequent exams will be built around the topics of this exam.  IPv6, NAT, ACL, etc.  introduced in ICND1 and will be presented in more detail at the next, advanced levels.  I would not advise you to attach any shortcuts to this initial exam. <br><br>  Of course, not for me to say - I reworked tons of new material in 10 hours.  But I passed. <br><br>  [1] - After a while, patterns become noticeable within functions and protocols.  I won‚Äôt just know that everything builds. <br><br>  A couple of tips from the translator: <br><br>  0. Learn English (first of all to the translator, yes =)).  If an unfamiliar word comes across in an exam, it is sad, one pretext can completely change the meaning of a sentence. <br>  1. Follow the time during the exam and leave most on the simlet.  Especially if they are at the end.  Who knows how many of them can get caught during the exam.  I think lucky. <br>  2. Get enough sleep.  (Hmm ... it must be p.00). <br>  3. Before choosing and paying for the exam <b>,</b> check <b>everything</b> : the exam number itself - as the author‚Äôs experience shows;  call in advance in the test center - even if the site allows you to select it as a delivery point.  I had to postpone the exam.  It is expensive to call abroad (there are no other ways), besides, ‚Äúdeaf telephones‚Äù are obtained - neither they understand you, nor you them. <br><br>  <b>Useful links:</b> <br><br>  1. <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/133453/">Networks for the smallest</a> <br>  2. <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/155329/">Short Notes on Cisco CCNA (Part ICND1)</a> <br>  3. <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/129542/">Missing (top 10 useful commands not included in the CCNA course)</a> <br>  4. <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/231595/">GNS3 1.0 beta Early Release is now available to everyone.</a> <br>  5. <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/158315/">Independently prepare for CCNA: practical advice</a> <br>  6. <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/skillfactory/blog/168595/">Step-by-step guide on "How to take the Cisco exam?"</a> <br>  7. <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/174167/">Do you know static routing well?</a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/243887/">https://habr.com/ru/post/243887/</a></p>
