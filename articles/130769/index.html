  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to Make Your Own Mobile Phone Suppressor</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I work in a small company that promotes websites on the Internet (SEO).  Most recently, we began to practice a new method of attracting workers.  We organize small presentations - seminars (free of charge) where we talk about various aspects of search engine optimization and thus attract young collaborators to collaboration.  On average, about 20-30 people gather in our office once a week.  In the beginning, everything was just fine, but then, we unexpectedly ran into one problem. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When, in the midst of a seminar, a mobile phone starts ringing at someone, this greatly distracts the attention of not only the speaker, but also the entire audience.  Thus, 3-4 calls within an hour and a seminar can be considered a failure.  All calls to turn off the phones at the entrance to the hall do not help.  So we decided to use a cellular suppressor.  The price of a suppressor with a suppression radius of 30-40 meters (just the size of our audience) costs about $ 500.  However, I decided not to spend this amount and collect it myself.  Began to look for schemes.  In my search, I came across a <a href="http://www.jammer.su/">Jammer</a> article called <a href="http://blog.jammer.su/2011/10/instrukcija-kak-sdelat-sobstvennuju-glushilku-sotovoj-svjazi/">Instruction: How to Make Your Own Cell Phone Jammer</a> .  She inspired me to make such a device for personal use. <br><br>  In this article I found all the necessary information, diagrams and photos, so it was worth a try.  The attempt was successful, and its result is presented further. <br><br>  <b>Principle of operation</b>

      This mobile phone suppressor operates on the GSM800 frequency, since most mobile phones also use this frequency.  So the selected VCO is a sweep frequency generator, which is very efficient, but it can be hard to make yourself if you are a beginner and do not have good equipment. <br>  As a source of interference, I used a 45 MHz clock signal generator, which excites the local oscillator port of the receiver, located on the chip.  There is also a resistance impedance network so that the local oscillator signal of the receiver passes through it.  This is done in order to equalize the resistance of the clock generator and the local oscillator port. <br>  The RF input (the same local oscillator port) is connected to a 800 MHz antenna, and the RF output is sent to a signal amplifier.  This amplifier boosts the output power by 15‚Äì16 dBm.  Then the amplified signal is sent to the second antenna. <br><br>  <b>How it works?</b> <br><br>  For all mobile phones operating on the GSM800 frequency, the frequencies of the sent and received signals are always different at 45 MHz.  So when a cell phone tries to reach you somewhere, its own signal returns and blocks it!  When someone chatters with a cell phone gets you - turn on your suppressor and this person will hear only his own voice in his cell phone. <br>  By the way, you can also use your cell phone jammer to block any tracking systems based on cellular communications, which use GPS for tracking and mobile communications for recording received data.  And it is quite possible (thank God, it‚Äôs not yet possible to check) for the suppression of IEDs (Self-made Explosive Devices), which are detonated by mobile phones. <br><br>  <b>Photos and Notes</b> <br><br><img src="http://img412.imageshack.us/img412/6287/photo1gn.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I used a frequency converter rated up to 600 MHz, but with a few changes it came up. <br><br><img src="http://img834.imageshack.us/img834/356/photo2gby.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The RF amplifier ideally does its job, but (as noted in an article on the blog) uses more power. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7df/3fb/d9a/7df3fbd9a78fa928c68a89165372efac.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As a case, I used the old aluminum packaging, as well as the old VHF connectors from the Motorola phone for input and output. <br><br><img src="http://img819.imageshack.us/img819/839/photo4nq.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is necessary to solder the VHF connectors to the chip. <br><br><img src="http://img854.imageshack.us/img854/680/photo5foj.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A nine-volt battery and a voltage regulator were used to power all the components.  The battery was separated from the rest by foam. <br><br><img src="http://img3.imageshack.us/img3/120/photo6wru.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On top of the case is located on / off switch.  The input and output antennas (from the same old Motorola) are connected to the VHF connectors. <br><br><img src="http://img805.imageshack.us/img805/2893/photo7db.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Your mobile phone jammer is ready.  Enjoy!  I have not tested it in our audience yet, but in my apartment it crushes the phone at a distance of about 10 meters. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130769/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130769/</a></p>
