  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Earn in cyber war</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is well known that timely received insider information about the successes and failures of large corporations with the right gambling can bring the owner millions.  And who, if not hackers, have the opportunity to extract such information or to influence the activities of companies themselves by hacking into important business systems?  So why not make money on your knowledge during the forum <a href="http://www.phdays.ru/">Positive Hack Days V</a> ? <br><br>  This year, PHDays participants will be able to join the life of the United States of Soviet Unions (USSU) state by selling and buying securities on the PHDays Stock Market.  Not only participants of CTF and other contests, but also all visitors to the forum will be able to trade shares of ‚Äúcorporations‚Äù represented in competitions (directly or through a broker) and use insider information to play on the stock exchange. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Participants in hacker contests will be able to influence stock quotes by breaking into a railroad, an electrical substation, websites of news agencies, and other resources.  In addition, with successful hacking you can find useful information. <br><br>  To spend game currency it will be possible to purchase drinks at the bar and souvenirs.  For more details, contact our specialists, who will be at the bar counter of the congress hall of the World Trade Center on May 26 and 27.

However, the fifth CTF will be unlike all previous as well as any other competitions.  The head distinctive feature is the exchange PHDays Stock Market.  However, technically this is the usual task-based CTF, with some assumptions and innovations. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/656/2f0/416/6562f04166894ab7bbffda91c9c32024.png"></a> <br><br>  According to the 2015 scenario, the team represents a hacker group operating in the USSU state, which has its own energy, transport, telecommunications, banking system, media, as well as a stock exchange, which is the basis of the state‚Äôs economic and political life. <br><br>  To win, teams need to perform various tasks received at DarkNet's underground labor exchange, for example, intercept GSM traffic between an ATM and processing (Leave ATM Alone contests), push trains (Choo Choo Pwn) or detect the CEO of a large corporation (Competitive Intelligence) .  Having hacked corporations, participants can profit from buying and selling stocks that are traded on the stock exchange: the attacks affect the quotes, and the insider information obtained by hacking helps to choose a winning strategy. <br><br>  You can compromise the resources of companies both from the Internet (Competitive Intelligence and WAF Bypass contests) and locally while on the site (Leave ATM Alone, Hacknet and other contests). <br><br>  CTF members may not share their exploits with anyone and use this knowledge when trading on the stock exchange or, as in real life, selling exploits on the BlackMarket hacker forum.  In addition, it will be possible to receive remuneration for the transferred advisory at the USSU State Center for Incident Monitoring and Investigation (CERT). <br><br>  For advisory, transferred to CERT, and orders from Darknet, teams will receive virtual currency - public, and the one who collects the most will win the CTF. <br><br>  Another CTF feature this year: in addition to the teams invited by the organizers, other forum members can join the game.  If you have a ticket for PHDays and you want to create your team, you can register at any time until the first day of the forum (May 26, 09:00 Moscow time).  To do this, it‚Äôs enough to assemble a team of at least three forum participants and register by writing to phd [at] ptsecurity.com information about your team. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.phdays.ru/program/ctf/">www.phdays.ru/program/ctf</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/258681/">https://habr.com/ru/post/258681/</a></p>
