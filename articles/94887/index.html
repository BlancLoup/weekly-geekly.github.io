      Granted, the layout is terrible.  The front page generally folded on the last day ... :) <br>  Layout of the second issue was much better and the cover is colored. <br><br>  <b>Office</b> <br>  A small office was filmed for only 3000 rubles a month. <br>  In the city center, on Lenin Street, in the House of Life. <br><br>  <b>Marketing</b> <br>  An advertisement was posted on the Ren-TV channel (local broadcasting). <br>  It seems that 20 exits of advertising cost 1500 rubles. <br>  I made the video myself in flash + I also voiced it myself in my teenage voice :) <br>  Unfortunately, the video itself on the old hard drive, which I now have nothing to read. <br><br>  <b>Print</b> <br>  At that moment I remember three live printing presses in the city. <br>  I agreed with one of them for 2500 rubles / 999 copies. <br>  By the way, who does not know, a newspaper with a circulation of up to 1000 copies can be printed without a license. <br><br>  <b>Spread</b> <br>  With the proliferation of print media in Makhachkala, the trouble is that Rospechat holds a monopoly, which takes half the cost of publication.  To work with them, it was required at least to be an IE. <br>  No problem!  I went to the village (at the place of registration) and registered. <br>  By the way, for this, I had to conduct an emancipation with a notary with one of the parents. <br>  As a result, an agreement was concluded with Rospechat. <br><br>  In general, at this age it was difficult to work with people - they just did not understand the joke, as I, lad, can release a newspaper alone ... And I, too, was embarrassed. <br><br>  Somehow, a couple of years later, a man wrote to me.  The domain through me registered. <br>  I saw that he was my countryman.  We talked.  It turned out he worked in the advertising agency, where I often visited.  I will order business cards, then I will post a ticker or a logo on TV. <br>  The coolest thing he remembered me! <br>  He says, "I'm sorry, but the whole office laughed at you."  This is how ... <br>  Every now and then, it was necessary to catch oblique views. <br><br>  But back to our sheep. <br><br>  <b>Layout and selection of material</b> <br>  I did this myself.  The work, at first glance, is not difficult, but in fact it is hellish work, if you need to fill all 16 lanes yourself in 5 days. <br>  Information was completely taken from the network. <br>  The newspaper was A4 format.  With the A3 format, I certainly would not have done it alone. <br>  Wired up at his laptop, sitting in a dull office at a single table. <br>  From software, only Adobe InDesign was used, which I mastered during typing at random :) <br><br>  <b>Search advertisers</b> <br>  Due to my inexperience, I missed this moment altogether. <br>  As a child, I naively believed that the advertiser himself would find me :) <br>  There were several places in the newspaper, such as, ‚Äúyour ad could have been here‚Äù. <br>  Dead number, I'll tell you :) <br>  Later, I found out that only active marketing works well, because even large editions hire managers who call the company from the yellow pages and offer to be accommodated. <br><br>  <b>First week after release</b> <br>  Euphoria.  Joy.  A little bit of pride. <br>  Dad bought a dozen copies, distributed to close relatives. <br>  My younger brother and I went to the kiosks a couple of times, asking if the Good News newspaper was for sale? <br>  By the way, according to the announcement that I placed in the first issue, a man called me! <br>  So someone bought a newspaper, damn it!  :) <br><br>  <b>The final</b> <br>  When I finished the second number and carried it to the printing press on a flash drive, my parents dissuaded me. <br>  It is good, because the probability of a positive development of events was negligible. <br>  Later, I did not even take the money from Rospechat. <br><br>  <b>Morality</b> <br>  Yes, I did not earn money by releasing this newspaper, but I tried! <br>  Good to look for reasons!  We got up and went to print newspapers! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94887/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94887/</a></p>
