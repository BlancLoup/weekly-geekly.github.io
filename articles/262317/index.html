      This year (for the second time), the Department of <b>ECiEMM</b> carries out admission to a new promising direction <i><b>Applied Mathematics and Computer Science with a specialization in the field of economic and mathematical methods</b></i> .  Studying in this direction, in the first two courses, students receive advanced <b>in-depth general mathematical and computer training</b> , studying, Mathematical Analysis, Higher and Linear Algebra, and Analytical Geometry, High Level Programming Languages, Discrete Mathematics, Differential Equations, Computer Mathematical Media, Functional Analysis, Theory functions of a complex variable, probability theory and mathematical statistics.  In senior courses, students study a large block of applied economic disciplines, including: Game Theory, Econometrics, Financial Mathematics, Actuarial Mathematics, Mathematical Modeling, Operations Research, Decision Theory, Forecasting Methods, Models of Economic Dynamics, Scheduling and Revenue Management, Multivariate statistical analysis, simulation modeling and other disciplines. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  From other economic and even economic and mathematical areas, such as ‚ÄúMathematical Methods in Economics‚Äù, ‚ÄúApplied Informatics in Economics‚Äù, ‚ÄúBusiness Informatics‚Äù, and others. Applied Mathematics and Informatics differs <b>significantly more in-depth and advanced</b> training in <b>mathematics</b> , <b>computer science</b> and <b>programming</b> .  Our difference from other universities that implement the training of specialists in the field of ‚ÄúApplied Mathematics and Informatics‚Äù consists in a broader (often, substantially broader) <b>economic-mathematical</b> and <b>general economic</b> training.  Among the economic disciplines can be distinguished such advanced courses as Microeconomics Macroeconomics, Management, Marketing, Project Management, Finance and Credit, Securities Market, Logistics and Supply Chain Management, Business Valuation Methods, Financial Management.  Let us dare to assert that <b>not a single faculty in St. Petersburg</b> , which is engaged in the preparation of applied mathematicians, <b>can boast such a deep orientation and extensive training in the field of mathematical economics</b> .  In this case, the orientation of our students in the field of economic and mathematical research begins in the first year, when, when studying mathematical analysis or algebra, students are also told how the material studied can be applied in economics. <br><br>  An important distinctive feature of training at the department is the <b>deep integration of the computer algebra system Wolfram Mathematica into the educational process</b> .  SPbGEU became the first university in Russia to acquire an unlimited license for this software.  So, all our students have a unique opportunity <b>to</b> use the <b>official licensed version of Wolfram Mathematica</b> for <b>free</b> , not only at the university, but also <b>at home</b> ! <br><br>  The <b>Center Wolfram-technology in education was</b> opened on the basis of St. Petersburg State University of Economics in close cooperation with the Department of ECiEMM.  The head of the Center is the Head of the Department of ECiEMM, Dr. Sc.  GM Fridman, so far the only winner of the Wolfram Innovator award in Russia.  The staff of the center is certified instructors, among them is the head of the laboratory for the implementation of Wolfram technologies in Ph.D.  Leonid Shifrin, kernel developer and author of one of the most popular books on programming in Wolfram Mathematica.  With the direct participation of the center's staff, three <b>All-Russian conferences</b> devoted to the use of Wolfram technologies were held at the St. Petersburg State University of Power Engineering, and <b>Stephen Wolfram</b> himself spoke at the first conference with a separate report! <br><br>  The educational process at the department is constructed in such a way that our students become familiar with the <b>Wolfram Mathematica</b> system already in their first year and do not part with it <b>until the end of their studies</b> .  Perhaps in no university in Russia there are so many courses that would be studied using Wolfram Mathematica. <br><br>  Students who have shown a penchant for scientific activity have the opportunity to participate in the work of the <b>Center for Operations Research</b> , headed by a <b>professor at the University.</b>  <b>Pompeu Fabre</b> (Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãSpain) Kalyan Talluri - one of the world's largest experts in the field of revenue management. <br><br>  Please note that due to the richness of the curriculum and deep mathematical training, our specialty is probably the most difficult at the university.  We are waiting for strong motivated applicants who have a <b>penchant for mathematics</b> , are not afraid of difficulties and are ready to study in a <b>complex</b> and <b>rich</b> , but <b>interesting</b> and <b>promising interdisciplinary program</b> .  If you are not afraid of difficulties, are ready to work on the result, then come to us and you will surely not regret it! <br><br>  More detailed information can be found on the <a href="http://unecon.ru/priem-2015">website of the</a> Admissions Committee of Saint-Petersburg State University of Economics. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/262317/">https://habr.com/ru/post/262317/</a></p>
