    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  First, let's remove the stereotypes.  Recently, everyone thinks that they are teaching to take on the paw from students.  But this is nonsense.  Why?  But why. <br>  How to become a teacher?  They enter graduate school, do something there and try themselves in the role of teacher.  Yes, many enroll in graduate school because of the army, and these people are forced to teach.  BUT!  According to the federal component, a graduate student must spend 100 hours in three years (!).  This is basically one to two courses per semester.  If a person does not want, he will not be forced to work above the norm.  And in one - two semesters all points will be placed above i.  Then a person teaches only on his own initiative.  And his goal is not money from students.  Because while he is a graduate student, he definitely will not take money. <br><br>  Yes, of course there are people who teach out of selfish motives, but this is more the exception than the rule. <br><br>  Next, it turns out that the teacher teaches, and looks at the students.  He is beginning to understand a lot.  Understands that the majority of students are not adapted to the lumps that you don‚Äôt want to teach, because all the work will disappear into oblivion.  And do not forget that all the same salary at the teacher is not great, more enthusiastic. <br><br>  Enthusiasm is based on the fact that you can give something.  It is here that clever guy or girl, in general, a student who will say thank you for what you are doing. <br><br>  But no.  For a long time already students see in everything only incompetence of the teacher or his nonsense.  Students think they are right about any subject.  Now the teacher finds fault, then something else is wrong.  And now let's face it, if you know and understand the subject, then there will be no problems. <br><br>  The same post about the girl who came to pass the lab, but the teacher sent her to do something else.  The essence of that post is that the girl does not understand, cannot understand, because in the first place she will not work in her specialty, and secondly she cannot do something herself.  So it turns out that the teacher does not want to rate the student, he did not deserve it.  On the other hand, I don‚Äôt want to deduct, because it can ruin a child‚Äôs life.  Feel what a problem? <br><br>  So it turns out that the teacher should be a humane person, but demanding, even a little bit tough (not cruel :-)) and fair.  If a person tries, it may be worthwhile to push him further, to give more tasks.  If a person really tries, he will accept these tasks with joy, who does not - will be flogged, and write about what the teachers are unfair. <br><br>  What should a teacher teach?  Teach to work first.  Do not be lazy and work.  And it is worth remembering the ancient teachers.  Which were very wise.  They wanted to show students different situations and teach them to go out.  For example, to show what is injustice, what is a lie.  But this is so, note, we are not about that. <br><br>  The teacher must be competent, but there are teachers who do not understand anything.  But this is not often and most often only some graduate students.  Because the defense of the Ph.D. already implies no small immersion in the subject area.  There is nothing to say about doctors at all. <br><br>  But very often I hear that, they say, yes, he is a clever man, but he cannot explain.  Let's think, should a doctor of any sciences be a good speaker?  Certainly yes.  And what's more, in my memory there is not a single candidate or doctor who could not speak well.  Yes, of course, to understand him you need to have knowledge, and sometimes considerable ones, but these people know a lot about their field and it is important for us to absorb these words like a sponge, because they share really smart things with us.  Yes, maybe he does not know how to explain what he does without incomprehensible terms and words.  Simply he is different and can not.  While we are listening to lectures, we need to understand the teacher, and for this you should sit at home, look at some terms, read books, develop in the required direction. <br><br>  Yes, I am for the fact that teachers would be trained in the direction of pedagogy, all the same it is a science and there is a lot of interesting things there.  But in our universities this is often not the case.  This is a minus.  But in this there is one small plus sign, teachers do not try to adapt to the student, the student must adapt to the teacher, and rightly so, this is part of life.  And the university must, in addition to learning, have to make an adult person out of a student who can live in our world. <br><br>  So what happens is that the teacher should be humane, demanding, competent and should be a good speaker.  The worst thing is that some things are very difficult to fit in one person. <br><br>  But no one understands how difficult and responsible it is, everyone talks only about what a bastard you are, you want to deduct me and fill up.  Everyone complains behind their backs and grins.  But after all, this person, your teacher, is much higher than you spiritually and intellectually.  Be human, no one wants evil. <br><br>  So the ideal teacher is a humane, demanding, tough, fair, competent person with oratory, who is treated with respect, he is waiting for this and he deserves it. <br><br>  Probably everything.  Generally it is rather a post from the category of boiling.  But maybe some student will read and understand the purpose of training.  I hope this will be my student.  :-) <br><br>  Here is my personal opinion. <br><br>  Thanks to all.  Ready to argue. <br><br>  PS: I often used the word "teacher", it is not scorn on my part, just to write the word teacher for a long time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77611/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77611/</a></p>
