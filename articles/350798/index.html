"Network Basics".  "The value of Cisco routers."  Eddie Martin  December 2012 </h4><br>  What do your customers think about routing?  Nothing.  It is commercialized.  Routers have been a commodity for many years.  In the 1990s it was their best time; they were still unique then.  At that time, I often changed jobs and I was good at routing in OSPF.  I was more than qualified in this field.  I was constantly changing jobs.  Someone invited me to work, I went, then I was offered a few thousand dollars more and I worked for them.  I was only involved in OSPF, because then it was very important for business leaders.  Now this is done by people from college and even high school, since it is not rocket science.  Then there were no textbooks or manuals on this issue.  We ourselves wrote about how to create these large networks.  It was a great time in the industry, but now routers are a common thing.  If you sell just the ability to send packets or frames from one interface to another, it will not bring any benefits. <br><br>  Second, routers must meet the requirements of the business.  Could you, knowing this and, being sellers, use this when talking about the needs of a business outside IT?  I think yes.  Could you talk about consolidation, speed, deployment?  Of course, about everything, about anything. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o4/px/3y/o4px3yeyl_uzar-jpbegldxavku.jpeg"><br><br>  Cisco is the market leader.  For more than 15 years we have been leaders in the market of routers.  In some categories of routers we have 60 percent, in some 80 percent (when it comes to equipment for branch offices, as we have already spoken with you <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/350712/">here</a> ).  Over the past 15 years, we have had good competition, and it still exists, but customers still come back to us.  How do we do it?  Thanks to innovation.  At first, we began to produce routers and switches, and then we began to help service providers.  IP core, MPLS - this is the innovation of our company.  We gave providers the opportunity to use the IP core, resell bandwidth again and again, to guarantee services.  This has helped us in terms of entrepreneurship, commerce, and this has helped providers with saving income. <br><br>  ISR G2 - in truth the intersection point of architectures, we have already talked about this <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/350752/">in the previous article</a> .  Our ASR routers provided additional capabilities at the hardware level thanks to the new, developed by us, processors and a special ‚Äúhardware‚Äù, which can do all this without delay and with a minimum price for the client.  Now it is possible to deploy this in the form of scalable solutions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4h/cb/ep/4hcbepe1nv_uhojeuauabzvxd8s.jpeg"><br><br>  Support and service.  In this, Cisco is very strong.  On this occasion, I will tell you one story from personal experience.  Then I was a system administrator and was located in Raly-Durham, North Carolina.  It was a vacation and there was another system administrator who had a fairly large client.  The client switched from the older 7200 series of routers to the 7500 series. This happened during the holidays and the engineer who was in charge of him went somewhere outside the city, probably, to rest.  In general, the client wanted to replace the routers and it did not work.  I had to turn everything off and turn it back, and this was a very important client and so I was sent there to solve the problem.  I drove to the place for several hours.  While I was driving, Cisco had already managed to send them 4 or 5 routers with a pre-configured configuration, since we did not know whether it was our product or not, but the replacement did not work, the client complained and it became a Cisco problem.  And here I am, I don‚Äôt know this client and say: ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm Eddie from Cisco, I want to help you‚Äù.  So, the next evening we decided to try again and I looked at their plan, re-analyzed it, everything looked fine.  We start to re-connect everything, move cables and so on.  And here we are done and again does not work.  The client looks at me and says: ‚ÄúHow is it even possible, I bought a new equipment and such a problem arises‚Äù.  I look at him and do not understand, for me it is some kind of nonsense.  Everything turned out literally half an hour later, 15 minutes before it would have had to be brought back, since downtime would have been too big and I really would not want to start all over again.  I worked with one of their chief engineers and we had a 100 megabyte ethernet cable with which we connected all this.  And nothing worked.  I look at the router and I understand that everything is normal with him and the reason is not in him, and I say: ‚ÄúMan, I can‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs wrong with him, I don‚Äôt see any malfunctions‚Äù.  The engineer looked at me and said that he was tired of all this and threw out the plan, and I looked up at him and asked: "Where do you get this cable from?"  He said he made this cable.  The cable was about 22 feet long (6.7 meters).  I said, ‚ÄúYou will not like what I am saying now.  Do you have a 25 foot (7.6 meter) ethernet cable? ‚Äù  He replied that yes and I asked him to bring the cable.  Connect and it worked.  We have already sent them new routers, costing several hundred thousand dollars and installation, since we were sure that this was our problem.  And it was a cable.  I was very happy to go back home and enjoy the holidays with my family, but even more I was happy to put that guy in his place, because he was harsh on me.  This is a word about the support and services from Cisco.  We are ready for much, we often went to the meeting, supporting the decisions of clients when their network fell.  Often they themselves were to blame for the problems, but we still went to meet our client. <br><br>  Finally, Cisco Capital.  This is a great solution and I support it.  Rent these things.  Rent.  Many of our partners have their own leasing solutions and so on, but Cisco Capital is a thoughtful opportunity.  The great thing about this program is that you don‚Äôt need to have a huge amount of money.  Cisco Capital specialists will come to your client and talk with him and I know some of them.  And by the way, I have a little story on this topic.  Do you know that we rent buses in Texas?  Cisco is renting buses in Texas.  The school system in Texas wanted to use solutions from Cisco, but they had no money for it.  They had funding from the state, but this was not enough.  A specialist from our company came to them and talked with them.  It turned out that they had enough money for the program, but then they would not be able to pay for school buses.  Then we rented these buses.  We are very flexible in our decisions.  We will not lend to an unreliable partner, but we are ready for innovative solutions and leasing is a good opportunity.  Thanks to leasing, you will get more products, 30% more.  You get a client for a cycle of three years.  And given that the cost of technology is reduced, and they pay in the next 3 years, you may even be able to provide additional technology or reduce the price over time.  There are many advantages.  Again, there are a lot of people working in Cisco Capital who can advise on it, I can't afford it.  I cannot control the expenses of my wife from my card.  But the experts of this program are very good.  And I advise you not to look at leasing as a last resort, but to make it part of the business process.  We do not want to cash in on leasing, it will never bring mountains of gold, but it is mutually beneficial.  Benefit for all parties.  You need to understand whether this is required by your business.  I talk about this with customers.  I say: ‚ÄúHey, what do you think about infrastructure leasing‚Äù?  It can be very entertaining conversations.  About what they want and what they can afford.  And how leasing is likely to speed up the production of the products they need. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZqJw2y19YXQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Continued:</b> <br><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/350854/">FastTrack Training.</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/350854/">"Network Basics".</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/350854/">"Basics of data centers."</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/350854/">Part 1.
