I have it in the Outline folder, so there may be inaccuracies / repetitions / contradictions right in the text, because this is a draft. <br><br>  *** <br>  A virtual thing (BB) is a thing that exists only as an image on the Internet.  But, nevertheless, it can be transferred to someone, sold or donated, as well as broken or used for its intended purpose.  For example, consider a weapon in a MMORG of WOW type. Or L2 is a classic virtual thing.  The difference between our explosives and others is their independence from a certain game, gift site, etc.  BB exist as if all over the Internet, the scope of their distribution is not limited.  That is, the owner of the explosives can transfer / sell it to anyone in the internet. <br><br>  At the moment it is not implied that the explosives will give their owners any advantages.  BB is a means to bring aesthetic and / or emotional pleasure to yourself or another person.  For example, by presenting a bouquet of flowers or a ringlet to a girlfriend‚Äôs friend on LJ (see, <a href="http://skazo4ka.livejournal.com/47206.html">for example</a> ).

      Some fragmentary sketches / examples illustrating why explosives are needed are outlined below. <br><br>  In general, the main distribution of explosives are blogs, forums, chat rooms and similar places of virtual communication of people.  Smiles are needed to express emotions.  BB something complement and develop them.  The main difference between explosives is their non-freeness and greater solidity.  BB is sold for money, everyone knows that, and this gives them additional significance.  The difference between a virtual bouquet in the form of a simple picture from an Internet and an BB-bouquet is that it was necessary to pay real money for the BB-bouquet. <br><br>  BB is designed for virtual people.  For those who live on the Internet and do not consider it unnatural.  The introduction of explosives will generate a large wave of disturbance among antivircules.  They will shout that it is stupidity - to spend real money on non-existent things.  But this is only because they are not sufficiently immersed in the virtual.  Illustrations on this topic can be obtained by typing something like ‚Äúvirtual things‚Äù in Yandex and reading the sample results. <br><br>  BB can exist in the form of a static image, a 3D model, or in the form of an animated movie.  By performing some type of ‚ÄúUse‚Äù on BB, the user can observe and hear a certain sequence of actions.  For example, using BB-cola means opening a bottle with it and pouring it into a glass.  At the same time, the corresponding flash movie with an appetizing sound series is played.  After the ‚Äúuse‚Äù, the BB-cola loses its properties and goes into the ‚Äúused‚Äù state.  The second time to pour virtual cola can not. <br><br>  BB can exist in different quantities of copies.  For example, the number of bottles of BB-cola can be measured in millions or even be unlimited.  And at the same time, there may be an exclusive BB-necklace in a single copy.  "Uniqueness" increases the price and value of explosives for its owner. <br><br>  BB has a number of standard states, and standard actions can be applied to BB. <br>  List of states (as a first approximation): <br>  ‚Ä¢ Standard (BB is ‚Äúin full health‚Äù, any actions are allowed to it) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Used (not applicable to all explosives. For example, you can use a pie (ie, eat it), but you can not use a bouquet of flowers) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Broken (broken thing, trampled patty, broken flowers). <br><br>  List of actions (as a first approximation): <br>  ‚Ä¢ View (the state exists as a link. I place this link on my blog and brag about - ‚Äúsee what I have‚Äù, ‚Äúsee what was presented to me‚Äù, etc. Also, any other user can place this link wherever he wants. She does not give him any rights.) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Transfer (presumably through a special interface, with the possibility of a secure transaction, including sales) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Use (not available for the whole BB. For example, a bouquet cannot be used.) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Break (available for all explosives. Necessary action because this can express your attitude to another person, for example, by breaking his gift.) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Throw away (permissible for all explosives. After the explosives are thrown out, they either disappear or end up in an explosive landfill that everyone has access to. All explosives that have been thrown out can exist for a certain amount of time at the landfill, if they are not taken away, they disappear. And become the property of the one who picked them up.) <br><br>  We need to think about such a thing as packaging for explosives.  First of all, it is gift wrapping - a gift box type in which a gift can be sent to another person.  In fact, the packaging is also BB, disposable (???), which disappears after use (???).  In short, there are still many questions.  Perhaps this is just another state of explosives - "Packed", with the ability to choose the type of packaging.  (An impromptu strange example - pick up a used can of cola at a dump, pack nicely and send a goat for a birthday :)) <br><br>  The life of all explosives begins with the fact that they are created.  For a start, we do it.  Then we make it possible for anyone who wants to create explosives and give / transfer / sell it through our website.  It is important to comply with the quality criteria.  All explosives must be presentable, you can not drop the brand.  Therefore, all explosives are not our development will be moderated.  One of the attributes of explosives is the author.  Because the copyright question will arise sooner or later. <br><br>  Then you can buy explosives in our store.  The purchase process is recorded in the history of explosives.  (In general, as a retreat, I must say that every explosive is accompanied by history throughout its life - all actions on explosives are recorded and subsequent owners can view it. This is done for different purposes, including to trace the fate of unique explosives , get confirmation of their authenticity, belonging to certain characters in their time, etc.). <br>  When buying, the buyer indicates his nickname and it is recorded in the history of explosives. <br><br>  The purchase process consists in the receipt by the buyer of a link to the administration of BB  Follow the link (well, of course there are passwords and all that), he gets the opportunity to perform with BB any actions available for this type of explosives.  At the same time, a ‚ÄúView‚Äù link, which he can post on the Internet and transfer to an unlimited number of people, will simply display the current state of the explosive ‚Äî a new beautiful, used, broken, etc.  IMPORTANT: the link contains not only the code of explosives but also the code of the owner.  As soon as I gave my explosives to someone, then the link, which I published earlier, this explosives will not load, and the message will be loaded like ‚ÄúTransferred to another owner‚Äù, or ‚ÄúBrokeback‚Äù, or ‚ÄúDoes not exist‚Äù, etc. .  At the same time (apparently) there will be an opportunity to somehow give a request only by the BB code, without the owner - in order to trace its history - for example, I wondered what the one whom I gave it with my last year‚Äôs gift is interesting.  But so far it is not completely clear whether to do it or not. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  Everything, here I finish, the review of small and so far unimportant details further begins. <br>  What do you think, will they buy a virtual stake of 10 cents?  A bouquet of virtual flowers for a couple of bucks?  Necklace for a hundred? <br>  Will it become popular to give explosives? <br>  Well, in general, I am interested in your opinion. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149/</a></p>
