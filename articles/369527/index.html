  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Common in cosmological and gravitational reddening of photons</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I propose to think about the cosmological and gravitational reddening of photons.  Is there something in common between these phenomena that is already reflected in their name?  Let them have long been studied, and they have different reasons, but we will try to look at them in a new way, differently than described in the textbooks.  Indeed, the expansion of space and gravity are not yet fully understood phenomena.  Therefore, we have the right to step away from the course leading to problems with cosmological constant and quantum gravity. <br><br>  We can move away from the existing theories, but not from the facts.  The basis for our judgments is the fact of redshift in the spectra of distant galaxies.  The farther the galaxy is from us, the greater this shift.  It‚Äôs as if they all fly away from us beyond the event horizon that surrounds our Hubble volume - the part of the universe that we see. <br><br>  In fact, all clusters of galaxies are scattered from each other due to the expansion of an energetically dense vacuum between them.  But for an observer in any galaxy, all other clusters of galaxies scatter from him, from his measuring instruments, which record the redshift of different magnitudes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It is also clear that the redshift does not indicate the galaxy's own speed in the vacuum surrounding it, but the rate of removal of this vacuum from us, together with the galaxy contained in it.  Indeed, on a cosmological scale, the vacuum expands, and with respect to us its remote areas move from us - the faster, the farther they are from us and closer to the event horizon.  Therefore, beyond the radius of the event horizon, the speed of vacuum removal, together with all its contents, exceeds the light speed.  What is not allowed to matter, according to GTR, is allowed to the space environment - the vacuum.

      And then an interesting moment arises.  If the medium, expanding, moves away from us, then its movement should affect the speed and frequency of the photons flying towards it - electromagnetic waves emitted by galaxies.  How does this affect, for example, the frequency and speed of sound waves propagating in a counter-flow of water.  The counter flow of the carrier waves reduces their speed and frequency for a stationary observer. <br><br>  Please do not confuse - I'm not talking about the violation of the constancy of the speed of light.  The light in the surrounding vacuum flies at its normal speed, regardless of its own speed of its source.  But it is the independence of the speed of light from the speed of its source that indicates its dependence on the speed and direction of movement of the carrier of light ‚Äî the vacuum.  The expanding vacuum takes away from us not only galaxies, but also their light, which ultimately creates an event horizon. <br><br>  Therefore, it should be assumed that cosmological reddening of photons is an increase in the length of electromagnetic waves caused by their deceleration by a counter flow of a vacuum expanding from the observer.  This is a natural consequence of the existing cause, which cannot be ignored. <br><br>  Then how to understand the gravitational reddening of photons?  It should also be explained in the same way.  For example, an observer in orbit near a massive body records an increase in the length of electromagnetic waves coming to him from this body.  But the body is not removed from the observer along with the surrounding vacuum.  This means that only the vacuum itself moves away from the observer to the body, and its movement, which is counter to the recorded electromagnetic waves, slows down and lengthens them. <br><br>  It turns out that the matter of bodies constantly absorbs the vacuum, dilutes it around itself, and this causes a constant influx of external, denser vacuum to it.  This is manifested as gravity - the movement of the vacuum to the body and its stretching at the same time.  About where the vacuum goes in matter, I wrote here: <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/277698/">geektimes.ru/post/277698</a> <br><br>  Then the formation of the event horizon around black holes occurs for a similar reason: the speed of the vacuum from the Schwarzschild sphere to the central singularity exceeds the speed of light.  And the effect of entrainment of space by a rotating body also receives an almost visual explanation.  Vacuum, absorbed, for example, by the Sun, is twisted in the plane of its equator like water in a funnel, and this causes the known rotation of the elliptical orbit of Mercury. <br><br>  Is there logic in such reasoning?  If logical errors were made, where exactly?  What physical facts forbid reasoning in this way? <br><br>  Apparently, there is logic, because on its basis an international group of scientists 8 years ago created a black hole simulation in the hydrodynamic laboratory: <a href="http://www.membrana.ru/particle/12544">www.membrana.ru/particle/12544</a> .  Gravity in it was modeled by the accelerating flow of water to the waterfall - to the "central singularity" (as can be seen in the figure).  And the transverse waves on the water, running towards the stream, were divided by the ‚Äúevent horizon‚Äù.  In front of him, waves that had greater speed than the oncoming flow moved away from the ‚Äúblack hole‚Äù, and behind it the waves were carried away by an ever faster flow to its ‚Äúcenter‚Äù. <br><br>  From such an understanding of gravity, one can move to the creation of its full-fledged theory.  And - to the theory of quantum gravity, since the vacuum is absorbed by particles of matter in quanta.  But the energetically dense quantized vacuum is actually an ether, only consisting of mutually compressed ethers.  And to accomplish such a revolution in physics, a revolutionary situation is needed.  Apparently, it has not yet matured, therefore it is more advantageous not to notice the total in cosmological and gravitational reddening of photons. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369527/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369527/</a></p>
