      From the translator: You can read the original article <a href="https://www.groovehq.com/support/customer-service-phrases">here</a> .  The list of previously translated materials is available at the end of the post.  Happy reading, Team Service for <a href="http://teamdesk.ru/">Teamdesk</a> customer <a href="http://teamdesk.ru/">support</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Like, speaking the right words, serving customers is even better. </h1><br>  Much more can depend on the wording than we imagine.  In fact, choosing the right word can play a huge role when it comes to the behavior or feelings of a person. <br><br>  Last year, Facebook changed <b>“Hide / Mark as spam”</b> to <b>“I don’t want to see this”</b> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a9/663/ffe/1a9663ffe38243b1b6ba2c9f0cfaa74b.png"><br><br>  What is the result? <br>  <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/16/facebook-compassion_n_4441716.html">58% increase in the</a> number of people who are active in their news feed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d98/c6f/ca3/d98c6fca31be4cf4ba57602727028690.png"><br>  Just from changing a few words! <br><br>  The same principle can be applied to customer service: the use of correct key phrases during communication can affect a customer’s negative experience and give it a feeling of satisfaction.  Below you can find a list of six phrases that will help you improve support and build deep customer relationships. <br><br><h2>  Phrase # 1.  “I don't know, but I’ll figure it out for you.” </h2><br>  A few years ago I moved from San Francisco and I had to disconnect from the cable Internet. <br>  It should be noted that this year this company was recognized as “The <a href="http://consumerist.com/2014/04/08/congratulations-to-comcast-your-2014-worst-company-in-america/">worst company in America</a> ” ... and this was the second time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3f4/49a/69d/3f449a69d08145e0b736db4ec4ae46bd.jpg"><br><br>  I called the provider and told me that I would like to disconnect. <br><br>  <b>Answer</b> : <i>“Call Accounting.”</i> <br>  <b>I</b> : <i>“Good.</i>  <i>Can you transfer me to Accounting? ”</i> <br>  <b>Answer</b> : <i>“We cannot do this.</i>  <i>Here is their number. ”</i> <br><br>  Already feeling caring, I dialed the Accounting number ... <br><br>  <b>Their answer</b> : <i>“I see, call this number here ...”</i> <br><br>  I spent another 45 minutes during the day to reach at least someone who could help me, until I wrote about my problem on Twitter. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d4e/e91/f63/d4ee91f638114c66985dd703816321a0.png"><br>  The only reason I still used this provider was because I had no choice. <br>  But for most of us, our customers have a choice, and it would be foolish to treat customers that way. <br>  In <a href="http://about.americanexpress.com/news/pr/2011/csbar.aspx">2011, a survey was conducted among customers</a> , American Express asked respondents about which service phrase was the most annoying for them. <br><br>  And the winner!? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/901/141/81e/90114181e83842a1bdc55e64a45a6327.png"><br>  Good service is not in knowing the answers to all customer questions.  Often, for good service it is enough to spare the client from finding an answer for himself.  Do it for him. <br><br><h2>  Phrase # 2.  “I would also be disappointed.” </h2><br>  There is a <a href="http://jsr.sagepub.com/content/15/3/316.abstract">lot of research</a> on the importance of empathy in customer service, but Seth Godin revealed the best topic in <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2012/09/the-simplest-service-question-of-all.html">this short message</a> : <br><br>  <i>The easiest customer service question of all:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>“Why is it not so important for you as it is for me?”</i> <br><br>  Each of us faced this situation, and no matter at what point it happened.  It could be a difficult conversation with a friend or family member: you do not know what your interlocutor feels and you may not understand why he behaves just that way.  And even more so you can not affect it.  But you can show your empathy and thereby make it empathizing with you. <br>  That is why it is so important not only to empathize, but also to try to convey this to your client. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d4a/5e1/93b/d4a5e193b0d142138b2b9839a3092639.png"><br><h2>  Phrase # 3.  “I would be happy to help you!” </h2><br>  Researchers Andrew Nyuberg and Mark Robert Voldman, in their book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Words-Can-Change-Your-Brain/dp/1594630909/">Words can change your brain</a> , have found that using positive words can drastically change how we perceive reality. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91a/2df/e1b/91a2dfe1bf7f419ba8c00b973cf0cd59.png"><br>  <i>With positive words, you can make your clients (and you) feel more positive.</i> <br><br>  In a world where <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/RightNow/2010-customer-experience-impact">95% of customers</a> have already made their choice (for example, they refused services or complained about it to others) because they got a negative experience, the simplest tactic would be to use positive words in customer service, and this can give good results. <br>  Therefore, when contacting a client with a problem by email, instead of answering <i>“I will do it for you”</i> , tell him that you will be <i>happy to</i> help him. <br><br><h2>  Phrase # 4.  “I will keep you informed every [Day or Hour].” </h2><br>  If the client sends a letter with the title “Verification”, then we consider that this is our problem. <br>  During the testing of this phrase, we found out that the clients of which we keep up to date, 10% more likely answer us to various questions via email than those we keep in the dark. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/78c/5ec/ca1/78c5ecca146b4f4083d4d53ddb39d204.png"><br>  Two things that protect us from such appeals: <br><ol><li>  Make sure that you keep the client up to date with the progress of processing his requests as often as possible (at least once a day). </li><li>  <b>Let the client know when he will be able to hear from you.</b> </li></ol><br>  Although you may not know exactly when you will process his appeal, you can promise him to keep him informed regularly.  This is not just a promise to keep him informed, it is an opportunity to build a more trusting relationship. <br><br><h2>  Phrase # 5.  “Your message is very valuable to us.” </h2><br>  <a href="http://leeresources.com/">According to the survey</a> , only <b>1 out of 26 clients</b> complains.  So  you simply will not hear those 26 clients who are experiencing difficulties. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/841/fb3/319/841fb331959c4098a5d6af9d2e88d7cf.png"><br>  <i>Each complaint may mean that there are dozens of other customers who are just silent.</i> <br><br>  This means that solving the problem of one who applied can make happy dozens of other customers. <br>  This is a <i>huge</i> opportunity.  And this is a serious <i>gift</i> from a client who decided to inform you about it. <br>  In the famous book by Dale Carnegie, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034">How to Win Friends and Influence People</a> , one of the basic principles of being generous with appreciation. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2fb/324/f51/2fb324f519974129a91393812747d33d.png"><br>  <i>“In our interpersonal relationships, we should never forget that all our partners are people and want appreciation.</i>  <i>This is a legal tender that can please the soul. ”</i> <br><br>  To build good relationships with your customers (and not only), never forget to thank them. <br><br><h2>  Phrase # 6.  “Can I help you with anything else?” </h2><br>  Despite our best intentions and efforts, we cannot always be right. <br>  In fact, <a href="http://liveworkstudio.com/perspectives/service-in-retail/">one study says</a> that while 94% of online stores provide email support, the <i>answers to 27% of these calls will not be satisfactory</i> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ad/6e2/ad2/9ad6e2ad29fc4a39805c74a9dc5c58b3.png"><br>  I suspect that most of those who read this article on average are much better able to cope with this situation.  But the fact remains that there are cases when our answers are not complete and are not able to help the client.  The problem is that most people do not want to talk about problems.  So if your answers were not completely helpful to the client, he will ask you to clarify the situation or contact you later. <br>  This is what this <b>most common phrase</b> in the field of customer service deals with.  You leave the “door open” and give the client to understand that he can speak if he has unresolved issues. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  The introduction of these keywords and phrases in the process of customer service will give instant results and it will not take much time, because in the end you will get even more happy and loyal customers. <br><br>  <b>List of previously translated materials</b> : <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/260549/">4 scripts to handle the most complex Email from clients</a> . </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/262627/">https://habr.com/ru/post/262627/</a></p>
