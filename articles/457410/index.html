  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Acronis Foundation: schools have already been built in 8 countries. Are you with us?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Acronis Foundation International Foundation helps to spread knowledge around the world, and one of the key areas of volunteer work is building and supporting schools.  About how this is happening today, and what contribution each of us can make to this process, read under the cut. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zj/yw/pr/zjywpr1_-yrcxq_gez_ti5dykao.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Sooner or later, many successful organizations come to a new stage of social growth ‚Äî they are starting to organize charitable activities.  And everyone has their own way to implement.  In particular, in 2018 Acronis established the international charitable foundation <a href="https://acronis.org/">Acronis Foundation</a> , which is engaged in the enhancement of knowledge around the world.  We are sure that it is knowledge that helps people achieve their goals and, to realize themselves, and society, by having knowledge, increases the standard of living. <br><br>  Among the projects that we are developing, there are areas such as the construction of schools and the organization of infrastructure for teaching children, the development of educational programs and the publication of educational books.  Also in Singapore, where the judicial system is very harsh, and many prisoners are serving sentences for minor crimes by European standards, we help the released to gain new knowledge, to master the modern profession and to adapt to the modern digital world.  In addition, there is a development of training programs for children of prisoners, who should not lose their opportunities due to misconduct of their parents.  The Acronis Foundation publishes books for children, where we tell in simple language about scientific discoveries, modern technologies, and car sports.  A new book on quantum computing is being prepared to help the younger generation to get acquainted with the latest trends in an exciting history format.

      The other day, with the support of the Acronis Foundation, a school in Nuevo Chimbote (Peru) was built and opened.  This is a region where the level of education is one of the lowest in the country.  The school was built in partnership with the Italian charity organization Don Bosco 3A, and the Instituci√≥n Educativa Virgen de las Gracias school will provide free education, training materials, uniforms and meals for about 230 children from the most needy families of the local community in the coming school year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sa/4k/ex/sa4kexhyrzf7xn0hsznm-btvmpc.jpeg"><br>  <i>School in Peru</i> <br><br><h4>  More education opportunities in different countries </h4><br>  Acronis is an international company with headquarters in Singapore and Switzerland.  The organization has 27 offices located in 18 countries, including the USA, Bulgaria, Germany, France, Great Britain, Belgium, Russia, Japan, etc., and the company's products are used in more than 170 countries.  The Acronis Foundation also works across the globe and helps children in different regions, because according <a href="http://madan.org.il/ru/news/bolee-poloviny-detey-i-podrostkov-v-mire-ne-poluchayut-obrazovanie">to UNESCO,</a> more than 387 million children of primary school age (56%) and 230 million adolescents at the age of junior high school (61%) will not reach the minimum level of ownership reading skills and mathematics.  We strive to make education more accessible to children around the world, given the differences in the needs of different countries. <br><br>  In Russia, there is a compulsory secondary education, and children are taught basic disciplines in every corner of the country, and educational organizations offer correspondence programs for supplementary education in a variety of subjects for children, we help develop in-depth education.  For example, last year in Ulyanovsk and Novorossiysk, with the support of the Acronis Foundation, two additional education centers were opened together with the Unium franchise, where children can immerse themselves in natural science and humanities. <br><br>  Other regions require different approaches, since in a number of countries a significant number of children do not have the opportunity to attend school at all.  And since we are confident that the situation with the level of knowledge throughout the world directly affects our quality of life, the global economy, the level of awareness of environmental policy, the fight against crime, and so on.  To this end, we have been helping to build schools in the regions with the lowest level of education penetration for several years.  You can agree or disagree with this position, but we are always happy to see the support of this project from the IT community, which, like no one else, understands the value of the overall literacy level among specialists. <br><br><h4>  Build a building.  To organize the infrastructure.  Prepare teachers. </h4><br>  Although in Russia and Europe education is accessible to everyone, in the modern world, there are not so many places in the world where children not only have nobody to learn from, but also no place to learn.  The total lack of schools is a common practice in many African and Asian regions, and the Acronis Foundation is working to help these guys get their chance to show their intellectual potential and create their contribution to the development of society. <br><br>  To build the school building itself, it is necessary to attract partners, find a regional construction specialist, and enlist the support of the government and the municipality.  We built 6 schools - in Myanmar, Tanzania, Cambodia, Senegal, Lebanon and Peru.  For example, in Senegal, volunteers managed to take a direct part in construction - 20 Acronis employees from different countries spent several weeks in the village, building the school - laying the foundation, casting concrete blocks, assembling metal frames and other tasks at all stages of construction.  We have already talked about this in more detail in a <a href="https://bigpikcha.ru/%3Fp%3D1110179">separate article on BigPikcha</a> .  Two schools are now at the stage of completion - in Guatemala and Laos.  But we do not dwell on this, and agreements have already been reached on the construction of another school, and other regions are constantly being considered with a lack of access to education. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3d/ql/3y/3dql3y3hqu9kykvt_gtbsjcjlqy.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hn/j6/tv/hnj6tv7yysfa-yuem-i0veq2zfe.jpeg"><br>  <i>School in Lebanon</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dj/gh/0y/djgh0yhrp78v0t59nv3duxtle9k.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-y/7a/yp/-y7aypeg5uzajg7rlcucwic89zg.jpeg"><br>  <i>School in Senegal</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8j/xu/jr/8jxujrpspqtxqc19_dx6ywngvsq.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ut/cm/fn/utcmfnmudk0wua7epurzovrkbdy.jpeg"><br>  <i>Construction in Guatemala</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lz/4l/wi/lz4lwitaxd1_f2qx5no4zuqsf9k.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rx/kr/-h/rxkr-hrj6uuxjpms9eu4zrnhycm.jpeg"><br>  <i>Myanmar School</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rh/y8/x9/rhy8x9sc2qqc9ktahgnlmbj5sec.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uj/0v/cc/uj0vcc-rupbtfimyabvm1ribrqo.jpeg"><br>  <i>School in Cambodia</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ef/7d/yh/ef7dyh5rhl-u4x8pxsauzje4xbi.jpeg"><br>  <i>Training class in Laos</i> <br><br>  Funds for the construction of schools are allocated by the Acronis Foundation charity foundation, as well as its partners - companies and corporations from different countries.  The funds received by the Acronis Foundation accounts are 100% spent only on foundation projects.  For example, volunteers from the company are going to help with construction only at the expense of Acronis, which also takes over the payment of tickets, all legal and accounting costs.  The same applies to book printing and curriculum development - funding for these projects is allocated separately, since the Acronis Foundation's finances are exclusively targeted. <br><br>  In a number of countries we cooperate with already existing educational institutions.  For example, in Bhutan, active processes are currently under way to improve the education system, and we have invited three specialists to Singapore to learn from the experience and explore the Singaporean education system.  We see support for education at the level of the country's ministry of education, and our foundation also seeks cooperation.  Although we did not build new schools in Bhutan, we can help existing conditions with the organization.  For example, some schools in the region are in dire need of building sanitary facilities, organizing water supply, and installing solar panels. <br><br><h4>  Studying proccess </h4><br>  Our task is not just to build a building, but to create a sustainable project, in which regional funds, the government and society are also interested, so that it continues its development as an independent unit.  Therefore, working on each school, we do not just run the construction.  Volunteers come to personally get acquainted with the living conditions of children, see what they lack for effective study and formulate further stages of support for each school. <br><br>  Everywhere has its own nuances, for example, the newly built school in Senegal is in dire need of office supplies.  In addition, the school lacks teachers, as a result, teachers come to children from Dakar, the capital of the state.  Some schools are built closer to cities, and there it‚Äôs easier with teachers, but the level of poverty in some African, Asian and Latin American countries is very different from region to region.  Some children are familiar with computers, others have no electricity, third have nothing to wear and nothing to write on ... well, there is nothing to write about either. <br><br>  For example, when Graham Hackland, the IT director of the <a href="https://www.williamsf1.com/">Williams Racing Team</a> , came with us to the construction site, he brought with him branded notebooks, which we distributed to all students of the new school.  Other partners help with stationery - pens and pencils, which children simply do not have.  The Arsenal football club has transferred its club T-shirts and balls to Senegal, Lebanon and Cambodia, and now the children can play football and take part in competitions in their football uniforms - like a real professional team.  Many schools need small solar generators and laptops, which we agree to supply today. <br><br>  Intensive work with schools that we have already opened, brings its results.  And, for example, one of the first schools opened in Myanmar 5 months after our departure moved to a new level of work.  The guys go there basic courses of work with computers, although before they did not have access to modern technology.  Also, a good level of digitalization was achieved in Cambodia, where teachers themselves use computers to upgrade their skills and download new teaching materials. <br><br>  In Tanzania and Senegal, things are much more complicated, as the infrastructure and society itself is further from the modern ‚Äúdigital‚Äù era.  There you have to go through a whole series of steps so that the guys can use the computer, like their peers from other states. <br><br><h4>  Educational program </h4><br>  But the most interesting thing is that the mere presence of a school with infrastructure and teachers does not always reveal the full potential of knowledge for children.  We specifically develop a computer literacy course that will help children who have never seen a mobile phone before, explain why we need the Internet, how to use it. <br><br>  Today we are working on a teacher training program that is planned to be launched along with friendly Acronis universities.  Educational institutions have a sufficient base for organizing the retraining of teachers in full-time and part-time.  We also want to involve staff and university students in the development of special educational programs for children living in areas with a lack of access to knowledge. <br><br>  Our goal is to make clear the scope of the opportunities that digital learning offers.  Help children see global growth potential based on online programs.  And everyone can work on this course.  If you have read this post to the end, you probably have ideas on how best to teach computer skills or other important subjects to children from Africa and Asia.  And we will be happy to see you among the co-authors or reviewers of the new courses, which have to be specially adapted to each individual country.
