  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Corporate selection.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It has been a long time ago; somehow, from the six department heads, our bosses needed to choose the most powerful, active and prepared person for the position of general manager. <a name="habracut"></a>  Since I got this position? The question of choosing was open for quite a long time, of course, for all this time, all six were doing their best, trying to put themselves in the best light.  The new position would require much more from a person than they were doing in the six, the general manager would have to monitor the progress of all projects, the fulfillment of all tasks on time and much more that was not mentioned in the instructions.  Ie in fact he would have to be the boss for the rest.  On his shoulders falls responsibility for everything, not only for the work, but also for the task, its working capacity, in general, this person would have to control absolutely everything, and this requires no small effort. <br>  Bosses from time to time created not standard situations for these people to look at their reaction and the reaction of each in particular.  In general, one evening our bosses said that the next day would be the last test and asked not to be late for the robot.  You do not think that they are monsters, they just really care that everything is in order and they really need the best in this position.  10 minutes after arriving at the robot, we were asked to go outside to the entrance to the building, which we did.  There they were already waiting for us and the bus, they all sat down and went somewhere.  As it turned out, they brought us to a paintball club.  They told me to prepare for the game ... We were a little embarrassed, but also excited, since none of us had played paintball before, in fact, everyone was very interested.  After we put on all the ammunition we were given trunks, the instructor later explained that the ‚Äútrunk‚Äù was called a marker.  After the briefing, they launched us "in the field."  What is a field?  - Inflatable figures, placed on the territory, they were in the paint apparently before us there was already a battle.  Immediately after us, 5 people entered the field, the guys were in the same shape, the markers were prettier, and behind the backs there were some pieces with additional balls.  We greeted and parted on different sides of the field.  If I were evaluating our game now, then clearly we would have no chance, these guys were professional paintball players, the team played, all with electronics, and with tubs with balls.  But then we still did not know all this.  Let's go back to the field.  The judge checked that everything was normal and blew his whistle.  What happened next cannot be described in words ... The hail of balls fell on us, there were thousands of them, as it seemed to me then, although the rest were not far from this thought ... In general, in less than 30 seconds everything ended.  We were all "killed."  After a little consultation after the field, we came up with at least some kind of strategy.  In general, it has come down to the fact that we hid and waited until they came, but the result is zero.  We were knocked out one by one, although the duration of the round was more than 30 seconds.  And so it went on five times.  Then I analyzed how much my brain could do at that moment, the actions of the enemy and began to ‚Äúdirect‚Äù my work colleagues, saying where they should run, when to shoot.  That day I broke my throat, but what I got as a result was more important, about that later.  Under my command, we "killed" several enemy players for the round, although we lost as a result, but we had very little chance of winning.  Once even "took" the round.  And so the day passed, we were about to go home, tired, all in paint and bruises, but each of us got great pleasure from the game.  We were approached by bosses who were watching us all the time, we plunged into the bus and drove home.  The next day, I was a little late for work, my voice was just as hoarse, a couple of our employees congratulated me on something, but for some reason I did not understand what.  When I approached my workplace, one of the chiefs called me and asked what I was doing.  After he showed me my new workplace.  So thanks to paintball, I got my promotion.  By the way, I play paintball to this day :) <br><br>  I have long heard that companies practice paintball to identify more powerful employees who can command others.  What do you think about this practice or could someone participate in such a selection?  :) <br><br>  Taken <a href="http://paintballwars.ru/%3FL%3Dblogs.blog%26article%3D36">here</a> . </div>
