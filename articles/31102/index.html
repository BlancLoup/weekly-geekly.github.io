On May 30, conference organizers Cara Swisher and Walt Mossberg conducted a historic interview in which top executives from Microsoft and Apple - Bill Gates and Steve Jobs - participated. <br>  This is the third part of the interview, the <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/translations/16955.html">first part is read here</a> , the <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/translations/16957.html">second is here</a> , a video of the interview can be viewed <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D_5Z7eal4uXI%26mode%3Drelated%26search%3D">here</a> . <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/45c/f70/76f/45cf7076f99e50fd4a0a8bada708143b.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Kara swisher" hspace="10">  We talked about the radical changes that await your companies. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/0a5/6d7/a61/0a56d7a618989cb1576b45356f8dfc9a.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Walt mossberg" hspace="10">  But we still have the key interface elements are the mouse and icons.  You talked about how big a bet it was made in 1984, and how Windows followed.  We still follow this approach.  I would like to know if he will change. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/397/4b9/c41/3974b9c41684403dcea98015c424664f.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Bill gates" hspace="10">  Touches, ink, speech, sight, all this comes, but they are not a radical substitute.  I think that you underestimate the degree of evolution that occurred.  You just lived with it year after year.  If we transported you ten years ago, then when you returned, you would say: ‚ÄúWow, a new ideology has appeared - this is a search and tags‚Äù.  Evolution is a very good thing.  In fact, even in the evolutionary process, for example, when we made changes to Office, we were constantly breaking the balance.  Specifically, in this case, I'm talking about the "Ribbon" (Ribbon).  You always encounter users who say, ‚ÄúDamn it, all the time I have to spend time mastering all these new products.‚Äù  So there was a very fruitful evolution.  But all these things related to the natural interface are revolutionary and will revolutionize the interface further.  That's what, along with the three-dimensionality, I talked about. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/45c/f70/76f/45cf7076f99e50fd4a0a8bada708143b.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Kara swisher" hspace="10">  Steve?  I know you are working on something excellent, and we will soon have to see it. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/0a5/6d7/a61/0a56d7a618989cb1576b45356f8dfc9a.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Walt mossberg" hspace="10">  And you can not tell about it. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/cc9/3c3/3fe/cc93c33fe6f9e61eb093cbc87501feb8.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Steve jobs" hspace="10">  For sure. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/0a5/6d7/a61/0a56d7a618989cb1576b45356f8dfc9a.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Walt mossberg" hspace="10">  Bill laid out all his secrets to us.  You do not tell anything. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/cc9/3c3/3fe/cc93c33fe6f9e61eb093cbc87501feb8.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Steve jobs" hspace="10">  I know it's not fair.  In fact, I think this is a very simple question.  It is about how many truly revolutionary things in the next five years will be made on the PC, and which on the post-PC devices.  There is a genuine temptation to focus on post-PC devices, because they are a clean board, and because these devices are more focused, and because they have no legacy of myriad applications running on myriad markets. <br>  Therefore, I think that we are waiting for a colossal revolution related to post-PC devices.  The question is how much will be done with the PCs themselves.  And I‚Äôm sure that Microsoft, like us, is working on really amazing things.  But we have to hold on to horses a bit, because we have tens of millions - in our case, and hundreds of millions - of Bill, users who are already used to certain things.  They do not need a car with six wheels.  They like a car with four wheels.  They do not want to steer with the handle, they like the steering wheel. <br>  Therefore, as Bill has already said, in some cases you have to upgrade already existing things, and in other cases you can make fundamental changes.  I think a radical rethinking will happen in the world of post-PC devices. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/45c/f70/76f/45cf7076f99e50fd4a0a8bada708143b.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Kara swisher" hspace="10">  I will ask a more personal question.  Literally in a minute we will allow the audience to ask questions.  What was greatest - I will not remember the famous moment with Barbara Walters and ask what tree you would like to be, but ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/0a5/6d7/a61/0a56d7a618989cb1576b45356f8dfc9a.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Walt mossberg" hspace="10">  Let me say that she would like to be Barbara Walters. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/45c/f70/76f/45cf7076f99e50fd4a0a8bada708143b.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Kara swisher" hspace="10">  No, I would not want to.  What was the biggest misunderstanding ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/cc9/3c3/3fe/cc93c33fe6f9e61eb093cbc87501feb8.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Steve jobs" hspace="10">  Call <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/45c/f70/76f/45cf7076f99e50fd4a0a8bada708143b.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Kara swisher" hspace="10">  The call, right.  Thanks Steve.  I want to say that your relationship goes down in history.  What was the biggest misunderstanding in your relationship?  What could you recall now from a multitude of events? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/cc9/3c3/3fe/cc93c33fe6f9e61eb093cbc87501feb8.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Steve jobs" hspace="10">  We have kept our wedding a secret for more than ten years now. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/45c/f70/76f/45cf7076f99e50fd4a0a8bada708143b.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Kara swisher" hspace="10">  Canada.

And I know that projects such as the Mack project were simply amazingly interesting, and we had to take risks.  In that video, we look much younger. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/cc9/3c3/3fe/cc93c33fe6f9e61eb093cbc87501feb8.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Steve jobs" hspace="10">  For sure. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/45c/f70/76f/45cf7076f99e50fd4a0a8bada708143b.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Kara swisher" hspace="10">  At first you look 12 years old. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/397/4b9/c41/3974b9c41684403dcea98015c424664f.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Bill gates" hspace="10">  So I try to look now. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/cc9/3c3/3fe/cc93c33fe6f9e61eb093cbc87501feb8.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Steve jobs" hspace="10">  He was twelve. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/397/4b9/c41/3974b9c41684403dcea98015c424664f.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Bill gates" hspace="10">  I enjoyed working together.  I really miss some of those people.  You know, in our industry, people come and go.  It is wonderful when there is someone who was from the very beginning and is in the context of everything that happened.  The industry is going crazy about something new, you know that a successful company must move all the time and all that.  It is very great when there are people who have already experienced many such waves, and yet, when it's worth it, they find the strength to take risks and bring in something new. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/0a5/6d7/a61/0a56d7a618989cb1576b45356f8dfc9a.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Walt mossberg" hspace="10">  One last question, and we will give the microphone to the audience. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/45c/f70/76f/45cf7076f99e50fd4a0a8bada708143b.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Kara swisher" hspace="10">  No, he has not answered us yet ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/0a5/6d7/a61/0a56d7a618989cb1576b45356f8dfc9a.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Walt mossberg" hspace="10">  I apologize? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/cc9/3c3/3fe/cc93c33fe6f9e61eb093cbc87501feb8.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Steve jobs" hspace="10">  I have not answered yet. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/0a5/6d7/a61/0a56d7a618989cb1576b45356f8dfc9a.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Walt mossberg" hspace="10">  Oh, excuse me. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/45c/f70/76f/45cf7076f99e50fd4a0a8bada708143b.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Kara swisher" hspace="10">  He only talked about his secret wedding, so ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/0a5/6d7/a61/0a56d7a618989cb1576b45356f8dfc9a.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Walt mossberg" hspace="10">  Ah, I thought that was the answer. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/cc9/3c3/3fe/cc93c33fe6f9e61eb093cbc87501feb8.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Steve jobs" hspace="10">  No, that was not my answer.  You know, when Bill and I first met and worked together on those old days, we were both the youngest guys in the room.  Each one by one or together.  I'm about six months older, but, in general, we are the same age.  And now, when we work in our respected companies, I don‚Äôt know how about you, but I am usually the oldest of all in the same room.  That's why I'm happy to be here. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/0a5/6d7/a61/0a56d7a618989cb1576b45356f8dfc9a.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Walt mossberg" hspace="10">  Glad to bring you this happiness.

I think that here we should put an end to you.  Let's stop. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/45c/f70/76f/45cf7076f99e50fd4a0a8bada708143b.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Kara swisher" hspace="10">  Oh, I shed a tear right now. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/0a5/6d7/a61/0a56d7a618989cb1576b45356f8dfc9a.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Walt mossberg" hspace="10">  Thank. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/45c/f70/76f/45cf7076f99e50fd4a0a8bada708143b.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Kara swisher" hspace="10">  Thank you very much. <br>  [Applause] <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/45c/f70/76f/45cf7076f99e50fd4a0a8bada708143b.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Kara swisher" hspace="10">  Wow.  Good.  Now questions from the audience, please <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/0a5/6d7/a61/0a56d7a618989cb1576b45356f8dfc9a.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Walt mossberg" hspace="10">  Questions  Can I have more light?  Roger. <br>  <strong>Roger</strong> : Roger McNami of Elevation Partners.  Guys, that was awesome.  Thank you very much.  We will have big elections next year.  I would like to know if there are any issues that are visible to you from your Silicon Valley, about which we should concentrate and effectively interact with the next president of the United States.  That is, some common platform that we all share.  Because, oddly enough, as if you have not heard some things that are now being said everywhere, and I wonder what you think about all this. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/0a5/6d7/a61/0a56d7a618989cb1576b45356f8dfc9a.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Walt mossberg" hspace="10">  Bill? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/397/4b9/c41/3974b9c41684403dcea98015c424664f.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Bill gates" hspace="10">  Well, I, of course, would put the first number on this list education. <br>  <strong>Roger</strong> : Are there any technological solutions that could do something in this area, or ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/397/4b9/c41/3974b9c41684403dcea98015c424664f.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Bill gates" hspace="10">  Not.  The technology is providing more and more assistance, but the ways to evaluate teachers, their improvement, the structure of schools, their expectations, all this does not boil down to bare technology.  It is rather a question of what can be changed in the very structure of these institutions.  There should be a broad discussion of the various paths in education. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/0a5/6d7/a61/0a56d7a618989cb1576b45356f8dfc9a.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Walt mossberg" hspace="10">  Steve? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/cc9/3c3/3fe/cc93c33fe6f9e61eb093cbc87501feb8.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Steve jobs" hspace="10">  Guys, we have quite big problems, and I believe that most of them are too serious for Silicon Valley to solve them.  Hope some of them will be allowed.  I think we underestimate how much our industry depends on stability.  We are experiencing a very long period of stability, and therefore we could focus on our technologies and grow our businesses, and we took it for granted. <br>  One of the most interesting areas is our energy dependence.  And there can be done a lot.  I know about a lot of investments in this area.  I don‚Äôt know if there are already results, but there are big investments in alternative forms of energy and, perhaps, Silicon Valley will play its modest role here. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/45c/f70/76f/45cf7076f99e50fd4a0a8bada708143b.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Kara swisher" hspace="10">  Are you investing in this area in person or ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/397/4b9/c41/3974b9c41684403dcea98015c424664f.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Bill gates" hspace="10">  Partly. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/45c/f70/76f/45cf7076f99e50fd4a0a8bada708143b.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Kara swisher" hspace="10">  What could be a lot. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/397/4b9/c41/3974b9c41684403dcea98015c424664f.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Bill gates" hspace="10">  Billion-another. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/0a5/6d7/a61/0a56d7a618989cb1576b45356f8dfc9a.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Walt mossberg" hspace="10">  Steve, are you investing in this area? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/cc9/3c3/3fe/cc93c33fe6f9e61eb093cbc87501feb8.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Steve jobs" hspace="10">  Not. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/45c/f70/76f/45cf7076f99e50fd4a0a8bada708143b.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Kara swisher" hspace="10">  Only Prius, and everything? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/cc9/3c3/3fe/cc93c33fe6f9e61eb093cbc87501feb8.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Steve jobs" hspace="10">  Yes, I just appreciate it. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/0a5/6d7/a61/0a56d7a618989cb1576b45356f8dfc9a.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Walt mossberg" hspace="10">  You please <br>  <strong>Don</strong> : Hi.  Don Eklund, Sony Pictures.  My question is, where is too much diversity?  During the discussion, it was already said that microprocessors are now very inexpensive, memory, too, software is abundant.  But my life has become better due to the emergence of standards - programming standards, network standards.  And it seems to me that diversity has reached the point when it prevents the creation of integrating devices that everyone could appreciate.  And whether it will turn, as in the case of health care and public transport, into a genie, which you can‚Äôt drive back to the bottle?  I would like to know your vision of this, is there still the possibility of creating integrating devices that could really simplify and enrich the lives of people. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/0a5/6d7/a61/0a56d7a618989cb1576b45356f8dfc9a.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Walt mossberg" hspace="10">  Steve? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/cc9/3c3/3fe/cc93c33fe6f9e61eb093cbc87501feb8.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Steve jobs" hspace="10">  Well, I think Bill and I will agree here.  No, I suppose it is very difficult to limit imagination and innovation.  I think that new, wonderful inventions will appear constantly.  And I think that this is what we have to put up with in order to get these innovations.  We put up with the fact that innovation exacerbates this diversity. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/397/4b9/c41/3974b9c41684403dcea98015c424664f.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Bill gates" hspace="10">  And I think that the market is very well able to allow diversity where it is appropriate, and get rid of it where it is not needed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/cc9/3c3/3fe/cc93c33fe6f9e61eb093cbc87501feb8.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Steve jobs" hspace="10">  And again to allow there a variety some time later. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/397/4b9/c41/3974b9c41684403dcea98015c424664f.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Bill gates" hspace="10">  Yes.  Yes.  I mean standards and everything.  Internet standards, video formats and similar things have a powerful impact.  And so I do not see what can actually be in the way of the creation of integrating devices.  Of course, you know that there are many different approaches to wireless communication, but all this is in a very healthy state.  Each of them has its advantages.  Some will eventually devour others.  I think that the industry has learned very well to develop and adhere to standards where innovation has more or less ended, and to focus on areas for which it is not yet clear which approach will be the best. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/0a5/6d7/a61/0a56d7a618989cb1576b45356f8dfc9a.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Walt mossberg" hspace="10">  Jesse? <br>  <strong>Jesse</strong> : Hi.  I'm Jesse Kornblat, HeadButler.com.  Since you are no longer the youngest guys in this room, it may be appropriate to ask each of you about your heritage.  Bill, even your fiercest critics admit that your philanthropic activity has a stunning, planetary character, and perhaps if you go further in this direction, you will overshadow everything that you have done at Microsoft. <br>  [Applause] <br>  If you chose heritage, what would you choose?  And you, Steve, do you look at Bill and think: ‚ÄúHow happy is this guy that he has such a talented company that he shouldn‚Äôt personally go there every day, would I like to have that opportunity?‚Äù <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/45c/f70/76f/45cf7076f99e50fd4a0a8bada708143b.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Kara swisher" hspace="10">  OK.  He is not going to answer anyway. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/0a5/6d7/a61/0a56d7a618989cb1576b45356f8dfc9a.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Walt mossberg" hspace="10">  Bill? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/397/4b9/c41/3974b9c41684403dcea98015c424664f.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Bill gates" hspace="10">  Well, the most important work in which I managed to take part, whatever I did there at different times, is a personal computer.  When I grew up, I was a teenager, then 20-30 years old, I even postponed my marriage to later times, before I was absorbed in it.  This is my life's work.  And I am very fortunate that some of my skills and resources, but I will put skills first, which I developed in the process of this work, can now be turned to the benefit of people who do not have access to technology, including medicine.  So having two such things in life is just a blessing.  But if you look into my head, it is all filled with programs, magic programs and faith in them, and this will never change. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/cc9/3c3/3fe/cc93c33fe6f9e61eb093cbc87501feb8.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Steve jobs" hspace="10">  So, you asked, I would like not to go to work at Apple every day? <br>  <strong>Jessie</strong> : No, I asked if you envy Bill that he has this second part of his life ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/cc9/3c3/3fe/cc93c33fe6f9e61eb093cbc87501feb8.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Steve jobs" hspace="10">  Oh no, I think the world ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/45c/f70/76f/45cf7076f99e50fd4a0a8bada708143b.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Kara swisher" hspace="10">  You want to do something else. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/cc9/3c3/3fe/cc93c33fe6f9e61eb093cbc87501feb8.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Steve jobs" hspace="10">  I think the world was the best place, because Bill realized that his goal was not to be the richest guy in the cemetery, right?  This is very good, and he does a lot of good with the help of the money he earned. <br>  I'm sure Bill is like me here.  I mean, we are both from the middle class, even from the lower middle class, and I never really cared about the money.  And Apple was at first so successful that I was very happy because I didn‚Äôt have to worry about money then.  Therefore, I could concentrate on work, and later on my family. <br>  And I look at us as the two happiest people on the planet, because we found what we love to do, and we were in the right place at the right time, and we went to work every day, where we met brilliant people for thirty years, and did what we love to do. <br>  And so it‚Äôs harder to be happier.  Of course the family and all that.  What else can I ask?  Therefore, I do not think about my heritage.  I just think about getting up every morning and going forward with great people, and creating something that other people will love as much as we do.  And if we can do it, that's great. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/0a5/6d7/a61/0a56d7a618989cb1576b45356f8dfc9a.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Walt mossberg" hspace="10">  Yes. <br>  <strong>Rob</strong> : Thank you, Steve and Bill.  Rob Kilton, I'm here with my business partner.  We have a media business on the Internet, about a hundred employees.  What is the most important advice you would give us so that we could try to create at least something comparable to the values ‚Äã‚Äãthat you created in your great companies. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/397/4b9/c41/3974b9c41684403dcea98015c424664f.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Bill gates" hspace="10">  I think that in fact, perhaps in both cases, correct me, if I am wrong, we were excited not because we saw the economic prospects opening up.  Even when we in Microsoft declared ‚ÄúComputer on every desk and in every home‚Äù in 1975, we had no idea that we would become a big company.  Every time I thought, "Oh God, can we double the size?"  Can we manage so many people?  Will it still be interesting?  And each doubling took place like this: well, this is finally the last time.  So the economy has never been in the foreground.  We wanted to be ahead in technology, and do interesting things, and attract different people with different skills who would like this job, and ensure that these different people with different skills work together successfully - that was the main challenge for us.  I made more mistakes in this area than anywhere else, but in the end some of these teams worked very well together.  So this whole story is about people and passion.  It is amazing that this business developed in this way. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/cc9/3c3/3fe/cc93c33fe6f9e61eb093cbc87501feb8.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Steve jobs" hspace="10">  Yes.  You have to really love what you are doing, that‚Äôs quite right.  The reason for this is that it is so hard to do that, without such passion, any sensible person would give up the job.  It is really very difficult.  And you have to withstand this long period of time.  Therefore, if you do not like this work, do not get pleasure from it, you will have to leave it.  And in fact this is what happened with the majority.  If you look at those who became ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù in the eyes of society, and those who did not, then very often those who succeeded loved their work, and therefore were willing to endure when it was very difficult for them.  And those who didn‚Äôt love left it because they are reasonable people.  Who will endure all this if he does not truly love it? <br>  So there is a lot of hard work, constant excitement, and if you do not like it, you will fail.  So first of all, you must love and have passion. <br>  Secondly, you must be very skillful in finding talent, because no matter how capable you are, you need a team of outstanding people, and you must evaluate people very quickly, make decisions about unfamiliar people, hire them and constantly hone your intuition, to build an organization that can ultimately build itself, because you need wonderful people around you. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/0a5/6d7/a61/0a56d7a618989cb1576b45356f8dfc9a.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Walt mossberg" hspace="10">  Liz. <br>  <strong>Liz</strong> : Liz Bayer.  My question is dictated by historical curiosity.  You have come to the same opportunity in completely different ways.  When you think about how you do business, what would each of you want to learn from the other? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/397/4b9/c41/3974b9c41684403dcea98015c424664f.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Bill gates" hspace="10">  I would give a lot to have a taste for Steve.  [Laugh].  It has a natural taste - and this is not a joke at all.  I speak about intuitive taste in relation to people and products.  When we were engaged in the choice of products for Mac, and it was about choosing the software and how best to do these or other things, I considered all this from the point of view of an engineer, because this is how my head is arranged.  And I saw that Steve makes decisions based on his instincts on people and products, and I even find it difficult to explain what I saw.  He makes things completely different, it gives away magic. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/cc9/3c3/3fe/cc93c33fe6f9e61eb093cbc87501feb8.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="Steve jobs" hspace="10">  Woz and I launched a company that made a whole product, so it was not very easy for us to enter into partnership with others.  In fact, Microsoft is one of the few companies we have been able to work with.  Bill and Microsoft didn‚Äôt make a one-piece product, so they were really good at interacting with others.
