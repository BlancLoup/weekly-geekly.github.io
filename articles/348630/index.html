So, Android-developers need to keep abreast of, watching the events and useful blog posts. <br><br>  And where exactly on the Internet to do it?  We have gathered together links to a variety of useful online resources, including our own. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Blogs </h2><br>  Feel free to assume that the hub <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/hub/android_dev/">"Development for Android"</a> is already known to you.  We now sort out the rest.

      The most obvious resource is the official <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/"><b>Android Developers Blog</b></a> , where Google reports all the important news for its part. <br><br>  The rest of Android bloggers often prefer the Medium platform (there are some that still use Google+, but this is an endangered species).  And there were two notable thematic sites working on the same platform: <a href="https://proandroiddev.com/"><b>ProAndroidDev</b></a> and <a href="https://android.jlelse.eu/"><b>AndroidPub</b></a> .  Both are small non-commercial publications: there are simple rules for publications, there are several editors, and anyone can offer to publish their post there (going this way to a wider audience than if they publish it in a regular Medium account). <br><br>  Outside of Medium, there are also noticeable blogs: note the <a href="https://blog.stylingandroid.com/"><b>Styling of Android</b></a> (as it is easy to guess, about UI / UX) and <a href="https://commonsware.com/blog/"><b>CommonsBlog</b></a> (so not about the UI, that the posts do not even have illustrations). <br><br>  If you use an RSS reader, an <a href="https://yadi.sk/d/Am5LjJAP3SBkTH">OPML file</a> may be useful to you, where we have collected all of the above and a number of other blogs - you can see all their updates in one feed. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Twitter </h2><br>  A part of the action is happening on Twitter - who should follow it in order not to miss the interesting and valuable?  Well, of course, <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeWharton"><b>Jake Wharton</b></a> , and then what? <br><br>  Recently, a <a href="https://twitter.com/walmyrcarvalho/lists/android-gdes">Twitter list</a> of hundreds of Google Developer Expert owners was created, allowing you to read them all in one tape.  Not the fact that all this tape will suit you (let's start with the fact that some of its members write in Japanese and Spanish).  But you can read it for several days and decide which of these people you want to add to your personal tape. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Podcasts </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qc/pr/dm/qcprdmhpecsxv0dbosqpi66otvu.png"><br><br>  Let's call five: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://androiddev.apptractor.ru/"><b>Android Dev Podcast</b></a> - everything is already clear by its name (its premiere two years ago, by the way, took place just <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/google/blog/275421/">on Habr√©</a> ) </li><li>  <a href="https://soundcloud.com/podlodka"><b>Podlodka</b></a> - here they consider not specifically Android, but mobile development in general </li><li>  <a href="http://fragmentedpodcast.com/"><b>Fragmented</b></a> - the main English-language Android podcast </li><li>  <a href="http://androidbackstage.blogspot.ru/"><b>Android Developers Backstage</b></a> - English-language podcast, created directly by Googlers </li><li>  <a href="http://talkingkotlin.com/"><b>Talking Kotlin</b></a> - English-language podcast from JetBrains about understandable which language </li></ul><br><hr><br><h2>  Video </h2><br>  The "subscribe" button is also on YouTube - on which channels should it be clicked? <br><br>  There is an official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/androiddevelopers"><b>Android Developers</b></a> - there are announcements, and records from Google I / O, and not only. <br><br>  There are many channels where videos of reports are posted: from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/JetBrainsTV/">JetBrains TV</a> , where all the reports from KotlinConf are available, to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG70q1HRspLdd93HW94WS-A/featured">Mobius</a> conference.  To list everything is meaningless - if a conference is close to you personally, enter the name in the YouTube search and with high probability you will find its channel. <br><br>  There is a small project <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMEmNnHT69aZuaOrE-dF6ug"><b>Android Dialogs</b></a> - mostly there are video interviews with notable members of the community, and right now there is a series of videos in a curious format, ‚Äúthe presenter with the guest opens Android Studio together and understands Dagger‚Äù. <br><br>  And outside of YouTube from regularly updated there is, for example, <a href="https://caster.io/">caster.io</a> - a site with short training videos for mobile developers, each of which reveals a specific question.  Some of the videos are free, some are paid. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Reddit </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pq/vo/eo/pqvoeo_uwau_ccviel5vx-gdvmq.png"><br><br>  Reddit (and, in particular, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/"><b>Developing Android Apps</b></a> subreddit of interest to us) differs in format from everything else in this text.  Most of the entries are links to some other site, but there is also unique content.  A rare case for the Internet is when comments are more valuable than the original record (among active commentators there is Jake Wharton, and in general this is an opportunity to see a slice of community opinions).  Often post some nonsense or questions that place on the Stack Overflow, but upvotay help to notice among the records are worth.  Sometimes they are satisfied with the Ask Me Anything format, when representatives of a certain project answer any questions about it. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Digests </h2><br>  Perhaps, at this moment, instead of the question ‚Äúwhere to get new information,‚Äù you are already interested in the question ‚Äúhow not to break from new information‚Äù.  There are many useful resources on the Internet, but personal resources for studying them are not endless - it‚Äôs hard to follow Medium, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit and podcasts right away. <br><br>  Here help digests, the authors of which monitor what is happening and collect the most noticeable in a convenient collection.  Studying a weekly digest is much easier than jumping every day on a bunch of tapes in different services.  Let's name a few: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://androidweekly.net/"><b>Android Weekly</b></a> - the main Android digest in the world </li><li>  <a href="http://www.kotlinweekly.net/"><b>Kotlin Weekly</b></a> - here specifically about Kotlin, distributed as a mailing list, but if you prefer the web, follow the links <a href="https://twitter.com/kotlinweekly">from Twitter</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://t.me/droidgr"><b>Android Good Reads</b></a> - Russian Telegram channel of <b>Egor Tolstoy</b> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/everydaytools/blog/348246/"><b>The digest of interesting materials for the mobile developer</b></a> - you can know this series of habposts yourself (there is both Android and iOS) </li></ul><br>  And finally, we ourselves (JUG.ru Group, organizers of the <b>Mobius</b> conference) recently began publishing <a href="https://jug.ru/category/posts/android/">our own Android digest</a> .  We have already become a tradition of a weekly selection of ‚Äúserver-side Java‚Äù news on jug.ru - and now we have decided that this site can be useful for those who use Java / Kotlin for Android. <br><br>  Why another digest, when they have already created a whole series around the world?  Some things seem important to us, and did not see that they were all embodied somewhere: <br><br><ul><li>  We want to make a digest not an impersonal set of links, but a lively whole text that is interesting and useful, even if you do not follow any links from it.  In addition to the links themselves, there can be found both a valuable context and caustic sarcasm. </li><li>  We think it's better when the digest is written in Russian.  It is clear that most Android developers are doing well with English, and links from the digest in most cases lead to English-speaking resources.  But when you want to quickly and without stress understand what happened in a week, the native language remains out of competition. </li><li>  We are not trying to ‚Äúcollect in general everything that has appeared in a week,‚Äù but choose what seemed most interesting and important.  Of course, this choice is partly subjective and may not coincide with someone else. </li><li>  We want not only to collect blog posts, but also to cover events, allowing us to understand not only ‚Äúwhat was written this week‚Äù, but also ‚Äúwhat happened this week‚Äù.  From updating Android Studio to a particularly vivid discussion on Reddit, everything that helps to stay in the context of what is happening. </li></ul><br>  In general, now every Thursday in the evening on jug.ru appears on the text of the past week, here <a href="https://jug.ru/2018/02/android-digest/">today</a> .  In order not to miss new issues, you can subscribe to either <a href="https://jug.ru/category/posts/android/feed/">the RSS</a> digest or the Mobius <a href="https://twitter.com/mobiusconf">Twitter account</a> (later we want to add the ability to subscribe by mail). <br><br>  Surely, we ourselves do not know all the useful Android resources, and for sure our digest can be done better - so we will be happy to add comments and suggestions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/348630/">https://habr.com/ru/post/348630/</a></p>
