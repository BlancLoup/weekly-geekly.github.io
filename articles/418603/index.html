How does all this work? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ao/rh/x2/aorhx2g_iilqdkgoxoxrzrlulqe.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Matrix Powerwatch is perhaps one of the most interesting crowdfunding cases from the point of view of commerce.  First, at the time of the appearance of the campaign on Indiegogo, all the largest publications in the world and in Russia, <a href="https://habr.com/post/399123/">including here,</a> instantly wrote about watches. <br><br>  Secondly, without any detailed reviews, paid advertising and other similar demand for watches - crazy, and the only one cited everywhere (in general, there is) the advantage of these watches - they have an "eternal" charge.  The watch does not need to be charged ever, or rather, they charge while you are wearing them.  This feature seems to bring us closer to solving the important problem of modern wearable gadgets, but so far it works only locally - in the Matrix smart watch.

      <b>only if?</b> <br><br>  The idea lay on the surface for a long time, and the first prototypes that would work on the thermoelectric principle have been <a href="https://doensen.home.xs4all.nl/p.html">known since 1980</a> , but at that time the project was not commercially viable.  Twenty years later, the idea was returned to <a href="https://www.thewatchsite.com/21-japanese-watch-discussion-forum/215409-little-hot-cold-citizen-eco-drive-thermo.html">Citizen</a> (Eco-Drive Termo), and nowadays Matrix Industries. <br><br>  <b>Criticism and mistrust</b> <br><br>  In the network, manufacturers were instantly branded as charlatans, referring to the fact that the only way to convert heat into energy - through the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582_%25D0%259F%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2582%25D1%258C%25D0%25B5">Peltier</a> Effect - will not be able to ‚Äúpower‚Äù the clock, since the resource of the whole human body is approx.  100 W / h, and therefore from the wrist - much less. <br><br>  However, the manufacturers have joined the corresponding branch on Reddit and, it seems, a compromise of opinions has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5hbp7w/eli5_how_does_the_matrix_powerwatch_work/">reached</a> .  In this case, one of the conditions for the performance of these watches is a low-power processor, on the basis of which they operate: MCU - Ambiq Apollo. <br><br>  Thus, it turns out that our body is really a good docking station, which is fully capable of powering the watch-pedometer. <br><br>  <b>And what happened in the end?</b> <br><br>  As a result, today we have <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/matrix.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dmatrix%26utm_campaign%3Dmatrix">three Powerwatch models</a> with price spreads from 19990 to 27990 rubles. <br><br>  <b>Matrix Powerwatch and Matrix Powerwatch Black OPS</b> <br><br>  The basic Matrix models are a watch-pedometer.  In addition to the external differences in the color of the "bezel" they have no other, except that the equipment is slightly different: there is an additional interchangeable strap in the Black OPS box. <br><br>  <b>Powerwatch</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pc/ku/va/pckuvaqmlc_n0dxt17er9cd8cxk.jpeg"><br><br>  The watches look quite impressive and stylish, but at the same time they are quite light and pleasantly sit on the hand, do not crush. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/os/an/7y/osan7y6chsped3bazzqz0hxaofk.jpeg"><br><br>  <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/matrix-powerwatch.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dmatrix%26utm_campaign%3Dpowerwatch">The simplest</a> "Matrixes" are completed with a textile strap, a napkin and a screwdriver. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nz/k4/ga/nzk4gacylk2ona1zu_o1gqnqb-a.jpeg"><br><br>  The clock is not touch, and is controlled by two buttons and a ‚Äúcrown‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Black ops</b> <br><br>  Since there is practically no difference between the two clocks, as has already been said, a few words about model management let us use the example of the <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/matrix-powerwatch-umnye-chasy-kotorye-ne-nuzhno-zarjazhat-black-ops-pack.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dmatrix%26utm_campaign%3Dblackops">second ‚Äúblack‚Äù model</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gf/-i/pb/gf-ipbjmspjwckftv-datud4tqw.jpeg"><br><br>  The main menu of the watch includes several sections, switching between them by a quick press of the top button: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0k/c7/h_/0kc7h_rfp77bk79bk6ful3pdmf4.gif"><br><br>  To get to a subcategory of a particular menu, you must wait a second after pressing: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fd/ts/9o/fdts9okqzcriociatrstb5yzid4.gif"><br><br>  Where there are additional ‚Äúsubmenus‚Äù, switching between them is done with the help of the scroll wheel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oy/bu/cz/oybuczo-oburrol9fzuqvxked8a.gif"><br><br>  There is nothing intricate in control: it is intuitively understandable.  He pressed, pressed and waited, pressed and twisted.  In general, you can cope. <br><br>  Black OPS looks very prestigious, after all, black is black. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p1/5q/1d/p15q1dqmcvwva1r7ksvmhbcp0ge.jpeg"><br><br>  On the side all the same buttons: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u5/2r/fc/u52rfcjp024jkvxdhjum3vg3ku4.jpeg"><br><br>  The clock screen is monochrome, but is read without much difficulty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ge/ho/a4/gehoa4wgxie_jwryulpkyislix4.jpeg"><br><br>  At the same time for the dark time of the day is provided, albeit rather pale, but the backlight.  It is activated by pressing and holding the top button: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iz/yn/bm/izynbmpytm8nrokagcrcmawozr8.gif"><br><br>  The model is completed with two straps, one of which is textile, the second - steel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yd/4f/od/yd4fodkafgfcbx43itztwgk-_qu.jpeg"><br><br>  In fact, it‚Äôs funny when you open the gadget and by inertia you are still looking for some kind of wire, docking station, charging connector, and then you understand ... It produces an effect, especially considering the size of the box in which the Power Panels are placed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1d/tp/ph/1dtpphxb7178476mbiqjfautfls.jpeg"><br><br>  Both models act as a pedometer, a counter of consumed calories, and this item is particularly highlighted: it is believed that Matrix analysis of calories is very accurate because they really analyze the energy consumed.  Also, the watch has a running mode and sleep analysis.  In the sleep analysis mode, the clock must be transferred manually: by holding the lower ‚ÄúSET‚Äù button. <br><br>  <b>Powerwatch x</b> <br><br>  Almost the same, but slightly larger, slightly harder and already with notifications - the latest model of the <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/matrix-powerwatch-x.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dmatrix%26utm_campaign%3Dx">Matrix Powerwatch X.</a>  In terms of management, it is similar, and the main differences are in increased waterproofing and the ability to receive notifications from a smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1x/wi/lb/1xwilbto0f3hx2p3otmcoreaf-u.png"><br><br>  Watches are also available in an impressive gift box: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qk/jv/ka/qkjvkagg9gq276cq-czikpix1po.jpeg"><br><br>  But there is a rather interesting equipment: the watch comes with something like a heating pad that can serve as a docking station. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qi/he/g4/qiheg4zjoyboktdnefokktceyci.jpeg"><br><br>  Such a ‚Äúhot-water bottle‚Äù is connected via MicroUSB to the network and generally performs its functions.  Actually monitor how Matrix can be charged in real time.  The main screen is divided into two parts.  One of them shows the difference between the temperatures of the skin and the environment, and, accordingly, the colder and warmer the skin is, the more intense the watches are charged.  The second screen is ‚ÄúReal Time‚Äù, where it is shown how the watch is charged at a particular moment - this is reflected in the form of tick marks in a circle: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fg/s-/3n/fgs-3nvztzobavvketa7vfwqy1q.png"><br><br>  Model X looks cool! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zd/n7/nh/zdn7nhwculkgyazqqxtzjd9bg-e.jpeg"><br><br>  It is made in black with delicate bright inserts: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mu/uo/18/muuo18omhkqhgtxkc2auq8746dy.jpeg"><br><br>  Equipped with an "X" single silicone strap. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6w/lq/wm/6wlqwmbgpzueqkuarq4skqmem-a.jpeg"><br><br>  The main element of the design are screws on the body.  Not Hublot, of course, but it looks great.  In terms of assembly, there are no complaints, all elements are well fitted, nothing protrudes, does not protrude, does not fall apart: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ap/pg/v3/appgv3ufe1fntiw8i4ulkebfwp8.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Synchronization</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/om/zg/bm/omzgbmmfwhfl0eo7gzvap9okek0.png"><br><br>  All three models work in tandem with the proprietary application Matrix (it has already been localized) for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/matrix-powerwatch/id1296727127%3Fmt%3D8">IOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.matrix.powerwatch%26hl%3Dru">Android</a> . <br><br>  The connection process is the same for all three devices: for a start, you will be asked to choose one of the models: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ed/b7/2e/edb72ei7vrt41secrocnfcl3s-0.gif"><br><br>  Then perform a few simple combinations using the buttons: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/r_/3w/uo/r_3wuo-_zhirwxm14kfeww62ddc.jpeg"><br><br>  The application itself is not very intricate.  The main screen is the statistics of activity and sleep. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hj/kh/t4/hjkht4psg_m0qkikwxi-zb3_dxw.png"><br><br>  Immersed inside, you can see the statistics for a longer period: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ys/tg/6e/ystg6euhxh1kmkxkiqmy1fw-l5q.gif"><br><br>  And by selecting the desired date, you can see the activity details during the day, which is relevant for all measured parameters: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/al/fs/ge/alfsgej5p2mfcqv685kg2cf5fie.gif"><br><br>  Scrolling a little lower on the main screen, you will be taken to the jogging menu, where sports results will be saved: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ze/rd/0s/zerd0sgti2irame4xd9ukvbpnge.png"><br><br>  The second menu of the application is ‚Äúsocial‚Äù - where your Matrix owners will be.  And the third - the profile settings menu and the clock.  There are not so many possibilities: changing the language, adjusting the profile and photo, choosing a measurement system and setting activity goals. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qn/1h/_r/qn1h_rkvdhy_wjqp6b5l8-4cmlo.jpeg"><br><br>  By connecting the clock, you can select the dial (the function is announced for the next month), as well as set the mode for receiving notifications.  Now the clock interface is also being translated into Russian, so temporarily notifications do not recognize Russian text. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zs/__/0q/zs__0qkzoomg0mucrrwohti4pyq.jpeg"><br><br>  A strange feature, perhaps, is the process of viewing data.  Statistics are immediately written to the cloud, and when you change the device, you lose nothing, but there is a downside: if the smartphone is not connected to the network, then you will not have access to the statistics.  So it goes. <br><br>  <b>And what is the result?</b> <br><br>  I must admit that the clock turned out.  And let Matrix are not the first to set such a goal, but the first to bring it to the serial device, even if it is not the cheapest. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yf/f7/w3/yff7w3dtu41-n8cv2a3bojnklsk.jpeg"><br><br>  The clock is working properly and all the functions that the manufacturer stated are present (and some will be present very soon).  The atmosphere of mystery is still preserved, but the promised charge divisions do appear and disappear as promised, which makes an impression. <br><br>  The design was worked out and in this sense no sacrifices were made in favor of technology.  All three models are <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/matrix.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dmatrix%26utm_campaign%3Dmatrix">already available</a> in Russia. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/418603/">https://habr.com/ru/post/418603/</a></p>
