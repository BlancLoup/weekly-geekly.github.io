This is important for building many new processes and for increasing the efficiency of existing procedures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d6/0aa/a89/2d60aaa895db452db4753e7cc73ef4a4.png">

      The potential of the Internet of Things lies not in the performance and design features of equipment, sensors, controllers and other terminals connected by a single communications network, but in ideas and solutions, in technologies and models that can be realized with its help.  Only on how reasonable will the approach to the development of IoT depend on its future. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <i>Internet of things for business objects - all parts:</i> <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/25334/">Part 1.

Potential </h2><br>  Interaction in the global information network is associated with various security issues and is subject to serious risks.  The active expansion of the quantity and quality of objects included in the constant information exchange, and even capable of independently implementing meaningful actions, sets unprecedented challenges for IoT technologies. <br><br>  The future development of the Internet of Things should include the following areas: <br><br><h4>  I. The development of things on the Internet </h4><br><ol><li>  Technical and technological development of things <br><ol><li>  The emergence of new things or new functionality of existing things </li><li>  Expansion and improvement of the functional quality of things </li><li>  Development (complication) of the physical and logical structure of things </li></ol><br></li><li>  The development of autonomy of things <br><ol><li>  The development of direct autonomy and stability of things, i.e.  its stable and independent of a variety of factors interaction, subject to the occurrence of special situations or adverse events </li><li>  The development of alternative autonomy things, i.e.  additional possibilities of interaction of a thing even with its actual absence or suspension of activity (for example, reservation, caching, substitution) </li><li>  Development of autonomous communities of things that allow you to support the work not of a single thing, but of a separate functionality or even the implementation of individual tasks, regardless of the state of individual members of such communities </li></ol><br></li><li>  Interface development of things <br><ol><li>  The complexity of interfaces in quantitative and qualitative parameters </li><li>  Development of structured interfaces (including anonymous, functional, dynamic) </li><li>  Development of interface infrastructure (services) and surrogate interfaces (role-based interface types, for example, managers, intermediaries, gatekeepers) </li></ol><br></li></ol><br><h4>  Ii.  Developing the effectiveness and efficiency of the Internet of Things </h4><br><ol><li>  Development of a system for setting goals and objectives in IoT <br><ol><li>  Complication and expansion of the system of setting goals and objectives in terms of identifying and formalizing the needs implemented by various things and users within the framework of the target interaction </li><li>  Development of a system for setting goals and objectives in terms of their specification, study, validity, suitability for implementation as part of the target interaction in IoT (quantitative and qualitative development of the design of goals) </li><li>  Development of a system of linking and compromise achievement of projected goals and objectives developed in the structure regarding the interaction of things in the IoT </li></ol><br></li><li>  Development of integrated coordination of IoT goals and objectives <br><ol><li>  Development of methods and technologies for linking goals and structure of tasks within the framework of the compromise interaction of things in the network, including the development of the technology of ‚Äúpromoting and protecting‚Äù own project goals and objectives </li><li>  Development of methods and means of forecasting, controlling, protecting and influencing the special situations arising from the interaction, including: conflicts of interest, destructive events, violations of integrity, unstable conditions, highly risky actions </li><li>  Development of a system for analyzing, controlling, and coordinating goals and objectives in the context of changes in the internal and external environment of network communications </li></ol><br></li><li>  Development of a system for optimizing and monitoring results in IoT <br><ol><li>  Development of a system for the formalization of goals and objectives in terms of determining key indicators of their attainability, measurability, relevance and objectivity </li><li>  Development of a system of integrated analytics of the effectiveness and efficiency of planned and achieved goals, projected and solved tasks in general and in areas </li><li>  Development of a system of linked design, control and coordination of goals and objectives implemented in the framework of interaction in the Internet of Things </li></ol><br></li></ol><br><h4>  Iii.  Internet of Things Management Development </h4><br><ol><li>  Regulatory System Development <br><ol><li>  Expansion of the spectrum and detailing of the regulatory system through the introduction and improvement of various standards, typical and sample procedures, rules and technologies </li><li>  Complication and expansion of regulations in terms of ensuring complex, complexly structured goals and objectives, implemented by interacting things (including taking into account the principles of competition of goals) </li><li>  Systematization and classification of regulations with the introduction of mandatory, recommended, alternative and competitive types of them </li></ol><br></li><li>  Development of technical and technological infrastructure <br><ol><li>  Development of technical means used by things for effective interaction with other things, as well as technical means accompanying (ensuring) such interaction </li><li>  The development of technology interaction of things within the target network and related technologies that ensure sustainable effective interaction </li><li>  Development of special technologies for interaction of things from the IoT environment with other physical or virtual systems (networks, structures, mechanisms, etc.) </li></ol><br></li><li>  Organizational development <br><ol><li>  Development of the management system of things (expansion and complication of design, planning, organization, control and coordination in relation to things that are involved in networking) </li><li>  Development of a system for managing the interaction of things (expanding and complicating the design, planning, organization, control and coordination of individual, sequential or complex transactions carried out by things on the network as part of the target interaction) </li><li>  Development of the Internet of things management system (expansion and complication of design, planning, organization, control and coordination in relation to the full effective creation and implementation of the interaction of things in the interaction network, as well as in relation to the interaction of IoT with other systems) </li></ol><br></li></ol><br>  The Internet of things is impossible in a confined and confined space.  This is a system that requires such extensive and diverse knowledge, tools, technologies, standards, research and practical skills that it is impossible to develop IoT outside the global coordinated community.  But this means that certain advantages that a user receives from the Internet of things are not in the strict sense unique and personalized competitive advantages, because they are accessible to a wide range of stakeholders. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/707/7d0/54f/7077d054f3d04c0b83096482b046c457.png"><br><br>  The Internet of things is basically formed and will be shaped by the leaders of the IT market, since it depends largely on technical and technological innovations.  But the generation of ideas and their initial testing are possible in the framework of personal projects, startup-businesses, corporate spin-offs or other small mobile formats. <br><br>  <i><a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/25588/">(continuation - Part 4.
