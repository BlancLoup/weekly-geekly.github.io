  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Workplace in the field</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Almost all descriptions of how to create a mobile workspace in the field are reduced to telecommunications and living conditions: how to access the Internet, which devices to place, etc.  The fact that all this advanced technological beauty without power supply turns into a pumpkin pile of scrap metal is usually left behind the brackets.  Fill this gap. <br><br>  <b>Mobility = speed</b> <br><br>  This is why a mobile work point is called that it can be quickly deployed and also quickly minimized.  Elimination of accidents, geological exploration, open air events - everywhere you need to act quickly, sometimes the score goes on for minutes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Mankind has not yet invented a faster way to electrify the site than installing a diesel power station.  The diesel power station is compact, it can be quickly brought and taken away after completion of work.  Some of them are produced on the chassis, which can be attached to the car.  More powerful options are mounted on a separate trailer.  All that is needed to start it is fuel.

Just because here even the slightest failure is synonymous with losses for many, many millions of rubles.  An accidental breaking of the circuit, someone pulled the switch - and now the synchronous generator is demagnetized and the entire diesel power plant fails.  The situation, alas, is not uncommon for generators with mechanical regulators of engine rotation, which, to save, many manufacturers continue to install. <br><br>  To avoid such excesses, choose diesel power plants with electronic power switches equipped with thermal and electromagnetic releasers.  The reasoning that the household automatic load device will cope with this will be referred to as amateur.  And it is important that the power plant has an electronic engine management system.  It will provide better control of the diesel engine during cold start or abrupt overload. <br><br>  The second aspect of the reliability of a mobile power station is a controller with a protection function.  It mates with sensors controlling the operation of a diesel engine and a synchronous generator in order to make an emergency stop when overloaded, overheated, lowered the level of oil, coolant or failure of the generator.  Without an emergency stop, the diesel power plant will simply fail in the first emergency situation. <br><br>  <b>Noise problem</b> <br><br>  If during the work of emergency services, farms or oil rigs, the problem of noise is secondary, then for urban conditions it comes to the fore.  A cheaper option - an open design on a steel frame - is unacceptable here, you need to choose a unit with a noise-protective casing, with it you can reduce the noise level to 65 dB. <br><br>  <b>terms of Use</b> <br><br>  When a diesel power station is used as an autonomous power source, it is worth thinking about protection from the external environment.  And from the people, of course.  More precisely, from the Vandals.  To protect against weather conditions, generators are produced in containers, and for protection against vandals, there are options in 20-foot sea containers of increased strength.  This protection is enough to safely leave a massive generator on the court. <br><br>  What else to look for: synchronous and asynchronous generators <br>  In simple terms, the difference between them is this: asynchronous generators are cheaper, but the accuracy of voltage support is about 10%, so they cannot be used to power high-precision equipment.  That is, it is extremely undesirable to hold concerts with them or to feed the scientific equipment. <br><br>  A synchronous generator in a diesel power station maintains voltage with an accuracy of 4-5%.  They easily cope with the supply of power tools and electric motors, in which the reactive load reaches 65% of the nominal value. <br><br>  <b>Tricks of picking</b> <br><br>  So, you have decided on the parameters of a diesel power station, but when you buy you will find one unobvious trick.  Many companies indicate an attractive price, modestly silent that it does not include mufflers and batteries, putting them in the category of additional options.  But this is the same as selling a car, and offering wheels to it as an option.  Therefore, when calculating a diesel power station, consider its cost along with a silencer, batteries, and also readiness for work: the station is filled with oil and all process fluids.  Diligent seller indicates the price only in the complete set. <br><br>  <b>Brand constructor</b> <br><br>  Now it remains to choose a brand.  Here, on the one hand, everything is difficult, but on the other - there are several key criteria.  There are first-tier manufacturers - FG Wilson, WattStream, Honda.  Their diesel generators are of high quality, but very expensive.  Russian and Belarusian generators are much cheaper, but these are the same old models, put on the conveyor back in the Soviet Union in the 50‚Äì70s of the 20th century.  Outdated, uneconomical, unreliable.  Therefore, in terms of the price-quality ratio, I would draw attention to the power plants, the ‚Äúdesigners‚Äù.  They are assembled from components of world brands; serious savings are obtained due to the low cost of labor in Russia. <br><br>  <b>We take into account all the problems and requirements</b> <br><br>  The criteria for selecting a diesel power plant for a mobile work point that I described are the result of many years of practice.  We collected all the requirements for the work of mobile groups and tried to take them into account in our <a href="http://gc-azimut.ru/">Azimuth</a> mobile diesel power stations. <br><br>  These are the ‚Äúdesigners who are best suited for Russian conditions.  They are inexpensive, but equipped with reliable hubs from Western manufacturers.  Each model before being tested under various load conditions.  If you find factory problems on the stand, they are immediately eliminated.  With warranty service and spare parts from our power plants, the situation is better than that of first-tier brands, which simply do not have time to establish a dealer network here.  We produce them in the most sought-after versions: stationary and portable, beskapotnymi and bonnet, with a capacity from 8 kW to 640 kW.  All of our diesel power stations are equipped with AVR auto start, electric starter and maintenance-free batteries as standard. <br><br>  For long-term work, we have prepared versions of a mobile power station in a kunge with two compartments.  The engine room houses a diesel generator, fuel tanks, batteries, and in the operator compartment there is a control panel, fire extinguishers, a first aid kit, grounding pins and other equipment. <br><br>  Choose a power plant for your tasks and immediately start working in any, even the most extreme conditions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370283/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370283/</a></p>
