      Naturally, this situation could not arrange us.  After long searches, meditations, prayers and rites, we finally found the main cause of all our troubles - an incomplete, contradictory technical task.  After we changed our approach to working on this insanely important document and were able to competently produce it to our customers - we all became happy.  The company began to earn, customers began to earn and everyone began to smile more. <br><br>  Mother Teresa once said: "To preserve happiness, they need to share."  Following the precepts of a great man, we share the formula found with the community. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/7cc/f18/40e/7ccf1840ebed66c085b06ed1e5dd0e18.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At once, we say that, since the work on the TOR is going on from both the client and the developer, there are recommendations for both parties.  In this article we will consider recommendations to the customer.  In the next article, we will definitely consider recommendations for the performer. <br><br><h4>  <b>What should I do if the Executors with whom you ordered the site ‚Äústarted‚Äù the project?</b> </h4><br>  To begin, let's define what a successful project is?  This is a project that during the planned period at least paid for the costs of it.  Everything.  Including rental of hosting and the salary of your manager, who fills the site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/a03/415/119/a034151198aa23d5b93061c3f2e31842.jpg" alt="image"><br><blockquote>  <b>So:</b> If you cannot calculate the income from the project or the amount of expenses, or if the project does not pay off, congratulations, you are ‚Äúlaid it down‚Äù. </blockquote>  Of course, you can blame developers for incompetence, change them, sue them.  But according to our data, in the overwhelming majority of cases, this definitely will not lead to the successful delivery of the project on time.  Moreover, turning to other performers, you have a high chance of getting the same situation. <br><br>  The fact is that a good, savvy customer can achieve the desired result even from a bad web studio, in effect acting as an organizer of work for a poorly coordinated team.  And an inexperienced customer who believes that ‚Äúyou are professionals, make me well‚Äù will not get the desired result even by contacting a cool company. <br><blockquote>  <b>This is important:</b> To ensure that you get the desired result, you must professionally order a website. </blockquote><br><h4>  <b>What you need to do to order a professional site?</b> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/eae/304/567/eae304567ee2040b2858868d53fb11d3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>1. Stop thinking that the site is being made for you.</b> <br><br>  With this paradox, most customers cannot cope.  ‚ÄúHow is it that I pay money!  The site should like me! ‚ÄùForget.  No one cares if your site likes you, your wife or your company's department.  The site should appeal to its visitors.  The opinion of your wife or sister can be taken into account only if you decide to make money on them. <br><br>  <b>2. Well, very well imagine your client.</b> <br><br>  Damn, we do not understand how some companies work and do not know who buys their services.  Remember the previous point?  How do you plan to determine a good or bad website if you do not know who should like it? <br><br>  <b>3. Stop making programmers smart.</b> <br><br>  No kidding.  Every person is intelligent within his competence.  I program well in PHP, but when I have to whitewash the walls, I am a fool.  Explain your business, your task, the scheme of work, your specifics.  You do not ask?  Explain anyway.  Refuse to listen?  Come to the office of the company and kill one by one programmer until the manager listens to you. <br><br>  <b>4. Remember: programming is only 30% of the work on the project.</b> <br><br>  There are a lot of programmers on the market now.  You will easily find the most different.  But your customers are deeply perpendicular how well the database or application architecture is designed.  Moreover, most of the projects on the web, in terms of programming, are relatively simple, typical things.  Your clients can only attract a competent marketing policy in conjunction with a thoughtful SEO.  To keep them on the site and provide a conversion can only thoughtful interface.  Only an experienced analyst can competently reflect all the nuances of your business in your website.  Never.  Never order a site until diverse specialists have worked on your concept and have not compiled these documents. <br><br>  <b>5. TK without a marketing analysis, prototypes of ALL interfaces, an SEO report and a detailed, concrete, unambiguous description of each function is really just a piece of paper.</b> <br><br>  You can throw it out.  Why?  See the previous paragraph.  Moreover, you need to accept the following facts: <br><ul><li>  No, you cannot make a marketing analysis yourself.  Even if you have been working as a marketer at Eldorado for 20 years.  The web has its own specifics, you must have experience in this particular area. </li><li>  No, you cannot create interface prototypes yourself.  If only because it is a group work.  In which necessarily participate: technical specialist, designer, manager, marketer, seo specialist.  If you don‚Äôt have a technician in the group, for example, you run the risk of developing an interface whose implementation will require disproportionately large money and effort. </li><li>  No, you cannot make an SEO report yourself.  However, this is usually the majority of customers have no doubt. </li><li>  And finally: no, you cannot write your own TK.  Because the detailed description for you, for the programmer and for the court (in the case of a critical situation) are three big differences.  In short, stop looking for bad, not working ways to reduce the cost of the project and do something useful. </li></ul><br>  <b>6. Carefully read the documentation you are sending and are responsible for the key decisions.</b> <br><br>  You do business.  A web studio or a programmer has his own business, with its own laws, which may not only be different, but also contradict your laws.  The duty of the web studio is to provide you with information that is contained in the TOR and reports.  And your duty is to make a final decision and bring it to the company.  Do not forget about it. <br><br><h4>  <b>Where is the happiness?</b> </h4><br>  Happiness comes when you, having spent money, effort and time, will observe the successful result of your labors.  Because nothing is better than seeing the results of your efforts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/7c9/726/302/7c97263025b569abde2545c41b28ec06.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><blockquote>  <b>And remember:</b> nothing is worse than investing money, taking care of your client‚Äôs duties carelessly, and then feeling deceived. </blockquote>  Good luck to you and your projects! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285800/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285800/</a></p>
