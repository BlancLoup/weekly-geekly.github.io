Unselfish.  He must understand what his team lives with, what he likes to the people with whom he works.  After the ‚Äústormy night‚Äù of release, it should be more important for him that the developers suffered.  In addition, he must understand that he is responsible for nightly meetings, except for all the evil bosses and bosses there, because  he represents the interests of developers in the "higher circles". <br><br>  Developers are often ready to help and meet.  Especially when it comes to their own mistakes and errors.  If I announced certain deadlines and I cannot meet them, I will agree to stay at work or come early, but I will try to keep the word.  Another question - when I voiced the term, it was cut in half, and they kick me for not being able to meet it.  But I obviously could not keep within it, since I needed twice as much time.  Here, precisely here, at the planning stage, the PM must first stand up for its programmer, and defend the time given to them.  but he should also monitor the completion of the task on time.  If you need to - to remind you that tomorrow is surrender.  It is possible to view intermediate results of work.  This will help to understand what kind of world you are.

      Well, PM defended the time that the programmer announced, proved that he was objective, explained that it‚Äôs better not to save on matches and salt, because porridge cannot be cooked without them, and so on.  But the next day comes.  New job.  Hot, so to speak.  So here.  At this stage - it is very important not to forget that the deadlines given on the fulfillment of the current task are being moved apart.  And the time for its implementation will be in any case more, because a person needs some time to switch between tasks.  If the plans do not move, then we either break the deadlines, or force the developer to spend their personal time.  Both of them demotivate, which, in turn, slows down development. <br><br>  Coped.  Have done all the burning tasks, all the current, all the sleepless nights behind.  Here it is important to remember that the project did not the PM, but the whole team.  Summarize.  To say what was good and what needs to be corrected.  And more objectivity.  If you have forced a person to work overtime, please note that and suggest options to exclude similar incidents in the future, or at least minimize such risks. <br><br>  <b>Sausages</b> <br><br>  Sausages - deliberately false motivation.  ‚ÄúWe will deliver the project, then ...‚Äù, ‚ÄúWe will develop this piece, then ...‚Äù, well, all such statements.  Sooner or later we all understand that the sausage we are chasing just flies in front of us, and we will not be able to catch it, because the stick on which it hangs is tied to our back.  Be realistic.  Tell me honestly: ‚Äúguys, we have a lot of jam‚Äù, ‚Äúwe will have to be tight‚Äù.  Think everyone will run away?  I doubt it.  The difficulties may not bring people together, but at least we understand the light on which we are, which is very important. <br><br>  To solve a problem, you need to localize and voice it.  otherwise it will be in the air.  everyone will feel that something confuses them, but, remembering about "sausages", they will not dare to voice it.  you will sound - you will lose sausages.  here and run after her.  In addition, if you yourself do not believe that the sausage will fall into your mouth, the people around you will only be able to entertain themselves.  But the motivation from this will not increase. <br><br>  In the pursuit of sausages you can help simple tools such as planning, code review and refactoring.  Having planned everything carefully, you will have an idea about the date of contact with the sausage.  The code review will tell you if the sausage has escaped from under your nose, and refactoring will help return the escaped sausage. <br><br>  A request for new functionality has arrived.  We planned it.  Implemented.  We are sitting, waiting for a sausage.  Due to the lack of a code review, we learn that everything we have worked on for many days, at least, is working incorrectly and not optimally.  And for the lack of refactoring, we will be condemned to eternal wandering around the bug-tracking system and code in search of the very last bug behind which the sausage rests.  But, as we all know, he will always be the last. <br><br>  <b>That light</b> <br><br>  Check your vital signs daily.  Buy yourself tonometers, tachometers, heart rate monitors, oscilloscopes, and anything else that can help with this, and use it for its intended purpose.  In the absence of signs of life on your part, the sausage will get to another.  Your project should at least move, so that you can finish it.  If the patient is more dead than alive (like Philip Dick), only Ubik will help you.  Or palmistry.  Or spiritualism.  Anything that can help communicate with those who are no longer with us.  better to warn than to deal with the consequences. <br><br>  And let your project live long.  But not too long living in development. <br><br>  <i>When writing this post, no manager was hurt.</i>  <i>The words ‚Äúmust,‚Äù ‚Äúmust,‚Äù refer to euphemic categories, and are real only in my ‚Äúparallel reality‚Äù.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>and, yes ... forget about everything that I wrote if your programmers write the perfect code.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/59693/">https://habr.com/ru/post/59693/</a></p>
