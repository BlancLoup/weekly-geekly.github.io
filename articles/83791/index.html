  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About RBK Money support service</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, dear fellows, I am extremely indignant! <br><br>  And the reason for my indignation was the <b>communication with the support service of the electronic payment system RBK Money.</b>  I will explain the situation from the very beginning. <br><br>  The fact is that I urgently needed to make a money transfer in the amount of 5,000 rubles from my Yandex.Money wallet to the WebMoney wallet of one of my employees.  But since from a certain time it was extremely problematic to do so, then on the advice of friends it was decided to use a clever translation scheme: Yandex.Money -&gt; RBK Money -&gt; Exchanger -&gt; WebMoney. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Having registered in the RBK Money system, I instantly replenished my account with the necessary amount.  I open my favorite NetExchange exchanger, make a request to transfer from an RBK Money account to a WebMoney wallet.  And ... I see that the translation can not be carried out, because  My wallet has the status ‚ÄúStandard‚Äù, while for withdrawing funds to other payment systems you need to have an ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù wallet. <br><br>  Okay, I thought.  Let's get an Advanced status.  Honestly fill in all the required fields, send the form and see that the time for consideration of my request is 2-5 days (with the days not calendar, but working).  And a money transfer needs to be done literally here and now ... <br><br>  ‚ÄúOkay, and it‚Äôs not through this,‚Äù I thought again.  The transfer was not made on time, and the n-th sum of money remained hanging on the RBK Money account. <br><br>  It was decided to contact the support service in order to get their money back as soon as possible.  Having logged on the RBK Money website in the Help section, I saw the following: <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <i>We apologize, for technical reasons, the telephone line 648-68-58 is temporarily unavailable.</i> <br><br>  Therefore, only email and online chat are available. <br><br>  After writing an email to the support service and explaining the whole situation from the very beginning in detail, the answer was received: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúWe transferred to the security department that you applied to raise the level of your wallet.</i>  <i>Within 24 hours, your application will be considered, but we have no right to guarantee this.</i>  <i>The answer will be sent to the e-mail. "</i> <br><br>  Day passed.  Naturally, no response was received ... <br><br>  We go to the online chat on the website of the payment system.  I go into the chat, with me, the operator Elena allegedly makes contact.  Having received a standard message in the spirit of ‚ÄúGood afternoon, how can I help?‚Äù, I again described the whole situation in detail.  15 minutes of waiting, 30 minutes of waiting, 60 minutes of waiting ... There is no answer from Elena's ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù operator ... <br><br>  Having spat on everything, I came out of the chat, having previously tried to send my ‚Äúdialogue‚Äù with the operator to my e-mail (of course, nothing came of it) ... <br><br>  At the moment, the situation has not changed ... Money in the account of RBK Money, the wallet is still standard, the support service is silent ... <br><br>  This post is just a show of feelings and indignation, so the fate of it is always to be on a personal blog ... And this system, which is <i>‚Äúmore convenient than payments through self-service terminals, your RBK Money e-wallet will be accessible from a computer or mobile phone‚Äù</i> be on my blacklist ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83791/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83791/</a></p>
