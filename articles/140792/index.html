  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Innovative service: we start a startup</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Have a great idea!  You have become a happy owner of the brains that have come up with a completely new, not developed by anyone service that will conquer the Internet like twitter or facebook.  However, there are, what is called, two big differences between the innovative service and a successful startup.  To run any unknown garbage should be with the application of all the intellectual power of the organism and beyond its physical strength. <br><br>  Actually, what and how to run, so as not to go broke and not to fail? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  The starting version does not tolerate excess tails </h5><br>  There is a strong temptation for the demiurge to hang around his main idea, perfect as an egg, with all kinds of chips.  The reality is that half the audience‚Äôs chips are not understandable and too lazy to understand, and the other half are used to doing the same thing differently and not retraining. <br><br>  Save the budget!  Deliver to the hosting and court audience strictly service, straightforward to squareness.  This way you will save money on initial development and support, understand the audience‚Äôs reaction to the product, without distracting to side effects, and your chips will be scheduled for the year ahead.  Not to mention that the audience itself will tell you what it is so lacking about, which you could not have suspected at the planning stage.

    <h5>  Pre-registration page - free and severe </h5><br>  Approximately at the stage of barely working alpha for testing in a narrow circle, a promotional page should be thrown into the network.  It is necessary to put all your design and design talents on it in order to briefly, interesting and enticingly explain why you need something that will be here in time. <br><br>  With a control shot, attach ‚Äúa unique super bonus of fate‚Äù to the description, which will go only to those who pre-register on the page, subscribe to the announcement of the opening and connect to the social network. <br><br>  Here you should post links to an unrealistically active, interesting and useful Twitter account of the service.  And then it's time to rush into the pool of social media with a link and advertising through groups and publics. <br><br><h5>  Effect of the presence in sotsatey </h5><br>  Unreal many services were bent on the pre-registration page stage.  The audience gathered, prepared, and the main BOOM did not happen, after a couple of weeks most of the signatories forgot, what they signed up for and the opening letter flew into spam, and the user never received his bonus. <br><br>  Therefore, it is important to have alpha at the stage of the pre-registration page.  To be sure that the beta is already at hand.  And it is also important to have the same twitter, or a blog or group in contact or all taken together.  That the interested user constantly saw reminders: we work!  It is debugged, it is tested, is about to happen.  And finally: ‚Äúcheck your mail and use open service!‚Äù <br><br>  Well, the opening later than a month to plan is simply pointless. <br><br><h5>  Everything is free </h5><br>  Yes, you dream of getting a lot of money through monetization right now.  But we must endure.  All the basic and slightly more functional should be free and comfortable, while the core of the audience still sits unevenly in its seats in the auditorium and has not become attached to them as a fifth point.  But how it becomes clear that the main audience tasted candy, it's time to introduce banner banners, advanced accounts and other nice cash items. <br><br><h5>  Spot bombardment advertising </h5><br>  It is clear that the service, which has never been before, needs SEO as far as.  People do not know what they need, what they can look for, and they don‚Äôt know how to do it either.  You can invest minimally in advertising of a working service if you choose the right application of forces.  And where to put them: <br><br>  1. A huge part of the daily media and some of the specialized ones are ready to post your article about the service for free if it is not a direct advertisement, but an interesting occasion for them. <br><br>  2. A detailed analysis of the audience of a potential consumer can tell where your user grazes: on Mtv, on Beacon Radio or on a blog of a popular person.  And so there is one piece of advertising budget.  In thematic programs of some channels you can also drive on the informational occasion. <br><br>  3. Social networks should work like slaves in galleys.  Give bonuses for likes, stimulate them with reminders in the right places, lead twitter, participate in conversations in LiveJournal, so that no one can forget about you. <br><br>  4. Well, articles on Habr and Wikipedia should not be ignored.  Write talented and will be rewarded to you! <br><br>  And remember, the slower you work, the faster your competitors grow. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140792/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140792/</a></p>
