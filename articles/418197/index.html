Processes.  Memory is something that happens simultaneously with the process.  Thus, if you are not in this process, you cannot access its memory.  Virtual memory perfectly enhances this isolation for us.  In addition, the debugging mechanism allows you to stick into the memory of another process if you have the same user ID.

      Next we have the network.  Networks in <b>Unix</b> do not quite correspond to the model described above, partly due to the fact that the <b>Unix</b> operating system was first developed and then the network appeared, which soon became popular.  It has a slightly different set of rules.  Therefore, the operations that we really need to take care of are connecting someone to the network if you control the network, or listening to a port if you act as a server.  You may need to read or write data on this connection or send and receive <b>raw</b> packets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dw/gn/zv/dwgnzva6txwuj_esllvdnx3uexg.jpeg"><br><br>  Thus, networks in <b>Unix</b> are largely unrelated to the <b>userid</b> .  The rules are that anyone can always connect to any machine or any IP address or open a connection.  If you want to listen on a port, in this case there is one difference, which is that most users are not allowed to listen on ports with a number below the ‚Äúmagic value‚Äù 1024. In principle, you can listen on such ports, but in this case you should be a special user called <b>‚Äúsuper user‚Äù</b> with <b>uid = 0</b> . <br><br>  And in general, in Unix there is the concept of an administrator, or superuser, which is represented by the identifier uid = 0, which can bypass almost all these checks, so if you work with root rights, you can read and write files, change access rights to them.  The operating system will allow you to do this because it thinks you should have all the privileges.  And such privileges you really need to listen to ports with the number &lt;1024. What do you think about this strange restriction? <br><br>  <b>Audience:</b> it defines specific port numbers for specific connections, for example, for <b>http</b> on port 80. <br><br>  <b>Professor:</b> yes, the default <b>HTTP protocol</b> uses port 80. On the other hand, other services can use ports with a number above 1024, why do we need this restriction?  What is the use? <br><br>  <b>Audience:</b> because you do not want someone to accidentally listen on your <b>HTTP</b> . <br><br>  <b>Professor:</b> yes.  I think the reason for this is that you used to have many users on the same machine.  They logged in with their usernames, launched their applications, so you wanted to make sure that some random user, logging into the computer, would not be able to get hold of the web server running on it.  Because external users do not know who is working on this port, and they simply connect to port 80. If I want to log into this machine and start my own web server, then I will simply transfer all web server traffic to this car.  This is probably not a very good plan, but it is a way that the Unix network subsystem does not allow random users to control well-known services running on these low port numbers.  That is the rationale for such a restriction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ba/0o/qn/ba0oqn2qgabud4-_hmizsks086s.jpeg"><br><br>  In addition, in terms of reading and writing connection data, if you have a descriptor file for a particular socket, <b>Unix</b> will allow you to read and write any data on this <b>TCP</b> or <b>uTP connection</b> .  <b>Unix</b> behaves paranoid about sending <b>raw</b> <b>Unix</b> packets, so it will not allow you to send random packets over the network.  This should be inside the context of a special connection, except when you have <b>root</b> rights and you can do whatever you want. <br><br>  So, one interesting question that you could ask is - where do all these <b>userids</b> come from? <br><br>  We are talking about processes that have a <b>userid</b> or <b>groupid</b> .  When you run <b>PS</b> on your computer, you will definitely see a series of processes with different <b>uid</b> values.  Where did they come from? <br><br>  We need some kind of mechanism to load all these <b>userid</b> values.  In <b>Unix,</b> there are several system calls for this.  Therefore, for the initial loading of these identifier values, there is a function called <b>setuid (uid)</b> , so you can assign the <b>uid</b> number of some current process to this value.  In fact, this is a dangerous operation, like everything else in the <b>Unix</b> tradition, because you can do this only if your <b>uid = 0</b> .  In any case, it should be so. <br><br>  Thus, if you are a root user and have <b>uid = 0</b> , then you can call <b>setuid (uid)</b> and switch the user to any process.  There are a couple of other similar system calls for initializing <b>gid</b> related to the process: these are <b>setgid</b> and <b>setgroups</b> .  Therefore, these system calls allow you to configure the privileges of the process. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qs/6m/bk/qs6mbkc520bn-n_vlpznivx1z0q.jpeg"><br><br>  The fact that your processes get the right access rights when you log into the system on a <b>Unix</b> machine does not happen because you have the same <b>ID</b> as the processes, because the system still does not know who you are.  Instead, <b>Unix</b> has some sort of logon procedure when the <b>SSH</b> secure shell <b>protocol</b> starts the process for anyone who connects to the computer and tries to authenticate the user. <br><br>  Thus, initially, this login process starts with <b>uid = 0</b> as a user with root-rights, and then, when he receives a specific username and password, he checks them in his own database of accounts.  As a rule, in <b>Unix</b> this data is stored in two files: <b>/ etc / password</b> (for historical reasons, passwords are no longer stored in this file), and in the file <b>/ etc / shadow</b> , in which passwords are stored.  However, there is a table in the <b>/ etc / password</b> file that displays each user name in the system as an integer value. <br><br>  Thus, your username is matched to a specific integer in this <b>/ etc / password</b> file, and then the login process checks if your password is correct according to this file.  If it finds your integer <b>uid</b> , then it sets the <b>setuid</b> function to the value of the <b>uid</b> and starts the shell <b>using the exec</b> command <b>(/ bin / sh)</b> .  You can now interact with the shell, but it works under your <b>uid</b> , so you cannot accidentally damage this machine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oa/vi/t8/oavit8bjjn_skjz8-n1k5dhc6co.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Audience:</b> Is it possible to start a new process with <b>uid = 0</b> , if your <b>uid is</b> in fact not equal to 0? <br><br>  <b>Professor:</b> if you have root-rights, you can limit yourself to another <b>uid</b> , lower your privileges, but in any case you can create a process only with the same <b>uid</b> as yours.  But it happens that for various reasons you want to increase your privileges.  Suppose you need to install a package, for which you will need <b>root</b> privileges. <br><br>  In <b>Unix,</b> there are two ways to set privileges.  One we have already mentioned, this is a file descriptor.  So if you really want to increase your privileges, you can talk to someone who works under root-rights and ask them to open this file for you.  Or you need to install some kind of new interface, then this helper opens the file for you and returns you the file descriptor using the <b>fd</b> transfer.  This is one way to increase your privileges, but this is inconvenient, because in some cases there are processes running with a lot of privileges.  For this, <b>Unix</b> has a clever, but at the same time, problem mechanism called <b>"setuid binaries"</b> .  This mechanism is a regular executable file in the <b>Unix</b> file system, except when you run <b>exec</b> on a binary <b>setuid</b> file, for example, <b>/ bin / su</b> on most machines, or <b>sudo</b> . <br><br>  In a typical <b>Unix</b> system <b>,</b> there are a bunch of <b>setuid</b> binaries.  The difference is that when you execute one of these binaries, it actually switches the <b>userid</b> process to the owner of this binary file.  This mechanism seems strange when you first see it.  As a rule, the ways to use it are that this ‚Äúbinary‚Äù most likely has an owner <b>uid of</b> 0, because you really want to restore many privileges. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zt/s5/8d/zts58db83nchnbo1a6qqobpbpuw.jpeg"><br><br>  You want to restore the root permissions so that you can run this <b>su</b> command, and the kernel, when you execute this binary file, switches the <b>uid of the</b> process to 0, so this program will now do some privileged things. <br><br>  <b>Audience:</b> if you have <b>uid = 0</b> , and you change the <b>uid of</b> all these <b>setuid</b> binaries to something not equal to 0, can you recover your privileges? <br><br>  <b>Professor:</b> no, many processes will not be able to restore privileges when access levels are lowered, so you may be stuck in this place.  This mechanism is not bound to <b>uid = 0</b> .  Like any user of a <b>Unix</b> system, you can create any binary file, build a program, compile it, and set this <b>setuid</b> bit in the program itself.  It belongs to you, the user, your user ID.  And this means that anyone who runs your program will run this code with your user ID.  Is there any problem with this?  What should be done? <br><br>  <b>Audience:</b> that is, if there was an error in your application, someone could do anything with it, acting with your privileges? <br><br>  <b>Professor:</b> that's right, it happens if my application is ‚Äúbuggy‚Äù, or if it allows you to run whatever you want.  Suppose I could copy the system shell and make it <b>setuid</b> for me, but then anyone can run this shell under my account.  This is probably not the best course of action.  But such a mechanism does not create problems, because the only person who can set the <b>setuid</b> bit on a binary file is the owner of this file.  You, as the owner of the file, have the <b>uid</b> privilege, so you can transfer your account to another person, but this other person will not be able to create a binary <b>setuid</b> file with your <b>userid</b> . <br><br>  This setuid bit is stored next to these permission bits, that is, in each <b>inode</b> there is also the <b>setuid</b> bit, which says whether the executable file should or if this program has switched to the owner's <b>uid</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4d/o0/cf/4do0cfauri7y6g94omunnrdyv14.jpeg"><br><br>  It turns out that this is a very tricky mechanism when used properly, and thanks to it the kernel implements the program correctly.  In fact, this is fairly easy to do, because only one check is performed: if this <b>setuid</b> bit exists, then the process switches to <b>uid</b> .  It is quite simple. <br><br>  But it's safe to use it safely, because, as it was just stated, if this program contains errors or does something unexpected, then you get the ability to do arbitrary things under <b>uid = 0</b> or under any other <b>uid</b> .  In <b>Unix,</b> when you run a program, you inherit a lot of things from your parent process. <br><br>  For example, you can pass environment variables to <b>setuid</b> binary files.  The fact is that in <b>Unix</b> you can specify which shared library should be used for the process by setting the environment variable, and the <b>setuid</b> binaries do not care about filtering these environment variables. <br><br>  For example, you can run <b>bin / su</b> , but use the shared libraries for the <b>printf</b> function, so your <b>printf</b> will start when <b>bin / su</b> prints something and you can run the shell instead of running <b>printf</b> . <br><br>  There are many subtleties that you must understand correctly regarding the program‚Äôs distrust of the data that the user enters.  Since you usually trust user input, the <b>setuid</b> mechanism has never been the safest part of an entire <b>Unix</b> system.  Any questions about this? <br><br>  <b>Audience:</b> does <b>setuid</b> also apply to groups or only to a user? <br><br>  <b>Professor:</b> there is a <b>setgid</b> bit, a symmetrical <b>setuid</b> bit, which you can also set.  If the file has a specific <b>gid</b> and this <b>setgid</b> bit is set when the program starts, then you will get it. <br><br>  <b>Setgid is</b> not particularly used, but can be useful in cases where you want to provide very specific privileges.  For example, <b>bin / su</b> probably requires a lot of privileges, but there may be some program that needs some additional privileges, for example, to write something in a special log file.  Therefore, you probably want to give it a certain group and create for it a log file that can be written by this group.  So even if the program is "buggy", then you will not lose anything except this group.  This is useful as a mechanism, which for some reason is not used too often, because, after all, people should use more root-rights. <br><br>  <b>Audience:</b> Are there restrictions on who can change access? <br><br>  <b>Professor:</b> yes.  Different <b>Unix</b> implementations have different checks for this.  The general rule is that only root can change the owner of the file, because you do not want to create files that will belong to someone else, and you certainly don‚Äôt want to appropriate other people's files.  Therefore, if your <b>uid is</b> not 0, then you are stuck.  You cannot change the ownership of any file.  If your <b>uid = 0</b> , you have root-rights and you can change the owner to anyone.  There are some complications, if you have a binary <b>setuid</b> and you switch from one <b>uid</b> to another, this is pretty tricky, but basically you basically can‚Äôt change the owner of the file if you don‚Äôt have root privileges. <br><br>  By all accounts, this is a bit outdated system.  You could probably imagine a lot of ways that simplify the processes described above, but in fact, most advanced systems look like this because they evolve over time.  But you can perfectly use these mechanisms as a sandbox. <br><br>  It's just a kind of basic <b>Unix</b> principles that appear in almost every Unix-like operating system: <b>Mac OS X</b> , <b>Linux</b> , <b>FreeBSD</b> , <b>Solaris</b> , if someone else uses it, and so on.  But in each of these systems there are more complex mechanisms that you could use.  For example, in <b>Linux</b> there is a sandbox <b>set COMP</b> , <b>Mac OS X</b> uses the sandbox <b>Seatbelt</b> .  Next week, I will give you examples of sandboxes available in each <b>Unix</b> based system. <br><br>  So one of the last mechanisms we‚Äôll look at before diving into <b>OKWS</b> explains how you need to deal with the <b>setuid</b> binaries and shows how you can protect yourself from existing security holes.  The problem is that you will inevitably have some <b>setuid</b> binaries on your system, such as <b>/ bin / su</b> , or <b>sudo</b> , or something else, and it is likely that there will be errors in your programs.  Because of this, someone will be able to execute the binary <b>setuid</b> file and the process will be able to gain <b>root</b> access, which you don‚Äôt want to allow. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gy/nt/aa/gyntaadl0kgyfcku6ncq8v334kg.jpeg"><br><br>  The <b>Unix</b> mechanism, which is often used to prevent a potentially malicious process from running using <b>setuid</b> binaries, is to use the file system namespace to modify it using the <b>chroot</b> system call, the root directory change operation.  <b>OKWS</b> , being a web server specializing in creating fast and secure web services, uses it quite widely. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m3/x1/xr/m3x1xrg_tmht2b2l8rwd8kzzy7s.jpeg"><br><br>  So, in <b>Unix,</b> you can <b>chroot</b> in a specific directory, so maybe you can <b>chroot ("/ foo")</b> . <br><br>  There are 2 explanations for what <b>chroot</b> does.  The first one is just intuitive, it means that after running <b>chroot</b> , the root directory or the directory located after the slash is basically equivalent to what <b>/ foo used</b> before you called the <b>chroot</b> .  This looks like a namespace constraint below your <b>/ foo</b> .  Therefore, if you have a file that used to be called <b>/ foo / x</b> , then after calling the <b>chroot</b> you can get this file by simply opening <b>/ x</b> .  So just limit your namespace to a subdirectory.  This is what is the intuitive version. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2w/58/wf/2w58wflgecku62k-urraxwggxcc.jpeg"><br><br>  Of course, not the intuitive version is important in security, but what exactly does the kernel do with this system call?  And it does mostly two things.  First, it changes the value of this slash, so whenever you access or when you start a directory name with a slash, the kernel includes any file that you have provided <b>chroot</b> operations.  In our example, this is the file <b>/ foo</b> before you call the <b>chroot</b> , that is, we get that <b>/ = / foo</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gn/yx/-t/gnyx-tksd5brn4avys0dhppaw6c.jpeg"><br><br>  The next thing the kernel tries to do is to protect you from being able to ‚Äúescape‚Äù from your <b>/</b> if you do <b>/../</b> .  Because in <b>Unix,</b> I could ask you, for example, to give me, for example, <b>/../etc/password</b> .  So if I just added this line like this: <b>/foo/../etc/password</b> , this would not be good, because I could just exit <b>/ foo</b> and go to getting <b>/ etc / password</b> . <br><br>  The second thing the kernel does with a <b>Unix</b> system call is that when you call a <b>chroot</b> for this particular process, it changes the way you evaluate <b>/../</b> in this directory.  Therefore, it modifies <b>/../</b> so that <b>/ foo</b> points to itself.  Thus, it does not allow you to "make an escape", and this change only applies to this process and does not affect the rest.  What are your ideas on how to ‚Äúescape‚Äù from the <b>chroot</b> environment using the way it is implemented? <br><br>  Interestingly, the kernel tracks only one <b>chroot</b> directory, so perhaps you could perform the <b>chroot = (/ foo)</b> operation, but you would be glued to this location.  So you want to get <b>/ etc / password</b> , but how to do it?  You can open the root directory right now by typing <b>open (* / *)</b> .  This will give you a file descriptor describing what <b>/ foo is</b> .
