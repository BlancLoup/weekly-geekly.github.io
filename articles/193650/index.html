  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to buy a 3D printer in China, or Toy for $ 1000</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Greetings, Habr.  My name is Igor, I am a sales manager, and I am the first to open a series of posts about interesting purchases through our store.  This review will focus on the 3D printer I purchased, or, to be precise, on the selection process itself. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2eb/8ef/d42/2eb8efd422d2f4faa4d5a446095b3d78.png" align="right"><br>  In general, on the one hand, 3D printing is always of interest, on the other hand, it can hardly be called a mass phenomenon.  There are several reasons: <br><br>  1) The <u>high price of the device itself.</u> <br>  At least you give $ 300, for quite a decent unit from $ 1000, not counting the delivery. <br><br>  2) A <u>decent cost of consumables</u> <br>  If you need paper for printing on a regular printer, the 3d printer prefers plastic at a price of $ 20-30 per kilogram

      3) <u>Lack of understanding why it is needed at all</u> <br>  This is the main reason.  The first two rather layered on her, "closing the topic." <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Flour choice </h4><br>  In my case, with the third item, everything was simple - I purchased the printer as a gift to my brother, knowing exactly what he needed and would be used. <br>  What did the purchase process look like?  For a start, I decided on the amount, i.e.  with my own possibilities: for the purchase + delivery I laid 50,000 rubles.  and not a cent more.  In this price range, I danced, looking for a better option, oddly enough, in China.  Why China?  Because a significant part of the producers is there, as well as because I work in an intermediary company from China, it would be a sin not to use this. <br><br>  Honestly, at the beginning of my search I did not even imagine the scale of the disaster.  I was sure that, since there is not much demand, then there will not be many manufacturing companies (and even more models).  In general, this turned out to be a delusion, there were a lot of options, and this fact would greatly lengthen the time of my searches, if it were not for the help of a friend who (unlike me) came across these devices and even had one at home. <br><br>  I will say right away that I immediately cut off the suggested options for ‚Äúassemble the printer with your own hands‚Äù, since  quite self-critical in questions from where my hands grow, and the chances of losing (not cheap, by the way) details from the fact that they did not fit well with each other repulsed any interest in such experiments.  Therefore, after three evenings of discussions and several bottles of reds, along with the very familiar one, our joint choice fell on these models, among which I had to choose myself: <br><br>  <b>Cube</b> (not to be confused with the next Cube X series) <br>  <b>FlashForge 3D Printer - Creator</b> <br>  <b>ReplicatorG</b> <br>  <b>The mbot cube</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f77/497/49a/f7749749a628443a97d64bfcf45a9d7f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I'll return to the most burning factor (price) at the end, because  they all (more or less) met my criteria.  Here is what I compared first: <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/512/90f/2fe/51290f2feeeb25f26b25aae4e125417e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><br>  The first dropout was the easiest.  Although it was not very clear how critical the choice of print is for a brother (in one or two colors), but I thought that if there was such an opportunity, and the price almost did not change - why refuse?  At this stage, Cube was eliminated (and the size of the model was its smallest). <br><br>  Then it was already more difficult: FlashForge lost in the size of the model at the exit (in width), but in terms of height it overtook all the rest.  ReplicatorG is also inferior in print accuracy.  Here I had no doubt (because the software of each of the printers allows you to set fairly accurate TTX) - the more accurate the form, the less then you have to work with the sandpaper and, thus, I sift out and ReplicatorG. <br><br><h4>  Price issue </h4><br>  The fiercest struggle began between the two remaining - they were almost like twin brothers (taking into account my demands), but, nevertheless, mercantile spirit won. <br><br>  FlashForge though costs $ 10 more, but at the expense of weight (15 kg against 18) it turned out to be cheaper in delivery for 3000 r.  I chose the delivery itself by EMS, so she flew a pretty penny - 14900r, and if I took the Post of Russia, I would give about 6000r for delivery. <br>  The final cost price + shipping: 48000r, if rounded <br><br>  Before ordering, just in case, I looked at FlashForge in Moscow stores, unfortunately, as expected, the minimum price was 62000r (on request).  And the more common The MBot Cube some shops offered to purchase as much as almost 75,000 rubles, but there were also more modest offers - only for 60000 rubles (though not in Moscow, but in Kazan, but it seems like taking into account the delivery to Moscow). <br><br><h4>  Buying process </h4><br>  I ordered, of course, through our system, although there are no indulgences for the workers (well, except perhaps the ability to personally control everything).  All orders still go through the site.  The process of buying from us is simple: <br><br>  ¬∑ Find on the website what is required, in my case - a 3D printer; <br>  ¬∑ Deposit the required amount to the account in your personal account (I did it in advance, but you can in the process); <br>  ¬∑ Indicate the required number of items, I understandably took 1 pc; <br>  ¬∑ Indicate your details for the delivery of goods; <br>  ¬∑ Confirm payment <br><br>  Then my order, like any other application, went to the system, and here I have already taken advantage of the privileges of the employee.  They consist in the fact that it is possible to get our workers in China.  What I did, since the departure for my purchase: calling on Skype and a thousand times asking to send more!  More!  More! 11 photos, still potestit, check everything for the hundredth time and so;) In general, it was a headache for our entire Chinese office, until the printer reached me (and it went for 13 days). <br><br>  The brother appreciated the gift, which is important, and immediately let it go.  As I understood from his reviews, the printer works normally, stably, does not require dancing with a tambourine.  So the model turned out to be really good, I can safely recommend it :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/193650/">https://habr.com/ru/post/193650/</a></p>
