Who said it would buy?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Greetings to all! <br>  We continue to write a business plan <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/arbeit/105971/">Article 1. Start</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/arbeit/106498/">Article 2. Description of the business</a> <br><br>  The topic of this article is what you sell. <br><h4>  What do we sell? </h4><br>  As you remember, I often recommend that you ask yourself more questions.  Today is no exception. <br>  So which question is the best on your product?  ‚ÄúWhat is our product or service?‚Äù No. <br>  We need to ask ourselves the following question: <b>‚ÄúWhat are we selling?‚Äù</b> .  It would seem that there is no difference.  But no, there is. <br>  Let's take a closer look: for example, you think that you sell hammers, nails, paint, wallpaper, laminate.  However, customers do not buy it from you.  Customers buy an improved interior of the house, solving small problems in the household, and so on.  Notice the difference?  To think about your product better level up, tracing its complex goals.  So it will be easier to position and sell. <br>  The above approach will allow you to set clearer goals.  In the example above, the goal is to provide the possibility of repair and improvement of living conditions for clients.  The guys from 37Signals are not selling the Basecamp program for project managers, but the ability for teams to jointly manage projects and meet deadlines.

    <h4>  Why will it buy? </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/bb2/4bb/a44/bb24bba44b6bc3ab74dd4eb4a6f09e82.jpg" alt="image"><br>  * translation "Your mother is an inappropriate market to test." <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Who told you that your product will be bought?  Do you have confirmation from at least 10 people that they will buy (they would not buy, <b>would</b> not like) what you are selling? <br>  Or do you think that you know better than customers what they want? <br>  Or are you just afraid to go out with your <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/arbeit/106498/">elevator pitch</a> and interview a few dozen people?  Are you afraid of failure?  You have polished your business plan, idea, business model, and you can‚Äôt get out of fear for disappointment?  So, you have no choice.  The sooner customers see your product, the sooner you will come across a reality, which, as a rule, has little to do with what you have written and shown on beautiful PowerPoint diagrams. <br>  Several times it happened to me that the idea, which seemed brilliant and with which I ran to search for the team, provoked a reaction in the form of round eyes and teasing about the name.  Not to say that I abandoned those ideas, but the reaction of the people was sobering. <br><br><h4>  A bit of philosophy (you can skip this part) </h4><br>  Your product will be bought only in one case: if it meets the market needs, expectations and desires.  Based on this, you have two ways - either to form desires and expectations in people, or follow trends. <br>  The first path is risky, but the winner takes it all.  So it was with Facebook, Twitter and so on.  Also, the first path is easier for large corporations with resources. <br>  The second way is following the trends.  And here the principle ‚ÄúThe entrepreneur is the one who benefits from eliminating the imbalance in the economy‚Äù (Schumpeter).  It is necessary to soberly assess the needs and expectations of the market. <br>  <i>Example: "A Belgian furniture store, advertises and sells" a furniture package only for divorced men. "</i>  <i>It is known that 50% of marriages end in divorce for 5 years.</i>  <i>Aware of the hatred of the shops of most men, they created the so-called ‚Äúpackage offer‚Äù.</i>  <i>For example: living room, bedroom, kitchen, TV and DVD player for $ 2,700.</i>  <i>Every week they sell 10 or more such packages. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><h4>  This is real? </h4><br>  Is your product real?  Are you able to enter the market with him?  And in a <b>short time</b> ?  In the product description, you must clearly and clearly show that your product is real. It must enter the market as early as possible.  In this, I absolutely agree with the philosophy of Getting real (a good book, I recommend reading), which say that the sooner you enter the market with what you have, the greater the chance of success.  This strategy has several advantages: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ You show your <b>ability to implement</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ You immediately <b>see the reaction of customers</b> and are no longer wondering what will be successful and what will not. <br>  ‚Ä¢ You keep a <b>psychological boost for the team</b> - the more often you go out with something new, the more sense of action <br>  ‚Ä¢ You show customers that you are alive and working. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Avoid the process of ‚Äúpolishing‚Äù the product.  It is impossible to please everyone and everything. <br>  ‚Ä¢ You increase your chances of getting financing from investors. <br>  ‚Ä¢ You start getting feedback and recommendations from customers. <br><br>  <b>In fact, in this part of the business plan, the most important thing is to show:</b> <b><br></b>  <b>‚Ä¢ That your product is real</b> <b><br></b>  <b>‚Ä¢ that your product will be in demand</b> <br><br>  Everything.  Nothing more is needed.  The ideal part of a start-up business plan for a product may include just a couple of suggestions: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúOur product X agreed to buy 20 people + we plan to receive confirmation from several dozens more.</i>  <i>We plan to enter the market in a month, since we have Y and Z. ‚Äù</i> <br>  Everything.  No need for schedules, focus groups, arguments about the usefulness of the product and other things. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108848/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108848/</a></p>
