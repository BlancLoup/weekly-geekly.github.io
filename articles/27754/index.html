  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Search for persons or on the road to singularity.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On one of the drunks, a thought struck me - there is an unoccupied niche on the search market.  Despite the abundance of both highly specialized and highly specialized search engines on the Internet, I don‚Äôt know one that would target people to search.  Often, knowing ICQ person, you can determine a lot - up to the address.  It is worth only somewhere to find the name.  The problem is that now you have to do it manually - there is not a single automated service. <br><br>  If someone got around to make such a search engine, it would at least be interesting.  And given the development of various microformats - also promising.  I am sure that in the near future such services will appear in public use.  <i>And the fact that closed development for searching people on the Internet already exists now - I am absolutely sure.</i>  In particular, there are many legends around the buzz - with their volumes of personal information, they can afford to make a personal characteristic for each of their users.  Why don‚Äôt they develop people search? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In theory, every Internet user leaves a trace of himself - letters, search history, posts, purchases, comments.  Little of this is encrypted so that the possibility of interception of information is excluded completely.  Yes, and there is no point in this.  Paranoia is still considered a manifestation of mental pain :) <br><br>  In general, it seems to me reasonable to quickly obtain complete (up to his skeletons in the closet) information about a person.  I see a few positive moments in this development of the Internet - in the first place, people will become much more open and healthier.  They will no longer hide their terrible secrets, but it will also become much easier to relate to these secrets - who among us is not without sin?  Surely talking drunk will look like something like this:

But now, having a similar set of merits, people simply keep silent about them - so the difference is not great. <br><br>  Perhaps the creators of such services all as one will be prudent and do not lay out their development in the network.  Although remembering the history of gunpowder, which ultimately was invented and changed the world, I would not hope for a similar outcome.  The maximum that can be expected is another 30 years of quiet life.  And then the massive fun begins.  Perhaps it coincides in time with the singularity, which would also be nice. <br><br>  So good luck to us all.  While we live as we lived.  But do not forget preparing for an era of change.  To singularity :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27754/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27754/</a></p>
