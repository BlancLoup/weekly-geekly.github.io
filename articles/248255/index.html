From December 8 to December 21, 2014, the fourth measurement of the ratio of positive and negative emotions in public messages of Russian social media users was carried out.  The main conclusion is that despite the difficult political and economic situation, the <b>positive dynamic of the general emotional background remains in the country</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a07/aa2/feb/a07aa2febd994c66b96e5d7ac65ff8f4.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  As in <a href="http://br-analytics.ru/blog/%3Fp%3D1489">previous</a> studies, <b>Russian-language references to ‚Äúlove‚Äù and ‚Äúhatred‚Äù from the first person were analyzed</b> : positive emotions (for example, <b>‚ÄúI love‚Äù, ‚ÄúI love‚Äù</b> , etc.) and negative ( <b>‚ÄúI hate‚Äù, ‚Äúannoys me "</b> And so on.).  To determine the messages that meet the above criteria, for the specified period of time, <b>528 million Russian-language messages from 35 million authors</b> from popular social networks were analyzed: VKontakte, Facebook, Twitter, LiveJournal, Instagram, etc.

      During the study period, positive and negative emotions were <b>cumulatively mentioned in 5.2 million messages</b> , of which <b>81.8% messages were about love</b> and only <b>18.2% were about hatred</b> .  Compared to the May data, the number of messages about <b>love increased by 2.8%</b> . <br><br>  For each subject of the Russian Federation, the ‚ÄúLove Index‚Äù * was calculated, based on which regions of the most positive and negative can be identified.  It is important to note that according to the measurement results, all regions of Russia have positive indices greater than 1, i.e.  positive messages more than negative. <br><br>  <b>Leading regions:</b> <br><br>  <b>Leadership in the Love Index in December was won by the Republic of Khakassia</b> , the Love Index of which was 5.4, which made it possible to rise to the first line from 9th place in the May rating.  <b>Kostroma region and the Republic of Altai with indices equal to 5.4</b> , divided the <b>second and third lines of the</b> rating.  <b>The fourth place and the fifth place are the Republic of Kalmykia and the Vladimir region</b> , with indices 5.2. <br><br>  <b>Regions with the lowest ‚ÄúLove Index‚Äù value:</b> <br><br>  <b>The smallest positive value</b> , as before, was recorded in the <b>Republic of Ingushetia - the index was 3.0</b> , the republic remained at the last, <b>85th place.</b>  <b>84 line</b> ranking - the <b>Republic of Dagestan with an index of 3.0, 83 place - Sakha - 3.2, 82 - the Chechen Republic - 3.2, and 81 - Kabardino-Balkaria - 3.3.</b> <br><br>  <b>Dynamics</b> <br><br>  The growth of the Love Index, despite the low positions in the ranking, was shown by <b>all</b> outsider regions of the previous study.  Perhaps it is in these regions that there remains a ‚Äúreserve for growth‚Äù of the number of positive emotions, and there is a mood that growth will continue. <br><br>  <b>The largest growth was shown by the Republic of Kalmykia, which rose immediately to 58 lines and took the 4th place in the rating with the index of 5.2.</b>  Such an explosive growth of the Love Index in the region is probably related to the improving social situation occurring after the early change of leadership in the region in September 2014 and the fact that Zul, one of the main and favorite national holidays of the republic, was held in Kalmykia. <br><br>  <b>Sevastopol and the Autonomous Republic of Crimea</b> showed high growth <b>, rising to 19th and 49th places in the ranking</b> , thus the administrative units improved their positions by 28 and 30 points, respectively. <br><br>  <b>The Amur Region</b> , which had not previously dropped below 12th place, and in May, ranked third, lost much of its position, taking only <b>47th place</b> .  Perhaps the mood of the inhabitants of the region was affected by the harsh weather conditions in December - heavy blizzards, snow drifts and a large number of accidents and other emergencies associated with them. <br><br>  Brief summary of the study: the range of values ‚Äã‚Äãof the Love Index in Russia has expanded again towards an increase in the ‚Äúpositive‚Äù maximum, simultaneously with an increase in the minimum value, which may indicate an <b>improvement in the emotional climate in general in all regions of the country</b> . <br><br>  <i>* The index is calculated as the ratio of the number of messages of love to the number of messages of hate.</i> <br><br>  You can get acquainted with the full version of the study and the interactive map ‚ÄúLove Index‚Äù in all regions of Russia <a href="https://br-analytics.ru/blog/%3Fp%3D2172">on the Brand Analytics blog</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/248255/">https://habr.com/ru/post/248255/</a></p>
