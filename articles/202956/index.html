  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Clearance of Tesla electric vehicles increased firmware upgrade</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/091/f1b/735/091f1b7357bd6383505a78a192adab80.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  The future is already quite near - firmware updates ‚Äúover the air‚Äù can be received not only by gadgets. <br><br>  Some insight into what modern high-tech electric cars actually represent are from Elon Musk's blog entry, in which he talks about a number of incidents that happened some time ago in the USA with the Tesla Model S. In short, the story with them is : drivers drove on a certain object on the road (there is an opinion that a piece of body that had fallen off the trailer in one of the cases), which pierced the protective sheets of the battery compartment (it is under the bottom of the car)  ss fire in almost all cases, was not slow to appear on YouTube.  Given that the onboard computer warned about the problem, stopped the car and the burning hood was removed almost by the drivers themselves.  All this, coupled with public opinion, led to the fact that Tesla's shares lost a significant share of the cost due to a potential problem: Tesla S can burn in a collision with metal debris on the road. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The charismatic Elon Musk in response to the public outcry led the statistics that his electric cars are still safer than the gasoline counterparts - almost five times.  More specifically, in the United States, about 400 people died in the third quarter as a result of more than 1,200 serious accidents, while for the entire period of operation of Tesla (and about 19,000 cars drive on the roads of the USA) there were no fatal incidents directly with electric car. <br><br>  Words are words, but Musk says about the practical steps that were taken by his company.  In addition to requesting the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to address all cases thoroughly, all Tesla S models will receive a firmware update in the near future, called ‚Äúairborne‚Äù, which will increase ground clearance. electric vehicle by changing the parameters of the air suspension.  This should theoretically reduce the likelihood of colliding with foreign objects and potentially prevent future incidents similar to those encountered by car owners in the cases described above.  In addition, in January of next year, Tesla S drivers will get more freedom - the new firmware will allow you to fully adjust the height of the suspension at its discretion.

      Another point also deserves attention.  Musk says that the terms of use of Tesla S will be updated so that incidents with electric car fires are covered by the insurance company, even if a fire occurs due to the driver himself.  Thus, it is easy to conclude that the level of confidence in the reliability of their electric vehicles at the head of the company is really very high. <br><br>  [ <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/mission-tesla">Source</a> ] </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/202956/">https://habr.com/ru/post/202956/</a></p>
