And now, when all feedback has already been compiled and analyzed, we can summarize.  Here is the last conference in numbers: <br><br><ul><li>  900+ people, 2 days of reports, 3 streams </li><li>  30 reports, 2 workshops </li><li>  36 speakers </li><li>  3 MC </li><li>  10 lightning talks </li><li>  3 BoF sessions </li><li>  Competition "TCXX" with the support of <a href="https://twitter.com/littledan">Daniel Ehrenberg</a> (ex-chairman of TC39) </li><li>  Premiere of the documentary film about Ember.js </li><li>  Event satellite Node.js Code + Learn (the first of its kind in the history of the CIS) </li></ul><br>  And under the cut - about all this in more detail. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The second time in a row at HolyJS happened sold out, and this time a month before the conference.  Frankly speaking, we ourselves did not expect this.  On the one hand, of course, this is a success: the conference is interesting to more people than we expected.  But on the other hand, some of those who wanted to attend the conference could not get there, but someone could be cramped.

      We want to apologize to those who were uncomfortable, and inform: for the future, we have taken this into account.  <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D457112">The next HolyJS</a> will be held in the autumn at the Moscow WTC Congress Center, where more than 1,000 people easily fit.  And in St. Petersburg we will hold HolyJS in Expoforum, where, if necessary, at least 10,000 will fit. <br><br><h2>  Program </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u-/pv/h5/u-pvh52hbvhphgo9ydtoqtg2s4w.jpeg"><br>  <sup>Ryan dahl</sup> <br><br>  As usual, there were two days and three streams of reports.  Now we already know which reports the audience found interesting - let's take a look at some of them: <br><br><ul><li>  Opened the conference <b>Ryan Dahl</b> (for the youngest readers, we recall that this is the creator of Node.js), told about his new project <a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno">Deno</a> .  We broadcast the reports from YouTube on the first day on YouTube, so it became immediately available <a href="https://youtu.be/YDBE7OM7-mM%3Ft%3D4000">to the</a> whole world <a href="https://youtu.be/YDBE7OM7-mM%3Ft%3D4000">on video</a> - and instead of reading the descriptions, you can just watch for yourself. </li><li>  Almost everyone uses Chrome DevTools, and who would be able to tell about them better than one of their authors, <b>Alex Kozyatinsky</b> ?  This time, Alexey told us how to do cosmic things very simply with the help of the lamest protocol Chrome DevTools (and this also <a href="https://youtu.be/YDBE7OM7-mM%3Ft%3D16895">got</a> into the open broadcast). </li><li>  In addition to the tools (new and generally accepted), we don‚Äôt forget about fundamental things that are sometimes not very often considered in the frontend.  And in such a difficult issue, the wonderful <b>Marina Mironovich</b> helped us with a very interesting report ‚ÄúAlgorithms on graphs‚Äù.  In the open broadcast this was not, but especially for the readers of this post give a link to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DQ61wpfFnYYo">record</a> . </li><li>  This time we had a lot of experiments, including those related to reports.  Two examples of such experimental performances: <br><br>  Wonderful <b>Ilya Klimov</b> told us about ‚ÄúLamp CI / CD: how and where to start,‚Äù here we will also share the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DCwU-OiS_PEQ">video</a> . <br><br>  And for the first time in the history of HolyJS, a person became the owner of the title Java Champion.  <b>Oleg Shelaev</b> presented a report on GraalVM, showing us how to call Java from JS, as well as R, Python and Ruby in one runtime.  ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DsKS4A9I8xb8">video</a> ). <br><br>  Judging by audience estimates, reports that are not directly related to JS, turned out to be successful.  We will continue to experiment and look forward to suggestions in the comments. </li><li>  In addition to those directly related to the development, they also raised an important topic for the frontend community in promoting open-source projects.  <b>Andrei Sitnik</b> told about this (to whom he would talk about such as not the author of several successful projects at once), and his presentation <a href="https://youtu.be/YDBE7OM7-mM%3Ft%3D35600">can also be viewed</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rq/td/qi/rqtdqiyqgcemwudtb7ctklwcuda.jpeg"><br>  <sup>Andrey Sitnik</sup> </li><li>  And there were <a href="https://holyjs-piter.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D457112">many other</a> reports, videos of which will be available later. </li></ul><br><br>  We traditionally prepare ‚Äúspare‚Äù reports in case of emergency replacement, and this time there were also two such speakers who did not speak: <b>Roman Kolesnikov</b> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Farzad_YZ"><b>Farzad YousefZadeh</b></a> (thanks to both of them for their willingness to back up the conference).  But the preparation efforts were not in vain, you can still see the report from Farzad ‚ÄúStatecharts driven UI development‚Äù in the fall at Moscow's HolyJS. <br><br><h2>  Workshops </h2><br>  Perhaps, they became the most difficult experiment on this HolyJS: preparation of the workshop took 5-10 times longer than the report.  There were two workshops (one each day), they lasted for 2-3 hours and went in parallel with the program.  And in this text for the first time we publish links to their videos. <br><br>  On the first day, <b>Stanislav Kurilov</b> talked about how to remove extra code from CSS Modules runtime using a webpack - you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DJ1gHHmABk44">see</a> . <br><br>  And on the second day, <b>Pavel Malyshev</b> conducted a Svelte Cookbook - a Svelte master class.  He began with a greeting from <a href="https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris">Rich Harris</a> : Rich recorded a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DI5DIcbcXzfE%26feature%3Dyoutu.be%26t%3D96">short video</a> specially for visitors to the workshop.  But the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DI5DIcbcXzfE">video of</a> the workshop itself is not ‚Äúsmall‚Äù: it lasts almost three hours. <br><br><h2>  MC </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ar/rx/1k/arrx1klbw6-tj7_m2alkrvb2pnc.jpeg"><br>  <sup>Three MC and Martin Splitt</sup> <br><br>  In addition to the main content part, this time we worked with the presentation of reports.  Again, as an experiment, we had three wonderful MCs: <a href="https://twitter.com/smashingmag">Vitaly Friedman</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/webmaxru">Maxim Salnikov</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/bunopus">Evgeniy Kot</a> .  You can see, for example, what the <a href="https://youtu.be/YDBE7OM7-mM%3Ft%3D3852">beginning of the first day</a> looked like (before the performance by Ryan Dahl).  Many thanks to the guys for the created mood and <a href="https://youtu.be/YDBE7OM7-mM%3Ft%3D7424">interesting QA-sessions</a> . <br><br><h2>  Activities </h2><br>  The <a href="https://github.com/HolyJS-TCXX/HolyJS-Piter-2019-TCXX">TCXX</a> contest for the best proposal to the JS standard has already become traditional.  But there was also something new in it: the former chairman of TC39 <a href="https://twitter.com/littledan">Daniel Ehrenberg</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/mike1pol">Mikhail Poluboyarinov</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/ak_239">Alexey Kozyatinsky</a> , and <a href="https://twitter.com/chicoxyzzy">Sergey Rubanov</a> , who <a href="https://t.me/juliarderity/585">went</a> to the TC39 committee meeting in Berlin a week after the conference, joined us to help in choosing the winner.  By the way, at this meeting many interesting things were approved.  While the main results have not been published, a number of telegram posts can be viewed: <br><br><ol><li>  <a href="https://t.me/juliarderity/618">t.me/juliarderity/618</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://t.me/juliarderity/621">t.me/juliarderity/621</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://t.me/juliarderity/622">t.me/juliarderity/622</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://t.me/juliarderity/623">t.me/juliarderity/623</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://t.me/juliarderity/624">t.me/juliarderity/624</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://t.me/juliarderity/625">t.me/juliarderity/625</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://t.me/juliarderity/626">t.me/juliarderity/626</a> </li></ol><br><br>  And the winner of the TCXX this time was the proposal <a href="https://github.com/HolyJS-TCXX/HolyJS-Piter-2019-TCXX/pull/10/files">String capitalize method</a> from <a href="https://github.com/helenjer">Elena Pravdina</a> .  Colleagues are now helping to find a champion (a colleague who can contribute <a href="https://github.com/HolyJS-TCXX/proposal-to-capitalize-method-for-string-prototype">this propozal</a> to TC39 according to their <a href="https://tc39.es/process-document/">rules</a> ). <br><br>  At the end of the first day there was a party.  Traditional BoF sessions have already taken place: this time it was possible to discuss the current state of affairs in Node.js (with the contributors to this project and with Ryan Dahl), a11y and the culture of communication in international multicultural projects. <br><br>  Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/vaier">Alexey Kanunnikov</a> and our wonderful colleagues from the <a href="https://twitter.com/honeypotio">HoneyPot</a> , in the first hall one could watch the premiere <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D7Ym2ADCn77Q">of the Ember.js</a> documentary dubbed into Russian.  For complete happiness, there wasn‚Äôt enough popcorn. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j1/ai/4p/j1ai4pw_d_hd3oqrzhhob7vrhe8.jpeg"><br><br>  And also at the party you could listen to 10 lightning talks - mini-reports from conference visitors. <br><br><h2>  Code + Learn </h2><br>  I would also like to note that the next day after the conference there <a href="https://twitter.com/mike1pol/status/1132998218483195904">was a</a> great satellite event.  <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/get-involved/code-and-learn/">Node.js Code + Learn</a> is an <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/code-and-learn/issues/95">event</a> where Node.js contributors help make your (albeit very small, but your first) commit in Node.js.  In addition to some of the conference speakers, <a href="https://twitter.com/skovorodan">Nikita Skovoroda</a> assisted him.  And the main role in organizing the event was played by our wonderful friends from <a href="https://twitter.com/gopiterjs">PiterJS</a> . <br><br>  This is the first such event in the CIS, and we assume that not the last. <br><br><h2>  Interview </h2><br>  We had two broadcasts: one - open to the whole world, with the first reports of the first hall, the other - paid with access to all reports of both days.  (By the way, the next Moscow HolyJS will be similar, and the sale of online tickets is already <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/registration/online/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D457112">open</a> .) <br><br>  And in both broadcasts, we filled out the breaks between reports with the help of interviews with speakers and sponsors.  And now we share with you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPL8sJahqnzh8JzRGP3_YWTm109Bd5G2IHu">videos of</a> these interviews for both days. <br><br>  We especially recommend watching two interviews in conjunction: first with <b>Alex Castillo</b> , then with <b>Marina Mironovich</b> . <br><br><h2>  HolyJS 2019 Moscow </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4g/re/bg/4grebg-taz5mspaw-wtzygk_5r0.jpeg"><br>  <sup>That's the size of our expectation of the next meeting.</sup> <br><br>  We have been preparing Moscow HolyJS for three months, which will be held <b>on November 8-9</b> .  The first batch of reports will be published on the site later.  But now you can <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/registration/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D457112">buy tickets</a> , and later they will gradually go up.  And we are <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/callforpapers/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D457112">accepting</a> applications for reports with might and main - if you want to speak, now is the right time to let us know! <br><br>  And finally - a special thanks to several other people: <a href="https://twitter.com/cakeinpanic">Ekaterina Pavlenko</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/_bmsdave">Vadim Gorbachev</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/kirjs">Kirill Cherkashin</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mike1pol">Mikhail Poluboyarinov</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/457112/">https://habr.com/ru/post/457112/</a></p>
