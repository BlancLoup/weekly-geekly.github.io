  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How are designers worse than musicians?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/793/33a/3e2/79333a3e20ea6d1105cc385d79354092.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Not so long ago I had the opportunity to attend a regular round table on the problems of collective management organizations (CMOs).  These organizations (if anyone does not know) are mainly engaged in collecting money from cafe-bars-restaurants for music played there, and distribute them among the authors.  The fee is charged even if the owner of the bar bought the disc.  Buying a physical carrier does not exempt the bar owner from paying this fee. <br><br>  Representatives of these CMOs complained of low incomes, and repeated in different ways the phrase that the author should have the right to receive money for his work.  An example was given of Western countries, where the mechanism for obtaining remuneration for the use of neighboring rights works and brings good income to the authors.  Once again, participating in legislative discussions, I heard complaints about the people and their legal culture.  They say the authors are good, but the country is not so, and the people did not leave the culture. <br><br>  I'm not iron - I was also upset for the authors.  Sad.  But then a thought came to me.  But designers are even worse.

      In particular, let's take an example of fees for music played in restaurants.  There are a lot of problems in this question: conditions of distribution, determination of who exactly will collect, etc.  But I want to dwell on the principle that underlies the collection. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Using the creative product of another person to increase the profitability of the institution is the main argument of the right holders.  However, why only music?  Is the designer who designed the restaurant premises, does not contribute to the growth of its income?  And the chef who cooked the dish?  And the architect who built the attractive building?  The level of the author's component is also high in these professions, these are creative professions. <br><br>  I noticed that the costumes that many of those present at the meeting were wearing - because they also contribute to career growth.  So why don't costumers receive multiple payments from multiple ‚Äúusers‚Äù every month?  Why, I know a man who repairs his shoes so much that his work has more in common with art than the work of many modern artists.  Design, embodied in things, replicated like a piece of music. <br><br>  To be honest, I do not know yet why this happened.  There is only one small assumption. <br><br>  I think that if only 4 companies owned the rights to 80% of world design; <br>  if designers had a worldwide organization that would create lists of countries subject to sanctions; <br>  if the US trade representative would hold conferences and seminars on the theme of designer‚Äôs remuneration rights; <br>  if stories about designers who died of starvation were spread on TV channels with the most expensive airtime; <br>  if parliamentary hearings were held on the topic of the protection of design rights <br>  the situation would be different. <br><br>  In the meantime.  While it is better to give the child to a music school than to art.  Copyright is in no hurry to equate designers with musicians. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/235781/">https://habr.com/ru/post/235781/</a></p>
