  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Impressions from attending i-Community 2010 and Yandex conferences</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Yesterday, on March 4th, I managed to attend the <a href="http://www.i-community2010.ru/">‚ÄúInternet Communities 2010‚Äù</a> conference (i-Community 2010, also #icom), and also to attend the ‚ÄúBlog Search‚Äù seminar at Yandex, combined with a short tour of their huge and beautiful office . <br><br> <a href=""><img src="http://img2.pict.com/69/4a/d3/3037506/0/320/img0097.jpg" width="300" alt="Greetings Yandex on i-Community 2010"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  With such inscriptions Yandex met the participants of the conference, which was held in the neighboring building.  I have no idea how they managed to unnoticeably stick these inscriptions while the first full hall watched the speakers speak and constantly saw this wall through the glass.

      Actually, the conference began with a short introduction on social media in Russia, after which the visitors dispersed into sections of interest. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="http://img2.pict.com/bd/86/22/3037501/0/320/img0092.jpg" width="300" alt="Opening i-Community 2010"></a> <br><br>  I stayed in the first room to listen to promising presentations on the topic of <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9">ROI</a> in social media.  The speakers gave beautiful presentations, spoke loudly and confidently, but unfortunately the topic was poorly disclosed.  Many people started with the statement that everything in ROI comes down to money and achieving goals, but when we went over to concrete examples, it turned out that it‚Äôs impossible to chase after the monetary benefits from social services, and this is even harmful.  The goals were set to ephemeral "promotion" of the brand, so far not measurable in money.  A very interesting phrase came from Evgeny Fedoseyev (Akado): <em>‚ÄúWorking with the blogosphere is like homeopathy.</em>  <em>You can drink tea once with sticky and not get the effect.</em>  <em>And you can drink it all the time and be vigorous and healthy, ‚Äùin</em> other words, it‚Äôs better to work with social media as a promotion channel and do it all the time, and may be unaware of direct returns than not working at all and watching for periodic kicks from the Internet‚Äôs reputation . <br><br>  Everyone agreed with this statement, including the listeners, who during the round table tried in every way to discredit the speakers by asking provocative and tricky questions.  Most of all, Alexander Blokhin got a case about promoting a photo studio, where the cost of attracting a potential client through Vkontakte and forums cost 1500 rubles per person, and Ilya Yermolaev for this plaque with not very clear formulas: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="http://img2.pict.com/c5/fd/de/3037502/0/320/img0095.jpg" width="300" alt="ROI Social Media at i-Community 2010"></a> <br><br>  Then there was a solemn awarding of the winners of the contest <a href="http://2010.blogruneta.ru/">‚ÄúRunet Blog 2010‚Äù</a> .  The winners were those who wanted it most and did not hesitate to ask for support.  In the photo, Boomburum (@boomburum) receives an award in the Microblog nomination.  Congratulations! <br><br> <a href=""><img src="http://img2.pict.com/1c/91/22/3037508/0/320/img0100.jpg" width="300" alt="Boomburum receives an award at the ceremony Blog of the Internet in the nomination Microblog"></a> <br><br>  After that, two sections passed in the first hall, entirely devoted to <strong>Twitter</strong> .  Started by Anton Volnukhin (@antonme) from Yandex, citing statistics about the growing popularity of Twitter in Russia and describing a portrait of a Russian twitter-reader.  And, before that, there was still a video interview with Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter ‚Äî to be honest, I didn‚Äôt remember anything, except the phrase that ‚ÄúRussia should develop Twitter, and not vice versa.‚Äù  In general, in my opinion, the most interesting presentation in this section was a report by the psychotherapist Mark Sandomirsky about which subconscious mechanisms are driven by users of social services.  If you have not been to the conference and have not had the opportunity to see the report in the online broadcast, be sure to download it when they post it, and take a look.  It is very interesting! <br><br>  In the last section, we talked about promotion cases via Twitter and mass-folding.  By the way, the ear was constantly cutting, when literally all the speakers uttered ‚ÄúFallOvers‚Äù with an emphasis on the second syllable.  For some reason, the stress in the word ‚Äúmass-folding‚Äù was done correctly.  Of the most prominent speakers in this section: <br>  - Vadim Chernets, who instead of the report gave a master class on replacing the background of the account on the Twitter web-face; <br>  - Nikita Kabardin, who said that, being the most important Russian mass-trailer, he followed each one in the hall at least 10 times.  He also managed to take part in a loud dispute with a Yandex representative on the fact that Yandex statistics on Russian-speaking Twitter accounts are inadequate, and voiced his figure of 110 thousand (185 thousand according to Yandex).  In general, there was a lot of loud controversy on the raised tones at the conference - at such moments it was awfully unpleasant and uncomfortable.  This is not to mention the periodic attacks of a comrade from the Kurchatov Institute, which on Twitter instantly turned into a #ded meme.  Photos of one of the skirmishes: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="http://img2.pict.com/89/76/22/3037511/0/320/img0106.jpg" width="300" alt="Dispute on i-Community 2010"></a> <br><br>  It was a good performance by Petit Didenko (@pdidenko) and a nice young man from Microsoft, Mikhail Chernomordikov (@mixen), about how Microsoft actually doesn‚Äôt care about Twitter for promotion, but which, nevertheless, periodically manages to enjoy and effectively.  Egor Danilov (@ M0rFium) from <a href="http://www.ivi.ru/">www.ivi.ru</a> talked about his Twitter case, and it was the best example of promotion through social media in runet from all that was shown at the conference. <br><br>  After the end of the conference, we went with a small handful of other participants to the neighboring building of the Yandex company.  There we were expected by the seminar ‚Äú <strong>Blog Search</strong> ‚Äù by Anton Volnukhin. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="http://img2.pict.com/43/99/18/3037512/0/320/img0118.jpg" width="300" alt="Seminar Blog Search in Yandex"></a> <br><br>  Well, in conclusion, the lovely and friendly employees of Yandex Masha and Daria took us through the back streets of the large and cozy office of the company. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="http://img2.pict.com/fe/64/8d/3037520/0/320/img0139.jpg" width="300" alt="Reception Yandex"></a> <br> <a href=""><img src="http://img2.pict.com/8a/55/45/3037514/0/320/img0121.jpg" width="300" alt="Yandex office"></a> <br> <a href=""><img src="http://img2.pict.com/bf/80/24/3037517/0/320/img0134.jpg" width="300" alt="Yandex office"></a> <br> <a href=""><img src="http://img2.pict.com/cb/31/76/3037518/0/320/img0136.jpg" width="300" alt="Studio coffee house Artemy Lebedev Yandex"></a> <br> <a href=""><img src="http://img2.pict.com/32/31/51/3037515/0/320/img0125.jpg" width="300" alt="Music room Yandex"></a> <br><br>  To top it off, I want to thank ROCIT for organizing the conference and Yandex company for the cordial welcome! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86501/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86501/</a></p>
