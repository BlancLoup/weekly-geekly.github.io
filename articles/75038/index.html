      MacHeist gives us an example of amazing marketing.  These guys are reselling software for Mac.  It seems nothing special. <br><br>  But still‚Ä¶ <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The most important thing is <b>how they do it</b> . <br><br>  From the buying process, a game of ‚Äúrobbery‚Äù is made.  They offer these programs "pull off."  So, by the way, the second word in the name of the company is translated - Heist.  It‚Äôs just impossible to buy programs.  For this you need to solve a bunch of puzzles.  And then you get them either for free or with a huge discount. <br><br>  "Robbery" is done naturally with the consent of the manufacturers. <br><br>  The marketing of these guys has been criticized and attacked.  However, they live, thrive and share their financial successes with others. <br><br>  Technology: <br><ul><li>  programs are sold in bulk (for example, the cost is separately $ 300, and Macheist gives them for 35) </li><li>  for a very limited time (eg, a week) </li><li>  with a very high resonance on the Internet (customers are encouraged to spread information about sales, for example, last time they gave additional discounts for links on Twitter) </li></ul><br>  However, this time the incredible happened.  <a href="http://www.macheist.com/">Macheist</a> hand out a set of 6 programs worth $ 154 for free.  And right now. <br><br>  What is the trick?  <b>Where is the benefit?</b> <br><br>  Everything is very simple.  To obtain these programs, you must go through a simple registration procedure.  Leave your details.  In exchange for them you get links for downloading 6 programs and codes for 5. You will also receive code for the 6th, BUT as soon as the number of registered participants reaches 500,000 people. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ce3/b06/f3f/ce3b06f3f563bbe045ed57eb8bdec57f.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  The programs are worthwhile.  6th, for example - the equivalent of Word, which "eats" several times less than the RAM. <br><br>  Send a link to your friends is worth nothing.  And, as it is not strange - people invite their friends to ‚Äúrob‚Äù Mac developers.  I myself learned about it from the newsletter. <br><br>  The site has a beautiful counter registered and saved money.  It looks fascinating.  The hype live.  Come and just see how the numbers are spinning. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ceb/201/f0d/ceb201f0d2e494ff2d26e27e2116aa17.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Business brings millions of dollars.  Even taking into account the fact that part of the money (frankly, considerable, in the hundreds of thousands of dollars) goes to charity. <br><br>  The most interesting thing is that these guys will assemble a base of half a million customers in 7 days.  Grateful customers.  Customers who helped save $ 77,000,000 (yes, yes, millions).  Customers who are ready to receive sales mailing.  Customers who are willing to distribute information about them.  Because MacHeist is great. <br><br>  It's clear that most likely, as it happens in the right marketing, the cost of attracting a client is calculated.  But ... this example confirms the long-standing truth: to get something, you have to give something.  And the better it will be something very, very good. <br><br>  Like this.  Now sit down and think of how to apply all of the above in your business and make lots and lots of money. <br><br>  Information taken from: <ul><li>  About MacHeist on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macheist">Wikipedia</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.macheistwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page">Fans of macheist</a> </li></ul><br><br>  <i>I think that the author deservedly wants to become a full member of the community, because the next invite will be given to him.</i>  <i><a href="http://www.puzzlee.ru/">His other articles</a> .</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Ps.</i>  <i>We are very glad that you liked the article.</i>  <i><s>Probably</s> soon the author himself will answer the questions raised in the comments.</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  <b>UPD: I ask the author of the article - <a href="https://habr.com/users/puzzlee/" class="user_link">puzzlee</a> .</b>  <b>Please, all thanks</b> <hh user="http://puzzlee.habrahabr.ru/"></hh>  <b>his.</b>  <b>He will try to shed light on the controversial issues that have arisen in the comments.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75038/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75038/</a></p>
