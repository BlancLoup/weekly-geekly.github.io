  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rosgosstrakh - legalized "kidalovo"!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I recently bought an apartment, made repairs in it, and wondered how to protect the apartment from various natural disasters in the person of neighbors and Krivorukov ZhEK‚Äôs masters.  Because  the option of extermination of neighbors (and masters of housing offices in particular) is not very much approved by the Criminal Code of Russia, we had to think about reducing or compensating for possible damage.  Having seen plenty of advertising with Bondarchuk, I decided to go to the notorious Rosgosstrakh. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Very quickly the aunt came, who began to actively campaign for the most expensive insurance options.  However, most of my clarifying questions remained unanswered, since  The insurance agent did not know the answers.  During the conversation, she admitted that she works as an auto insurance agent and practically does not possess information about apartment insurance.  To my reasonable question, how can I find out what I should pay for each year, she replied with a chic phrase: ‚Äúwhen the insured event happens to you, then you will find out everything.  In the meantime, don‚Äôt eat my brain and choose the most expensive tariff plan, it‚Äôs rulez! ‚Äù <br><br>  Realizing that there would be no sense from an aunt with chicken brains, I decided to go directly to the department for damages and find out the possible amounts of compensation.  Below is a literal dialogue: <br>  - Hello, the company "Rosgosstrakh". <br>  - Hello, I would like to clarify the amount of compensation as a result of the insured event. <br>  - What happened to you? <br>  - So far, thank God, nothing happened.  Just wanted to clarify in advance.  For example, I insured expensive furniture from the flood and an insured event occurred.  How much can be calculated? <br>  - The amount of compensation depends on the damage caused to the furniture.  If the glass was broken, the mirror was broken, the door was broken, then the work on this repair will be paid. <br>  - Sorry, but when a pipe is leaking, the glass in the furniture is usually not broken.  Just the tree swelled and lost its presentation.  Facing in many places potsavala and furniture can not be repaired. <br>  - Do you have glass and mirrors in place?  Do all doors open? <br>  - Yes! <br>  - There is no damage to the functionality, and for damage to the appearance you can expect a maximum of 3% of the declared value of the furniture. <br>  - Ie  I pay for insurance of an apartment every year more than I can get when an insured event occurs ??? <br>  - Nuuuu.  Uh ... yes. <br>  - And in what case will I get 100% of the cost of furniture? <br>  - In case of its complete destruction by water! <br>  - O_O THIS IS HOW ????????????????? <br>  - For example, a CABINET BROUGHTED WATER FLOW to the balcony, knocked out the glass, raised to the level of the railing and threw off from the 3rd floor, which led to the complete destruction of furniture. <br>  - Ooh, give two!  Is fire the same? <br>  - And then!  If the glass is cracked, we will pay for their replacement.  If the hinges from the heat have floated, we will replace the hinges.  And for smoked furniture with a coating swelling from the heat, you will also receive a maximum of 3% of the declared value of the furniture. <br>  - Well, you give a pancake!  Here you also insure the design against damage.  If the walls are cracked as a result of the fire, then in this case how much money will I get? <br>  - 100% of the declared value can be obtained only in the case of complete destruction of the brickwork. <br>  - Ie  Need to get a good bomb into the house? <br>  - Yes.  Although this is a military action, they need to choose another insurance plan. <br>  - Thank. <br><br>  Summary: the only type of insurance profitable for people is insurance against theft of equipment.  Although thieves often spoil the furniture and some things, looking for hidden money and jewelry.  Sometimes they break through plasterboard walls, rip up soft furniture, etc.  In this case, renting an apartment under the alarm will help.  Very many people sign the contract without reading, because  It takes up several pages of text in very small print.  It is not always possible to find out the amount of compensation from an insurance agent, I think this is a fundamental position of the company.  When the insured event occurred, the person is left alone with his misfortune, without receiving any real help from the insurance company.  If the damage to furniture worth 150,000 rubles, a person will receive 1.5-4.5 tr. <br>  &lt;.habracut&gt; </div>
