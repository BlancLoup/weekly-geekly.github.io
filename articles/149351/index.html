  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Steam or Windows Store. Or why I choose Steam for now.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Over the past couple of days, the hype has risen regarding innovations on Steam, which has already been <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/149300/">written on Habr√©</a> .  After reading the topics and comments to them, I realized that not everyone has reliable data about these app stores.  In particular, I want to talk about the Windows Store, and more specifically about why I am still betting on Steam. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I have long wanted to get a unified application delivery system, which was so lacking on Windows.  I tried a bunch of systems to monitor application updates and install the applications themselves.  Not one of them met my needs. <br><br>  A couple of years ago, I began to actively use Steam, first I sat in free games, then I started buying.  I realized that being ‚Äúnot a pirate‚Äù is very simple.  I realized that the only thing that limited me from this was the convenience of purchase.  Since then, I have formulated for myself some criteria for this kind of shopping: <br><ol><li>  Convenience of purchase; </li><li>  Binding applications to the account; </li><li>  Installation and updates from the same store, and not from third-party sources. </li></ol><br><br>  Time passed, RP Windows 8 came out, I installed it as a combat system, I looked at the ‚ÄúStor‚Äù, read the rules for publishing applications, and was disappointed.  I realized that I would not get what I expected anyway.  He does not meet my criteria, specifically: <br><ol><li>  It will be possible to download and buy far from all software.  Microsoft divided applications into Metro-applications and ‚Äúclassic applications‚Äù.  For classic applications, a link will be provided by which it will be possible to purchase it (example in the screenshot below); </li><li>  As a result, I‚Äôm not sure that the applications I bought will be tied to my account.  And again I will have to keep my license keys written on a piece of paper; </li><li>  As a result, I‚Äôm not sure that I can install and update all the applications I need from one place. </li></ol>

After all, I really appreciated the coolness of linking purchases to the account.  I do not need to store the keys / disks in order to look for them again and again after reinstalling the game.  Judging by the stated, we can expect that Valve will make the app store as convenient as it is for games. <br>  I respect, and in my own way I love each of the OS.  Under Linux, I enjoy the convenience of working with repositories; under iOS and Makos, I like the AppStore.  And I still hope that Microsoft will make its store more convenient and comfortable. <br><br>  Perhaps a similar step was taken because they are afraid of new lawsuits from the anti-monopoly commission, or maybe they did not plan to do so.  But I hope that the appearance of applications in the incentive will affect Microsoft's opinion on their stor, and they will reconsider their decision.  After all, competition is always good, good for both Steam and Microsoft, and most importantly, what's good for the end user. <br><br>  Also, do not forget about ordinary users, who, unlike advanced users, are unlikely to set themselves a stim.  If put, it is not a fact that they will use. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149351/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149351/</a></p>
