The founders of Yahoo, Google and eBay are all recent students, just over 20 years old.  But it seems the age threshold is dropping even more.  In America, there are teenagers who founded a successful business and earned their first million at the age of 16-17 years. <br><br>  For example, here is <a href="http://news.com.com/2102-1038_3-6202845.html%3Ftag%3Dst.util.print">an interview</a> with American Catherine Cook, who at the age of 17 made the youth site <a href="http://www.myyearbook.com/">MyYearbook</a> .  In just a year and a half, the site‚Äôs audience has grown to 3 million people per month, and advertising revenue to several million dollars a year.  Venture investors have just appeared, who financed a startup for $ 4.1 million. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The main audience of the site is Americans aged 13‚Äì22 years old, who want to get to know each other and ‚Äúhang out‚Äù coolly on the Internet.  The site is suitable for this as well as possible: there is a dating department, puzzles and quizzes, an online ‚Äúglossy‚Äù UGC magazine (the number of comments on some articles reaches 3000), celebrity gossip and everything else that is so interesting to teenagers.  Duel contests are very popular, where the participants ‚Äúslip away‚Äù with each other in the battle for the best video.  Viewers enjoy watching these duels, vote and leave comments.  An adult would never have made a portal that teenagers would have liked so much. <br><br>  Over the next year, Catherine Cook with her younger brother Dave (he co-founded the business) hopes to turn her website into the largest teen portal in the United States.  Now it is the third social network in America after Myspace and Facebook.

      In general, the idea to create such a site came when Catherine and Dave moved to a new city and went to a new school.  They did not know anyone there, and at first it was quite hard for them.  To establish contact with classmates, they came up with such an excellent thing: the ability to publish your photos on the Internet, make acquaintances.  At first it was just an idea.  Then came the older brother Jeff, who invested in their project $ 250 thousand of personal money (he himself earned this money on an Internet startup in college).  And so began the real business.  Now you can hire Indians to develop templates, scripts and high-quality design.  The whole site was created by experts from India under the contract.  It turned out to be very cheap and of high quality. <br><br>  The first version of the site was very different from what is now.  New features and sections of the portal (which are now the most popular) were prompted by classmates themselves during breakfasts in the cafeteria and at recess, as well as other site visitors.  These were great ideas.  For example, the function of duels competitions (battles) allowed increasing the attendance of a resource six times since February of the current year. <br><br>  At the age of ten, Katrick Cook realized that she could never work in the office, and being a boss and running her own business was much more fun.  Now a teenager has 30 people under her control, to whom she pays her salary.  True, it is formally ruled by Jeff, who holds the position of CEO. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/13318/">https://habr.com/ru/post/13318/</a></p>
