  <section class="page js-page"><h1>8 of the worst websites in the world</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The blog Name.com published a ranking of the most terrible sites in the world.  Among these sites there are simply ugly, there are almost non-usable, and some may serve as a standard of banality and lack of interest. <br><br>  According to the author of the blog, these sites are so disgusting that their authors must have created them under the influence of hard drugs.  Therefore, if you think that the design of your site is not professional enough, or it lacks originality and diversity, you can raise your self-esteem by looking at the eight most terrible sites on the Internet. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1. MIA UK 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
      <a href="http://www.miauk.com/">http://www.miauk.com/</a> <br><br>  If you have not yet had a headache after viewing the start page, continue navigating the site. <br>  Pages with a huge amount of long-loading items and links that go nowhere will make you tear your hair out.  A terrible combination of poisonous green and bright blue colors and a lot of videos piled up in one pile.  If you are not crazy, visit their Facebook page and watch their videos with broken English and text popping over the video. <br><br>  2. Space is the Place <br><br>  <a href="http://www.spaceistheplace.ca/">http://www.spaceistheplace.ca/</a> <br><br>  First of all, you will see an annoying GIF, on which a spacecraft takes off every second.  On a dazzling bright blue background - the text of sky-blue color.  Just below - the head of the author of the site, cutting in the clouds.  The site contains scattered information about space flights and photos of the author with rockets and astronauts. <br><br>  This site is not only unpleasant for the eye, but it can only interest the acquaintances of the author of the site and those who like middle-aged people who are fond of astronautics. <br><br>  3. Ling's Cars <br><br>  <a href="http://www.lingscars.com/">http://www.lingscars.com/</a> <br><br>  The site dedicated to the sale of used cars, all filled with sparkling banners and stickers of all colors of the rainbow, it has hundreds of links that lead to the same page with sparkling banners.  Wherever possible, you will see photos of Lina himself (the owner of the site).  Especially delivers the image of Lina with a constantly shaking head.  All the worst that can be in advertising is on this site. <br><br>  4. ARNGREN <br><br>  <a href="http://www.arngren.net/">www.arngren.net</a> <br><br>  This is a sample of how not to make sites designed for trade.  A huge assortment of goods seemed piled up on the start page in a completely random sequence.  Find the product of interest is very difficult.  On the left side of the site there is a menu, thanks to which you can select the type of product you are interested in, but following the link you will see the same chaotic design, and the products often do not correspond to the indicated categories.  Also on the site there is no information about the owners of the site, about what they sell and why they should buy something. <br><br>  5. Ronoslund <br><br>  <a href="http://www.ronoslund.com/">www.ronoslund.com</a> <br><br>  Ron Aslund‚Äôs personal page, with a cosmic landscape and terrible design on which he advertises his Internet project, hangs out photographs of outdated computers and Princess Diana (with text over the photos). <br><br>  Ron Aslund takes multitasking and universality of sites to a new level. <br><br>  6. The World's Worst Website Ever <br><br>  <a href="http://www.theworldsworstwebsiteever.com/">www.theworldsworstwebsiteever.com</a> <br><br>  This site was created by a professional webdesigner in order to gather in one place the typical mistakes of the authors of the sites and clearly show how not to make the sites.  <a href="http://www.theworldsworstwebsiteever.com/new_page_1.htm">Here</a> you can read a complete list of 60 errors that the designer intentionally made.  However, compared to the top five, this site turned out pretty good.  But the author of the site promises to soon create a site with even more errors. <br><br>  7. Rent my Chest <br><br>  <a href="http://www.rentmychest.com/">www.rentmychest.com</a> <br><br>  This site is dun with a random mix of words and was conceived as a decoy site with keywords that correspond to links to other resources.  The site owner offers to host a link to your page at an approximate price of $ 20 to $ 200, depending on the design of the keyword (a large or colored font will be expensive). <br><br>  8. Neuticles <br>  <a href="http://www.neuticles.com/">www.neuticles.com</a> <br><br>  Although the design of this site is more or less normal, its content is amazing.  The authors of the project sell genital implants for castrated pets.  With them, the owners will not be complexes about the lack of eggs in their pets, and the animals themselves will not be so keenly aware of their inferiority. <br><br>  One implant costs $ 75 - it is much more expensive than the cost of surgery to remove these genitals. <br><br>  So a bad website design can not only reduce, but even increase its traffic: people from all over the world will go to your page to laugh! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149106/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149106/</a></p>
