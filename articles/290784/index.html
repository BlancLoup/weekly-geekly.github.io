In general, this played a key role in choosing the specifics of our school.  We decided to use our knowledge and experience in this industry to create truly effective educational programs with measurable results.  But we are just beginning and want to tell you about the outstanding in our opinion courses and schools, where they themselves studied and taught. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The concepts of <i>Internet marketing</i> and <i>digital marketing</i> in Russia appeared relatively recently - <i>Internet marketing</i> became widespread around 2008, and only in 2012 <i>digital</i> .  However, despite the youth of these areas, they have firmly consolidated their positions in the marketing tools of both small businesses and giants.  Marketing planning for any organization now does not do without Internet marketing tools. <br><br>  <b>Here are some figures for 2014 to estimate the volume of the digital market in Russia:</b> <br><ul><li>  At the end of the year, <b>59.9 million</b> people go online every day.  This is <b>51% of the</b> total population of Russia over 18 years old.  <sup>[one]</sup> </li><li>  We occupy the sixth place in the world in terms of Internet penetration - <b>84 million</b> Russians use the Internet.  <sup>[2]</sup> </li><li>  The volume of advertising on the Internet amounted to <b>84.6 billion</b> rubles.  Display advertising - <b>19.1 billion</b> rubles, contextual advertising - <b>65.5 billion</b> rubles.  <sup>[3]</sup> </li><li>  Over the past year, <b>25.4 million</b> people made <b>195 million</b> orders on the Internet in the amount of 645 billion rubles.  <sup>[four]</sup> </li><li>  Only CMS Magazine has <b>8,768 web studios</b> operating in Russia.  But not all are listed there. </li></ul><br><br>  Most often, online marketing companies are engaged in specialized agencies.  Why it is more profitable than keeping specialists in your staff, you probably should not be explained.  Not so long ago, marketers almost with their eyes closed entrusted Internet marketing to contractors, not trying to grasp the essence of what was happening.  Now more and more specialists are trying to expand the scope of their competencies and improve their skills by attending various seminars and courses on digital marketing.  And it is very encouraging, because with the growth of digital marketing coverage, the number of unscrupulous and simply illiterate contractors is also growing, which means you need to understand who to entrust your business to.  But finding good courses is also not so easy, so we‚Äôll tell you a little about those we can vouch for.

    <ul><li>  <b>IKRA - interactive communications in advertising.</b>  The guys have offices in both capitals of our wonderful country <i>(Karina said, sitting in a coffee shop in Seattle)</i> and several other cities.  Training takes place in several formats - the main course, which lasts several months;  two-day intensives;  exit campuses and levelup.  What is taught?  Creative, brand management, SMM, event events and much more fun and interesting.  <b><i>Distinctive feature: the</i></b> courses are intended mostly for professionals working in digital agencies. </li><li>  <b>Netology - online learning.</b>  One of the advantages of online learning is that geography is completely unimportant - the main thing is to have access to the Internet.  Two learning formats - "library" and "university".  A ‚Äúlibrary‚Äù is an access to a large number of recorded courses.  The average duration of such courses is two hours, and you get access by subscription and can watch them indefinitely.  "University" is a series of webinars, the average duration of training is two months.  For such a course, payment depends on the chosen specialty.  Subject areas of Netology are very diverse - from start-ups and finance to UX-design.  <b><i>What is special</i></b> is about 100 recorded short courses of different levels of complexity, which makes this ‚Äúlibrary‚Äù universal for all specialists. </li><li>  <b>TopExpert - courses on SEO, SEM, internet marketing.</b>  Geographically, the guys are based in Moscow, but many of their courses are online.  One of the bonuses - all materials will be provided to you in the record, so the materials will definitely stay with you.  From the first line of description it is easy to determine the specifics of the courses.  The program is quite detailed and extensive, so it is possible to enroll both for the full course and for individual modules.  <b><i>Separately</i></b> , we <b><i>note</i></b> that it is the very course on SEO that is very good, and we highly recommend it to specialists who want to work and understand this area. </li><li>  <b>IMpro - internet marketing education &amp; consulting.</b>  Of course, about yourself you can not tell.  We are the youngest of all the courses listed, but we try to keep up.  Geographically, we are based so far only in cultural Petersburg and slightly in Seattle.  What are our cookies?  Online courses.  webinars, open lectures, a recording knowledge base, two-day intensives, coaching and another sea of ‚Äã‚Äãeverything planned.  We are very enthusiastic about digital, so we constantly hold free seminars and webinars.  For now, we‚Äôre mostly sharpening on internet marketing, but soon we‚Äôll have start-up courses.  We would like to put the <b><i>greatest emphasis</i></b> on individual coaching before the result (joint work on the project for several months before reaching concrete results together with school experts).  This is exactly the direction that seems to us the most promising and effective for those who want to consolidate their knowledge and apply it to their business. </li></ul><br>  That's all for now.  The list, of course, is small, but proven.  We hope you find it useful.  And in the near future we will publish material on where and how to study for free. <br>  <b>And remember: in the digital world you can never stop learning!</b> <br><ol><li>  <a href="http://fom.ru/SMI-i-internet/11889">POF</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/">Internet Live Stats</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.akarussia.ru/knowledge/market_size/id5354">ACAR</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.datainsight.ru/ecommerce2014">DATA insight</a> </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290784/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290784/</a></p>
