  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What does Junior need to get settled?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Not so long ago, I was answering <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/qa/11036/">Habrovoprosa</a> about what you need to know in order to get a job as a programmer after high <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/qa/11036/">school</a> , after which I was asked a question in a personal, as well as Vkontakte, and what exactly is needed in detail. <br>  In this article I will try to tell you what a young professional who is looking for a job should know.  I know a little about this issue, because  a year ago, after the 3rd course, I posed the problem of employment and successfully found my place, which I could combine with studies.  And I still remember what I was talking about at the interviews (of which there were few, but they were successful). <br>  Immediately it should be noted that this article is not suitable for those whose goal is to work exclusively in the so-called Major Players (Google, Yandex, Microsoft, etc.). <br>  To whom it is interesting - welcome under the cut (under the cut vacancies for Moscow and Kazan from the comments, as well as a proposal for an internship for Peter). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, Junior is a programmer who should be able to do everything and nothing at the same time. <br>  Read more about each of the statements. <br><br>  <b>Junior should be able to do everything</b> <br>  The person who came to get a job as a junior programmer should know the language in which he is going to write (to know does not mean to be able to absolutely everything, but to feel confident if asked to write something).  You should also understand the specifics of a particular area of ‚Äã‚Äãinterest (if you are going to code for networks, you should have an idea about networks, what is there and how). <br><br>  <b>Junior should be able to do anything</b> <br>  At the same time, if they are looking for Junior, they are ready to teach.  You may not be able to write literate code, be able to comment on it well and so on, and frankly, it is unlikely that a person without production experience will be able to do it.

      <br>
      It seems that I did not say anything new, and there is no specifics, but it cannot be.  There are no specific general requirements for Juniors, there are specific requirements for a vacancy, you can search on hh.ru, it says. <br><br>  <b>Now about the things that will help you find your place.</b> <br>  If you are a student, it means that you will not be able to boast of work experience, and your student successes hardly interest your employer, if this is certainly not a super-duper achievement at competitions, contests, etc. But no one bothers you to do your own projects that you can talk about (I at Junior's interviews almost all the time he was talking about his <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gdev/127378/">project</a> ), it gives the employer a chance to understand that although there is no commercial development experience - there is experience in working on a task, experience in formulating tasks, perhaps experience in a team, this is valued more  than a term on ‚ÄúProgramming in C ++‚Äù in semester 5. <br>  Another very important issue is - Algorithms and data structures.  It so happened that when you apply for a Junior job, many companies are ready to forgive you for not knowing these things, because your job as a Junior will most likely, unfortunately, be frying the code. <br><br>  Conclusion: write something for yourself, write useful utilities, write with friends, participate in third-party projects.  This experience will allow you to learn your programming language better, learn to write better and more clearly. <br><br>  <b>Finally</b> <br>  I did not say anything new in this article, I just tried to tell you that you don‚Äôt need to know anything special, you just need to know and be confident in yourself, be able to solve problems, be able to set tasks.  And the work experience is replaced by the experience of participation in various projects. <br><br>  Successes you in search. <br><br>  PS And do not repeat mistakes when a person came to settle in the summer for Junior C ++ and could not write a simple cycle, explaining that ‚ÄúSummer, I forgot everything.‚Äù <br>  PPS <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/programming/128105/">Here</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/programming/128129/">here are</a> good, in my opinion, collections of literature.  You can choose something to your liking. <br><br>  <b>UPD: Here is a list of vacancies suggested in the comments.</b> <br>  <b>Moscow:</b> If you know linux / svn / php5 / mysql / jquery / zend and do not have much experience, write <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/kai/" class="user_link">kai</a> to get a chance to get a job in a decent company with a name. <br>  <b>Moscow:</b> Requirements: PHP5 (not OOP skills, alas, is welcome), MySQL (complex intersections, subqueries), JS | jQuery. <br>  Experience is not required, it requires the ability to understand the code and other people's logic, and the presence of his own.  Several jobs. <br>  Write <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/trijin/" class="user_link">trijin</a> <br>  <b>Kazan:</b> Enough of the basics of PHP, Js and MySQL, the rest will teach.  To write to the user <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/rednaxi/" class="user_link">rednaxi</a> or to soap job@beboss.ru <br>  <b>Kazan:</b> We are looking for a person: php, mysql, js, of course, know the basics themselves: css and html. <br>  You can write in a personal user <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ainu/" class="user_link">ainu</a> or in the gill (in a personal there) <br>  <b>Open Source Invitations:</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/alexeygrigorev/" class="user_link">alexeygrigorev</a> invites to <a href="http://jtalks.org/">jtalks.org</a> - write on Java engine for forums, blogs, etc.  Mainly involved Junior'y. <br>  <b>Internship invitations:</b> <br>  <b>Peter:</b> For those who are interested in internships in web development (php, postgres, memcached, html5, mobile applications, etc.), we invite you to join the Zen-mani team (zenmoney.ru) <br>  Internship includes training on the example of real tasks on the project.  The conditions are very simple: while we teach, it is free for you and for us.  As soon as you start doing things yourself, we start paying a scholarship.  If after 3-4 months you are gaining the right level, it is possible the device in the state of the company with a salary.  The scholarship is 10 thousand per month, the salary after the internship will depend on the level gained and can grow to 40-50 thousand per year. <br>  By employment: we are ready to provide tasks for 12 hours a day, then, rather, a question for you.  We are more interested in not the time spent in the office, but the result.  You can study at home - great.  Naturally, it will be necessary to come to the office to discuss the tasks and analyze the solutions. <br>  Actual only for Peter and the suburbs.
