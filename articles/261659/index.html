  <section class="page js-page"><h1>11 products to solve the company's IT problems</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  ‚ÄúWhat is modern office software for you?  What IT tasks are set before you? ‚Äù- it was with such questions that we addressed representatives of small and medium-sized businesses (SMB) in order to understand their awareness, readiness and ways to solve IT problems.  The survey revealed a rather low awareness of possible offers in the software market. <br><br>  Why it happens?  - It is not difficult to guess.  Firstly, in the conditions of high competition, production and sales are in priority, it is just time that there is no elementary time to think through the search and select office software.  Secondly, the price of popular products for the SMB segment bites. <br><br>  It was for such companies that we prepared a sample of 11 reliable, inexpensive and simple, but at the same time necessary solutions for the organization of effective office operations, and also tested the compatibility of some of them among themselves, as well as with the corporate IT security solution - Traffic Inspector .

No problems were detected during the experiment. <br><br>  Kaspersky Endpoint Security was tested on virtual machines using desktop (Windows 7, 8.1) and server (Windows 2012 R2) operating systems.  Traffic Inspector 3.0.1 was installed on the server operating system, configured in gateway mode, configured clients, created traffic control rules.  Client machines were configured to work through a proxy. <br><br>  Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business has been selected as antivirus protection.  Before starting the installation, we downloaded the administration server distributions from the Kaspersky website: Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Windows for client machines and the Kaspersky Security Center management tool.  Kaspersky Endpoint Security is installed with optimal default settings, so systems and data are protected immediately after its installation. <br><br>  Subsequent configuration and protection management was carried out using a single console of Kaspersky Security Center, which simplifies the provision of control and protection of all workplaces.  It is especially necessary to note the presence of the protection functionality of corporate mobile devices (smartphones, tablets).  Using a single control center allows rational use of resources and contributes to greater software resilience to various types of threats. <br><br>  Antivirus scanning technologies work at different levels of the operating system, effectively removing malware.  The cloud network Kaspersky Security Network protects users from new threats in real time.  At the same time, flexible monitoring tools allow you to ensure that only authorized devices are connected to a PC on the network. <br><br>  Installing Kaspersky Endpoint Security did not affect the operation of TI and client machines.  The program activity monitoring system did not block the TI module. <br><br>  Load testing from client machines was performed using the utilities ¬´HTTP-Test¬ª, HttpTrafficGen. <br><br>  We also measured the speed of the Internet connection before installing Kaspersky Endpoint Security and after.  The measurement was performed using the <a href="http://speedtest.net/">speedtest.net</a> speed testing <a href="http://speedtest.net/">site</a> .  We also used FTP servers located on the Internet, with obviously large distribution channels, for example: <br><br>  <a href="http://devbuilds.kaspersky-labs.com/devbuilds/AVPTool/">devbuilds.kaspersky-labs.com/devbuilds/AVPTool</a> <br>  <a href="">ftp.drweb.com/pub/drweb/livecd</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.nvidia.ru/content/">www.nvidia.ru/content</a> <br>  <a href="">ftp.altlinux.ru/pub/distributions</a> <br><br>  To test the traffic between the client and the TI server, the <a href="http://software.es.net/iperf/">iperf</a> utility was <a href="http://software.es.net/iperf/">used</a> , which runs under all systems - free with open source and does not require installation under Windows.  The program is quite accurate: the results coincide with each other in several dimensions.  We ran it on the server from the TI and the client machine on both sides of the channel under test (on the one hand, in server mode, on the other, in client mode).  The speed (channel bandwidth) is tested only in one direction - from the client to the server, that is, the client transmits data, and the server accepts.  To test the channel bandwidth in the opposite direction, the server and the client are swapped at the ends of the channel.  iperf can generate ‚Äúnowhere‚Äù traffic, for example, to a non-existent address.  With its help, the channel or network interface was loaded to the required value. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0c5aa5">Conclusion</font> </h2><br>  Typical potential IT threats include not only external (viruses, spam, hacker attacks, spyware, etc.), but also internal (theft of confidential information, misuse of resources), and the second group in statistics is the most dangerous and it is growing: according to a report from <a href="http://www.infowatch.ru/report2014">InfoWatch</a> Analytical Center, the number of information leaks from Russian companies in 2014 exceeded the results of 2013 by 73%.  And if large corporations can cope with financial and reputational losses, for small and medium businesses, the damage is much more tangible and could end in bankruptcy.
