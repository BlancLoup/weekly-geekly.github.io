For a start, a small lyrical digression - to cover the life of our startup <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/tipmeet/">TipMeet</a> in front of the Habrahabr audience, this is perhaps the best thing that could happen.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/tipmeet/blog/98378/">We received a</a> huge amount of feedback, opinions, comments, suggestions, bug reports and rays of positive emotions.  Immediately there was a plate with <i>food for the mind</i> , a spoonful of decisiveness and a desire to develop. <br><br><h4>  O simple </h4><br>  In fact, it is not so important whether you take calls by the nature of your business or use a mobile phone exclusively to communicate with friends and family.  It is important that none of the users of city telephone networks, the services of mobile operators or IP-telephony tools want to <i>have problems</i> .  With the purchase / registration, configuration and subsequent payment.  Trouble-free, in our case, called ease of use, is a key parameter for almost any person choosing one way or another of the way to connect with another person. <br><br>  If we are talking about business, then there is no doubt: the faster and having gone through fewer obstacles, a client comes to you - the greater the likelihood that he will return and bring acquaintances.  Which will remain satisfied and loyal in the future.  Therefore, each person, one way or another, dealing with his ‚Äúconsumers‚Äù will strive to simplify communication, increase its flexibility and quality.

      The good news is that you are not alone.  The world of telecommunication technologies, as we know it today, is literally created to use all its benefits.  And do not be afraid of <i>random roaming</i> , redirections, etc.  We are working to ensure that anyone who wants to remain open to any contacts, in addition to their network profile or to connect with new customers, can afford it both to themselves and to others. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Despite the fact that <a href="http://www.tipmeet.com/">TipMeet</a> exists relatively recently, we already have enough users who appreciated the potential of profitability and installed the <a href="http://www.tipmeet.com/about/call-me/">CallMe! Widget</a> on their web pages.  What for?  In order for any visitor to know that he can call you at almost any moment, ask an important question, and possibly place an order.  At the same time, the person calling you will not know how you took the call - being online or transferring the call to a mobile phone. <br><br>  There are also representatives of professions for whom it is important to be in touch.  Speaking of "being in touch," I do not mean e-mail, Skype, ICQ, and others ... no.  ‚ÄúTo be in touch‚Äù means for me to give an opportunity to any person, no matter where he is instantly located - in South Africa or Moscow, to call me and hear my voice in dynamics.  At the same time, I don‚Äôt need to install something somewhere, I can call with a so-called.  Public page: <a href="http://www.tipmeet.com/callme/shapelez">http://www.tipmeet.com/callme/shapelez</a> .  By the way - I will wait for calls with interesting suggestions and questions, do not hesitate! <br><br>  This page on our site can register anyone.  This simple link will help your audience, regardless of its location and any other conditions (except, perhaps, time) to establish contact with you. <br><br>  Of course, network wolves are not the only potential TipMeet users.  On the basis of our service, you can organize a whole call center if the situation requires it or a whim. <br><br>  When using a <a href="http://www.tipmeet.com/support/how_to_receive_calls/">SIP phone</a> , including video support (programs, for example: <a href="http://www.tipmeet.com/support/integration/x-lite/">X-Lite</a> or devices: Grandstream GXV3140 / IP-PBX) on the client side, we fully support almost all the functions of modern IP-telephony: call forwarding, Auto Answer, Do Not Disturb, etc.  Not to mention the best communication quality and reliability compared to a microphone built somewhere. <br><br>  IPhone owners can rejoice - they can also get all the benefits of a SIP phone using their favorite iPhone, you just need to have an installed application for working with the SIP protocol, like <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bria-iphone-edition-mobile/id373968636%3Fmt%3D8">Bria</a> . <br><br>  Here the technical capabilities end, and your plans and ideas start working.  You can even organize a whole mobile office that will travel with your employees around the world.  Conversely, people will have the opportunity to break away from their workplace, without limiting themselves to formal barriers - <a href="http://www.tipmeet.com/support/integration/tipmeet2go/">TipMeet2Go</a> allows <a href="http://www.tipmeet.com/support/integration/tipmeet2go/">you</a> to organize your business online. <br><br>  Join us now, get in touch with people who bring you money, first of all there is no one to wait for, competitors will come tomorrow. <br><br>  Let me remind you also that we still have a small bonus - everyone who <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/tipmeet/%3Fref%3Dts">signs up for TipMeet on Facebook</a> will receive $ 0.90 to redirect their first calls.  For a Moscow resident, <a href="http://www.tipmeet.com/rates/">for example</a> , this is about 15 minutes of conversation on his mobile phone (90 on a city phone) with a person who made one click on a button somewhere on the Internet. <br><br>  Live by communication! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99199/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99199/</a></p>
