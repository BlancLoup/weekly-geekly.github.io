      In October, the <a href="http://blockchain.community/">Blockchain Community</a> was launched - this is a voluntary association of professionals, entrepreneurs, services and enthusiasts interested in learning, developing and applying blockchain technologies. <br><br>  Objectives of the Blockchain Community: <br><ul><li>  Consolidation and representation of blockchain community members </li><li>  Providing advice and technical expertise </li><li>  Informational support during hackathons and conferences </li><li>  Communication with specialists for combining competences, sharing experience and open technologies </li><li>  Comprehensive support for young teams </li></ul><br>  At the moment, the Blockchain Community‚Äôs management includes enthusiasts and the administration of several websites dedicated to cryptotechnologies, blockchain, cryptocurrencies and fintech.  If you have questions about the blockchain and projects based on it, feel free to contact the Blockchain Community, this is exactly the center around which the community is going.  There you can find partners, investors, friends or just a hint where to look for answers to your questions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/62c/b53/667/62cb5366719a4975b416bf3e565ce9b7.png"><br><br>  The first international Fintech cluster of <a href="http://futurefintech.org/">Future</a> Fintech has opened in Moscow, the goal of which is to develop innovative technologies in the financial sector and attract foreign investment in the Russian market.  Future Fintech is located in the modern business center Moscow-City: "City of Capitals", on Presnenskaya Embankment, 8.  p.1, on the second floor.  In the same building on the ground floor is located <a href="https://www.ibank.ru/">iBank</a> , which is one of the organizers of the FINTECH cluster.  Also among the organizers of <a href="http://deepknowledgeventures.com/">Deep Knowledge Ventures</a> and <a href="http://blockchain.community/">Blockchain Community</a> . <br><br>  Fintech cluster itself has four main areas: <br><ul><li>  <b>Incubator</b> : a program for generating new ideas and launching MVP (minimum operating product) in 6 to 8 weeks. </li><li>  <b>Accelerator</b> : a comprehensive development program for already working Fintech projects for two months. </li><li>  <b>Coworking</b> : a space for collaboration projects.  May be provided free of charge.  There are plans to hold meetings of startups with experts, entrepreneurs and investors. </li><li>  <b>FinTech events</b> : daytime activities such as hackathons, master classes and others to draw attention to coworking and the interaction of everyone who wants to contribute to the development of the FINTECH industry. <br></li></ul><br>  Alex Fork, head of the Future Fintech accelerator and head of the BlockChain Community: <br><blockquote>  As strategic partners, we see participants in the modern Fintech business, and these are not only banks.  Now in the financial sector there are mobile operators, Internet companies, payment services, insurance, and trading companies.  Existing activities for the development of startups aimed at the interests of a single investor narrow the range of opportunities for the emergence of breakthrough technologies, as they are focused exclusively on local business objectives.  We plan to create a harmonious alliance of strategic partners who gain a competitive advantage over the other participants in the market. </blockquote><br>  Dmitry Kaminsky, Senior Partner, Venture Fund Deep Knowledge Ventures (Hong Kong): <br><blockquote>  We consider Fintech cluster as an innovative center of technology, knowledge, community and resources, focusing on peer2peer projects, blockchain, machine learning and artificial intelligence.  Participants who have proven the effectiveness of the business model of their project, get access to the resources and the global ecosystem of partners, thus ensuring the dynamic development of the project throughout its growth. </blockquote><br>  At the moment, there are already 4 startups that are working on this site, and there is a set of new teams.  If you want to make your fintech startup - velcom! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cb8/b15/c44/cb8b15c44696408a9faf15f1dcd97056.png"><br><br>  The prototyping center of the Higher School of Economics HSE {LAB} together with QIWI and Lykke conducted a series of free blockchain workshops in Moscow: <br><br>  <a href="http://hselab.ru/news/mnogoobeshchayushchaya-raspredelennost-seriya-master-klassov-po-blokcheyn-tehnologii-v-hselab-0">Ownership on the blockchain</a> : Issue of shares on the blockchain, registration of ownership of the blockchain, issue of discount coupons on the blockchain - and this is not a complete list of what can be implemented on the Colored coins protocol.  The Protocol of Colored Coins also makes it easy to sell and buy any digital objects - music, e-books, works of art and software. <br><br>  <a href="http://hselab.ru/news/mnogoobeshchayushchaya-raspredelennost-seriya-master-klassov-po-blokcheyn-tehnologii-v-hselab-v">Promising distribution</a> : Dash protocol (formerly Dark Coins protocol) is a solution for those who are concerned about ensuring the privacy of transactions on the blockchain.  How is privacy protected?  Who uses it when?  What is the difference between this blockchain system and Bitcoin? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d2/37f/00f/4d237f00f5a740d586766177f47be9fc.png"><br><br>  And also from November 13 to 15, the hackathon <a href="http://hack4people.ru/">‚ÄúBlockchain.</a>  <a href="http://hack4people.ru/">Fintech: Be a pioneer! ‚Äù</a>  The hackathon is organized within the framework of promoting the FinNet theme of the National Technology Initiative, supervised by ASI, HSE.Lab - Center for HSE Prototyping.  This competition is for start-up teams creating their products in FinTech with a focus on blockchain. <br><br>  The hackathon organizers invite programmers, developers, financiers and marketers to the 48 hour marathon to create working prototypes of blockchain systems, blockchain applications and other financial products. <br><br>  Who wanted the project for a couple of days, as well as valuable prizes and even more valuable dating?  You have a direct road to the hackathon! <br><br>  That's all for now.  As you see, fintech in Russia is only gaining momentum, investments are being made, communities, incubators with accelerators, training courses, hackathons and other events are being organized.  Blockchain is perceived not as something ephemeral-theoretical, but as a working basis for financial products.  So stay tuned!  I also try to keep an up-to-date list of Russian-language events in <a href="https://forum.bits.media/index.php%3F/topic/967-offlain-meropriiatiia-russkoiazychnogo-fintekh-i-blockchain/%3Fp%3D11645">this thread of the</a> forum, it can sometimes be useful to drop in there. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/366885/">https://habr.com/ru/post/366885/</a></p>
