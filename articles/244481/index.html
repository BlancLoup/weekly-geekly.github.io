  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A few words about working at home</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this short article I want to write a few words about how I personally divided and organized my workplace at home.  I have very little experience in remote work, so consider this text simply as a description of a couple of interesting ideas from personal experience that may also be useful to you. <br><br>  I will not pour a lot of water and go straight to the tips. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Create two spaces: working and recreational </h4><br>  To make it easier to switch from work mode to rest mode.  This tip is also mentioned in the book <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/217611/">Remote</a> .  Personally, I did it in the following simple way: I have two operating systems installed on my computer.  The first is Windows 8, in which I rest: surf the Internet, make my videos, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DGFvNV70ikHU%26feature%3Dyoutu.be">try to drive</a> Richard Burns in the rally.  Sometimes there is a hard time there, but life is generally difficult. <br><br>  The second OS is Kubuntu 14.04.  Here we have everything created for convenient and productive work.  No Richard Burns.  I created six different desktops, each of which is designed for its own task, and between which I can quickly switch through hotkeys.  Here I write code for projects, here I have a browser next to me with a bunch of tabs for current work, terminal windows are open on a separate desktop, and so on.  In general, when I go into Linux, the whole working atmosphere speaks for itself: jokes aside.  It's time to work.

    <h4>  Workplace </h4><br>  There are just a couple of little tips.  They are applicable, by the way, to ordinary offices. <br><br><h5>  About the thing we are sitting on </h5><br>  I think everyone knows this feeling when working in a chair you have only two options: join your desk and computer and work in that position, keeping your back in tension for several hours.  To give your back a rest, use the second option: recline on the back of the chair and relax.  Usually, another option is not offered due to the fact that you can not bring your chair sufficiently to the table to work simultaneously and let your back rest.  Yes, and the design of the seats usually does not imply a similar approach. <br><br>  So, the solution to the problem is to buy a chair that will support your posture.  Personally, I found myself a beautiful and cheap <a href="http://www.ikea.com/ru/ru/catalog/products/40214117/">chair in Ikea</a> , on which I am now writing this article.  Believe it or not, even though it looks rather stupid and ridiculous, but of all the chairs and chairs for which I worked in my life, this one is the simplest and most convenient.  In addition, it seems, he is also the cheapest in the entire directory.  He does not have armrests, so my hands are located on the table in front of the keyboard, and the chair itself, at the same time, almost completely enters under the table, so I can easily lean on his back and hardly strain my back during work.  And its back is just designed in a design that maintains the correct posture.  And still, when you sit on it, it is funny spring. <br><br>  PS For the office, this chair is not too good, since it is still not very comfortable for prolonged sitting for 8-9 hours. <br><br><h5>  Monitor at eye level </h5><br>  Or just below this level, as advised in many recommendations.  This will reduce the strain on your eyes, and also contribute to the development of correct posture.  Personally, I used for this purpose the second volume of the schoolboy‚Äôs handbook for grades 5-11, as well as the first volume of the large school encyclopedia.  Books are thick and wide, just suitable for putting a monitor on them and bringing its height to eye level.  Recommend. <br><br>  Also a list of articles on this topic, which were shared in the comments by <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/olartamonov/" class="user_link">olartamonov</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/lastdragon/" class="user_link">LastDragon</a> . <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hidden text</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg36.pdf">British recommendations</a> <br><blockquote>  "The forearms should be approximately the same as the height of the screen" or " <i>Forearms should be approximately in a horizontal position</i> and the user's eyes should be at the same height as the <i>upper part of the screen</i> ." </blockquote><br></li><li>  <a href="http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/ergonomics/office/monitor_positioning.html">Canadian</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.apple.com/about/ergonomics/vision.html">Apple</a> <br><blockquote>  "Position your monitor at the <i>right height,</i> " or " <i>Position the monitor at the desired</i> height, at or just below eye level." </blockquote><br></li><li>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/support/healthy-computing-guide">Microsoft</a> <br><blockquote>  "Position the screen near the eye level" or " <i>Position the top of the screen at eye level</i> ." </blockquote><br></li><li>  <a href="http://www.vseoglazah.ru/eye-diseases/computer-vision-syndrome/">An article from an ophthalmologist about the problem of computer visual syndrome</a> <br><blockquote>  " <i>The center of the monitor should be located below the horizontal line of gaze by 10-25 cm at the optimum working distance to the monitor 50-70 cm</i> ." </blockquote><br></li></ul><br></div></div><br><br><h4>  Schedule </h4><br>  Personally, I divided my work schedule into sections of 2-3 hours, during which I was engaged <b>exclusively in</b> work.  That is, when one of these intervals begins, I begin to firmly stop all my impulses to enter the social network, video service and instant messenger, and start idling there idle, as we all love to do.  As a rule, sustaining 2-3 hours of continuous work is not so difficult.  After that, you can take a break: take a break for something, take a shower or take a walk.  After some time, having rested, you can enter your next working segment. <br><br>  I will not write a lot, I just wanted to share with other people a couple of useful tips.  Hope this will benefit someone.  And all the best to you, my dear habr-users. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/244481/">https://habr.com/ru/post/244481/</a></p>
