The year 0x7DD will not be an exception.  So, this information is for you - senior students and graduate students!  We offer everyone to spend summertime exciting and useful, gaining new knowledge and translating it directly into the program code! <br>  <b>Application deadline extended to May 12th.</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Step one.  We are interested and choose the field of activity </h4>  The rules for admission to summer schools (and, traditionally, there are only two - in Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk) have not undergone any changes, only the terms have shifted slightly.  Not even the address of the page <a href="http://www3.intel.com/cd/corporate/education/emea/rus/471955.htm">on the Intel site</a> has been changed, which tells about schools.  On this page you will find a <a href="http://cache-www.intel.com/cd/00/00/52/12/521286_521286.pdf">list of tasks</a> that will be solved during the training period.  By <b>May 12</b> (very little time is left!), Those who wish to enroll must send <a href="http://cache-www.intel.com/cd/00/00/52/12/521287_521287.pdf">their questionnaire</a> to the specified e-mail address, as well as a plan to solve any of the presented tasks in a free form. <br><br>  This year's tasks are 48:27 for a school in Nizhny Novgorod and 21 for Novosibirsk.  All of them relate to topics that are relevant to Intel: media processing, computer graphics, programming tools, parallel programming technologies, high-performance math libraries, etc. I will try to choose the most interesting of them - to interest you. <br><br>  <b>Task 8. Improve open media libraries by integrating the Intel Media SDK to perform decoding and encoding.</b> <br>  Open source media libraries are often used in commercial products.  It is proposed to build the Intel Media SDK library into one of these open libraries in order to get a performance boost of this library when launched on the Intel platform.

      <b>Task 14. Development / optimization of analytical algorithms for big data analysis</b> <br>  The project consists of several stages: high-level comparative analysis of some algorithms for data analysis;  selection, development of algorithms in the C language and their analysis in terms of scalability in terms of data size, as well as available hardware resources (length of the vector register, number of cores, etc.);  optimization of algorithms for Intel architectures using Intel's C / C ++ compiler, Intel MKL library, etc .;  writing a report that summarizes the results of the analysis, conclusions and recommendations. <br><br>  <b>Task 22. Analysis of the performance / power consumption of applications for Intel mobile platforms (Android, Win 8).</b> <br>  Participation in a project to support the launch of Intel platforms for mobile devices.  Analysis of performance / power consumption of applications, validation of applications.  OS: Android, Win8. <br><br>  <b>Task 27. Development of sign and voice interfaces to geographic information or graphic applications</b> <br>  Popular geo-information applications (Yandex Maps, Google Maps, ...) or graphic editors (Photoshop, GIMP) have a rather heavyweight, mouse-oriented user interface.  Objective: to select 2-3 applications among the popular graphic or geographic information;  develop a draft interface that allows you to naturally manage the application using both hands and voice capabilities;  develop an interface module based on the PerC SDK, which implements the concept of the interface and allows you to control the application in an alternative way;  create a package of demo applications. <br><br>  Naturally, all those who are seriously interested should carefully examine the entire proposed list of tasks - what if there is exactly what you have long wanted to do?  I emphasize that all tasks are absolutely real, the results will be further used in the work of Intel. <br><br><h4>  Step two.  We are waiting for the conclusion of the expert committee </h4>  Within a month, <b>from May 1 to June 1</b> , all submitted applications are examined by experts, and interviews are held with suitable candidates.  The selection results are sent to contestants and posted on the Intel website <b>on June 4th</b> .  I have no doubt that if you seriously work at the first stage (let me remind you once again - there is not much time left!), Then your name will surely be on the list of students. <br>  I want to draw your attention: the initial choice of the problem does not necessarily coincide with the final distribution of the projects. <br><br><h4>  Step three.  Packing Suitcases </h4>  All further information you will receive from the Intel coordinators by mail or by phone.  During the internship, a scholarship is paid, non-resident interns are given a grant to travel from school to school and back, as well as accommodation in a student dormitory. <br>  Classes in schools will be held <b>from July 3 to August 23</b> . <br>  The best students who have successfully completed an internship will receive an advantageous opportunity to work at Intel during their studies as interns and after graduation as full-time employees. <br><br>  I sincerely wish good luck to all who made the decision to try their hand.  And for those who will study at the Intel 0x7DD Summer School, I sincerely wish to write a small report about what they saw and send it to our Intel blog - as <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/151379/">one of the participants</a> did <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/151379/">last year</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/177837/">https://habr.com/ru/post/177837/</a></p>
