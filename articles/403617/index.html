As a result, in the absence of other topics for discussion, people discuss what is constantly before their eyes: the course of the PLBT token.  There seems to be a reason to talk: while in the course of ICO, Polybius tokens were sold at a fixed rate of $ 10, then after going to an open sale on cryptobirds in July, he sank several times in price, starting to return to normal only in August.  Now the Polybius token is trading at about $ 6-7.  But still, we see that the volume of daily token trading on stock exchanges varies from 1-5% of the total capitalization of PLBT, that is, the majority of its owners are not in a hurry to ‚Äúdump‚Äù it.  And there is no panic in words - the Polybius global token-holder community behaves very restrained.  To understand why this is happening, we will take a look at the situation through their eyes and talk about what is happening, their words. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Why the fall in the rate of the token did not scare anyone </h3><br>  First, tokens actually cost less than $ 10 to most users, because during the pre-sale and the first four weeks of the ICO they were released with bonuses, so the weighted average price of tokens sold is only $ 8.67. <br><cut></cut><br>  Secondly, the fall in the PLBT rate is largely due to the ‚Äúdumping‚Äù of bounty tokens (tokens received as remuneration) - i.e.  people who did not pay for them at all a penny.  The rest of tokens are perfectly aware of this, as can be seen, for example, in the <a href="https://t.me/polybius_eng">English-language Telegram-chat</a> "Polybius" ( <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/6btm2c/coins_crashing_in_value_after_ico_success/">1</a> , <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php%3Ftopic%3D2107940.0">2</a> ). <br><br>  <i>As practice shows, the tokens allocated to the bounty program are not the first time going sideways with different ICOs.</i>  <i>On the one hand, by announcing a reward for supporting the project on specialized platforms and in social networks, one can increase the involvement of the crypto community.</i>  <i>On the other hand, it is obvious that the recipients of the bounty are the least motivated in the "game of the long."</i>  <i>The fall of the token rate only motivates them to ‚Äúreset‚Äù it as soon as possible, receiving any money, while token holders who paid for the token with a crypt and fiat money can and will weigh the pros and cons of participating in a ‚Äúdump‚Äù against the game ‚Äúin the long‚Äù - especially in the case of "Polybius" tokens.</i>

      Under the terms of the ICO, 2% of the total number of tokens put into circulation were sent to remuneration under the Polybius bounty program.  From the moment PLBT went public, the tokens' daily trading volume ranged from <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/ru/markets/livecoin/plbt-eth-all.html">100,000 to $ 1 million,</a> with a total token capitalization ranging from $ 11.6 to $ 39.5 million.  If you look at both of these processes <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/assets/polybius/">over time</a> , it becomes clear that most of the PLBT movements on stock exchanges roughly coincide with the share of bounty paid, with the allowable correction for that portion of token buyers, who, unfortunately, decided that a drop in the rate is a signal to panic and fixing the loss. <br><br>  The other part of the tokens holders, on the contrary, took it as an opportunity to increase the PLBT portfolio at an extremely profitable exchange rate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/cc4/382/436/cc43824369b64b288eec8de727f280e0.jpg"><br><br>  This trend continues: while some sell Polybius tokens at a price below par, others use this as an opportunity to buy them more and cheaper.  As a result, the token bidding volumes, which reached a peak of $ 1 million, have now dropped by more than an order of magnitude: the minimum daily PLBT trading volume of about $ 20,000 has been reached, and at the time of publication of the article, the bidding went <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/assets/polybius/">at about $ 110,000</a> with a total capitalization ~ $ 23 million. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/68c/007/4a6/68c0074a668979397f2ae7731d92e3dc.png" alt="image"><br><br>  That is, long-term investors not only did not lose interest in the Polybius tokens, but also collected almost all the ‚Äúfree‚Äù tokens from the market, virtually destroying the short-term speculative interest disappeared.  Life itself confirmed the loyalty of our initial calculations about the nature of the fall of the PLBT course, outlined on July 28 in the article <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/polybius/blog/291515/">‚ÄúLife after ICO: how Polybius is doing now</a> . <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/polybius/blog/291515/">‚Äù</a> <br><br>  What is the basis of the confidence of those who are buying them now, and of the huge mass of those who are in no hurry to sell them? <br><br><h3>  Tokens are not on time, but with good intentions. </h3><br>  The usual model of earning on ICO is purely short-term: bought on a hype, on a hype higher - sold.  That's just the office of the European regulator can not run in with a shout: "Rather, give us a banking license, WE FALL IN OUR TKENS."  And thank God.  For ICO participants, this should not have been news: how much and why the process of obtaining a license of a financial institution in Europe is fundamental and time consuming, we began to write from the very first articles of the series <a href="https://geektimes.ru/search/%3Fq%3D%255B%25D1%2587%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%2520%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%2520%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%2520%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%2520%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%258C%255D%26target_type%3Dposts">‚ÄúHow to open your bank in Europe‚Äù</a> . <br><br>  <a href="https://t.me/polybius_eng">The English-speaking community</a> constantly reminds us that it is possible to say something concrete about our project, its payback period and dividends from tokens only in six months or a year, not earlier.  All other attempts to sell tokens profitably on the stock exchange are doomed to failure in advance, since now the demand is overheated by the cheap offer of the participants of the bounty program, dropping ‚Äúfree‚Äù PLBT tokens. <br><br>  The average "Polybius" tokenholder has strong nerves and a solid reserve of patience.  Some also bought popcorn so that it would be boring to watch the throwings of those who expected the explosive growth of the PLBT rate and quick money. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/6af/49d/7e6/6af49d7e682044048d9eda5be7893741.jpg"><br><br>  There is quite a bit of discussion in those who openly say that they ‚Äúfroze‚Äù, as skeptical holders like to express themselves, their money for a period of one to five years. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b6d/dce/46a/b6ddce46ae8b45628a84be2fdb2c8eab.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/989/3e1/6b4/9893e16b4fc14a1fa56b55bd8ad9295c.png"><br><br>  What else do the ICO members in English who have some experience of participating in various projects think of Polybius?  We talked with some of them and asked what they thought about the Polybius Bank project and panic around the fall in the rate of tokens after the end of the fundraising. <br><br>  <b>Jay Meta, the tokenholder and moderator of the English channel Polybius in the Telegram:</b> <br><br><blockquote>  The development of the project and development are, in my opinion, smooth.  In the fall, we, the holders of tokens, are waiting for a lot of news: a new CEO, a detailed development plan, a physical location for Polybius Bank. <br><br>  I completely trust the project team and keep the tokens with me.  Polybius Bank is a long-term project and, unlike other ICOs, it is not limited to the digital part only.  Therefore, it takes time. </blockquote><br>  <b>Michael Jalloh, Polybius project tokenholder:</b> <br><br><blockquote>  Now the price of Polybius tokens is low, but this should not disturb the project participants and cause panic.  Because the whole idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãPolybius revolves around creating a bank.  While there is no bank, then the PLBT token is expected to be worth nothing, there is nothing to support its value.  But I think that when the bank starts to function, it will become what provides the value of PLBT and supports its course, will give importance. <br><br>  When a bank is created and dividends are paid to holders of tokens, the price of PLBT will go up. </blockquote><br>  <b>Damaz, Polybius project tokenholder:</b> <br><br><blockquote>  I do not understand the current panic around the PLBT token rate.  How can you deal with, conditionally, investing and at the same time be so impatient?  Creating a bank is not a quick process, so I prefer to control myself and wait for news from the team. </blockquote><br>  <b>Schid Marx, Polybius project tokenholder:</b> <br><br><blockquote> I think many people just do not understand that Polybius is a long-term investment.  Now they are complaining about the rate of the token or have invested more than they could afford, and therefore panic because of the prospect of losses in the short term.  The majority of those who are dissatisfied are short-term traders who jumped on a train called Polybius in the wake of the HYIP, in the hope of quickly making a profit, but in the end got disappointed.  Impatience, fear and thirst for quick money in the main and form their thinking. <br><br>  The rules of doing business are the same for all areas, and cryptography is no exception.  Most enterprises close in the first year of their existence, and, as a tokenholder, you must weigh the pros and cons, engage in team research, evaluate competitors.  Polybius clearly stated in its ‚ÄúProspectus‚Äù and ‚Äúroad map‚Äù that they will exist as a registered bank, for example, in Lithuania, and it needs to get a physical place of deployment.  Anytime, anywhere, if you are dealing with government officials and the government, the process is going on ridiculously slow.  There is also a package of regulatory documents that must go through various offices, and this process takes weeks and months.  And this is without taking into account the fact that Polybius is not a traditional bank.  That is, any clerk who processes the documentation can stall the process due to his misunderstanding of cryptography and how it will work in general. <br><br>  When I went to Polybius, I took all these factors into account and invested no more than I can afford.  And I am even ready not to see my investments during the year.  The project team, in fact, does not know how to manage a bank, so it is now engaged in hiring the right people, and this was discussed from the very beginning.  I believe that the general director of the bank will be announced in September. <br><br>  In any case, events may progress faster or slower.  As an ICO member, you must take these risks.  If you look at Stratis, it took THREE YEARS to grow from $ 0.01 to $ 6.00 +.  Now, when more and more people are interested in cryptography, I believe that this period will be reduced by half, to 1.5 years.  I believe in the Polybius team, and I believe in the Polybius Bank.  And when they bring the project to a working condition, it will change the world.  But, like everything else, it will take time. </blockquote><br>  <b>Rational Dreamer, Polybius Tokenholder:</b> <br><br><blockquote>  I believe that most people who buy cryptographic tokens expect immediate return after the end of the ICO, and panic has spread among many PLBT holders because the rate is now $ 6.53, that is, below the level of sales at ICO.  However, I invested with an eye to the long term and do not intend to sell my tokens.  In fact, I am very pleased with this panic among token-holders with "weak hands" who drop their tokens and roll the price ... This allows me to buy more PLBT at a substantial discount.  I think that the cost of a PLBT token is seriously undervalued, and there are cunning people who know about it and deliberately stir up panic, spread rumors.  This is done then, then to buy tokens cheaper. <br><br>  What else do I like about Polybius, but no offense: its founders are businessmen whose goal is to turn one penny into five, only on a different scale.  When I looked at the Polybius Prospectus, I figured that they would be able to do this with far fewer resources than other crypto banks.  This is a good sign for the holder of tokens.  As they say in my homeland: "Who can work effectively with less investment will earn more and more."  Polybius reminds me of Vista Equity Partners.  Vista and their CEO for a long time could not make their way onto the world stage and were losing money for years, and now they have $ 30 billion in investments. </blockquote><br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/polybius/blog/291515/">Recall</a> that we have already told you what the Polybius team will do and will do in the near future: signing contracts with the leadership of a future bank, choosing a jurisdiction for obtaining a license, hiring employees, etc.  This is all a slow process, but true.  And we are grateful to those who not only were with us in the course of the ICO, but also continue to support us when labor days have replaced the HYIP. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> All the people in the screenshots are more than real and you can talk to them <a href="https://t.me/polybius_eng">in the official Telegram channel</a> Polybius. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403617/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403617/</a></p>
