Each tip is based on my personal experience.  For each advice I could give a guarantee if the guarantee for advice was possible in principle. <br><br>  Entry is over, go to the tips! <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <strong>1. Record everything.</strong>  Do not try to keep everything in your head.  Pour them on paper or planner.  The less thoughts in your mind about outstanding cases, the more you are able to focus on the current task and the better you can accomplish it.  This is the basic principle of the world-famous <a href="http://www.bookmate.com/books/JHxD4t8n">GTD</a> methodology.

      <strong>2. Do the most important thing first.</strong>  It seems to be simple.  But in practice it turns out that we are often busy with not the most important things, postponing important things for later.  Try this: get up in the morning, perform all the <a href="http://lifenavigator.ru/razrabotayte-utrenniy-ritual-i-delayte-ego-kazhdyiy-den">morning rituals</a> and do the most important things for 2-3 hours.  What drives you towards <em>your</em> goals. <br><br>  <strong>3. Make a plan for the day in the evening.</strong>  Do not postpone for the morning!  Very simple advice, but it really helps not to get bogged down in unimportant matters, to focus on the essentials and to set priorities correctly. <br><br>  <strong>4. Discard paper media.</strong>  Keep all records, all affairs, all projects in electronic form.  This saves time and allows (if your files are properly organized) to get quick access to the necessary data.  I use <a href="http://culturedcode.com/">Things</a> .  Over the past 7 years, I have tried a bunch of software, but this program has conquered me so much that for more than a year and a half I have been using it.  I even bought an iPhone just because of it :) <br><br>  <strong>5. Use <a href="http://dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> .</strong>  This is a service to synchronize your files on all your digital devices.  Now it is difficult to imagine how much time I was losing earlier simply due to the fact that I didn‚Äôt have all the necessary files at hand. <br><br>  <strong>6. Use mind mapping.</strong>  What it is?  This is a whole paradigm of thinking.  Its use increases productivity tenfold.  This is not an exaggeration.  Once I was shocked, just reading in the preface to the book ‚Äú <a href="http://www.bookmate.com/books/QAIQdhq4">Supermind</a> ‚Äù a list of what the authors of this technique (and the book), the Busen brothers, managed to do and accomplish in their lives.  Briefly and clearly about the mind mapping can be read in a <a href="http://kolesnik.ru/2005/mindmapping/">very sensible note Vitaly Kolesnik</a> . <br><br>  <strong>7. Save even seconds when working at the computer.</strong>  They run into minutes and hours.  A simple example.  How do most people use a computer?  Mouse (or touchpad) + keyboard.  For most actions, we use the cursor, and on the keyboard we use to type text and numbers.  Few people know that hotkeys, hotkeys, are provided for almost all actions in the operating system and programs.  Proved that it is much more efficient than the constant use of the cursor.  It is not necessary to know them all, it is enough to start small, and your work with a computer will become more efficient.  Here is a <a href="http://ergosolo.ru/reviews/hotkeys/hotkeys3/">list of such combinations for Windows</a> . <br><br>  <strong>8. Learn the blind 10-finger print method.</strong>  Yes, take it and learn.  Programs and service simulators are now the sea!  If your work is connected with a computer, you will save tens of minutes, or even hours, every day! <br><br>  <strong>9. Strive for mono-task.</strong>  Do not try to do everything at once.  Choose a task, remove distractions (colleagues, social networks, Skype, ICQ, mail, Internet) and just do it.  Read more <a href="http://www.bookmate.com/books/AJCOae5n">in the book by Timothy Ferris</a> . <br><br>  <strong>10. Get up early.</strong>  Ancient as the world, advice that allows millions of people around the world to do a lot every day. <br><br>  <strong>11. Play sports or at least exercise.</strong>  This will help keep your body in the right shape, which means your mind and spirit will work more efficiently. <br><br>  <strong>12. Eliminate ‚Äúno deeds‚Äù from your to-do list.</strong>  Let your plan be only that which can be taken and done without thinking.  For example, ‚Äústarting a new project‚Äù is not the case.  This is a project.  But "to define the project objectives for 2 months" - this is more like a case.  It‚Äôs even better if you have specific actions on your list. <br><br>  <strong>13. For each task, indicate the time you allot to it.</strong>  There is even a whole technique with the funny name ‚ÄúPomodoro‚Äù, <a href="http://tim.com.ua/2009/10/pomodoro-technique/">read more about it here</a> . <br><br>  <strong>14. Ignore the unimportant.</strong>  You have no idea how much extra time you will free yourself, just ignoring everything that can be ignored. <br><br>  <strong>15. Be proactive.</strong>  Do not react, and determine what to do and what to bolt.  Yes, ‚Äúproactiveness‚Äù is a term from the books of Stephen Covey.  Read more <a href="http://www.yourfreedom.ru/7-navykov-vysokoeffektivnoj-lichnosti/">here</a> . <br><br>  <strong>16. Save files right where they belong.</strong>  To do this, you need, of course, the file storage system, which will help create a GTD.  For example, do not be lazy to write in the phone book the necessary contacts.  It is convenient for future search and processing. <br><br>  <strong>17. Change your activities.</strong>  The longer you do the same thing, the lower your productivity.  Change the picture and type of activity several times a day.  This will help to maintain a fresh look and high creative potential. <br><br>  And the most important thing.  Do not forget why you do all this.  Do not forget to live! <br><br>  What is the point in productivity, if there is no time for real life, for cinema, books, friends, relatives and close ones, travel, walks and rest?  Keep your spiritual and material goals in focus and avoid imbalances.  Live harmoniously and be happy!  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129310/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129310/</a></p>
