Built by Megaphone (this data center will soon also become a hosting site)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In early November, Megafon-Volga region invited 15 bloggers from Samara to tour their data center (it is currently the largest among all commercial data centers in Russia).  I became one of those 15.  I do not work in a megaphone. <br><br>  The data center was opened on October 8, 2010. The investment in the project is 900 million rubles.  <a href="http://volga.corp.megafon.ru/press/information/20101008-1416.html">There is a press release</a> , there are a number of technical characteristics.  Built this data center for 2 years. <br><br>  On the territory of the data center with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã6,912 square meters.  m. there are 6 auto-halls with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã400 m2, electric power plants and a control center.  There are 6 floors in the building (though only the 1st and 5th are working so far, plus there are no autochambers on the 5th - only meeting rooms and the Monitoring Control Center).

      The exterior of this 6-story building is futuristic: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/fe34100a/f63245f5/b62f2178/139a4194.jpg"><br><br>  The data center is located 20 km from the city of Samara, there used to be forests there, now IKEA has been built nearby (as much as 3 years ago, but it will not be put into operation).  Megaphone bought 3-4 hectares of land, and if you need to expand even more, you can attach another building next to the data center in this area. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the data center now work 60 hours (but of course at one point in time all the 60s are not there, because someone has a day off, someone has a different shift). <br><br>  The data center was built in accordance with the international standard EIA / TIA-492 "Standard for the telecommunications infrastructure of data centers."  The project meets all requirements of the standard.  This detached building, remote from residential buildings, is located in a non-flooded area.  It provides 100% redundancy in energy supply (2 independent inputs of electricity), provides a high load-carrying capacity of floors - up to 5,000 kg / m2., A modern fire extinguishing system is in place, safe for client equipment, 24-hour security is provided.  On the territory there are 2 backup diesel generators (in the form of vans).  If the electricity in both channels disappears, within 90 seconds everything is powered from the batteries, and during the same 90 seconds the diesel generators go to the required power and the power supply starts to flow from these diesel generators.  In general, there will be no problem with electricity anyway. <br><br>  The preliminary conclusion of the Uptime Institute on the compliance of the data center with the TIER III reliability level has been received.  In early 2011, the corresponding certificate will be received.  Experts in the stories said that if it were not for the airport at 25 km from the data center, he would receive a fourth level of reliability, and not the third. <br><br>  Center network bandwidth is up to 200 Gbit / s. <br><br>  With its own large-scale transport network in the Volga region and throughout Russia, MegaFon guarantees the most reliable FOCL transmission and additional reservation of channels.  Fiber-optic lines are connected by different routes, which provides additional channel redundancy in the event of a break. <br><br>  The data center even has a pair of its wells for water extraction. <br><br>  In general, a great place for cloud hosting. <br><br>  MegaFon plans to provide collocation services (host third-party servers) in this data center.  But only volumes from one rack and above (that is, one server will not be put in there).  Interested in contacting MegaFon‚Äôs corporate clients department.  The press release says that Megafon is also going to be engaged in hosting (according to rumors - including virtual hosting). <br><br>  This data center is the first of the network of data centers that Megfon plans to build throughout the country. <br><br><h4>  Report from the tour </h4><br><br>  The excursion took place on November 13, on Saturday (it was a working day in Russia).  At 16-00, near the central office of MegaFon, we were loaded into a minibus and taken to the data center.  At the beginning of the way we were given printed press releases (the first link in the post) and boot covers.  We drove for about an hour (because we got into traffic jams). <br><br>  At the checkpoint at the gate, each of us checked passports, and let inside. <br><br>  Uptime is provided even at the Christmas trees next to the building!  (strong winds blow there) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/d0c69680/31018f4e/3e00e649/dbe8aade.jpg"><br><br>  What is a little saddened - the wifi inside the data center is paid (‚Äúmegaphone-wifi‚Äù), obviously because YET, there is no one besides MegaFon employees in the data center. <br><br>  At the entrance, specially trained robots put shoe covers on any parts of the body that are tucked into them.  Because there is no place for dirt and dust in the data center.  Smoking in the data center is also impossible, for this you have to go out. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/eb05688f/fd6c19b0/1285ca5f/e72df530.jpg"><br><br>  Megafon employees who conducted bloggers on the data center and talk about it (CTO - on the left in the picture).  They are also in shoe covers. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/28ded435/9ef88405/f7c7d570/9ac417c2.jpg"><br><br>  Excursions + 2 girls of Megaphone: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/b27cbe6e/423ea3f9/3c5fd824/50ca05e7.jpg"><br><br>  Entrance to the first machine hall <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/1ea13ea7/344c3c5d/17b0e11f/dd485c1f.jpg"><br><br>  In the operating machine.  One half of the machine room is empty - so there is even room on this floor for collocation customers.  And there are 4 more such floors with machines (but they are still being finished).  Fire extinguishing systems are hanging from the ceiling. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/fa466316/ccde0010/3591f4f4/9f373c83.jpg"><br><br>  Then we went to the half of the hall, where there are racks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/0773c2d7/e0ac927f/bcaceeb2/e2aab990.jpg"><br><br>  Inside the machine hall there is unreal noise due to ventilation systems and server operation, you can only talk while standing 1 meter away from a person. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/9b3a9f8c/0724ad0e/ea16de2d/bd37261d.jpg"><br><br>  Bloggers continued to actively photograph everything. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/0c2ec5fd/8533808e/d767297c/2283da21.jpg"><br><br>  According to engineers, more than 50% of computers are under Unix-like operating systems (and what did you want!).  There is solaris, there is hpux, there is Linux.  And a DBMS in Megaphone - Orakl. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/7eecba3d/fe3069f5/1466c59c/91e3379d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/34e8b233/2a7769cf/3a96ef8f/420c268e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/1a2c40b4/0069a64f/65d408dc/dc1eae77.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/81fdddf3/8da90e68/a4ca181c/a395ad1f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/e1f8629f/fe7efcb4/8375dfb0/11f72c3c.jpg"><br><br>  Raised his hand with a fotikom and sfotkal this machine hall: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/54110ace/a564d9d7/d859fb64/975d37a8.jpg"><br><br>  Again in the empty half of the turbine hall.  Fire extinguishing systems are visible on the ceiling. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/831645a4/0ab531f9/483ec57e/03042a2f.jpg"><br><br>  Here is a facade near the building.  Holes through - for the return of heat. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/fa11947f/b0453882/135476c2/001688fe.jpg"><br><br>  "Room of third-party operators" on the 5th floor. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/feb190ae/82ecf1f1/c0b15f66/db971ffc.jpg"><br><br>  Then we went to the monitoring control center on the 5th floor. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/50a7822b/74a60861/28873aed/492d3344.jpg"><br><br>  There is a huge screen on the whole wall.  The 28 projectors behind it display various information on the processes occurring in the Megafon equipment in several cities of the Volga region <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/8b12744e/1b787413/79e75a48/c8ef934c.jpg"><br><br>  Screen content <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/dda91420/5803a95f/2dc0448c/4a2c8a4d.jpg"><br><br>  It seems one shows the amount of traffic passing through the cellular network, depending on the time of day. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/f87e3049/94224819/3fe3ded1/e1f7fb71.jpg"><br><br>  Here is the structure of the own network of Megafon channels and it seems that traffic in each of the cities of the Volga region is from the time of day. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/6de91096/a503c47f/2d7052e2/6e1f1b42.jpg"><br><br>  On all computers that were in TSUM - Windows.  But some are used as terminal clients for calling Unixes - on some screens you could see windows written in Motif. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/d9adca85/76c4de95/84d87d54/e29d68c8.jpg"><br><br>  Then we were taken to a separate room and showed a movie about the data center (3D model of the building, terrain, etc.).  Unfortunately, according to the company's PR service, this video will never be online. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/66d03b1e/65c97c50/dfb5e3af/67c36bf2.jpg"><br><br>  After the video was shown, we were taken to a snack in the dining room for all data center employees.  There is a fridge and microwave. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/da448679/893feb5f/bbe3453c/e5b3cca2.jpg"><br><br>  And in the process, we continued to communicate with Megafon employees who conducted this excursion for us. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/3d8b7da1/78beb968/e7cf2128/21e419f6.jpg"><br><br>  After that, MegaFon employees handed each bag with memorable gifts - a mug, a ball, and even a ‚Äúflying alarm clock‚Äù - everything is branded. <br><br>  After that, they took me back to the central office of Megaphone. <br><br>  Everything was perfectly organized and unrealistically cognitive (the largest commercial data center in Russia, however), many thanks to Megaphone for this excursion, and to all the staff who had a hand in its organization. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108452/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108452/</a></p>
