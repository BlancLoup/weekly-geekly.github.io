The choice fell on a simple <i>Nokia 2630</i> .  And a <i>macbook</i> is available.  It would be necessary to sort out notebooks from phone to phone.  But having more than five hundred contacts with a bunch of data in each, neither copying through a SIM card will save, nor throwing away business cards one by one via bluetooth - this option will be very dreary. <br>  So a volitional decision was made to pervert to the fullest. <br><br><h2>  I made a plan like this: </h2><br><ol><li>  Drop all the notes from <i>SE w950i</i> on <i>MacBook</i> ; </li><li>  There, it should be properly put in order, information should be added to contacts (such as IM, e-mail, birthday, etc.), combed everything and get rid of debris and ‚Äúcorpses‚Äù; </li><li>  Pour the resulting on both mobile phones and in the address book of the <i>gmail-</i> ovskogo box; </li><li>  Enjoy the result!  ;-) </li></ol><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  1. Exporting a notebook to a MacBook ... </h2><br>  ... turned out to be the easiest and fastest of our plans.  We make a backup of the notebook, getting a <i>vcf-</i> file at the output.  File we throw on the beacon on the poppy, click on it and get the offer to import all these contacts into the poppy <i>Address Book</i> : <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5e9/bb0/027/5e9bb00277cb1cfc4b628d72ed48ec73.png" width="470" height="145" alt="Picture 1"><br>  We agree.  Everything, it is possible to pass to the second point.

    <h2>  2. We put in order the notebook </h2><br>  Over time, each person has their own habits in terms of storing and organizing information.  Someone is satisfied with a complete mess, someone strives for absolute ideals, a la "each file has its own place."  I, like most users, somewhere in the middle, i.e.  sometimes I feel that everything!  Stop!  it's time to clear the Augean stables.  But you need to do it with the least effort.  For laziness.  So, the first step in favor of laziness is made: it is much more convenient to edit names-phone-mails on Big Brother behind a full-fledged keyboard than to wield with a stylus or press tiny buttons on a phone. <br>  The point is the second optimization: let's create a template. <br><br>  I made myself this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cab/24a/6a2/cab24a6a2411481566284e558b9ebf79.png" width="405" height="504" alt="Picture 2"><br>  And it took a few hours of careful copy-and-pasteing, renaming and additions: birthdays, URLs, jabberes, skype (the latter, however, had to be added to <i>Notes</i> ) ... <br><br>  Uff! .. Everything!  Hooray!  Pleasure to watch.  For the sake of completeness, you can also get another widget from the standard delivery on the <i>Dashboard</i> : <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/658/858/753/658858753705e93ebf47ea3e831d20bb.png" width="288" height="88" alt="Picture 3"><br>  Damn, so that I used to use addressbooks on my computer in the ‚ÄúWindows‚Äù or ‚ÄúLinux‚Äù times!  Yes, no zhist!  And here I constantly use it because it is convenient and very fast. <br><br><h2>  3. Total synchronization </h2><br>  Here we come to the point, because of which this article, in fact, was started.  As you remember, we need to synchronize notebooks with three ‚Äúdevices‚Äù.  And with each I caught at least one rake. <br><br><h3>  3.1 SE w950i </h3><br>  Once the <i>Address Book has</i> perfectly eaten what the smartphone has provided to him, then, in theory, everything should be fine and go back.  I delete all contacts from the smart note.  I export all the notes from the poppy into a single <i>vcf</i> file: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c28/e12/f4f/c28e12f4f4bff78414358c30460143f6.png" width="535" height="256" alt="Picture 4"><br>  Smart as well as the <i>Address Book of the</i> first paragraph, offers to throw all contacts into the depths of your notebook.  He thinks long and painfully and gives out: ‚Äúthe file is corrupted!‚Äù.  I try to repeat the operation several times - the result is unchanged. <br>  I remember that somewhere I saw <i>iSync</i> application - I connect a smart one through it.  The synchronization process begins, which ends with an allert that 17 contacts (and each time are different!) Could not be transferred.  I was looking for a long time where the dog rummaged, it turned out that <i>vCard</i> 's should be exported in the format of version 2.1, and not in the 3rd, as I had configured by default: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7cf/725/45d/7cf72545d391d3d478d0b726717150cd.png" width="541" height="361" alt="Picture 5"><br>  The first is ready. <br><br><h3>  3.2 Nokia 2630 </h3><br>  And just a bummer!  Nokia doesn‚Äôt want to understand a multi-part <i>vCard</i> .  One business card - please, and all at once - FIG you!  And <i>iSync</i> does not know such a model.  Even, one might say, does not suspect about it.  The official sites neither Apple nor Nokia help, just link to each other, they say, you look for plug-ins for your phone wherever you want.  But, as always, Google helps - it leads me to the <a title="site" href="http://www.james-lloyd.com/scripts/nokia-series-40-isync-plugin/">site of</a> James Lloyd, the geek and IT evangelist, who wrote the plug-in for <i>Symbian series 40</i> that I needed (this OS is installed on many Nokia phone models, including 2630). <br>  <b>Further, the instruction from the site of James, in my free translation / retelling:</b> <br><ol><li>  Go to <i>Applications</i> , find <i>iSync</i> there, right click on it and select <i>"Show package content":</i> <i><br></i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/616/a9e/773/616a9e773288201595c2cbd035c76a09.png" width="281" height="85" alt="Picture 6"></li><li>  We pass the path: <i>Contents / PlugIns / ApplePhoneConduit.syncdevice / Contents / PlugIns Nokia-6131.phoneplugin:</i> <i><br></i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5b4/84a/a64/5b484aa64e487eb5655df7c7e6744255.png" alt="image"></li><li>  Again, right-click and select <i>"Show package content"</i> , go down even lower - <i>Contents / Resources:</i> <i><br></i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/db8/1e5/37c/db81e537cd7dd7ac61d4cf44d952b501.png" alt="image"></li><li>  Make a backup of the <i><b>MetaClasses.plist</b></i> file (but not in the same folder!) </li><li>  Copy the contents of the plugin from the site of James in this file </li></ol><br>  After rebooting, <i>iSync</i> immediately recognized its own and synchronized contacts ( <strong>Attention! Only via bluetooth!</strong> ). <br><br><h3>  3.3 GMail </h3><br>  Third, last rake ;-) <br>  Go to your box, <i>Contacts / Import</i> : <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a2a/637/1d5/a2a6371d55fddb31c319a295ebbaf06d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And we see that the guys from Google want to get a file with contacts in <i>CSV</i> format from us, and recommend using <i><a title="A to g" href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/26427/a-to-g">A to G</a></i> softphone to synchronize <i>Address Book</i> and <i>GMail</i> .  I don‚Äôt know what kind of poppies they have there in the <a title="Mountain view" href="http://wikimapia.org/3471/ru/%25D0%25A8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8-Google">Mountain View</a> , but <i>A to G</i> refused <i>to</i> work for me flatly.  But immediately there was an alternative in the form of <a href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/9312/address-book-exporter">Address Book Exporter</a> , which created the necessary <i>CSV</i> file that I fed <i>GMail</i> 'at.  The latter turned out to be a fine fellow: he compared all contacts and did not allow coincidences. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  He's point 4 - enjoy the result!  ;-) <br>  Everything is fine now, today I even found that <i>iCal</i> sucked all the birthdays from <i>Address Book</i> to itself. <br>  But there is no limit to perfection: I want to somehow find a way to extend the functionality of <i>iSync</i> or find a worthy replacement for it.  For example, it is not clear how to specify which contacts in which direction to merge.  If I accidentally deleted an e-mail from a contact on a mobile phone, then when synchronizing, <i>iSync</i> stubbornly wants to delete this e-mail from the contact on the poppy.  What is there to do? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/55612/">https://habr.com/ru/post/55612/</a></p>
