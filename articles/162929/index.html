From its contents it became clear that this is the undelivered message of the pigeon post of the Second World War. <br><br>  However, the content of the message was encrypted in case of interception, which is quite possible with this type of communication.  The words ‚ÄúDove Mail‚Äù and 27 handwritten blocks of code were printed on a piece of paper.  Thanks to media coverage, the attention of cryptography from all over the world was attracted to the riddle of the message, but it was not possible to solve the cipher.  Experts <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/160013/">were</a> skeptical about the possibility of hacking the code without cipher block or special literature.

      According <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20749632">to the</a> British Broadcasting Corporation, the code was still decoded, and Gord Young, a historian from Peterborough, did it.  With the help of aerial observations of his praddiad, who served in 92 squadron of the Royal Flight Corps, the code was decoded in a few minutes.  Young believes that the record was sent by a 27-year-old Sergeant William Stott, a shooter from Lancashire who landed in Normandy with pigeons to report on the situation of the German armed forces.  Sergeant Stott was killed a few weeks later, his body was buried in a Norman war grave. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  According to the historian, the code is based on acronyms, which makes it simple and reliable.  During the war, 250 thousand pigeons were used, and each of them received an individual number.  There are two identification numbers in this message: NURP.40.TW.194 and NURP.37.OK.76.  Stott used both birds to send the message, duplicating it for reliable transmission. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ab3/db9/a71/ab3db9a71437cf0b7e9b5940d4a276c0.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Young admitted that Stott was trained under the guidance of a former intelligence officer who had experience gained during the First World War: this is evident from the fact that the spelling of Serjeant, characteristic of the British armed forces of that particular time period, was used.  This style of writing immediately made the historian think in the direction of First World War acronyms.  Their use was dictated by the short (less than half an hour) operation time of autonomous radio transmitters that sent messages in Morse code. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f0a/b48/27d/f0ab4827dce0415a0e9aa29497ab66a0.jpg"><br><br>  The meaning of the fragments of the decrypted message makes Young's assumptions look convincing: <br><br>  AOAKN - Artillery Observer At "K" Sector, Normandy (Gunner artillery in the sector "K", Normandy) <br>  HVPKD - Have Panzers Know Directions (There are armored vehicles, I know the directions) <br>  Jerry's Whereabouts FNFJW - Final Note Found (Last entry [Confirmation] Found the location of the Fritz) <br>  DJHFP - Determined Jerry's Headquarters Front Posts (Defined front posts of the Fritz staff) <br>  CMPNW - Counter Measures Panzers Not Working (countermeasures [against] armored vehicles do not work) <br>  PABLIZ - Panzer Attack - Blitz (armor attack - blitz) <br>  KLDTS - Know Local Dispatch Station (I know [where] local unloading station) <br>  27/1526/6 - June 27, 1526 hours </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/162929/">https://habr.com/ru/post/162929/</a></p>
