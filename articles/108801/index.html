  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About some problems of development for the bada platform</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  May 17, 2010 launched the Samsung bada Developer Challenge, which included the Global Developer Challenge and the Local Developer Challenge.  Local competition was held in Russia as well. <br><img src="http://dpimg.ospos.net/contents/en_US/developer/apis/images/contest/evt1_7.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In general, about the SDK on the habr is already well written here <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/development/101196/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/development/101196</a> and here <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/mobiledev/105451/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/mobiledev/105451</a> . <br><br>  Add a small contribution from yourself ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It is difficult to write applications (and especially complex graphic applications) for bad.  Therefore, you should not wait for them under the platform in large quantities.  Although the platform is developing dynamically, and there is hope that, for example, in bada 2.0 the situation will improve. <br>  There is no normal GUI framework (the only normal way to do something graphically difficult is to draw on pixels yourself in OnDraw).  There is a visual GUI editor, but it exists rather for a tick, it is very limited and is only suitable for the Hello World level. <br>  Manual memory management, and if the simulator is still possible to track how much your program consumes memory in the process, then it does not work on real hardware (which is honestly warned in the documentation).  Somehow you can understand how little the application is flowing, you can only on the secondary signs, when, for example, the phone starts to swear that it lacks resources, and it‚Äôs time to close everything.  Thus, the main method is mindful of the code and the head.

      After we managed to cope with all these problems and get a product for the first appload after a week of waiting, we received a report on 5 bugs.  Three of them were attached video clips, one just screenshots.  Three of them were obvious, and were quickly corrected, but the other two ... <br><br>  First: the application will not determine the coordinates of the GPS, although the GPS is on and the satellites are caught.  As proof, there were screenshots from our application (without a signal), and screenshots of the native client, who safely showed these coordinates.  It is clear that the definition of coordinates is a fundamental function of our application, and it works (we have never seen such a bug in ourselves).  Under what conditions was found a bug - not a word, only some screenshots.  The question asked about the specific steps that lead to such behavior remained unanswered. <br><br>  Second, if during recording audio notes (we have the function of recording a note and attaching it to a point on the card), the alarm goes off, then it goes off without sound. <br><br>  Both of these bugs confused us.  The first is that the application receives the coordinates from the standard system service, and if something does not work, then most likely this is not our problem.  But how to prove it?  The second one - again, when the focus is lost, the application correctly closes the recorder and other resources, why the alarm clock starts without sound is completely incomprehensible. <br><br>  By the way, it turned out that the native recorder works in the same way.  There is a suspicion that the programmers who developed the operating system thought reasonably: if there is a recording on the microphone at the moment, then initiating the alarm will lead to ‚Äúblocking‚Äù of the audio stream!  And turned off the alarm for this time.  Perhaps this is correct. <br><br>  The fight against these bugs took us some time, but, nevertheless, we figured out that. <br>  And so, solving the problem after the problem, we made an application that was not only recognized as successful, but also won the main prize bada Developer Challenge in Russia!  Now, taking first place in the competition, we provide an opportunity for users to try and <a href="http://toozla.com/ru/download/bada/">evaluate our product</a> . <br><br>  Ps.  Until the global competition is over, the application is not available in the Samsung Store, but you can try similar applications on other platforms (so far without a card). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108801/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108801/</a></p>
