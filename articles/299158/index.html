  <section class="page js-page"><h1>People with low self-esteem catastrophically zadolbali</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><a name="habracut"></a>  People with low self-esteem (LNS) - is pipets. <br><br>  People with low self-esteem inadequately respond to criticism.  They all take it personally.  All people make mistakes.  When you make a mistake with an adequate person, he understands everything, the conversation is constructive.  A person with low self-esteem perceives the analysis of the situation as an insult, mental trauma, evidence of his inferiority.  <b>Low self-esteem prevents him from separating himself from the situation, himself from his mistake.</b> <br><br>  When you need sound criticism, do not expect to receive it from a person with low self-esteem.  Instead of parsing mistakes, you get a little knife stuck in the back with an unsure little hand of a miserable little man.  LNS will most likely try to use your slip against you.  Not even to take your place yourself, no.  <b>Dipping another into the same shit in which he has been cooking all his life is the most accessible way for him to assert himself.</b>

      People with low self-esteem is very difficult to teach.  When you tell them something new, they think that in this way they are shown their stupidity or other shortcomings.  Even if there are no such flaws, they will invent them for themselves.  Or invent, as if you are trying in this way to indicate their imperfection. <br><br>  People with low self-esteem are disgusting workers.  Work for them is a punishment.  Say, there was a real production need to remove shit from the porch.  It would never occur to a normal person that ‚Äúthey are trying to humiliate him‚Äù in this way.  In LNS, such an order will cause a protest.  He will be sure that he was sent to remove the shit, not because it needs to be done, because it stinks, but because "they want to show him that he alone deserves it."  Even a personal example will not put in place the brains of a particularly neglected LNS. <br><br>  Some LNS try to hide their low self-esteem behind the screen of "aggressive behavior."  They are prone to constant attempts at self-assertion.  But come on, they would assert themselves, achieving something.  They resort to the most heinous and cheap way - to humiliate the other.  At work, this translates into disruption of meetings and discussions, sabotaging errands, bases, mobbing. <br><br>  People with low self-esteem dare to flock.  I am afraid to imagine how many destinies were broken only because a flock of insignificant ghouls sabotaged the work of a new team member. <br><br>  Especially often this happens when, in a team of over-aged, non-achieving worthlessness, they appoint the head of a person who is significantly younger than them: <br><br>  - Let's teach this upstart (of course, suddenly he will achieve even more, and you will continue to hiss to the end of his life viciously hiss in the corners). <br>  - She is too self-assured, she has overstated PCI (not everyone can be trembling creatures). <br>  - Well, you have self-conceit (no, this is your low self-esteem). <br>  - Why was he appointed, I have been working here for five years (I didn‚Äôt have to wipe my pants and be afraid to insert a word). <br><br>  Low self-esteem underlies the phenomenon, which I called the "stinky loonie".  <i>By the way, I will soon post here a note about the losers, which I once prepared for one magazine, a little rewritten for Habr.</i> <br><br>  Infinite self-digging and dependence on other people's assessments makes LNS depressed, drives them into depression and depression.  Instead of changing themselves and striving for something, they constantly zamkayut sticky smelly lump of their complexes. <br><br>  To communicate with them is very difficult.  I have already said how they perceive criticism.  Praise and compliments they perceive even worse.  It seems to them that this is flattery, an attempt to use them. <br><br>  Very often there is a nauseous background around LNS.  This lns nauseatingly whines.  Everything is bad for him, everything is wrong for him, everyone is being insulted, life is crap, work is garbage.  It is annoying. <br><br>  People with low self-esteem should not be given any leverage.  In order to avoid a catastrophe. <br><br>  <b>I would send people with low self-esteem for compulsory treatment, forbid them to bring up children, engage in pedagogical work, and also unite in groups of more than two people.</b> <br><br>  <i>By the way, another dash LNSov: they are suspicious, everywhere they recognize themselves and are terribly offended.</i>  <i>Find yourself a hi, welcome to kamenty, proceed to a continuous contract, minus one ;-)</i> The rest enjoy life!  :-) <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_clever/56105/">Very correct comment about replicants</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299158/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299158/</a></p>
