The product can be simple, moderately complex or complex.  The quality of a complex product is difficult to prove because not everyone understands the details. <br></li><li>  Responsibility is your responsibility for product quality.  It is always important for a potential client that for his money you are in some way responsible for the quality of the product. <br></li><li>  Making a decision is the time that your client will think whether to buy your product or not, or whether to buy your product from you or not. <br></li><li>  Natural demand is essentially your number of attempts to sell.  And this is the coverage of the audience of the market (market size), the audience is with the formed demand, which can make a purchase today and the one that could buy the product in principle.  Well, you know, the name of the section here for the letter E :) <br></li><li>  Price is one of the most important factors in decision making.  By reducing the size of the price or its significance, you are guaranteed to increase customer loyalty. <br></li></ul><br></div></div><br><br>  Despite the eccentric name, when I laid out my business on this model, I understood why I could not grow and what was stopping me.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><br>  The logic of the model is quite simple, the closer to the center, the more complex the business and the more nuances, and the farther from the center, the simpler the product and the easier the conversion.  The ideal task is to spend your time only on a green circle, then the traffic from simple products will be almost automatically generated in orders for complex ones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/ef5/e03/77f/ef5e0377fa43a8c016e9ca03d42a9501.jpg"><br><br>  Occupying this or that niche in business, we always have a choice in which circles to work, but we need to take care that our offer is ‚ÄúRound‚Äù and does not extend beyond its own zone, then everything will be OK. <br><br>  True, I know three professions that actually contradict this hypothesis, but at the same time they successfully develop, but about them <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/ldmco/blog/299112/">in the end</a> . <br><br>  For example, my business at the time of launch for almost all services looked like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/6e8/233/661/6e823366174eeff3ec3723fbb3a63cb8.jpg"><br><br>  And I was surprised that everything somehow does not work very well.  It turned out as in the army, square kata, and we wear a round one. <br><br>  For example, the Yandex.Direct advertising campaign development service on the red circle looks like a real booty: <br><ul><li>  Product - to explain what the difference is not always possible, because  not everyone understands you, and who understands, often he can already make himself Direct. <br></li><li>  <b>About</b> responsibility - customers want orders from the site, and most companies working only with advertising, in a good way, can not guarantee a 100% successful result for the client's money. <br></li><li>  Making a decision is complicated by the fact that the majority of customers do not see the difference between the offers on the market and pay attention to those who ‚Äúnod more often‚Äù or the price is sweeter. <br></li><li>  Natural demand is because  the red circle is the market of the formed demand, there is a real slaughter for the direct lead in Yandex Direct.  Moreover, the cost of attracting a client seeks to exceed the income from the creation of an advertising company. <br></li><li>  Tsena - because  the main client does not see the difference in the proposals, it is difficult for him to explain the difference in the commercial proposals, due to the lack of information in terms.  You just will not listen and go much sweeter or where "nod more often." <br></li></ul><br><br>  It is possible to work in this circle, and many TOP companies do this successfully, they put a check that pays back costs and targets large customers. <br>  And most companies tend to be staffed by a ‚Äúfat‚Äù, understanding professional client. <br>  In general, this is a market for serious players with thick wallets. <br><br><h1>  We have chosen the path for the rogue :) </h1><br><br>  I decided to hit the green circle market, first of all, having created the <u><a href="http://ksenmart.ru/">software for creating online stores</a></u> , which was created earlier, is completely free.  This automatically gave rise to the base of contacts of the target audience and the opportunity to communicate with them. <br><br>  Expanding free online stores you do not undertake the obligations of a successful start of a client's business, however, we tried our best to insure the user with tips and tutorials.  Other factors P.O.P.E.TS.  also becoming irrelevant. <br><br>  As a nice bonus, I was printed for free on the cover of a <u>local magazine</u> . <br><br><h2>  But with the service of creating and maintaining campaigns in Yandex Direct, it was not so simple ... </h2><br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow to put it on an external orbit came only now, but more on that later.  It turned out that I needed to shrink to the inner circle or make an offer that would lead me at least to the middle circle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/527/9a1/cf3/5279a1cf342aa33f68e9cabfc68bf44e.jpg"><br><br><h3>  A proposal was made for Central Asia: </h3><br>  - High-quality advertising campaign in Yandex Direct for 14 days, for 30,000 rubles, if something does not like it, for any reason, we will return 100% of the money. <br><br>  I even entered it into a legal contract.  He was guided by a simple trailer, if the client likes everything, then he himself will not refuse us, and if we do it, then this is what we need.  Additional iron to the right place is always well motivated by our staff. <br><br><h4>  Pros: </h4><br><ol><li>  clients no longer needed to explain what, why, and how we do, we shared risks with them, and this was appealing; <br></li><li>  sales of services went much easier than before, production was loaded even without advertising; <br></li><li>  none of the clients, at the time of this writing, demanded a refund, because  understood the amount of work done for him. <br></li></ol><br><br><h4>  Minuses: </h4><br><ol><li>  advertisers in narrow niches with small campaigns and good budgets fell off the minimum 30,000 rubles; <br></li><li>  because of the iron, production began to be reworked in three, making huge campaigns for analytics, it took time to start and a budget for testing; <br></li><li>  investment in creation has increased many times, and the risk of failing because of the KP‚Äôs fault on the site was all the same; <br></li><li>  I had to enter the minimum bar of the money spent in Yandex before the completion of the contract of 100,000 rubles. In order to roll back the analytics, in some niches it blurred the first start for several months. <br></li></ol><br><br>  I had to redo everything ... <br><br><h3>  Now our offer looks like this: </h3><br><br>  - Free create a high-quality advertising campaign in Yandex Direct for 3 working days + free maintenance for 7 days <br><br>  And now, for this service, we are already on the green circle.  Now, we have the opportunity to choose a client.  It only remains for me to think of something with the creation of landing pages and marketing analysis. <br><br><h3>  Naturally, we are not completely sbrenili </h3><br>  We bestowed a free service with a number of restrictions and made a <u>virus chip</u> , but at the same time left a full range of service to show a test drive of the <u>full service of our company</u> . <br><br>  I do not know how anyone, but I used to have a signed contract for direct before about 10,000, after 24 after the <a href="https://vk.com/ldm_co%3Fw%3Dwall46603805_647%252Fall">first service launch tests</a> I received 12 leads for 0 rubles.  Draw conclusions ... <br>  We have removed all the worked out mechanisms that ate a lot of time into the accompanying offers, since  100% all are not always needed.  Thus, they received a demanded service in the market. <br><br>  So, I advise everyone to reconsider your business proposal for customers, and to redo it through the PPO, good luck! <br>  There will be questions, <a href="http://ldmco.ru/potok-klientov/yandeks-direkt/">please contact</a> .  I have been living this philosophy for a long time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299112/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299112/</a></p>
