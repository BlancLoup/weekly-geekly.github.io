" <br><br>  In his article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/64845/">Ideas, money and greedy children,</a> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/devich/" class="user_link">Devich</a> cites as an example the fictional Anton, Nicholas and Michael, and tells beautifully how cautious Kohl was left sitting on his idea and without money, and risky Anton selling the car and laying the apartment eventually went to the house. <br><br>  In the same way, you can think of a dozen more stories about these three men, one of whom <a name="habracut"></a>  Kohl revealed his plans to Misha, and Misha threw Kohl, hiring Anton and implementing Colin's idea.  And in another story, Anton lost his apartment, because Misha took over the whole business, and suggested that Anton sit on his salary, and then he fired him altogether.  In the third story, Misha refused both Kohl and Anton, Kohl went to work for his uncle and think about his idea further, but Anton did not receive investments and gradually consumed the entire loan for his apartment, his business died, the bank chose the apartment, and he fell into depression, drunk and now homeless in the South-West. <br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/devich/" class="user_link">Devich</a> asks what these stories teach us?  And nothing, since they are sucked from the finger, and the article is unfounded a little more than completely.

      No less amusing are the comments of <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/devich/" class="user_link">Devich's</a> opponents, who claim that ideas are worth the money. <br>  In their position, to sell the idea, and not its implementation, they are close to the so-called "copywriting", so "loved" on Habr√©.  In this sense, ‚ÄúCopirasty‚Äù is even more honest - they even implemented their ‚Äúidea‚Äù (recorded music, made a film, released software, developed technology, invested money in promotion), and then received (want to receive) money without doing anything. <br>  While <strike>our spaceships are plying the Bolshoi Theater, the</strike> progressive world struggles with the copywriters for the freedom of information, these irresponsible habituaries try [to inspire us to think] to sell ideas. <br><br>  If your idea is really worth the money, and you do not trust sly investors, then sell the car, lay down an apartment (like Anton :), borrow money from parents and friends and realize your Idea!  After all, it is worth the money, and will definitely pay off.  :) <br>  You do not want?  Are you afraid?  There are no ideas, but the hunt is just to cheer?  Well, it means that your comments are unfounded a little more than full. <br><br>  Everything in life is much more diverse and interesting, and there are no ready answers.  It is possible that there are ideas that are so ingenious and new, but easy to implement, that they need to be kept secret and developed at their own expense by putting the latest coats on them, as any good manager with a lot of money who knows the topic will be able to implement your idea faster and better than you - such ideas are worth millions.  Perhaps there are ideas that have come to almost everyone‚Äôs heads, but no one has yet thought of bringing it to life in quality - such ideas cost nothing, but your project that implements the idea is an order of magnitude better than its competitors - it costs money. <br><br>  So in fact ... in fact, all this post of mine is unsubstantiated a little more than completely. <br><br>  I did it for the lulz :) <br><br>  I propose to close this holivornoy theme and enjoy the rest of Sunday, preparing for a productive work week! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/64870/">https://habr.com/ru/post/64870/</a></p>
