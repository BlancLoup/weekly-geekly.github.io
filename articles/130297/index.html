      For a start, a very small background story: <br><br>  I‚Äôve been picking a perfect 3G modem for my laptop for a long time, and eventually I found what I‚Äôm looking for - the PCMCIA <a href="http://attsupport.option.com/att/gt-ultra">Option Globetrotter Ultra</a> modem.  The modem was found on Ebay and cost along with delivery to Kiev at $ 20.  Here it must be said that the seller honestly warned that the modem is locked, but I nevertheless bought it, having made sure beforehand that a (paid) program exists for unlocking.  When the modem arrived, I decided first of all to check for blocking.  Unfortunately, the lock was in place, which the modem control program reported to me immediately after installing the drivers, and offered to contact AT &amp; T for clarification. <br><br>  And then I thought - why not turn? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  To begin with, I tried to use the online chat on the AT &amp; T website, since I have better written oral English.  But in order to use the chat, registration is required on the AT &amp; T website, and only their customers can register there by account number, or phone number and address, so this option was dropped. <br><br>  However, in the process of wandering through the AT &amp; T <a href="http://www.att.com/esupport/article.jsp%3Fsid%3D55002%26cv%3D820">website, a help page</a> was found that suggested calling at 1-800-331-0500 to determine if the device could be unlocked.  I called Skype on this number (the call is free). <br><br>  Communication with the IVR robot turned out to be the most difficult - it was not possible to ‚Äúget through‚Äù it on the first attempt, since the system tried hard to identify me at least somehow - at least by zip code (ZIP-code).  Finding a valid ZIP-code on the Internet was not a problem, and the IVR-lady deigned to switch me to a living person. <br><br>  A live person to my question about the possibility of unlocking a wireless modem answered that I got into the wired telephony department, but he can dictate to me the phone number of the cellular department.  Writing down the number and hanging up, I found that the number he dictated to me was the same one that I dialed initially - just for some reason their IVR switched them so. <br><br>  I called back again, having already routinely passed the ‚Äúrobot‚Äù, and ... again I got into the wired telephony department.  But this time, when the employee heard my question, he offered to switch me to the cellular communication department, to which I agreed, and after a few minutes of listening to the advertisement, I heard the long-awaited ‚ÄúAT &amp; T.  How may i help you, Sir? ‚ÄùAlready from a member of the cellular department. <br><br>  The whole conversation with this employee took about a minute: I said that I had bought a modem on Ebay, and I would like to use it on another operator‚Äôs network, for which I need an unlock code.  The support officer asked me to call IMEI or the modem‚Äôs serial number.  I called IMEI, and after a few seconds a question followed whether I was ready to write down the 8-digit unlock code. <br><br>  Everything! <br><br>  The method of entering the unlock code in the modem was found earlier, and consisted in sending a special AT command - AT + CLCK = ‚ÄúPN‚Äù, 0, ‚Äúreceived_code‚Äù to the modem when the SIM card was removed.  The modem answered OK to the command, and now it works wonderfully with any SIM cards. <br><br>  Here is a story. <br><br>  ps Unfortunately, to unlock the iphone, this method will not work, as described in a <a href="http://www.att.com/esupport/article.jsp%3Fsid%3DKB82027">separate article in the AT &amp; T knowledge base</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130297/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130297/</a></p>
