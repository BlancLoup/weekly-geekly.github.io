      <b>Why did TorrentFreak become so popular?</b>  <b>What is your zest?</b> <br><br>  <i>Enigmax</i> : Now there are a lot of sites about file sharing, but no one writes daily.  Nobody creates as much copyright content as we do.  Nobody studies events in all details, like us.  Visit us any day - and you will definitely see something new, even on Christmas Eve.  In addition, we always respond personally to all who write to us. <br><br>  <b>How has the Internet world changed while TorrentFreak exists?</b> <br><br>  <i>Ernesto</i> : the most significant change is the growth of video hosting sites and sites that use video.  When we launched our site, Youtube was just a few months old.  Over the subsequent time, video sites have become incredibly popular. <br><br>  <b>You are tracking the topic of copyright oppositions and are up to date on all the latest events</b>  <b>What are the main trends on this front?</b> <br><br>  <i>Ernesto</i> : right holders are no longer suing individual users, but pushing bills that put all the responsibility for ‚Äúillegal‚Äù traffic on providers. <br><br>  <b>Copyright critics are very different, from the moderate Lawrence Lassig to the radical The Pirate Bay.</b>  <b>Where would you put yourself on such a scale?</b> <br><br>  <i>Enigmax</i> : difficult question.  TorrentFreak does not have an official position, we believe in freedom of choice.  Ernesto never tells me what to think, and vice versa.  My opinion on various issues is changing: I am rarely as moderate as Lessig, and as rarely radical as the guys from The Pirate Bay.  It all depends on the case. <br><br>  <b>How do you remain optimistic in the face of constant tightening of copyright laws?</b> <br><br>  <i>Ernesto</i> : I sincerely believe that piracy cannot be destroyed by law.  The way out is not in new laws, but in innovations.  Pirates show what people really want. <br><br>  <b>And a few standard questions that I ask to collect different opinions:</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>Sony Pictures CEO Michael Linton said that "the Internet has not given us anything good."</b>  <b>Does network development really lead to the collapse of the audio-video industry?</b> <br><br>  <i>Enigmax</i> : The audio-video industry feels great, much better than the time when there was no Internet.  The global network has given this industry many new ways to make money. <br><br>  <b>What good internet gave you?</b> <br><br>  <i>Enigmax</i> : the ability to communicate in real time, as well as instantly receive and transmit information.  Technically speaking, this is the most important essence of my life. <br><br>  <b>Are there any disadvantages in the promotion of digital technology?</b>  <b>Do not be afraid of the abundance of low-quality products on the network?</b> <br><br>  <i>Enigmax</i> : No <br><br>  <b>According to Mark Getty, the owner of Getty Images, ‚Äúintellectual property is the oil of the 21st century‚Äù.</b>  <b>Do you think he's right?</b> <br><br>  <i>Enigmax</i> : Well, that was for the first few years.  In the coming years, we are likely to see big changes when most of the copyright authorities transfer from multi-billion companies into the hands of ordinary people. <br><br>  <b>Information is not material, therefore has no price.</b>  <b>But people creating it need to pay for work.</b>  <b>Can you solve this dilemma?</b> <br><br>  <i>Enigmax</i> : The media industry is trying to solve this dilemma by writing information to disk and selling it.  But we all see what they get from this. <br><br>  <b>And what will happen next?</b>  <b>Is there a trade-off between media corporations and regular users?</b> <br><br>  <i>Enigmax</i> : the solution is not to tighten copyright laws, because people ignore the unfair, in their opinion, rules.  And generally do not recognize those that are practically impracticable. <br><br>  Similarly, the solution cannot be found in the midst of piracy.  A compromise between media companies and pirates is absolutely impossible. <br><br>  If, however, media companies could rethink their approach and look at the pirates as customers, it would help everyone.  It is always possible to find agreement between companies and customers, but for this, media companies need to forget about yesterday's profits - this time is gone forever.  Unfortunately, while they can not accept this, so the war continues.  And this means that we will have something to write about for years to come. <br><br>  ‚Äì‚Äì <br><br>  I repeat once again: friends, if you enjoyed the interview and you speak English - write a few good words to the guys, let them be pleased.  Paraphrasing a well-known remark, the heroes should know their audience :) Here are their contacts: <br><br>  <b>tips [dog] torrentfreak (dot) com</b> <b><br></b>  <b>ernesto [dog] torrentfreak (dot) com</b> <b><br></b>  <b>enigmax [dog] torrentfreak (dot) com</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77548/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77548/</a></p>
