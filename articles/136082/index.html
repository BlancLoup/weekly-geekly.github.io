But always could not find a suitable model.  That weight is great, the screen is small, the processor is weak.  But a miracle happened and I found out about a new branch of laptops - ultrabooks.  And perhaps the best known to represent this family, after the brainchild of Apple, is the Asus Zenbook. <br>  Who is interested in the review of this wonderful device, please roll up.  <i>Attention: many photos.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Overview </h4><br>  I chose this device from the criteria of performance, weight and price.  Now on the market a lot of ultrabooks.  But I chose this one because of the screen resolution, very much 1366x768 is not enough for me, but Asus has 1600x900, which is certainly nice. <br>  <i>Here are the specifications:</i> <br><ul><li>  Model: Intel Core i5 / Core i7 </li><li>  RAM: 4096 (DDR3-1333) </li><li>  Data storage: SSD 128/256 GB </li><li>  Video: Intel HD Graphics 3000 </li><li>  Diagonal (inches): 13.3 </li><li>  Resolution: 1600x900 </li><li>  Network: Wi-Fi (b / g / n), Bluetooth </li><li>  Webcam: 0.3 MP </li><li>  Ports HDMI, VGA, USB 2.0, USB 3.0, headphone and microphone jack, SD card reader </li><li>  Battar: Li-Ion </li><li>  Width (cm): 32.5 </li><li>  Depth (cm): 22.3 </li><li>  Height (cm): 0.3-1.7 </li><li>  Weight (kg): 1.3 </li></ul><br>  As we can see from the characteristics, this is a very thin and light device with good characteristics. <br>  What really? <br>  Let's start from the beginning. <br>  The ultrabook box was made very nicely and strictly, it was immediately obvious that there would be something unusual in front of you. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/620/7c0/3b2/6207c03b217ea9796af06cd47a972cc6.jpg"><br>  All that was in the box is the ultrabook itself, a charger, a power adapter, a cable tie, documents, a mini VGA-VGA adapter, an Enternet adapter, an ultrabook case and an adapter case. <br>  Here are all without charging and documents: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/61e/607/747/61e607747315b70b5c8a689a2d225136.jpg"><br>  The charger is compact, which is undoubtedly good when traveling: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d42/4a7/c17/d424a7c17da7878cca50e1ba858c7f44.jpg"><br>  Particularly pleased that the bundled case comes.  It is made of fabric and leather.  The ultrabook lies in it perfectly and is very convenient to carry in the bag: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6e0/59c/8fe/6e059c8fea3155cfe319225662b5c4f0.jpg"><br>  I also wrote that the cover for adapters is attached, I personally use it for flash drives and adapters for the mouse, it‚Äôs convenient that I won‚Äôt lose and yet some uniform style is obtained. <br><br>  The ultrabook lid opens very easily, with one hand and do not need to hold the lower part.  Here is our hero in the clear: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ab3/572/710/ab35727103e51ac89ab1da42bcfade11.jpg"><br>  Zenbuk keyboard is very nice.  The keys are large.  many wrote that it is hard to press - I can refute, everything is done easily.  Maybe it depends on the ultrabook itself.  Also unusual is the location of the power button.  It is located in the upper right corner, which should have caused inconvenience.  But I admit that I have never clicked on it accidentally, although it is adjacent to the delete key. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/245/5a7/f02/2455a7f021cae8c59f1ee613beb503e5.jpg"><br>  The device itself is made very high quality, solid metal, nothing backlash, very quiet. <br>  And most importantly, a very thin body. <br>  Here are photos for comparison with the Parker pen.  By the way, there are rubber legs on the bottom, which is why the device on the table is slightly elevated. <br>  Right side: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c6f/0ca/bd2/c6f0cabd2231a10825c5f5aefd35aab3.jpg"><br>  Left side: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4aa/c10/75d/4aac1075d81889f39d9966a6ae014ef7.jpg"><br>  Front part: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e4e/3a5/782/e4e3a5782b563c2cbcb604c43dcb1fa8.jpg"><br>  Rear part: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5f7/348/c20/5f7348c2092f7fa13f05e1189c1fdf3c.jpg"><br>  View from above: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fac/4a3/62f/fac4a362f16a36aededf4706ada97cb1.jpg"><br>  Bottom view: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/abb/866/262/abb866262ee0f7b59572706eb158cde5.jpg"><br>  The entire body, with the exception of the keyboard, is made of metal. <br>  As you can see on the sides, we have two USB, one of which is 3.0, card reader, mini HDMI, mini VGA, headphone / microphone port, charging port. <br>  Also there is an indicator of the hard disk. <br>  There is nothing behind us, but radiator grilles are visible from below.  By the way, the ultrabook is heated only under some loads, such as games.  Video, office and internet are cold as steel.

      Ultrabook speakers made by Bang &amp; Olufsen, which should have been a good sound.  Yes, he is good, but the bass is rather weak.  Although for these sizes - an excellent result. <br><br>  Ultrabook touchpad is large, responsive, supports multitouch. <br><br>  I‚Äôll write a little bit about the ultrabook stuffing, I‚Äôll just say that there is a solid-state drive, 4 GB of RAM and an Intel Core i5 installed (there are also models with i7).  Everything works without "lags", even toys such as Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 are dragging on, but certainly not at maximum settings. <br><br>  The ultrabook battery is not removable, but at the power saving mode it keeps stable for 6 hours. <br><br>  Perhaps all that I could tell. <br>  I will answer any questions about the device. <br><br>  And lastly: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/84a/9cc/b60/84a9ccb60f2dba13f6c7e06f3e6e2c60.jpg"><br><br>  PS I apologize for the quality of the photos. <br>  PPS Many ask about the price.  Bought in St. Petersburg, the RIC store, for 39990 rubles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136082/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136082/</a></p>
