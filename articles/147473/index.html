  <section class="page js-page"><h1>20 best iOS and Android applications 2012</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As of mid-2012, 1.2 million mobile applications are available for download on iOS and Android devices.  With such a huge choice, available literally in one tapa - including dozens of decent applications submitted to our court every day - the task of compiling a six-month list of the "best of the best" new applications is more difficult (and more enjoyable) than ever before. <br><br>  Of the hundreds (if not thousands) of iOS and Android apps released in 2012, apps worthy of being in the top 20 list can do everything from estimating the value of a house from a photo of it, to earning loyalty points to users just for viewing them favorite TV programs.  We also welcomed the sequel to the long-awaited game, which, one way or another, exceeded all our expectations. <br><br>  Let's quickly run through our methodology before starting.  All selected applications were either released for the first time or significantly updated from January 1 to June 30 of this year.  Applications that debuted on iOS and Android, which were previously available on other platforms, could also be included in the sample.  All of our applicants were found, selected and put to places by Appolicious Advisors and members of our community.  In all, about a dozen Appolicious editors offered their favorites to review.  We also surveyed the most active and influential users of sites and applications from Appolicious.  We did not take into account the number of downloads of applications or their overall popularity.  Our qualitative assessment is based mainly on the usefulness and creative component of each of the applications in our list.

      Let's get started. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/837/471/450/83747145010320acd7563265b27f9586.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Top iOS Apps </h2><br><br>  <b><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/camera-awesome/id420744028">Camera Awesome</a> (iPhone, iPod Touch: free)</b> <br><br>  Although the <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/facebook-acquires-instagram.html">sale of Instagram to the social networking site Facebook</a> was on the front pages of all news outlets earlier this year, the best new app for 2012 was another photo-sharing service that also helps you take more beautiful pictures.  Created by SmugMug, a site with a decade of experience in the field of photo-sharing, Camera Awesome is a revelation in Iphone photography and another reason many of us can throw away our digital cameras.  In addition to the stunning interface, Camera Awesome has several ways to dramatically improve your photos, including automatic leveling and color settings.  All possible predefined settings and filters can be purchased inside the application for $ 9.99 (or separately, for choice, for 99 cents a piece).  The ability to capture video up to 5 seconds before you press the record button is also an excellent option.  Finally, using Camera Awesome is very easy to share photos through your favorite social networks (including Instagram). <br><br>  <b><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/pocket-formerly-read-it-later/id309601447">Pocket</a> (Formerly Read It Later) (Universal: Free, also available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.ideashower.readitlater.pro">Android</a> )</b> <br><br>  Independent apps to ‚Äúread later‚Äù can go to the category of endangered species this fall after Apple turns on its Offline Reading List in Safari as part of iOS 6. Until then (and possibly after) the best app for leaving bookmarks in the stream of the information you are viewing (and, almost free), Pocket will remain.  Previously known as Read It Later, the application experienced a rebranding in April, which was not only about changing the name and lowering prices.  The new features of Pocket, which include the ability to easily view videos and images, as well as lists of articles compiled on the basis of the grid, do not overlap with a simple and elegant application interface. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/khan-academy/id469863705">Khan Academy</a> (iPad: free)</b> <br><br>  The best thing about this application is that it does not interfere with or distract from expert video lessons created by a new generation educator, Salman Khan.  More than 3,200 educational videos that cover everything from ‚ÄúGetting Initial Funding by a Venture Company‚Äù to ‚ÄúEducating the Earth‚Äù or ‚ÄúLanding in the Bay of Pigs‚Äù are divided into categories using a simple system.  YouTube videos with subtitles are generously logged, allowing users to quickly and easily find a phrase or passage they may have missed. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/touchtv/id494181695">TouchTV</a> (iPad: free)</b> <br><br>  The supplier of customizable news content SkyGrid is the TouchTV application, which perfectly shows videos from the broadcast and cable networks on the iPad.  TouchTV plays video clips (usually up to 5 minutes) from 16 official providers, including ESPN, Bloomberg Television and Jimmy Kimmel Live.  Although TouchTV downloads alone are not enough to ‚Äúcut the wire‚Äù from your satellite or cable TV provider, the app only provides a quick overview of what the cable television universe can provide to its users.  TouchTV has joined video search services like Showyou and Squrl (each of which has experienced a major update this year) among the top iOS apps for watching videos on Apple TV at the moment. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/any.do/id497328576">Any.Do</a> (iPhone, iPod Touch: free)</b> <br><br>  Our favorite Android app in June 2011 finally got out on an iOS device.  And it was worth the wait.  Any.Do, which is supported by Google Chairman Eric Schmidt, is a super-productive application that allows you to create and execute tasks with the touch of a finger.  The ability to record voice orders built into the application allows you to create tasks without having to type text manually.  Also, you can share your to-do list with friends in the hope that they will help you manage your tasks. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/highlight/id441534409">Highlight</a> (iPhone, iPod Touch: free)</b> <br><br>  This social local mobile application was first presented at the South By Southwest conference in mid-2012.  Highlight warns you when your friend or Facebook user with your similar interests is somewhere nearby, and lets you know more about other Highlight users when they are in your area.  Like similar services, including <a href="http://apps4all.ru/articles/apple/sonar.html">Sonar</a> , Banjo and Kismet, Highlight is only effective if a critical mass of other users is in your area.  Although each of these services has its strengths, Highlight seems to have the highest odds out of the entire mass of such applications. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/viggle/id487066871">Viggle</a> (iPhone, iPod touch: free, also available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.functionx.viggle">Android</a> )</b> <br><br>  Getting discounts from Amazon, Starbucks, and Gap just because you watch TV is like a dream come true.  Viggle brings it to life, giving users the opportunity to register and earn loyalty points for watching their favorite TV shows.  The application works reliably, and also offers users additional features and entertainment in the form of simple questions, polls and tweets. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/linkedin/id288429040">Updated LinkedIn</a> (Universal: Free)</b> <br><br>  The best thing about the April update of LinkedIn on iOS is that the application is finally compatible and optimized for the iPad.  Supposedly inspired by Flipboard (where it is most used), LinkedIn works best as a social magazine on the iPad.  LinkedIn on iPad‚Äôs magic is how it integrates information divided across your various contacts and displays your relationship with the sender in a way that no other application or site represents. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/clear/id493136154">Clear</a> (iPhone, iPod Touch: $ 2.99)</b> <br><br>  Clear is a task list for those who want to move and grow.  Although it lacks many of the functions that other, long-known task managers, such as Omnifocus, or newbies, such as Any.Do, Clear, are different in, it allows users to quickly create categories and a list of things they need to do and which fall under these categories.  The beautifully designed interface of the application also allows users to sort tasks by priority and quickly delete them when they are completed. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/homesnap/id506563991">HomeSnap</a> (iPhone, iPod Touch: free)</b> <br><br>  Although HomeSnap cannot do much to bring the American real estate market back to its pre-crisis level, this application - with the help of augmented reality technology - can help users determine the value of a house just by taking a photo of it.  In addition to the price of the house, you will be able to see information about nearby schools, data on the history of the house and the number of bathrooms and bedrooms available in this house.  The application is not 100% reliable, but in any case, this information is provided by the seller or broker. <br><br><h2>  The best games on iOS and Android </h2><br><br>  It is not by chance that most of the most popular games released in 2012 are on both platforms.  While on the Android platform when creating games there are some limitations associated with <hh user="http://apps4all.ru/articles/google/razrabotka-dlya-android.html">  With many different forms of devices and operating system versions, developers understand that they need to work on this platform in order not to lose a huge part of their audience. <br><br>  <b>OMGPOP <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/draw-something-by-omgpop/id488627858">Draw Something</a> (Universal: $ 2.99, also available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.omgpop.dstpaid">Android</a> )</b> <br><br>  Although the distribution of this unofficial version of Pictionary has slowed down after its acquisition by Zynga in March, there are several reasons why Draw Something recorded tens of millions of downloads only in the first weeks after the application was released (more than Angry Birds, Instagram and any other application in history).  It is really interesting!  The rules of the game are quite simple even for a five year old child.  In addition, the ability to socially integrate Draw Something via Facebook or email also greatly simplifies the process of playing with friends, no matter what iOS or Android device they have.  No device on any of these platforms?  Don't worry, Draw Something is coming soon. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/jazz-trumps-journey/id478314434">JAZZ: Trump's journey</a> (Universal: $ 2.99, also available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.bulkypix.jazz">Android</a> )</b> <br><br>  Based on Louis Armstrong's biography, JAZZ: Trump's journey is one of the best platform games.  With beautiful graphics that convey the atmosphere of New Orleans of the 1920s, convenient controls and, of course, a killer soundtrack, Trump's journey has enough capacity and depth to attract experienced players, and with its vivacity and sincerity it can attract newcomers. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/angry-birds-space/id499511971">Angry Birds Space</a> (iPhone and iPod Touch: $ 0.99, iPad: $ 2.99, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.rovio.angrybirdsspace.premium">Android</a> smartphones: $ 0.99, Android tablets: $ 2.99)</b> <br><br>  With the beginning of the advertising company, which literally broke all records, there was a fear that Angry Birds Space would not reach the advertised level, or it would become a simple variation on the theme of the previous game.  These fears flew into the stratosphere as soon as we could play it.  With a new gravitational mechanism, amazing new birds, a darker sky and a strange curious space aesthetics, Angry Birds Space is perhaps the most successfully updated and pleasant application in the whole twenty. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/n.o.v.a.-3-near-orbit-vanguard/id474764934">NOVA 3</a> (Universal: $ 6.99, also available for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftN3HM">Android</a> )</b> <br><br>  If you are a fan of first person shooters, then this game is for you.  Developed by Gameloft, the game NOVA 3 of all similar products available on mobile devices, most of all resembles a console game.  In NOVA 3, you will have to fight with aliens and other enemies on several planets (including the Earth destroyed by the war).  In multiplayer mode, you can team up with 11 players.  It takes about 30 minutes to complete each beautifully animated level.  This is a great way to spend seven dollars. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/spellsword/id498685137">Spellsword</a> (Universal: $ 0.99)</b> <br><br>  With a fierce and addictive gameplay, unique mechanics, retro graphics and music, the Spellsword game is a new platformer in the world of sword and witchcraft.  Use the sword to defeat enemies, simultaneously launching fireballs.  As you progress through the missions and maps, you will receive new spells and new enemies.  The best thing about the Spellsword is that it lacks the ability to make internal purchases, which means the player must earn all his achievements by himself. <br><br><h2>  Top Android Apps </h2><br><br>  Many of the best releases on Android were originally created for iOS devices.  But we all win when the best applications are available on different devices. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dflipboard.app">Flipboard</a> (free)</b> <br><br>  The best application of 2011 for the iPhone according to the version of Techcrunch in June finally officially came out on Android.  The social journal, which offers news, photos and status updates transmitted by your social graph, already included YouTube integration at the time of release.  Flipboard is the best way to read content from third-party publishers on mobile devices.  On June 28, the New York Times newspaper presented the NYT Everywhere service, through which subscribers can read the newspaper in the app. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.instagram.android">Instagram</a> (free)</b> <br><br>  The appearance of Instagram on Android has had a very positive effect on the success of the application.  Instagram was downloaded over 5 million times during the week.  A few days later the company acquired Facebook.  Such a triumph makes it clear that in order to become a real pop-cultural sensation, the application must be available on both iOS and Android. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.google.android.apps.docs">Google Drive</a> (free by subscription, also available on <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/google-drive/id507874739">iOS</a> )</b> <br><br>  Google Drive is a better and more economical document storage and sharing solution than Dropbox.  For those who already use Google Docs, switching to Google Drive is an obvious step.  The app works seamlessly on all Android devices.  On June 28, the application became available for iOS, and now nothing prevents it from starting its dominance in the market. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.airbnb.android">Airbnb</a> (free)</b> <br><br>  The Airbnbs app that appeared on the Android platform in January, which was previously available online and on iOS devices, has become something more than just copying and transferring to another platform.  The service intended for rental housing abroad, for the first time, allowed property owners and travelers to exchange instant messages to resolve any issues that might arise.  In the app there are over 200,000 housing options from around the world, as well as personal recommendations to travelers from people like Ashton Kutcher and Jack Dorsey. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.android.chrome">Chrome</a> (free, only on devices with Ice Cream Sandwich, also available on <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/chrome/id535886823">iOS</a> )</b> <br><br>  If you use the Chrome browser on your PC and you have a smartphone or tablet on the Ice Cream Sandwich platform, there is nothing to think about purchasing this application.  Chrome mobile and PC apps seamlessly interact with each other, which means you can access your bookmarks and browsing history from within the app.  The application also allows you to navigate between tabs without having to enter the menu.  The Chrome app supports voice search, bookmarked pages and anonymous access.  Like Google Drive, Chrome was released on iOS devices on June 28, during the Google I / O 2012 conference. <br><br>  <i>Note: The author, Brad Spirrison, is the chief editor of the <a href="http://www.appolicious.com/">Appolicious</a> Mobile Search <a href="http://www.appolicious.com/">Service</a> , <a href="http://www.androidapps.com/">AndroidApps.com</a> (with the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.appolicious.android">Appolicious Android App</a> ) and <a href="http://www.appvee.com/">AppVee</a> .</i>  <i>And this is his fifth semi-annual review of the best applications, made specifically for TechCrunch.</i> </hh></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147473/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147473/</a></p>
