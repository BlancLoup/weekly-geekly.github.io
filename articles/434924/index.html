This is an email-sending event for IT-specialists, founders of start-ups and marketers. <br><br>  My task is to filter out prohibitively expensive and advertising events - free or very accessible conferences, lectures and seminars fall into the newsletter, the purpose of which is to tell something interesting, help to improve skills or introduce like-minded people. <br><br>  Interestingly, in recent years, most of these events are held in coworkings.  What is surprising, according to my observations, the number of similar sites in Moscow is growing.

The authors explore modern offices and highlight the main directions in approaches to the design of workplaces in the XXI century. <br><br>  For example, the book tells about the <a href="http://www.zaha-hadid.com/architecture/bmw-central-building/">project</a> <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4,_%25D0%2597%25D0%25B0%25D1%2585%25D0%25B0">Zaha Hadid</a> (Zaha Hadid) for the company BMW.

Here are the interiors and floor plans of offices from different countries.  The book by van Uffelin is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Offices-Architecture-Focus-Chris-Uffelen/product-reviews/3037681462">praised</a> for the fact that it includes not only works from the most famous architects and studios, but also less famous projects. <br><br>  One of the buildings described in the ‚ÄúOffices‚Äù is the Munich Technology Center (MTZ).  It was built as a space for startups in which they can rent an office and meet other young technology companies. <br><br>  The peculiarity of the MTZ is the green <a href="https://zinco-greenroof.com/references/munich-technology-centre-munich">roof</a> .  It has solar panels installed next to which a ‚Äúcarpet‚Äù of plants is planted.  Landscaping on the roof not only decorates the building, but also protects it from heat and city noise, and also collects rainwater. <br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o8/os/p-/o8osp-zo1bwcb1yzb5sthjo79ya.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i><sup>Attic in <a href="https://habr.com/company/vsce/blog/419267/">coworking SOK</a></sup></i></font> <br><br><hr><br><h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_q/wn/ud/_qwnudzzul0nb8sfiqfe7n1qfu0.png" width="20">  The rolex learning center </h5>  <font color="#A9A9A9">Francesco Della Casa, 2010</font> <br><br>  The Rolex Learning <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2010/02/17/rolex-learning-center-by-sanaa/">Center</a> is the campus and library of the Federal Polytechnic School of Lausanne (EPFL).

In it, the authors study how planning affects the productivity and psychological state of employees. <br><br>  The book has an example of a comfortable modern office.  This is the headquarters of Scandinavian Airlines in Stockholm, which was built in the 80s.  The campus <a href="https://scandinaviantraveler.com/en/aviation/1980s-sas-gets-a-new-home">consists</a> of low buildings on the bank of the pond, in which, besides the offices, there are cafes, shops and a fitness club.

One of the tasks that the author set himself, is to explain how co-working is different from designing traditional offices. <br><br><hr><br><h2><blockquote>  Space for remote work </blockquote></h2><br><hr><br><h5> <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Nomads-Temporary-Spaces-Life/dp/3899555589"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_q/wn/ud/_qwnudzzul0nb8sfiqfe7n1qfu0.png" width="20"></a></i>  <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Nomads-Temporary-Spaces-Life/dp/3899555589">The New Nomads: Temporary Spaces and a Life on the Move</a></i> </h5>  <i><font color="#A9A9A9">Robert Klanten, Sven Ehmann, Michelle Galindo, 2015</font></i> <br><br>  The book is devoted to the organization of jobs for "digital nomads" - people who prefer to work not in the office, but at home or traveling around the world.  Authors write about how people's homes and urban spaces change with the increasing popularity of this format of work. <br><br>  Particular attention is paid in the book to how the "nomads" adjust their way of life on the road - create temporary mini-homes or use multifunctional furniture, such as a bed-table.  The publication presents more than a hundred <a href="https://popupcity.net/the-new-nomads-temporary-spaces-and-a-life-on-the-move/">examples</a> like "home by bicycle". <br><br><hr><br><h5> <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Style-Coworking-Contemporary-Shared-Workspaces/dp/3791348574"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_q/wn/ud/_qwnudzzul0nb8sfiqfe7n1qfu0.png" width="20"></a></i>  <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Style-Coworking-Contemporary-Shared-Workspaces/dp/3791348574">The Style of Coworking: Contemporary Shared Workspaces</a></i> </h5>  <i><font color="#A9A9A9">Alice Davies, Kathryn Tollervey, 2013</font></i> <br><br>  The business consultant‚Äôs book, Alice Davis, analyzes the coworking industry.  It contains ideas for the design of workspaces of a new type and examples of co-working from different countries. <br><br>  One of them is the London office of the Google <a href="https://www.campus.co/london/en/about/">Campus</a> .  Working areas in coworking occupy five floors of the building and have an open layout.  There are campus and <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/232170/google-campus-jump-studios">separate</a> work areas built on the basis of freight containers, as well as space for lectures. <br><br>  In the reviews, the book is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Style-Coworking-Contemporary-Shared-Workspaces/dp/3791348574">praised</a> for a large number of illustrations, and it helped one of the readers to create a design of their own coworking. <br><br><hr><br><h4>  What else do I do on Habr√© and beyond: </h4><br><ul><li>  I record a podcast about editors and everyone who creates IT-content [ <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/podcast/glph-media/id1435713366">iTunes</a> ] [ <a href="http://vigorousspace.co/glph/1">Web</a> ] [ <a href="https://habr.com/users/glphmedia/">Habr</a> ] </li><li>  I am helping to select projects for technology festivals - I am one of the SXSW Pitch event and SXSW Release it event [ <a href="https://habr.com/company/vsce/blog/427965/">my story about the history of SXSW</a> ] </li><li>  About photo tours already said - here are compact examples in Insta [ <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BmtPTMagkG1/">SOK</a> ] [ <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BjvDKfhg1vp/">#tceh</a> ] [ <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BpfK4EcgAFk/">Key</a> ] </li><li>  I also write on Habr√© about the startup culture of <a href="https://habr.com/company/vsce/blog/429456/">the 30s</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/company/vsce/blog/431722/">40s</a> </li></ul><br><hr></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/434924/">https://habr.com/ru/post/434924/</a></p>
