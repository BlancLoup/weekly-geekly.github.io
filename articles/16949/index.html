  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to increase the number of downloads of your topic</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The post is dedicated to all designers and layout designers under WordPress. <br>  Sometimes I get discouraged by the fact that the designer is none of me, and the layout does not bring joy, but only a nervous tick.  Especially when you get everything in FireFox with high quality, and then you look at the site in IE.  You sit and sob quietly. <br>  Why am I writing this?  And the fact that if I were able to quickly and efficiently make themes for WordPress, it would be possible for Hoo how many backlinks, since no one bothers to insert a link to yourself in the footer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If you look at the statistics of the same <a href="http://themes.wordpress.net/" rel="nofollow">themes.wordpress.net</a> , then in the top of the topic with the number of downloads from 10,000 and more, and even if you estimate that only 1/10 of them will be installed, then ... 1000 sites with backlinks from EACH PAGE.  And what if the site is still going to be popular? <br>  And, best of all, the cost of it is minimal - to make a theme, place it in different bases and everything - sit, wait while they download.  And now I will give some tips that will increase the number of downloads and the quality of topics. <br>  <strong>Free and only free.</strong> <br><br>  Some dizigners believe that since they spent time creating the topic, you need to demand a money for downloading.  This is pretty stupid, given the variety of free themes that are freely available on the Internet. <br>  <strong>Non-standard approach.</strong> <br>  Often WordPress is accused of the fact that the sites made on it all look exactly the same.  Still, because most of the so-called.  designers do not bother, but simply edit the standard theme (maybe heard such a name - Kubrick).  Come up with something new and non-standard, such that at the first glance at the thumbnail I would like to "poke" the site. <br>  An excellent example of the ‚Äúnot like everyone‚Äù theme is the obscure site <a href="http://browsehappy.com/" rel="nofollow">http://browsehappy.com/</a> .  But you can't say at a glance that this is WordPress. <br>  <strong>Create thematic topics.</strong> <br>  Do not try to make an abstract theme ‚Äúfor everyone‚Äù, if you want your creation not only to be downloaded but also used, then a narrow subject is suitable for this as well as possible.  For example, I haven‚Äôt found a single WordPress theme for Harry Potter, and yet, with so many fans and blogs dedicated to it, the topic would be VERY popular.  Think about it:-) <br>  Or seasonal themes, as well as themes for such holidays as Christmas / New Year, they will definitely be downloaded, the main thing is that they have access to the right moment. <br>  <strong>Do not use cheap clipart.</strong> <br><br>  And here it‚Äôs not so much a matter of money as it‚Äôs about the quality of the pictures used in the subject.  It is sad to see a well-shaped theme, in which the images in the header are not clear or full of pixels.  Examine well what image compression formats are best for what, because we want the user to wait for the page to load. <br>  <strong>Try not to use plugins in your theme.</strong> <br>  Yes, sometimes you want to expand the functionality of your theme at the expense of plug-ins, but do not forget that the user who is going to use it will probably not have your set of plug-ins.  On the other hand, this does not prevent you from preparing your theme so that when certain plug-ins are activated, it responds adequately to this.  This is done by a simple check in the theme code and, accordingly, the output of additional code.  It is very convenient when working with popular plugins that can be styled under a theme, for example, the same <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-pagenavi/" rel="nofollow">Wp-PageNavi</a> .  The main thing is that it was ‚Äútransparent‚Äù for the end user and was a ‚Äúnice addition‚Äù, and not forced to download something else. <br>  <strong>Invest in source design theme.</strong> <br>  If you make it easy for some elements to be redrawn "by themselves", then the chances of seeing backlinks increase.  It is not necessary to lay out the psd of the entire design, but such elements as logo, background images, etc.  can be put in a separate folder in the subject.  People will be grateful, believe me, I myself am glad if I find the sources of individual elements in the archive. <br>  <strong>Make a topic in multiple languages.</strong> <br>  Usually, there are not so many elements in the topics that require translation, and for a knowledgeable person the translation takes about half an hour of power.  Only here such knowledgeable people are usually not so much.  A regular user immediately falls into a stupor when, when the theme is activated, he sees the text in a non-native language.  I judge this by the number of topics with the question: ‚Äúhow can I translate a topic‚Äù / ‚Äúlocalize me a topic‚Äù in different forums. <br>  If you take care of this in advance, then multiply the number of downloads.  Moreover, all text elements in 90% of cases are the same in all topics, so you can make a stub from .MO files in different languages ‚Äã‚Äãand attach them to the archive.

      <strong>Be more diverse in design and colors.</strong> <br>  Nowadays minimalism is popular in everything, including in color design.  Most of them come across themes in black and white or blue and blue.  This is boring.  Make a high-quality pink theme with flowers, and you will be grateful to a fair amount of bloggers-housewives, and they don‚Äôt know exactly how to remove your backlink from the footer <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fe4/9f7/da7/fe49f7da71ed2fdb0ee5850d9cecdd9e.gif" alt=";-)"><br>  Agree, <a href="http://www.ndesign-studio.com/" rel="nofollow">this site</a> looks more than nice. <br>  <strong>Be careful with sponsorship.</strong> <br>  A couple of times came across themes with already built-in adsense blocks of the author.  He laughed for a long time, cutting them out from source.  First, I heard somewhere that Google may well ban an account if clicks come from unknown sites, and second, have a conscience. <br>  And you should not shove 10 links into the footer, in the hope of raising the issue to your various projects.  Such blocks with 100% probability will be erased, so that you do not even get links to yourself.  Be modest and be content with small ... in large quantities. <br>  <strong>Check out the theme in popular browsers.</strong> <br><br>  This is a very important point, which many people forget.  It is not necessary to fall into hysteria and test it in all existing browsers, four is enough: IE6, IE7, FireFox and Opera.  Or use the service <a href="http://www.browsershots.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.browsershots.org/</a> . <br>  <strong>Place the topic in directories.</strong> <br>  It is not enough to post a topic in my blog, you also need to notify popular (and not so) directories about it.  Most of them can be found by simply typing <a href="http://www.google.ru/search%3Fq%3Dwordpress%2Bthemes" rel="nofollow">wordpress themes</a> in Google.  If the catalog does not have a free opportunity to add a theme, then send it by mail to the administrator, because posting new interesting topics is not only in your interests, but in the interests of the catalog. <br>  When registering, indicate in the title the most popular words related to the subject, as well as register in several categories at once, in order to get into the issue with the maximum probability. <br>  <strong>Do not forget to take a screenshot.</strong> <br>  When I see the ‚ÄúScreenshot is not available‚Äù preview, I don‚Äôt even click on the demo link to see how the theme looks in action.  The same applies to the pictures, where instead of the thumbnail just the title of the topic is written.  When I choose a topic, I want at least approximately to imagine that I will see, and not waste time in vain. <br>  <strong>Do not forget to update threads</strong> . <br><br>  In WordPress 2.3, embedded tags appeared, an excellent reason to refresh the theme, and add to the description of Wordpress 2.3 ready or tags included.  In general, the more complete the description and the number of ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù in it are, the better. <br><br>  Well, that's all that occurred to me.  If you make high-quality topics, you can leave links in the comments, suddenly I will like it, I promise in this case leave a link on you ;-) <br>  <a href="http://www.cybercore.ru/kak-povysit-kolichestvo-skachivajnij-vashej-temy/">Original article "How to increase the number of downloads of your topic"</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/16949/">https://habr.com/ru/post/16949/</a></p>
