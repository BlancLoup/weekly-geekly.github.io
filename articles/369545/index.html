      It was decided to write an article including answers to such questions.  The purpose of the material is to show how such antennas work on the example of their own products and to help you choose the right antenna for receiving the Internet signal in your particular situation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Introduction</b> <br><br>  Antennas are an integral part of any wireless device.  Due to the trend to reduce the size of consumer electronics devices, antennas are subject to stringent requirements.  Under the antenna on the PCB a small area is allocated (10% or less of the board area).  Sometimes, antennas on flexible printed circuit boards ( <abbr title="Flexible Printed Circuit Board">FPCB)</abbr> are <abbr title="Flexible Printed Circuit Board">used</abbr> , which allows the device to be assembled not only in the plane, but also in the volume of the case.  It happens, the engineers simply place a ‚Äúsquiggle‚Äù on the board (for example, a <abbr title="Planar Inverted-F Antenna">PIFA antenna</abbr> ), which is responsible for the operation of the device in 2G, 3G, 4G networks.  Such an antenna is non-directional, with a minimum gain, its efficiency is low. <br><br>  Yes, such technical solutions are focused mainly on the operation of the device in areas of reliable signal reception.  But, sometimes we find ourselves in areas with poor coverage, where the built-in antenna is not enough.  In such cases, an external antenna can help out. <br><br>  Depending on the device used (smartphone, tablet, modem), you will need an antenna, the functionality of which is implemented for a specific device.  We <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/remo/blog/275646">talked about the</a> Orange-900 and Orange-2600 Internet signal amplification systems, which improve the communication quality of a smartphone / tablet, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/remo/blog/275646">earlier</a> .  Now we will look at ways to amplify the signal of the mobile Internet modem, for example, a few classic antenna options. <br><br>  <b>Reflector antennas</b> <br><br>  See how the modem emits (receives a signal) in the 4G-band: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fe0/966/d3e/fe0966d3eb154757bb13efa3acf468d6.jpg" alt="image">  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>1 - Computer simulation of 4G-modem 3D radiation pattern (f = 2.6GHz)</i> <br><br>  In Fig.  Figure 1 shows the 3D pattern of the modem at an operating frequency of 2.6 GHz (4G network).  Let's take a closer look at it.  As you can see, the built-in antenna of the modem radiates around 360 degrees across the horizon with a slight intrinsic gain.  The distortion of radiation over the horizon is due to the design of the modem antenna ‚Äî the antenna model of one of the previously popular modems, for clarity, placed in a radio transparent case, is taken as a basis. <br><br>  The advantages of circular radiation include the fact that the user does not need to look for a direction on the <abbr title="Base Station">BS</abbr> ‚Äî the modem will choose the BS it needs.  However, by receiving from all directions, in addition to the useful signal, such an antenna will receive interference and noise from other transmitters, which will worsen the ratio of useful signal to noise ( <abbr title="Signal / Noise">S / N</abbr> ).  This ratio affects the "ping" and connection speed: the larger it is, the smaller the "ping" and the higher the speed of data exchange. <br><br>  In order to increase the S / N ratio of the modem, you can use the Connect 3.0 Internet signal amplifier - this is a two-element antenna consisting of a reflector and an active element (a modem that is inserted into a special holder).  The amplifier itself (if we understand an active device as an amplifier) ‚Äã‚Äãis not here, as in any passive antenna, however, speaking of amplification, first of all we are talking about the directional properties of the antenna, and the brighter they are expressed, the more this ‚Äúgain‚Äù the antenna gives . <br><br>  For basic setup, it is enough to direct the amplifier with a modem towards the best signal level in the room (as a rule this window) and the connection quality will improve.  In a computer model, it happens like this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/79b/90a/b90/79b90ab906ef4be68902eac05d47c7e5.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>2 - Computer simulation of 4G-modem 3D pattern</i> <i><br></i>  <i>in the Connect 3.0 amplifier (f = 2.6GHz)</i> <br>  In Fig.  2 modem radiation in the direction of Connect 3.0 is now more pronounced, with the red color (emission maximum) becoming brighter, indicating an acquired directivity (gain).  The right side of the picture shows the gain color scale, according to which you can imagine in which direction the modem radiation is maximum. <br><br>  Using Connect 3.0 reflector, the modem‚Äôs built-in antenna acquired directional properties, resulting in an increased antenna gain of 6.5 dBi (1 dBi - decibel relative to an isotropic radiation source), and the modem input became less susceptible to noise and interference, which increases the S / N ratio and improves the quality of internet connection. <br><br>  Important: the modems of different antenna models are completely differently placed, their designs are different, therefore the amplification effect can be different in quantitative measure, however, the radiation pattern in all cases will take on a similar appearance, which is important for improving the S / N ratio. <br><br>  You can assemble and adjust such a reflector yourself, for example, from a regular beer can.  This is curious for DIY lovers, and, yes, it will also work towards gain.  One ‚Äúbut‚Äù - beer can not always look aesthetically and presentably at home, in the office, in the store. <br><br>  A small FAQ on antenna reflectors: <br><br>  <b>Question: In the technical specifications you write that the antenna supports almost all communication standards - how is it possible to achieve such broadband? "</b> <br><br>  Answer: since Connect 3.0 is a two-element antenna, the active element of which is a modem, it all depends on whether the modem supports the desired standard.  The size and location of the reflector, hidden in Connect Connect plastic case, allows the antenna to have a positive effect in such a wide frequency range. <br><br>  <b>Question: ‚ÄúWhy is the antenna worth just that much (substitute any price here)?</b>  <b>To sell stamped plastic and foil for such money is a fraud "</b> <br><br>  Answer: Despite the relative simplicity of the design - the antenna works, performs the stated function, which is confirmed by hundreds of thousands of manufactured products and a lot of positive feedback from our customers.  We consider it wrong to discuss the issue of economics and calculating the cost of this product, relying only on the prices of materials included in its cost.  Unfortunately, there are many factors of final pricing, often not dependent on us. <br><br>  <b>Directional antenna.</b> <br><br>  There are situations when the ‚ÄúConnect 3.0‚Äù level solutions are not enough to ‚Äúreach‚Äù the modem to the BS signal at a distance of several kilometers.  Here we will be helped by directional antennas like "wave channel" and panel patch antennas.  These antennas have excellent reception characteristics in the operating range and will help to establish a stable connection in conditions of poor signal reception (of course, if there is one at all). <br><br>  Modern networks of 2-4 generations use a wide range of frequencies: from 800 to 2700 MHz, which is very difficult to cover with one directional antenna with the same parameters in the entire working band, but this is not necessary.  You just need to choose the right antenna for your situation, knowing that if you have a 3G antenna, then it will not help if you want to catch a WiFi network or, for example, an LTE-2600 network. <br><br>  It should be clarified: due to the specificity of the frequency distribution, in Russia there are parts of the ranges in which networks of different generations are placed (the principle of technological neutrality), such as GSM 1800 (2G) and LTE 1800 (4G), for which the same antenna fits at 1800 MHz, but there are few such examples. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cbf/dc2/209/cbfdc2209dae40b98736718cf01dc49c.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>3 - 3G / 4G / WiFi panel antenna "Flat Combi"</i> <br><br>  When is more necessary a panel antenna, and when is a wave channel antenna necessary?  The panel antenna (Example in Fig. 3) has a wide operating frequency range and is easier to tune to a base station.  The ‚ÄúWave channel‚Äù antenna (Example in Fig. 4) is narrower - they usually work well in the same band (2G, 3G, 4G), but have a greater gain.  Panel antennas are less susceptible to mechanical damage and ‚Äúraven attacks‚Äù due to their streamlined shape.  And the ‚Äúwave channels‚Äù, due to their narrowband, are less susceptible to interference and interference from other signal sources, which has a positive effect on the S / N ratio.  Antennas are equipped with SMA, N or FME connectors, so in order to connect them to a modem, you need to use an adapter on a CRC-9 or TS-9 connector, depending on the modem. <br><br>  Now let's discuss the location of outdoor antennas.  3G networks use vertical polarization, antennas should be placed elements perpendicular to the ground.  This is written in the passport of the product and on the manufacturers' websites, but not all read the instructions, therefore, often installed communication antennas, like traditional television antennas horizontally.  The result is that the antenna in this position either does not work at all, or almost does not work. <br><br>  The 4G / LTE standard has a different polarization.  For better reception, the antenna should be placed at an angle of 45 degrees to the horizon. <br><br>  <b>Question: Do these antennas <abbr title="Multiple input Multiple output">support MiMo</abbr> technology?</b> <br><br>  Answer: Support.  To work with MiMo technology, you will need 2 antennas.  For example, to support LTE MiMo, we recommend using 2 wave channels located at angles of +45 and ‚àí45 degrees to the horizon. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d81/5b9/496/d815b94966854226ab28f97bb74a9dfb.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>4 - Antenna "wave channel" for 4G networks "Lynx 4G"</i> <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  Choosing an antenna, decide on what kind of signal you want to amplify.  For clarity, we present a summary table with the characteristics of the antennas under consideration: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a7/570/279/3a757027955b4c5e833e9c233f79d4e9.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We thank you for your attention.
