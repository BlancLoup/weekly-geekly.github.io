  <section class="page js-page"><h1>General Motors and IBM have developed a multimedia system with artificial intelligence for cars.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e91/0c1/08b/e910c108b8c5444d913ee24994152561.jpg"><br>  The other day, General Motors and IBM have agreed to work together on a smart multimedia system for cars, which will be based on the IBM Watson cognitive platform.  General Motors has its own OnStar multimedia system, which is compatible with IBM Watson, giving millions of GM car drivers the opportunity to use the smart system in their car.  The novelty will be called OnStarGo. <br><br>  According to the developers, as a result, both drivers and passengers will be able to feel safe in their car.  The system will help to avoid traffic jams, which is especially important if you run out of fuel, show where you can drink coffee nearby, or tell about the latest news on the way to work. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúOn average, Americans spend about 46 minutes a day in the car, and they don‚Äôt want to consider this time lost.  Using the capabilities of OnStar and Watson, we can provide safer, simpler and higher-quality solutions for motorists, ‚Äùsays Phil Abram, executive director of GM Connected Products and Strategy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c5/ed2/6f6/7c5ed26f6c804503a1e0edfe9ef6b39c.jpg">

      The new interactive system will be able to predict the actions of the driver, analyzing his way of driving and habits.  To help the car owner, the system is provided with access to a huge database, in which almost everything that can be useful for a motorist is added - from parking locations to information about new traffic jams. <br><br>  Several new services will be connected to OnStar Go, including ProactiveAlerts.  They will help expand the functionality and capabilities of the digital motorist assistant.  For example, the mentioned Proactive Alerts service will be able to warn the owner of the car about the discharge of the battery, even if the person is outside the car.  For this message will be sent by SMS or e-mail. <br><br>  If the car owner has children, OnStar Go will warn you about the need to purchase baby food.  Want to eat?  Also not a problem - the system will show where there are popular cafes.  With the help of OnStar Go, a motorist will be able to buy the goods he needs right in the car, as well as pay for fuel without leaving the salon.  The problem with parking is also easy to solve - a smart system will tell you about the closest available places in the desired area. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIBM and GM want to improve the interaction between man and car, to make it more efficient.  The combination of IBM Watson and <a href="https://www.onstar.com/us/en/home.html">OnStar</a> will provide cars with ‚Äúsmart‚Äù features, ‚Äùsays Paul Pappas, a spokesman for the IBM iX. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a5d/b27/570/a5db27570ee04dc4a7f841eeacae0e2d.jpg"><br><br>  Such companies as Exxon Mobil, Glympse, iHeart Radio, Mastercard and Parkopedia have already expressed their desire to take part in this project. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Exxon Mobil will help motorists find gas stations, advise the best fuel and consumables for a particular car.  Motorists will be able to pay for washing or refueling remotely; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Mastercard ensures fast payments for goods or services.  The OnStar platform added not only the capabilities of IBM Watson, but also several Mastercard services, including the <a href="https://www.mastercard.us/en-us/issuers/products-and-solutions/grow-manage-your-business/digital-commerce-solutions.html">Mastercard Digital EnablementService (MDES)</a> - and <a href="https://masterpass.com/us/">Masterpass</a> ; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Parkopedia will provide the motorist with information about nearby parking lots and free places on them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399085/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399085/</a></p>
