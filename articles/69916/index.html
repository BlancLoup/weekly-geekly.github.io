  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The benefits of time spent behind an RSS reader</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Most of us are subscribed to many blogs and other resources of various subjects.  In itself, the constant reading of any garbage instead of working at least causes discontent of the boss.  Check every three and a half minutes and whether something new has appeared somewhere on the Internet says either about the fascination (or rather, its absence) of the current work, or about the progressive bad habit.  Nevertheless, even a quick review of RSS content over the last couple of hours of hard work during a break sometimes causes the hidden anger of some employees. <br><br>  So, is rss a universal evil?  Not really, from my personal experience, I will write why. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I will not say <i>(although there, I already wrote this)</i> that RSS at least saves me from checking hundreds of blogs manually, and I remember the time when it was the only way to get information.  It's not about that. <br><br>  Remember, in childhood, parents were forced to read books?  Imagination develops there and all the cases.  That's all, childhood is over, the books remain only <a href="http://oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a> publishers, and now they read blogs.  What is the practical meaning of the books?  Books are food for the mind, not otherwise.  It is known that with repeated repetition of some actions, these actions are ‚Äúrecorded‚Äù in the brain and get from memory easier, faster and often automatically.  With a single action, such as reading a book, you are unlikely to recall some details after some time, but the ideas that the author tried to convey to you will remain in memory for a long time, and very likely will be used later in creative activity.  This is where the development of the imagination.

      With modern blogs, you can draw an analogy to books.  You are reading a short article in which the author is trying to convey to you some idea or to share life experience.  Experience and the idea can be useful and useless, useful blogs eventually begin to read more people, useless nobody needs, nobody reads, and the author has an innocent useless activity and does not go at night to set fire to homeless people - also quite good for himself. <br><br>  Blogs are a source of information on any topic, 98% of which you don‚Äôt need right now.  And reading unnecessary information quite looks like an unnecessary action.  But let me give a few examples from life.  I was convinced from my experience that this seemingly unnecessary information is quite tangible in the near future. <br><br>  * With a person with diverse interests, it is nice to find common topics for conversation, how many times I was rescued by a dull, uncomfortable silence that a few days ago I read a seemingly unnecessary article on a particular topic. <br>  * Sometimes, only knowing that something theoretically exists, you can greatly facilitate your life.  Examples of mass, mainly in IT.  You can not imagine how often you have to throw links to blog posts in especially ardent cycloisparties. <br>  * Someone else's experience you may need.  For example, when faced with another IDE jamb at work, I remembered that I had already seen something like that somewhere.  And yes, the necessary article with a recipe for solving the problem was quickly found. <br>  * Someone else's negative (sometimes fatal) experience will also pop up in memory to warn you about how to do something.  An example was only recently, when I almost fell for a divorce, about which I read somewhere in the context of numerous murders by a certain gang. <br>  * Finally, even bayans from a bashorg can entertain not very active Internet users. <br><br>  Different companies have a different attitude towards ‚Äúspending time on blogs,‚Äù instead of working.  It is clear that an employee who does nothing at all but a constant update of the RSS reader is a clear candidate for dismissal.  But sometimes it goes to the extreme, forbidding everything around at all (I‚Äôll ban for VKontakte).  But, at least I need breaks in hard work (yes, I often work hard), and I do not smoke.  So I can't go to the corridor every 15 minutes and spend the next 15 minutes doing nothing. <br><br>  And yes, now I have a break and I am writing this article. <br><br>  <i>If the whole post looks like an excuse for the blog addiction, then it‚Äôs probably time for me to get rid of this addiction, and the text is nothing more than an addict‚Äôs attempt to justify himself in the first place.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/69916/">https://habr.com/ru/post/69916/</a></p>
