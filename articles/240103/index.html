In fact, what could be more familiar to flying on the Soyuz to the ISS, if this event occurs in reality four times a year?  The excellent quality of add-ons that were made by enthusiasts promises a lot of positive emotions, and the MCC archives with information about real flight allow you to dive deeper into the atmosphere of modern cosmonautics. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  A warning </h4><br>  This flight is difficult for beginners.

    <h4>  Flight plan </h4><br><ol><li>  Start from the Earth. </li><li>  Rendezvous maneuvers with the ISS. </li><li>  Rapprochement and docking. </li><li>  Return to Earth. </li></ol><br><br><h4>  Flight preparation </h4><br>  For the flight we need: <br><ol><li>  <a href="http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/download.html">Orbiter</a> . </li><li>  Addon <a href="http://www.orbithangar.com/searchid.php%3FID%3D4545">Soyuz FG / U v1.2</a> . </li><li>  Addon <a href="http://orbithangar.com/searchid.php%3FID%3D3737">International Space Station v.3.2</a> . </li><li>  Addon <a href="http://orbithangar.com/searchid.php%3FID%3D2139">Aerobrake MFD</a> . </li><li>  Addon <a href="http://www.orbithangar.com/searchid.php%3FID%3D4247">Baikonur Surface Tiles v1.1</a> (optional). </li></ol><br><br><h4>  Installation and Setup </h4><br>  Addons are installed in the following order: first Soyuz FG / U, second ISS.  Archives simply unzip to the Orbiter folder. <br>  If you want to set the texture of Baikonur and make the start more beautiful: <br><ol><li>  Unpack textures into Orbiter's textures folder. </li><li>  Add the lines from the readme to the baikonur.cfg file not in <i>ORBITER \ CONFIG \ EARTH \ BASE</i> , but in <b>Orbiter \ Config \ Earth \ M.</b>  The fact is that ISS scripts use a ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù solar system with different configuration files. </li></ol><br>  Make sure the Limited fuel option is set in the Parameters tab. <br>  Orbiter will show the program error window after exiting the script.  If this is annoying, in the Extra tab - Debugging options - Orbiter shutdown options, select the Respawn Orbiter process mode. <br>  In order for the Soyuz not to fall apart when landing on a ballistic descent, open the <b>Orbiter \ Scenarios \ International Space Station \ 2006 \ 052</b> folder <b>.</b>  <b>Soyuz TMA - 8 is the</b> only file found there in any text editor and delete the <b>ALLOW_BALLISTIC</b> line.  Otherwise, because of the bug, the "Union" will always go into a ballistic descent instead of a controlled one when landing. <br><br><h4>  Stage 1. Starting from Earth </h4><br>  I chose the flight scenario of the Soyuz TMA-8, mainly because it is one of the last in the collection of scenarios (the ISS is already quite large), and the launch takes place during the day.  In principle, no one bothers you to choose any other scenario of the "Union". <br>  Soyuz TMA-8 was launched on March 30, 2006 with a crew from cosmonaut Roscosmos Pavel Vinogradov, NASA astronaut Jeffrey Williams and first Brazilian cosmonaut Marcos Pontes ( <a href="http://www.mcc.rsa.ru/www_old/tma8/ekip.htm">brief biographies page</a> ): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e7b/0f8/aec/e7b0f8aec4934e2da0b9b8b1b4df9a37.jpg"><br>  <i>Start early in the morning, so this photo is still night</i> <br><br>  Start and launch occur fully automatically.  The only note is that in order to avoid glitches, I do not advise putting acceleration time greater than <b>x10</b> on launch, and more than <b>x100</b> in all subsequent <b>flights</b> . <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/7AJjRyTWFF4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjAQc8kQcoeVmjUsFa-OcY_17cB5Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Real start</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa4/45d/46c/fa445d46cf244b9d972a6876afac0c63.jpg"><br>  <i>And orbiter</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/649/034/e90/649034e9098d4ca6a97b239fddf6ae67.jpg"><br>  <i>And such frames are only in the simulator.</i>  <i>The third stage after separation drains tanks, moving away from the newly withdrawn "Union"</i> <br><br>  I recommend to save the script by <b>Ctrl-S</b> .

Maneuvers for the rendezvous with the ISS </h4><br>  So, we are in orbit, the solar panels and antennas are open, we begin the path to the ISS.  First of all, it is necessary to note the features of the Soyuz spacecraft in the simulator: <br>  The ship has four additional information screens that can be switched using the <b>U</b> button: <br><br>  <b>Movement Screen:</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f1/fec/ab2/7f1fecab262846baa953f9fd14b9aa5f.jpg"><br>  This screen displays: <br><ul><li>  Mode of operation of shunting engines (RCS, they are also DPO).  Engines can operate with pulses of 0.05;  0.1;  0.25 seconds and in continuous mode.  Switching between modes using the <b>M</b> button </li><li>  Mode of operation of the main engine (KTDU).  Possible modes: 300 Newtons thrust, 700 N, 6197 N. Switching between <b>Ctrl-E</b> modes. </li><li>  The status of the main engine cover.  It must be opened before turning on KTDU.  Opening and closing the lid - button <b>E.</b> </li><li> Fuel stock in kilograms and percentages. </li></ul><br>  <b>Electrical system and control screen</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/526/d20/68a/526d2068a41f4b8499a160a6769e6cc8.jpg"><br>  This screen displays: <br><ul><li>  Status of antennas and solar panels. </li><li>  Management mode status. </li><li>  Headlights mode.  Turn on / off <b>Alt-L</b> , turn on / off automatic headlight <b>mode Ctlr-L</b> . </li><li>  The remainder of the battery charge and mode of operation of solar panels.  If the batteries are dead, the ship will lose control! </li></ul><br>  <b>Docking screen</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/631/4c9/4b5/6314c94b5d544c299598d0d61c9b2f7d.jpg"><br>  It contains useful data on the orientation and speed of rotation of the ship, as well as on the state of the docking pin. <br><br>  <b>Blank screen</b> <br>  In this mode, additional information is not displayed and can not prevent other MFD. <br><br>  The general rule of flights on the "Union" - <b>not in a hurry, do not abuse the automatic modes of maintaining orientation, save fuel</b> . <br>  It is better to turn around in two or three minutes with a couple of pulses than to spend a few kilograms of fuel on an automatic turn. <br>  Pulse mode is very unusual for Orbiter, and it practically does not occur in other ships, so you need to get used to it. <br>  Also in the control keys there is a very non-ergonomic key that interferes with the role-making component - depressurization of the household compartment (normally done before separating the compartments at the landing stage) - button <b>A</b> without any modifiers.  Inadvertent pressing (and on Shift-A the MFD of orbital alignment is called) - and the depressurization of the household compartment makes it impossible for the normal role-playing continuation of further flight. <br><br><h5>  The combination of the planes of the orbits </h5><br>  Let's look at the <a href="http://www.mcc.rsa.ru/www_old/tma8/start.htm">parameters of the real flight orbit</a> : <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Parameter </th><th>  Real value </th><th>  Value in simulator </th></tr><tr><td>  Apocenter </td><td>  242 (¬± 42) km </td><td>  245 km </td></tr><tr><td>  Pericenter </td><td>  200 km (+ 7 / -22) km </td><td>  195 km </td></tr><tr><td>  Orbit inclination </td><td>  51.67 ¬∞ ¬± 0.058 ¬∞ </td><td>  51.60 ¬∞ </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  If it were not for the inclination error, the elimination would be almost perfect.  And so we have to first combine the orbits of the "Union" and the ISS: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99d/5a4/e7f/99d5a4e7f18d42008611aee27bdc87b0.jpg"><br><br>  Whole half a degree.  Too much, but nowhere to go.  I propose to perform a correction on the first turn (in <a href="http://www.mcc.rsa.ru/www_old/tma8/start.htm">reality, the</a> first maneuver was carried out four hours after the start).  The next node is ascending, which means that it will be necessary to deploy the ship "down" from the plane of the orbit.  Do not forget to open the lid of the KTDU a few minutes before the knot - firstly, it blocks the engine start, and secondly, the MFD with the lid closed cannot calculate the pulse duration.  Let us recall the rule of thumb - the engine starts at the moment when half of the estimated time of engine operation remains before the node: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/841/941/978/84194197878b4ea59f209d43af30426c.jpg"><br>  <i>Begin maneuver</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4fe/f06/568/4fef06568af04763ab879b4fcfd17545.jpg"><br>  <i>Result</i> <br><br>  At the end of the maneuver, it is worthwhile to work by shunting engines for the maximum combination of orbits.  Please note that we have spent as much as 20% of the fuel. <br>  After the maneuver, I recommend to transfer the APS to the minimum pulse mode, turn on the automatic system for maintaining solar orientation (it is quite economical) with the <b>K</b> button and save the script. <br><br><h5>  Synchronization of the orbit with the ISS </h5><br>  We look at the parameters of the orbit of the "Union" and the ISS according to the MFD "Orbit": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b6/18e/85e/2b618e85e5794209b2794021cfe15c3d.jpg"><br><br>  Between us and the ISS is almost half a turn (the so-called phase angle).  This was done specifically so that in two days of flight (I‚Äôm reminding you, 2006 is the year, there is no talk of a six-hour docking scheme yet) "Union" could not hurry to catch up with the ISS. <br>  How will we synchronize the orbit?  I propose to divide it into the following stages: <br><ol><li>  Wait until the phase angle decreases. </li><li>  Raise the apocenter to the intersection with the ISS orbit.  I recommend performing the maneuver in the apocenter of the current orbit in order to minimize the difference in velocity between us and the ISS.  If we raise the apocenter from the pericenter of the current orbit, then at the apocenter our speed will be noticeably lower, and the difference between the almost constant speed of the ISS in a circular orbit will be greater. </li><li>  Synchronize orbits, raising pericenter. </li><li>  Perform a deceleration maneuver relative to the ISS in the near zone. </li></ol><br>  <b>Looking forward to reducing the phase angle</b> . <br>  Patience is one of the essential qualities of real astronauts.  You are waiting for a space flight and are preparing for several years (especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_L._Lind">bad luck astronauts have</a> been waiting for their flight for 19 years!), Wait a couple of days in orbit - this is nonsense.  We are planning a maneuver in the MFD "Go": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/971/3c1/025/9713c10255fe405d951e305db1064312.jpg"><br>  <i>March 30, 03:52 UTC, ends the first round</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea8/205/ab1/ea8205ab1fd8457ea174b7423c564f02.jpg"><br>  <i>March 30, 19:40 UTC, it's time to get ready for the maneuver</i> <br>  A word of advice: it will be easier to prepare for the maneuver if you are not in a hurry to orient the ship on the opposite side of the orbit against the orbital velocity vector (for braking).  After half a turn of the "Union" "he" will take almost the right position, which will remain only slightly adjusted. <br>  The result of the maneuver on MFD ‚ÄúTransition‚Äù is not clearly visible - the lines merge.  Switch to MFD "Orbit Synchronization": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db4/dc9/e72/db4dc9e722cd4a9a8a47d4312ca36db5.jpg"><br><br>  Not bad, we have four more orbits to prepare for the synchronization of the orbits.  Turn on the orientation mode on the Sun again and wait: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/01f/49c/7e3/01f49c7e3e4b48019494c18bf73fcaaf.jpg"><br><br>  Our task is to raise the pericenter to reduce the parameter DTmin to zero: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a1f/30e/c8a/a1f30ec8acc847a582c9f2ffee38504b.jpg"><br><br>  Convergence and docking - through the coil.  Funny, the time counter shows that instead of a real two-day scheme, it turned out to be one-day ‚Äî that was how the Soyuz once flew to the Salyut orbital stations.  The scheme is not very successful - by the end of the first day, the period of adaptation to weightlessness is the brightest, and 40-60% of the crew (according to statistics) suffer from nausea.  But we are not threatened in virtual flight, so feel free to go to the dock. <br><br>  Required docking preparation operations: <br>  <b>Find out which node we are connecting to</b> .  Historically, the Soyuz TMA-8 interfaced to the nadir node of the Zarya module, in the numbering of the script it is node number 1. <br>  <b>Set up MFD "Docking"</b> .  We turn on the MFD ‚ÄúDocking‚Äù, select the first docking station and output the data to the ILS. <br>  <b>Turn off the orientation system of the ISS.</b>  Press <b>F3 to</b> open the ships menu and select ISS.  Pressing the <b>End</b> button above the block of cursor keys turns off the orientation system.  Switching screens similarly to the "Union" for <b>U</b> make sure that the system is turned off: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/390/eaf/e58/390eafe58a084ed2975c65ebd337784a.jpg"><br><br>  Now the ISS has ceased to turn slowly around its axis, and we can calmly dock. <br>  <b>Calculate the start of braking</b> .  On the one hand, we do not want to crash into the ISS.  But, on the other hand, we do not want to slow down too far, so that we do not have to spend the fuel again on acceleration, braking and orientation.  Using only the school formulas of acceleration, speed and distance traveled, not taking into account fuel consumption and weight reduction of the ship, we get the following simple sign, which tells us at what distance to start braking for a given rendezvous speed: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a0a/f8c/cf1/a0af8ccf174a4939a180e79c5029d956.jpg"><br>  Please note that with a speed difference of 100 m / s, only 6 km is enough, and with a speed difference of 200 m / s, 23 km is needed!  Therefore, we did our best to reduce the speed difference earlier in the script. <br><br><h4>  Stage 3. Close and docking </h4><br>  Here is a diagram of the real convergence and docking of the Soyuz TMA-8 <a href="http://www.mcc.rsa.ru/www_old/tma8/start.htm">from here</a> : <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/32e/64e/e04/32e64ee047f54a12b16bb1ba1cf8c627.gif"><br><br>  We, of course, have other flight parameters, because we performed other maneuvers.  But from this picture there is one useful advice - it is more convenient to dock during the day. <br>  And we are also approaching the ISS: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/787/c49/a6c/787c49a6c47b496e92de9318cac42868.jpg"><br><br>  The range of 30 km, it is time to turn against the velocity vector relative to the ISS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eac/84a/9cb/eac84a9cb88c40b496b25db55be27cf9.jpg"><br><br>  The distance is 3 km, the speed of approach is 20 m / s.  If you look again at the real docking scheme, we go at the same speed, the MCC will not penalize us for speeding and dangerous maneuvers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/83e/5da/3ea/83e5da3ead544ceaaa4dec13a42c1698.jpg"><br><br>  The range of 1.2 km.  The ISS is clearly discernible and is approaching simply with frightening speed.  The only thing that reassures is that it‚Äôs clear that we are a little overshooting and flying a little to the side, and not hitting the station. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5fa/794/610/5fa7946101764a1487d6082675d9f821.jpg"><br><br>  I started to slow down with 400 m, let it be a small margin.  Distance 200 m, relative speed 0. If you have night, it is better to wait for the exit from the shadow of the Earth - it will be more convenient to dock. <br><br><h5>  Docking </h5><br>  And where, strictly speaking, is the nadir docking assembly of the Zarya module?  Here is a photo of the ISS of July 2006 from the Space Shuttle mission STS-121: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/508/48b/e9f/50848be9f19844ad8067504e404cdf10.jpg"><br><br>  This photograph was taken from the opposite side of the ISS relative to the previous picture.  Thus, we now need to move back and down ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ISS_configuration_2011-05_en.svg">where the ISS is up, down, right and left</a> ), turn the ship with the docking station up and proceed to docking.  I remind you that we have not so much fuel, so it is worth maneuvering carefully and not in a hurry. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/067/49c/9b4/06749c9b40a9467d897558be92c4d7c6.jpg"><br><br>  ISS is much smaller than today, but still impressive. <br>  Turn off the MFD with the <b>PWR</b> button on the screen, transfer the additional information screen to the docking mode, select the docking target (ISS) using <b>Ctrl-O</b> , press the <b>O</b> button to select port 0 (obviously, the IT people did the script, just numbering from zero start :)) and release the docking pin the <b>Y</b> button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/15a/642/1ad/15a6421adf9749959c354d0c46b553da.jpg"><br><br>  The nadir assembly of the Zarya module is indicated by an arrow.  But our task is to aim not directly at him, but at a <a href="http://rsc-etestpilot.blogspot.ru/2014/01/blog-post.html">target for manual docking</a> .  The point is that the point from which we are looking is located at the site of the periscope, and we see a picture, as if we were looking at the FAC (special space viewfinder).  The ‚Äúpoint of view‚Äù of the periscope is slightly away from the node, so we must aim at a special target.  The main trouble is that the target may not be visible, and even the included headlamp does not illuminate it.  If you do not understand how and where to aim, turn on the MFD ‚ÄúDocking‚Äù again, everything becomes clearer with it.  Here is the correct position: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e30/f2c/268/e30f2c2686c04ef48a88fca1c461451e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aab/5ad/4b5/aab5ad4b56ee407e927ddd1e664ff788.jpg"><br>  <i>Appearance</i> <br><br>  There is a dock!  What is especially nice - the fuel is still 513 kg, as much as 58%! <br><br><h4>  Stage 4. Return to Earth </h4><br>  For a successful and comfortable return to Earth, we need the coincidence of the following parameters: <br><ul><li>  Landing site "Union" is on the trajectory of motion. </li><li>  In the place of landing day, or, even better, evening.  Not that it was necessary, just more convenient. </li></ul><br>  On the MFD "Map" it looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/02a/847/ab1/02a847ab19b040f19df1fa32a086e24d.jpg"><br><br>  We undock from the ISS via <b>Ctrl-D</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c1f/ccc/481/c1fccc4819d54911b0a373507a04207f.jpg"><br><br>  We look at the landing scheme of the real ‚ÄúSoyuz TMA-8‚Äù and the <a href="http://www.mcc.rsa.ru/www_old/tma8/shema.htm">coordinates of the landing stages</a> : <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/11e/9fd/f2f/11e9fdf2fd9c407fb93de8d729532bc9.gif"><br>  It is important for us that the longitude of the start of braking is 324 ¬∞, i.e.  36 ¬∞ west longitude.  The longitude of the landing site is 67 ¬∞, so the Soyuz begins to slow down ~ 100 ¬∞ degrees to the landing site. <br>  Preparing for landing.  Turn on MFD ‚ÄúAerodynamic braking‚Äù, select ‚ÄúSoyuz Landing Site‚Äù as the target and switch it to map mode.  Orient the ship against the orbital velocity vector (stern ahead).  We are waiting for 36 ¬∞ west longitude and begin braking.  We brake until the estimated shortfall is about 100 km. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f61/645/e15/f61645e1522346d3bcb96f64bb3fcc87.jpg"><br><br>  At an altitude of approximately 150 km, we unseal the household compartment (button <b>A</b> ) and separate the compartments with two taps <b>J</b> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c54/223/67c/c5422367cff1439fb153db7fb87abe16.jpg"><br><br>  After separation of the compartments, we select the landing site again as a target.  The lander in reality is controlled only by roll and pitch, in the simulator there is also a yaw.  We occupy the position "stern ahead" and at first do not interfere in the management - the ship in the atmosphere orients itself: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e1c/fca/b49/e1cfcab492c54e6cbd80cf6a5a9ecfb2.jpg"><br><br>  If necessary, you can perform small maneuvers roll, driving lift.  It should be noted that the space for maneuver is very limited, you can fix only small errors: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/362/2b6/552/3622b6552c944251a85352032dfdbf8c.jpg"><br><br>  Parachutes and soft-fit engines are entered automatically: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c32/d4b/6ac/c32d4b6acd8749d0abe54ea1c1642b9d.jpg"><br><br>  An error of 15 km, the maximum overload of 4.7 g - an excellent result for manual landing! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf4/ca8/ac8/bf4ca8ac8fae4bc29bb1028349a54e3c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/779/850/fd5/779850fd5b2c4406965f3cbe9e1a43b0.jpg"><br>  <i>Marcos Pontes returned to Earth on the ‚ÄúSoyuz TMA-7‚Äù, the third on the ‚ÄúSoyuz TMA-8‚Äù landed Anusha Ansari - a native of Iran, a US citizen and the fourth space tourist.</i> <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.kulch.spb.ru/Files/Orbiter2010_rus.pdf">Translated into Russian manual</a> . <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/search/%3Ftarget_type%3Dposts%26q%3D%5BOrbiter%5D%2520%26order_by%3Ddate">The entire series of publications on Orbiter</a> . <br>  For real manned launches and landings, there is almost always a broadcast <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/">on NASA TV</a> , text and video broadcasts can also be expected, for example, in <a href="http://vk.com/fka_roskosmos">the Roscosmos VK group</a> or search for links to broadcasts on the <a href="http://novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/forum/forum10/">Cosmonautics News forum</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/240103/">https://habr.com/ru/post/240103/</a></p>
