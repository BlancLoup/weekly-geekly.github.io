As is usually the case, there are opportunities and a certain resource, but there are no ideas that, in principle, devalues ‚Äã‚Äãthe cost of everything that is available, because all this is just idle. <br>  Well, I came to the conclusion that there was a desire to create something like that. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>The first idea, perhaps not a new, more or less simple CMS</b> <b><br></b>  <b>(let's call it ‚Äúconductor‚Äù):</b> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
      With all the variety of online services and various CMS, it is not always what you need to, simply, quickly and conveniently.  Here I am faced with similar.  By this, the idea came to make some simple to the obscene management system, which would be as convenient and simple as possible.  And the most important thing is that it can be quickly done and integrated. <br><br>  The point is the following, we have simple static pages that need to be edited.  Now the process is the following, we upload everything via FTP, then we edit it in our favorite editor, and then upload it back.  To create, for example, a new section, you need to create a new page and edit a huge number of old ones, with a preliminary transfer by FTP.  It is difficult and tedious, but the site is already there and it is necessary to solve the problem in some way.  Respectively‚Ä¶ <br><br>  Create a CMS based on three key points: <br>  The file system of our ‚Äúweb server‚Äù, a visual editor and a small JavaScript + PHP library. <br><br>  Working with the file system will provide us, firstly, local (on the server) file management, secondly, building the menu (using the structure and attributes of directories), thirdly, interaction (creating, deleting, moving) with the files themselves. <br><br>  Editor, as is clear, we need to work with the files themselves, which are located in directories, we also put some elements of templating into the editor, and the ability to create and edit files of various types (.html, .css, .txt, .php, .js ).  In addition, we need to integrate simple tools into this editor for working with media files. <br><br>  Finally, the JavaScript + PHP library.  In this case, JS and PHP will play the role of a controller, allowing you to edit and manage the content of the site, since the display of the resource, like any static site, comes at the expense of regular HTML. <br><br>  According to my estimates, it will take from 3 to 5 days to develop such a system, with minimal capabilities that can be improved later.  However, I would not like to reinvent the wheel.  But we will see. <br><br>  <b>The second idea, too, may not be new.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>(let's call it ‚ÄúCommunicator 2.0‚Äù):</b> <br><br>  Resource dedicated to the creation of a customized, personal information space.  Probably, I‚Äôm not the only one who have a bunch of accounts, each of which is in different social networks, services and other resources.  When an account on any site can be linked, for example, with the same Google, this is good, but unfortunately not all portals that interest me, communities and information resources have such an opportunity.  As a way out, you can of course ‚Äúbind RSS‚Äù, but this is also not very good, as it causes a huge avalanche of informational contamination over time.  And it becomes very difficult to find what interests you at the moment.  In addition, when there is a certain news that could be added to several sites.  I am not a supporter of cross-posting, but, for example, you need to place an advertisement for the sale of something, and you have to register and jump from one resource to another in order to add, and then also to see the reviews and suggestions.  In general, it would be much more convenient to collect it all in one place. <br><br>  The way out of this situation, I think would be the creation of a single resource that would allow you to easily and easily manage all your accounts, be it mail, social network or some other information resource. <br>  I thought about the implementation of such a project, came to some conclusions.  What is necessary? <br><br>  Convenient interface that would be understandable without additional documentation and training. <br>  When a user goes to the site, he should at first glance understand where everything is and what to do about it.  There should not be any "long" transitions (no more than two ideally). <br><br>  The ability to collect all your accounts in one place (later going to openID). <br>  Creating a specific master key that would protect all user accounts.  Ideally, the user should, in principle, be registered only once, and the rest should be picked up automatically when you connect this or that service, network or any other site. <br><br>  A toolkit that allows you to work with each area included in the "communicator". <br>  Naturally, if a user has several mailboxes whose data has already been entered into the ‚Äúcommunicator‚Äù, then he should simply look through his letters and reply, without any additional problems and unnecessary actions.  If the user views or adds some material, then again, he should not do any extra actions, he wrote, published wherever necessary and that's all. <br><br>  Rather simple and ‚Äúfast‚Äù design that will not load the client‚Äôs machine. <br>  In order for the user to be interested in such a resource, it is necessary that the ‚Äúengine‚Äù is fast, not loaded or ‚Äúthought‚Äù for a very long time.  Otherwise, it will be easier to navigate through the bookmarks, for all the necessary resources, the same amount of time will be spent. <br><br>  Simplicity and ease of registration and navigation through the communicator. <br>  Registration, it is necessary to simplify, to such an extent that was achieved in two or three transitions (but do not forget about security).  In addition, it is necessary to allow the user to fully control the appearance of his ‚Äúcommunicator‚Äù, so that all he needs is within one or two transitions.  These are not only good tone rules, but also an increased level of usability. <br><br>  And finally, the elements associated with the concept of 2.0.  It is necessary that this service allows all registered users to interact with each other.  Sharing what he does not mind for others, this bookmarks, and some news feeds, and various content, and all sorts of files. <br><br>  In principle, I have already begun to compile the necessary documentation and terms of reference for myself, but for the time being I find it difficult to determine the approximate dates for creating such a project. <br><br>  I would like to hear the opinion of those who may have already encountered similar ideas, or maybe just something to advise ... <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : It was clear to ask for help was stupid, well, I will consider for the future ... <br>  Apparently reprints from other news feeds, etc., are more suitable here ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46760/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46760/</a></p>
