  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How I bought a domain</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It so happened that during the registration of a couple of domains I contacted Garant-Park-Telecom.  I have an account there, and from time to time I extend the purchase in my account.  Not so long ago, as they say, I started playing with it, and I needed a domain that consonant with my last name.  And what, it's cool, to get an address like vasya@pupkin.com.  After breaking through on whois, I found out that he had an owner.  But instead of the address there was something anonymous of type <a href="http://r01.ru/kontakt_admin.html">r01.ru/kontakt_admin.html</a> .  Yeah, I thought, this is a form for an anonymous connection with an anonymous domain owner. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The answer came quickly, and not from the hypothetical Ivan Petrovich, but from the GPT.  It turned out that the domain is at auction.  Apparently, he doesn‚Äôt have a host as such, so I was invited to participate.  I have never dealt with auctions and did not know what to expect from them, so any experience would be useful. <br>  Here it is necessary to make a small lyrical digression.  The fact is that my surname is not Ivanov at all, and she is not on the list of common surnames even in a homeopathic dose.  For several years of searching (specifically looking for!), I found in the internet only one namesake, who turned out to be a football player of one regional team, although not from a seedy one. <br>  In general, it is reasonable to assume that from the footballer‚Äôs side nothing threatens me, I threw 500 rubles to my account, pressed the ‚Äúbig red button‚Äù with a price of 100 rubles (TCI = 0) and went to sleep.  It was a Saturday, the auction lasts 72 hours, because by now I saw myself as the owner of the address. <br>  Today, at one in the morning, I receive a letter in the style of ‚ÄúAha!  Your bid is slain! ‚Äù  I go and see there anonymus with a half hundred rubles.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not for nothing,‚Äù I thought.  Under world domination of bots, it is quite reasonable with a high degree of probability to assume that they are banal to me.  I waited for the last 5-minute segment, I bet 200, but immediately after updating the page I saw a 250 bet. I still decided that I was not going to spend more than 500 rubles, so I made several bets at the last minute, bringing the price to 500 rubles, each interim rate instantly interrupted.  And when I saw my final number, which was not interrupted by a mysterious competitor who SOZHDELEL of my domain, I was finally convinced that I paid for the course ‚ÄúHow to dissolve a sucker for 500 rubles‚Äù worth 500 rubles. <br>  Summarizing this lengthy story, I want to briefly express the main thoughts: <br><ol><li>  It was a bot produced by Garant-Park-Telecom. </li><li>  I think if I had 3000 rubles on my account, the bot would have brought up to 3000, and then I would have merged it.  AND... </li><li>  ... if the account was 200 rubles, the domain would cost me 200 rubles </li><li>  If the bot did not merge, I would receive a letter like "the winner refused to buy, and your bet won" </li><li>  Domain auctions are an almost legal way for registrars to <b>extort</b> money for domains that they don‚Äôt own. </li><li>  It's good that my name is not Ivanov </li></ol><br>  Why did I describe these events here?  Because googling on the topic ‚Äúauctions scam bots buy cheap‚Äù almost did not bring.  I hope my impressions will add a couple of kilobytes to the restless air of unconscious knowledge, and people will become a little smarter.  Amen. </div>
