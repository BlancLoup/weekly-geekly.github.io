  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Black developers: dismissed programmers return ... with devilish code</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Programmers are fired for various reasons, sometimes very strange. <br>  But with regard to developers, something else is important: they can pay their former employer very seriously, which is hardly available to most other professions.  There are a lot of stories about how developers spread viruses, destroyed data, stole secrets and made various electronic disorders right after being shown to the door. <br><br>  Let's walk along the avenue of glory of bright developers (or just computers with good abilities) who have gone over to the dark side of power. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Rajendrasinh Babubhai Makwana </h2><br>  The guy was a unix engineer who was fired from loan giant Fannie Mae for writing a bad script.  In retaliation, he <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/158593/fannie_mae_engineer_indicted.html">laid a "logical bomb</a> . <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/158593/fannie_mae_engineer_indicted.html">"</a>  It is worth noting that he was fired because ‚Äúhe mistakenly wrote a script that makes changes to the settings of the Unix system, without obtaining proper permission from his management‚Äù (FBI report). <br><br>  After working for two years, Makvana, before his dismissal, created another script <a href="http://www.sify.com/news/indian-american-convicted-for-infecting-fannie-mae-computers-news-international-kkhaOqjjecd.html">that</a> ‚Äúwas designed to spread Fannie Mae across the network and destroy all data, including financial, commercial and credit information.‚Äù

      Another engineer discovered a suspicious script before it could cause any harm.  However, McWann was <a href="http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2010/12/18/5202959.htm">found, detained and sentenced</a> to "three years and five months for hacking computers." <br><br>  Abaldet, forty-one months in prison only for trying to sabotage.  How much would he have been given if his vile plan had been a success. <br><br><h2>  Tim Lloyd (Tim Lloyd) </h2><br>  The network administrator, who <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2002/0304lloyd.html">worked for a long time at Omega Engineering, ‚Äúdestroyed the corporate network‚Äù</a> after he was fired ‚Äúdue to problems with performance and discipline‚Äù. <br><br>  Lloyd <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2000-06-27/tech/omega.files.idg_1_server-manufacturing-capabilities-manufacturing-programs%3F_s%3DPM:TECH">acted as a detective hero</a> , but ultimately, after a long investigation by the Secret Service and his associates, he was caught and sentenced to 41 months in prison (apparently, this period became standard according to the precedent with McVanna). <br><br><h2>  Donald Gene Burleson </h2><br>  The grandfather of all the vile programmers who do not want to go nowhere quietly.  If you believe the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/21/business/programmer-convicted-after-planting-a-virus.html">New York Times article for 1988</a> , provided with useful information about what a computer virus is, then this 39-year-old programmer was "the first person convicted of spreading a computer virus." <br><br>  Burleson was solicited seven years on probation and $ 12,000 in damages for the destruction of ‚Äúmore than 168,000 records of employee benefit payments‚Äù by the USPA &amp; IRA Co technical security company two days after his dismissal. <br><br><h2>  Claudius R. Carpenter II (Claude R. Carpenter II) </h2><br>  This is a twenty-year-old employee of the IRS, <a href="http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2001-10-30/news/0110300187_1_carpenter-computer-access-sabotage">who</a> ‚Äúhad to be dismissed due to repeated reprimands due to being late,‚Äù found a letter about his dismissal in a computer boss.  Without waiting for the ax to descend, he "introduced destructive code on three network servers, which destroyed many files." <br><br>  In addition, he also set up the boss‚Äôs computer so that his material will be available on the next logon. <br><br>  However, if you are a professional programmer, it doesn‚Äôt mean that you can do other things professionally too - for example, cover up traces - Carpenter "periodically called the system administrator for the next two weeks to ask if everything was alright with the servers." <br><br>  Such a brilliant move resulted in 15 months of imprisonment and $ 108,000 in payments. <br><br><h2>  Roger Duronio </h2><br>  Very nervous fellow, he was not even fired.  He was upset by his ‚Äúscanty‚Äù annual bonus of some $ 32,000.  Therefore, this 63-year-old programmer quit his job with a salary of $ 125,000 a year (it is worth noting that in 2002 it was better than working now) and <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/disgruntled-worker-tried-to-cripple-ubs-in-protest-over-32000-bonus-481515.html">laid a ‚Äúlogical bomb‚Äù</a> that destroyed 2,000 (according to some 1,000) computers of his employer BS Paine Webber.  The company estimated the damage at around $ 3 million. <br><br>  Meanwhile, Duronye went to his broker with $ 23,000 to play on a sharp drop in his employer's stock after his creation worked and the network was destroyed.  But, as was recorded in the testimony, "the exchange did not react to the operation of the logic bomb, and Duronet lost $ 23,000." <br><br>  In return, he received 97 months in federal prison. <br><br><hr><br>  Posted by David Ramel, <a href="http://adtmag.com/Articles/2011/03/28/Fired-Programmers-Strike-Back.aspx">original in English</a> . <br>  Translated <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/unconnected/" class="user_link">unconnected</a> in the name of the bright side of power. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117239/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117239/</a></p>
