  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Warm up for the mind. Rate the creativity of your thinking!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I drove to the Svetoch bookshop in Minsk in search of the book ‚ÄúBusiness that Survives, or the Fool Factor.  How to avoid common mistakes that can kill a case. ‚ÄùPeter Jamp.  But as usual in recent times, the book was not there.  And now I wander around the room, trying to intuitively find something that will give me new thoughts and food for thought.  I took one book in my hand, another one, I looked through it, I read it - not that.  And here in the corner I was attracted to the book in the light green cover.  I open it.  Bam!  There is something in it.  I try to trust the inner feeling, read a few pages and realized that I must buy it.  The price is ridiculous - about 10 dollars for 350 pages in hardcover.  She, as it turned out, has been lying there since 2007, and therefore it is discounted. <br><br>  I really liked the book.  I still read it.  She is so full of energy that it is impossible to swallow it in one breath.  Inside, as if something is transformed gradually, so reading is obtained in portions. <br><br>  I want to share with you some interesting puzzles that this creation abounds in.  They are creative and ingenious.  On non-template and ability to find non-standard solutions. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>1. The eighteenth horse.</b> <br>  One old man, dying, left 17 horses to his three sons.  He bequeathed half the horses to the eldest son, a third to the middle one, and one ninth to the youngest.  The sons tried to divide the father's inheritance, but could not, because 17 is not divided neither by 2, nor by 3, nor by 9. None of the brothers wanted to give in, in the end, after heated debates, they turned to the sage. <br>  ‚ÄúTake my horse and your problem will be solved,‚Äù the sage told them. <br>  The sons were ashamed of the old man‚Äôs words, but they accepted his gift.  Now they have 18 horses. <br><br>  Finish this parable yourself.  I'll post it later. <br><br>  <b>2. What letter in this diagram seems superfluous?</b> <br> <a href="http://www.save-img.com/v.php%3Fid%3Dbae049d8856ab6058dab2497aafce238"><img src="http://www.save-img.com/pic_s/bae049d8856ab6058dab2497aafce238.jpg"></a> <br>  <b>3. The story about the father and son.</b> <br>  This task is unpleasant in essence, but try to focus not on the content, but on the solution. <br>  So, father and son were driving along the highway and got into a terrible accident.  The father died on the spot, and the son suffered serious injuries.  Son brought to the hospital and prepared for emergency surgery.  A surgeon enters, sees the patient and suddenly exclaims: ‚ÄúI cannot oppose him!  This is my son!" <br>  Is it possible, and if so, how can this be explained?  <u>It must be remembered that surgeons never operate on close relatives for moral and psychological reasons.</u> <br>  <b>4. Equation.</b> <br>  This Roman numeral equation is incorrect.  Correct it without interchanging these figures, and also without adding or subtracting any other numbers. <br> <a href="http://www.save-img.com/v.php%3Fid%3D7511705e783cf919e770bed74a33f47e"><img src="http://www.save-img.com/pic_s/7511705e783cf919e770bed74a33f47e.jpg"></a> <br>  <b>5. Letters.</b> <br>  The letters A, D, M, P are inside the drawn circle, and the letters B, B, C, and P are outside.  Where should be the letter E, outside or inside?  Where should the letters Z, I, N, O and all the rest be? <br><br>  Answers to the tasks will be a little later.  Warm up, friends, this is useful! <br><br>  Good luck! <br><br>  Shl.  The book is called ‚ÄúBusiness + Creative‚Äù by Arthur Gogatz and Ruben Mondekhar </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/68967/">https://habr.com/ru/post/68967/</a></p>
