Physically, these phones have not reached us yet, but the previous three models: 305, 306 and 311 have already been sold in Russia since the end of August.  So I had the opportunity to get acquainted with this line, interesting not only the price category, to which its products belong, but also the Series 40 software platform, which was pretty much reworked for touch control, on which the devices of this line work. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/82d/665/ed8/82d665ed8bba6ebd1fb3a49ee75fc7ff.jpg" alt="image">

    <h4>  Story </h4><br>  S40, - one of the earliest developments of Nokia.  The first Nokia 7110 phone that worked on the S40 was introduced in 1999.  It was the device, the direct predecessor of which was the legendary Nokia 8110, which became a cult thanks to the film The Matrix.  And so, in the same year, when the Matrix triumphantly walked across the screens of the whole world, and the Nokia 8110 was as significant a product as the iPhone was (and maybe still is) a couple of years ago, Nokia introduced the model 7110, the first phone on the new Series 40 platform. Although, now Nokia itself prefers to lead the s40 story from the 7110 follower - the 7210 model, which already has support for a color screen. <br><br>  From a stylistic point of view, the 7110 did not repeat the success of the Matrix Phone, in part because it simply could not be repeated.  However, from a technological point of view, the Nokia 7110 was without exaggeration a revolutionary device, because it became the first Nokia phone to support WAP technology, which opened access from the phone to the Internet. <br><br>  Over the past 13 years, 6 full-fledged editions of the S40 software platform have been released.  Some of these editions (such as, for example, the 3-rd edition, which appeared in 2005) had several sub-versions that introduced one or another functionality to the new devices.  In total, more than 200 phone models were produced on the S40, and the total circulation of devices sold on the S40 exceeded 1.5 billion copies.  For comparison, Android devices sold about 500 million in total, and 400 million on iOS. Of course, they are noticeably younger than the S40, but still. <br><br>  However, throughout its history, the S40 remained a platform only for keyboard devices.  And so, at the end of last year, Nokia introduced the ‚Äútouch‚Äù version of the S40, which inherited much from the interface, as it turned out during the presentation, from the MeeGo Harmattan operating system, which runs the Nokia N9 smartphone.  Actually, that's why I was interested in these budget models, and when they finally became available for the test, I asked to test them. <br><br><h4>  First look </h4><br>  All devices of this line are positioned as very simple, I would even say the most minimalist phones with touch controls.  The target audience is designated as youth.  Personally, I would argue with that.  For teenagers from not well-to-do families, for an eight-year-old boy to buy an iPhone, yes.  But for the 18-year-old boy, in my opinion, no longer.  On the other hand, in my opinion, these phones are very good just for the older generation.  In any case, this is so to say "entry-level sensor sensors."  The devices are aimed primarily at the markets of developing countries, India, for example, where, by the way, phones are manufactured. <br><br>  Anyway, these are small devices with 3-inch displays, and, in the case of the older, 311 model, a capacitive display is used, in other models, a resistive display.  As a protective coating is not used Gorilla Glsas, but some very good protective plastic.  Personally, I liked the 305 and 306 models much more for the design and materials used for the case, and 311, the older model, for the hardware.  305 and 306, for my taste, very weak and s40 on them, either because of the iron, or because of the resistive displays, will not scroll so smoothly. <br><br>  Generally, if, looking ahead, to immediately write about your findings, then I liked the line, especially liked the tach version of the S40.  The only thing that distinguishes these phones from smartphones is the lack of multitasking in the S40.  But on the other hand, it is known that the same Android, and iOS in the overwhelming majority of cases, when the application is minimized, freezes the processes, so that in the background the application hangs more formally, so to speak, rather than functionally.  In this sense, the S40 acts as if it is more honest, closing applications, and not minimizing them.  Of course, there are exceptions: of course, you can simultaneously listen to music and browse on the Internet, or read a book.  Minimally necessary multitasking is still present.  Otherwise, if we talk about the interface, then it is absolutely smartphone here.  Of course, in MeeGo Harmattan everything is more elegant, but on the other hand, svayp-elements in s40 also look very nice. <br><br>  Well, now I propose to consider the phones themselves.  And start with the older, 311 models. <br><br><h4>  Nokia Asha Touch 311 </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4fe/a80/9b5/4fea809b51ac30fb544e2c25ce1ca97e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Despite the interface interface controls that the S40 inherited from MeeGo Harmattan, the Asha Touch phones are not without hardware buttons.  There are two of them, the most simple: the receive and end button.  The end call button, while held, also performs the function of turning the phone on and off.  Strangely, the receive button does not activate the dialer interface for any other active application.  Perhaps this is done so that involuntarily active programs do not close?  But, on the other hand, it could be implemented also, with a warning, as applications close when you press the end button.  The lock and unlock button of the display is located on the right side, there is also a volume rocker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f71/816/89e/f7181689eacbdd2ef119f72ac862777d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/814/a02/f02/814a02f02406383fd52c8b44c59a8e18.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f28/c52/76f/f28c5276f6ec3e8c756e38f9df5bb110.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/83d/3fd/4f5/83d3fd4f5e4b246e024eb8b9b9ee0ed6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the top there is a 2 mm jack for charging, a micro-USB jack for connecting to a computer.  However, through it the phone can be charged, both from the computer and from the network.  Well, there, at the top, there is a 3.5 mm headphone jack.  On the left side there is only a small hole for the strap.  Case 311 model is made of plastic.  The back cover is glossy and rounded, which I personally did not really like. <br><br>  The diagonal of the display in all three models is 3 inches, with a resolution of 240x400 pixels.  The display recognizes 65 thousand colors.  Multitouch is present only in the Gallery.  The browser window is scaled by double tap. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/229/5a0/8cd/2295a08cd4c0afd554f6ff56aa65aa52.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Nokia Browser, is one of the main tactile S40 chips.  It compresses up to 90% of traffic, thereby saving the user's money.  At the same time, I will not say that the browser is very fast.  With a Wi-Fi connection, it works quite tolerantly, but with 3G it is very slow.  However, using this browser is quite realistic.  There are also additional browsers in the App Store, although of those that I tried, Nokia Browser still seemed to be the best. <br><br>  The hardware of the 311 models is not as weak as it may seem.  It is based on 1 GHz processor, the amount of RAM is 256 MB, which is enough for S40.  The amount of internal memory is 128 MB, and the microSD slot supports cards up to 32 GB.  Included with the model line is attached microSD-card 2 GB. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b2/ea6/259/2b2ea6259942155efd878fd239fd2e35.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/530/0cf/896/5300cf89671655d86d4c15712755536e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Above the display are light and proximity sensors, just like adults.  But the front camera in the 311, as well as in the 305 and 306 models - no.  The main camera in the 311 model 3.2 MP.  Available as a widescreen photo and video shooting, and with a 4: 3 aspect ratio.  Here are more detailed characteristics of photos and video files created by the camera Nokia Asha 311. <br><br>  A photo: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/24f/0ff/319/24f0ff319d517d4bf8e82d74acc93dff.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Video: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dec/857/f00/dec857f00f8c38c8761819f1cbb34492.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here are some photos and video examples: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a05/e50/a4f/a05e50a4fb1a74b06d54ad01c28cf323.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e43/28f/c83/e4328fc8370e8f8fd89ee5a281b18c3f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dd2/48e/ade/dd248eade32024cce8a2fe9f59253387.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f7f/720/20d/f7f72020def76c94d7e84282af78fef0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/J0N-ZPElQGQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiKZVbR4OEod4N--tjnuCAchcQarQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/D1mAq5lbxQ0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiuB7CVmLAVrokCXWSUWZ_ZMeQhew" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/DJ1E0F1yTpk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhi72ECDGaWUn0L2t1TAe7TZ007qew" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The phone is equipped with a 1100 mAh battery, which with a very modest S40 in appetites without problems lasts 2-3 days.  In general, the older, 311 model of the new Nokia Asha Touch lineup, I quite liked.  Not a smartphone yet, but obviously not just a phone.  A more detailed overview of this model can be viewed in two parts of this video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/AzzYgaWkXoU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiOZsTQ3wRTPBVOs_91V0TzNAfvgw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/eHPis1qIQbI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhg7mmGRhR7I3sQ8HafKUkPVY9HYbA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  <b>Nokia Asha Touch 305 and 306</b> </h4><br>  These two models are strikingly different from the older ones in form and in terms of materials used.  There is already no glossy plastic, only matte polycarbonate.  Yes, and two hardware buttons do not stick out above the body and go with it flush. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/438/a6a/80a/438a6a80ab7a340dca8d3d5fc7971daa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/125/ca1/84f/125ca184f41c0558e21f358d87fda394.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d4/f34/1d9/0d4f341d9d0abdbadf8c826155b0c875.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/219/4c8/2ee/2194c82ee2dc08b025052f195352c79b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The fundamental difference between these two models is the same: the 305 model does not have a Wi-Fi module, but has support for two SIM cards, and the 306 model has one slot for a SIM card, but is equipped with a Wi-Fi module. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/81e/539/3a5/81e5393a522eb22ba5c8be4515cf03e4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/31a/ab5/b9a/31aab5b9a0b406e890601b3d9ab9aae9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ff/eb3/370/3ffeb337059cd519274440ac35239455.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b3e/b64/ce7/b3eb64ce724bacac314d42e037757f1c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In principle, the logic of manufacturers is clear: there are regions where Wi-Fi is not available, but with 3G, more or less order.  For this, basically, there is, I think, a second slot for a SIM card.  However, I‚Äôll make a reservation that I personally don‚Äôt understand anything about phones with two SIM cards.  I, as a user, have another problem: how to use one and the same SIM card in all cases, moreover, so that it already stands in a particular device, and not to rearrange it from one to another.  So I will not dwell on the model 305 dvuhsimochnoy, and consider both of these models, as essentially one, because the other characteristics are really identical. <br><br>  They differ from 311 models by the main camera.  Here she is 2 Mp at all.  Photographs while she posting to the Internet is more or less acceptable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5a9/fbd/587/5a9fbd587907651824a17303e78c6ed8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/044/b9d/b47/044b9db47667e9efda631ab81c0d6d4e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13f/13d/f34/13f13df34c86ebe4ac6f30a2e6fdbf82.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6a6/5fd/82c/6a65fd82cbbcce3373ae173cae6d2966.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/940/1c1/ea2/9401c1ea28f20837af29807765d36b5d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But the video shoots frankly weak.  Or is it just that we have already lost the habit of such a video image?  But even if this is the case, then thank God that they have lost the habit.  To look at this picture is really hard. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/CFoVObBsQS8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgbbI1aJoqMacKFGSsx_GIdXqCBQA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y-7YenXC6_A%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgkNvCKvYTKhcKGIfx6H50O6cT4mQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Moreover, in the case of photos and in the case of video, in these models there is no widescreen shooting mode.  The truth is that the length of the video, as in the 311 models, is limited only by the amount of free space on the miroSD card. <br><br>  I never managed to find out which processor is installed in these two younger models.  It is possible that the same as in the 311 models, and the difference in speed and responsiveness is due to the resistive display and the smaller amount of internal memory.  There are 10 MB in these models, which, of course, is very small. <br><br>  A more detailed overview of the Nokia Asha Touch 305 and 306 models can be viewed in this video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/VEfU411uHoA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhi7DEA0NCRH34NbksCp9AT5KlaCCQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  <b>Thoughts after the test</b> </h4><br>  I understand that I did not have a complete test at all, but what has grown has grown, as they say.  Thinking about this new Nokia line after the test, I came to the following conclusions. <br><br>  First, I really liked the tactile version of the S40.  The interface is really comfortable and elegant.  Despite the small diagonal of the display, the keyboard in both the vertical and horizontal layout is very convenient.  And in general, I think the return of the S40 in the tachev version took place and promises a full new life. <br><br>  You can see the S40 interface and functionality in detail in 4 parts of this video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/j_UUUXC9dDo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjICPHrWgKJ3DQl4lFr3G1ybyWIDw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/MkfImI8doR8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjYWrlIxZDQRqqeiWNlS0WdJyyJWg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/rkNw6GjRvCw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgoX9HWomBLABU_bJ2ZmXQOSWwfng" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/iMvY2RuxLJY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjYfnHSaMPWfgKGR3EeHP0YA6lQfQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Another thing is the devices themselves.  Hand on heart, - I did not like any of the phones at 100%.  The older, 311 model, in my opinion, is quite suitable for use and can even compete with cheap Chinese smartphones on Android.  But for younger models I would definitely prefer Nokia Asha keyboards. <br><br>  If I was asked, I would try to release a more powerful model based on the S40, with a display with an adequate diagonal and resolution, with a 5 megapixel camera and with an appearance that looks more like 305 and 306 models, rather than 311. Although also how to say, because the taste and color of comrades is not, as is known.  However, I am sure that these models will find their customers.  On my own behalf, I would recommend still paying attention to the 311 model, which, in my opinion, is absolutely self-sufficient. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/376/910/b12/376910b120883dd0f1be7117ca0c93ce.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/154515/">https://habr.com/ru/post/154515/</a></p>
