Depending on the needs of Central Asia, its desires and values, you can develop texts or promotional offers that will attract the attention of subscribers.  The most important thing is that only an analysis of the audience will help find the answer, why customers should prefer your company.  But, a full analysis of the audience does well if every third.  Especially when it comes to mailing lists. <br>  Email marketing is communication.  It is hardly possible to communicate with a person productively, absolutely not knowing him.  To understand the specifics of the audience, one should take into account demography, geography, psychography and the behavior of subscribers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <b>Demography</b> </h4><br><ul><li>  Floor </li><li>  Age </li><li>  Ethnic </li><li>  Family status </li><li>  Income </li></ul><br>  Here are the main questions that you should answer in the process of analyzing the audience of existing subscribers and potential customers.  In the process of analysis, of course, you can try to build on your own conjectures and assumptions.  But will they be true? <br>  <b>There are two ways out:</b> <br><ul><li>  Survey of subscribers and the right audience: will give accurate results, but it will be quite difficult in the organization and search of respondents.  As a last resort, you can create a survey form in Google Forms and survey random network users by posting a survey on your blog or on social networks. </li><li>  Collection of statistics from city portals, like <a href="http://www.gks.ru/">http://www.gks.ru/</a> for Russia or <a href="http://www.belstat.gov.by/">http://www.belstat.gov.by/</a> for the Republic of Belarus.  Here you can get data on the registered income level of citizens of one or another age / gender / place of residence and get a clearer picture of the life of your audience. </li></ul><br><h4>  <b>Geography</b> </h4><br>  An important criterion when it comes to mailing lists for online stores.  Two issues run into the geography of subscribers ‚Äôsubsistence: ensuring the logistics of delivery and the relevance of product offers for the region. <br>  In any case, it will not be difficult to answer the questions of the country and region of your potential customers even without using surveys or data analysis centers. <br><br>  If you work internationally or in a multicultural country, we advise you to take into account in the newsletters and the nationality of subscribers.  This will give an opportunity to hold additional shares on national holidays.

    <h4>  <b>Psychography</b> </h4><br>  Marketers have always divided people into generations, eroding the target audience to tens of millions of people around the world.  Yes, and the year of birth is unlikely to tell when a random user of the network will be ready to subscribe to your newsletter or buy goods. <br><br>  However, just a couple of years ago, the whole world was trumpeting about targeting marketing efforts of brands to millennials, and now we see a turn in the direction of the Z generation. <br><br>  <b>Modern consumers are much less similar to each other</b> than the baby boomer generation, for example.  Social networks gave them the opportunity to create themselves as a unique brand.  And, in order to more effectively influence the audience, marketers need to unravel the formulas of these people-brands.  Here psychography comes to the rescue. <br><br>  Psychographic data is a real well of information for a marketer.  While geographic and demographic criteria make it possible to combine subscribers into groups, <b>psychography helps to find an approach to them as individuals.</b> <br><br>  Psychography considers the consumer in terms of his life cycle.  The first to introduce psychographic algorithms in its marketing strategy was Amazon with its purchase recommendations and ‚Äúother users bought ...‚Äù with this product. <br><br>  For example, let's take an analysis on the demographic and psychographic criteria of the same consumer, to whom we are going to promote sports goods: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9cf/2c3/ba5/9cf2c3ba58ec4511b0b4ac2d42547d17.jpg"><br><br>  Agree, from the second column, the marketer will be able to draw out more information for interaction.  The question remains, where does such data come from? <br><br><h5>  Profiles in social networks </h5><br>  Pages on social networks - the source of the most accurate information about the life of the target audience.  Users themselves talk about their lives, events, people they communicate with ... And this information is publicly available both for other users of social networks and for companies. <br>  In addition, social network profiles are now often integrated with mobile applications, and this is also additional information about a potential client. <br><br>  What was previously impossible to find out is now available to marketers at any time: <br><ul><li>  Where did the subscriber go on the weekend? </li><li>  What gym is he doing? </li><li>  What is going to buy? </li><li>  What is experiencing, etc. </li></ul><br>  GraphEffect, for example, has long been using Facebook status change analysis to get the most up-to-date subscriber information and extend client communication with the brand. <br><br><h5>  Life Cycle Stages </h5><br>  Viewing all the same profiles in social networks helps to understand what stage of life the subscriber is at.  If the subscriber has children, then we can assume that they will be sent to kindergarten / school.  Accordingly, you can find suitable offers for such a case.  A potential client enters the university - the same thing + add activity (contests, party announcements) - students love to have fun. <br>  Understanding the life cycle, values, views on life and activity of subscribers will provide an opportunity to establish normal communication and productive cooperation. <br><br><h4>  <b>Subscribers behavior in the network</b> </h4><br><ul><li>  What are looking for? </li><li>  Where to go from mailing? </li><li>  What are interested in? </li></ul><br>  Answers to these questions provide not only additional opportunities for retargeting, but also help to understand what to offer to the subscriber in the newsletter right now. <br>  Any user of the network is always looking for benefits for themselves.  If you can give him this benefit, you will win the client. <br><br>  Analyze your subscribers, learn to see in them not a source of income, but personalities.  This is the only way to achieve good results and long, fruitful cooperation. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca2/9ba/b7f/ca29bab7f3794b228bb1e1dfecf86916.jpg">  Irina Chugay, marketer <a href="https://sendpulse.com/">SendPulse</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294768/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294768/</a></p>
