    <h2>  <strong>Email for sales</strong> </h2><br>  E-mails are used by everyone, but often they are made ‚Äúso-so‚Äù, and in this case everything should be brought to the ideal.  Users receive 50-100 mediocre emails each day.  In order for your letter to be opened, read and bought, all you need to do is not to get on the ‚Äúso-so letters‚Äù list. <br><br>  The following 8 facts confirm the importance of proper email marketing. <br><br>  <b>1. Email is 40 times more effective in generating new leads than Facebook and Twitter combined.</b>  <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/marketing_sales/why_marketers_should_keep_sending_you_emails"><b>Mckinsey</b></a> <br>  Email is the perfect intermediary between you and the client, but it takes time.  Try using smart segmentation and personalization, as we do in the <strong><a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontet%26utm_content%3D29factov%26utm_campaign%3Dsale">Carrot Quest</a></strong> .  This will help to divide users into groups and send them a personal offer. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/06d/000/497/06d0004975ade6f835d744feffc3011e.png" alt="2015-12-22 12-44-35 Why marketers should not keep sending you McKinsey &amp; Company e-mails - Google Chrome" width="512" height="381"></a> <br><br>  <b>2. Email marketing has twice the ROI than cold calls.</b>  <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/JakeAtwood1/20-shocking-sales-stats"><b>MarketingSherpa</b></a> <br>  Mail is 2 times more powerful in this regard than cold calls.  Squeeze out of it all that is possible.  <strong><a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontet%26utm_content%3D29factov%26utm_campaign%3Dsale">Carrot Quest</a></strong> will help you: see detailed statistics on how each user opens and reads your newsletters, and most importantly, keep track of how the newsletter affected sales. <br><br>  <b>3. 35% of letters open only because they have a great topic.</b>  <a href="http://www.convinceandconvert.com/convince-convert/15-email-statistics-that-are-shaping-the-future/"><b>Convince and convert</b></a> <br>  Meet on clothes, this is true for email-mailing.  Immediately tell the potential client that you have something extremely valuable for him. <br><br>  <b>4. 43% of users send a letter to spam, just looking at the email sender.</b>  <a href="http://www.convinceandconvert.com/convince-convert/15-email-statistics-that-are-shaping-the-future/"><b>Convince and convert</b></a> <br>  Send email from a normal, trusted email address. <br><br>  <b>5. Conversion of a letter is 2 times higher if there is no unnecessary clearance.</b>  <b><strong><a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontet%26utm_content%3D29factov%26utm_campaign%3Dsale">Carrot quest</a></strong></b> <br>  Users perceive a letter better if it looks like a letter from a familiar person.  Without unnecessary design, some complex patterns and pictures.  This primarily affects the user's emotions when reading a letter.  Users do not really trust beautiful template letters. <br><br>  <b>6. If the subject of the letter has the name of the addressee, then this increases the chances of opening by 2.6%.</b>  <a href="http://www.retentionscience.com/new-research-reveals-which-email-subject-lines-perform-best-for-marketers/"><b>Retention science</b></a> <b>&nbsp;</b><br>  2.6% is a very small difference.  The thing is that personalization is already more than a call to the user by name.

The use of such words as ‚Äúfind out‚Äù and ‚Äúbook‚Äù in the subject line of the letter reduces the chances that the client will open the letter.</b>  <a href="http://www.adestra.com/keywords-for-killer-subject-lines/"><b>Adestra</b></a> <br>  It sounds strange, but: not all B2B customers want to see serious things, they get tired of them.  Give them something fresh and interesting. <br><br>  <b>8. It is best to engage in mailing from 8.00 to 15.00</b> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/JakeAtwood1/20-shocking-sales-stats"><b>GetResponse</b></a> <b>&nbsp;</b><br><br>  We have the best time from 9 to 11 (Tuesday and Thursday).

It works now, though not everywhere and not always, especially in cold sales.  It is difficult to simply take and attract the attention of a stranger. <br><br>  Here are a couple of facts on optimizing phone sales. <br><br>  <b>10. 75% of surveyed clients are ready to make an appointment or attend an event after a call or letter.</b>  <a href="https://discoverorg.com/blog/need-good-leads-its-all-about-outbound/"><b>DiscoveryOrg</b></a> <br>  Make your potential customer an offer that he cannot refuse. <br><br>  The most important thing is that before the call itself you must understand the motives and interests of the user, and to do this, keep track of information about him (where he came from, what was interested in the site, what he asked for support, etc.).  On this knowledge and builds all the work in the <strong><a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontet%26utm_content%3D29factov%26utm_campaign%3Dsale">Carrot Quest</a></strong> . <br><br>  <b>11. 85% of people are dissatisfied with previous experience of receiving a cold call.</b>  <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2015/04/sales-hierarchy-lead-data-needs-gp.html"><b>Salesforce</b></a> <br>  You can not rely on Russian, perhaps when talking with a client.  Get ready for a conversation, prepare your place and information about the client and the service being sold.  Make it easy for you to talk and make it enjoyable for the client. <br><br>  <b>12. On average, salespeople make 52 calls a day.</b>  <a href="http://blog.bridgegroupinc.com/hubfs/resources/Periodic_Table_Inside_Sales.pdf%3Ft%3D1447641684020"><b>The bridge group</b></a> <br>  If you make 52 calls, then everyone should be damn efficient.  Squeeze the maximum out of your calls. <br><br>  <b>13. If you contact a lead within 5 minutes after filling out an online application, then the chances that he will pick up the phone will increase hundreds of times.</b>  <a href="http://www.insidesales.com/insider/uncategorized/why-timing-is-everything-when-responding-to-web-leads/"><b>InsideSales</b></a> <br>  For example, when users register with Carrot Quest, managers receive a notification, after which they can associate with them.  It is better to call immediately while the user‚Äôs head is busy with your product. <br><br>  <b>14. 42% of sales managers think that they do not have enough information about the client before making a call.</b>  <a href="http://lattice-engines.com/about/news/new-survey-reveals-how-big-data-solves-the-lead-generation-battle-between-sales-and-marketing"><b>Lattice engine</b></a> <b>&nbsp;</b><br>  That's right, most managers make calls, again, relying on Russian perhaps.  So it does not work. <br><br>  Clients also value their time and will not allow you to just encroach on it.  Your proposal should be as relevant as possible.  Agree, if you know the key information about the user, then bring it to the purchase will not be a problem. <br><br>  Here is how this information looks in each user's Carrot Quest card: <br><br><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/cb7/599/301/cb7599301b3fc6bd9b3ae65a7558dea3.jpg" alt="image01" width="900" height="836"></a> <br><br><br><h2>  <strong>Bringing the deal to the end</strong> </h2><br>  A lot of sales managers poorly kill customers in terms of transactions.  Many simply do not want to cause irritation, so they are cautious.  But you will have to develop your closing strategy. <br><br>  Memorize all these facts and create your own ‚Äúfatalities‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>15. 92% of sales managers surrender after a ‚Äúno‚Äù from a client, but 80% of potential customers, after 4 failures, agree for the 5th time.</b>  <a href="http://www.marketingdonut.co.uk/marketing/sales/sales-techniques-and-negotiations/why-8-of-sales-people-get-80-of-the-sales"><b>Marketing donut</b></a> <b>&nbsp;</b><br>  In fact, you handle the user's objections with each conversation.  Think about the client, what he needs and what benefits you give him.  If supply and demand are the same, then you are on the right track. <br><br>  <b>16. 80% of buyers need ‚Äúfinishing calls‚Äù and letters.</b>  <a href="https://scripted.com/cpt_experts/5-sales-statistics-to-motive-you-to-make-calls/"><b>Scripted</b></a> <br>  Remind yourself when it‚Äôs time to pay for a customer. <br><br>  <b>17. On average, you need to make about 8 repeated calls to turn the lead into a customer.</b>  <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/JakeAtwood1/20-shocking-sales-stats"><b>Telenet and Ovation Sales Group</b></a> <br>  The statement is true only if you do not know the user in advance and each call turns into a ‚Äúreconnaissance operation‚Äù.  To reduce the number of calls from 8 to 2-3, collect information about your users with the help of <strong><a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmeam%26utm_medium%3Dcontet%26utm_content%3D29factov%26utm_campaign%3Dsale">Carrot Quest</a></strong> , this will help you to make reliable offers. <br><br><br><h2>  <strong>Increase productivity</strong> </h2><br>  Maybe it is worth reviewing the process of your work with leads and clients? <br><br>  <b>18. Low productivity and poor quality of work with leads bring companies losses in the billions of dollars.</b>  <a href="http://www.cmocouncil.org/current_program_details.php%3Fpid%3D129"><b>CMO Council</b></a> <b>&nbsp;</b><br>  Productivity is important.  Work with Lida should be almost key.  The main mistake is when one user interaction scenario is used on all potential customers.  Users differ much more than you think.  Here's the article in the topic: <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/blog/kak-ispolzovat-informaciyu-o-klientax-v-avtomatizirovannom-marketinge/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontet%26utm_content%3D29factov%26utm_campaign%3Dsale"><strong>Collecting data about each user, smart segmentation and targeting - combo marketer for 2016</strong> .</a> <br><br>  <b>19. 68% of companies are fighting for high lead generation.</b>  <a href="http://salesstaff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Sales-and-Marketing-Stats-That-Will-Blow-Your-Mind.pdf"><b>SalesStaff</b></a> <b>&nbsp;</b><br>  The problem is that all the services for working with leads work separately.  Some collect data about visitors to the site, others collect the base of leads and the history of their contact with managers, in the third it is necessary to unload the base to make a newsletter, etc.  All these tools do not work as a team, so the effectiveness of their work is blurred. <br><br>  In Carrot Quest, we combined all the key tools for marketers and sales managers (collecting information about users, lead generation, email marketing, pop-ups, online chat and detailed analytics). <br><br>  <b>20. Large and successful companies more often automate the sales process.</b>  <a href="http://velocify.com/blog/4-characteristics-of-a-high-performing-sales-team/"><b>Velocify</b></a> <b>&nbsp;</b><br>  If you know what each user did on your site, you can configure all kinds of automatic actions (calls, mailings, pop-ups, etc.).  Catch users at certain stages and bring to the purchase. <br><br>  <b>21. 50% of the time is wasted on unpromising customers.</b>  <a href="http://typeacommunications.com/50-statistics-b2b-sales-marketing-misalignment/"><b>The B2B Lead</b></a> <br>  It is necessary to concentrate on a certain segment, there is no point in wasting all your efforts. <br><br>  <b>22. Only 33% of the manager‚Äôs time is spent on active sales.</b>  <a href="http://www.heinzmarketing.com/2015/02/15-inside-sales-statistics-last-weeks-aa-isp-front-lines-conference/"><b>CSO Insights</b></a> <br>  Use your time and your leads wisely.  A great CRM will allow you to track and record everything, all in one interface.  Do not waste your time on different nonsense, but communicate and sell. <br><br>  <b>23. Only 60% of managers fulfill the plan.</b>  <a href="http://maximizebusinessmarketing.com/high-cost-non-performing-b2b-sales-people"><b>CSO Insights</b></a> <br>  Why?  Because it takes a lot of time to plan, prepare, etc.  Automate these processes, because you have to deal directly with sales. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/914/dfd/fb4/914dfdfb42e0a769d34586ed5e43dc76.png" alt="sales" width="583" height="341"></a> <br><br>  <b>24. 87% of employees do not have active involvement in work.</b>  <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2014/03/25/workplace-survey-says-87-of-employees-not-actively-engaged-in-their-jobs/"><b>Gallup</b></a> <br><br>  <b>25. 65% of managers complain that they cannot find suitable content to send it to a potential client.</b>  <a href="http://marketeer.kapost.com/sales-enablement-guide/"><b>Kapost</b></a> <b>&nbsp;</b><br>  This problem with saving content.  We solved it: all correspondence with the client remains in the history and is available in the user's card.  You do not need to ask the client a hundred times what he wants and who he is.  All correspondence, both from the mail and from the chat is stored in one place. <br><br><br><h2>  <b>miscellanea</b> </h2><br>  Every little thing is important.  In the list of these small but important facts, you can find everything from referral programs to positioning. <br><br>  <b>26. 91% of customers are ready to become partners, but only 11% of sales representatives offer it to them.</b> <b>&nbsp;</b>  <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/JakeAtwood1/20-shocking-sales-stats"><b>Dale carnegie</b></a> <br>  Affiliate referral program can be your direct route to new deals.  Lend your product to partners and think what you can get ... <br><br>  <b>27. Improving retention by just 5% can increase profits by more than 95%.</b>  <a href="http://www.bain.com/publications/articles/retaining-customers-is-the-real-challenge.aspx"><b>Bain &amp; Company</b></a> <br>  If you automate the process of communicating with the customer and establish communication after the sale, you can easily reduce the outflow rate. <br><br>  <b>28.
