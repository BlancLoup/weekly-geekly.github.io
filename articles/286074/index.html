  <section class="page js-page"><h1>25 years of Adobe Photoshop: between past and future</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  February 19, 2015 Adobe Photoshop is 25 years old.  This application still occupies a leading position in the world and is in widespread demand among designers and all those involved in the processing of photographs and images.  Photoshop was originally created by two brothers, John and Thomas Noll, as software for scanners.  But what now expects Photoshop?  What is the <a href="http://akvis.com/ru/articles/photoshop-history/index.php">path</a> he took in 25 years? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Back in 1988, the brothers began to look for investors for their project, which was then called Image Pro.  Many companies were interested in the development, but not all had the opportunity to buy the project. <br><br>  However, the brothers were able to agree on the supply of the program bundled with Barneyscan scanners.  And only some time later, Adobe agreed to acquire a startup.  So the project became part of the Adobe company called Photoshop, and in February 1990, the first official release of Adobe Photoshop 1.0 was released. <br><br>  However, Photoshop was not the first Adobe graphics editor.  Before him was created Adobe Illustrator.  But it was Photoshop that was recognized by users, despite some difficulty in mastering the program.  Because the decisive advantages of the application were powerful functionality and orientation to a wide range of users with different levels of training.  In addition, the cost of the program was incomparably lower than the cost of graphic applications designed for professionals.

      Today, Adobe is confidently looking to the future, but does not forget about its past.  On the occasion of the 25th anniversary, an advertising campaign has been launched, the essence of which is to demonstrate the work performed in Photoshop for famous films: Avatar, Disappeared, The Hobbit, How to Train Your Dragon 2 and Shrek.  A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Ffeature%3Dplayer_embedded%26v%3DQmYc1MNJaQc">promotional video</a> dedicated to the 25th anniversary, will be shown at the ceremony "Oscar". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/61c/561/c1f/61c561c1f00ad4fae6a4dc31cae5cef3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Adobe also launched a new campaign, during which the most creative young artists using Photoshop in their work will post their works on Instagram throughout the year.  Mandatory requirement - the age of artists should be close to 25 years. <br><br>  Zoran Guy, Senior Product Manager Photoshop, told us about the past and the future of the project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/989/16e/009/98916e0097c76b3893f7ac3a37ed3be9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  What has Photoshop achieved in 25 years? </h4><br>  It is difficult to say about one thing.  We have added new features, new ways to work with existing features.  We are in constant dialogue with our customers and try to meet their needs. <br>  We have improved the product so that the first acquaintance with it is as easy and pleasant as possible for designers, for photographers, as well as for all those who encounter image processing for the first time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/30e/11f/bd0/30e11fbd064cbee29ef86b00b4a37d11.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  What happened in the last 5 years?  Photoshop found its place in the field of mobile technology? </h4><br>  During the last 5 years we have conducted many experiments on working with mobile technologies.  And now we can offer you a version of Photoshop for all mobile platforms - Adobe Photoshop Mix.  Of course, there is still something to work on, but we have implemented the main functions. <br><br><h4>  What are you going to work on in the next 5 years? </h4><br>  We plan to continue developing Photoshop Mix, since right now we have interesting ideas on how to better organize the work of users on mobile devices. <br><br>  In addition, we plan to modify the architecture of Photoshop.  If we can separate the core logic and the user interface logic, then it will be possible to simultaneously develop several interface options at once without the need for kernel processing.  For example, the use of HTML5 / CCS will allow applying a new approach, thanks to which the interface will become clearer and more convenient for users. <br><br><h4>  How did the appearance of the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/ru/creativecloud.html">Creative Cloud</a> project influence the development of Photoshop?  After all, now the only way to access it is to subscribe to Creative Cloud. </h4><br><br>  People are just starting to understand the full benefits of Creative Cloud.  I especially want to mention the function Libraries.  Its main advantages are: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Access from any location <br>  ‚Ä¢ Convenient save in Creative Cloud Libraries <br>  ‚Ä¢ Permanent access to the necessary resources <br>  ‚Ä¢ Providing colleagues with access to their libraries <br><br>  You can share not ordinary objects, but objects that are directly used in Photoshop: Smart Objects, layers, 3D layers, PSD files, and so on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/d56/db9/9ee/d56db99eee3c109aef116e69ee00cef8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  The Creative Cloud service has already made a big <a href="http://www.ferra.ru/ru/games/news/2014/06/19/Adobe-Creative-Cloud-for-photographers/">concession to the</a> community of photographers in the form of a cheap subscription on an ongoing basis, but some are still unhappy.  Is Adobe thinking of giving a perpetual license to photographers? </h4><br><br>  Nothing can be 100% sure.  You never know what will happen tomorrow.  But we have already done a lot, so for now this is unlikely. <br><br><h4>  How does the company treat competition with other applications in those market segments that Adobe is starting to master? </h4><br>  Of course, there are many really successful apps like Instagram or VSCO.  They have already achieved a lot, and Adobe is just starting to move in this direction, and Creative Cloud is only the first step. <br><br><h4>  What is Adobe's position on the phenomenon of "photoshop"?  People rework the images as they like: they change the skin color, the shape of the face, body ... </h4><br><br>  We believe that, after all, our product is more used for good than for harm.  Nevertheless, we try to carefully guide our users in a positive direction. <br><br><h4>  What do you think about the attempts of other companies to compete with Photoshop? </h4><br>  We are very closely watching what is happening in the market and try to keep our positions. <br>  Competition is always good, because it forces you to be in good shape. <br><br><h4>  What do you think about Affinity Photo?  They have implemented a 4-channel color model, and this is a giant step from amateur to professional software. </h4><br><br>  Affinity's products have a lot in common with ours, especially the suite and desktop versions.  But while we can not say that they can be compared with Photoshop. <br><br><h4>  What would you like to say at the end? </h4><br>  We are experiencing a wonderful time.  Engineers are passionate about developing Creative Cloud.  We hope we can achieve a lot in cloud computing.  There is always something to work on - so I am still in this project. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286074/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286074/</a></p>
