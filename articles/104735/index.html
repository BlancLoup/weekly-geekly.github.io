This academic year, the final will be held in the summer of 2011 in <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D1%258C%25D1%258E-%25D0%2599%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA">New York</a> - this is a good excuse to redouble our efforts to get there.  If you have not registered for the competition on the site <a href="http://www.imaginecup.com/registration">http://www.imaginecup.com/registration</a> - do it right now to keep abreast of the news.  If you already participated in competitions last year - just go to <a href="http://www.imaginecup.com/">www.imaginecup.com</a> with your old name and password, after which you will need to go through a simple procedure for updating your password and profile - and go ahead, to victory! <br><br>  Imagine Cup has a lot of challenging and interesting contests, but there is one very simple one - a competition of administrators, or <b>IT Challenge</b> - and you can take part in it <b>today, September 22</b> (the next opportunity will be only after 3 weeks, October 19)!  In the first round of the competition, you only need to answer correctly 15 questions out of 30 - after which you pass to the next round.  In the second round, the tasks are more substantive, but they also do not require much time from you - you will need to describe the IT infrastructure that meets the specified requirements, as well as perform some tasks on remote virtual machines.  This is a good opportunity to practice in the administration of Windows-based systems - there are not so many <b>olympiads for administrators</b> ! <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      To participate you need to do the following steps: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://imaginecup.com/register">Register</a> or update your password.  If you have already participated in competitions last year - go to <a href="http://www.imaginecup.com/">www.imaginecup.com</a> with your old name and password, after which a new password will be sent to your e-mail, which can be used to participate in competitions of this year.  Go to the site with a new password, update your profile information (you can change the password at the same time) - and you can participate in competitions. </li><li>  Fill in the contact information <a href="http://imaginecup.com/my-profile">in your profile</a> . </li><li>  After that, the <strong>COMPETE</strong> button will appear <a href="http://imaginecup.com/competitions/it-challenge">on the IT Challenge page</a> - compete.  Click on it - and you will be asked to create a team - you will need to go through this simple procedure and create a team of one person.  Now you can be considered a full participant in the competition!  At the same time you can register for participation <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/rus/ImagineCup/about/categories.aspx">in other categories</a> .  After registration, the <strong>COMPETE</strong> button changes to <strong>TAKE QUIZ</strong> . </li><li>  After that - you will have to <a href="http://imaginecup.com/competitions/it-challenge">enter the site</a> (on the IT Challenge page) on one of the days when competitions are held, and within 30 hours to answer 30 questions.  The next day you will find out the results in the standings.  The first day of competition - today, September 22! </li><li>  Remember - you can take the test at any time of the day on a specified day (September 22 and other dates indicated below), but GMT.  Those.  Moscow time, the test opens somewhere at 3 am on that date, and closes at 3 am the next day. </li><li>  To prepare for the test, you can <a href="http://imaginecup.com/competitions/it-challenge/it-challenge-practice-quiz-start">take a training test</a> on any other day. </li><li>  When passing the test, I highly recommend using <a href="http://bing.com/">Bing</a> or any <a href="http://google.com/">other</a> search engine - often, it gives all the answers to the questions, the main thing is to formulate them correctly.  At the same time you can learn a lot about Microsoft products! </li></ul><br>  Test dates: <strong>September 22,</strong> 2010, <strong>October 19,</strong> 2010, <strong>November 2 and 18,</strong> 2010, <strong>December 3 and 15,</strong> 2010, <strong>January 14 and 31,</strong> 2011. You can participate in one or more tests - for passing in 2 Round Two It is enough to correctly answer 15 or more questions. <br>  Show yourself and show the world that Russian students are the best, and they are well-versed in Microsoft products too!  If you have questions about the test, the registration, or you just want to share your impressions of the test - write in the comments.  I will also be happy to answer questions <a href="http://twitter.com/shwars">on Twitter</a> .  The official twitter of the competition, from which you can get all the news - <a href="http://twitter.com/imcup">@imcup</a> . <br><br>  For those who do not speak much English, and want to compete with the administrators in Russia and the near abroad - we remind you that until the end of September, registration is open for the <a href="http://world-it-planet.org/">IT-Planet</a> Olympiad.
