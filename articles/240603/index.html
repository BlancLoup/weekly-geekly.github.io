Ideally, an additional ‚Äúmotherboard‚Äù with network and telephone plugs, power supply and FXO and FXS adapters and a connector for installing standard VoCore.  The FXS adapter could be discarded, but then in case of problems with electricity, you can remain without any connection (in the case of FXS, you can provide a direct connection of analog TA to the line when the power is turned off) <br><br>  The prototype is possible and exists, but I have not met, currently the functionality is organized on Mikrotik RB750GL (Openwrt) and Linksys SPA3102 (FXO / FXS).

My first successful project in this area is a six-legged hexapod robot.  Development of the hexapod began in 2010 and continues to this day, albeit at a much slower pace.  The robot was presented at major Ural exhibitions, such as Innoprom, defense exhibitions in N. Tagil, etc., and was also repeatedly shown on local TV channels. <br>  Robotics for me for the most part hobbies, hexapods and two-legged robots initially served as my graduation project at the end of college and undergraduate, respectively. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">More photos</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c19/658/075/c196580753d64ed6a67e283b92d9a75b.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c7a/f94/c5d/c7af94c5d1f7469eadc6f1dc39fcbc7b.JPG"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b9/582/0ef/4b95820ef47d45e38cda1f697116ac00.jpg"></div></div><br><br><h4>  <b>12.

For those who do not know what Mesh WiFi is: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/196562/">habrahabr.ru/post/196562</a> <br>  The idea: to make a device no larger than a charger unit from a mobile device, the heart of which will be VoCore, and when plugged in, it will automatically lift the WiFi network and connect to the WiFi Mesh.  This will allow you to easily and easily raise the Mesh WiFi node anywhere, besides, if you are not interested in Mesh, you can be content with a simple WiFi repeater. </blockquote><br>  <b>About the author:</b> <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hidden text</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  student, related experience only in the installation of OpenWrt, and other linux systems on a variety of hardware, from routers to PCs and tablets. </div></div><br><br><h4>  <b>13.

Next, the server finds this device, adds the necessary tables to the database itself, and on the web interface we see everything we need. <br>  For example, they wanted to add monitoring and temperature control in the boiler.  Please, half an hour on the config file and scripts, two hours to install in the boiler itself.  And that's it! <br><br>  This project is already quite a lot of time. <br>  Currently implemented dimmer.  With power in the gap or parallel to the consumer (light bulb).  Basis - STM controller, module nrf24l01.  Also implemented touch control.  The device has been working for more than half a year, there were no problems. <br><br>  By nutrition.  I use a very interesting power scheme.  The device is powered from the network of any alternating voltage from 12 to 600V (theoretically, it is practical to test only up to 380V).  We get the desired voltage and current up to 200mA (it is possible and more, but slightly changing the circuit. I need 200mA).  In general, the device can be powered both directly from the network and in the gap of any consumer - light bulbs, heaters, etc. <br><br>  When I started the project, I was looking for an opportunity to make a device with WiFi and preferably on Linux.  But I didn‚Äôt find any size I needed (which would fit into the switch case, considering that there are already two boards) for a normal price. <br></blockquote><br><br><h4>  <b>14.
