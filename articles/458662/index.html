I bring to your attention the translation of the article ‚Äú <a href="https://www.fraunhofer.de/en/press/research-news/2019/july/emi-assessing-the-danger-of-drone-strike.html">Assessing the danger of drone strike</a> ‚Äù. <br><br>  UAVs are rapidly gaining popularity around the world.  At the same time, the number of incidents with their participation is growing.  In 2017, in Canada, a passenger plane, landing, collided with a drone, but the disaster was avoided.  In the production of aircraft tested for poultry resistance, these procedures are required.  Tests with drones are not yet conducted.  The Institute for the Dynamics of the Fast-Flowing Processes of the Fraunhofer Society (Ernst Mach Institute) (EMI) wants to find out how dangerous the drones are for airplanes and how they will behave in various situations.  For this, a test bench will be developed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In recent years, drones are increasingly becoming a hindrance to air transport.  In 2018, 158 such cases were registered at German airports.  The federal police made a public statement that unmanned aerial objects pose a serious threat.  In early May this year, Frankfurt am Main Airport was forced to temporarily suspend work due to the drone.  It is estimated that the total number of drones in circulation in Germany will increase to 847,000 units by 2030, an increase of almost 80%.  UAVs are a threat not only to landing aircraft, but also to helicopters at low altitude.  Pilots fear that drones may crash into the windshield, touch the engine or wing toe.  Experts agree that drones can cause more serious damage than birds.  Airplanes are allowed to fly only if they have been tested for poultry resistance.  In the case of drones, no tests are carried out.  Researchers from the Freunburg Fraunhofer Institute EMI plan to change the situation.  "From the point of view of aeromechanics, the drone is very different from the bird in terms of behavior and weight."  - explains the doctor of sciences, Sebastian Schopferer, the project participant.  "Therefore, it is unclear whether the aircraft will be able to fight off the drone as successfully as the birds." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eee/924/815/eee9248155eb497b26583e212d1a7e3c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Michael May</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The use of UAVs near helicopters is prohibited.</i>

    <h4>  Great security risk </h4><br>  The first shock test only confirmed the dangers of batteries and UAV engines.  ‚ÄúWith the help of compressed air, we managed to start the battery and the engine at a speed of 115 to 255 m / s into an aluminum plate, 8mm thick,‚Äù continues Schopferer.  Because of their mass, both components are able to inflict serious damage.  ‚ÄúThe test resulted in significant deformation and dents on the plate, while the battery and the engine themselves flew apart.‚Äù The experiment was recorded on a high-speed video camera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a0b/535/2ff/a0b5352ff685e1bbc738ccc4ba18fee5.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Fraunhofer emi</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Standard lithium-ion battery (approximately 700g) for the drone</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c26/ac1/160/c26ac1160e013f5592add14f6a785690.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Fraunhofer emi</i> <i><br></i>  <i>This is what a battery looks like after meeting with an aluminum plate.</i> <br><br>  The main task of the tests is to determine the driving force at the time of collision with the aforementioned components of the drone and to calculate the damage for aircraft materials such as aluminum alloys and fiber composite material.  In addition, the researchers conducted several tests under quasi-static pressure to determine the strength and flexibility of the drone components.  The test results will help in building the required number of simulation models for the aviation industry.  Simulation models will provide an opportunity to assess the resistance of new materials to the impacts of UAVs. <br><br><h4>  Tests with full-sized drones </h4><br>  For the most realistic simulations, researchers are going to design a new test bench for testing entire UAVs with a mass of no more than 3kg and a speed of no more than 150m / s.  ‚ÄúWe will be able to study the extent of damage to both the objects themselves and drones.  We can test both flexible and inflexible objects.  In the end, most likely, make sure that drones can lead to disaster.  Nobody has ever conducted experiments with such heavy drones. ‚ÄùBoth amateur and semi-professional UAVs with a mass of 1-3kg will be tested.  These studies will help aircraft manufacturers and supervisors to more accurately assess the potential threat of an UAV to air transport. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/458662/">https://habr.com/ru/post/458662/</a></p>
