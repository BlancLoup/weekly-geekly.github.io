  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The Resurrection of Robert Plant</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I published this surge of emotions last year, in my blog on UCOZ.RU.  For some reason, I abandoned the blog and then closed it.  This material was seen only by two.  Recently, listening to my favorite music, I remembered it and again I wanted to share my joy with many.  Don't kick me very much, I just like it.  So, I quote myself. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Miracles sometimes happen!  And here it is - the next one.  The dinosaur of rock, which no one remembers (well, don't kick me, forty-fifty-year-old lovers of early music) has resurrected.  It would seem your hero died long ago.  So no!  Alive and still alive!  Robert Plant, the very same, as the former Western Led Zeppelin publishers write, recorded a disc completely uncharacteristic for him and LZ and, at the same time, very characteristic.  Snobs from ROK spit: ‚Äúugh, country filthy‚Äù and let them fail in their 1970 year.  There, unfading Black Dog and Stairway to Heaven are always ready for them.  No, we also love very much and sometimes even listen to these immortal masterpieces, but we also do not stop in our development.  We love everything worthy, honest.  Mom brought us up like this.  And Plant took and did a very honest job.  True, not one.  But this is another trick.  He "sang" with Alison Kraus, a beautiful girl whose voice takes to the soul, and femininity and sexuality bring down the representatives of the worst half of humanity.  The girl professes not the most fashionable genre today: bluegrass.  For those who do not know: country music is melodic.  He was still grateful Dead.  There was such a very fashionable group at the time. <br>  And, here this explosive mixture of melodic country and old rock gave an amazing result: the magic turned out!  I will not hum, you will beat, and you will not be able to sing.  It can only be two people on Earth. <br>  Ask, but what is there characteristic of LZ?  And you listen to Rich Woman and try to say that these are not zeppelins!  And a fortune teller?  And nothin?  He who has ears, let him hear! <br>  Listen!  Definitely listen!  Everyone, even moron!  Sit in the back rows, this is not an insult - this is the chorus, you just do not know the song.  All got pencils and write: Raising Sand.  So called this miracle in the form of an ordinary CD.  And it will be released officially on October 23, but we already know that there are miracles and someone, probably already listening to this disc.  And all the other law-abiding citizens on October 23 will go and buy a CD with such pearls: <br><br>  Rich Woman (Dorothy LaBostrie-McKinley Millet) <br>  Killing The Blues (Rowland Salley) <br>  Sister Rosetta Goes Before Us (Sam Phillips) <br>  Polly Come Home (Gene Clark) <br>  Gone, Gone, Gone (Done Moved On) (Phil and Don Everly) <br>  Through The Morning, Through The Night (Gene Clark) <br>  Please Read The Letter (Robert Plant-Michael Lee-Jimmy Page-Charlie Jones) <br>  Trampled Rose (Tom Waits-Kathleen Brennan) <br>  Fortune Teller (Naomi Neville) <br>  Stick With ME Baby (Mel Tillis) <br>  Nothin '(Townes Van Zandt) <br>  Let Your Loss Be Your Lesson (Milt Campbell) <br>  Your Long Journey (AD Watson and Rosa Lee Watson)
