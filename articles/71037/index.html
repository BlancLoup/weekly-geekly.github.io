Turnovers are small, the staff a little, the accountant is necessary only one, and it is simple to keep all tasks in the head.  In extreme cases, write in the diary.  In large companies, there are automated control systems and specially hired employees, whose duties are to systematize and provide the necessary information.  But medium-sized businesses have a hard time.  Expensive decisions and additional rates for it are ruinous, and the needs for business analytics are huge.  The competition at this level is very tense, and the information means a lot.  IBM Global CIO Study conducted a study and found out that 83% of managers of this scale consider business analytics to be the most important means in competition. <br><br>  In what it translates into practice, we all know.  The budget is limited, there are no people, it's expensive, and the burden falls on the shoulders of IT people.  As a result, IT resources are overwhelmed, trying to cope with information overload, flows of unstructured data are different all the time, the quality of their presentation suffers, the forces are taken away from other tasks - well, in general, the familiar picture. <br><br>  IBM decided: to help manage corporate finances, make plans, budgets and generate forecasts should not IT-specialists (they have other worries), but programs.  And the participants in the process themselves must enter information for analysis.  This is how the <b>IBM Cognos Express</b> product appeared, which will be launched on September 29 <a name="habracut"></a>
