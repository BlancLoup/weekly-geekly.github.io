This is a concept that assumes that when writing programs, first of all you create a special subject-oriented language, and then, in this subject-oriented language, you begin to write the actual program code. <br> <a href="http://wiki.4intra.net/index.php%3Ftitle%3DFile:Language_Oriented_Programming_%2528LOP%2529_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8_%2528%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD,_ADD-2011%2529.pdf%26amp%3Bpage%3D2"><img alt="Language Oriented Programming (LOP) in action (Maxim Mazin, ADD-2011) .pdf" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/81c/a00/64c/81ca0064cf7b9a98ec601343de65a3ec.jpg" height="384" width="512"></a> <br>  What is this for?

When programming using the Java, PHP or C # language, a problem arises - when programming a huge amount of boilerplate code arises;  such code, which will be repeated from time to time, but not because it does some meaningful work, but simply so that the compiler can compile this code. <br>  Write round brackets, dots, ... and so on. <br>  In the case when you use some kind of framework, then you still have additional pain from the framework. <br>  You need to initialize the library, open windows, set some properties, depending on what library you have. <br>  In principle, in many modern programming languages, for example, C #, there is a practice to add object-oriented constructions to the language. <br> <a href="http://wiki.4intra.net/index.php%3Ftitle%3DFile:Language_Oriented_Programming_%2528LOP%2529_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8_%2528%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD,_ADD-2011%2529.pdf%26amp%3Bpage%3D4"><img alt="Language Oriented Programming (LOP) in action (Maxim Mazin, ADD-2011) .pdf" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee9/0c5/aa0/ee90c5aa093ca7e041b3a6f97000cf9d.jpg" height="384" width="512"></a> <br>  In the Java language, there is a synchronized construct, which is not a general purpose construct, it is a special, object-oriented construct designed for parallel programming. <br> <a href="http://wiki.4intra.net/index.php%3Ftitle%3DFile:Language_Oriented_Programming_%2528LOP%2529_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8_%2528%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD,_ADD-2011%2529.pdf%26amp%3Bpage%3D5"><img alt="Language Oriented Programming (LOP) in action (Maxim Mazin, ADD-2011) .pdf" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/266/78a/59f/26678a59fbb8d06bbc029db47bbfc095.jpg" height="384" width="512"></a> <br>  Similarly, in the C ++ language, there is an operator overload.  Here, compare. <br>  Normally, if you didn‚Äôt have a synchronized construct, you would have to write this much code here. <br>  The ‚Äúfinally‚Äù block and blocking block, this is all a boilerplate code that is not always interesting to write. <br>  Instead, there is a synchronized DSL construction that allows you to lock the lock and does not worry about releasing it. <br> <a href="http://wiki.4intra.net/index.php%3Ftitle%3DFile:Language_Oriented_Programming_%2528LOP%2529_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8_%2528%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD,_ADD-2011%2529.pdf%26amp%3Bpage%3D6"><img alt="Language Oriented Programming (LOP) in action (Maxim Mazin, ADD-2011) .pdf" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ebd/86b/1a1/ebd86b1a1f544dfea807995e3258c11d.jpg" height="384" width="512"></a> <br>  Likewise, in C ++, there is a mechanism for operator overloading that allows you to pretend as if you have defined special operations, for example, on complex numbers. <br> <a href="http://wiki.4intra.net/index.php%3Ftitle%3DFile:Language_Oriented_Programming_%2528LOP%2529_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8_%2528%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD,_ADD-2011%2529.pdf%26amp%3Bpage%3D7"><img alt="Language Oriented Programming (LOP) in action (Maxim Mazin, ADD-2011) .pdf" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d81/e31/943/d81e3194336e4d63716013fab023c47c.jpg" height="384" width="512"></a> <br>  This is all very good, but as you know, read-write locks appeared in the Java language, starting from version 5, and this means for us that we need to write again the code of such a style as shown on the left: <br> <a href="http://wiki.4intra.net/index.php%3Ftitle%3DFile:Language_Oriented_Programming_%2528LOP%2529_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8_%2528%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD,_ADD-2011%2529.pdf%26amp%3Bpage%3D5"><img alt="Language Oriented Programming (LOP) in action (Maxim Mazin, ADD-2011) .pdf" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/266/78a/59f/26678a59fbb8d06bbc029db47bbfc095.jpg" height="384" width="512"></a> <br>  Those.  it is necessary to seize locks, lock locks, ... this all completely levels convenience. <br>  If it were possible to write ... independently expand languages, we would be able to solve various problems. <br>  For example, those constructions, language extensions that are, in the Java language, they allow you to solve a specific set of problems.  But we face other challenges in life.  For example, if we write a web application, then we need to work with databases, write a web level, and so on.  There is no DSL for this, there is only a framework. <br> <a href="http://wiki.4intra.net/index.php%3Ftitle%3DFile:Language_Oriented_Programming_%2528LOP%2529_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8_%2528%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD,_ADD-2011%2529.pdf%26amp%3Bpage%3D7"><img alt="Language Oriented Programming (LOP) in action (Maxim Mazin, ADD-2011) .pdf" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d81/e31/943/d81e3194336e4d63716013fab023c47c.jpg" height="384" width="512"></a> <br>  Similarly, if we use some kind of concept like dependency injection, then we also need to use frameworks for this, and even worse, use mixtures of languages, write simultaneously in Java, in XML, and all this is not very fun. <br>  And the main thing is that we cannot do anything about it, because the creation of language expansion threatens us with various risks. <br> <a href="http://wiki.4intra.net/index.php%3Ftitle%3DFile:Language_Oriented_Programming_%2528LOP%2529_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8_%2528%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD,_ADD-2011%2529.pdf%26amp%3Bpage%3D8"><img alt="Language Oriented Programming (LOP) in action (Maxim Mazin, ADD-2011) .pdf" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/103/7d9/adc/1037d9adc8c45f1ace7e7d95b668452a.jpg" height="384" width="512"></a> <br>  What problems arise when creating a DSL and why, if there is any need, do not immediately rush to create a DSL? <br> <a href="http://wiki.4intra.net/index.php%3Ftitle%3DFile:Language_Oriented_Programming_%2528LOP%2529_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8_%2528%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD,_ADD-2011%2529.pdf%26amp%3Bpage%3D9"><img alt="Language Oriented Programming (LOP) in action (Maxim Mazin, ADD-2011) .pdf" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a39/514/a94/a39514a9410afcfd22e74febb2fc9d56.jpg" height="384" width="512"></a> <br>  The biggest problem that everyone faces when trying to create a DSLay is the compatibility of language extensions. <br>  Compatibility refers to the ability to simultaneously use two language extensions that are created by independent developers. <br> <a href="http://wiki.4intra.net/index.php%3Ftitle%3DFile:Language_Oriented_Programming_%2528LOP%2529_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8_%2528%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD,_ADD-2011%2529.pdf%26amp%3Bpage%3D10"><img alt="Language Oriented Programming (LOP) in action (Maxim Mazin, ADD-2011) .pdf" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f8d/f14/d1d/f8df14d1df4e997347608bb7019261a4.jpg" height="384" width="512"></a> <br>  For example.  If you have some libraries and frameworks, in our case for Java, for example <br>  Hibernate, Spring or Joda Time, they are all compatible with each other, in principle, at the compilation level. <br>  Those.  You can use both Hibernate and Spring components in your project at the same time, and nothing can stop you. <br>  But if you have language add-ins, in the form of some macros, or some other techniques that add object-oriented constructs to your Java language, then these add-ins are created independently, all the time there is a risk that these add-ins will clash with each other. <br> <a href="http://wiki.4intra.net/index.php%3Ftitle%3DFile:Language_Oriented_Programming_%2528LOP%2529_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8_%2528%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD,_ADD-2011%2529.pdf%26amp%3Bpage%3D11"><img alt="Language Oriented Programming (LOP) in action (Maxim Mazin, ADD-2011) .pdf" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3da/15e/e5c/3da15ee5c8c9c562cc1438430c7a2e58.jpg" height="384" width="512"></a> <br> <a href="http://wiki.4intra.net/index.php%3Ftitle%3DFile:Language_Oriented_Programming_%2528LOP%2529_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8_%2528%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD,_ADD-2011%2529.pdf%26amp%3Bpage%3D12"><img alt="Language Oriented Programming (LOP) in action (Maxim Mazin, ADD-2011) .pdf" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/404/9b1/448/4049b14481439655605b5bf532a694a7.jpg" height="384" width="512"></a> <br>  For example, such a very simple example. <br>  Suppose we have an extension from somewhere that does something useful, and in particular supports the interpolation of expressions in strings. <br>  You can write such a construct, and the value of this expression will be substituted for ‚ÄúresultCount‚Äù. <br>  At the same time, another language extension comes to our friend, which allows us to do something useful and, in particular, also interpolate strings.  In Java, there is no interpolation of strings, so it is expected that different people will release it in different language extensions. <br>  And let's say the syntax is slightly different.  Then, when sharing language extensions A and B, you instantly have a fatal ambiguity, how to interpret this buzz. <br>  This example is very simple, but in fact, everyone who creates a DSL based on textual information, one way or another, is faced with a problem, they probably have no confidence that the extensions will not be contradictory. <br> <a href="http://wiki.4intra.net/index.php%3Ftitle%3DFile:Language_Oriented_Programming_%2528LOP%2529_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8_%2528%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD,_ADD-2011%2529.pdf%26amp%3Bpage%3D13"><img alt="Language Oriented Programming (LOP) in action (Maxim Mazin, ADD-2011) .pdf" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/743/b85/f93/743b85f930dea6138741feaf4ae7f74b.jpg" height="384" width="512"></a> <br>  Another problem that prevents us from creating DSLi.  Assume nonetheless, despite the difficulties and problems with the compatibility of different extensions, you decide to write a DSL. <br>  Write some preprocessor, set this preprocessor to your program. <br>  your DSL constructs, it compiles and issues some kind of code, bytecode, for example, <br>  or some executable code. <br>  This is all very good, but in our time, no one writes code without using an IDE. <br>  This is not done simply, because without the use of IDE, developer productivity is dramatically reduced. <br>  Therefore, in most cases, when you create such a DSL, there will be situations where your developers, your colleagues, will prefer to use just the Java language in Idea, just the C # language together with ReSharper, rather than take your share, and write something with your help. because there is no IDE support. <br> <a href="http://wiki.4intra.net/index.php%3Ftitle%3DFile:Language_Oriented_Programming_%2528LOP%2529_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8_%2528%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD,_ADD-2011%2529.pdf%26amp%3Bpage%3D14"><img alt="Language Oriented Programming (LOP) in action (Maxim Mazin, ADD-2011) .pdf" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/979/ad0/ff5/979ad0ff5d4dd44457ac558e759be57e.jpg" height="384" width="512"></a> <br>  IDE support means all features that modern IDEs provide to a developer.

You can enter XML, and most importantly, generate XML from your code. <br> <a href="http://wiki.4intra.net/index.php%3Ftitle%3DFile:Language_Oriented_Programming_%2528LOP%2529_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8_%2528%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD,_ADD-2011%2529.pdf%26amp%3Bpage%3D27"><img alt="Language Oriented Programming (LOP) in action (Maxim Mazin, ADD-2011) .pdf" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dc6/84e/664/dc684e6644c04adaaf3e8c45b5691b3e.jpg" height="384" width="512"></a> <br>  Well, there are still a number of languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat are designed to create languages. <br>  MPS in terms of creating languages ‚Äã‚Äãis quite fair (??? 16:20) <br>  Instead of a demonstration, it looks something like this ‚Üë. <br>  I‚Äôm not showing it from my computer, so everyone who is interested in the demonstration is invited to the stand in the hallway. <br>  See here how easy it is to take and support the support of a language construct. <br> <a href="http://wiki.4intra.net/index.php%3Ftitle%3DFile:Language_Oriented_Programming_%2528LOP%2529_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8_%2528%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD,_ADD-2011%2529.pdf%26amp%3Bpage%3D29"><img alt="Language Oriented Programming (LOP) in action (Maxim Mazin, ADD-2011) .pdf" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/44d/db1/dca/44ddb1dca0f3e8032c01292772000976.jpg" height="384" width="512"></a> <br>  In fact, this is all I wanted to tell, there are a few important things left. <br> <a href="http://wiki.4intra.net/index.php%3Ftitle%3DFile:Language_Oriented_Programming_%2528LOP%2529_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8_%2528%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD,_ADD-2011%2529.pdf%26amp%3Bpage%3D30"><img alt="Language Oriented Programming (LOP) in action (Maxim Mazin, ADD-2011) .pdf" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b1d/09a/664/b1d09a66459be7f292587352526fe719.jpg" height="384" width="512"></a> <br>  MSP is not only suitable for creating language extensions, i.e.  Not only in Java, you can add constructs that are missing in them, but you can also create some kind of your own DSLs. <br>  For example, Martin Fowler created a language to describe his financial statements. <br> <a href="http://wiki.4intra.net/index.php%3Ftitle%3DFile:Language_Oriented_Programming_%2528LOP%2529_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8_%2528%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD,_ADD-2011%2529.pdf%26amp%3Bpage%3D31"><img alt="Language Oriented Programming (LOP) in action (Maxim Mazin, ADD-2011) .pdf" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cab/3a6/49b/cab3a649ba00515c7e157a0e532e1957.jpg" height="384" width="512"></a> <br>  In addition, with the help of MPS, we wrote YouTrack, such a big bugtracker is big, in the sense of having a lot of code (generated).  But my previous development experience tells me that the code is informative, which we write and edit, this code is quite small. <br>  Again, we are interested, we can show at the output what the code looks like in the editor, how many tables there are. <br>  The code is quite small, due to the fact that the level of abstraction is raised quite high. <br>  For the development of YouTrack, a set of languages ‚Äã‚Äãwas created, some of these languages ‚Äã‚Äãare open, and some are closed. <br>  We do not give them away yet, because they have not yet achieved selling quality. <br> <a href="http://wiki.4intra.net/index.php%3Ftitle%3DFile:Language_Oriented_Programming_%2528LOP%2529_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8_%2528%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD,_ADD-2011%2529.pdf%26amp%3Bpage%3D32"><img alt="Language Oriented Programming (LOP) in action (Maxim Mazin, ADD-2011) .pdf" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bd9/866/ec7/bd9866ec7a90f77e4cbc952dd836cf21.jpg" height="384" width="512"></a> <br>  Here, the application is real, alive. <br> <a href="http://wiki.4intra.net/index.php%3Ftitle%3DFile:Language_Oriented_Programming_%2528LOP%2529_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8_%2528%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD,_ADD-2011%2529.pdf%26amp%3Bpage%3D33"><img alt="Language Oriented Programming (LOP) in action (Maxim Mazin, ADD-2011) .pdf" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0c4/e8b/a2b/0c4e8ba2b5074034a3a9db74a25a749b.jpg" height="384" width="512"></a> <br>  MPS has a positive property.
