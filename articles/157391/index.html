  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Comparison of Microsoft Office under Windows and Mac from the perspective of office use: what to look for</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> In this article I would like to share my personal experience of directly comparing Microsoft Office under Windows and Mac;  I will try to summarize most of the questions and nuances that arise when thinking about both an individual transition and the translation of organizations and groups. <br><br>  I consider my individual experience quite representative due to the fact that I have been a professional user of Microsoft Office since 1996.  I have been professionally as an author, reviewer and editor since 1996 every day (maybe, except for the wedding day) I have to be in Microsoft Office literally around the clock.  About 25‚Äì30 Word files and 15‚Äì20 Powerpoint files containing any possible functions pass through me per day.  sufficiently large and complex (Word, as a rule, not less than 200 pages; Powerpoint, as a rule, not less than 70 slides).  Over the past 14 years, I have tried all available versions of Microsoft Office on all existing versions of Windows.  I hope that the features that attracted my attention will be representative of softer scenarios.  I wanted to bring some clarity, because  on the one hand, Microsoft itself and most business users in the United States claim full compatibility, while in most cases the opposite is heard in runet. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I. What versions worked side by side and compared?  What versions were involved in ‚Äúside compatibility‚Äù testing? <br>  1. Microsoft Office for Mac 2011 running OS X 10.6, 10.7 and 10.8 was compared for 19 months with Microsoft Office 2003, 2007 and 2010 on Windows XP SP3, Windows 7, Windows 8. All versions were current and updated.

      2. Counterparties - i.e.  The authors and final recipients of the documents in progress were about 6500 users of Microsoft Office 2003 and (by 90%) 2007 under Wndows XP (by 90%) and Windows 7 (by 10%).  Office 2010 was also in isolated cases. <br><br>  Ii.  Why Microsoft Office? <br><br>  Unfortunately, no other office suites were used under the conditions described above - OpenOffice, LibreOffice, which is on Windows, OS X, and separately on OS X, NeoOffice, Symphony, iWork opened large partitioned documents with rich formatting, distorting them.  The number of pages and their borders differed.  It should be noted that with each other the similarity of these distortions was quite high, i.e.  It seems that Microsoft Word is fundamentally different from others.  It is this reason that, unfortunately, ultimately limited the choice of an operating system for us only by those that have a native Microsoft Office (for example, Debian, FreeBSD, and Haiku in virtual machines, therefore, they are not used for office needs, except perhaps opening a client bank in read mode). <br><br>  Iii.  What components are we analyzing? <br><br>  Mostly Word and Powerpoint.  Briefly close the question on others: <br>  1. Excel: no features are noted, all files created in Windows are perfectly open, and vice versa.  Complex functions are not involved, all arithmetic formulas and filters work as usual.  Attention: combinations of hot keys are different (for example, to create a new line in a cell), sometimes it is not logical to google. <br>  2. Microsoft Outlook: the version for Mac and Windows has been used as the main email client for about a year.  There are no fundamental differences found.  They are very convenient and fit organically into native mac applications (by the type of types in the Finder) switching of types by Cmd + 1,2,3,4 - mail, calendar, tasks, etc.  All AutoCorrect and the Microsoft Office dictionary inside Outlook are supported.  The calendar is perfectly synchronized with the native application (but not with google through it! It turns into only one of the calendars on my mac. The colors of the calendars are preserved).  With migration, import, export between Outlook and Mail, there are no problems.  It is decorated on 4+, beautifully, but the devil is in the details - for example, the date format does not change when the column is stretched (and in the native mailer the date will be in a format in which the width of the column allows). <br><br>  Testing Outlook for Mac has been discontinued due to the conclusion that this application is inappropriate against the background of native Apple Mail.  The main thing, than Mail immediately kills Outlook for me personally: <br>  - an opportunity in the new three-pane view and in full-screen mode on a large monitor with a preview of 5 lines in the central column to see the full text of all about 12 letters simultaneously.  Outlook is not bad, but at the same time seeing so much information - and reading one letter in large format, and seeing the text of 12 others - it does not allow, even a picture cannot be done, because in every screenshot from Mail there will be dozens of phones in signatures. <br>  - coloring separately the text and background of letters in any colors (from the system palette, at least a thousand) depending on the rules and filters.  Suppose you can set your letter color for each sender, and it is implemented perfectly. <br>  Mail also has higher integration with system calendars (automatic recognition of contacts and events), reminders, Applescript and Finder, i.e.  for example, it is easier to configure sending a file using hotkeys, as well as more hotkeys for spreading letters.  Therefore, I don‚Äôt see any sense in using Outlook for Mac, the main thing is to make the outgoing encoding in Mail just plain text instead of rich - recipients will not have problems on Outlook / Lotus.  Of course, much depends on the planning tools, if instead of native solutions we continue to work with Outlook calendars and tasks, the mail in it makes more sense. <br><br>  Iv.  Cross-platform compatibility of Microsoft Word and Powerpoint <br><br>  1. Attention: Not all fonts created on Windows can be read in Microsoft Office for Mac.  Specifically, I ran into one example - Arial Narrow, showing empty squares.  When selecting the text and changing the font, the text is perfectly displayed in the new font, so personally, in my case, this was not a problem, maybe the rest will be important.  Most likely, the problem is solved by actively adding the necessary fonts to the system - I don‚Äôt know, there was no point in dealing with them.  The main fonts are Verdana (it seems to be the safest thing for the eyes), Arial and dozens of others are read.  Specifically, Arial Narrow after multiple office updates specifically now (Microsoft Office for Mac 14.2.4, OS X 10.8) is also read, i.e.  I am currently unable to reproduce any specific example of an unsupported font.  Previously, there were problems with Arial Narrow, which had to be transferred to any other, perhaps now they are solved.  In any case, in the settings there is a certain option Font substitution, fortunately not needed and not needed anymore. <br>  2. Word formatting: no differences and no incompatibilities in the hard mode described at the beginning of the review could be identified (I estimate the sample as 15‚Äì20 thousand large documents with any formatting).  I know that there were problems with the previous package - Microsoft Office 2008, but occasionally reading the messages about problems with the package from 2011, I was very surprised by this, because  I can not play them.  I would be very happy to consider (and, most likely, eliminate!) Any specific examples of any formatting distortion in personal mail. <br>  3. Powerpoint formatting: attention - presentations made in Windows can look on a poppy with too wide text that clearly crawls out of the slide.  In Windows, the same slide will look fine.  As for the slides made on the poppy, they are displayed in Windows normally. <br>  4. Statistics.  The office on the poppy shows a little less than words and characters (probably, it will be important for copywriters, etc.).  Why - could not figure out.  The file itself by system means weighs more kilobytes (but this applies to other files and in this case is not in the subject). <br>  5. Dictionary - dic files are perfectly loaded and used cross-platform. <br>  6. Auto-replacements: attention - for Windows and Mac offices unfortunately these are different files that cannot be used cross-platform.  Most likely, if desired, they can be recoded (this is a simple text that is easily displayed in rtf in both cases), and I would be grateful for the search for such a solution.  But at the user level, auto-replacement cannot be used on another platform.  At the same time within the office, they work equally predictable. <br>  7. If in Microsoft Office for Mac to open a document made on Microsoft Office 2007 to one of the old updates ... many spaces will disappear.  And if after that you open the document in any office on Windows, they will already be missing too.  The problem has long been solved in some of the updates to Microsoft Office 2007, observed only when receiving files from non-updated first releases. <br><br>  V. Pluses Microsoft Office for Mac <br>  1. Combinations of two menus - the classic Makovsky menu of the application in the top panel (in this case, this is the classic menu of Microsoft Office 2003) and the ribbon under it. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c31/f1f/6f9/c31f1f6f96cccc17d75a2c2e6eb4ea4c.png" alt="image"><br>  As a person who quickly got used to the tape and worked confidently in the offices of 2007-2010, I have to admit that the objective time for finding any necessary function in the poppy version is thus less.  A specific example: creating a keyboard shortcut for a function (show statistics, show language, create autochange) takes 3 clicks more in the Windows version. <br>  2. All 3 modifiers are available for the key combinations - Cmd, Ctrl, Alt.  In Windows, you cannot use the Win key for office commands, so the Mac will either have two or one and a half times more key combinations.  Since I used to keep the Cmd key behind native native combinations, and the Alt key to assign pan-system calls (mostly programs, folders and scripts), the main custom modifier, for example, Ctrl.  The point is that in Windows, everything is initially rendered on Ctrl, while Win is disabled, only Alt (+ combinations) remains from single-key.  On the Mac, the original native commands are moved to Cmd, only Ctrl and Alt (+ combinations) are free from single-key commands.  But if on the alt poppy is used for system launchers such as Keyboard Maestro, Quicksliver, Alfred, then in both cases the modifier remains alone. <br>  A concrete example: in Microsoft Office for Windows, Ctrl + A = select all.  If I need a hot combination for Greek alpha, containing the letter "a" and one modifier to it, remains Alt + a.  Initially, Cmd + A = select everything on the Mac, so Ctrl and Alt remain for customization (if Alt is not used for pan-system calls, let‚Äôs say if Alt + A does not open the African pictures folder or the Activity Monitor program, one can be made for Greek alpha and the second for Swedish A with a circle). <br>  3. It is not entirely clear why (especially the use of RAM in Nix? You need to look here, what the initial restriction is connected with), but after warning of the type ‚Äútoo many spelling errors to continue to show‚Äù (for example, in a 400-page technical text) Microsoft Word for Mac ... like a sturdy tin soldier, quietly continues to show them. <br>  4. I never managed to get the patient to hang. <br>  5. Always open any files created in Microsoft Office for Windows that cannot be opened by other Microsoft Office for Windows.  It is also unclear why, but a common situation: in person A of Microsoft Office 2007 on Windows, in person B is the same.  I am standing in a copy of the letter from A to B with the attached file.  B complains that he does not open the file, I open and resave, everyone is happy.  Maybe this is a generation difference (2011 is still an analogue of 2010 and should be better in terms of compatibility than 2007). <br>  6. Very fast scrolling with two fingers - literally half a second to any place on the document.  If the scroll benchmark is considered to be an instant pdf scrolling in the native Preview, then it is close enough and much better than, for example, in Chrome or when opening pdf with Adobe tools.  Being located in the right place of the document takes a little less time than in Windows. <br><br>  Vi.  Cons Microsoft Office for Mac <br>  1. Disgusting work with the menu "search", "replacement".  If in each document you have to enter some text into the search-replace fields, Microsoft Office for Mac can be infuriating.  I don‚Äôt know where Microsoft didn‚Äôt grow together with Cocoa API, but if the cursor is in after a search-replace, then you can only act with the mouse and text, and any keyboard commands will be executed with respect to the main document field.  Those.  typed something into the buffer, go to the search / replace field, and ... by Cmd + V, the text is inserted into the document itself!  By Cmd + A, the entire text of the main document is highlighted.  A mouse ‚Äúinsert‚Äù, ‚Äúcopy‚Äù, in the same place with a keyboard and a backspace, a post and a prayer‚ò∫ Moreover, the ‚Äúmisunderstanding‚Äù of the program of where we are now comes to the fact that I select the phrase in the document, enter it into the search, copy in ‚Äúreplace with‚Äù, I begin to rule there ... - and it is corrected directly in the document, which of course is undesirable behavior.  Maybe for the solution you need to rummage through the menu, but it‚Äôs more like an <u>obvious glitch that Microsoft should preferably fix</u> . <br>  2. Disgusting work with text boxes and flowcharts - sometimes they are extremely difficult to edit, even though they don‚Äôt present any problems in the Windows version.  It was not possible to find out what features of the creation it depends on. <br>  3. A strange and offensive feature of Microsoft Word for Mac - when retrospective comparison, it tends to show deletions in the form of side comments (Deleted:‚Ä¶.) Instead of strikethroughs.  This does not apply to track changes per se, but when retrospectively comparing with all the similarly-ticked checkboxes in Windows, you will cross out the deleted text.  For example, it is more convenient for me to track deleted text if it is shown in strikethrough. <br><br>  VII.  Integration of Microsoft Office for Mac into native OS X environment. <br>  This could probably be important for people with experience in OS X who have not chosen the office suite.  For the switchers, this is most likely unimportant. <br>  Let's just say bad.  Pre-existing solutions in the system are often ignored, mostly Microsoft Office for Mac was written as if under an empty program opener.  But with every update the situation improves. <br>  1. Attention - system autochange is not supported. <br>  2. Not all system hotkeys are supported (suddenly: Cmd + N -no! Naturally, you can create such a command. Cmd +, and Cmd + S from the box, yes). <br>  3. For a long time, I couldn‚Äôt find myself files with automatic changes, from 10.6 to 10.8 I repeatedly changed my localization and at one time at 10.7 were not even transferred between computers (although I didn‚Äôt try to dig deep inside to show the contents of the package).  Now this problem is fixed. <br>  4. In 10.7, at first, Microsoft Office ignored the binding to the desired desktop, opening where it pleases.  Now the problem is fixed. <br>  5. At 10.7, at the beginning, Microsoft Office did not switch to real full-screen mode from its desktop.  Now the problem is fixed.  An example of Mission Control with finally (half a year ago it was difficult to imagine) correctly left Microsoft Word: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e6b/bba/552/e6bbba552301897abb5bc4920e711b84.png" alt="image"><br>  6. Restoration of all unclosed windows during reboots is normal, as it should be. <br>  7. Very important: scaling with 2 fingers does not work.  The scale has to be reduced approximately as in Windows with several tools to choose from, but not by moving the fingers apart, a fat minus compared to other programs. <br><br>  Viii.  Pitfalls (other than IV) <br>  Be sure the first thing: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/571/3df/996/5713df996041264277d25eab5670de5c.png" alt="image"><br>  Enabled by default, cannot work. <br>  We often hear about some problems with Home / end, supposedly moving to the beginning and end of the document - on the large Apple extended keyboard under OS X 10.8, the Home and end buttons work exactly the same as in Windows. <br><br>  I hope the material will be useful to all those who are accustomed to working in Microsoft Office under Windows and are interested in how this experience can be transferred to OS X. For me personally, as a 14-year-old intensive user of Microsoft Office, 2011 for Mac seems to be the best of all. who had to work.  I also consider this office suite the best for those who need to intensively exchange hard-formatted files with Windows.  However, there are several points, both solvable and potentially unsolvable, which should be remembered.  What came out well in Microsoft office for Mac is control (quick function call and customization control), stability, compatibility.  What turned out worse - editorial work (comparisons, system edits).  Based on the comments, I definitely note separately the absence of Visio and Access (well, this is obvious initially), the need to weigh the necessary Outlook features in the corporate network.  Well, who has any ideas about converting MSO1049.acl files into Microsoft Office ACL [Russian] - I would be very happy to see a working solution for transferring autochange. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/157391/">https://habr.com/ru/post/157391/</a></p>
