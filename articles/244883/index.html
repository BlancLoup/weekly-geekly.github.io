  <section class="page js-page"><h1>VMware Certification</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  VMware certification is aimed at technical specialists who want to show professional knowledge and experience in the field of virtualization - one of the most promising areas of IT at the moment.  VMware certification can be divided into four areas: <br>  <b>Data Center Virtualization</b> is the oldest direction (and until recently the only one), this line is the main one and concerns vSphere products. <br>  <b>Cloud</b> - the direction associated with products for building private, public and hybrid clouds, such as the products of the VMwarevCloudSuite line. <br>  <b>End User Computing</b> is a direction associated with the construction of virtual table infrastructures (VDI), based on the products of the VMware Horizon View line (previously it was called VMware View). <br>  <b>Network Virtualization</b> is the newest direction associated with the virtualization of network infrastructure in the data center and the products of the VMware NSX line. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  There are four steps to certification as well as four directions; you can see them in the following picture: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e45/6a2/422/e456a24224794e318be6faccd9c9226d.png"><br>  Here you can add three exams related to the development on the SpringSource platform, which do not overlap with the infrastructure certifications: <br>  <a href="https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm%3Fplan%3D31110%26ui%3Dwww_cert">Certified Spring Professional</a> <br>  <a href="https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm%3Fplan%3D31111%26ui%3Dwww_cert">Certified Spring Web Application Developer</a> <br>  <a href="https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm%3Fplan%3D31113%26ui%3Dwww_cert">Certified Spring Enterprise Integration Specialist</a> <br>  Now let's take a closer look at certification by direction. <br><br><h2>  VMware Data Center Virtualization. </h2><br>  <strong><i>VMware Certified Associate Data Center Virtualization</i></strong> ( <a href="https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm%3Fplan%3D41162%26ui%3Dwww_cert">VCA-DCV</a> ) - the initial step in the specialization of dedicated data center virtualization. <br>  To obtain certification you must: <br>  - <a href="https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/courses.cfm%3Fui%3Dwww_edu%26a%3Ddet%26amp%3Bid_course%3D189018">pass free online training</a> <br>  - <a href="https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm%3Fplan%3D41162%26amp%3Bui%3Dwww_cert">pass a paid online exam</a> <br>  The exam is fairly straightforward, mainly in terms of product overview and knowledge of VMware products.  It is an online test (which can be taken from anywhere) with questions and answers.  The exam consists of 50 questions, you need to score 300 points (you can score 100-500 points in total), 75 minutes are given for the exam. <br><br>  <strong><i>VMware Certified Professional Data Center Virtualization</i></strong> ( <a href="https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm%3Fplan%3D12457%26ui%3Dwww_cert">VCP-DCV</a> ) is the next step in data center virtualization specialization. <br>  Obtaining a certificate is possible in several ways.

The exam itself is a test with simulations, is also not particularly difficult. <br>  The VCP550 exam has 135 questions, for which 120 minutes of time are allocated (plus another 30 minutes for them, for countries where English is not the main language).  To pass, you need to score 300 points (you can only score from 100 to 500 points). <br><br>  <strong><em>VMware Certified Advanced Professional 5 - Data Center Administration</em></strong> ( <a href="https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm%3Fplan%3D30483%26ui%3Dwww_cert">VCAP5-DCA</a> ) - certification for advanced vSphere administrators, as well as consultants and virtualization engineers. <br>  For certification is required: <br>  1) Have current VCP status <br>  2) Complete one of the courses (optional): <br><ul><li>  vSphere: Optimize &amp; Scale [V5.1] </li><li>  vSphere: Optimize &amp; Scale [V5.5] </li><li>  vSphere: Troubleshooting Workshop [V5.5] </li></ul><br>  3) Pass the VDCA550 or VDCA510 exam <br>  Examinations are also available for two versions of vSphere - 5.1 and 5.5, respectively.  The exam is a large three-hour laboratory work, but if you pass in the Russian Federation (where English is not the main language), then you will add another 30 minutes.  In the lab, you will have a remote test bench and 23 tasks that need to be performed in vSphere.  To pass, you need to score 300 points (you can only score from 100 to 500 points). <br><br>  <strong><em>VMware Certified Advanced Professional 5 - Data Center Design</em></strong> ( <a href="https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm%3Fplan%3D30484%26ui%3Dwww_cert">VCAP5-DCD</a> ) - designed for IT architects working with virtualization products from VMware. <br>  For certification is required: <br>  1) Have current VCP status <br>  2) Complete one of the courses (optional): <br><ul><li>  vSphere: Design Workshop [V5.x] </li></ul><br>  3) Pass the VDCD550 or VDCD510 exam <br>  Exam is available for vSphere 5.5 and 5.1.  The exam consists of two parts, in the first part you are given 225 minutes (for those who donate in countries where English is not the main language, another 30 minutes is added to 195 minutes), while the second part must be left at least 30 minutes.  In the first part there will be 46 questions - 41 of them test + drag &amp; drop, and 5 more questions - a special design simulation.  The second part is called the ‚Äúmaster design item‚Äù - it is a complex design simulation, as I said above, it is necessary to leave at least 30 minutes for it (otherwise the exam will not be counted).  To pass it is enough to score 300 points (you can get from 100 to 500). <br><br>  <strong><em>VMware Certified Design Expert 5 - Data Center Virtualization</em></strong> ( <a href="https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm%3Fplan%3D33270%26ui%3Dwww_cert">VCDX5-DCV</a> ) - the highest level in VMware virtualization exams for data centers. <br>  The exam consists of designing complex architects in deploying VMware at the level of a large enterprise.  The VCDX5-DCV certification is achieved through a unique design protection process, where all candidates must submit and successfully defend the finished work of the VMware Solution to a group of professionals with VCDX-DCV status. <br>  For certification is required: <br>  1) Have the current status of VCAP5-DCA or VCAP5-DCD <br>  2) Complete one of the courses (optional): <br><ul><li>  vSphere: Design Workshop [V5.x] </li></ul><br>  3) Protect work-design VCDX5-DCV <br>  Protection should last about two hours, of which at least 15 minutes should be a presentation with your design, a story about your design 15 minutes, answers to questions in discussion mode (about an hour), a story about problems in design development in discussion mode (during 30 minutes) and a story about troubleshooting when implementing a solution (15 minutes).  The exam, of course, is only in English. <br><br><br><h2>  VMware Cloud. </h2><br>  <strong><em>VMware Certified Associate - Cloud</em></strong> ( <a href="https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm%3Fplan%3D41165%26ui%3Dwww_cert">VCA-Cloud</a> ) is an initial step in specializing in data center virtualization and cloud services products based on VMware products.
