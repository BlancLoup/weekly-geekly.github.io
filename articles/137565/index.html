Samsung concept hit parade</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fcc/afa/47c/fccafa47c1086b727168f73322cfb26c.png"><br>  Dear habrovchane, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/samsung/blog/137366/">asking</a> you last week about what device you would realize, we remembered a lot of concepts, prototypes and just people‚Äôs fantasies about the future Samsung devices that appeared on the network in different years.  Of course, writing here about everything would be superfluous, so we decided to make a small hit parade of the most thoughtful, unusual and interesting conceptual products associated with the name of our company. <br>  So welcome to the future ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/07d/3db/275/07d3db2757e29ab227da22a1601e8ccf.png"><br>  <b>Notebook-typewriter from Pedro Machado</b> <br>  This concept was in our top list only because of its unusualness.  It is unlikely that any manufacturer would come up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãreleasing such a device, but we nevertheless decided to mark it in our chart for the courage of the idea.  We are talking about a concept that combines the features of a laptop and a typewriter, a chimera that was born in the head of Portuguese designer Pedro Machado. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/935/a9e/9ed/935a9e9eda047cb3bc93d0a4b4615c99.png">

      According to the creator, this device should become a favorite tool of a writer or a journalist, because its ergonomics is fully optimized for printing: the concept laptop has a convenient (for stationary use), housing to the rear, a large display that remotely resembles a sheet of paper and a comfortable keyboard made in the image of the keys of a typewriter (although we have big doubts about its comfort).  In general, Pedro turned out to be a rather unusual, albeit an unviable concept.  But, probably, the author himself was well aware of this, creating it more likely to pay tribute to the ancient Remingtons and Underwoods, rather than with the hope of once bringing it to life. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/874/6d5/7d4/8746d57d41d20b4ce7137eaa7e76c10d.png"><br>  <b>Samsung Galaxy S II Bang &amp; Olufsen by Antoine Brie</b> <br>  Recalling the repeated collaboration between Samsung and the Danish company Bang &amp; Olufsen, which specializes in the production of hi-end audio and video equipment, the French designer Antoine Brier presented how the flagship smartphone Galaxy S II could look like in the B &amp; O version. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bac/5d1/979/bac5d1979f77829ea8bba7814103a013.png"><br><br>  According to Antoine, the standard branded stuffing that includes a dual-core processor, 4.3-inch Super AMOLED Plus display and Android platform, B &amp; O experts would have concluded in a very stylish curved body, not forgetting to add to this 64 GB of internal memory and better sound system made by the company's proprietary technology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/957/ea1/46f/957ea146f2109ebef2f2e03ed51d5cd5.png"><br><br>  The kit would also include a Bang &amp; Olufsen docking station with an interface connector and a fairly large brand speaker.  It is worth noting that such a concept is not too far from reality, and, perhaps, someday both companies will be able to launch a similar image product, but on even more powerful platforms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ff8/86e/99c/ff886e99cfd3da7e09d030380aa930bd.png"><br>  <b>Game console Consolor HD3 from Joseph Damery</b> <br>  In the eighth place of our hit parade - that, with a good set of circumstances, can be realized in the foreseeable future.  Despite the fact that while two companies with their own closed systems are reigning in the field of portable game consoles, the role of Android, as a powerful and universal gaming platform, is growing day by day.  This is exactly what young French designer Joseph Damery made a bet on by presenting a very realistic concept for the Samsung Consolor HD3 gaming console. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7f5/cfb/5da/7f5cfb5daa573b953c8da953303420b6.png"><br><br>  In addition to the aforementioned platform, the main advantages of the portable console are the AMOLED multi-touch display, whose resolution is 1920x1080 pixels, an advanced controller system, and a fingerprint identification system, which is provided here, rather than protecting data in the device, but for easy authorization if there are several user profiles.  To further diversify the choice of control in games, the console is equipped with a full set of sensors, including an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and an 8 megapixel front camera.  On the back, the author also ‚Äúinstalled‚Äù the camera, but here it is used for its intended purpose.  The camera allows you to take photos and videos in 3D-format, and its resolution is 12 megapixels.  For network-based multi-player games, as well as for broadcasting various content, the conceptual device has support for WiMAX, Bluetooth 2.1 and DLNA wireless standards.  Well, in order for a large collection of games to fit in the device, according to the author, the device must have a built-in memory of 256 GB. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/623/164/d46/623164d462ce0a1424c036a148a7ab95.png"><br>  <b>Cylindrical printer of the future from the National University of Seoul</b> <br>  We included this device in our review for an unusual approach to ordinary things.  Scientists from the National University of Seoul, together with Samsung engineers, thought about how to make a laser printer as compact as possible while maintaining the ability to print on standard A4 sheets?  The result of their collaboration was this printer, a rather unexpected cylindrical shape, designed for both mobile use and to work in conditions of lack of free space. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7b9/aab/ec6/7b9aabec6928f9c85a4f749a9dc77b11.png"><br><br>  Of course, one could find other technological methods and design solutions in order to achieve a compact printing device.  However, we believe that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa cylindrical printer is brilliant and beautiful in its simplicity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/894/0b5/d07/8940b5d0754227eb3c622862be85f7bb.png"><br>  <b>Proxima Telephone Watch by Johan Lokito</b> <br>  Apparently, not once having lost his own phone, the designer Johan Lokito came up with the concept of a Samsung Proxima mobile device, designed specifically for inattentive and forgetful users.  However, this phone is interesting not only for its purpose, but also for a rather non-trivial design. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f38/bbf/5ba/f38bbf5baad959555e05307ddc8a86bb.png"><br><br>  For ease of use, Johan divided the conceptual device into two components: the phone itself and the wristband holder.  The phone is made in a clamshell form factor and is controlled by three touch screens: in the clock mode, the screen is on electronic ink, and in the unfolded state - two OLED touch screens. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e7c/dc4/8c7/e7cdc48c7517c19d5fd06fa20792113b.png"><br><br>  Bracelet holder in addition to its main purpose can be used to search for the phone.  The latter is in constant communication with the bracelet over a wireless protocol, and if the device loses this connection, the user receives an alert in the form of an audible signal or vibration.  Well, especially inattentive users can run a forced tube search. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/21c/544/da0/21c544da01e918bcb43037b69750a841.png"><br>  <b>Hybrid tablet and desk lamp Waview from Nari Lee</b> <br>  Exactly in the middle of our rating is a bright, in the direct and figurative sense of the word, the concept of a home tablet Waview. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/55e/04b/1b3/55e04b1b3f13c404fe112693ce413827.png"><br><br>  The tablet itself is a flexible device with a transparent screen, which seems to work on the Android platform.  But the most interesting thing is not in the tablet itself, but in what happens if you connect this device to the attached docking station. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6a3/4c5/b0d/6a34c5b0d0850c37bc2e8e5e01bb5a41.png"><br><br>  And you get an interactive table lamp, from which you can manage your library or, for example, a TV and home theater.  Perhaps the usability of such a device may seem doubtful, but its originality undoubtedly deserves respect. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6a4/632/e49/6a4632e4988c5ac3ca1392d3f0955227.png"><br>  <b>Interchangeable Samsung MSTV TV by Joseph Dewmary</b> <br>  Nowadays, televisions are no longer just televisions, becoming powerful, multifunctional home entertainment centers.  However, they all have one drawback - they are supplied as a ready-made solution that does not allow customers to assemble the system for their needs and requirements.  This deficiency was solved by Joseph Dewmary, presenting the concept of a television set consisting of two separate parts: a docking station and a screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dd4/c82/e05/dd4c82e0513c031c3475229244d6abfd.png"><br><br>  Although the designer himself ‚Äúprovided‚Äù the device with quite specific characteristics (Android platform, transparent displays with a resolution of 4096x2160 pixels, support for autostereoscopic 3D), this concept has much wider application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/942/102/13c/94210213c05135547395982374af1312.png"><br><br>  It is enough to expand the range of offered docking stations (from simple low-cost to powerful multimedia solutions with multi-core processors), as well as the types and sizes of screens, and every customer, whether he is an avid film fan or a fan of playing the console, will be able to assemble his own perfect TV. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eaf/92c/99d/eaf92c99d1bad5ebabd0e2eea7d9a1e5.png"><br>  <b>Galaxy Skin Smart smartphone by Heyon Yu</b> <br>  In third place is the concept, and perhaps the prototype of the device, which, in theory, the creators should mark a new milestone in the evolution of smartphones, which are ‚Äúsmart‚Äù devices with a flexible body.  The fact that this is not just the freestyle work of designer Heyon Yu, but the official order of Samung, only confirms the active work of the company in this direction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f99/dbd/b20/f99dbdb20ef7ccc2a34a927f262d61c9.png"><br><br>  The concept is based on the flexible SuperAMOLED screen and the Android platform specially optimized for it, called Flexie.  As conceived by Heyon Yu, the design flexibility primarily serves the ease of use and functionality of the device, rather than being just a ‚Äúwow factor‚Äù.  One or another function is associated with each body position. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e65/128/ac3/e65128ac31ad5b200e4f34899106df07.png"><br><br>  For example, in the folded state - this is just an ordinary thin smartphone "clamshell", but if you put it in on the table in the form of a tent, then you get a video conferencing device.  It is enough to turn the device sideways, slightly bending its sides, in order to activate the widescreen multimedia player, and if you bend it in the middle, the table clock will turn on.  But perhaps the main advantage of the flexible case will be the ability to use the smartphone as an interactive bracelet assistant.  Just like in science fiction films about the future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/827/8ed/4cb/8278ed4cbe5d9b558d71a3d1af362a99.png"><br>  <b>Air Hotel Aircruise by SeymourPowell</b> <br>  Cruise airliner, air hotel, giant airship ... Aircruise concept from the design bureau SeymourPowell from London, in the development of which one of the Samsung divisions took part, can be called anything.  It is important that we face a fundamentally new type of aircraft / building of the future, skillfully combining movable and immovable.  Aircruise is a living room with no address and borders, which allows you to start your day with skiing in the Alps, and just a few hours to dine on the Cote d'Azur in Nice, and all this without leaving the same hotel.  A pleasant addition will be a fascinating and romantic air trip at an altitude of 3600 meters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/125/506/a60/125506a60d29f6580842e12cd04dea28.png"><br><br>  It is assumed that this air liner will be lifted by huge hydrogen cylinders inside the 265 meter hull, and it will move (at a speed of 145 km / h) at the expense of fuel cell engines.  In the flying Hotel Aircruise with a capacity of up to 100 people, there will be several hotel rooms, bars, and viewing platforms. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/bP15Vgt55Gk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgCHrKNvtDEMxo-RWhBdFnMNPkRdw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  On the one hand, this aircraft opens up a fundamentally new type of cruise vacation, and on the other hand, if, say, abandoning engines, is a promising project of stationary hotels of the future, especially in conditions where every square meter of land is worth its weight in gold. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d3a/c18/e6d/d3ac18e6dc216b13c5d850d9b2bd41ac.png"><br>  <b>Flexible Tablet with Samsung Transparent Clear AMOLED Display</b> <br>  Of course, you can blame us for bias for putting Samsung‚Äôs own development on top of our rating.  But we hasten to reassure you. The flexible AMOLED tablet with a transparent display won the first place only because of its realism ... <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/f4AhTiQkWwk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhOl8aq2r9g-ENfALkRW3DpTx5qaA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Yes, you understood correctly, realism.  After all, if you think about (and do not take to heart the "conventional" appearance of the concept), then there is nothing unusual in the presented technologies: flexible AMOLED displays were presented several years ago, and transparent ones are already <a href="http://www.samsung.com/ru/news/presskitList.do%3Fpage%3D2%26news_seq%3D%26rdoPeriod%3DALL%26from_dt%3D%26to_dt%3D%26news_group%3DALL%26news_type%3D%26news_ctgry%3D%26search_keyword%3D">commercially</a> available, and multimedia technologies like 3D, augmented reality or automatic simultaneous translation is no surprise.  It remains to collect all this together, into one innovative device, which, perhaps, will once again turn the world of content and interactive services, and at the same time with it the market of mobile devices.  And we are sure that it will not pass even several years, as something like this will come to life under the Samsung brand.  It remains only to wait ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137565/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137565/</a></p>
