If you do not care for the plants, they will either die or will not be able to please the owner with their appearance or fruits.  And it turns out to take care not always - because many of us have to periodically leave. <br><br>  In addition, the routine work (and work with the land is almost always a routine) is not everyone likes.  What to do?  There is an excellent solution that allows you to solve two problems at once - caring for the site in the absence of a person and solving the issue of routine.  This solution is technology.  Now on the market - a lot of smart solutions, systems that will tell the owner in detail about the condition of the soil, plants, weather conditions.  They will be able to water the plant or protect it from adverse weather conditions.  What does the market offer today?  Let's find out. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Grove </h3>

What to do?  Arrange a couple of beds at home.  Moreover, these beds can be combined with an aquarium. <br><br>  We are talking about the so-called ‚Äúaqua system‚Äù, which is distinguished from the hydroponic one by the presence of an aquarium with fish and everything that should be in the aquarium.  The system is a hybrid - fish produce nitrogen-rich waste, and plants on the "top floor" receive this waste and grow. <br><br>  True, the fish get almost nothing from the plants.  But it is nothing.  since the owner regularly feeds his waterfowl pets.  On the top two tiers you can grow vegetables, lettuce, young onions and all the other tasty (and very useful) things. <br><br>  That's just the cost of such a system is $ 4,200.  This is perhaps the only negative. <br><br><h3>  Smart garden sensor Edyn </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a48/66d/008/a4866d00891fef231e64d592d3d3ba83.jpg"><br><br>  This device will always tell its owner about soil moisture, pH, temperature, light level, nutrients and plant moisture levels desirable for plants.  All data collected by the device is then sent to the partner application on the mobile device of the owner. <br><br>  Energy for Edyn supplies the Sun - the device is equipped with solar panels.  The system database contains about 5,000 plant species.  About each of them Edyn knows a lot, you can look at this data in the application.  The only condition for Edyn to work is the availability of a Wi-Fi network. <br><br><h3>  Autoleigh </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a71/848/1e9/a718481e94144a16be1767d2f407fd15.JPG"><br><br>  This is a small system of automatic watering, which can independently take care of home (or office plants) in your absence.  "Autoleigh" automatically determines the amount of water and irrigation time, providing the best mode for plants. <br><br>  If you leave for a long period or your plants need a more accurate dosage of water - the kit includes special droppers dispensers that turn the Auto-Lane into a micro-drop irrigation system.  The timer includes a pump that piped up the water.  Using the buttons on the panel, you can adjust the frequency of watering from <br>  10 times a day to 1 time per month.  The amount of water can be adjusted by the duration of watering.  By the way, on Geektimes already <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dadget/blog/268466/">wrote about this system</a> . <br><br>  The cost of the <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/dom-i-dacha/avtoleika/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Davtoleika%26utm_content%3Davtoleika%26utm_campaign%3Davtoleika_249">system is 3500 rubles</a> .  If you wish, you can get a 10% discount on the GEEKT-SAD code. <br><br><h3>  Biopod </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b7e/4e3/b18/b7e4e3b18837a87bc2dce12f4af39f8f.jpg"><br><br>  Another project dedicated to the creation of an artificial ecosystem.  Biopod is an autonomous closed system capable of growing and developing on its own.  Here, temperature, light, humidity, ventilation and precipitation are automatically controlled.  From the owner you need only one thing - admiring and admiring the system. <br><br>  The cost of a Biopod is much less than the price of an aqua system - only $ 225.  Compared to $ 4,000 + it's just a gift. <br><br><h3>  Robomow RS630 </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6e3/7a4/380/6e37a4380139f6c9d9a8e28e444e6ac5.jpg"><br><br>  But enough of us artificial ecosystems placed in a confined space.  If you have a garden or lawn, then you know what it is - the obligation to level the grass cover and keep it in good condition.  At this time there is not always, especially in a busy geek. <br><br>  Therefore, the Robomow RS630 robotic lawnmower comes to the rescue.  In standalone mode, it can cut the grass on about an acre.  The device is equipped with anti-theft system and a security system for children. <br><br>  If it starts to rain, the Robomow RS630 hides under a canopy - it has a special sensor.  You can manage the device using a mobile application. <br><br>  The cost of this joy - 2499 pounds.  A lot. <br><br><h3>  Rachio </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a09/dc1/f57/a09dc1f57d2a4050e4c6ee2b6842e05c.jpg"><br><br>  And this is a smart watering system that is controlled from a smartphone.  According to the developers, Rachio reduces water consumption by about 50%, which is very sensitive in countries with high water tariffs. <br><br>  Rachio independently decides when it is necessary to water the land - for this the system uses the data of the weather forecast, humidity sensors and other modules. <br><br>  Rachio for sale at a price of $ 200.  Not so expensive if this watering system is really capable of that.  what the developers are talking about. <br><br>  The cost of Rachio is $ 200. <br><br>
<h3>  Country SMS-alarm </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/21f/b53/d9e/21fb53d9e9f872f60cf4cf88d4bde2e4.jpg"><br><br>  If you have a cottage with a house, consider yourself lucky.  There is, where to relax after a busy day, retire and relax.  True, the house can be a problem, since in the absence of the owner there can be thieves. <br><br>  In order not to worry about this problem, you should use the system "Country SMS-alarm).  She will warn in time if someone climbed into the house, and not only.  The alarm will also take a picture of the attacker. <br><br>  The owner receives a notification on his mobile phone (in total, you can set 6 numbers to which notifications will be sent). <br><br>  The cost of the device <a href="https://dadget.ru/gsm-alarm/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Dgsm-alarm%26utm_content%3Dgsm-alarm%26utm_campaign%3Dgsm-alarm_249">is 9990 rubles</a> .

In addition, the device says how much water to use for irrigation and how to water your plants.  The sensor also helps to reduce water consumption and reduces water bills. <br><br>  Among other things, GreenIQ Smart Garden is compatible with the IFTTT automation service, so the range of possible actions here is quite wide. <br><br>  You can buy such a system for ¬£ 190. <br><br><h3>  Plantui 6 </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c99/012/0c9/c990120c9c5ae7ab09106663b9729285.jpg"><br><br>  And here is the smallest hydroponic system of all presented.  It literally fits on the table.  Plantui is like a toy, but in fact, it is quite an adult system with the original idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe developers.  Namely - you need to grow a plant of a certain size, observing all the conditions recommended by the system.  This is something like a game, in which a prize, for example, is a salad, mint or tomatoes. <br><br>  Price issue - ¬£ 195. <br><br><h3>  Antikrot </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cd0/1ad/254/cd01ad254cd617b82e6900bb444e43c9.jpg" height="300" width="600"><br><br>  Such systems have already become the standard for dacha .. Antikrot does not harm anyone around, but creates intolerable living conditions for underground rodents.  This electronic device with a battery, constantly making clicking sounds, which are well transmitted underground and irritate the moles, cause them a state of stress.  Animals do not maintain, and leave from a site where such system is established. <br><br>  Enough for an area of ‚Äã‚Äãup to 10 acres.  If the protected area is larger, you will need several "Antikrots". <br><br>  It is sealed, made of impact-resistant plastic.  The battery is easy to replace.  Safe for people and pets. <br><br>  Cost of the <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/dom-i-dacha/antikrot/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Dantikrot%26utm_content%3Dantikrot%26utm_campaign%3Dantikrot_249">device - 1150 p</a> .  Here it is also possible to receive a 10% discount on the GEEKT-SAD code. <br><br>  <b>As a conclusion: there</b> are a lot of various decisions of this kind for a house, a summer residence and a site.  We have shown only a fraction of the systems that are present in the market.  We hope that all this will help you work and relax comfortably, without any problems. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395355/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395355/</a></p>
