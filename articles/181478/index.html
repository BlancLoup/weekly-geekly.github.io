  <section class="page js-page"><h1>There is a set of future leaders of Computer Science in AU and CSC</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The article focuses on two educational institutions in St. Petersburg, where students are now ( <b>but soon coming to an end</b> ).  Despite the fact that admission takes place on a competitive basis, and not everyone who desires enters, I thought that many readers of this blog may not be just students, but intelligent and purposeful students, so there is a decent chance that they will act.  So if you are interested in getting a high-quality education in the field of computer science, which will allow you not only to develop software in the best IT companies, but also to engage in research activities (if there is a desire) - read to the end. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  JetBrains has been supporting projects that popularize science and education among young people for over a decade.  Naturally, JetBrains is focused on the science that is closest to software development, i.e.  on computer science.  We believe that students and graduates should be able to study advanced disciplines where it is more convenient for them and at a time when it is more convenient for them.

      Therefore, we support two different training formats - day and evening.  Depending on what kind of education a person has and how much time he is ready to allocate for training, you can enter the Computer Science Center or the Academic University. <br><br>  <b>Computer Science Center</b> offers a free 2- or 3-year program of full-time evening classes on the most important computer science disciplines for people with any education.  Admission - at the competition once a year, acceptance of applications this year <b>ends on June 9</b> .  Hurry up!  Details - paragraph below. <br><br>  <b>Academic University</b> accepts those who have already received a bachelor degree and wants to continue their education.  It is the only university that is an institution of the Russian Academy of Sciences.  The Department of Mathematical and Information Technologies offers a 2-year full-time full-time course in the master's program.  Specializations of the department: theoretical informatics, software development, algorithmic bioinformatics.  You can enter the department to get a second master‚Äôs degree.  Admission - by competition, this year <b>you need to have time to submit an application before the end of June</b> , the next set - only in spring 2014. The department receives students not only from St. Petersburg, but also from other cities. <br><br><h4>  Details: How Computer Science Center Works </h4><br>  Students studying at the Computer Science Center (CSC) are required to study a minimum set of subjects, such as algorithms and data structures, basic mathematics, programming languages ‚Äã‚Äã(C ++, Java), databases.  The remaining courses, students choose their own.  The list of courses is impressive, here is just an example of some courses of the last spring semester: <br><br><ul><li>  Algorithms in bioinformatics </li><li>  Additional chapters of algorithms </li><li>  Mathematical statistics </li><li>  Parallel programming </li><li>  Distributed data storage and processing systems </li><li>  The complexity of computing and the basics of cryptography </li><li>  Modern software development technologies </li><li>  Game theory </li><li>  Storage and processing technologies for large amounts of data </li><li>  Functional programming </li></ul><br><br>  CSC teachers - employees of the best universities of St. Petersburg, as well as specialists from leading IT companies, this sets the bar high for the quality of courses.  An important component of training are course projects, which, as a rule, are carried out under the guidance of specialists from IT companies.  In addition, students are offered summer practices in which they get the opportunity to work in a company where there are many tasks and you can find a job for the soul. <br><br><h4>  Or maybe enough online education? </h4><br>  All CSC lectures are laid out in the <a href="http://www.lektorium.tv/">video storage Lektorium</a> .  At the same time, the video recordings of lectures are kept in open access and anyone can start learning at any time.  However, everyone understands that personal communication with teachers and fellow students cannot be mechanically replaced by watching a video.  In addition, there are no practical components in video lectures: you cannot take homework and do coursework projects.  So, to get all the benefits of studying at CSC, you still have to enroll in it. <br><br>  More information about entering the Computer Science Center is available on the <a href="http://compscicenter.ru/admission">website of the center</a> . <br><br><h4>  What is the Academic University? </h4><br>  Academic University is designed for those who have already received a bachelor's degree or specialist.  For them, training is free. <br><br>  Duration of training - two years, full-time, full-time study.  Upon completion of training, students receive a master's degree. <br><br>  JetBrains helps students of the department of mathematical and information technologies throughout their study.  Our employees take part in interviews of applicants, read special courses, and lead practical work.  Between the 5th and 6th year students of the department have the opportunity to complete a 1-2 month internship at JetBrains, and if successful, stay with us.  We provide topics and executives for master's theses.  Successful students are paid an additional scholarship. <br><br>  JetBrains traditionally oversees the specialization "Software Development".  It offers courses on software development technologies, object-oriented programming, databases, data analysis, development of language processors, etc. As in CSC, much attention is paid to practice: one day a week is devoted to working on practical projects under the guidance of specialists from IT companies (including JetBrains). <br><br>  More information about admission to the Academic University is described on <a href="http://mit.spbau.ru/admission">the University website</a> . <br><br>  Ask questions in the comments - I will be happy to answer or call colleagues from the AU or CSC for an answer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/181478/">https://habr.com/ru/post/181478/</a></p>
