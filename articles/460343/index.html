My name is Maxim Gazizov.  Earlier, I published a <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/412805/">post</a> on Habr√© about my successes and mistakes in game devs.  And then, after a year of working on my brainchild called Wasteland Wars, I disappeared from the air.  All because I was so delayed the process as never before.  By the way, it happened that I lost my previous account and created a new one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dy/f_/lt/dyf_ltfxayhev6zuhrjvr4wq3zg.jpeg" alt="Wasteland wars"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Life to own project </h2><br>  I used to develop mobile applications, VR projects and high-load systems.  Today I fully devote myself to developing my game.  The fact is that I approach <a href="http://telega.at/WastelandWarsBot">Wasteland Wars</a> not as a product, but as a large community of players and a favorite business. <br><br>  Let me remind you that I am developing not a single runner for iOS, not a shooter, but a multiplayer game on the Telegram platform.  And, of course, depending on the subject matter and specifics of the platform, its own nuances have arisen, arise and will emerge.

      When I was developing single-player games, I, as they say, had norms: I wrote a game, put it on the App Store, went through moderation, bought advertising ‚Äî that's it, go download and purchase;  then you simply verify incomes, allocate funds and live the life of a ‚Äúgenius director‚Äù.  However, everything once comes to an end, and sometimes it is peculiar to change. <br><br><h2>  What made me reconsider my priorities </h2><br>  Today the situation looks very different.  In short, I am fully integrated into the process of developing and supporting the game at the backend level.  When I wake up and go to Telegram, I see data streams in my auxiliary bots, channels and backend chat rooms of the game: game bot reports, raid reports, daily online purchases and other player actions. <br><br>  I am already silent about the PM and game chat rooms - there is always a life of its own.  People of different professions, backgrounds and hobbies walk around the virtual Wasteland, pump their skills, explore locations, participate in events and get bans for Tweaks.  And all this I see both on my phone and tablet, and on a computer. <br><br>  If some kind of adok happens, I climb it to fix it.  Yes, I myself climb to fix it, because I do not have a development team.  Still, I adhere to the principle ‚Äúif you want to do well, do it yourself‚Äù.  In my very first article on Habr√©, I told you exactly what kind of trouble occurred.  Let's go back to them, here they are: <br><br><ul><li>  unstable servers; </li><li>  Telegram lock. </li></ul><br>  These two situations turned out to be solved and circumvented.  In the first case, I simply invested in the comfort of the players, and in the second situation I had to make war.  As a result, as we know, Telegram is still working regardless of the actions of the RKN.  So, in essence, the second situation was resolved both by itself and by the efforts of enthusiastic players (for which many thanks to these guys). <br><br>  Then, of course, added to the difficulty of entering the game from the beginners, but they also managed to overcome.  Probably the most unpleasant story that happens from time to time is the fall of raids.  A couple of times it was, but still not cool, when on the other side of the screens hundreds of people decided to go to the raid, but it does not work.  Because of this, I get into the processes myself and correct errors. <br><br>  I did not answer the main question - why is it happening that I am being pushed from the tablet in the Swift (lol, in the Swallow) and being near my brainchild.  The answer is as simple as possible: there is a game that people like, and there are people who enjoy playing it.  Consequently, the grocery part, which is mainly the interest of the uncles in the costumes called ‚Äústakeholders‚Äù, is at 754 place in the priorities. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt have a lot of commercial directors behind me, and the Wasteland Wars stakeholders are the players themselves.  And today my goal is to provide the community of players with the opportunity to have fun and have fun from anywhere in the world.  I'm glad I took the side of the user, not the economy.  Today, Wasteland Wars is more than a game to me. <br><br><h2>  Recent updates </h2><br>  The game has gone through several global updates.  Today, it works on patch 2.2b, which was successfully unloaded and pip-batted players.  In this latest update, I implemented a few interesting things that were asking for the game so long ago: <br><br><ul><li>  he added the mechanics of gangs, but groups of players (a la "party" in popular online games) are called a little differently; </li><li>  launched the referral system bonus - the link owner now receives a part of the pups from each purchase of his referrals who were invited after this update; </li><li>  added Xsolla payment system for players from other countries; </li><li>  I worked a lot on the UI and fixed it so that the gameplay looked much nicer, and was perceived easier; </li><li>  while the player is moving from location to location, there is a moment with waiting.  Now in the process there were tips that will brighten this process and give a couple of ideas to the player; </li><li>  Before attacking an opponent, you can check his avatar; </li><li>  corrected raids, made a focus on the gangs and screwed a separate raid mode for self-activation on the roadsides; </li><li>  trophies gained in combat now affect the faction rating. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ws/a5/np/wsa5npc8rewtjaa0r1y1k6lymiq.jpeg" alt="Wasteland Wars Player Avatar"><br>  <i>View avatar of player profile before attacking</i> <br><br><h2>  What is what will be </h2><br>  A year ago, I thought that it would be cool to untie a game from Telegram and make a client on several platforms.  Today there is no need for this yet.  The actions of the ILV are similar to testing hypotheses in terms of blocking: they get something, something doesn't.  Therefore, now the game quietly exists on the platform in Telegram.  However, there is everything to carry, I am prepared. <br><br>  Most of all I dream to make the game self-sufficient and give the development of the game world into the hands of players.  I would like the players to have fun on their own script, rather than laid down in the scripts.  I am working on it now. <br><br>  In my game there is monetization, for which I often catch a hate.  I want to explain why I need this monetization and how approximately it looks.  If we talk about monetization in detail, this is a topic entirely for another hub and for a separate article, but I will try.  Monetization works like this: all game items can be obtained without donation, it will just be a little longer, but more interesting. <br><br>  People often ask me if game devils live well.  In turn, I am not ready to say that today you are putting an online game on stream, and tomorrow it will give you money for donations and you will become a millionaire.  Gamedev lives well in the case when it is interesting for him to develop his creation, and not to consider him as a bubble extractor from the point of view of the product. <br><br>  And no, I did not become a millionaire for this year, because I spend donations on the development of the game.  The paradox, of course - I want the players to be comfortable, but in the end I get a hate in response.  Strange, but all people are different, and our expectations tend not to come true. <br><br>  <i>If you are going to make an online game, think it over as it should.</i>  <i>As I said, the MMORPG is not a story about a fast path to enrichment, but hundreds and thousands of hours of code, testing, and all sorts of debugging.</i>  <i>And if you are ready and understand all the difficulties on your way, then go ahead!</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/460343/">https://habr.com/ru/post/460343/</a></p>
