There was a logical desire to repeat success.  Ok, we do similar application and we turn the same marketing manipulations.  We look what happened.

We got to the 6th place in our category in the AppStore, but there was an unpleasant thing with GooglePlay ... <br><br>  We have never appeared anywhere in the GooglePlay catalog, either in new products or in the top of its category at least at the bottom, i.e.  the game could only be found through a search or a direct link.  And the games that came out later with 5-10 installations were new, and we with thousands of players didn‚Äôt ... At first I decided that maybe Google needed time to index the application.  But a week has passed, two months, we have already squandered the entire budget, but the catalog has not surfaced.  At this point, it was already decided to restart the game, because  The situation is clearly not healthy, but it was still not clear what happened and why we flew past the directory. <br><br>  And then the developer of the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Daltergames.intellect_battle">Intellect-battlle</a> application wrote to me, saying that they had exactly the same situation - they started the game, caught up with a bit of traffic, but never appeared.  In the support, both they and us were answered roughly the same way: ‚Äúguys, formally getting into the catalog and top categories is not guaranteed, technically everything is OK, try your best‚Äù.  As a result, agreed on the assumption that the root of the problem lies in the haggling of the name - we have ‚ÄúRemember the Movie‚Äù, they have some variation with the word ‚ÄúMillionaire‚Äù, and in the market there are hundreds of ‚Äúfilms‚Äù and ‚Äúmillionaires‚Äù, respectively, Google ignored.  This is not accurate, but the most working hypothesis.  In general, we renamed our games, started a new Bundle ID, restarted, and literally in 24 hours appeared wherever it was expected.  I hope someone reads this story, edits its unnecessarily ‚ÄúSEO‚Äù name before launch and does not step on our rake <br><br>  Another obvious reason for failure is trite, the game is not so good as to crack the word of mouth and shake the algorithms of recommendations of the stores.  This is just a sturdy quiz game.  Yes, with a unique feature in the form of audio tips, but for a potential player it looks like ‚Äúanother quiz about the movie‚Äù.  Moreover, we have something to compare - if you look at the dynamics of the <a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/anvilgames/blog/22278/">previous launch</a> , you can see that the same channels, for example, macdigger.ru, w3bsit3-dns.com, the public of ‚ÄúLepre‚Äù generated 1.5 times less installations this time.  That is, less people became interested in advertising, and then from those who are interested, a smaller percentage actually got involved in the game. <br><br>  Well, the strategic plan failed, it happens, but then we have the results of working with two channels of promotion. <br><br><h3>  VK groups </h3><br>  <b>Pros:</b> cheap, live players, easy to scale, almost no moderation, easy to target <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">more ... ‚Ü¥</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  - You can pick up suitable thematic communities, but it seemed to me that it would be more efficient to find game lovers, and not fans of the setting. <br>  - For comparison, motivated traffic can be found at about the same price of 10-20 rubles, but these will be ‚Äúdead souls‚Äù, suitable only for manipulating the ranking in the tops (even in the responses, schoolchildren will spoil if there are problems on the supplier‚Äôs side ‚ÄúMotive‚Äù), and here you get really live players <br>  - In the pictures: the ratio of New Users and DAU when using the motive - <a href="">puu.sh/nTeiy/a5862a5c39.png</a> and from posts in the social network - <a href="">puu.sh/nTemx/e084b76c4d.png;</a>  it is evident that after boost motivated installations DAU immediately slipped to its previous value <br>  - If you believe iTunesConnect, 50% following the link from the advertising post, installed the game.  Given that, on average, we only have 25% of those who visited the game page, they are converted into installed ones. </div></div><br>  <b>Minuses: the</b> post hangs only 1 hour, then it is lost, it is a lot of bots, it is difficult to estimate the percentage of the live audience, the fads of the admins <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">more ... ‚Ü¥</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  - 24 hours after publication, the post is usually deleted, but not always;  although there will be no sense anyway from him; <br>  - You need to contact community administrators and negotiate with everyone individually, and they all have their own cockroaches and troubles - someone only works with WebMoney, someone only works with Yandex.Money, some people have no repost-posts from other communities ( for example, groups of the game), others do not have ‚Äúproposed news‚Äù, etc.  One admin with whom I had to work, forgot to publish the post at the appointed time, although the deferred publication is set up in 5 seconds, moved to another day as a result.  But in general, this is not all deadly and quickly get used to these whims <br>  - If you post posts through the official stock exchange, then, in addition to the mark-up, you will have to deal with strict moderation of advertising content, while working directly you only need to take into account the admin‚Äôs wishes <br>  - Pricing is not always clear, it is difficult to estimate the number of dead souls among public subscribers, there are tools for searching and analyzing, for example <a href="http://sociate.ru/">sociate.ru</a> , <a href="http://vkool.ru/">vkool.ru</a> or the <a href="https://vk.com/exchange%3Fact%3Dcommunity_search%26sort%3Dreach">official VK exchange</a> - you can spend the whole campaign through them for a tangible%, but you can use for evaluation and search, and then manually write to the leaders of each community <br>  - Advertising posts are gaining an average of 10 times less likes and reposts, compared with the usual community content.  It may make sense to change the content of the post, taking into account the specifics of each individual public, flirt with the auditor, experiment with hidden advertising, etc. <br></div></div><br><h3>  Reviews on sites </h3><br>  <b>Pros:</b> indexing by search engines, reviews do not disappear anywhere, you can agree for free <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">more ... ‚Ü¥</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  - Generally speaking, any benefit from indexing by search engines is not proven.  There was an assumption that this affects the ranking in the tops, but it seems to be from the category of marketing mythology <br>  - Often, you can reset the price by half if you write the review text yourself, and in some cases you can count on free posting - if the editor liked your application or if you wrote a valid dev-story, for example </div></div><br>  <b>Cons:</b> expensive, not very efficient, bad text found, endangered format as a whole <br><br>  In principle, I was pleased with the reviews on macdigger.ru and w3bsit3-dns.com.ru - a good return for my money, and extremely discouraged by the results of publications on the resources of the i10 group (Planet iPhone and AndroidInsider) - high prices, mediocre text, no exhaust.  The rest of the minor reviews are also a waste of money, apparently, but at least the amounts there are not so exaggerated. <br><br>  I am sure there are publications with a large lively audience, enjoying great prestige among the readers, but it is hardly possible to come to them with a little unknown mobile game.  By the way, the publication on <a href="https://tech.onliner.by/">tech.onliner.by</a> can ensure that you get into the Top Overall AppStore in Belarus, checked. <br><br><h3>  Current state of affairs </h3><br>  After the restart and termination of marketing activity, the installation did not fall to zero, but where did the traffic come from?  There are two options: ‚Äútail‚Äù from publications + search traffic or cross-promo from the first game.  Ok, let's compare the number of daily application settings (dark line) with the number of cross-promo links (light line): <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dbd/ed4/530/dbded45300c54c6991b0a4df80e8f838.png"></div><br>  The correlation of one with the other is obvious, so now the second application lives almost exclusively due to cross-promo from the first, and the tail from marketing, the catalog, the search - all this is in front of the error.  Approximately 15% of all players of the first application follow a cross-promo link, and only ~ 23% of the applications that have moved to the page eventually install it.  Total 0.15 * 0.23 * 100 = 4%, we expected a large conversion, of course. <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  Yes, it was not possible to repeat the previous success, but we received answers to some questions and a lot of experience, which means the next attempt will be more effective.  I hope some readers will also benefit from this experience. <br><br>  Next bold (and someone will say "recklessly risky" ... and be right!) Experiments with YouTube and the bloggers living on it.  If all this is interesting to you, we will definitely share our experience and our own impressions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299564/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299564/</a></p>
