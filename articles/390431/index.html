This, of course, is about <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/projectors/epson-eh-tw5200/">Epson EH-TW5200</a> , the appearance of which was a significant event in the world of home projectors <i>(we modestly declare)</i> . <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/pszLB7wgvoI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjRVoQMMNr4ltC_dd6ArMfeZ8DSng" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  And now, the Epson line of entry-level projectors has been completely updated - the honorable place of the predecessor was taken at once by three models - <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/projectors/epson-eh-tw5210/">Epson EH-TW5210</a> , <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/projectors/epson-eh-tw5300/">Epson EH-TW5300</a> and <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/projectors/epson-eh-tw5350/">Epson EH-TW5350</a> .  In this publication, based on our own comparative testing and with the help <a href="http://myprojector.ru/">of the MyProjector.ru team of specialists</a> , we will show what exactly the new projectors are better at, well, we will tell in general about them.  And at the same time we remind readers of what one can expect from a modern home projector. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h2>  To new heights </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a14/193/27d/a1419327d6a147638d269ae3a44c8bfc.jpg"></div><br>  New projectors are conceived as a further development of Epson EH-TW5200.  Our testing confirmed the presence of improvements in a number of parameters.  In this case, for example, Epson EH-TW5210 has also become cheaper than its predecessor!  However, the main purpose of the devices has not changed.  Like its predecessor, the new models are bright home projectors whose potential is fully revealed when working in ordinary rooms, such as living rooms or living rooms.  In the presence of traditionally high (thanks to technology 3LCD) <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/epson/blog/222115/">color brightness</a> , which allows you to project a bright picture with rich colors in low and medium light. <br><br><h2>  We are testing! </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d65/fac/47e/d65fac47e7a84146bd3b0f72328d5ec7.jpg"></div><br>  As Boris "get the fuck out" believes that <a href="https://youtu.be/fgNJ1034kIc%3Ft%3D6s">gravity is good</a> , we believe that the margin of brightness is good.  When testing in the office, the importance of a good brightness margin is exceptionally well marked.  Even the light that seeps through the closed blinds may be enough to require additional brightness.  In addition, practice shows that when the projector gives a high-quality image in the light, in some cases the viewer does not want to turn it off completely, since it is so easy.  If it‚Äôs not about the purposeful viewing of your favorite movie in the dark with popcorn, but about TV, sports or games, then why not? <br><br>  By the way, a consequence of the high color brightness of the 3LCD technology is a gentle load on the lamp.  In new projectors, the brightness in maximum power mode has been <b>increased from 2000 to 2200 lumens</b> .  In the mode of reduced power consumption - from 1400 Lm to 1500 Lm as compared with Epson EH-TW5200, and the estimated resource of the lamp is extended from 6000 to 7500 hours!  This means that in conditions of minimum illumination or lack of it, the margin of brightness of the projector will significantly save on lamp replacement, while obtaining even a brighter picture than with the EH-TW5200. <br><br>  According to the measurement results, the Epson EH-TW5350 actually produced almost 2500 lumens versus 2200 lumens of the Epson EH-TW5200 projector.  In economy mode, in fact, the new projector produces 1600 Lm versus 1500 Lm for Epson EH-TW5200.  Those.  <b>The actual brightness of the projector is even higher than the passport</b> . <br><br><h2>  Home entertainment - 3D </h2><br>  We emphasize once again that the bright modes of our projectors can really be used by getting a high-quality image with bright colors, which is a reason to talk about these projectors as universal devices for home entertainment, allowing you to make a real competition to the TV.  In addition to watching movies and sports programs, the projectors of this series are clearly also focused on games, viewing 3D content in full HD and projecting from mobile devices. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/903/a42/61d/903a4261dab341e7bae0e4d858e221ac.jpg"></div><br>  As for 3D, the Epson EH-TW5200 was positioned from the very beginning as a 3D projector.  Well, since the main problem of 3D devices is insufficient brightness, and Epson EH-TW5200 and its descendants are <b>very bright</b> , we boldly say that they <i>(at the time of writing the post)</i> have no analogues in their price segment in terms of 3D image quality, and the projectors of the new series continue this tradition thanks to even greater brightness. <br><br>  Incidentally, in 3D mode, our devices allow you to choose between bright and accurate color mode.  Not all manufacturers offer this possibility, because, for example, in the case of DLP projectors, two or even threefold loss of brightness in exact mode is aggravated by loss of brightness through 3D glasses!  The guys from MyProjector.ru demonstrated this well <a href="https://youtu.be/pszLB7wgvoI%3Ft%3D2m39s">in one of their video reviews</a> . <br><br><h2>  Projection from Mobile and MIRACAST </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c51/b2a/829/c51b2a8294464773917177e2f0787828.jpg"></div><br>  Projection from mobile devices involves, above all, displaying the screen wiredly via an HDMI MHL wire (that is, one that also recharges the connected device).  The Epson EH-TW5200 projector had optional WiFi support, typical of business projectors (see <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/epson/blog/234529/">Epson projector network functions</a> ).  In the new line, the Epson EH-TW5350 model has the ability to mirror the screen of a mobile device via Miracast / WiDi, while <b>WiFi is built into the projector</b> ! <br><br>  Miracast was tested by us using <a href="http://www.epson.ru/catalog/moverio-bt-200/">Epson Moverio BT-200</a> augmented reality <a href="http://www.epson.ru/catalog/moverio-bt-200/">glasses</a> , which can work both in source mode and in the Miracast signal receiver: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aba/839/b9d/aba839b9da10453394fd298220f565a5.jpg"></div><br>  It should be understood that Miracast is designed for wireless transmission of video signal not in real time and not in super high quality.  Therefore, this standard is not suitable for streaming video at 1080p / 60 Hz.  But it is quite suitable for a wireless demonstration of images and presentations. <br><br><h2>  Games and entertainment </h2><br>  Testing Epson EH-TW5350 in video games, we have devoted almost a whole day.  Due to the high color brightness, the projector produces a more than pleasant looking picture with a different level of illumination, which exhibits modern video games in the best light.  Immersive effect is just great!  We will be happy to demonstrate this to anyone <a href="http://epson.ru/demo/">in one of the Epson demo rooms</a> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a9/a5a/f51/4a9a5af51cda451d8574a59895f1b1f3.jpg"></div><br>  It was game testing that allowed establishing the main advantage from the gamer's point of view of the Epson EH-TW5350 and the new line as a whole compared to the Epson EH-TW5200.  We are talking about <b>reducing the output delay</b> to 26-27 milliseconds (according to our measurements by comparing with a monitor with a known delay) in the "exact" video processing mode. <br><br>  Switching to the ‚Äúfast‚Äù mode, we get an additional decrease in the delay - up to 24-25 ms.  Thus, Epson EH-TW5350, even in the "accurate" mode, is faster than its predecessor in the "fast" mode. <br><br>  Since everything that is less than 30 ms is considered to be a very good indicator, Epson EH-TW5210, EH-TW5300 and EH-TW5350 projectors become more attractive than ever to gamers: here is full HD, and low lag, and good visibility of the picture. <br><br><h2>  Image quality and color accuracy </h2><br>  Comparative testing of image quality yielded decent results.  First of all, compared to its predecessor, the Epson EH-TW5350 has improved color reproduction.  Everything that could be improved without changing the ‚Äúiron‚Äù was improved or at least slightly adjusted. <br><br>  In bright modes, the changes affected mainly the range, which has become more even and ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù, providing good visibility of dark objects in the light.  In exact modes, gamma has become adequate to the tasks - about 2.2 in the "Neutral" mode (all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rec._709">by standards</a> ) and 2.4 in the "Cinema" mode.  Compared with the EH-TW5200, this gives, on the contrary, a more contrast effect.  In general, it is considered correct to use the gamma 2.4 in the dark, 2.2 in low light and 2.0 in the light.  What was done. <br><br>  In the "Neutral" mode, significantly higher accuracy of individual colors has been achieved.  This is especially affected green.  More detailed information can be read on Myprojector.ru, when the team prepares its own review of the projector (add the link to the post). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/495/837/895/4958378959914ea99067906b73af4566.jpg"></div><br>  All this our test device showed "right out of the box", without any additional configuration.  With this level of color accuracy, new projectors are ready to argue with the older model <a href="http://www.epson.ru/catalog/projectors/epson-eh-tw6600/">Epson EH-TW6600</a> as a projector for the living room. <br><br>  Speaking of contrast, we also found some improvement in ANSI contrast while testing side by side with the EH-TW5200 projector.  Although we did not test the contrast for accurate measurement, but in order to simply conclude that there were changes, we note that the ANSI contrast EH-TW5350 even with the aperture turned off in the brightest mode is <b>at least 1.5 times higher</b> (white is brighter and black is darker) than the predecessor. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bbc/48d/d39/bbc48dd394f34e7699492df62a13fbd0.jpg"></div><br>  The automatic aperture has become more obscure the image in dark and almost black scenes, but does this in more rare cases, trying not to obscure bright objects.  You can rely on it mainly on completely dark scenes. <br><br><h2>  Frame interpolation </h2><br>  All new models have a small but pleasant bonus in the form of a function that allows you to create a presence effect by increasing the frame rate of the input material.  In some scenes where there is camera movement, this allows you to remove a noticeable jitter and make the movement smooth. <br><br>  ‚ÄúFrame interpolation‚Äù came from top devices (more <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/epson/blog/252930/">about ‚Äúimage enhancement‚Äù</a> ) and, although on projectors of different price classes its efficiency is different, frame interpolation in Epson EH-TW5350 does its job, better coping with materials encoded in good quality, such like movies in Blu-ray format, really producing a feeling of hyper-realistic smoothness and smoothness of movement.  In general, the supplement is useful, but it should be used sparingly and not on every film.  And it is better for watching sports, TV and games in which FPS is rigidly fixed, for example, at 30 frames per second. <br><br><h2>  Installation </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e5/678/228/5e5678228db74fefbf77a72617de7a8e.jpg"></div><br>  The projection ratio and optical zoom of the new models are not different, so the installation parameters can be calculated using the <a href="http://www.epson.ru/catalog/calc/">Epson projection calculator</a> , choosing the Epson EH-TW5200 model, while the new ones are not listed. <br><br>  In order to allow the user to install the projector on the rear shelf without a ceiling mount, the image of the projector is divided by the lens center in the proportions 10: 1. The optical zoom ratio is 1.2x. <br><br><h2>  Start Screen (Home Screen) </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e3e/a57/7d0/e3ea577d026a415e882b0c7c6f2bef98.jpg"></div><br>  The ‚ÄúHome Screen‚Äù button on the remote and the projector housing displays a simplified menu with a set of the most popular functions: selection of a signal source, setting the image mode and lamp power consumption.  The QR code scanning function (bottom right) is used to quickly connect to the projector from a mobile device via iProjection (see Epson projector network functions). <br><br><h2>  Conclusions and Comparison Chart </h2><br>  Perhaps this is all that we can tell you about the new models of the so popular category of full HD entry-level projectors.  According to our estimates, the new models are not a revolution, but an evolution: <b>they are about ‚Äú20% cooler‚Äù than the good old Epson EH-TW5200</b> .  Improvements are very "in the subject", as they relate to color, speed of response, work with mobile devices and prices without changing the positioning of the line of devices. <br><br>  In general terms, we can say that the main successor to the Epson EH-TW5200 is the Epson EH-TW5300.  The Epson EH-TW5210 is a more affordable option, and the Epson EH-TW5350 is equipped with the Wireless Display feature. <br><br>  The main differences of the official specifications of the new line from Epson EH-TW5200 are shown in the table below.  We have every reason to believe that new projectors will bring a lot of pleasant sensations to the widest range of buyers. <br><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>  <strong>EH-TW5200 (</strong> <strong>archive)</strong> </td><td>  <strong>EH-TW5210</strong> </td><td>  <strong>EH-TW5300</strong> </td><td>  <strong>EH-TW5350</strong> </td></tr><tr><td>  Brightness, lumen </td><td>  2000 </td><td>  2200 </td><td>  2200 </td><td>  2200 </td></tr><tr><td>  Contrast (dynamic) </td><td>  15000: 1 </td><td>  30,000: 1 </td><td>  35,000: 1 </td><td>  35,000: 1 </td></tr><tr><td>  Brightness in economy mode, lm </td><td>  1400 </td><td>  1500 </td><td>  1500 </td><td>  1500 </td></tr><tr><td>  Lamp resource (bright / economical), hours </td><td>  5000/6000 </td><td>  4000/7500 </td><td>  4000/7500 </td><td>  4000/7500 </td></tr><tr><td>  Uniformity of brightness,% </td><td>  80 </td><td>  85 </td><td>  85 </td><td>  85 </td></tr><tr><td>  Fan noise, dB </td><td>  29 </td><td>  27 </td><td>  27 </td><td>  27 </td></tr><tr><td>  Speaker </td><td>  2 W </td><td>  5 W </td><td>  5 W </td><td>  5 W </td></tr><tr><td>  Frame interpolation function </td><td>  not </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td></tr><tr><td>  Autocorrection of geometry distortion with vertical tilt </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  not </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td></tr><tr><td>  Split Screen function </td><td>  not </td><td>  not </td><td>  not </td><td>  Yes </td></tr><tr><td>  WiFi </td><td>  option </td><td>  not </td><td>  not </td><td>  Yes </td></tr><tr><td>  Miracast / WiDi </td><td>  not </td><td>  not </td><td>  not </td><td>  Yes </td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Questions and answers </h2><br>  As always - carefully monitor the comments and answer your questions! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390431/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390431/</a></p>
