Everyone strives for this, but <s>Sistrom has</s> units. <br><br>  Therefore, if we discard the ‚Äúhonest‚Äù ways of getting into the TOP (which happens with the very same units), then the question is no longer ‚Äúhow‚Äù to get there, but how much it will cost.  After all, if you inadvertently invented nothing that in itself is capable of blowing up the market, breaking through among about 800 thousand applications like yours, this is not an easy task. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Naturally, in such a situation there are many who want to help solve the problem of achieving the desired ‚Äúvisibility‚Äù, getting ‚Äúexposure‚Äù and further according to the scenario: everyone is happy and you are bathing in organic installations that have hit you with an endless stream of users rushing to spend money in your application.  And such services, indirectly and directly hinting at these benefits, are not a few (some more and this market will begin to burst together), but not everyone can and should trust their applications.  You can ‚Äúallow yourself‚Äù to the extent that your application is completely thrown out of the App Store.  And such cases have been.

      Recently, AppGratis, the ‚Äúsuccess story‚Äù (Wake N Shake, Word of The Rings) have promoted their promotion on the market, their promotion is mentioned in quite respected resources.  But getting into the TOP can be done in various ways, and the purchased traffic does not always mean quality traffic and, often, with such guns, it is the incentivized installations that pump up the TOP application.  Therefore, we decided to find out in more detail what this company is, how it pushes applications and how much it costs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5c6/ffe/306/5c6ffe306656ff0669946a8eb9ff88ff.jpg"><br><br>  In short, AppGratis is an application that every day features one application (both paid with discounts and free) from the App Store.  At the moment, the application has more than 10 million users, of whom 3 million use it every day.  Their distinctive feature from other similar applications (Free App Of The Day, AppHero, etc.) is considered to be a ‚Äúunique editorial approach‚Äù, in other words, they do not feature everything in a row, but only applications with excellent ratings and user reviews taking into account local specifics i.e.  application content varies by country.  Thus, the application creates a loyal user base, which they hide behind promising developers non-incentivized installations. <br><br>  According to an interview given by the company's founder Simon Dawlat, AppGratis makes more than $ 1 million per month and does it in two ways. <br>  <b>The first and foremost</b> of them is a partnership with major brands on the CPI.  For example, a fitness app for fitness Nike Plus with a two-month subscription to the service. <br>  <b>The second way</b> for smaller developers is to get a share of their profits in exchange for a million other users.  According to the company, they get their share at the end of the week, which is just the main wave of installations that come from AppGratis plus organic installations due to getting into the TOP.  In some cases (when the earning potential on the target application is rather small), developers pay $ 20,000 in advance for the feature itself (in other words, we will install you, and then you will do it yourself). <br><br>  In terms of scale and coverage of various markets, the application is quite widely represented.  Such countries as the USA, Great Britain, France, Italy, Spain, Germany, Brazil, and Mexico are offered for capturing. <br><br>  From the point of view of the length of the push itself, then from the side of AppGratis it lasts exactly 24 hours, after which you have to go organic as a result of achieving visual stability in the charts.  But here, as they say, it should, but it is not obliged, most likely in a week the application without additional infusion of traffic will smoothly slip down approximately to where it came from.  But the promised installations for getting into the TOP during these 24 hours will be provided to you. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8eb/910/3a9/8eb9103a92f3cef4ec23c62f2bdab893.jpg"><br>  Here you can see the approximate number of installations per day for getting to Top Free (iPhone) in different countries and the budget required for this action. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5b5/2f7/383/5b52f73837b739f5bfe32370d82f335f.jpg"><br><br>  Each install in AppGratis will cost an average of $ 1.8 for Europe, $ 3 for the USA.  By simple arithmetic operations, it turns out that in order to get into the most desirable top free in the US, you will have to fork out about $ 195,000. The figure is not small, and for most indie developers it is completely unbearable. <br><br>  But the question is more likely not in the value of figures, but in the expediency of these expenses from an economic point of view.  This approach takes place if there are IAPs in your free application and you know your ARPU.  This will allow approximately to calculate both the budget of the campaign and the planned profit from it and to find, respectively, the break-even point, which allows to determine the feasibility of such investments. <br><br>  Nor can it be said with certainty that AppGratis offers non-incentivized installations in its purest form.  It is reliably known that the company is interested in buying traffic from ad networks, which gives rise to certain thoughts about the quality of the traffic, which they then convert for their own push companies. <br><br>  The summary is this: it‚Äôs not enough to get into the TOP, you still need to stay in it, for which the application must continue to generate the number of installations necessary for this every day.  But as practice shows, even fairly well-known applications resort to constant traffic injections in order to maintain the application at the desired level of visibility.  And in order for it to make sense in principle (even for a short period of time), the application must have good enough ARPU. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/170635/">https://habr.com/ru/post/170635/</a></p>
