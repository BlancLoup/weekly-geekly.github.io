  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview of Internet Acquiring in Ukraine</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The first bank cards appeared about 50 years ago.  And twenty years later, we were united by a network of familiar ATMs.  And since 1997, bank cards began to accept payments on the Internet.  However, their popularity and availability in Ukraine is only now gaining momentum.  So, if in an ordinary (‚Äúoffline‚Äù) store you don‚Äôt surprise anyone with the option of paying with a card, in Uanet this is still a pleasant surprise. <br><br>  The boom in consumer lending brought banks closer to people, and the penetration of plastic cards into the population increased markedly.  But less actively, banks sell their services on Internet acquiring to Ukrainian business.  The editors of <a href="http://ish.com.ua/">ish.com.ua</a> will conduct a small survey of banks in order to find out which of them provide acquiring services and under what conditions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Banks </h4><br>  Of the more than one hundred and eighty Ukrainian banks, only 4 stated that they provide Internet acquiring service.  Not much, but it could be worse =).  In all four banks, the acquiring connection procedure is approximately the same.  A little later we will return to it, and now we will consider the banks in more detail. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://aval.ua/">Bank Aval - Raiffeisen</a></b> <br>  <i>Open Joint-Stock Company Raiffeisen Bank Aval was registered on March 27, 1992 (until September 25, 2006 - Joint-Stock Post-Pension Bank Aval).</i>  <i>Since October 2005, the bank became part of Raiffeisen International Bank-Holding AG banking holding group.</i>

      Branches are represented in all regions of Ukraine. <br>  Cards: Visa and MasterCard (MasterCard is accepted only on condition that the issuing bank has an appropriate authentication system). <br>  Work through the <a href="http://upc.ua/">Ukrainian processing center</a> <br><br>  <b><a href="http://bank.com.ua/">Pivdenny Bank</a></b> <br>  <i>Joint-stock bank "PIVDENNY" was registered in 1993.</i>  <i>Included in the group of large banks and is a leader in the South of Ukraine.</i> <br><br>  Represented in 14 regions, including in Kiev and Lviv. <br>  Cards: Visa and MasterCard. <br>  Own processing center <br><br>  <b><a href="http://shop.privatbank.ua/">Privat Bank</a></b> <br>  <i>Founded in 1992, Commercial Bank Privat Bank is one of the most dynamically developing banks in Ukraine and occupies a leading position in the country's banking rating.</i> <br><br>  Branches are widely represented in all regions of Ukraine. <br>  Cards: Visa and MasterCard. <br>  Own processing center <br><br>  <b><a href="http://eximb.com/">Ukreximbank</a></b> <br>  <i>Open Joint-Stock Company ‚ÄúState Export-Import Bank of Ukraine‚Äù was established on January 3, 1992 in accordance with Presidential Decree N29, and on January 23 of the same year, the bank received its first license from the National Bank of Ukraine.</i> <br><br>  Branches are represented in all regions of Ukraine. <br>  Cards: Visa (MasterCard connection is scheduled for early 2009) <br>  Own processing center <br><br>  All listed banks have a similar connection procedure.  You will need to open an account and provide the following documents: certificate of state registration;  for legal entities certificate of registration in the Unified State Register of Enterprises and Organizations of Ukraine (EDRPOU).  You may also need information that you or your company have the right to conduct trading operations or to provide services;  certificate confirming that the domain on which the site is located belongs to you.  The latter should be taken care of in advance, as domain registration often occurs on an individual, without specifying information about the company or form of ownership. <br><br>  Now it's up to you.  It is worth noting that the percentage of the bank for Internet acquiring transactions is 5% of the amount, and if the payment was made with cards issued at this bank, they will take 4% from you.  Depending on your turnover, the bank may revise this percentage in your favor.  Therefore, we will not take into account the bank's fee when choosing it.  But what you should pay attention to is its reputation among your colleagues and competitors.  This information is enough on the Internet to add your own opinion and make an assessment. <br><br>  The second criterion when choosing a bank will be, perhaps, the range of its services for entrepreneurs and organizations.  It is worthwhile to carefully examine the availability of convenient and inexpensive Internet banking.  Choose a package of current account maintenance that is beneficial for you, as well as conditions for issuing and servicing cards to it  To kill two birds with one stone, it is advisable to find out all this information personally in the branches where you are going to be serviced.  You will have an idea about the quality of service and competence of employees and the speed of response to your questions by customer support, because  in the presence of Internet banking, the geographical proximity of branches does not matter, and the work of an online store takes place round the clock, then it is worth paying attention to the support operation mode. <br><br><h4>  NSMEP </h4><br>  The banks described earlier work with international payment systems Visa and MasterCard.  However, in Ukraine there is a national payment system.  In 2000, the National Bank of Ukraine registered the trademark NSMEP (National Electronic Payment System).  The main purpose of this system was to offer the population an inexpensive and profitable payment card, for non-cash payments for services and goods.  The same card can be paid in Uanetne. <br><br>  More than forty banks and non-banking institutions are involved in issuing and acquiring NSMEP cards in Ukraine.  However, only one bank announced loudly about the Internet-acquiring service of this system: <a href="http://smartpay.com.ua/">Imembank</a> <a href="http://imexbank.com.ua/">JSCB</a> , having created the <a href="http://smartpay.com.ua/">Smartpay</a> service. <br><br>  Connecting to this system is almost identical to connecting to the Internet acquiring of Visa and MasterCard cards.  But a visitor to your online store will need to purchase a special card reader with which he will be able to use the NSMEP card more extensively, so you should not worry about these wastes. <br><br>  The national system of mass electronic payments, in spite of its nearly nine years, is just beginning to be mastered by consumers.  In addition to the unpronounceable name, on the way to the successful integration of this system with e-commerce in Ukraine is also the need for the consumer to purchase a special device for work.  Therefore, NSMEP should not be considered as an alternative, but only as an addition to the Visa and MasterCard payment systems in your online store. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://ish.com.ua/">All about online stores in Ukrainian realities</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/49254/">https://habr.com/ru/post/49254/</a></p>
