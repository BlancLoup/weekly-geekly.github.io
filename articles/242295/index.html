  <section class="page js-page"><h1>First week report at Oxygen Accelerator</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Our participation in the Oxygen Accelerator program in London continues.  A week has passed, and we are already beginning to take shape understanding of how the acceleration process will be built.  Our team, which has come up with all the previous projects and tried to develop on its own, this approach, of course, is new, but that‚Äôs even more interesting.  Based on previous experience, you can quickly see your typical mistakes in project management, flaws, improper planning and other moments, the realization of which can take an unforgivably large amount of time in the flow of an ordinary working routine.  Here, all this is quickly revealed thanks to a fresh objective look from experienced representatives of the English startup scene and professionals from related industries: marketing specialists, PR specialists, salespeople. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/880/aab/73d/880aab73dd5947cb813eb7fb6ad31172.JPG" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The week began with a quick run through the main methodologies: lean startup, pirate metrics, creation and testing of your KPI.  Following the results of small presentations, it was necessary to make canvases. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e2/8a0/1bd/8e28a01bd7ec4e9d997a73c66d740b0a.JPG">

      The next two days were completely spent on individual communication between the accelerator team and start-ups, the so-called board meetings, where specific problems and ways of development of each project were discussed.  In our case, this session took about an hour and a half and we spent another half hour with the marketing specialist from Oxygen.  Already at this stage, as a result of joint brainstorming, some of our ideas for development have changed.  I suspect that this will happen more than once in the next 3 months. <br><br>  A few more presentations that took place in the first week mainly consisted of stories of successful entrepreneurs and quite specific master classes, at which it was possible to go at will to those teams or team members who found them useful.  Here is an example of what it takes to open a company in the UK;  how to write a press release;  how to use mentors during acceleration. <br><br>  Among the most interesting presentations in my opinion were the following: <br><br>  Ian Broom, the founder of the <a href="http://fliplet.com/">fliplet</a> project and a graduate of last year's accelerator from Oxygen, who managed to sell his system to such giants as Marriott, NatWest, Samsung, and others talks about b2b sales techniques. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e32/512/1a7/e325121a787544579f413a5884bd7df5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Matt Robinson, the founder of the <a href="https://gocardless.com/">GoCardless</a> payment system, talks about his experience in creating and raising a startup, which has now become a business of five dozen employees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/47e/b66/84c/47eb6684c1ee41f79618b5d6f02dd32d.jpg"><br><br>  Since the first week of acceleration coincided with the celebration of Halloween, we naturally could not miss the social benefits of our being here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e4e/a5d/aba/e4ea5dabaaa844cf8c6e8ce07c9944a8.JPG"><br><br>  The week ended with a warm get-together with beer and wine, where all the accelerator participants discussed what they had done in a week, shared their skills and discussed who could help whom and with what. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/254/1b7/d46/2541b7d468bd4b5ebdedb23a194ba70a.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/504/181/9e9/5041819e9de841e1beeacb7d43969836.JPG"><br><br>  We have scheduled meetings with mentors and a master class on investment pitches this week, so wait for new posts! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/242295/">https://habr.com/ru/post/242295/</a></p>
