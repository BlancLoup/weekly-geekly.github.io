  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Registration for the fifth annual championship on sports programming Russian Code Cup has begun</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ba/fc5/ed6/7bafc5ed6da441c1989159ab7961ad91.jpg"><br><br>  Since March 5, registration for participation in the main Russian championship on sports programming - the <a href="https://www.russiancodecup.ru/">Russian Code Cup</a> (RCC) is open.  The winners of the championship will win the title of the best programmers of the year and share the prize fund in the amount of 750,000 rubles.  Several thousand Russian-speaking participants from around the world take part in the RCC annually.  They fight for the title of not only the most talented, but also the fastest programmer, since the solution of the original and complex tasks of the championship is evaluated by two criteria at once: quality and speed.  This championship gives young programmers an excellent opportunity to demonstrate their skills, gain recognition from the professional community and attract the attention of large IT companies. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This year, the RCC begins with a ‚Äúwarming up‚Äù round, which starts on March 15 at 1:00 pm.  The results of this stage are not taken into account in the following rounds;  It is held so that participants can warm up and evaluate their strength before the main rounds of the championship.  The main program of the championship traditionally consists of three stages: qualifying rounds, qualifying round and final.  At each stage, participants must solve from four to eight diverse tasks.  Tasks and technical part of the competition are provided by Mail.Ru Group specialists and experts from ITMO. <br><br>  In the course of the first two stages, competitions are held online at the Russian Code Cup website.  Three qualifying rounds will start on March 28, April 25 and May 31.  Those who are unlucky in the first qualifying round may try their luck in the subsequent ones.  In the qualifying round, scheduled for June 14, 200 best participants from each qualifying round will pass.  A 50 programmers who showed the best results in the selection, compete in the final.  With each stage, the complexity of the tasks will increase, and in the final the most difficult of them will be proposed.  The final round will be held on September 19.

      The winner, who demonstrated the highest results in speed and quality of problem solving during the championship, will receive a cash prize of 300 thousand rubles;  holders of second and third place - 150 thousand and 90 thousand rubles, respectively.  Programmers, ranked from fourth to tenth place, will get 30 thousand rubles.  In addition, all 50 finalists will receive T-shirts with the symbols of the championship, and 600 participants in the qualifying round will receive online certificates confirming their qualifications. <br><br>  Register for participation in the RCC will be on our <a href="http://cups.mail.ru/">new site</a> , which we recently launched.  From now on, information on other annual IT competitions held by us will also be presented: <br><ul><li>  Artificial Intelligence Programming Championship <a href="http://russianaicup.ru/">Russian AI Cup</a> , </li><li>  competition for developers of applications, games and Internet services of the <a href="http://russiandevcup.ru/">Russian Developers Cup</a> , </li><li>  competition for interface designers <a href="https://russiandesigncup.ru/">Russian Design Cup</a> . </li></ul><br>  Now the participants will have a single account for all championships.  In whatever competition Mail.Ru Group you are involved in, you will need to register only once.  You can use your login and password to access the site of any of our championships.  We also decided to rebrand the logos and graphic design of all Mail.Ru Group championships.  The basis is a pentagonal chart, each vertex of which symbolizes a strategy, a visualization, a product, a fan, an algorithm.  Each form in the logo represents one of the championships.  For example, the green pentagon is the Russian Design Cup.  In the designated coordinate system, he is more committed to visuality, a little less to fan and product.  Yellow - Russian Code Cup, most of all it is to the algorithms, strategies and fan. <br><br>  In the meantime, on the <a href="http://www.russiancodecup.ru/">Russian Code Cup</a> website you can see examples of tasks and learn detailed rules for conducting RCC.  By the way, a special <a href="https://vk.com/cupmrg">VKontakte group</a> is available for the participants of the championships and interested ones, where they can find information about creating artificial intelligence, web-design, sports programming, developing interfaces, marketing and creating IT projects.  The materials of the group include the opinions of industry experts, useful literature, master classes, educational videos, the best thematic conferences, as well as all the most interesting events in the IT sphere.  Subscribers of the group will be the first to know all the important news about the Mail.Ru Group competitions and other Russian and international IT championships. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/251331/">https://habr.com/ru/post/251331/</a></p>
