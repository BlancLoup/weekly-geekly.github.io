  <section class="page js-page"><h1>SMP ON-Bank: Birth</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello friends! <br>  You already know enough about the functionality of ONP-Bank SMP, and today you will learn how it appeared. <br>  It's no secret that many of us live beyond our means.  Buy your favorite thing, and then think about how to live to your next paycheck, borrow money from relatives or friends and return the debt for months - quite in our nature. <br>  When our heads (all at once!) Decided to launch a new Internet bank, we began to think how to make it special, not like everyone else.  Having arranged a collective brainstorm and thought out a day or two, we tried to put ourselves in the shoes of customers and understand their needs in order to create a truly useful and necessary product.  Just to fill in the functionality of the ability to conduct operations with accounts, convert currencies, getting account statements is boring and uncreative.  And here we remembered the mysterious Russian soul, which requires living beyond its means, and thought: “Eureka!  Why not connect Internet banking with a personal finance management system? ”And we did it! <br><a name="habracut"></a>  We appreciated what is on the market and decided to do better.  They took as a basis the already existing popular services - the American online service “Mint”, the Russian offline service “Zhadyuga” and the online service “EasyFinance” and other similar products.  Day and night, we carefully studied them, looked at them through the eyes of users, and thought how to dodge them in terms of usability and utility. <br>  Mint and The Jadi have a lot in common, but there are also enough differences.  First of all, as we already noted above, one system is American and online, the second is Russian and offline.  This means that “Mint” can be used in any place where there is access to the Internet, but “Jadiuga” can be used only on the computer where the program is installed. <br>  “Mint” can be “tied” to accounts in almost any American bank that provides the “Internet Banking” service: information about completed transactions will be automatically entered into the system.  We really liked this idea, and we implemented it in the SMP ON-Bank: as you know, expenses on SMP Bank cards fall into the system and are divided into categories without any user involvement - no extra gestures are required. <br>  The function of setting limits (remember our post “We created a financial conscience?”) We also borrowed from Mint.  The “Jadiugi” does not have it due to its offline nature. <br>  In general, in the “Mint” service, the emphasis is on the analysis and control of bank accounts.  However, this is not surprising: Americans actively use cards and almost do not use cash.  In Russia, for the time being, everything is different: cards are often used to payroll and receive it later at an ATM in cash.  This is due to the habit and unwillingness of people to trust their money to banks and, of course, insufficiently developed infrastructure (try to pay with a card in a street tent!).  Knowing all this, we gave the users of SMP ON-Bank the opportunity to make expenses and incomes into the system manually, as the users of Zhadyugi and EasyFinance do. <br>  The principal difference between the On-Bank SMP and its “predecessors” is that with its help you can not only analyze and control cash flows, but also conduct transactions with your own funds.  The standard functions of the Internet bank, as you understand, are not available either in “Jadiug”, or in “Mint”, or in “EasyFinance”. <br>  What is important for Russian users: you will have to pay for the “Jadiuga” if your monthly income is above 10,000 rubles, and connecting an ON-Bank SMP, as well as using it, is absolutely free, whether you are a millionaire! <br>  Instead of a conclusion.  From the Mint website: “Simply amazing.  This is exactly what each bank should actually be offering these days. ”(Jay R., Minneapolis, MN).  We are first! </div>
