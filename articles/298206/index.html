Most of them do not require special investments and will keep your budget. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>1. Write deep content</b> 
      <br>

      It is no secret that <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2012/12/20/the-science-behind-long-copy-how-more-content-increases-rankings-and-conversions/">Google</a> loves articles deep in content.  We obtained a brighter picture to confirm this by analyzing data from <a href="http://blog.serpiq.com/how-important-is-content-length-why-data-driven-seo-trumps-guru-opinions/">serpIQ</a> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca0/79b/39b/ca079b39bf494b9d97780e884a36f46f.jpg"><br><br>  This works not only with search engines.  Readers also love long articles and are happy to share them with friends.  Remember, one long article can do much more for your business than a series of short ones. <br><br>  <b>2. Use frequently asked questions as headings for content.</b> <br><br>  Clients always have problems, and they are looking for ways to solve them by asking you questions in the FAQ section.  Instead of giving dry answers, make a detailed article on this topic.  Then you will know for sure that the article is helpful and helps clients solve problems. <br><br>  <b>3. Use multimedia as content.</b> <br><br>  Stop wasting good ideas on just one type of media, namely text.  There are quite powerful multimedia sources that can be used as a presentation of their products, summing up over time, the company's success story, etc. <br><br>  <b>Video content</b> <br><br>  Currently dominant on the Internet.  78% of people say they watch online videos every week and 55% say they do it daily.  <a href="https://searchenginewatch.com/sew/study/2333878/video-helps-persuade-73-of-people-to-buy-a-product-or-service-survey">Animoto</a> research found that video content helps convince 73% of consumers to buy a product or service.  <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/ip-ngn-ip-next-generation-network/white_paper_c11-481360.html">Cisco</a> predicts that in 2016, online video will drive 55% of web traffic. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/EEW83KQiY0Y%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi-0hFQzVW6P6ZMOE1RWKtWLi8uhg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Tips for creating video content for B2B: <br><ul><li>  Do not forget that your viewers are educated people, respectively, your video should not be comic so as not to make them feel embarrassed. </li><li>  Tell us about the benefits of your product and how it can solve the problems of buyers. </li><li>  Accompany the video with a small amount of text in the form of a running line.  It will be more effective if viewers not only listen to the offscreen text, but also read it. </li><li>  Formulate your message as simply and concisely as possible. </li><li>  Use video infographics. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Presentations</b> <br><br>  Anna Hoffman reached <a href="http://www.trafficgenerationcafe.com/slideshare-traffic/">243,000</a> views of her blog using slide presentations.  They are used for better learning.  It was proved that visually a person perceives <a href="http://www.braintools.ru/article/1305">90% of the</a> information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a47/d86/7df/a47d867df71243959e6b2218c9d4f814.png"><br><br>  Tips for creating a presentation: <br><br><ul><li>  20-30 slides will be enough to not tire the public. </li><li>  Analyze the target audience and articulate the topic clearly. </li><li>  Collect and systematize all the necessary material, write theses, main thoughts, informational messages, numbers, trying to avoid complicated confusing phrases and detailed graphs. </li><li>  Do not use too bright colors, the best option is pastel colors. </li><li>  Use easily readable standard fonts (Times New Roman, Tahoma) in black. </li><li>  On the slides should be photographs, graphics, pictures and diagrams, not just beautiful drawings or meaningless landscapes.  The text below the slide should correspond to the image. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Infographics</b> <br><br>  <a href="https://www.currencyliquidator.com/">Currency Liquidator</a> transformed its dry information about currency security features into infographics to attract more attention.  Any information with multiple digits can be transformed into infographics: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a27/c04/cfc/a27c04cfc5aa4f009f36b65020bd67aa.jpg"><br><br>  Tips for creating infographics: <br><br><ul><li>  Tell a story in pictures.  Do not use too much text; </li><li>  Create a point of focus attention, do not make a "mess" of the images; </li><li>  It is important to avoid different colors and font styles.  The main rule is no more than 2 different font styles (maximum 3).  Remember, a simple font is easy to read.  Do not be inspired by changes in fonts, it will confuse and upset the reader.  Make sure the font is not very small.  Suitable - from 14 to 18 points, depending on the style.  Headings and subheadings are usually slightly larger than regular text. </li><li>  Do not get carried away!  Do smaller identical diagrams in order not to worsen the perception of infographics. </li><li>  Choose the right color </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/164/d2e/ccb/164d2eccb3fb4c36b976ba076028f5d6.png"><br><br>  Do you think your business will benefit from multimedia sources?  Anyway worth a try. <br><br>  <b>4. Distribute content</b> <br><br>  By distributing content that someone recently published can increase your traffic and get more readers.  An example of how Mary Smith uses this tactic: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a3/c11/e88/8a3c11e88916400eb5003a976a7bc589.png"><br><br>  She created her own blog and makes posts with links to information from other sites, and then writes a small remark about why it should be used.  The same tactics can be used in the field of B2B with the indication of sources of materials. <br><br>  <b>5. Cooperation with your industry experts.</b> <br><br>  Experts in your industry have already created their audience and have authority in their industry.  Start building relationships with these powerful people.  If there is a mutual understanding between you, you can find creative ways of cooperation in future projects. <br>  When working on a common project, the expert is likely to share this information with his audience.  This will open you up as a new brand and become the strongest impetus for the growth of your business. <br>  You can also interview an influential colleague and make an article based on this.  People are always interested to know the success story of an influential person and his company, or to get acquainted with tips for doing business. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/38d/0a8/c31/38d0a8c31e504b5ab8d6ce457b4ef4fb.png"><br><br>  <b>6.Optimization of high traffic publications</b> <br><br>  Read some of your most popular publications and rate them in terms of marketing.  After you do this, answer the question: what content has brought more traffic? <br>  When you answered, go to less popular publications and focus on improving content, calls to action to increase conversion. <br><br>  Ways to animate content: <br><br><ul><li>  Update the publication: add new statistics, cases and preview in social networks. </li><li>  If the article is still relevant, but not popular, try turning it into a series of email newsletters. </li><li>  Hold a webinar on the topic of an unpopular article, adding to its interest. </li><li>  Turn your article into a presentation or infographic. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>7. Hold onto the ‚ÄúRules of Seven Touch‚Äù</b> <br><br>  This rule went from conventional marketing and soon became popular in online marketing.  It says that you need to make seven touches with the customer before he buys the goods.  First you need to determine the point of initial contact, then create a chain of 7 touches based on the first contact in order to find mutual understanding. <br>  Tip: Use automatic messages to create the first contact, such as: confirmation of the subscription, welcome email, thank-you email, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f9d/340/7f5/f9d3407f5efc4c70b2fad4c0c9e81860.png"><br><br>  <b>8. Use non-standard welcome emails.</b> <br><br>  When a visitor becomes a subscriber, you send him a welcome email.  Many businesses use boring standard posts.  You can optimize them: <br><br><ul><li>  Ask for cooperation; </li><li>  Advertise popular products; </li><li>  Demonstrate new content, resources and applications. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dce/d54/172/dced541729724080bc0f4de99cabde4a.png"><br><br>  All this is done to ensure that the client stays with you as long as possible. <br><br>  Despite the fact that the B2B sphere is considered rather conservative, try to add colors to it.  Managers of large companies also seek to receive positive emotions, quality information, and you are able to do this with your content.  Successes! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298206/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298206/</a></p>
