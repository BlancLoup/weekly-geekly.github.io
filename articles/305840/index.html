      <b>Train ticket</b> <br><br>  <b>Publisher:</b> Days of Wonder <br>  <b>Type:</b> board game for 2-5 people;  Players must collect cards and build a railroad. <br>  <b>Difficulty level:</b> medium <br>  <b>Creator:</b> Alan Moon <br>  <b>Luck factor:</b> moderate <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a3a/ad7/e6f/a3aad7e6f0414270a95a18b0227e9881.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Description: The</b> playing field is a map of the country, on which the large cities and the railway tracks connecting them are marked - they are marked with colored segments.  Players draw cards from a deck or bank consisting of 5 cards lying in the open to collect a sufficient number of cards of the same color and lay a railway track of the corresponding color on the card.  The longer the paved path, the more points the player gets. <br><br>  At the end of the game, players can receive additional rewards if they manage to connect the cities indicated on the mission cards they received during the distribution.  These cards are not revealed until the end of the game.  At the same time, players lose points if they fail to complete the mission indicated on the card. <br><br>  <b>Game Review</b> <br><br>  There are a number of versions of the ‚ÄúTrain Ticket‚Äù, differing from each other by playing field maps, city names, roads, missions, and partly by the rules of the game.  In this article I will refer to the basic version, the action of which unfolds on the map of the United States. <br><br>  Cities are mapped according to their real geographical location.  They are interconnected by a network of roads, each of which is a sequence of blocks in the shape of trailers.  Each road is painted in one of 10 bright colors or gray.  Some roads have double markings and are painted either bright or gray.  In a game of 2-3 players, you can assign only one marking line, but if 4-5 people take part in the game, both lines of the road marking can be assigned by different players. <br>  The main goal of the game is to connect different cities on the map, placing the wagons on the roads, assign them to yourself and earn points depending on the length of the paved road.  To assign a road, the player must pay with cards of the corresponding bright color.  For long roads rely more points - one section of the road of three trailers will bring the player more points than three sections of one trailer. <br><br>  Particularly valuable sections of the road from 6 cabins - for them relies 15 points.  You can assign any open road, but it is not necessary to do this consistently.  However, the sequence in assigning the road reduces the risk that another player will ‚Äúbreak‚Äù it, and this will adversely affect your balance. <br><br>  At the beginning of the game, each player receives 3 mission cards, one of which can be reset if desired.  On each card are the names of the two cities that need to be connected by rail (usually the cities are located so far from each other that it is impossible to connect them by one road), as well as the reward due for this.  To complete the mission, the player must build a continuous chain of roads connecting 2 cities.  The length of the road does not matter, the main thing is its continuity. <br>  Cards with completed missions are opened only at the end of the game when scoring.  This makes it difficult to understand what goals each player has until the end of the game.  If the mission is not completed, the number of reward points indicated on the card is debited from the player‚Äôs balance.  After the player has accepted the mission card, it is no longer possible to reset it, so it is very important to leave only those missions that you can complete.  Because of the need to complete missions, the emphasis in the game is on laying the road, not blocking other players. <br><br>  The player who laid the longest continuous road, at the end of the game gets 10 bonus points - a trifle, but nice. <br><br>  In one move, a player can perform actions of three types, and only one of them is necessarily present at each turn: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The most common action is to pull out 2 ‚ÄúWagon‚Äù cards.  Each card has its own color;  an exception is the card "Engine" - a universal rainbow card.  Despite the fact that the cards show different types of cars, only their color matters.  At any moment of the game, there are 5 open cards on the field and a deck of the remaining cards face up. <br><br>  The player can either take 2 open cards, or pull out the top 2 cards from the deck blindly - the order of these actions does not matter.  Cards taken from the open ones are immediately replaced by the upper ones from the deck.  If among the open cards lies the steam locomotive, and the player takes it, this turn he will no longer be able to pick up the ‚ÄúWagon‚Äù cards.  If a player has already pulled out a card, he does not have the right to take the Steam Locomotive this turn. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Players pull cards in order to assign sections of the road - this is the second type of action.  The player must pay with cards of the corresponding bright color in order to assign a certain section of paths;  A rainbow card can be used instead of a card of any color.  Gray sections of the road can be closed with one bright color or a rainbow card.  None of the participants can pick up a section of the road assigned to them from the player.  Because of the need to complete missions, the emphasis in the game is on laying the road, not blocking other players, and for the same reason players try to usurp the main roads until someone else has done it. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ On his turn, a player can optionally get 3 additional mission cards.  Having looked at them, he can fold one or two new cards.  Usually, they first carry out missions from the cards received during the first distribution, and only then get additional cards.  A more subtle strategy: the cards constantly get in the hope that the sections of the road laid as part of the new missions will fit into the already existing route and help to compensate for the points that are removed for incomplete missions. <br>  In the American version, each player starts with 45 Cars.  If someone has two or less wagons left, all players without exception get one more turn, after which the final scoring begins. <br><br>  Of the three actions possible on each turn, players most often choose one - draw cards (2 cards per turn).  For each closed section of the road you have to pay with one card - thus, a player who started a game with four cards requires at least 21 turns and several more moves to pave the road to complete the game.  An ingenious player, as a rule, uses almost all the cards he has drawn.  Another strategy of the game is the following: you need to try to finish the game before all the other players complete their missions. <br><br>  I have seen cases when a player acquires a huge number of cards at an early stage of the game.  The more cards - the more paths of development.  In addition, at the very beginning of the game, the prospect of pulling out rainbow cards looks very tempting.  As players assign road sections and the number of open roads between cities decreases, not all cards from the deck are attractive to the player. <br>  For such a tactic, the first action is to lay a road of six sections-trailers.  In addition, this tactic does not limit the player in the choice - he does not need to rely on any particular road when performing missions, and opponents find it harder to unravel his plan. <br><br>  <b>What can be learned from this game?</b> <br><br>  Of all the German-style board games described in this article, ‚ÄúTrain Ticket‚Äù is perhaps the simplest.  In fact, this is an ordinary collectible card game, but with elements of a complex strategy.  Even with a solid experience in the game "Train Ticket", you can never decide for yourself which way of laying the tracks is the most advantageous.  And the ability to pull out more missions, thereby increasing the luck factor, is in itself an interesting tactic. <br><br>  In fact, the essence of the game comes down to connecting the points on the chart.  All games as such are abstract simulations, but it happens that the simulated phenomenon is already abstract in itself.  Recently, the computer games industry has been developing in two directions: action games, in which emphasis is placed on the most accurate reproduction of reality, as well as casual and role-playing games, where clear sets of rules play a significant role, and the reality display is rather conditional. <br><br>  The focus on realistic games has created first-person shooters with complex physics, and the utmost attention to the rules is quests in which ‚Äúbattles‚Äù are carried out using unusual mechanisms.  As an example of the second, there are puzzle games based on Tetris. <br>  The first path ultimately turns out to be a dead end - what to strive for when the realism of the game reaches its maximum or is it basically unattainable?  But the second way generally leads to thoughts about the decline of game design.  In theory, the Tetris gameplay, a collectible card game or Tower Defense is no different from physical combat as the process of choosing options from the menu, but in reality many elements are lost as gaming systems become more and more abstract. <br><br>  The best German-style board games masterfully combine abstract gaming systems and the setting, which differs little from the real life situation.  "Train ticket" is a great example. <br><br>  <b>Carcassonne</b> <br><br>  <b>Publishers:</b> Hans im Gl√ºck, Rio Grande Games and 999 Games <br>  <b>Type:</b> strategy game for 2-4 people;  Players must piece by piece the playing field and capture the territory. <br>  <b>Difficulty level:</b> medium <br>  <b>Creator:</b> Klaus-J√ºrgen Rede <br>  <b>Luck factor:</b> moderate <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa1/d6b/640/fa1d6b640d2d45c98576aa5b326a5b19.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Description:</b> Together, the players make a map of the medieval kingdom of squares with a painted relief.  In this case, the squares must be in contact with each other. <br><br>  After the player has laid out the next square, he can capture a part of the territory by putting his chip on the square.  This is the main goal of the game - to increase their possession and not allow other players to do the same. <br><br>  <b>Game Review</b> <br><br>  "Carcassonne" belongs to the German-style board games: players cannot openly fight each other, but opponents can be put in wheels in an indirect way. <br>  At the beginning of the game, the starting square is laid out in the middle of the table.  Then the players take turns pulling the closed squares and attach them to the already laid out.  At the same time in the place of contact of the sides the relief should coincide.  Each player has a certain number of chips, or "subjects", which can be put on the squares.  Depending on the size and type of territories captured in this way, players receive different points. <br><br>  When the lined square leads to the completion of the construction of one of the objects (which will be discussed later), the points are counted, and the chips are returned back to the players.  Unfinished objects bring points at the end of the game. <br><br>  In the basic rules of the game there are 4 types of objects: <br><br>  –Ç  The city brings points for each square on which it is drawn, as well as for each shield in this city.  If the city is completed, that is, completely surrounded by walls, points are doubled.  However, on some squares, the city expands at once in all directions, so it may be difficult to complete construction. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The road can only expand in two directions and is considered to be completed when both its ends run into other objects.  Roads allow you to quickly earn points without using a lot of chips.  As after the completion of the construction of the city, all the chips that are on the constructed road, are returned back to the owners.  But unlike the city, the completed road does not bring double points. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The monastery occupies only one cell and brings points for each square surrounding it.  On the one hand, if you put a piece on the monastery, the rivals will not be able to capture it.  On the other - the city can bring a lot more points.  After the construction of the monastery is completed, the chip returns to the player, but the points do not double.  Building a monastery is beneficial only for its owner, so one cannot do without a share of luck here. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ A field brings in 3 points for each completed city adjoining it (regardless of the size of the field itself), and only at the end of the game.  Therefore, putting the chip on the field, the player will not be able to return it back.  The fields often grow and touch many cities, which means that at the end of the game they can bring a lot of points.  However, be prepared for the fact that they rip on your rivals.  To maximize the use of the field, you need to learn how to combine them. <br><br>  If a blindly selected square can be laid out according to the rules, the player is obliged to do this, even if it is not in his interests (for example, if the square completes the construction of the city or the opponent‚Äôs road). <br>  The chip can only be placed on the square played on its turn.  But if the object drawn on it is already occupied by another chip, you cannot do it.  Thus, you can be in a stalemate, not being able to complete construction or seize new territory. <br><br>  Despite the fact that the chips can not be put on the already captured territory, sometimes it happens that on the same object there are citizens of different players.  This happens when the chip appeared on the square before it connected to another square.  In such cases, only the player who has the most chips on the object receives points.  If the chips are equally, both players get points.  So, if you skillfully place your subjects on the map, you can not only reduce the influence of your opponents, but even select their points when counting. <br>  An even more insidious tactic is to lay out the squares around the empty plots necessary to complete the construction of other objects, as a result of which they will stand idle.  As long as cities, roads or monasteries are not fully completed, citizens cannot be taken from them, and considering that there are only seven chips, their owners will be in a very disadvantageous position.  In addition, unfinished cities bring 2 times less points.  Whether you are lucky to draw the necessary square is another question, but in general this is a very effective tactic. <br>  In order to realistically assess your chances for the completion of an important object, it does not hurt to remember the peculiarities of the squares and monitor their appearance in the game.  This is especially useful in cases where squares are already lined around the missing section, and the more, the more difficult it will be to find a square with a matching relief. <br><br>  The dynamics of most German-style games are very different for two and for three players, so it is usually recommended to play at least three of these games.  "Carcassonne" - one of the few European nastolk, in which not only can, but even more interesting to play together. <br><br>  With two players, capturing the opponent's territories takes on a completely different meaning - if two players have the same number of chips at the same facility, neither of them gets points, although in the game with three participants both points are awarded points. <br><br>  <b>What can be learned from this game?</b> <br><br>  Total not count.  First, pay attention to the differences in gameplay for two and three players.  Secondly, it is noteworthy that ‚ÄúCarcassonne‚Äù is a game in which it is necessary to capture territories, and at the same time there is no combat system.  Tactical battles are found in almost every computer strategy, and their absence allows you to look at the genre from a new perspective. <br>  Note: Players who are already familiar with Carcassonne are advised to visit the English-language Wikipedia game page, where the main differences between the rules of different editions are indicated. <br><br>  <b>Colonialists: a card game</b> <br><br>  <b>Publishers:</b> Kosmos and Mayfair Games <br>  <b>Type:</b> two-player card strategy <br>  <b>Difficulty level:</b> medium <br>  <b>Creator:</b> Klaus Teuber <br>  <b>Luck factor:</b> moderate <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/932/90b/c47/93290bc472cf44b7acc0cb47a2ee51f5.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Description:</b> Players accumulate resources for which they can play development cards from their deck and thus earn victory points.  As in the original "Colonialists", in the card version the amount of resources produced is determined by the die roll, but here each player has his own field, and the opposition is realized only in the form of a struggle for resources. <br><br>  This game is surprisingly multifaceted - in this sense, it even surpasses the original ‚ÄúColonialists‚Äù - so this review will be a bit more superficial than all the others from this article. <br><br>  Each player has his own kingdom, laid out from the cards.  At the beginning of the game, it has 2 settlements and 6 types of land, each of which has its own card.  Players receive these cards immediately before the start of the game.  Such cards have a special shirt that helps to distinguish them from the rest of the deck.  They will not be the same for all players, but generally quite similar. <br>  As in the board game ‚ÄúColonialists‚Äù, each sushi card has its own number.  When throwing, use 2 dice, but only one of them is marked with numbers.  The second cube, the so-called event cube, is marked up with special symbols that trigger various events.  At the beginning of each turn, both dice are thrown, so events happen very often.  The number that has fallen on the cube with numbers determines which cards produce a resource on a given turn for both players.  Both players have the same sushi card, but the numbers are different, so the players begin to receive resources of different types, but equally quickly. <br><br>  Sushi cards mostly correspond to sushi hexes from desktop "Colonizers": <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Woods produce wood.  It is most useful at the beginning of the game. <br> ‚Ä¢   .     ,  ,      . <br> ‚Ä¢   .   . <br> ‚Ä¢  ‚Äì  ,       ,    .        . <br> ‚Ä¢    ,       . <br> ‚Ä¢  ,   ,  .     ,     ,  . <br><br>      ,       .       ,    ,    ( 0  3).      ,    ,        . <br><br>     ,    2 ,    (     ,     ,     ): <br><br> ‚Ä¢      ,        .  ,    ,         .    ,      .    ¬´ ¬ª ‚Äì   ,   .    ,   ,  ,       . <br> ‚Ä¢       ,        7  ,       .     ¬´¬ª,          ,   .      ¬´¬ª,          . <br>  2   ,     .        .
