I understand that it is not the business to stun some unconvincing information from the bay-floundering like this, so I suggest first to turn to history a little. <br><br>  So, there was once in America (which is the United States) one (by the way - the most popular in the same place) site - About.com.  He lived for himself, he didn‚Äôt bother, and our user was somehow on ... to the bulb in general.  But!  The inevitable happened - about a year ago, its owners started voting on this site to find out which programs are the most useful and worthy of attention.  They did everything as it should: they came up with the categories, wrote out the names of the programs from the directories, and started surveys.  And here it is necessary to note one important detail: in the list of categories were two, associated with browsers - "The best desktop web browser" and "The best mobile web browser."  It is clear - all the variations of Opera there and hit, moreover, two browsers squeezed into the mobile category as much as two browsers - Opera Mobile and Opera Mini.  In general, what is there to tell for a long time - all three Norwegian browsers turned out to be winners (in the mobile category - ‚Äúgold‚Äù + ‚Äúsilver‚Äù).  If anyone is interested, you can read about those events <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/opera/83131/">here</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/opera/85385/">here</a> . <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  However, this is not to boast - in fact, the reason for the article is more prosaic: they again took up their own.  In the sense of - About.com.  Well, again vote.  Togo.  In general, opened.  And what is remarkable: now Opera products are already presented in four categories, but this is not all.  In the category of best design, a project called <b>Z-1 Glass</b> is presented - this is a skin for Opera, if someone does not know as well as me.  And this is undoubtedly good news.

      But there is a bad one.  Even two.  In general, I will start from afar.  There is such a country - China.  A lot of people live in it, the darkness is simple, but for some reason its people live even more abroad.  And not fools, I must say.  A lot of things they can do.  Well - those in China.  And it seems to me personally that it is not without purpose.  I think that those who do not live in China, look around and remember that what is good in the world is being done.  And then they go home to China for a business trip, or those who live in China come to them - in fact, it‚Äôs absolutely impossible to figure out who goes to whom, but, however, those that are not in China tell those who are in China about everything they saw and heard.  And those in China themselves are already doing all sorts of useful things that everyone in the world likes and about which those who are not in China have told them. <br><br>  In general, it turned out somehow difficult.  Okay, forget everything I just said.  Remember only one thing: there is a lot of these Chinese in total.  And therefore, in the ‚ÄúBest Mobile Browser‚Äù category, the Chinese version wins by a large margin, while Opera Mini, from which, in fact, the Chinese version was copied, remains in second place.  IMHO - somehow it is wrong.  If you think so too, you can <a href="http://browsers.about.com/od/allaboutwebbrowsers/ss/2011-readers-choice-awards-web-browsers-voting_3.htm%26poll_id%3D7209960136%26poll%3D4%26submit1%3DSubmit%2520Vote">vote</a> accordingly. <br><br>  And the second bad news is Chrome.  More precisely, in fact, this browser - the news is good, only for a long time is not news.  But the fact that it overtakes Opera in the voting for the desktop browser - that is why it is in vain.  After all, the young still need to learn a lot from the time-tested old-timers, and it‚Äôs really worthless to climb ahead of the older comrades out of turn.  So here you can <a href="http://browsers.about.com/od/allaboutwebbrowsers/ss/2011-readers-choice-awards-web-browsers-voting_2.htm%26poll_id%3D7209738706%26poll%3D4%26submit1%3DSubmit%2520Vote">correct the</a> situation. <br><br>  With the other categories, somehow everything is suspiciously calm, but it would not hurt to vote too - just in case.  The whole venture ends exactly on Women's Day - March 8, so we have a few days to make our contribution to the common voice business.
