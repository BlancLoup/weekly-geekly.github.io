    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Training </h4><br>  It all started on July 11, when XMs sent me the following email: <br><br><blockquote>  Greetings, I am from MLUG (Gentushnik with glasses).  In two months, the day of the ACT, during which it is supposed to agitate and propagate the ideals thereof, will be held.  Does Flanta plan, or anyone else to do something like that? <br></blockquote><br><br>  From this moment we began a long and leisurely discussion of the format of the event.  They agreed on the main thing: to do another half-closed sacrament for their own is not as cool as organizing something ‚Äúfundamentally new‚Äù, and not only in the sense of desktop wallpaper.  I wanted to create an event that ordinary people will pay attention to, and not just the same community.  Then followed the long-awaited vacation ... <br><br>  In general, in the second half of August, we with colleagues from the friendly ‚ÄúFlant‚Äù companies (Yuri Tatarsky from Progressive Operating Systems and Cyril Lebedev from POWERCOMP) met with Pavel Rassudov, the leader of the Pirate Party of Russia, at which they discussed possible cooperation in matters promotion of free software in Russia.  Along the way, the topic of Software Freedom Day surfaced, and Pavel immediately suggested: ‚Äú <b>Let's organize a rally!</b>  ".  At first, we were skeptical - after all, meetings are now perceived solely as a political action ... But in the course of further discussion, we came to an exemplary vision of how everything can be done. <br><br>  A long and very active discussion followed.  Let me just say that during the preparation of the event, only in my mailbox turned out to be <b>more than 350 incoming letters</b> on this topic.  They tried to contact the regions to hold mass meetings in Russia, but the reaction turned out to be rather sluggish (there was a fear of doing something like that and a lack of understanding why and why exactly). <br><br>  Well, okay, <b>what happened with us?</b> <br><br><h4>  Event </h4><br>  As a result, we received a go-ahead from the authorities to hold a rally in Novopushkinsky Square <i>(the application was submitted for several places in the center, the mayor‚Äôs office itself approves the final site)</i> in order to ‚Äú <b>express citizenship to the source code of the software</b> ‚Äù and the number of participants is up to 100 people.  Not so much, of course, but due to the sudden proximity of the March of Millions, we were more afraid for safety at the event (the emergence of provocateurs, conflict of interests, oversizing, etc.).  And, despite our initial goals, this has become a higher priority.  Fortunately, the police reacted with understanding and did everything to avoid any unpleasant situations.  True, we can say that she even overdid it a bit with this: we were so shielded from all sides that many passersby were afraid to go inside and looked only from the side.  Although this circumstance did not prevent the more courageous fellow citizens - for example, we were visited by residents of this area who saw some kind of motion through the window and specifically went out to see what was happening in close proximity to the scene. <br><br>  The event itself was organized as follows: <br><br><ul><li>  At the entrance there is a <b>table with all kinds of handouts</b> : disks with Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Russian Fedora, ROSA Marathon), brochures (common for free software and one more specifically for Ubuntu), magazines and Linux Format disks (kindly provided by GNU / LinuxCenter ) and all sorts of stuff (for example, badges from the Russian Fedora community).  Nearby were people who explained to passersby that they should take all this on trial and what is happening here in general. </li><li>  The <b>stage</b> was rented (and audio equipment).  The stage was decorated with the official attributes of Software Freedom Day and additional balls. </li><li>  <b>Professional actors</b> were invited and <b>a mini-series script</b> about computer service was written.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe series was reduced to an ironic demonstration of the problems faced by users of proprietary software.  Of course, free software was offered as a solution to these problems.  Screenwriter - <a href="http://www.kino-teatr.ru/kino/director/ros/6336/bio/">Alexei Serebrennikov</a> (he used plot ideas prepared by the organizers).  Actors - <a href="http://www.kino-teatr.ru/kino/acter/m/ros/10971/bio/">Nikolay Korobov</a> and <a href="http://www.kino-teatr.ru/kino/acter/w/ros/233254/bio/">Julia Galina</a> . </li><li>  Scenes from the actors were shown in between <b>performances</b> .  Presentations were made by the organizers themselves and representatives of the Russian-language open source software community.  Their duration was minimal (5 minutes), so as not to make everyone bored (we don‚Äôt have a conference for our own).  <b>List of reports</b> : <br><ol><li>  <b>Yury Tatarsky</b> (Progressive Operating Systems).  ‚Äú <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DqCzTYBS3JFA%26feature%3Dplcp">Greetings.</a>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DqCzTYBS3JFA%26feature%3Dplcp">On the holiday, the organizers, the speakers</a> .

It is important to understand that ‚Äúpirates‚Äù are not at all those pirates about which stereotypes are composed.  You can verify this, for example, in the <a href="http://pirate-party.ru/node/5">declaration of the goals of the outage</a> .  In the report, Pavel asked to stop calling the ‚Äúpirates‚Äù vinduzyatniki - a significant part of party members use free software, and also noted that ‚Äúif you are not involved in politics, then the policy will deal with you‚Äù. </li><li>  <b>EQuivalent</b> ( <b>MLUG</b> ).  ‚Äú <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D3P5z_K0nQKc%26feature%3Dplcp">On the freedom of software.</a>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D3P5z_K0nQKc%26feature%3Dplcp">Do your programs belong to you?</a>  ". </li><li>  <b>XMs</b> ( <b>MLUG</b> ).

" <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DCCi5JKyseX4%26feature%3Dplcp">The success of open source software in science</a> ."  It sounds scary for the masses, but the author tried to show (voice) real examples of the successful use of free software in scientific circles. </li><li>  <b>Dmitry</b> Screw (Flant).  ‚Äú <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dz_sLHbMANzM%26feature%3Dplcp">So why free software?</a>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dz_sLHbMANzM%26feature%3Dplcp">Philosophy, practice, business</a> . ‚Äù </li><li>  <b>Mikhail Shigorin</b> (ALT Linux Team, Ukraine).  Different Linux systems.  We did not plan this performance.  Mikhail appeared at the stage by the middle of the event and looked at me inquiringly: ‚ÄúScrews?‚Äù.  The last time we saw him at LinuxFest was 5 years ago.  It turned out that he is now in Moscow in view of the business trip.  He offered to join the ranks of the speakers - we gave the go-ahead without any hesitation. </li></ol><br></li><li>  "Pirates", as experienced protesters, dragged a bunch of flags and posters.  However, the community also tried with funny posters (see below). </li><li>  All the action was accompanied by music selected by us from <a href="http://jamendo.com/">Jamendo</a> specifically for the event. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Little photo </h4><br><h5>  General, organizers </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/df1/e34/4a8/df1e344a8b50fad5b8245cdd27ef6a6a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/377/1e9/15f/3771e915f022f60e1646fd54bb3a13b2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a1/e67/a0e/4a1e67a0edbca0eeb4eaf353fde5cb58.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/30f/7e1/36d/30f7e136d8a77dc94df7c346cf1e37fd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6a9/347/4cb/6a93474cb163955c694b2302a8d52f08.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Actors </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/715/5bb/d61/7155bbd61f7187a959c4b46b5d29b841.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee4/6af/47a/ee46af47a1c3eb7add5f1149f4f0d392.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Posters </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b4/242/419/6b4242419d717cc9262b161156dc3f08.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/31f/4ec/d4c/31f4ecd4ce4e7021c92bfebbf6982a37.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/adc/5ec/efc/adc5ecefc2f6c8a90d0d358f242e4a5f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/51e/84c/d77/51e84cd77fb7d7e878110915673d3e77.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/356/af6/9e2/356af69e2c873a8b45f87a5e70b92f64.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/067/a5b/2b8/067a5b2b8478d13673a439c5b21897b4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Visitors </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ad/822/723/3ad82272342c2f519971e58bcd105960.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a4/c33/8e1/3a4c338e174d332db9161fc9cfe8bcdc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c9b/920/9ff/c9b9209ffe301a188c1699ccd5d4ca50.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/697/c75/fbc/697c75fbccb36549c6afe843d711ff84.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/da7/3c5/8f7/da73c58f7a30dbb8c200c432b17f98d3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/175/b60/87b/175b6087bb4ce40baa0b3be6ef80062d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/255/ed6/1e4/255ed61e4b707fafa6818b6ab590e6e7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/236/e0c/759/236e0c759dd4f430186efbb85580022a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Still? </h5><br>  More photos can be found in the <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/1/events/c9v6je0g7lovaoja7sb6ja8nel8">event on Google+</a> and on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/%3Fset%3Da.509095409117842.125748.100000521615213%26type%3D1">Facebook</a> . <br><br><h4>  Video! </h4><br>  General cutting, greeting, reading resolution, several interviews after the rally: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/XBBHaEpUebE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgteD_NUfFXAIJTpTz3w7QqP-iHiQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Links to individual speeches, see above. <br><br>  Series (in progress): <br><ol><li>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DM8WBHqq6lE4%26feature%3Dchannel%26list%3DUL">1 episode, ‚ÄúHam Tram‚Äù</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DH2tEyYjO-7w%26feature%3Dchannel%26list%3DUL">2 series, "Conversation with a maniac"</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D-Onjt13HpYw%26feature%3Dchannel%26list%3DUL">3 series, "Grabber"</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DRW0EFsiU52w%26feature%3Dchannel%26list%3DUL">4 series, "I agree to Ubuntu"</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DufYF7FEp6mI%26feature%3Dchannel%26list%3DUL">5 series, ‚ÄúMany options‚Äù</a> </li></ol><br><br><h4>  Right after </h4><br>  After the event, enthusiasts from MLUG (dr.

Let me remind you that we tried to make an event addressed not only to the community, but also to ordinary people.  In this regard, we will be glad to any support of the community for the dissemination of information about what happened to a wide audience.  For the good of all :-) Thanks to everyone who came, helped and supported, and see you soon! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151846/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151846/</a></p>
