  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Turn your iPod Touch into an iPhone</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  iPhone and iPod Touch are two devices that are visually extremely difficult to distinguish from each other.  However, you can call from an iPhone, and if you are an iPod, then you are deprived of this opportunity.  For the opportunity to make calls, you will have to put an extra $ 100 in the Apple piggy bank plus at least $ 60 / month to pay AT &amp; T for the next two years.  You will save yourself from these costs if you purchase iPod touch, but you don‚Äôt know how to make calls.  You are mistaken - is able.  Today I will tell you how to use VoIP-telephony from your iPod Touch and iPhone with the help of a free application whose name is SIP-VoIP. <br><br><img src="http://www.lifehacker.com/assets/resources/2008/04/iphone-itouch-head.png" height="235" width="494"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  For this you will need: <br><ol><li>  Unlocked Jail iPod touch or iPhone.  If your device is not yet unlocked, do not worry, it will take no more than 45 seconds. </li><li>  Headphones with a microphone from the iPhone with the iPod Touch will not work.  Thus, if you are using iPod touch, you will have to use the Touchmod microphone.  There are a lot of such devices: from simple microphones that connect to the iPod touch through the service connector to integrated into the headphones (almost identical to those used in the iPhone).  Such a microphone will cost you about $ 50- $ 60. </li><li>  Free SIP-VoIP application.  How to install SIP-VoIP, see below. </li></ol>

    <img src="http://www.lifehacker.com/assets/resources/2008/04/touchmod-mic.png" alt="iPod" height="240" width="305"><br><br>  <strong>Note:</strong> On April 15, the Fring program appeared - another VoIP application for the iPhone.  According to the developers, Fring works with both Skype and SIP accounts.  Like SIP-VoIP, this application is still too young and does not yet claim to be a flawless product.  I was not able to test Fring, but I think that it will be a worthy competitor to SIP-VoIP, in addition, the program is very easy to install. <br><br>  <strong>SIP-VoIP Installation</strong> <br><br>  Suppose you already have a microphone and an unlocked iPod touch.  It's time to install a VoIP application.  Even if you do not have a microphone yet, then you can still check the performance of SIP-VoIP. <br><br>  I will talk about two different ways to install SIP-VoIP.  The first and easiest method is using Installer.app, a program that automatically installs when you unlock an iPod.  The second method is a bit more complicated, but it also needs to be studied in case something goes wrong (which is what happened to me). <br><br>  <strong>I. Method of installing SIP-VoIP (using Installer.app):</strong> To begin with, if by default installer.app is not detected in SIP-VoIP, you will need to add a Touchmods repository to Installer.  To do this, run the Installer and go to the Sources tab.  Then we execute Edit -&gt; Add and in the opened dialog enter <a href="">touchmods.net/rep.xml</a> .  Click OK, after that the Installer will update your resources, this time, adding to them Touchmods-repository. <br><br><img src="http://www.lifehacker.com/assets/resources/2008/04/touchmod-source1.jpg" height="189" width="200"><br><br>  Now go to the Install tab, find the Touchmods login icon there.  Inside you will find an application called Touchmods SIP-VoIP.  Install SIP-VoIP by clicking first on the arrow, then on the install button.  We confirm that you really want to install the application from an unreliable source. <br><br><img src="http://www.lifehacker.com/assets/resources/2008/04/touchmod-install-11.png" height="128" width="200"><br><br>  This is probably the easiest way to install SIP-VoIP.  However, my iPod touch did not accept the latest version of SIP-VoIP (version 1.2), so I had to roll back to version 1.1.  And despite the fact that the probability of installing the latest version of Installer is great, I still describe the method of installing earlier versions of SIP-VoIP.  Of course, I would advise you first to try the first way, and resort to the second only if you have problems with the first.  If you are installing the first way for the first time, then skip the chapter ‚ÄúInstalling a SIP Account‚Äù. <br><br>  <strong>Ii.</strong>  <strong>SIP-VoIP installation method (via SSH):</strong> In order to install an earlier version of SIP-VoIP, you first need to install OpenSSH using Install.app (you will find it by running Install -&gt; System).  Now you need to connect to your iPod from a computer using an FTP client with SFTP support (for example, FileZilla for Windows and Cyberduck for OS X).  This action will allow you to view and copy files to your iPod, just as if you were performing the same operations on a computer's hard disk. <br><br>  In order to connect to a computer, you need to know the IP address of your iPod touch or iPhone.  Open Settings, select Wi-Fi, click on the blue arrow, it will lead you to the network to which you are connected. <br><br><img src="http://www.lifehacker.com/assets/resources/2008/04/iphone-ip.jpg" height="110" width="250"><br><br>  Now that everything is ready, we start an FTP client on the computer, specify the received IP address as the server, the username root, the password alpine.  Once the connection is established, go to the Applications folder (right below the root folder).  It is there that all installed applications are stored in iPod touch and iPhone.  Now you can remove or install the necessary version of the application by dragging and dropping into or out of the Applications folder. <br><br><img src="http://www.lifehacker.com/assets/resources/2008/04/filezilla-iphone.png" height="166" width="194"><br><br>  When writing this article, I used SIP-VoIP version 1.1, it can be found on the Internet.  Simply unzip the zip archive and drag the SIP-VoIP.app file into the Applications folder.  Finally, restart your iPod or iPhone.  A new application will appear on your desktop. <br><br>  <strong>SIP account creation</strong> <br><br>  Unfortunately, SIP-VoIP does not work with the most popular VoIP-application Skype, because  connection occurs via SIP protocol.  It is assumed that you have a registered account of another service, and when working with the program you will use it.  Fortunately, services for working with SIP-VoIP in bulk.  I preferred FreeCall, so I‚Äôll build on it, but you can find a list of alternative servers on the Touchmods blog. <br><br>  If you stick to my settings, go to the FreeCall registration page and create an account for yourself.  After the account is successfully created, you need to purchase a few minutes so that you can make calls.  FreeCall is an international service, so when answering a request for the number of your mobile phone to which an SMS notification will be sent, you must also enter the code of the country where you are located.  For example, if you are in the US, the number would look something like this: 0015555551234. The minimum payment amount is 10 euros, approximately $ 16.  As soon as you have acquired a few minutes of FreeCall airtime, you can proceed to setting up SIP-VoIP and directly to the calls themselves. <br><br>  Note: If you do not want to pay money right now, then use services such as Gismo5 (in the past Gismo Project), they provide a certain number of free minutes <br><br>  <strong>Setting up SIP-VoIP for making calls</strong> <br><br>  Finally, we are ready to configure SIP-VoIP for the SIP operator you have chosen.  Run the application on the iPhone or iPod tiuch, then go to the Settings tab (button in the lower right corner).  A very simple form will appear, in which you need to enter data about the account that you have previously registered. <br><br><img src="http://www.lifehacker.com/assets/resources/2008/04/sip-setup.jpg" height="117" width="200"><br><br>  If you, like me, use FreeCall, then enter the FreeCall username and password in the first 2 fields (when using other services, enter the number obtained during registration in the ‚Äúusername‚Äù field), enter the sip address in the SIP-Server field. voiparound.com (see screenshot).  There may be other fields to fill out, but for FreeCall these are enough.  Click Save to save the settings - on the iPod, you can simply press the ‚Äúreturn‚Äù button and you will be prompted to save the settings - then call the dial pad. <br><br><img src="http://www.lifehacker.com/assets/resources/2008/04/sip-voip-dialpad.jpg" height="299" width="200"><br><br>  Before you make your first call, you need to connect to SIP North.  To do this, select ‚ÄúConnect to SIP-server‚Äù (button in the lower left corner).  If everything goes as it should, then the connection to the server will be successful.  (It was at this stage that I had some problems with version 1.2 on iPod touch. The IPhone connected to the server without any problems, but iPod touch completely refused to establish a connection. If you encounter the same difficulties, installing version 1.1 should help.) Once the connection is established, all that is required of you to make a call is to simply dial the number (when using some services, it is not necessary to enter the country code) and press the call button. <br><br>  <strong>We register the incoming number</strong> <br><br>  FreeCall account allows you to make outgoing calls only.  But there is an opportunity to teach iPod touch to receive calls as well.  You can use your SIP account in other systems (such as IPKall), which provide the ability to get an incoming connection number to your iPod touch.  (but there are pitfalls: your number will be tied to the Washington state code).  I will not delve into the registration procedure for the incoming number; you can get all the necessary information by reading this Touchmods blog post. <br><br>  SIP-VoIP has not been in development for a long time, and although the program is still quite raw, it looks like the application will be refined over time.  Sales of firmware version 2.0 for iPhone and iPod touch will officially begin sometime in June.  Apple promised to support third-party software developers.  Let's see what VoIP-applications will appear in the near future. <br><br>  You look, there will be Skype or some other official application for iPhone.  (Apple announced that the VoIP service will be implemented via Wi-Fi).  SIP-VoIP program has already been published.  In my work carried out in this area, I fully relied on luck.  It will take a long time when SIP-VoIP will become your favorite program.  But if you already want to make cheap international calls or just connect with the outside world using iPod touch, then you are welcome: the guys from Touchmods and SIP-VoIP have already provided you with this opportunity. <br><br>  Information from the site " <a href="http://appf15.ru/%3Fp%3D5">Apple is a way of life</a> " </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26886/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26886/</a></p>
