      This player (or maybe a voice recorder or a miniature tape recorder - I still don‚Äôt know what definition it fits more precisely) could play magnetic tapes through stereo headphones (supplied but not preserved) or the built-in mono speaker and record sound from the built-in stereo !) microphone or line-in. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/70a/dd0/463/70add046398811cea0aeb12db0c9e1c7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The controls are in order: ‚Äúrecord‚Äù, ‚Äúplay‚Äù, two rewind buttons, cassette ejection and pause.  The buttons were terribly tight.  To enable the recording mode, it was necessary to simultaneously press ‚Äúrecording‚Äù and ‚Äúplayback‚Äù.  I had to do a lot of effort for this. <br><br>  Unfortunately, with the inserted cassette I can not take a picture, - none has survived, but they took their place there: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/308/db1/e36/308db1e3619a02869788748f6e01a6e0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the photo below - the battery compartment and the container, which included 4 AA batteries. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/615/ad8/b6b/615ad8b6b4b403c40c3c73fca5ea7997.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/de9/2ea/c02/de92eac027ff6dd24a89f8a812b9ac9b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The device ate batteries with a big appetite, but they were not cheap.  Therefore, most of the time I listened to music at home by connecting the player through a network adapter, the connector for which you see on the right in the following photo: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c38/45f/295/c3845f2956de8e813a385034bf6727c8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Further from right to left: headphone jack - 3.5mm jack, line input - 3.5mm jack and volume control. <br><br>  Without going beyond the review of the player, there is nothing more to say.  It did not have a high-resolution color screen, Android OS and other gadgets that could be savored for a long time.  However, for its time, the device was very cool.  It had all the functions of an ordinary tape recorder, but at the same time it was very compact in size. <br><br>  I can not deny myself to share the memories that I have associated with it. <br>  I do not know what truths or not truths grandmother ‚Äúgot‚Äù this player in such difficult years, but thank her so much.  Music has come into my life, and this life has become better.  Included was a cassette <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mio_in_the_Land_of_Faraway">Mio in the Land of Faraway - OST</a> .  Wearing headphones and turning on the music, I, sorry for the vulgarity, ofigel.  This was the first time I heard a stereo sound.  Until that moment, I did not suspect that sound could have volume. <br>  I recorded ‚Äúopenengi‚Äù from Disney cartoons, which DH showed on weekends and listened to them on weekdays, to this tape recorder.  On school fires, I ‚Äúinterviewed‚Äù teachers and classmates that we, with a respected <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/sil1999/" class="user_link">sil1999,</a> then mounted and presented to the strict court of the public. <br><br>  Ps. <br>  I tried to insert batteries - the player buzzes, but the cassette does not twist.  I suspect that the Pasiki have died.  Since this device is now immortalized on Habr√©, I will gladly give it to the person who will take it to reanimate. <br><br>  UP.  The stereo recorder has found its future owner. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117711/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117711/</a></p>
