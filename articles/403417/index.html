  <section class="page js-page"><h1>My salvation: a tour of Coworking 14</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The night mingled with the day, dozens of meetings, thousands of kilometers of flights.  I wonder if I guess the city in which I wake up now?  I didn‚Äôt guess - I‚Äôm on the plane again, flying somewhere between Tyumen and Moscow.  Developing my own business, I finally stopped sitting in one place.  In the literal and figurative sense. <br><br>  Not so long ago, while working in an office in 5/2 mode, I dreamed of my own business.  As it seemed to me, my business will give me freedom, independence and more free time.  If you also dream about it, I will say straight away: I did not receive any of the above.  But at the same time, not a bit sorry about leaving a hired job. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/coworking14/blog/288388/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/75f/d55/efc/75fd55efce45fbb511d614dbf5d70555.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When you start your business, you encounter problems that you did not pay attention to when working for hire.  The very first and most relevant - and where to actually work?  It is inconvenient and impossible to hold meetings at home, to rent an office is expensive, and a good office is even more expensive.  Therefore, I settled on a public workplace, co-working in a fashionable way.  Coworking 14.

      A taxi from Sheremetyevo takes me to Khimki in 15 minutes.  I would drive to the center for more than an hour - plus one point Coworking.  Why Khimki?  It is the most promising city in the Moscow region (except Moscow) according to the criteria for the development of small and medium-sized businesses.  People come from Krasnogorsk, Mitino and even Solnechnogorsk.  Now there are municipal co-working - people understand the benefits of this format of work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/28b/43a/15c/28b43a15ce68bf9ec8cfb43dbdfdcecf.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/54f/5a4/8a3/54f5a48a3a37826ede6ec5e1672cec23.jpg"><br><br>  When I first came to coworking, I didn‚Äôt ask the floor I was looking for with the anticipation of getting acquainted with the ‚Äúnew office‚Äù.  But by including the favorite method of Sherlock Holmes - deduction, he realized: Coworking 14 is on the 14th floor! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/334/2a0/df5/3342a0df5371e176b65504e37be47fc4.jpg"><br><br>  At the entrance and exit you need to be noted - so the system will understand who came or went. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4a8/c53/912/4a8c539123550daec4452bfc5946bfbc.jpg"><br><br>  The first and, perhaps, the most significant difference from the traditional offices where I have worked is space.  What is the area of ‚Äã‚Äãyour office?  30 square meters?  100?  I work in a 2000 meter room.  And I can navigate it all day. <br><br>  I check incoming mail at the workplace: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4b3/499/0f4/4b34990f4fc95a3f7e16fabae498935e.jpg"><br><br>  I communicate on Skype in isolated booths, so as not to interfere with colleagues <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b23/74a/670/b2374a6707472c88250aaf90546a6b68.jpg"><br><br>  I answer the letters while sitting on the stationary bike - the macbook is ideally suited for its holder (a coincidence? I don‚Äôt think!). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/74f/979/b30/74f979b3055c8b5c6a40b76af2639ec6.jpg"><br><br>  At first glance, the concept of coworking is paradoxical: you work in a crowd of people, but at the same time you feel alone.  Paradox?  But it works! <br><br>  So far, Coworking14 is still developing and there are few people, but already now the main trend of such sites is the collaboration, it is well practiced.  Why look for, for example, an accountant or HR at an outsourcing, when both are sitting at the next table?  This neighborhood gives rise to a long-forgotten feeling of a common cause.  And it is beautiful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a26/888/a8d/a26888a8d994fa652b5e318a1c82c3de.jpg"><br><br>  The creators of Coworking14 did everything so that the guests (that‚Äôs what the clients call here, because co-working becomes their second home) as much time as possible and spent in their workplace with as much comfort as possible.  Tuesday evening, for example, is proposed to be held on free English courses for residents.  In addition, K14 has two business clubs where residents disassemble each other‚Äôs cases and share their experiences.  A great reason to stay in the office! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c78/b01/507/c78b01507cfee21abb6f43dd5741da13.jpg"><br><br>  Very soon there will open its cafe, but now you can order breakfast, and lunch delivers a cafe nearby.  Although zealous startups prefer to bring food with them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/375/36b/dbb/37536bdbb3e684b42fc281ec19e46dc0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/563/7ee/bec/5637eebecf0ed14210453857fa461839.jpg"><br><br>  To feed the brain with glucose provides a snack bar.  A curious detail: the bar is not controlled in any way (the camera does not count) - the guests themselves pay for their purchases at the reception.  For all the work of coworking, there has not been a single case of non-payment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/68b/b54/5d0/68bb545d01e32884c1ee3756de1f42b3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af9/f17/f5e/af9f17f5edbe3c36257ace9b9334d145.jpg"><br><br>  We all know the situation when you are late in the office so much that going home, if not pointless, then certainly not feeling good.  Especially for such Stakhanovists, a capsule hotel is working in coworking.  There are only 6 rooms in it and in order to book an overnight stay - you need to try.  Places are often occupied. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/edd/015/143/edd015143cd604ffa8616eeedcc30fc4.jpg"><br><br>  Employees of K14, not without pride, say that in summer the whole family stayed with them: the girl and her parents came to enter the university.  While yesterday's graduate took exams, her parents worked in coworking. <br><br>  And another citizen did not go out on the street for three months and did not feel any discomfort. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/07a/d28/ce1/07ad28ce1d890446ca73a7a69b7f0327.jpg"><br><br>  In general, it is possible to live, but to work in general is wonderful! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403417/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403417/</a></p>
