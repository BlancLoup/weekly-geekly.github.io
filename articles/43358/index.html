A friend on Habr√© is only with read only rights, but believes in a bright future. <br><br>  Having read a small cart of various kinds of literature about the ascents of the stars of the IT industry, and being inspired by interesting and not very stories about the success stories of our modern luminaries, I took up studying (well, how to say study, interest in my free time <s>picking my nose</s> ) biography Steve Jobs.  No, not because today cries with sometimes very, very harsh swearing infinitely pouring on the heads of representatives of the Yablochnik families, or their no less tough opponents, have become such obsessive, not at all true. <br>  After reviewing a couple of lines, I had a double impression.  Some said that Jobs did not know how to make a creature exploiting the priceless work of their naive subordinates, while others shouted that Steve is a genius, almost a Messiah.  This incident made me go deep into the jungle of the dictionary and into the truly scary forums of evil fat bearded uncles issued to me by omniscient search engines. <br>  Do not kick me if the information for you turns out to be accordion-like, I really write for those who, like me, knew practically nothing about Steve.  I will try to write with theses so as not to delve into the nuances and chronology. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <b>Theses:</b>

      - Steven Jobs was born February 24, 1954 in the city of San Francisco, California.  The mother of the newborn John Dow, due to her not very stable material condition and in some historical events (at that time young women who did not formally marry did not officially have the right to raise children) was forced to give their children to the legal couple, Paul and Clara Jobs who could not have children for a long time. <br>  - Mona Sipson is the only biological sister of Steve Jobs about the existence of which he learned after three decades.  Mona was born two years after Steve was born, when their parents formalized the marriage.  Mona is a writer publicist.  Contrary to all opinions, they maintain a good relationship.  It is rumored that many of her books were written not without the influence of her brother‚Äôs charisma on her, and some based on her biography. <br>  - Steve Jobs's first child - Lisa Nicole, was born on May 17, 1978, as the apogee of the novel with Chris-Ann.  For a very long time, he refused to recognize paternity, but nonetheless called her by the name of one of his projects bearing the code name 'Lisa'. <br>  - Stephen is a Buddhist.  And they say exactly the history of his pilgrimage to India, where he was confronted with all the pleasures of the lifestyle of the local inhabitants, became a turning point in his life. <br>  - Jobs is not the original inventor of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a device that has become the prototype of Arrl 1. This machine was shown to him by friends in his youth. <br>  - Projects in chronological order: Apple 1, Apple 2 (a truly successful project with many modifications), Lisa, Macintosh, NeXT (which failed miserably), Apple 3. <br>  - Why Apple?  Because Arrle in the phone directory is higher than Atari :) And because it sounds easy and unobtrusive.  There is a theory that inspired his stay at the 'Back to the Earth' movement held on apple farms in Origone. <br>  - Why Macintosh?  This is Jobs' favorite apple variety :).  But when he wrote the name of the project in the documents - was wrong.  (Initially, the apple variety is Mcintosh, Mc / Mac) But after some time, it was no longer Steve's project that was confused with apples, but vice versa. <br>  - Why is Pixar?  From Pixel art. <br>  -Remember the toy on Tetris where you need to beat the ball to break the wall?  No, it was not Jobs who invented it, but it was he who first realized it. <br>  <b>Common myths and real facts:</b> <br><br>  The most successful projects of Steve Jobs: <br>  Apple 2, Macintosh, iPod, Pixar, iTunes, iPhone <br><br>  The most unsuccessful, failed projects: <br>  Apple 1, Lisa, NeXT, Apple 3 <br><br>  - Steve sat several times on the top of the lists of the most hated directors in the press. <br>  - At 24, he sold part of the shares of Arrl√© and earned the first million.  A year later - the first 10 million.  A little later - 100. <br>  - Great <s>combinator</s> animator. <br>  I think everyone heard about such animated tapes as Toy Story, Finding Nemo? .. I think many people know that these are Pixar products.  Most of the ear has heard that this company came to life with the light hand of Steve.  Having bought a company going to the bottom, which was founded by amateur pioneers of animation, concluded a contract with such a arrogance with such a monster as Disney, after less than 5 years, created a company such as we can see it today. <br><br>  Steve can not be called the most intelligent, he can not be called the most talented.  But with an explosive combination of qualities of an extremely courageous and charismatic person, not without some kind of charm inspired by his image, he did his job.  He became a man "against".  Those who "think differently." <br>  Perhaps one of the main roles in the formation of his image was played by his amazing ability to keep the public in constant tension.  There are really few such people.  On bare improvisation, he is able to keep you waiting for something beyond one hour, and even in the thousandth audience to give the feeling that he is talking to you. <br>  It's hard to say exactly what made him such an excellent speaker.  It is impossible to say boldly that these are genes, since he was adopted, it is even harder to say that this is an education that was sometimes not very easy.  So the easiest way to write it all off is talent. <br>  Exceptional willpower, and the absence of any fear that could make him stop trying to return to Olympus after the crash and exile for many years from Arrl√© - these qualities served as the starting point for the formation of the personality of Steve Jobs.  Thinking person otherwise. <br><br>  Do not rush to call me a fanatic, the only product that I have associated with the activities of l is a pair of headphones.  I wrote as objectively as possible, being under the impression not of what Steve created, but under the impression of what kind of person he is.
