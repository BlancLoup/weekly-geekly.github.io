I do not want to look stupid, asking the wrong questions.  I do not want to overload their client.  But if you do not ask all the necessary questions, you can waste your time on developing in the wrong direction. <br><br>  Therefore, as a base, I specifically developed for you a survey of 55 questions.  Keep in mind the following: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      - please use these ideas.  I believe that knowing the right questions is a key step in creating a logo. <br><br>  - I do not insist that you should ask absolutely all these questions to any client.  Do not complicate, but do not forget about the main things. <br><br>  - Use these questions as basic.  Perhaps over time you will find more correct questions. <br><br>  I divided them into 5 categories - organizational, brand, design preferences, target audience, budget + deadlines and testing. <br><br><h4>  Organizational </h4><br>  Think about what you need to know about the company or organization for which you are developing a logo.  For example: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  - what makes your company different from the rest? <br>  - what products or services do you provide? <br>  - Why should I choose you, not your competitors? <br>  - how long does the company work? <br>  - company size (number of employees / income) <br>  - strengths and weaknesses of the company? <br>  - How do you see your company in 5, 10, 50 years? <br>  - who is your main competitor? <br>  - why was your company founded? <br>  - what prompted you to start this business? <br><br><h4>  Branding </h4><br>  When designing a logo, it is necessary to ask questions not only about the logo itself, but also about the brand of the company as a whole, and about what image it has.  For example: <br><br>  - describe your company in one word <br>  - how could your customers describe your company in one word? <br>  - how does the company position itself? <br>  - Do you have a motto or slogan to be included in the logo? <br>  - What would you like your company to become famous for? <br>  - What do your customers think when they see your logo for the first time? <br>  - why are you using exactly the colors and fonts that you use? <br>  - Do you have a logo now?  If yes: <br>  - what needs to be kept from the past logo? <br>  - why did you need to change the logo design? <br>  - how long have you had an old logo? <br><br><h4>  Design preferences </h4><br>  If you have ever had a client who cannot clearly explain what he likes and doesn't like, ask him the following questions in order to determine his taste: <br><br>  - what palettes do you like and why? <br>  - where will the logo be used primarily? <br>  - Do you need any specific elements in the logo? <br>  - what do you think defines a well-made logo? <br>  - what icons, typography, etc.  you prefer? <br>  - what restrictions are imposed on the logo? <br>  - what words or images need to be included in the logo? <br>  - what logos do you like? <br>  - what logos you do not like, and why? <br>  - what do you think is the main purpose of the logo? <br>  - in what cases is this logo most likely to be used? <br><br><h4>  The target audience </h4><br>  Do not forget to clarify the target audience.  A smart client will prefer what clients like, not him. <br><br>  - What is your target audience, who will most likely use your service or product? <br>  - who uses your product more often now? <br>  - Are you satisfied with the reach of your audience? <br>  - Do you want to expand, change or completely change the audience? <br>  - How do you plan to focus on your audience? <br>  - how do you most often advertise? <br>  - How do most customers find your company? <br>  - what floor are you targeting? <br>  - Where do most of your clients live? <br>  - What is the average income of your audience? <br><br><h4>  Budget and timeline </h4><br>  Of course, it is imperative to find out issues related to the budget deadlines. <br><br>  - How much money do you plan to spend on logo design? <br>  - Is there a deadline?  <i>[approx.</i>  <i>trans.</i>  <i>- in my opinion, these two questions should be asked right away]</i> <br>  - how many options do you plan to consider? <br>  - How many initial options would you like to see? <br>  - Do I need to make any changes in the future? <br>  - why did you choose my design company for logo design? <br>  - more importantly - quality, speed or cost?  <i>[approx.</i>  <i>trans.</i>  <i>- you can select 2 points ...]</i> <br>  - Are there any events or campaigns that depend on the development of this logo? <br>  - will you need any other services besides logo design? <br><br>  Additional questions (additional income) <br><br>  - do you need anything else to design? <br>  - Do you need help in determining your target audience, or any other advice? <br>  - Do you know any other companies that need a new logo? <br><br>  What questions did you come up with according to your work experience? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/256901/">https://habr.com/ru/post/256901/</a></p>
