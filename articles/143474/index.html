In these articles I gutted the game from all points of view, but did not really tell what game it was. <br>  These articles are: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/142490/">The way of independent developers on the example of a game that they do not promote in an article with a complex and abstract name about the way of independent ...</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/142884/">Technical preparation of one game created by independent developers</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/143396/">Monetization and promotion of the game from independent developers</a> </li></ul><br>  I admit, I saved my karma for the ‚ÄúI'm a PR!‚Äù Blog, but I didn‚Äôt save it.  But still I want to submit the game itself.  I think that it will be correct, for I have opened the technical details interesting for Habr earlier. <br>  Now about the game itself.  I warn you that there will be Ad and Israel under the cut, a huge amount of blood and violence.  Below you will not see a drop of morality, moralizing, and, perhaps, common sense.  I warned you. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  The essence </h5><br>  The game is called " <a href="http://vk.com/app2635482">Bloody Gebnya against the Legion of Anonymous</a> ".  This is a game for social networks.  Game genre - network massfighting.  By massfighting, we mean a battle in which a large number of units crush each other, and the meaning of a player‚Äôs action comes down to the generation of fighters.  The game mixed the mechanics of the magic of gathering games, zombies against plants, and even starcraft;  tower defense genres and massively multiplayer online.  Blood, guts and memes are the first signs of the game. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f97/ea9/9be/f97ea99be9a3ca014dcf57137bdb3403.jpg">

    <h5>  The battle </h5><br>  The player can fight with another person in a battle in real time.  His army is a deck of cards, where each card corresponds to a warrior-meme or a politician.  Participation of the player in the battle is limited to laying out or removing the card.  Each laid out card periodically gives birth to a warrior who is already running to kill enemy fighters without a player.  The goal of the battle is to destroy the enemy‚Äôs bunker.  The fight is the main advantage and the culmination of the game.  It is in it at the same time a rod on each other up to 200 units at the same time, filling the location with blood.  Each hit in the unit is accompanied by a spray of blood of a huge radius. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e74/446/255/e74446255a643a7fb32b520da5c3dba6.jpg"><br><br><br><h5>  Preparation for battle </h5><br>  If the battle is the culmination of the game, then the road of preparation and formation of the deck goes to it.  The player is invited to assemble his own army of Internet memes or famous politicians.  21 memes fight for the Legion and 21 fighters steal and kill for the Bloody Gebnya.  The player will take one of the parties and form an army.  Cards with fighters can and should be bought for game currency, replenishing their army.  Each card gains experience and can be pumped.  And having pasted a mark on it, the fighter will receive a special skill.  Among the characters are Putin, Surkov, Sobchak, Boyarsky, trollface, pepyakomen, kote, onotole, leonide and anonymus.  All warriors are divided into 6 races: political politics, oligarchs, showbiz, feys, upyachki military men, beatards.  Races do not affect the characteristics of the cards, divide them only logically.  By strength, cards are divided into three types: simple, hardcore and epic. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/160/a88/b8d/160a88b8d933e2ac04fbecd8e5491a36.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Maps or warriors </h5><br>  Each card has its own characteristics.  These are health, attack power, armor, movement speed, attack radius and projectile impact area.  This variation allows you to use different tactics to achieve victory.  For example, now tactics have proven themselves well, when a long-range fighter ‚Äúide‚Äù is released, who hits the square.  Enough to restrain the enemy in battles at a safe distance from the ide, and they will accumulate and turn into a formidable force. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/886/dbe/f10/886dbef1050ba18c7fe670a0c917dbe9.png"><br><br><h5>  Stamps </h5><br>  Each card has three brand slots, one of which is immediately occupied by the base mark.  Having pasted the mark on the card, the fighter acquires a special skill.  Often this skill against a particular race of warriors.  Thus, it is possible to adapt to a specific enemy, exposing warriors with marks acting against the prevailing races of the enemy. <br>  In addition to fighting with real opponents, the player can gain experience in quests.  Now there are 4 quests: Sparta, Bobruisk, Ostankino and the Kremlin.  The meaning of the quest is simple - this is a normal battle against the computer in different locations.  Each quest has 10 levels of difficulty.  The complexity of the quest depends on the deck of a computer, a set of its cards and the level of each card. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9f8/46f/07b/9f846f07b5ef659b6a47cffb67f4b6a4.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Ranks </h5><br>  The player has two ranks at the same time: for gebniu and for legion.  The higher the difference in titles between the two factions, the more pronounced and distinctly belonging to one of the factions.  But you can play a double agent, developing for both factions.  The title is stuffed in quests.  Winning the soldiers of gebni, the player gets points and rank for the legion, losing slightly for gebnya, and vice versa.  A total of 11 ranks for each faction, ranging from junior lieutenant to admiral (naval ranks) for the legion and from junior lieutenant to general (army ranks) for gebni.  Raising his rank, the player opens to buy a card better in the store. <br><br><h5>  Domestic currency </h5><br>  There are two currencies in the game: lave and hundreds of oil.  Currencies, by and large, are equal.  You can earn the first one by playing quests and winning battles.  And the second is Donat, it can only be bought for real money.  I want to note that the donate does not give any advantages in battle, but only allows you to quickly pump your deck.  Both currencies can be spent on the purchase of cards, brands, purchase of VIP status, pumping your bunker, forced pumping of cards in the laboratory. <br><br><br><h5>  In the rest </h5><br>  The main advantage of the game is the fight, where a bunch of memes and politicians will be crumbling to mince each other.  And for the rivers of blood, we will be precisely excommunicated.  It is here that you can tear apart Putin‚Äôs pieces, drown Kadyrov‚Äôs blood or de-troll.  And you can play <a href="http://vk.com/app2635482">here</a> . <br><br>  PS <br>  The music for the game was written by Madevil and AContrari, the authors of the cool remixes of memes ‚Äúbreak me completely‚Äù and ‚Äúide‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143474/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143474/</a></p>
