And then the question arose - what to listen to music on?  The first time, the phone came to the rescue, but since I am a little scattered and constantly forget to charge it, there is a risk to remain without communication.  I formulated my requirements for the player and went to choose.  So, get acquainted, <a href="">Treelogic Mini 4Gb</a> . <br>  Inside - a photo, the description and experience of use.  (traffic) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7e3/d59/7d8/7e3d597d87be014c7ecf59f15df50c2d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Requirements: </h4><br>  1. Memory capacity - from 4 Gb <br>  2. The minimum set of functions, just listening to music. <br>  3. Sufficient time from a single charge to last for a couple of days of listening on the road.  (considering my travel time) <br>  4. Low cost.

    <h4>  Selection: </h4><br>  Since I work not far from the Savyolovsky market, I directed my feet there.  At first there was a thought to buy some ‚Äúnoname-Chinese‚Äù, but the duration of their work was embarrassing.  Glancing around at the proposed range, I opted for the Treelogic Mini 4Gb. <br><br><h4>  Overview: </h4><br>  I will say right away, I gave for him a little less than 1,300 rubles.  Let's see what got in return. <br>  So, the player is a miniature plastic parallelepiped of black color, with soft-touch coating.  Player case is monolithic, without one facet.  The whole playback is occupied by 5 playback control keys - volume up, volume down, track back, power key, track forward. <br>  The power key is multi-function, it is responsible for turning the device on and off, as well as for starting the track and pause.  This is the only button on which the icon of the function is not printed, but cut through - behind this key is a red LED that indicates the modes of operation of the device.  But first things first. <br><br><h4>  Contents of delivery </h4><br>  The player comes in a transparent blister.  The package is slightly larger than the package of some earbud headphones. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e31/d1a/b3d/e31d1ab3d86f29f9d888e5346d8a8b4b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Inside the package is the player itself, a brief instruction manual, warranty card, USB-miniUSB cable and headphones. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a71/5aa/ab2/a715aaab2e77373a3aadf3a817fd2b68.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The packaging is functional, the cable and headphones are put away in the bottom ‚Äúbox‚Äù, the poster with the characteristics is expanded and is an instruction.  Those.  Having bought the player, you can remove the transparent plastic and just throw it away, everything else can easily fit in your pocket. <br>  The player is available in 4 colors - black, white, pink and blue.  All 4 options are made of soft coated plastic. <br>  The player has a miniUSB connector and supports USB 2.0 High Speed ‚Äã‚Äãdata transfer.  Battery capacity - 105 mA / h, which according to the manufacturer will allow you to enjoy music up to 10 hours.  Support formats: mp3, wma, wav. <br><br><h4>  Photos from different angles: </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/57e/cee/246/57ecee24600f82ae6b6a6c4ce2b5efa8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3ab/1fb/4f8/3ab1fb4f88a815446e6ad93694f7d473.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a59/d3b/31e/a59d3b31e98e9a38cdcdfbdc7ade454f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eeb/382/f3e/eeb382f3e9e4af03b7e8571061eeabcf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eae/d8f/327/eaed8f327a7e3ec913c4c3135334dc57.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f00/86d/61f/f0086d61f97cd3843f17c9a9fc0e7504.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/781/d68/2aa/781d682aa74851ac99b0d81dded89b2e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  InUse: </h4><br>  After the purchase, I immediately poured about 900 MB of music on the player and turned it on immediately, and began listening.  What can I say for use - the case with a soft-touch coating is very easily soiled, it is covered with fingerprints instantly.  On the black model, it is very striking.  Whether this is critical for you or not - decide for yourself, I plan to almost not get the device out of my pocket, so it doesn‚Äôt bother me much.  The volume of the player is quite sufficient for comfortable listening in transport, subject to the replacement of the complete headphones.  No, really, in any stall for 100 rubles "ears" are better sold.  Which is understandable - a budget model, so complete ears are needed for one thing - to check the player‚Äôs performance when buying and bring them to the ballot box. <br>  By the way, for the purpose of testing the player, 1 track was recorded on it, I had it Celine Dion - I`m alive.  I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs the same for everyone <br>  I‚Äôm not an audio maniac and basically listen to rock, punk rock and folk, so I don‚Äôt undertake to evaluate the sound quality and the set of frequencies to be played, but for my taste, the sound quality for the player in this price category is quite decent.  The target audience is most likely athletes (or just sports people) and children to whom parents give the first inexpensive player.  Well, and yet, music lovers are just as undemanding in terms of functionality as I am. <br>  As for the design of the player, it is a monolithic case, with control buttons on one of the faces and ports cut in the case for charging, data transfer and headphones.  I was puzzled by the hole for cutting the device, so I can't imagine to hang out there.  I first took this hole for fasteners for lace.  The buttons are pressed with a little effort, have tactile feedback and emit a distinct click when pressed, which allows you to touch the player.  When the track is switched, the playing track dies down, and the new one starts to play with increasing volume.  It is possible to enable the ‚Äúrepeat‚Äù and ‚Äúrandom track‚Äù modes by pressing a special combination of 2 control keys, each mode is notified by a light indicator by flashing a certain frequency for each of them. <br><br><h4>  Let's summarize a little: </h4><br><br>  + compact and lightweight player; <br>  + the price is minimal for a player of this size; <br>  + standard connectors for charging, data transfer and headphone connection (just stick your favorite headphones and listen); <br>  + sufficient duration of work from one charge; <br>  + ease of management; <br><br>  - Player Mark, very; <br>  - connectors are not covered with plugs; <br>  - Complete headphones are no good; <br>  - there is no any type of attachment of clothespins on clothes or a hole for a lace; <br>  - there is no navigation between folders (in any case, it is not mentioned in the instructions and I did not find it), switching only by track. <br><br>  Well, I have acquired a convenient simple player of decent volume for little money, now I will enjoy my favorite music on the road or while playing sports, the player is really weightless.  Whether this model is right for you is worth trying and deciding on your own.  And it is worth remembering that this is not second-hand or noname, but a branded new thing, which is guaranteed for 1 year. <br><br>  PS I have been listening to the factory charge for the third hour and the player is working so far, so there is hope that the declared 10 hours is true. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98494/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98494/</a></p>
