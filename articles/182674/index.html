On the tables are lying parts from dozens of disassembled devices.  A small team of young engineers examines the results of the electronic slaughter, carefully selecting credit card-sized motherboards ‚Äî the microprocessor hearts of most computers ‚Äî that will now be converted into satellite brains just a little larger than a baseball.  As a rule, the production and launch of a satellite is worth millions of dollars.  The cost of <a href="http://www.linux.com/news/embedded-mobile/mobile-linux/716910-android-and-linux-nanosats-shine-bright">Odyadomari nanosatellites</a> is about 15 thousand dollars and continues to decline.  He expects to make them available to schools, individual lovers and all those who want to set up scientific experiments in space. <br><br>  They are so small and cheap because they work on Android, the operating system from Google, which is familiar to all buyers of smartphones and tablets.  This is the most popular mobile OS, which left competitors far behind: in world sales, Android mobiles are 4 times ahead of Apple's iPhone.  But even such impressive numbers actually diminish the superiority of Android, because it is increasingly becoming the operating system for any device with a processor.  Along with the Odyadari <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8">nanosatellites</a> , three of which were recently launched into orbit, there are coffee makers, video consoles, <a href="http://army-news.ru/2012/12/tracking-point-vysokie-texnologii-v-snajpinge/">rifles that post video to Facebook</a> , and robotic combines for farmers on Android. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9b9/ef2/762/9b9ef27626cdf37814b152bbd6ce48ed.jpg">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Android is becoming the standard operating system for the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582_%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9">Internet of Things</a> - a term in Silicon Valley for the ever-expanding connections of smart devices, starting with the sensors in your shoes and ending with aircraft engine diagnostic systems.  And with the release of each such device on the Google market, Apple and Microsoft are increasingly breaking away in the struggle for the place of the main software player in the connected world. <br><br>  One of the reasons for the rapid take-off of Android was that Google distributed free software to device manufacturers and developers.  Google expects to earn on advertising and various services for smartphones and tablets on Android.  The open source also plays a role: anyone can tweak the source code for use in their gadget.  NASA engineers reduced the system's power consumption, which allowed their tiny satellites to work for several days on very weak batteries.  ‚ÄúIt will be interesting to see what ordinary people do in garages with really small and cheap companions,‚Äù says Oyadomari. <br><br>  Google acquired Android Inc.  in 2005. The search giant took a version of Linux - an open source operating system, already popular among geeks and in data centers - and refined it.  They have improved power consumption - the fewer tasks assigned to the central processor, the less electricity it uses.  Google also developed a more accessible interface and added finger control features.  Critics mocked the prospects for Android in the mobile market.  Nevertheless, his position as an open, free alternative to Apple, BlackBerry and Microsoft ultimately attracted a sufficient number of manufacturers - the largest of which is Samsung Electronics - so that in 2011 it could become the most popular mobile OS. <br><br>  Not only Google introduced its own, minimalist, Linux-based OS.  A few years ago, Intel developed a version of Linux for mobile devices called Moblin, at the same time Nokia created another version - Maemo.  Palm's webOS also used the Linux kernel.  As is usually the case with operating systems like Microsoft Windows in the 1990s, tech companies united around a single product.  And practical everywhere, except servers and personal computers, won Android. <br><br>  According to Jim Zemlin (Jim Zemlin), executive director of the non-profit fund of the Linux Foundation, Android has conquered the device market from the bottom up.  According to IDC research, in the first quarter of this year, the operating system was installed on 75% of smartphones produced - 162 million units.  While the iPhone and iPad are made in just a few variants, and only Apple itself, Android-carrying mobile devices of all sizes and shapes have flooded the market.  Component producing companies have to make sure that their products work well with these gadgets.  This leads to the fact that a huge and growing number of manufacturers of hardware and software are becoming experts in everything related to Android.  ‚ÄúAny screen, mobile processor and sensor should work well with Android,‚Äù says Zemlin. ‚ÄúThis is a network effect, so now the manufacturer of any non-standard product can take Android and do anything you want with it.‚Äù <br><br>  Zemlin cites the example of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAIC_Motor">SAIC Motor</a> , a Chinese automotive company.  A team of six engineers was enough to develop an Android infotainment system for its machines.  I met them at the exhibition, where they were located next to other car manufacturers with huge development teams, "says Zemlin," They said: we have only six engineers and Android. " <br><br>  Philip DesAutels, technology director of <a href="https://xively.com/">Xively</a> , a newly created cloud service that facilitates data acquisition from devices, has been studying the Internet of Things for many years.  He says that the Xively software option for Android is loaded five times more often than the iOS version.  His favorite product is an Android-based irrigation system for agricultural fields, in which a network of tiny, water-resistant computers controls water valves in the fields.  ‚ÄúWith Android, you get an energy efficient system, for which it‚Äôs easy to develop a touch interface, it‚Äôs easy to load data and upload it back,‚Äù DesAustells says, ‚Äúthe largest community is behind it.‚Äù <br><br>  Android's takeoff is very dangerous for Microsoft, which has been releasing a minimalist OS since 1996.  Known now as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Embedded">Windows Embedded</a> , it is used in Ford cars, NCR cash registers and other products.  But, apparently, Microsoft repeats the mistakes made with smartphones and tablets.  ‚ÄúWe have no requests for Microsoft support,‚Äù DesAustells says.  He adds that many companies want to make smart pedometers connected to the network of LED lights and other devices that can work with the iPhone and iPad.  Most likely, such devices will work on Android or something even simpler, DesAustells says, since Apple does not want iOS to work on products from other manufacturers.  Apple declined to comment on this statement.  Kevin Dallas, head of Windows Emedded, says Microsoft‚Äôs technology is more mature and sophisticated: ‚ÄúWindows Emedded is the most popular commercial platform at the moment.‚Äù <br><br>  Andy Rubin, who has been in charge of Google‚Äôs Android development for a long time, can write to his account most of his success.  With his own money, he opened a business incubator in Los Altos, California, in which his friends can work on a variety of projects.  One of his group Rubin said that Google received a lot of requests from automotive companies, but does not plan to work in this direction.  Very soon, four guys started a CloudCar startup, developing infotainment systems for cars that they will start selling later this year. <br><br>  Bottom line: after the capture of the mobile market, Android can become the standard operating system for the Internet of things. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-05-29/behind-the-internet-of-things-is-android-and-its-everywhere">Behind the Internet of Things Is Android ‚Äî and It's Everywhere</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/182674/">https://habr.com/ru/post/182674/</a></p>
