But I have a few friends who are.  Yesterday, after talking with one of them, I discovered that <strong>in addition to the</strong> Harry Porter <strong>series</strong> itself, there are <strong>other books on this universe</strong> written <strong>by Joan Kathleen Rowling herself</strong> .  Consider them in chronological order.  Basically, I will quote Wikipedia with some edits to reduce the text of the article and sometimes add my comments. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Fantastic Beasts and Their Habitats (Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them), 2001 </h1><br><img title="Fantastic Beasts and Their Habitats (Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them)" alt="      (Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them)" src="http://s003.radikal.ru/i202/1001/68/c28c75ca326f.jpg"><br>  The book was published under the pseudonym of Newt Scamander (Newt Scamander), a famous magical zoologist. <br><br><h3>  About the book </h3><br>  The book reviews the history of magical zoology, defines the concepts of "fantastic beast" and "fantastic creature", identifies the differences between them, describes the history of hiding magical animals from muggles, describes the classification of animals accepted by the Ministry of Magic, describes 75 different species found around the world .  The information contained in the book has been collected by Scamander over many years of observation and travel across 5 continents.  The book is a compulsory textbook for first-year students of Hogwarts.  The introduction of this book is written by Albus Dumbledore. <br>  A notable feature of the book is the marks left by Harry and Ron.  For example, one can learn from them that <strong>Hogwarts</strong> is in <strong>Scotland</strong> . <br><br>  <strong>Original:</strong> <a title="Original in English" href="http://www.amazon.com/Fantastic-Beasts-Where-Find-Them/dp/1551924560/ref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1263738683%26sr%3D1-1">Amazon.com</a> |  <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/download.php%3F2sjdykc1ymp">Download</a> <br>  <strong>Translation:</strong> <a title="Translating to Russian language" href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/4713405/">OZON.ru</a> |  <a href="http://gelan-rianon.narod.ru/Library/volshebn-tvari.pdf">To read</a>

When Severus Snape caught Harry with this book in Harry Potter‚Äôs novel and the Philosopher‚Äôs Stone, he came up with a rule prohibiting the removal of library books outside of Hogwarts. <br>  The book describes the history of Quidditch, as well as early broom based games.  The evolution of the flying broom, the appearance and development of Quidditch as a kind of magical sport, modification of rules throughout history, the history of the appearance of the golden snitch are considered.  It describes the basic rules of the game in Quidditch, the possible violations and punishments, the British and Irish teams, the basic models of racing bangers, as well as tactical methods of the game. <br><br>  <strong>Original:</strong> <a title="Original in English" href="http://www.amazon.com/Quidditch-Through-Ages-Harry-Potter/dp/0606221417/ref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1263738981%26sr%3D1-1">Amazon.com</a> |  <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/download.php%3Fvwnf3utlcmg">Download</a> <br>  <strong>Translation:</strong> <a title="Translating to Russian language" href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/4799533/">OZON.ru</a> |  <a href="http://gelan-rianon.narod.ru/Library/qviddichta.pdf">To read</a> <br><br><h3>  Collection (Box Set) </h3><br><img title="Throughout the Ages [BOX SET] Harry Potter Schoolbooks" alt="Harry Potter Schoolbooks: Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them / Quidditch Through the Ages [BOX SET]" src="http://s005.radikal.ru/i210/1001/b0/dfebfacd854a.jpg"><br><br>  <strong>Fantastic Beasts and Their Habitats</strong> (Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them) and <strong>Quidditch from Antiquity to the Present Day</strong> (Quidditch Through the Ages) were written by JK Rowling for the <a title="Comic Relief (comic help) - English charity foundation" href="http://www.comicrelief.com/">Comic Relief</a> Charitable Foundation and came out in the Bloomsbury publishing house together as a <strong>collection (Box Set)</strong> from two books.  According to Comic Relief, the proceeds from the sale of this collection amounted to 15.7 million pounds. <br><br>  <strong>Original:</strong> <a title="Original in English" href="http://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Schoolbooks-Fantastic-Quidditch/dp/043932162X/ref%3Dsr_1_3%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1263738683%26sr%3D1-3">Amazon.com (BOX SET)</a> <br>  <strong>Translation:</strong> translated books in the form of a collection of two books did not come out, there is a collection of three books <a title="Famous books of Hogwarts (set of 3 books)" href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/4857119/">OZON.ru</a> <br><br><h1>  Tales of Beedle the Bard, 2007 </h1><br><img title="The Tales of Beedle the Bard 'Moonstone Edition'" alt="The Tales of Beedle the Bard 'Moonstone Edition'" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3db/249/4ad/3db2494adf0a383c63f3b2f805bcd187.jpg">  The book is written by Joan Rowling <strong>as a farewell to a series of</strong> novels about Harry Potter.  At first, only <strong>six</strong> copies of the book were released, all of which were <strong>written by hand</strong> and illustrated by Rowling herself.  All copies were intertwined in brown morocco and decorated with handmade silver ornaments and semi-precious stones by Hamilton &amp; Inches jewelers from Edinburgh, each copy being decorated with its own type of semi-precious stones.  <strong>Each of the five parts of the</strong> silver ornament of the book symbolizes one of the 5 tales of the book.  All six copies of JK Rowling presented to close people who <strong>made the greatest contribution</strong> to the development of the series.  After some time, Joanne Rowling decided to create a <strong>seventh copy</strong> , which was decorated with a moonstone, for which he received the name <strong>"moonstone edition"</strong> .  This copy was auctioned at Sotheby‚Äôs on December 13, 2007. The funds from the sale were donated to The Children's Voice charitable organization that helps European children, and JK Rowling herself is one of the founders of this organization.  It was expected that the book will be sold for ¬£ 50,000 (about 100 thousand dollars).  In fact, it was sold for ¬£ 1,950,000 (about <strong>$ 4 million</strong> ).  Buyers are London art dealers, representing <strong>Amazon.com</strong> .  However, Amazon.com did not have the right to publish a book of copies of the book in any form, so all they could do was <strong>publish a retelling of</strong> fairy tales from the book. <br><br><img title="The Bard, Collector's Edition (Offered Exclusively by Amazon)" alt="The Tales of Beedle the Bard, Collector's Edition (Offered Exclusively by Amazon)" align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/611/a5d/eeb/611a5deeb16f0a33e7949f9742fe571f.jpg">  The fans of the series <strong>were outraged</strong> to learn that publications are <strong>not expected</strong> for the general public.  After some time, Joanne Rowling made concessions and on December 4, 2008 the book was published for the general public in <strong>two editions</strong> at once - standard and collection. <br><br><h3>  About the book </h3><br>  The collection includes five fairy tales invented by J. K. Rowling: <br><ul><li>  The Tale of the Three Brothers </li><li>  Fountain of Fortune (The Fountain of Fair Fortune) </li><li>  The Wizard and the Hopping Pot </li><li>  Bunny Shutikha and her stump-zuboskal (Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump) </li><li>  The Warlock's Hairy Heart </li></ul><br><br>  The tales of Bard Bidl are mentioned in the text of the book Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, and the text of the <strong>Tale of Three Brothers is</strong> even given in the seventh book of Harry Potter.  The content of this tale <strong>plays an important role</strong> in the development of the plot of the seventh book. <br><br><img title="The Tales of Beedle the Bard Standard Edition" alt="The Tales of Beedle the Bard, Standard Edition" src="http://s005.radikal.ru/i210/1001/0c/c3d4bb21414b.jpg"><br><br>  <strong>Original:</strong> <a title="Original in English" href="http://www.amazon.com/Beedle-Collectors-Offered-Exclusively-Amazon/dp/0956010903/ref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1263742346%26sr%3D1-1">Amazon.com: Collector's Edition</a> |  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tales-Beedle-Bard-Standard/dp/0545128285/ref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1263748575%26sr%3D1-1">Amazon.com: Standard Edition</a> |  <a title="Original in English" href="http://fliiby.com/file/472925/rthbp9scwq.html">To read</a> <br>  <strong>Translation:</strong> <a title="Translating to Russian language" href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/4100417/">OZON.ru</a> |  <a title="Translating to Russian language" href="">Download</a> <br><br><h1>  Harry Potter: the prehistory (Harry Potter prequel), 2008 </h1><br> <a href=""><img title="Harry Potter prequel (Harry Potter: Prehistory)" alt="Harry Potter prequel ( : )" align="left" src="http://s49.radikal.ru/i125/1001/43/bdb07693a591.jpg"></a>  This <strong>800-word-long</strong> work was written on a postcard by JK Rowling, specifically for sale at a charity auction with the support of <a href="http://www.waterstones.com/waterstonesweb/">Waterstone's bookstores</a> .  A postcard with text was sold <strong>on June 11, 2008</strong> for <strong>¬£ 25,000</strong> .  On the same day, the text of the story was published on the Internet. <br><br><h3>  Plot </h3><br>  <strong>Sirius Black</strong> and <strong>James Potter</strong> , running away on a motorcycle from a police car chasing them, are turned into a narrow alley between the houses, at the end of which there is a dead end.  The car also drives into this lane and, as such, adolescents are squeezed between the wall and the police car.  Sergeant Fisher and policeman Anderson get out of the car and charge looters with speeding, riding a motorcycle without a helmet and resisting arrest.  Suddenly, three figures on the broom appear in the alley, Sirius and James utter some kind of spell that raises the car on its hind legs, and leaves the trinity unconscious.  In the next moment, Sirius and James fly off on a motorcycle, leaving the bewildered police. <br><br>  <strong>Original:</strong> <a title="Original in English" href="http://www.gryffindorgazette.com/2008/06/11/the-harry-potter-prequel-read-it-here/">Read</a> <br>  <strong>Translation:</strong> <a title="Translating to Russian language" href="http://www.diary.ru/~belomoeff/p44412518.htm">Read</a> <br><br><h1>  Harry Potter Encyclopedia </h1><br>  On December 18, 2007, in an interview with <strong>PotterCast,</strong> JK Rowling <a href="http://pottercast.the-leaky-cauldron.org/episode/show/166">stated</a> that she would write this book, but would not rush into writing and asked not to rush it.  In April 2008, she announced that <strong>she</strong> had <strong>begun work</strong> on a book.  There is some evidence that some work on the book is still underway.  So, friend and neighbor Joan, writer Ian Rankin (Ian Rankin) mentioned on September 4, 2009 in an interview with the BBC that she is working on the genealogical trees of all the characters.  However, on September 13, 2009, Neil Blair, attorney Joan Rowling, <a href="http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/showbiz/2009/09/13/exclusive-friend-spills-beans-on-jk-rowling-s-latest-harry-potter-book-78057-21669831/">said</a> in an interview with The Sunday Mail that "Encyclopedia simply <strong>remains something</strong> that Miss Rowling is going to <strong>end</strong> sometime in the future."  Thus, the question of when this will be released and the book (and whether it will be released at all) <strong>remains open</strong> . <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/81012/">https://habr.com/ru/post/81012/</a></p>
