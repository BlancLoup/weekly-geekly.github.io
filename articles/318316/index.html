  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Friday format: Successful vacation for an IT specialist or some other favorite work</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Workaholics is becoming more and more, and entrepreneurs, programmers, designers and marketers often explain their processing to the fact that they just like their work. <br><br>  According to the results of a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/syndromes-drive-coders-crazy-2014-3">study</a> conducted at Stanford University, programmers who spend at the office 20 hours a week more than the norm (that is, 60 hours instead of the standard 40), perform their work less efficiently.  Such workers often need rest so that their productivity does not suffer. <br><br>  We at <a href="https://1cloud.ru/blog">1cloud</a> deal with a variety of IT related topics.  Today we decided to talk a little about the culture of work and leisure, we considered examples of holiday incentives of some IT companies and the general situation with workaholism.

But at the junction of travel'a and technology is the most famous example of a vacation "buns" - <a href="http://listverse.com/2016/05/29/10-of-the-coolest-employee-perks-offered-by-tech-companies/">2 thousand dollars</a> , which Airbnb allocates to its employees to pay for housing anywhere in the world through its own service. <br><br>  We decided to go the same way to Rocketmiles (an online platform that gives you the opportunity to earn miles for staying at a hotel).  For each employee who goes on vacation, the company allocates a <a href="http://www.builtinchicago.org/2016/10/19/chicago-tech-companies-cool-perks">thousand dollars</a> that can be spent on the employer's site.  And in Epic Systems, employees <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/234183">receive</a> miles and points that can be spent on flights and hotel fees. <br><br>  There are other examples of generosity companies.  Employees of the American IT company Loadspring after two years of work may receive additional leave and up to <a href="http://listverse.com/2016/05/29/10-of-the-coolest-employee-perks-offered-by-tech-companies/">6 thousand dollars</a> to pay for travel outside the US. <br><br>  In addition, companies often increase the amount of vacation time depending on their work experience: for example, on Google, vacation increases from 15 days in employment <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Benefits/Google-Vacation-and-Paid-Time-Off-US-BNFT29_E9079_N1.htm">to 25 days after five years of work</a> .  At Intel, paid vacation of <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/highest-rated-companies-vacation-paid-time-off-2016-10/">4 weeks (in a row)</a> can be taken after 4 years of work, and once in 7 years, you can get as many as 8 weeks. <br><br><h2>  Unlimited vacation </h2><br>  More and more companies choose this system: for example, Twitter, Pinterest, Zynga, Automattic.  And the very first it was introduced to Netflix in 2004.  More precisely, they only openly abandoned the system for calculating vacations and strict control. <br><br>  This approach gives employees the opportunity to more often take paid time off for a few days, whereas previously they had to deduct them from the total number of vacation days.  Of course, in the event of an emergency, employers will meet you halfway, but it is much more comfortable to know that once a couple of months you can plan an additional day off. <br><br>  Initially, the company had concerns about potential abuses and possible loss of control over the work environment, but as it is written in Netflix‚Äôs corporate policy: ‚Äúwe also lack a dress code, but no one comes to work naked.‚Äù <br><br>  Employees understand that they are expected to perform work duties.  This is the main problem of such a bonus - the culture of workaholism simply does not allow to decide on a full vacation.  In addition, companies often write in the rules that the length of the vacation must be acceptable.  But who determines this acceptability?  Especially if there is no seasonal lull in the company and there are deadlines and projects all year round, then there may not even be time to think about vacation. <br><br>  In addition, with the usual system, all unrepaid holidays are summed up in both Russian and Western companies.  When the sum of days approached the burned, personnel officers could ask the employee to rest for at least a couple of days.  And if you worked hard all the years of work and did not take time off, then when you quit, you were paid compensation.  In the system of free vacations, there is nothing to summarize, and, accordingly, to compensate. <br><br><h2>  There is no time to rest </h2><br>  The tough competition, and in IT it is even higher due to the large number of qualified specialists who can work from anywhere in the world, does not allow to relax.  But not only in large companies it is customary to recycle - working in a small startup, you are very likely to be overloaded with additional functions and job responsibilities. <br><br>  How can you leave when there is no one to shift your work to anyone?  So it turns out that even if you manage to get on vacation, you will most likely have to work remotely. <br><br>  Of course, it all depends on the company.  Somewhere taken to take 2-3 days during the year, somewhere, on the contrary, frequent time off is considered inappropriate.  But the main thing is that very few employees decide to take time off from their boss for a long vacation. <br><br>  In China, as you know, things with workaholism are even worse.  There, IT professionals literally have to live at work for a week.  As start-up employees say, the competition in the market is huge, and processing is a must. <br><br>  And why spend 4 hours a day on the road, when you can sleep in the workplace?  In addition, daytime sleep is also not forbidden and you can take a nap for 30 minutes to reboot the brain. <br><br>  Russian companies have not yet reached such extremes, although small processing is also taken for granted.  Although everything is <a href="http://ibusiness.ru/blog/money/41962">relative</a> : due to the fact that China does not have a standardized working day, the average Hong Kong resident works 2606 hours a year, which is almost a thousand hours more than the average Muscovite (1674 hours). <br><br>  An important difference in the vacation system is that in the United States, paid vacation is not mandatory at the legislative level, and 25% of Americans simply do not have it.  From this point of view, the situation in the IT market does not look so bad.  Russia is in the first place in the total number of public holidays (12 days) and vacation days (28). <br><br>  If we look at the statistics on holidays, then in 2016, 53% of Americans did not go on leave longer than 7 days in the last 12 months, and 37% did not go anywhere for two years in a row.  In terms of days, Americans have not spent 658 million paid vacation days.  In Russia this year, the duration of vacations in the summer period was reduced by 24%, and 48% of those surveyed intended to completely abandon their vacations this year. <br><br>  <i><b>PS</b> Well, we continue to work.</i>  <i>Our today's material is <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/318286/">Personal Experience: How we automated work with DNS records in the hosting panel</a> .</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/318316/">https://habr.com/ru/post/318316/</a></p>
