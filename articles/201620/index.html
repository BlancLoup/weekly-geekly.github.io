  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Zoom TV: how to change the way you control your TV forever</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/zoomtv/blog/201338/">In the last post,</a> I <s>insidiously mislead honest citizens and bore anti-scientific nonsense</s> outlined an important, in my opinion, problem: the traditional method of controlling a TV gives mothballs and does not correspond at all to the current socio-technological moment.  To force the user to manually search for the transmission he needs by means of a television remote in our time is the same as preferring manual human labor to robots. <br><br>  Again, I firmly believe that the modern urban man has every right to furnish the space around him in full accordance with the precepts of consumerist Feng Shui: that is,  receive services to the maximum, and put efforts to a minimum (ideally - do not put any effort at all).  The elimination of mechanical and monotonous actions from our lives is one of the goals of technical progress.  And the long-term resistance of TV (more than 50 years) here is something out of the ordinary. <br><br>  Well-known expert and expert in the field of media interfaces, Joseph Goebbels once said, ‚ÄúA critic must be ready and able at any time and on demand to take the place of those he criticizes and to carry out his work productively and competently;  otherwise, criticism becomes a brazen self-sufficient force and becomes a brake on cultural progress. ‚Äù  Well, I decided to follow this advice and present a method for solving the well-known problem.

      Our team has developed ZOOM TV - an application for modern TVs, analyzing the categories of programs of interest to the viewer.  Having collected the necessary data on user preferences, it automatically switches between the highest-rated programs from those categories that interest him.  Thus, the application protects a person from uninteresting programs and minimizes the number of actions necessary for management. <br><br>  The question arises - but how does it work?  I'll explain now. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Imagine that you like comics.  The application will closely monitor which programs you focus on, how long you watch them, etc.  And then it will start looking for the best examples of the genre.  Therefore, it will offer you the Nolan trilogy about Batman, and not the infamous "Batman and Robin" by Joel Schumacher;  "Green Hornet", but not, forgive, Lord, "Green Lantern";  "X-Men: First Class", but not "X-Men: Wolverine";  ‚ÄúJudge Dredd‚Äù of 2012, but not ‚ÄúJudge Dredd‚Äù sample of 1996.  However, the genre is too simple. <br><br>  Here the program noticed your attention to Sylvester Stallone.  Here, it would seem, her soulless mechanism should, without looking at quality, interfere in one heap and toss at the same time both Cobra and Spy Kids 3, Expendables and Remove Carter, Rocky and Detoxification. "... (did not watch" Detoxification "? How I envy you!).  But no matter how wrong - the application, in the first place, will offer you the most rated films with this actor. <br><br>  The application quickly learns and adapts to the user's preferences, somewhat expanding the scope of the proposal.  For example, if you often watch political news from CNN and the BBC, after some time, in addition to the programs of the relevant direction, you will begin to offer the series ‚ÄúHouse of Cards‚Äù with Kevin Spacey and ‚ÄúState of play‚Äù. <br><br>  But it costs genre preferences to change a little - and this will immediately affect the list of recommendations, because the application is constantly learning. <br><br>  Work on the application is still underway, but the first results seriously reassure us: we reached the final of the BIT competition and, most importantly, in less than two weeks the application was installed by almost 15 thousand users.  And this, I note, without any measures for promotion, on a small platform provided to us by Samsung "in test mode".  So we are on the right track.  In the following posts I will tell you more about the work of the application.  And here I am ready to answer questions in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/201620/">https://habr.com/ru/post/201620/</a></p>
