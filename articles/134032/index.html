  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About hosting in RuNet from the inside</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A year ago, I <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hosting/107675/">wrote</a> about my experience in running a free hosting. <br>  Now I want to talk about paid hosting.  I have much more experience in this. <br><br>  <b>Legality</b> <br>  Approximately, 90% of hosting providers in runet work without a license for telematics. <br>  It is understandable.  This is the most difficult link in the chain of deployment of hosting. <br>  Probably, this is even a protest of Russian hosters.  Indeed, in the USA, Germany, in [in] Ukraine and in general in most countries there is no such hemorrhoids with obtaining a license and handing over the communications center. <br>  Most often, the stages of creating a hosting look like this: <br>  1. Leases a server.  If abroad, a little cheaper and safer in terms of legality. <br>  2. One of the panels is installed on the server: ISPmanager, DirectAdmin and [less often the first two] CPanel. <br>  3. Billing is also installed: BPanel, CEpanel, RootPanel or ISP BILLmanager. <br>  4. And create a site.  More often on a pattern [of which there are thousands in the network].  And, voila - hosting is ready to accept customers. <br>  Many novice hosters spare money even for an SSL certificate. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Competition</b> <br>  Probably, the hosting market is one of the most competitive markets in Russia. <br>  The fact is that in RuNet there are more than 1000 hosting sites, where everyone is charged with 1-2 people. <br>  This leads to rabid dumping and, accordingly, overselling [roughly speaking, on a server that can withstand 100 average clients, 200 places are sold]. <br>  Dumping, indeed, is becoming inconceivable.  You are ready to give hosting for free for almost a month.  They give you a full-fledged hosting for $ 0.5 per month - in general, they are doing everything to get a client. <br><br>  <b>Customer minds</b> <br>  I was always surprised that the majority saves on hosting. <br>  The average tariff plan now costs 90 rubles.  This, attention, 3 rubles a day! <br>  So, in fact, it is on such tariff plans that most commercial sites are hosted. <br>  When the hosting falls and rolls one day, customer losses can amount to thousands of rubles. <br>  And what a hoster?  The hoster receives from you for this day 3 rubles and you really hope for 100% uptime? <br>  To keep you for 3 rubles a day, the hoster has to go on numerous tricks. <br>  As I wrote above, your site for that kind of money does not end up in a luxurious house or even in a Khrushchevka. <br>  For the money he lives in a hostel and no one gives any guarantees about your neighbors.

      <b>Accommodation</b> <br>  I managed to live with the servers in the following data centers: <br>  eServer.ru [M-101], hosting.ua, burst.NET, hetzner.de, nac.net, web-dc. <br>  It should be noted that I have never had my own servers. <br>  I rented them. <br>  One can argue about this for a long time, but I remain convinced that at current prices for placement and the frequency of equipment failures, it is more profitable for small companies to rent a server. <br><br>  <b>Technical support</b> <br>  Among many there is an opinion that the support of hosting users is tedious and difficult. <br>  In fact, support is one of the least disturbing things. <br>  A year and a half ago, at the peak of my own, so to speak, hosting career, I had about 1,000 clients. <br>  They were distributed on 10 servers [in three different countries]. <br>  So, the support itself did not even take a full hour a day. <br>  It is much more problematic to follow unfortunate webmasters with badly unoptimized scripts. <br>  Woe webmasters I would divide into two categories: <br>  - those that break the rules <br>  - those that overload the server. <br>  The first ones are usually detected by knocking, but sometimes it takes a lot of time to calculate the second. <br><br>  <b>Backups</b> <br>  It is obvious that even if the contract does not stipulate the obligation of the host to monitor the safety of files, it is in his interest to have a fresh copy of all files in another data center. <br>  I formatted the main disk twice by mistake! <br>  The third time we found a fire in the hosting center hosting.ua <br>  Then many were burned by the fact that they kept backups in the same DC. <br>  We, fortunately, kept backups in the United States.  Recovery took about three days. <br><br>  <b>Test period</b> <br>  When launching one hosting project, I decided to try to thoroughly promote the fact that the first week of hosting at any rate is free.  And what do you think? <br>  For several months, I received about 300 unique orders of the test period.  Not bad, yes. <br>  But!  Not more than 15 people have passed from the test period to the paid one! <br>  I do not know why so far large hostings practice free test periods. <br>  First, it is fertile ground for any evil spirits like phishers and spammers. <br>  Secondly, the real client takes the hosting and starts using it, and does not bother with the reduced test accounts.  So, this trick was unsuccessful. <br><br>  <b>Nervado</b> <br>  Obviously, each server downtime causes a lot of stress. <br>  It is during technical problems that you have questions and send rays of diarrhea with a force of 100,500 cd. <br>  When hundreds of sites do not work, you can not go to bed. <br>  You spend days and nights restoring work. <br>  This is probably the main disadvantage of this business - responsibility disproportionate to revenues. <br><br>  <b>Profitability</b> <br>  If you develop hosting over the years and according to plan, you can get a good profitability. <br>  The maximum that worked for me was 200%.  But I almost invested everything there, in expansion and advertising. <br>  And, to tell the truth, I managed to promote hosting to the middle one quickly enough. <br>  Most hosters in runet do not even recruit 100 clients.  <a href="http://1stat.ru/providers">Proof</a> . <br>  By the way, in the hosting, too, 20% of customers pay more than everyone else :) <br>  And no more than a third of customers use most of the allocated resources. <br><br>  Thanks for attention.  This is purely my experience, so I can be wrong.  I hope you were interested. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134032/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134032/</a></p>
