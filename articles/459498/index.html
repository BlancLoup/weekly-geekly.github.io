      And here it turns out that the guns have never been sent.  In advance, the connection of alien or self-hosted platforms was not made by pushing them.  And this is not 15 minutes and not an hour, well, if you connect it in a week.  Started magic and magic.  Everything is incomprehensible, strange and unpredictable. <br><br>  The development has become completely unpredictable for one reason only: they did not take into account that, in addition to the business tasks layer, there is also an infrastructure layer. <br><br>  If the business tasks layer is a fountain, spewing a lot of small tasks, hypothesis testing and visual whistles, then the infrastructure is its pipes.  Here we need a planning horizon of at least six months ahead. <br><br><h2>  Pipes for fountains </h2><br>  Due to the complexity and the requirements to be very attentive to the little things, specially trained people are engaged in the development of "pipes": Devops, who have grown out of the most experienced administrators and developers.  Their work is planned and strictly consistent.  They are like bridge builders - any mistake leads to the fact that an easy business task for 15 minutes suddenly turns into infrastructure rescheduling for many days and money. <br><br>  Slurm is currently the only course in Russia (known to me) that teaches building infrastructure in a standardized way, allowing at least to level planning errors.  I was on the Kubernetes courses, and in September I'm going to a new DevOps course. <br><br>  Slurm was invented by Southbridge, an administrative outsourcer who built dozens of fountains of various shapes.  Southbridge is a certified KTP and KCSP (CNCF, Linux Foundation Member). <br><br><h2>  What exactly are taught in the Kubernetes courses? </h2><br><h4>  How to organize everything that the developers have done and that it does not fall? </h4><br><ul><li>  Work with Kubespray </li><li>  Installation of optional components </li><li>  Testing and troubleshooting the cluster </li></ul><br><h4>  How to make the authorization of users (developers) in the cluster to work with the cluster itself? </h4><br><ul><li>  LDAP (Nginx + Python) </li><li>  OIDC (Dex + Gangway) </li></ul><br><h4>  How to protect against hackers at the network level? </h4><br><ul><li>  Introduction to CNI </li><li>  Network security policy </li></ul><br><h4>  And generally safety! </h4><br><ul><li>  PodSecurityPolicy </li><li>  PodDisruptionBudget </li></ul><br><h4>  We do not hide anything, - we are telling in detail what is under the hood </h4><br><ul><li>  Controller structure </li><li>  Operators and CRD </li></ul><br><h4>  Stateful applications in a cluster </h4><br><ul><li>  Starting a database cluster using PostgreSQL </li><li>  Running RabbitMQ Cluster </li></ul><br><h4>  How not to store multiple passwords and configs in the clear </h4><br><ul><li>  Secrets Management in Kubernetes </li><li>  Vault </li></ul><br><h4>  Fingertip horizontal scaling </h4><br><ul><li>  Theory </li><li>  Practice </li></ul><br><h4>  Backups </h4><br><ul><li>  Backup and restore a cluster using Heptio Velero (formerly Ark) and etcd </li></ul><br><h4>  Easy roll-out in test, stage and production </h4><br><ul><li>  Lint </li><li>  Templating and Deployment Tools </li><li>  Deploy strategies </li></ul><br>  There is also a course on steroids, there everything is generally hardcore.  However, after the basic course you can already build your fountain. <br><br>  After Slurm, the participants were left with artifacts - a video of all the days, detailed instructions for each item, along with exact recipes, whose commands can be copied stupidly to collect either a backup solution or a solution for test environments or something else. <br><br>  That is, everything is so simple.  Yes.  He came for a few days, plunged into the topic, received accurate recipes and returned to the workplace to build the project's infrastructure - simply, correctly and, most importantly, predictably in time.  Magic and witchcraft are over, it remains just to work. <br><br><h2>  What is the result? </h2><br>  At the end of the race for a few days comes the feeling that the real serious projects are being built by almost the devops themselves.  And it is surprising that all the material covered is understandable, I reproduce it already on my own servers every day. <br><br>  Fortunately, the entire audience moved to chat cart, where even after many weeks there is life. <br><br><h2>  What's next? </h2><br>  The organizers in the fall are preparing Slurm Devops, I am already preparing.  I‚Äôll write about this soon in my <a href="https://t.me/ctorecords">tech-idir channel in the @ctorecords cart</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/459498/">https://habr.com/ru/post/459498/</a></p>
