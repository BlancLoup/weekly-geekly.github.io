  <section class="page js-page"><h1>90% of office employees use the Network for personal purposes.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As part of the June online omnibus, <a href="http://www.rmh.ru/">ROMIR Monitoring</a> research holding asked its respondents a number of questions about their use of work computers and the Internet for non-working (personal) purposes. <br><br>  The survey involved 1,412 active Internet users (who log on to the Network at least once a month) aged 18 years and older.  The sample represents the Russian Internet audience, which, according to the results of the Internet Monitoring survey in the first quarter of this year, amounted to 22% of the country's adult population (the statistical error does not exceed ¬± 2.5%). <br><br>  As part of the study, it was found that in 76% of respondents the main work activity is connected with a computer.  90% of them admitted to using the service computer and the Internet for personal purposes.  At the same time, less than half of the users with work computers (39%) have access to the Internet unlimited.  The rest told about a variety of limitations and obstacles imposed by employers and system administrators.

      For example, 19% said about the restriction of Internet traffic, in the companies another 18% of survey participants imposed restrictions on access to certain sites (types of sites).  In 18% of cases, respondents said that the company‚Äôs leadership opposes the use of the Internet for personal purposes, 14% complained about the hidden administration of work computers.  And finally, 6% of respondents said that their work computers are either not connected to the Internet at all, or the Internet is extremely ‚Äúslow‚Äù. <br><br>  So what do internet users do on work computers?  According to the survey, the overwhelming majority of respondents (86%) read the news on the Internet, another 80% are searching the web for information that is not related to work.  Six out of ten respondents (60%) actively communicate with friends through ICQ and other programs, and another 60% of respondents read books and materials not related to work, in electronic libraries or on information portals.  57% of survey participants said that they did not just read various non-work related materials on the Web, but also downloaded them.  Every second respondent (55%) follows the news by reading online versions of newspapers and magazines.  At the same time, most of those who arrange such respite for themselves in such various ways and pauses of work ensure that they abuse the Internet at most 30 minutes a day. <br><br>  According to leading ROMIR Monitoring consultant for qualitative research, Doctor of Psychology Olga Melnikova, it is possible that in fact respondents devote a little more time to their personal hobbies during working hours.  This is due to the elementary desire to diminish their ‚Äúguilt‚Äù - after all, respondents are well aware that at work they should be engaged exclusively in work, but they cannot but take advantage of the situation - having a computer connected to the network to satisfy information hunger or thirst for communication.  And, secondly, not all users can really control the time they devote to personal affairs during the working day.  It may seem to them that no more than <nobr>20-30</nobr> minutes have passed, as they plunged into reading or games, and in fact much more time has passed. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4107/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4107/</a></p>
