Today in the market there are dozens of brands that offer several thousand models.  Prices for these auto gadgets start at 650 rubles and reach a space of 30 thousand. <br><br>  And they really work.  Naturally, this is not a panacea for all the surprises on the road, but unlike the CDs popular at the time, under the windshield, they actually perform their functions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Whistler brand is considered one of the best in terms of price-quality ratio among radar detectors.  That is why we could not deprive ourselves of the pleasure to try out the youngest model in the line - the budget 118ST Ru.  The average price for this gadget is 1,900 rubles, ‚ÄúRu‚Äù in the title means adapting the device to the radars common in Russia (and, of course, instructions translated into ‚Äúgreat and powerful‚Äù, plus Russian inscriptions on the box), and ‚ÄúST‚Äù - the ability to detect the radiation of radar type "Arrow". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/87e/9a6/c4d/87e9a6c4de574d3ebb786755d5160c01.png">

A couple of years ago, these radars with impunity devastated the wallets of lovers of supersonic speeds - at that time, the only means to deal with the Strelka were databases with their GPS coordinates.  But if this trick worked with stationary radars, then the Strelka mobile versions were nothing. <br><br>  Today, radar detectors that see the Strelka are already quite a few, and the 118ST is one of them.  We spent several hours on Moscow roads, we were irradiated by Amata, Binara, Golden Eagles, Arenas, Sparks, Radis, Kris, the notorious ‚ÄúArrows‚Äù and even ‚ÄúRobots‚Äù - Whistler recognizes them all from a distance of one and a half kilometers to 600-700 meters . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a2d/b65/35b/a2db6535bb914989bb01df122f0b8bcd.png"><br><br>  We tested the 118ST abilities in several ways at once - using the online resource Radarinfo.ru, the mobile applications AntiRadar and Smart Drive, as well as tags in Yandex.Maps.  Carping failed - Whistler worked like a clock (well - almost like a clock). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb1/aac/f3c/bb1aacf3ca224a1db38c598b8b350aa1.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b52/9af/84c/b529af84cdfd45d3950d936016a44735.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/72a/0da/5b6/72a0da5b67284a1da6145a81ae17b9cd.png"><br><br>  All radars detected by the gadget were recorded in databases.  But as practice shows, using them to quickly track recently installed or mobile radars is almost impossible.  And almost all motorists (and we are not an exception) are faced with such a trick.  Draw your own conclusions: a smartphone or a navigator, even with the most recent links to radars, in this case will not help you for sure. <br><br>  One of the important parameters of a modern radar detector is sensitivity (or noise immunity), otherwise, the ability of a gadget to distinguish important signals from useless - simple models will react, literally, to everything - from sensors on the doors of stores to radar detectors and parking sensors in other cars . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b14/314/ab6/b14314ab60a943d9aaf4f10d8c0b9218.png"><br><br>  In this regard, Whistler showed average results.  That, however, was not a surprise for us: first, this is a budget model, and second, all radar detectors, even in special ‚Äúcity‚Äù modes, record external radiations (for 118 ST Ru, by the way, there are three of them).  With no exceptions.  That is why experienced motorists often include radar detectors just outside the city.  Or develop resistance to constant buzzing gadget. <br><br>  Whistler 118ST Ru has an interesting opportunity - the manufacturer promises a 360-degree radiation detection.  And it really works.  But our opinion is rather an informative function than a warning one - it is unlikely that something will give you the knowledge that you were ‚Äúshot down‚Äù from somewhere behind. <br><br>  Yes, a few words about the appearance of the gadget - nothing supernatural, everything is simple and quite elegant.  There is an on / off and volume adjustment wheel, three hardware buttons ‚Äî a menu plus a quiet mode (MENU / QUIET), a display brightness (DARK), and a selection of city modes (CITY).  Instead of the LCD indicator here - a set of LEDs.  In our opinion, this is not a minus, but rather a plus - at a speed of under two hundred, there is no time to read small inscriptions on an alphanumeric display. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f74/a8c/400/f74a8c400a9c44d6b0c18e4dc765d3a5.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0cd/17c/57c/0cd17c57c7d84db98bedca13c891431a.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e4/9e2/d7e/0e49e2d7e8df4f30ba8c2834972241f6.png"><br><br>  Despite the minimum of buttons, there is something to customize - lovers of customization and personification will find something to do for an evening or two. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a54/e67/37d/a54e6737dc484d3f9517a94666c29d89.png"><br><br>  The sound of this radar detector may seem harsh to someone, but it perfectly stands out against the background of city noises and even vigorous music from a car radio. <br><br>  There is a note on the box with ‚ÄúWhistler‚Äù - ‚ÄúIt detects the laser radars of the USA and the Russian Federation‚Äù.  We have dealt with Russia, about the States - we will take it by word.  However, knowing the set of working ranges of the gadget, you can take it with you on a trip to the ‚ÄúEurope‚Äù - after all, the velvet season is near.  But!  Be alert!  In many European countries, radar detectors are prohibited, their use or even presence in the car is punished with a considerable fine, and the device itself can be withdrawn.  These gadgets are allowed in the UK, Iceland, Romania, as well as Belarus, Kazakhstan, Moldova and Ukraine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3bc/a9f/e88/3bca9fe8846e41249e8509347312e02e.png"><br><br>  In general, the situation with radar detectors is similar to the arms race: as soon as something new appears in the arsenal of valiant traffic policemen, somewhere underground, they begin to invent an electronic antidote in Chinese secret laboratories.  And vice versa.  It is gratifying that the developers of radar detectors under the Whistler brand are watching fashion trends in the police radar market.  and the 118ST Ru model recognizes a lot of things that hit us with invisible rays on the roads of Russia. <br><br>  Subscribe to <a href="http://bit.ly/GTF_YouTube">the Geek to the Future YouTube channel</a> , join our groups in social networks and do not forget - nobody canceled the rules of the road. <br><br>  PS By the way, if you have a desire to try out Whistler radar detectors in action, take part in a joint <a href="http://bit.ly/GTTF_Wistler">competition Geek to the Future and the Avtoden company</a> : until September 20, we will play three gadgets - 268Ru, 138Ru and 118ST Ru.  Good luck! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/235989/">https://habr.com/ru/post/235989/</a></p>
