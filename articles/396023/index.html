      Before going to the cinema there is another opportunity to enjoy the world of Star Trek.  A 35-year-old film director from Bavaria by the name of J√ºrgen Kaiser spent seven years living to create his version of the film.  Its version is called Star Trek Enterprise II: The Beginning of the End.  The idea to create your own movie in the Star Trek universe came to the director after the end of the third season of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2597%25D0%25B2%25D1%2591%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D1%258C:_%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D0%25B7">Star Trek: Enterprise</a> .  In this series, the spectator was shown the very beginning of human exploration of the cosmic expanses of the Universe - in 2151, 100 years before the events of the main storyline.  In his film, the director shows a side storyline. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The film does not play human actors.  Instead, they use dolls (their size is about 16 centimeters).  What does not spoil the overall impression - the level of detail of the world in this film is very high.  Graphic effects are used, the main characters are voiced by professional actors.  So after two minutes of watching, the absence of human actors no longer seems like something unpleasant. <br><br>  There is one more thing - the film was shot in Germany, voiced by dolls by German actors, in German.  If you know German, this is not a problem.  There are also subtitles, English and German.  Unfortunately, there is no Russian language. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/bJ3FNopHpTI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgkmbyltOf5pZBsDH8H5J7kGkL2aQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The director spent his money on shooting.  It was decided not to hold the crowdfunding company, contributions were also not accepted: the director was afraid that his video would be removed from YouTube if he would accept contributions from other people. <br><br>  For shooting using a SLR camera.  One frame is 30 photos. <br><br>  The director did not work on his film alone.  Along with him in the filming took part voice actors, composer, a specialist in 3D graphics.  After the filming process was completed, the director spent another year to put all the elements together. <br><br>  The plot is fascinating.  There are many surprises here, guests from other worlds, references to other films. <br><br>  The author of the film emphasizes that his work is serious, it is not a parody.  The action in Star Trek Enterprise II: The Beginning of the End begins from the point at which the fourth season of the original Star Trek: Enterprise show ended. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396023/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396023/</a></p>
