  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Microsoft, UN and EmerCoin: using blockchain technology in real projects</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A few days ago, there was <a href="http://www.hr.undp.org/content/croatia/en/home/blog/2016/9/19/UNDP-Alternative-Financing-Lab-the-next-big-thing-is-a-lot-of-small-and-smart-things-.html">news</a> that the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), which was created to assist development countries, would use blockchain technology based on the <a href="http://emercoin.com/">EmerCoin</a> platform.  The same platform has become one of the first partner providers of the blockchain service in the Azure Marketplace.  We decided that this is a great opportunity to tell you more about the news itself and to interview the lead developer EmerCoin, in which you will learn the most frequent questions about working with Microsoft and participating in the BaaS program. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a6a/86d/25f/a6a86d25f38f452aa515d5c83a5f971a.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  The UN announced the use of the blockchain in real projects </h3><br>  One of the key problems that currently exists in UNDP is that the organization spontaneously receives a significant portion of funding from various sources, which leads to difficulties in controlling the funds received.  To solve it, the <a href="http://europeandcis.undp.org/blog/2015/12/07/lets-play-some-leapfrog-with-the-undpcrowd/">Alternative Finance Lab</a> was established in Istanbul in 2015. <br><br>  On September 19, in the official UN blog, <a href="http://europeandcis.undp.org/blog/2015/12/07/lets-play-some-leapfrog-with-the-undpcrowd/">news</a> emerged that <a href="http://emercoin.com/">EmerCoin</a> , a Russian cryptocurrency project representing the blockchain technology platform for network security, will be one of the tools that will soon be introduced into the work of the UNDP organization.  This is an extremely significant event that can significantly stimulate the development of the blockchain.

    <h3>  How is EmerCoin related to Microsoft? </h3><br>  In 2015, Microsoft Azure launched the Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) service, an experimental blockchain platform that allows companies to create private blockchains and form smart contracts that are automatically executed when certain actions are performed or conditions are reached. <br><br>  On June 19, 2016, there was <a href="http://bits.media/news/v-microsoft-azure-market-zapushchena-platforma-emercoin-blockchain-engine/">news</a> that EmerCoin released the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/partners/emercoin/emercoin/">Emercon Blokchain Engine</a> app, the first blockchain-based application in the Azure Marketplace, designed for the end user.  With it, any user can deploy an Emercoin Blockchain Engine fully ready for use with EMCSSH service and a web wallet using a Microsoft Azure subscription, without any additional settings and settings. <br><br>  This application is a construction element, that is, it can be used in two ways: as a blockchain-based BaaS subsystem for more complex systems and as an independent online wallet with web access. <br><br><h3>  Interview with the leading developer EmerCoin </h3><br>  The expert in the field of cryptography and computer security and the leading developer of cryptocurrency EmerCoin, Oleg Hovayko, will tell us about the issues that are often received at EmerCoin. <br><br>  <b>Why did Microsoft suddenly choose EmerCoin for its new BaaS service?</b>  <b>How does a little-known cryptocurrency with a small capitalization suddenly receive the support of an IT industry giant?</b> <br><br>  The answer is that, based on the very name of BaaS (Blockchain as a Service), Microsoft is interested in services, and not in capitalization or fame.  Therefore, for the BaaS platform, blockchains (not currencies) were the first to be selected, providing unique services, in addition to the function of sending credit units.  Please note that even a cryptocurrency with overwhelming capitalization and maximum fame, Bitcoin was not included in the BaaS program. <br><br>  <b>How did this happen technically?</b> <br><br>  After the information about the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/blockchain/">BaaS</a> program was published, we contacted Marley Gray, the program manager, and presented our technologies.  You can read <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-baas-update-2/">here the</a> beginning of our correspondence.  After that, Microsoft evaluated our technologies and included EmerCoin in the program.  Then everything was quite prosaic - as a result of collaboration, we created the BaaS-service Blockchain Engine, which provides a turnkey solution, and published it in our Azure Marketplace. <br><br>  In general, conspiracy theories will be disappointed - the choice was made openly and on the basis of an objective analysis of the technologies presented. <br><br>  <b>What is the uniqueness of your technology?</b> <br><br>  First, EmerCoin has not only a number of unique technological solutions such as kernels (STUN, asymmetric split, distributed checkpoints, etc), but also utilitarian technologies.  Our utilitarian technologies and services are based on our NVS (Name-Value Storage) product, a universal distributed trusted storage service based on EmerCoin blockchain, and can be used by BaaS users. <br><br>  There are a lot of similar services, and we'll talk about them in other posts.  The EmerCoin approach is unique in that it includes ‚Äúmany services in one blockchain,‚Äù which allows you to develop other services together with Microsoft.  It is also important that our BaaS platform successfully closes the field of industrial reliable solutions, as well as services in the field of network security. <br><br>  Ps Congratulations to EmerCoin on the conquest of another peak! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/310812/">https://habr.com/ru/post/310812/</a></p>
