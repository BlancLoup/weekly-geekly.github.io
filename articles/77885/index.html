I'll tell you in my own words without pretending to academic and scientific accuracy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/14a/136/d64/14a136d64a6eb5a49fe914651fddb0d0.jpg" alt="The role of sleep in the context of personal effectiveness"><br><br>  At night, during a full-fledged sleep, our brain filters everything that went through it during the day and either puts this thing in long-term memory (and then we remember it), or discards what we don't need in memory for various reasons.  The simplest example that illustrates this mechanism is a video tape recorder that rewinds back every night, then scrolls all day at the same speed (and this is an important point: the playback speed is approximately equal to the recording speed) and cuts out the pieces that it resets.  For this work, the brain needs about as much time as living the filled-in pieces of life itself (that is, not every breath in and out, but a topic, conversation, question, letter, line or block of code, test case, etc.).  There are people who have these processes go slower or faster, then they need to be acc.  less or more time to sleep.  But, on average in the hospital, if you work with brains for hours 8, then you need to sleep the same 8 hours.

      From here is a simple direct rule and not a very obvious rule, the opposite, about which we will discuss further. <br><br>  A direct rule: how much work, so much sleep. <br>  <b>The converse rule: how many slept, and worked so much.</b> <br><br>  If you slept for 3 hours at night and went to work ‚Äúhearty‚Äù, then in your presence there is a ‚Äútape cassette‚Äù, which is only free for 3 hours. <a name="habracut"></a>  You can try to ‚Äúwrite on top‚Äù, that is, having 3 hours left, with an effort to cram new information on top: what exactly you ‚Äújammed‚Äù you do not control, moreover, at this time the efficiency of work drops dramatically, as certain memory mechanisms try to fight with such barbaric treatment with still unfiltered information.  It turns out that having slept for 3 hours, in most cases you will work exactly the same 3 hours, and then you ‚Äúdrive a monkey‚Äù, that is, you walk, smoke, poke on the Internet, get into subordinates or colleagues, and this is all right for science.  We all remember that man is such a ridiculous creature that he simply cannot do anything.  If there is absolutely nothing to fill the empty time, then the person will invent something for himself - that is, he will see in the world around him something for which the brain can be hooked: a colleague is chewing loudly or tea from the corporate mug, someone chooses , ZP raised?), Etc. <br><br>  Note that if we are talking about programmers, managers and other comrades of mental labor, then the active work of the brain somewhere 8 hours a day should be obtained.  For some comrades, the recording-playback process is faster or slower, so some have 6 or even 3-4 hours of sleep, although it may turn out that they are just enough because they then work for 3-4 hours :) <br><br>  What to do if it is impossible to sleep for 8 hours and to work as many hours as you slept, also fails.  Sleep in such a truncated mode, at least in time slots of multiples of 1.5 hours.  That is, if you get up at 6:00, and now at 23:00, then it is better to go to bed closer to 00:00 than now.  It‚Äôs not possible to work this way for a long time.  It is possible, but your productivity will be much lower than you can afford for yourself with your wonderful brain. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77885/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77885/</a></p>
