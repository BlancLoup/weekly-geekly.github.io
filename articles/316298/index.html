  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How they wrote their first game and what mistakes could have been avoided. Part 1. Idea</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><blockquote>  <i>"I learned from mistakes</i> <i><br></i>  <i>any brilliantly repeat "</i> <i><br></i> <br>  Internet sage </blockquote><p>  Do not judge strictly.  I'm just an office plush cat and my notes do not pretend to be scientific papers.  I just wanted to share my observations, mistakes and blunders made during the development of the game, in the hope that someone could save their time, nerves and become a bit kinder. </p><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  Programmers - lovers of difficult puzzles with easy otgadki, probably therefore very often, deep in the soul, we remain children until the deepest old age.  What do children like?  And kids love toys!  And the idea is born to write your toy.  Naturally, it will be the most interesting and beautiful among all existing ones, because we have a lot of ideas and we can write good code.  Or is it not so simple? </p><br><p>  In this article I will try to tell you about the stages and mistakes made during the creation of the game under the iOS platform. </p><br><p>  So, let's begin.  Creating something new starts with an idea.  Our case was no exception.  As is the case, an idea is born under the impression of something.  It could be someone‚Äôs success, described colorfully and pertly, it could be a favorite game, in which there is a small flaw, correcting which, it would surely become a masterpiece along with ‚ÄúJakonda Smile‚Äù, it could be ... But this is not about .  The first rake we attacked was before we hit the road.  So: </p><br><p>  <b>Thinking through ideas is already the beginning of game development.</b>  <b>It is as important as any other stage.</b> </p><br><p>  As a child, when I watched American films, I really liked it when cool cops caught a scoundrel and, following Miranda‚Äôs rule, very quickly shouted to his ear: You have the right to remain silent.  Anything you say can and will be used against you ... </p><br><p>  So here.  All that you say in the beginning will have to be implemented at the end.  It is very dangerous to say too much, but not to finish speaking is also a bad option.  Describe the essence of the idea with words.  Write them down so that at any moment you can skim through your future masterpiece with your eyes and enjoy it.  Avoid the words: somehow, anyone, anything. <br>  Start your description of the idea with <b>the</b> game <b>genre</b> and <b>for whom</b> you are writing. </p><br><p>  <em>Platform</em>  <em>For children 15-30 years</em> </p><br><p>  Not bad.  It became a little clearer.  But do not stop at what has been accomplished and immediately begin to write code.  Early.  Now we need to find out <b>what we will do in this game</b> .  After all, we play to temporarily leave the real world and go on a journey or save the princess, win the cup, conquer the immense space. </p><br><p>  <i>The protagonist (of course the player) has to transport passengers from point A to point B. within a certain time on his space taxi.</i> </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/485/828/080/4858280802964f79af4bb04d0d8b846f.PNG" alt="image"></p><br><p>  Another thing!  Pictures are starting to appear in my head.  Someone may even mentally buzz mimicking the engine.  Everything, write code!  Not!  Early.  Now we need to think of what will force the user to start the game. </p><br><p>  <i>The focus will be on puzzles.</i>  <i>Storyline and nice graphics</i> </p><br><p>  Now we can say that the idea has taken shape, and now everyone who will participate in the project can briefly say what we will get at the end.  It is very important to write it all down.  Let it be 3 lines, but they should be not only in your head.  In the future, any changes will need to be made first of all in our documentation.  This will keep our project in order at any stage of development. </p><br><p>  Now you can proceed to the next stage: the description of the concept of the game.  But about this, we will talk in the next article. </p></div>
