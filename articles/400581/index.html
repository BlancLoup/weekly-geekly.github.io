But in some cases, developers, trying to present something revolutionary new, create very unusual and even strange gadgets.  We will talk about them today - good, a lot of similar devices are shown this year. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Hair Coach Smart Hair Brush </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HO5lkZQlNuw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Practically all women take care of their hair; men do not lag behind them either.  In fact, a successful hairstyle is able to decorate any person.  And on the contrary, disheveled, ugly hair is able to level beauty and charm.  This year, three companies joined together in order to show the world a smart hair brush called the Hair Coach.  Specialists from Kerastase, Withings and L'Oreal Research worked on this miracle of technology. <br><br>  Hair Coach has a large number of sensors that can detect damage to hair and places where you need to work with a brush especially carefully.  This device sends information about the combing process and the results to its own mobile application.

      The cost of this brush is $ 200. <br><br><h3>  Scarf mask with air quality assessment function </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yY8dZkZWako" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Scarf mask Wair is designed to protect its owner from harmful substances contained in the atmospheric air.  In addition, this system is able to determine air quality.  Send the resulting Wiar scarf to the app on your mobile phone.  This smart scarf closes (most likely it will be said that it is still a handkerchief) the owner‚Äôs nose and mouth.  Information obtained through a scarf can be shared on social networks with friends and family. <br><br><h3>  Vibrating shorts </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h7_oRErJwMA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  These smart clothes are designed so that their owners (or rather, owners) can better navigate the concrete jungle.  This is an unusual navigation device built into these shorts, which vibrates if a person needs to turn in one direction or another.  In addition, shorts let the carrier know about received SMS, missed calls or other important events.  If there are no notifications, then you can not look into the phone, right?  The creator of this smart clothes is the company Spinali Design. <br><br><h3>  Smart cane </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qdF0nxXagZ8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The French company Dring has developed a smart cane, which is positioned as an assistant to the elderly.  It automatically evaluates the daily activity of a person in order to identify deviations from the usual behavior.  For example, if the owner of the cane falls, the system recognizes this and sends an alarm message to the doctor, family or friends of the victim.  The message is sent via sms or email. <br><br><h3>  Sandals for virtual reality </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d10/d0c/f01/d10d0cf0126d974faf9cb55b8c0de78b.jpg" width="950"><br><br>  Taclim VR - shoes that are suitable only for traveling through virtual reality.  The inventors of this miracle of technology are Japanese developers from the company Cerevo.  Taclim VR not only tracks the wearer's movement in ordinary reality, in order to transfer this information to a computer system.  Smart shoes also provide feedback that allows a person to feel at home in virtual reality.  The Japanese tried to make it so that Taclim VR makes it possible for a person to feel the character of the surface on which he steps in virtual reality. <br><br><h3>  System to stimulate hair growth iGrow </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4c2/1aa/c0c/4c21aac0ca1d63325e43a7d7c46d5547.jpg" width="950"><br><br>  Apira Science has developed a helmet for people who do not want to lose their hair.  In general, this is a gadget for men, for the most part, although women can use it.  Smart helmet iGrow is equipped with a system of red lasers and LEDs, which, according to the developers, can stimulate hair growth.  The company claims that the laser beams stimulate the activity of hair follicles, which, under the influence of this factor, begin to function normally again. <br><br><h3>  Camera for refrigerator Smarter Fridge Cam </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e76/232/700/e76232700721a232458c4b17f6aaf365.jpg" width="950"><br><br>  Tired of looking in the fridge?  Smarter Fridge Cam camera will save you time.  She constantly monitors what is inside and sends the video stream and photos to the user's smartphone.  As a result, the owner of this device (and the refrigerator) can check at any time and from anywhere in the world what it has in the refrigerator and what it does not. <br><br><h3>  Think &amp; Learn Smart Cycle Exercise Bike </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/520/2c0/f2f/5202c0f2f1f5c28ad79c4af9bfc73dd8.jpg"><br><br>  The company Fisher-Price decided to create a smart exercise bike for kids, which allows them to develop (physically and mentally) by riding a virtual reality exercise bike.  The exercise bike connects to your tablet, Smart-TV or any other mobile device on Android or iOS. <br><br>  For training, applications are used - both developed by the company itself and from third-party developers.  For example, you can work with programs such as Sponge Bob Square Pants and Shimmer and Shine.  This is the second iteration of the Fisher-Price clever exercise bike.  The first was introduced in 2007. <br><br>  According to the developers, the system helps children play their favorite games without staying in one place.  Think &amp; Learn Smart Cycle will appear later this year at a price of about $ 150. <br><br><h3>  Smart whistle geko </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b59/05e/c6d/b5905ec6dbb6432d2f3067cadaec6e07.png" width="950"><br><br>  Another strange device - a smart whistle.  When the owner blows into it, Geko sends the text, calls or sends an e-mail message to the contacts pre-registered in the contact list.  The message also indicates the location of the owner of the whistle, plus the acoustic accompaniment of what is happening around is recorded. <br><br><h3>  Boxer shorts with protection from harmful radiation </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c95/023/49c/c9502349c4510638d47e80f40208a0b5.jpg" width="950"><br><br>  Neither the smart hairbrush nor the whistle compares in its utility with the Spartan boxer shorts.  They, according to the creators, protect the owner from harmful radio emission.  Wi-Fi, cellular signals, that's all ... Spartan protects a person, for example, from the radiation of a phone in his pocket.  According to the author of the idea, this radiation may well have a negative effect on the fertility of men.  Well, and cowards protect from all this and fertility remains at the same level.  This is how it is. <br><br>  By the way, these pants received on Indiegogo 189% of the amount that was needed by the developers to start production of this type of clothing. <br><br>  In general, at CES this year, far from only strange and unusual gadgets are presented.  There are many excellent devices that are worth talking about in more detail.  We managed to try out some of them personally, and we will definitely tell you about our impressions about electronic devices and the exhibition itself. <br><hr><br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dces_second"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d29/4c3/07d/d294c307dde04335ac3f425e73b36a7a.gif"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/about/mails/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dces_second"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7fa/417/fe3/7fa417fe3d464fa5aa186b1ab30da53a.gif"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/400581/">https://habr.com/ru/post/400581/</a></p>
