  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sysadmin day. How was it</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For the fourth time in the last weekend of July, the All-Russian Meeting of Sysadmins takes place.  Rally organized Mail.Ru and Softline.  The organizers declared three thousand participants, by eye there were more, approximately, by a thousand.  At the very first meeting of the system administrators, there were 350 people, and this weekend 10 times more. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f5e/22e/4b5/f5e22e4b59d20ce056dd8554ce4057b6.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Arriving on Friday at a gathering of sysadmins, at one in the morning, we in the dark with the help of flashlights camped, and tried to find firewood at night in the forest, but found beer and new neighbors.  Everyone who registered for the rally and confirmed the registration was given T-shirts with the main symbol of the rally - crossed-out kettles. <br>  On Saturday morning, it all started with admin charging.  Particularly memorable exercise "chasing lamer" and "fighting strut Heron to fend off users."  Those who could withstand exercise - poured kefir.  Kefir after Friday was very popular, but they poured it strictly 100 grams in one hand. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a5/c0d/c50/7a5c0dc50eb7896e8c79ce1862103c77.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The official opening was without long speeches, but with the warm words of the organizers and sponsors.  Which was followed by the admin anthem and the raising of the flag. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b07/007/b3e/b07007b3e28f31bb47198d4da88935d6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Director of Softline Internet Business Development, Roman Agafonov, beats a tambourine at the opening of the rally. <br><br>  The number of computer utensils at the rally exceeded all possible limits.  In its various variations, mice, keyboards of various prescription, monitors and other understandable and not very devices. <br><img src="http://s48.radikal.ru/i121/0908/b9/6e5cc163d3c6.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b28/3b8/219/b283b82199d80a81e5bb8818ed1ca0e1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Even the rain, which lasted 4 hours, did not knock down the mood of everyone who was at the rally, but added chachi underfoot decently.  In some places it was possible to smear ankle-deep and how to turn up. <br>  Here in this place I would like to note the forethought of Mail.Ru they had raincoats.  By the way, it is strange that manufacturers of antiviruses did not have raincoats. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/23f/99e/68d/23f99e68db75a383949d23ba9006479e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  But antiviruses had hardware virus destruction and hardware quarantine. <br><br>  Block sporting events. <br><img src="http://i056.radikal.ru/0908/26/7588b4403ece.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Two are walking along the clearing. <br>  - How do we call the team? <br>  - Well, come on admins. <br>  - Are you a fool?  Come on cucumbers!

      Admin contests for throwing mice and keyboards that have become traditional, raising the admin bar. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/94f/8e4/e22/94f8e4e228d7df965c0f088bc5d3725c.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://i065.radikal.ru/0908/34/bb0b50db9071.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The program also included a rock concert, a burning effigy of a lamer on a big admin fire, fireworks and a disco. <br><br>  The meeting was organized at a very good level, water and firewood were brought several times a day (have you ever seen 10 cubic meters of firewood disappear in 2 minutes in a clearing?), The doctors were constantly on duty.  On the stage, almost all the time the feedback worked. <br>  - Found a Samsung brand mobile phone like that. <br>  - Lost cell phone Nokia N72.  If you have such a phone in your pocket, please bring it to the stage. <br>  - Found the keys to the car Ford.  Lost the keys, please go to the scene, and also check the availability of your car in the parking lot. <br><br>  The most important part of any gathering is its atmosphere, the mood of both the organizers and the participants.  Here it is almost impossible to convey in words, but very, very ‚Äúuser-friendly‚Äù and ‚Äúpositive maximum‚Äù.  Almost every campfire in front of the guest suddenly had a mug or baclag with beer. <br><br>  Thank you for the holiday Softline and Mail.Ru, sponsors and all involved in the preparation and holding of the event.  Intuition suggests that in a few years this glade will become small for everyone. <br>  Once again, congratulations on the past holiday of all system administrators. <br>  <b>PS</b> Someone tell me the meaning of the phrase "High technology is so high." <br>  <a href="http://www.sletadminov.ru/about/photo_video/slet2009/">Another photo</a> . <br>  <a href="http://foto.mail.ru/corp/ilyichev/15">And more photos</a> <br>  <a href="http://kanobu.ru/blog/id10232/">Post colleagues we went</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66037/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66037/</a></p>
