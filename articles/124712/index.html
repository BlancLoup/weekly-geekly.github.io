  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Best practices & foreign customers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Naturally, everyone heard about the so-called ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù.  Now it is fashionable.  But for some reason this expression is mentioned only in conjunction with some kind of loud foreign brand.  It seems that only they have the ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù.  Despite this, we can already say with confidence that our companies also form the best practices in their respective fields. <br><br>  It is clear that we will not give you a recipe for instant success.  At the same time, we consider important the process of sharing experiences.  Many would agree that in the work of any organization one can always find those moments that could be shared or borrowed.  We do not exclude the fact that we are unlikely to succeed in ‚Äúdiscovering America.‚Äù  However, we consider it necessary to reach a dialogue with readers and exchange views on the topic. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The fact that the Ukrainian company managed to persuade foreigners to sign contracts already indicates the presence of some developments.  Indeed, unlike the south-east outsourcing, the Ukrainian engineer is no different with cheapness.  Here you will not take one level of personnel skills, if only because it is necessary to take into account intercultural differences, and indeed have decent flexibility.  There are a lot of customers, and everyone has their own interest.  And it is necessary to correspond to all.  What is the intrigue?  In our opinion, in such a simple formula: <br><br>  Personnel + Knowledge + Quality of processes + Security = Customer attraction and retention. 
      <br>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      For example.  It goes without saying that it is not enough to recruit qualified engineers alone.  A strong management team is needed for them, because it is not enough to have competence available - it also needs to be sold.  At the same time, the manager, who heads the strategic direction, must be aware of the business not only well, but very well.  And we believe that this can not be achieved without having worked for a sufficient time in a particular environment.  That is why, on average, the backbone of our company's management has been working for us at least five years.  Personnel stability is one of the factors that can debug business processes like a clock.  It should also be noted that the career of the majority of managers developed in our organization.  Is it worth constantly ‚Äúlooking for talents‚Äù on the side, if you can develop a professional right within the walls of the company? <br><br>  The same goes for technicians.  Stability of teams in itself means a lot, and on long-term projects this is almost a third of success.  Surely, many of you have had experience in companies, which seem to be quite good, but the issues of loyalty are peculiar.  As if it should be the default as the duty of the employee.  For which we paid for staff turnover, which we try to avoid to the maximum.  At the same time, there is a different effect - the return of employees who for some reason left the company.  Determining the right domestic policy is very important.  We believe this can be easily attributed to the best practices.  As well as the fact that managers have an up-to-date list of currently available competencies that will not disappear anywhere either tomorrow or in a month.  This is what helps to ensure flexibility, and rapid assessment of readiness for any project. <br><br>  It is said that such things as ITIL and ISO 9001: 2008 help to manage the enterprise.  What can we say - really help.  The description, as well as, examples of the use of these things have been touched many times in many articles and diagrams.  And still helps such a formalization.  This, you know, when any process is described in detail in steps on a certain document - a process model as one of the examples.  And it seems that everyone has one, but not everyone uses it.  In a word, use.  Also helpful. <br><br>  Or, for example, such an aspect as information security.  It would seem, why it is necessary.  But it so happens that the client feels much calmer when she is - than when vice versa.  They say, in particular, that Ukraine is in the ranking of corruption, if not in third place, then somewhere close.  Lie of course.  But the customer is still easier when implemented clear and understandable schemes for information security.  Then you will even be allowed to open RDP to the customer, and this is a guarantee of great and strong love. <br><br>  Roughly speaking, it was possible not to write all this.  And just draw such a sign with a list of factors that, in our opinion, will help you attract and retain foreign customers: <br><ul><li>  Stable work organization thanks to a strong management team </li><li>  Providing a wide range of knowledge within the company </li><li>  Introduction of a quality management system </li><li>  Formalization and documentation of processes </li><li>  Use advanced IT security solutions </li></ul><br>  It is still visible and understandable.  And finally, I would like to wish all IT companies to develop, achieve success in attracting and collaborating with foreign customers.  In the end, all of us, IT specialists, always want to work with interesting projects and gain invaluable experience working with colleagues from other countries. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124712/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124712/</a></p>
