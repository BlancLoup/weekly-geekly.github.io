  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What lessons should Ubuntu learn to successfully enter the mobile market?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A couple of months ago, Mark Shuttleworth announced on his blog that Ubuntu April 14 (April 2014) will work on tablets, mobile phones and televisions. <br>  The announcement was greeted with surprise and some criticism.  Some people were happy to see Unity on their phones and tablets, while others consider it a mistake.  Regardless of their reactions, we all know that entering the mobile market will be very difficult when another Linux-like operating system known as Android rules the market.  However, Ubuntu, taking its first steps into the world of mobile phones, tablets and televisions, can learn a lot from the mistakes of competitors. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Unity must live up to its name.</b> <br>  Unity should try to stay true to its name as much as possible.  In other words, Canonical must ensure that tablets, televisions, and mobile phones have similar interfaces and applications. <br>  <b>Make life easier for the developer.</b> <br>  For Ubuntu, if it wants to leave its mark on the mobile market, you need to think about developing a quality SDK from the very beginning.  If they do not, they will have to put up with an empty app store in the future.  Canonical must also ensure that developers can monetize their applications from day one.  If Ubuntu can attract a sufficient number of developers, then there are chances to become a competitor of Android and IOS. <br>  <b>No beta tests on users.</b> <br>  Canonical, at any cost, should refrain from half-baked releases, as it was with Unity.  You can not abuse the term "this is new" and develop the OS, using users as beta testers.  Canonical needs to be aware of the high competition in the mobile market and in order to get the user to vote for Ubuntu with a wallet, it should be better than others. <br>  <b>Caution in the design.</b> <br>  The design team must be very careful when designing to avoid any patent warrior with Apple, Android and Microsoft.  The user interface design must be unique and not violate any patents, otherwise ships cannot be avoided. <br>  <b>Make one device but damn well</b> <br>  There are currently thousands of Android devices on the market.  Many of them sell well, but what really attracts consumers is the Samsung Galaxy Nexus, which is a showcase for attracting a large number of users to the platform. <br>  When Android appeared, he had nothing to brag about.  With the release of the Nexus One, and subsequently the Nexus S, consumers and developers have tried out this platform.  The same thing is happening now with Windows Mobile.  Windows Phone OS, which had a sluggish start, finally began to gain momentum thanks to the Nokia Lumia 800. <br>  Ubuntu should also make a good machine at the beginning of the journey to attract users and developers.  Partner, it is desirable to choose a major manufacturer, Dell or Samsung, crossing the best part of the hardware with the software. <br>  <b>Provide tight control over applications</b> <br>  Currently, malware, trojans and bad apps appear in the Android Marketplace.  And this is a disadvantage of Android, for example, if you compare it with iOS, where applications added to the App Store are more tightly controlled.  All the blame is that the appearance of malware lies with Google, which uses a liberal approach to application developers. <br>  Some people might argue that if you put more control on it, it would jeopardize the openness of the platform.  However, it is not.  Tight control should be at the stage when the developer submits an application for review.  Google, despite its billions of dollars, does not have a decent screening for apps that are being added to the Android Market.  This in turn stimulates a huge jump in "shit" programs. <br>  Ubuntu should avoid this error.  The application must be verified by a person and only after that published in the online store.  This will slow down the growth of the list of available applications, but it will relieve unwanted software in the future. <br>  To summarize, it should be said that this will not be an easy path for Ubuntu.  He will have to fight with such giants as Apple, Google and Microsoft.  However, if Canonical accomplishes the plan, it will be a huge victory not only for the Linux community, but also for Shuttleworth, who has been criticized recently for its decisions. </div>
