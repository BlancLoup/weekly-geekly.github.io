And since our task is to make them more profitable than they are now, we even know more details than anyone else, because  Often we compare data before we start work and after it. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Small business or any new project often lives on the verge of payback - Barnaul is not a very solvent city compared to Novosibirsk or Moscow.  If you organized a business, it does not mean that the market will bring you to wealth.  In Moscow can.  There, everything goes much more actively, but in Barnaul it is not a fact, it is necessary to flounder, perhaps for a long time. <br><br>  Example: a friend went to work in Novosibirsk, says heaven and earth.  In Barnaul you are calling someone with a cool offer, they say, let's cooperate, we can give you good conditions.  And the answer in the phone is that we don‚Äôt need anything, and so well.  And in Novosibirsk at once, ‚ÄúWell, well, well, show what you have, let's see!‚Äù.  Barnaul is not very active in business terms. <br><br>  So what to do?  Options for such.  For a new project, all of them are possible only if the market is not oversaturated: <br><ul><li>  Do something that others can not.  On the example of my neighbor - to organize the production of insulation for pipes.  Not everyone has several million investments.  But if you take a loan, he will quickly return.  Of course, you need to know the market.  Or here's another example - men are sitting in an office, something they are doing (I went to the site negotiations).  We discuss sales, marketing, and one of them sits and solves a strategic task, 50 or 60 archers to send to the attack.  They found their niche, they are fine.  And then bought a sample of bitumen.  Even without a tractor, only a trailer (for real money, not leased, that is, they had one).  And he as give them grandmother to bring.  Well, they ponabrali some more.  And your previous business (also non-stressed) was abandoned.  Now the largest carrier of fuels and lubricants in Altai.  In just a couple of years they have become so. </li><li>  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãsomething to other regions (do not count on your city).  In some cases, finding a buyer somewhere in Russia is easier than in Barnaul (if we talk about my city).  Especially if the goods are such that they are ready to order in other regions, then this is great!  You can sell something that is produced in Altai (for example, Altai honey is already a recognizable brand in itself), and there is still an option to bring something from China and sell in Russia.  My friend bought a machine for printing advertising banners.  He was offered it for 1 million 200 thousand, but it cost 600 thousand directly from China. But not everyone will order directly from China. </li><li>  Find a market where there is low competition and high demand.  And hit the jackpot.  But to find such a difficult, although I saw this.  Probably, the example with bitumen can also be attributed here. </li><li>  Do it right, not through the ass.  A service like zappos, ingenious marketing, to hire people who want to do their job really well, etc ... It will almost always work.  And if it is to impose on other items, it will work very cool. </li></ul><br><br>  Although, by the way, often the business operates without profit due to very different reasons.  Sometimes you just need to count how much revenue there is and how much it costs and throw out unprofitable directions.  It seems banal, but many often just laziness. <br><br>  Successes!  I hope everyone will succeed! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/179655/">https://habr.com/ru/post/179655/</a></p>
