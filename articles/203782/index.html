  <section class="page js-page"><h1>5 typical questions of a novice IT entrepreneur</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  All start-up entrepreneurs are asked the same questions.  Some of these quiet questions are quite simple, some of the questions are relevant for beginners, but in future work, knowing the correct answer is no longer useful.  However, often asking a question to an experienced entrepreneur can avoid some mistakes in the first steps in the business.  Unfortunately, there are no right answers to the most difficult questions, but even here the recommendations and personal experience of those who have already encountered similar problems can help.  Will they help you?  Quite possible.  At the very least, you'll know what worked in a similar situation. <br>  About a third of the members of <a href="http://smartsourcing.ru/">the SmartSourcing community</a> are owners, co-owners or leaders of small IT companies.  During the three years of the community‚Äôs existence, some of the regular participants have managed to go all the way from newcomers in the business to quite successful IT entrepreneurs.  We have enough ‚Äúmentors‚Äù who are ready to discuss a variety of problems and situations.  The newly registered members of the community each month ask one or another question about the first steps in the IT business.  The wording may vary, but the meaning remains the same.  For three years, we have accumulated dozens of such discussions and hundreds of responses. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://habr.habrastorage.org/post_images/f7d/ff3/1c0/f7dff31c09d908632177a17e26c9cf69.png"></div><br>  We summed up these discussions in the mini-book " <a href="http://smartsourcing.ru/blogs/organizatsiya_i_razvitie_biznesa/2434">How to start your own IT business</a> ."  We hope that it will answer many questions, entrepreneurs starting a business related to IT outsourcing and computer service.  However, everyone else will also find a lot of useful things in it.  And most importantly, this book has several dozen authors, since  most of the answers given by community members. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The book retains the original spelling and vocabulary (offensive language is not used, although it sometimes suggests itself).  It would be possible to rewrite these answers in a ‚Äúliterary‚Äù form, but the ‚Äúauthenticity‚Äù of these tips will suffer from such an action. <br>  The full text of the mini-book " <a href="http://smartsourcing.ru/blogs/organizatsiya_i_razvitie_biznesa/2434">How to start your own IT business</a> " is available free of charge in the Smartsourcing community. <br>  And here I offer a few characteristic questions and answers from among those regularly asked by novice IT entrepreneurs. <br><br><h4>  1. SP or LLC? </h4><br>  Probably the most popular question that anyone who first opens a business is asked of.  This question is just from simple.  The success of the subsequent business is almost independent of the decision made.  In short, then: <br><ul><li>  Both PI and LLC can hire employees.  It is unlikely that in the first year you will reach the limit values ‚Äã‚Äãfor the FE. </li><li>  Both the PI and the LLC are accounting and tax accounting and submit reports, but with IP this is easier. </li><li>  If you register an individual entrepreneur today, you will need to contribute approximately 100 rubles to the Pension Fund and the Federal Fund for Health Insurance Fund for each remaining day until the end of 2013.  In 2014, if your income is less than 300 thousand rubles, your contributions will amount to 20,727.53 rubles.  In addition, you will need to make a contribution of 1% of the amount that exceeds 300 thousand rubles.  Owners of LLCs do not have mandatory contributions - there is no income, and there are no payments. </li><li>  The individual entrepreneur freely disposes of all the money earned (minus taxes and fixed insurance premiums).  In the LLC, even the sole proprietor cannot formally spend the money the way he wants, but in practice, the difference can only be in the need for proper execution of expenses. </li><li>  The SP is responsible for the results of its activities with all its assets.  In practice, this is not as bad as it sounds, because  Article 446 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation contains a rather large list of property of individual entrepreneurs for which a penalty cannot be levied.  For example, if we act strictly according to the law, then a single apartment cannot be taken away from an individual entrepreneur. </li><li>  Ltd. is responsible only in the amount of the share capital.  However, in practice there may be exceptions and different legal tricks.  For example, a lawsuit can be brought not to the LLC, but personally to you, as to the director. </li></ul><br><h4>  2. The choice of taxation system: general, simplified or patent? </h4><br>  If you do not know why you need a general taxation system, and you do not plan to hire a professional accountant on your staff from the first day, then you should not get involved with it. <br>  The simplified tax regime over the past few years has lost some of its attractiveness for start-up entrepreneurs.  Accounting in the minimum form will have to lead.  There is nothing complicated in tax and accounting, especially with a small number of monthly bills.  I recommend using one of the cloud accounting services.  However, you may still need to consult an accountant. <br>  <strong>2.a 6 or 15%</strong> <br>  The simplified tax system has two options: <br><ul><li>  <strong>6% of all revenues.</strong>  An IE without workers can reduce that tax on the full amount of insurance premiums to the Funds.  Individual entrepreneurs with employees and LLCs can reduce this tax by no more than 50% due to contributions to the Funds.  This option is convenient for business related to the provision of services. </li><li>  <strong>15% income minus expenses.</strong>  A limited list of possible expenses is listed in the Tax Code.  It is necessary to keep a record of these expenses.  In general, this approach is beneficial for the business associated with trade, as well as for companies in which the documented costs (of those included in the NK list) account for more than 60% of revenues. </li></ul><br>  The patent system, which has replaced UTII since 2013, is not very convenient for IT business.  Most IT business options do not fit well into the activities that the patent system implies.  For example, an item such as ‚Äúother services of a production nature‚Äù is suitable for IT business.  Confused only by the estimated income of 900 thousand rubles and the presence in the explanatory list of services such as stripping of croup and smoked sausages, far from computers.  In most other patent options, the same income limits are set, so it‚Äôs simpler and cheaper to use the usual simplified form for the PI.

    <h4>  3. Do I need an office? </h4><br>  First of all, I would like to give you back that question - why do you need an office?  Chew ChSV?  There are many less costly options.  At first, you definitely do not need an office in order to show it to customers.  In the extreme case, if you need to ‚Äúthrow dust in your eyes‚Äù, find a business center in which you can rent a conversation for 1-2 hours. <br>  In a small IT service business, you do not need an office, but a separate room for work.  That, in which you can bring a computer from a client, then where you can work with him calmly, etc.  You can do it all at home, in the "garage" or in the barn - great.  No, choose a cheap and convenient option.  Since you will not be visited by crowds of customers every day, you can consider the option of renting an apartment - most likely it will be cheaper than a ‚Äúclassic‚Äù office. <br>  That's what you need for sure - a working mobile phone with an unlimited tariff. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://habr.habrastorage.org/post_images/265/e5d/d8f/265e5dd8fef4964a2f1dd264e5911531.png"></div><br><h4>  4. Is it possible to earn on this?  Does PC service provide enough profit? </h4><br>  A huge number of IT companies prove by the fact of their existence that this line of business can be profitable.  However, start-up entrepreneurs regularly face the fact that they can only earn money on ‚Äúpre-shirak‚Äù.  Why it happens? <br><ul><li>  Mistake number 1 - entrepreneurs are trying to attract customers with low prices and get involved in dumping wars in the cheapest segment of the market.  As a result, no matter how much they work, it‚Äôs impossible to enter a profitable business.  This is the way to fail the business.  Do not start a business with customers who are not willing to pay.  It is better to spend time and effort on finding the client who agrees to the minimum acceptable rate for you. </li><li>  Mistake number 2 - a bet on one-time services.  Permanent contracts with corporate clients (small and medium business, state organizations, etc.) and the sale of additional services to them in excess of the subscription fee work well in service.  One-time work with individuals is much more difficult and less profitable business.  There are "entrepreneurs" who specialize in the "divorce" of individuals due to "tuning and repairing computers."  Only for the IT business is no longer relevant. </li></ul><br>  Members of <a href="http://smartsourcing.ru/">the SmartSourcing community</a> recommend initially to determine the minimum necessary income, and on their basis to determine the rates and price ranges.  This rate will allow you to grow normally and grow your business.  If it turns out to be more than the market average, it will be harder for you to search for customers.  But your efforts will pay off. <br><br><h4>  5. At what rate to offer their services? </h4><br>  There are two main approaches based on the cost of 1 PC and the cost of 1 hour of work: <br>  Surveys of community members over the past few years have given virtually unchanged rates for the cost of servicing 1 PC: <br><ul><li>  "Doshirak" - less than 500 rubles </li><li>  "Cheap services" - from 500 to 700 rubles </li><li>  "Average offer" - from 700 to 1000 rubles </li><li>  "Premium offer" - over 1000 rubles </li></ul><br>  At the same time, in small towns the cost of services is usually lower than in megacities.  So, in the 2013 survey, only companies from million-plus cities worked in the ‚Äúpremium‚Äù segment. <br>  The second approach is the hourly rate.  For example, a novice entrepreneur (6%) wants to receive at least 30,000 rubles a month ‚Äúclean‚Äù.  He will need 3,000 rubles (simplified) monthly contributions to the Funds.  In a normal situation, the payroll will not exceed 60% of the income.  Those.  for the month you need to earn 55,000 rubles. <br>  You are unlikely to work more than 30-40% of the working time per month (and this is still a lot).  Get ready for the main working hours on weekends and evening hours.  The main focus, at least until you have enough regular customers, will have to pay attention to sales, marketing, negotiations, etc. <br>  Those.  You can receive payment no more than 55-65 hours per month.  Total your hourly rate will be 850-1000 rubles.  It fits the average for servicing 1 PC, but not always PC maintenance work can be completed in 1 hour. <br><h4>  <strong>6 and more ...</strong> </h4>  More detailed answers to these questions in our mini-book " <a href="http://smartsourcing.ru/blogs/organizatsiya_i_razvitie_biznesa/2434">How to start your own IT business</a> ."  In addition, there are issues related to the first sales, negotiations with customers, marketing for a small company, combining business and employment, recruitment and much more. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/203782/">https://habr.com/ru/post/203782/</a></p>
