    <h4>  The conference </h4><br>  Unfortunately, we managed to attend only the conference.  The hall for 150 people was half full, taking into account the fact that the event fell on a working day.  The reports were excellent.  Especially pleased with the demonstration of Java FX and Java ME Embedded on the Raspberry Pi.  And, of course, a robot with Java ME Embedded on board. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/726/36c/345/72636c3450438d91c06adf4344e801f6.jpg"><br><br>  Conference materials are available <a href="http://javaone.ru/data/JavaDaySamara2013/">here</a> . <br><br>  It should be noted that this is the first JavaDay in Samara.  On the local TV channel even showed the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Ffeature%3Dplayer_embedded%26v%3D7ELwL4X3e_A">corresponding plot</a> .  That fact is interesting that Microsoft TechDays pass already for a long time, but not so with that scope.  Let's hope that IT events of this format will be a regular occurrence.  A Java movement will gain momentum. <br><br>  And finally, the most delicious - the tournament tasks, kindly provided by their creator - Pavel Vasin.  The texts of the tasks left unchanged.  Below are the answers. <br><br><h4>  Tournament </h4><br>  The task of the tournament was to identify not just candidates with knowledge of mathematics and skills in sports programming, but people who are closer to production.  Therefore, the first task was academic: knowledge of the Java language, knowledge of good and especially bad practices in the industrial implementation of tasks, support, object-oriented programming and class design.  The second task - a practical, on the result, time-consuming and without academic.  How to do, so well.  A hint system was developed for it.  Here the task was that people themselves set the task and choose the tools for its solution.  At the same time, they correctly estimated and distributed their time; if they could not cope or did not have time, they would take clues. <br><br><h5>  Exercise 1 </h5><br><blockquote>  Imagine that you perform code review in a very large company that develops software for the needs of the space industry.  Requirements for reliability, speed, quality of the developed software are the highest. <br><br>  Review the code presented on the printout, and in the table, the template of which is attached, indicate all the errors made in the code, inaccuracies, potential problems, etc.  The more problems you find, the better.  Each problem inherent in the code, the error has a certain "weight" in points.  Your task is to score the maximum number of points in this test. </blockquote><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Problem code</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><pre><code class="java hljs"><span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">01</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span></span> <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span></span></span><span class="hljs-class"> </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-title">EmployeeList</span></span></span><span class="hljs-class"> </span><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">extends</span></span></span><span class="hljs-class"> </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-title">LinkedList</span></span></span><span class="hljs-class"> </span><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">implements</span></span></span><span class="hljs-class"> </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-title">List</span></span></span><span class="hljs-class"> </span></span>{ <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">02</span></span> <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">//   03 public static final Float _baseHourSalary = new Float("36.60"); 04 public static final Float _high_hour_salary = _maxHourSalary / 4; 05 public static final int _maxHourSalary = _high_hour_salary &gt; 50 ? 110 : 55; 06 public Log log = LogFactory.getLog(); 07 private float[] koefs; 08 09 public EmployeeList() { 10 LoadKoefficients(); 11 } 12 13 @Override 14 public boolean add(Object o) { 15 for (Object obj : this) { 16 if (!(obj instanceof Employee)) continue; 17 if (o.equals(obj)) return false; //  ,     18 if (((Employee)o).getFio() == "  " 19 || ((Employee)o).getFio() == "  ") { 20 //  3244,       21 return false; 22 } 23 } 24 return add(o); 25 } 26 27 public void LoadKoefficients() { 28 float[] arr1 = KoefStorage.getKoefArray("ifns_2003_god"); 29 log.debug("   " + arr1.toString()); 30 float[] arr2 = KoefStorage.getKoefArray("ufns_2003_god"); 31 koefs = new Float[2000]; 32 for (int i = 0; i &lt; arr1.length; i++) koefs[i] = arr1[i]; 33 for (int i = 0; i &lt; arr2.length; i++) koefs[i + arr1.length] = arr2[i]; 34 recalculateKoeffs(); //     35 } 36 37 public void recalculateKoeffs() { 38 for (int i = 0; i &lt; koefs.length; i++) 39 koefs[i] = koefs[i] &lt; 0.88 ? koefs[i] / 4 : koefs[i] / 6; 40 } 41 42 public ArrayList getSalaries(LinkedList&lt;Employee&gt; employee) { 43 ArrayList result = new ArrayList(5); 44 for (int i = 0; i &lt; employee.size(); i++) { 45 Employee e = employee.get(i); 46 if (!this.contains(e)) { 47 //     .      48 return new ArrayList(0); 49 } 50 Employee found = (Employee) this.get(this.indexOf(e)); 51 result.add( 52 found.getFio() == "  " //  53 ? _maxHourSalary : _baseHourSalary); 54 } 55 return result; 56 } 57 58 public LinkedList getSortedView() { 59 DataCollectionsHelper.sortBubble(this, new Comparator() { 60 public int compare(Object o1, Object o2) { 61 if (o1 instanceof Employee &amp;&amp; o2 instanceof Employee) { 62 return ((Employee)o1).getTableNumber() - ((Employee)o2).getTableNumber(); 63 } else return -1; 64 } 65 }); 66 return this; 67 } 68 }</span></span></code> </pre> <br></div></div><br><br><h5>  Task 2 </h5><br><blockquote>  In one of the stories of Conan Doyle, the great detective ran into a case that became a real test of his deductive method.  The key to the investigation was the solution of a special ciphered language of the ‚Äúdancing little men‚Äù with which the criminals kept their correspondence.  In the course of the case, Sherlock Holmes, using his method, was able to calculate how many dancing little men are included in one word, and also identified those who met most often.  Solving the meaning of the first word - ‚ÄúHow do messages begin?  Of course, with greetings, dear Watson!  This is elementary! ‚Äù- the detective easily calculated all the rest.  After that, he was able to participate in their correspondence and expose the gang. <br><br>  We suggest you to repeat his actions, but with the help of modern technology. <br><br>  You have: <br>  1) Computer, Java, IDE <br>  2) An uncomplicated encrypted excerpt of an artistic text in Russian <br>  3) The novel "War and Peace" L.N.  Tolstoy (if you have a lot of time after decryption, so that you have something to do, you can read a little) <br>  4) A set of 3 tips (‚Ññ1, ‚Ññ2, ‚Ññ3) that open in turn.  Opening each hint reduces the number of points you can get.

There are no line breaks, only letters of the Russian alphabet (in one register), punctuation marks, spaces.  The text is encrypted using the encryption method: when each source symbol replaces with one or a group of characters from a dictionary, the number of symbols in the group is the same for each encoded source symbol.  Conan Doyle had such a dictionary men, in our case, the letters of the English alphabet, numbers, spaces, and some special characters. <br>  It would seem that, without knowing the key for which the replacement was carried out, it is impossible to open this cipher ... But the problem is that in modern languages ‚Äã‚Äã(including Russian) different letters meet with different frequencies, some often, some rarely.  Therefore, such ciphers are amenable to so-called.  "Frequency analysis."  With a sufficiently large amount of text, the frequency will almost unambiguously determine the coded letter.  But since we have a small snippet encrypted, then there are some ‚Äúdistortions‚Äù in it, and for letters with similar frequencies, there will be uncertainty.  Well what can you do?  Again I remembered Sherlock - to substitute, try and try to solve some characteristic letter combinations or words, fix some "solved" letters and try again.  Each unraveled word will greatly bring you closer to unraveling the entire text.  And remember, the more conveniently you make the tool for such an analysis for yourself, the faster you will open the cipher. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Tip number 2</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  You do not have a table of frequencies of Russian letters?  And what do you Tolstoy?  Large text will give you a very accurate calculation of the frequency of use of letters in Russian.  Just do not forget to pre-process the text and normalize the resulting frequencies. <br>  It will also help a lot if you determine the most frequent symbol in the Russian text - the space and its frequency. <br>  We have agreed that in the cipher table each character of the source text can be encrypted with a group of characters?  How to know its size?  Here you can advise several ways: to analyze the frequency of occurrence of groups of characters in the encrypted text by a simple search, starting with 1. For the correct amount of frequency will be "special".  You can try to find the most frequently-occurring group of characters - it will be a space and it will restrict you to words.  Well, by the average word length, finding out the number of letters in a cipher group is easy (thanks again to Tolstoy). <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Tip number 3</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The encrypted text begins with the words "ANTON MIKHAILOVICH" <br></div></div><br><br><h5>  Answers </h5><br>  If the tasks could not be solved or there is simply a desire to verify the results, then you can use the answers: <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Answer to task 1</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Initially, a special table was created to evaluate this task, but then the task changed a little and the table became not entirely relevant.

I AM A HIGH-GROWTH, BADLY DOWN, I DRESS UP GRANDLY AND WITH TASTE, DON'T DRINK, I DON'T LIKE THE DOWNLOADS, BUT I DUMMY DAMAGED.  AND LADIES DO NOT AVOID ME.  EVEN LOVE WHEN I HAM WITH THEM.  SERAPHIM IZMAYLOVNA REQUESTS INVITED ME TO ITSELF, AND ZINAIDA YAKOVLEEV ALSO SAID THAT IT IS ALWAYS RADY TO SEE ME.  BUT HERE WITH THE MARINE PETROLEVAL CASE FUNNY HAS STILL AT ME WHICH I WANT TO TELL.  THE CASE IS FULLY ORDINARY, BUT ALSO FUN, FOR MARINA PETROVNA THANKS TO ME COMPLETELY FALSE, LIKE PALM.
