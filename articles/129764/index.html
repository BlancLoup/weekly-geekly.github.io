The new version of the portal represents a new mechanism for developing and adopting initiatives, which, theoretically, can be projected onto a real model of the state. <br><br>  The principal difference between the new version is the refusal from the post of President, the revision of the functions of Ministers and the introduction of the posts of Experts.  In the past, incompetent populists could be at the head of a virtual republic who are not well versed in issues, but managed to please the community.  Having received high posts once, they turned off their activity on the portal, leaving their fellow citizens to fend for themselves. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Now populism will not pass!  Experts and Ministers of AlterRussia are those who have shown more awareness, who have caused more trust from other citizens.  If the Expert or the Minister stops working or loses trust, they automatically lose their status.  They are replaced by other people. <br><br>  Agree, it would be very tempting to implement such a mechanism of rotation of power in real Russia? <br><br>  To implement the new power model, the following features have been added: <br><br><h4>  The system of delegation of votes. </h4><br><br>  Based on personal opinions about a particular citizen, AR users can entrust (delegate) their votes to other citizens - those whom they consider to be the most competent in matters of a particular ministry. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/5b8239eb/5d4b4271/80f618d1/ce943892.png"><br><br>  Thus, the ‚Äúreservoir‚Äù of experts and the ‚Äúreservoir‚Äù of Ministers are formed - the top users with the highest number of delegated votes and the top leaders in the number of delegated votes in a particular ministry, respectively. <br><br>  The experts are in charge of overseeing the development of initiatives.  Each of the experts has the right to refine any of the initiatives within his ministry and decide on whether to take the initiative to a vote in the current version. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/e16007ca/70117b83/ecb72ec4/0e8303c9.png"><br><br>  Ministers have all the rights of experts, and an additional right to make a final decision on initiatives within their ministry.  The decision of the minister (‚ÄúFOR‚Äù, ‚ÄúTAKE IT UP‚Äù or ‚ÄúREJECT‚Äù) is final, even if it contradicts the current results of citizens' voting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/340d5ad2/0ffd2f4e/93240f88/80a50346.png"><br><br><h4>  Mechanisms that increase the transparency of actions of citizens, experts and ministers </h4><br><br>  Information on the process of working on the initiative is available to every citizen of AR.  Functionality provides: <br><br><ul><li>  View the current status of the initiative: ‚Äúat the project stage‚Äù, ‚Äúat the voting stage‚Äù, ‚Äúsent for revision‚Äù, ‚Äúadopted‚Äù, ‚Äúrejected‚Äù. </li><li>  View the current voting result - for initiatives that are currently being voted on. </li><li>  View a list of voted AR citizens. </li><li>  View a list of experts who found the initiative worthy of a vote. </li><li>  View information about the Minister who made the final decision on the initiative. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/097edc50/80bc50a8/48466962/280bcd2b.png"><br><br><h4>  Initiative Decision Process </h4><br><br>  Immediately after being published on the portal, each initiative assumes the status of a ‚ÄúProject‚Äù.  At this stage, all citizens of AR can participate in the discussion, and experts can work on the text of the initiative, taking into account the opinions of citizens. <br><br>  After the group of experts has voted to take the initiative to the vote, the initiative takes the status of "Open to vote."  At this stage, citizens of AR vote on the initiative, choosing one of three options: ‚Äúfor‚Äù, ‚Äúagainst‚Äù, ‚Äúfor revision‚Äù. <br><br>  The final decision is made by the Minister of the ministry to which the published initiative belongs.  If a decision is made ‚ÄúFOR‚Äù, the initiative becomes the Law of the virtual republic of Alter Russia.  If the decision is ‚ÄúAGAINST‚Äù, the initiative is closed and enters the archive of rejected initiatives.  If the decision is ‚ÄúFINISHED‚Äù, the initiative returns to the revision stage by the Experts, after which the vote is reopened and the decision of the Minister is made again. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/72980c18/330be58f/a21c930d/3003d73b.png"><br><br>  PS <br><br>  Soon the project will introduce mechanisms for organizing political parties.  Supporters of various political views will be able to unite to work together to achieve their goals in the preparation of laws. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129764/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129764/</a></p>
