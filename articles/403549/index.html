  <section class="page js-page"><h1>As I left the programmers and started making hydroponic installations. DIY non-stop</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Hello!  I am a programmer from Ekaterinburg.  C #, ASP.NET.  I have 6 years of development experience.  But at some point I realized that this was not mine and decided to start creating hydroponic installations.  Under the spoiler a huge lyrical digression, which you can not read in principle (although I secretly hope so, and therefore I tried to write it interestingly and with good intentions). </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Lyrical digression</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><h2>  "... Why? Naaa-naa-na ..." From Zemfira's song "Why" </h2><br>  Decided to leave the programmers and do hydroponic installations?  In Ekaterinburg?  <b>But why?</b> <br><br><p>  And everything is simple: because I see trends, because I am looking for myself, because I decided to do something that, in my personal conviction, can become part of a happy future and a useful present for children and their parents now.  And most importantly, doing what I do not feel the internal resistance. </p><br><p>  In fact, I believe that everyone should do what he likes and in what he is ready to reach the heights due to the fact that he has the motivation to do it, passion, passion.  I think, figuratively, that in any business, like in love, if you do not make efforts, do not try, do not try to settle conflicts, do not see the good sides, do not show signs of attention, then in the end you will be left with nothing and love will go away.  Also in business, you love, you put effort, you yourself become better and you grow in it - you become professional, no - you do all kinds of nonsense, you get tired of work, you do not want to go to it, you suffer .. </p><br><p>  So, I saw that in the business that I was engaged in, there are a lot of people who do it better than me, those who are ready to dig into the code at night, to crawl through the thickness of the documentation and watch endless programming courses.  I saw that the world is eager for big data, artificial intelligence, neural networks and similar things, and I also saw that I was not going to figure it all out, well, that‚Äôs not interesting to me. </p><br><p>  I thought about what I would like to do so useful, what would I want to leave useful in my life? </p><br><p>  Yekaterinburg.  We have a difficult ecological situation, many would like to live in their home, have a garden, eat vegetables and fruits grown with their own hands.  But many do not want to dig in the dirt, go to the garden and do something there, spend the forces that are still at work, in order to weed and dig up the next bed.  And then I remembered something about hydroponics.  I opened a ‚Äúwell-known video service‚Äù and found a video where a man on the balcony built a hydroponic installation and after a month shows everyone how he‚Äôs growing there remarkably.  And then I realized that I want to build the same, and that, of course, I want to leave behind me a lot of useful hydroponic installations. </p><br><h2>  Kick in the ass.  To the stars </h2><br><p>  It is said that a correctly chosen path has a favorable beginning.  Well, in my way, there is something like this, if you look at it very much from a perverse point of view.  In January, I became ill with pneumonia, asked for leave at work, feeling unwell, I was told to go out when you were cured.  Well, I was sick for 14 days, after which I was safely kicked in the ass.  Honestly, the enthusiasm for work already somehow did not remain, so it was a logical outcome. </p><br><p>  And then I just thought <b>about the possibilities</b> . </p><br><p>  No, well, do not sit and cry?  I decided to do a hydroponic installation.  If everything worked out, then I planned to start selling these.  I wrote to the author of the above video, asked a bunch of questions and got down to business. </p><br></div></div><br><h2>  The end of the lyrical digression and the beginning of the practical offensive </h2><br><h2>  Hydro ... what? </h2><br><p>  Actually what is hydroponics?  This is a method of growing plants without using land.  Plant roots can safely receive nutrients from the water into which these substances can be introduced.  Next, the case for technology.  You can spray this water on the roots, you can periodically flood them, it is possible that the water flows through the roots.  Yes, a lot of things you can. <br><br>  There are many advantages:

Say no to dirt under your nails! </li><li>  No pests </li><li>  No weed </li><li>  Fresh air in the apartment, the plants improve it </li><li>  Mini eco-farm for children, as a guide for growing plants and respect for their own and other people's labor </li></ul><br>  I planted plants, periodically changing the nutrient solution, and <b>that's it</b> .  Rejoice and crunch grown cucumbers and bourgeois strawberries from their beds all year round. <p></p><br><h3>  Hydroponator G-1000 </h3><br><p>  The first installation came out beautiful, as in the watched video (for some reason I only had a photo of the flooded contour, but on the whole the installation looks like that).  I even recorded my video.  But it flowed from all the cracks.  And speaking seriously, she could kill me with electricity.  I smeared these crevices with my sealant, my fingers and everything they touched, but leaks appeared here and there.  In the end, I decided that it was necessary to choose a different material, thanks to which the installation could be disassembled and assembled.  With a sealant this would not work. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/469/564/6f3/4695646f3f8a522b6abc3c4d1977da71.jpg" alt="hydroponic plants to order, Yekaterinburg"><br><br><h3>  Someone sly and big </h3><br><p>  My father liked my experiments with the new installation and the suicide attempt by electric current and water, but apparently in my heart he was still worried that I could samovipilitsya and advised to use sewer pipes, which I did.  The leaks disappeared, it looked a little worse, but the installation of the G-1001 was almost ready and it was left to grow seedlings to plant it there. <br><br></p><p>  Radish from seedlings to prepare for landing in Norway </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a1f/9d9/e5e/a1f9d9e5eea072f2defa3494c5411526.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/333/15e/48e/33315e48ebf21095047326a1e2690414.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><p>  Actually G-1001 </p><br><ul><li>  Dimensions: length 135 cm, depth 35 cm, height 200 cm </li><li> Noise can be heard on the video, if you do not allow the solution to be underfilled, the noise is comparable to the work of a modern refrigerator.  And then, you can put the compressor less noisy, the water gurgles of course, but it is rather pleasant to the ear. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/806/1ba/6a6/8061ba6a6baf1c898c5028aaa8b5191b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://vk.com/video_ext.php" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  A little later, I added lighting to the installation and everything became even more attractive.  The first movers are now taking root in the installation - the tomatoes have already stretched a bit in length and it seems they are not going to wither.  The degree of dust and moisture protection lamps ip65.  All wiring is neatly laid.  The system turns on and off by timer. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6d0/e76/42c/6d0e7642c33008de145d60ad8aef691b.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3e2/821/3b2/3e28213b2bb6407957ea78656a37ed0c.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><h3>  Do it yourself.  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãit to somebody </h3><br><p>  Breathing from fatigue, I fell to my feet after the work I had done.  So you probably need to describe the programmer's transition from mental to physical-mental work.  But no, I felt great.  And when I bought the rack, and when I dragged it, and when I installed the pipes, and when I cut them, and when I dragged the installation with water from place to place.  Of course I'm tired, but not morally.  When you work for yourself, the things that you have to do for a business, you do as simple things during the day.  That's what I noticed.  You do not need to report to anyone, because you are your own boss. </p><br><p>  A little later, I received an order for the manufacture of two units of a different configuration, 1.5 by 2 meters in size.  With 24 containers of 11 liters each and a tank of 140 liters.  And watering in each of these tanks.  I certainly did not do these before.  But purchased and for the month they were made.  In order not to bore you with long stories, I post a photo report under the spoiler. </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Spoiler header</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/692/af2/b9d/692af2b9d6324f3a65efc14d180e02d7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dc9/51e/f7d/dc951ef7db8d4b67492c04b9d636ed66.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f15/074/2f1/f150742f1a270567a44c775771bac79f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/67a/0fd/b97/67a0fdb97ed050252615326d5dc8de3a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0d2/40d/455/0d240d4551b557a9038d9f3323d896a8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/203/c9e/d60/203c9ed602c5203ec28cc913875fcfd6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bcf/d82/9b3/bcfd829b30aacf39b624716307695598.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/763/884/8a9/7638848a9808d4b52b8a086e2c51cab5.jpg" alt="image"><br></div></div><br><h2>  Results </h2><br>  Everyone will find the meaning in this article by himself.  For me, it is that I want a hydroponic installation in every family, so that people eat quality products grown by their own (and a little by my) efforts.  So that they have clean air at home.  For their children to see nature at least in this form, and not just through computer monitors. <p></p><br><p>  And of course, I would like you to share this article, people found me and ordered the installation.  All the world and food without pesticides! </p></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403549/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403549/</a></p>
