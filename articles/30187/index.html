      However, if you use technologies that someone constantly calls "wrong" or "bad" - welcome to our "wrong" world (hellish laughter in the background). <br><br>  About 10 years ago, when I started creating websites, I first came across the fact that what I was doing was working, but it often turned out to be incorrectly working for many.  At that time, there was the ‚Äúbanners‚Äù mailing list, where anyone, even simple schoolchildren, whom I then was, could argue directly with Artemy Lebedev, Anton Voskresensky (the owner of LinkExchange.ru) and other leaders of RuNet. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  And then I made websites the laziest way for me - in FrontPage (can anyone else remember this).  It was then that I was first told that FrontPage is wrong, because it creates a lot of unnecessary markup, that instead of CELLPADDING = "5" you need to write cellpadding = 5, because browsers have long been unaware of quotes, incl.  Artemy Andreich insisted on this.  To be honest, I didn‚Äôt give a damn about the opinion of many then, but I remembered that it turned out to be ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù to write - as little as possible with pens, not visual programs.  Well, then there was not a large selection of tags, apparently only to find fault with it and it was possible. <br><br>  Fast forward to 2006 for a second and we find that it turns out that ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù HTML writing does not depend on quotation marks, but on what tags you use - TABLE or DIV.  And the word ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù became incorrect, therefore it was replaced with ‚Äúsemantic‚Äù spelling of HTML. <br><br>  Fast forward to 2008 - for the first time I made a website with a database of 100 million entries about 70 million sites (and if we normalize them, more than a billion entries on one regular server will turn out to be Pentium 4) and I did it in mySQL.  As it turns out, according to many people, this is also the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù database, I used it ‚Äúwrong‚Äù and CSS is my ‚Äúwrong‚Äù.  However, it works. <br><br>  Okay, back to the 90s.  One day I came across an interesting article by Yuri Moroz about "entrepreneurs and specialists."  (I did not find the link to exactly that text, but excerpts from it - by reference at the end) <br><br>  ‚ÄúA person who calls himself an expert is a staunch fanatic of consumption.‚Äù <br><br>  Let's jump a little more to the side, quite possibly you are using a Mac or Linux, like your operating system.  If so, close this article, but I said at the beginning that you are ready for life and there is nothing to read here.  So, if you now imagine that Mac and Linux users do not hear us, then imagine that you tell them that you are using XP.  A lot of criticism will come down on you, that this is ‚Äúsludge‚Äù, ‚Äúwrong‚Äù, etc.  Dear Mac users, is it the same?  Okay, we all know that you still will not close this article because I said so. <br><br>  But why do you, dear Macs and Linux users, think that I should delete my favorite OS just because you tell me so, if you can't even close the article (and this does not require you to relearn)?  Answer this question is not necessary. <br><br>  So, what is common in Mac users, in the DIV-ONLY-MODE typesetters, in Linuxsoids, in the followers of MVC frameworks (Ruby on Rails, Django, etc ...), Lexus specialists, and buyers? <br><br>  They are all looking for exclusivity.  No matter how much a Mac or iPhone is, they are told about them and if I buy it - I buy the right to brag about it, just like a new Lexus, using Ruby on Rails or if I have Linux on my desktop - I‚Äôm acquiring the right to become not like you.  Now I am "better" and you need to envy.  It doesn‚Äôt even matter whether it will simplify my life or that I will have to write more code, whether everything will be installed with one click or will need to deal with errors that another broader product could fix for me (Mac vs Linux desktop). <br><br>  Now I understand why they will insist that you use the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù things?  Exclusivity of their product.  Better or worse, another question. <br><br>  So, but what do they have in common with experts?  The specialist most often learned how to do something from another ‚Äúspecialist‚Äù, and the third one, etc.  The first is not a specialist, but a ‚Äúcreator‚Äù (the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãMoroz, we use his terminology) <br><br>  The creator knows exactly why he needs something. <br><br>  Who is the creator?  Steve Jobs, for example, knows exactly why he needs his products to be used, Ballmer, Torvalds, etc. <br><br>  But my main concern is not that someone uses something.  You want to typeset only DIVs - type up, just don't load me up with the fact that this is a semantic layout, because in return I will load you up with what my TABLE can be read by a person in a snowman costume.  Now the likelihood that your ‚Äúsemantic layout‚Äù is useful is approximately equal to the fact that a person in a snowman costume will read HTML.  Well, there are no "semantic" browsers, semantic spiders and the semantic network.  If you read the special HTML carefully, you may even find that this word was used there to explain that the HTML language with tags that can be embedded inside other tags, thereby marking the markup of the document.  Or you may not find it.  Not about this article. <br><br>  Now I‚Äôm still a little ponaezzha on CSS (although it could be a joke for TABLE just for fun, then I‚Äôll explain what this is all about)  You type only DIVs - please, this is correct, just as correct as typesetting with tables, javascript, or BLOCKQUOTS.  Are you separating the view from the data?  Then all your layout should be without tags.  Tag, this is, oh God, the idea!  Are you using a div (which indicates that it is a block of text) around the text?  This is a mixture of data and presentation!  How can you! <br><br>  Let's go back to the example with my site.  According to the results of the development of the site, I published a considerable number of articles in which I described the circumvention process ~ 100 mil.  sites from one server, database, structure, etc.  He wrote - for himself, so as not to forget and try again. <br><br>  Articles gained in popular social networks.  (see footnote [2] to understand why I do not publish what and what kind of project) And I received a lot of criticism.  At the same time, many criticisms were meaningless, ‚Äúhe could not use the hammer and he blamed the hammer for this,‚Äù although I wrote exactly the opposite - that I could not use the hammer and I need to use it somehow differently. <br><br>  It put me in a stupor.  Why do people write as if they did not read my article, but respond with cliches.  And suddenly I caught two articles on my eyes - literally the next day.  One of them is on Habr√© (lost link - put it on otpishite in kamentah) about the fact that people lost the ability to read thoughtfully and the second of Victor Dotsenko "The fifth rule of arithmetic or the radius of the Earth is 10 millimeters." <br><br>  In general, here something began to reach me.  The last article says that the French students thought that 3/6 is 1/3, as it turned out, because ‚Äúthey were taught that way‚Äù.  They did not think about the reasons or that this could be wrong - they just heard that this is the way they are repeated.  Students Dotsenko - these are the same specialists of Frost.  The education system contributes to learning, not thinking. <br><br>  Exactly the same specialists came to me with memorized phrases ‚Äúhammer does not work‚Äù, exactly the same people criticize TABLE designers, Windows users, or those who mix PHP and HTML in small projects.  Well, what for me in the project from 1 page do 1 view, 1 model, 1 template, 1 settings file, 1 css file, 1 javascript file, etc.? .. This question is also not necessary to answer. <br><br>  Once I was a mathematician and believed that everything can be understood by logic and words, then I realized that Eastern mystic with understanding through sensation is much closer to real science and their method of breaking stereotypes is a way to make a person think. <br><br>  So, is there any point in the layout only with CSS?  There is no!  And only tables?  There is no!  And mixed?  There is no!  And buy a Mac?  There is no!  Stay on Windows?  There is no! <br><br>  Does it make sense to me if I cannot explain why the method I use is good and why is it bad?  There is no point in me.  I am a specialist.  I am a product of mass education.  The mindless, slowly rotting mass.  We all die slowly. <br><br>  However, at that moment, when I finally think ‚ÄúWhy is layout only CSS better?  Why is she worse?  Does it work just for me?  What exactly is embedded in the meaning of the word 'semantic'?  What does this word mean in general? ‚Äù- here a meaning appears in my life (‚Äú semantics ‚Äù- a section of semiotics - the science of‚Äú meaning ‚Äù).  And even if you finally thought about the fact that ‚ÄúI make CSS to stand out from the crowd somehow‚Äù, there is more meaning in your life than in the lives of those who repeat the fiftieth time that ‚Äúyou need to separate data from ideas‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOnce I asked my spouse why she cuts a piece of meat with a square, cutting its edges, before putting it in a frying pan.  She said that her grandmother roasted meat.  I went to her to find out.  It turned out that my grandmother had a poor family and had no money for the dishes, she had a too small griddle to put all the meat on her and she cut off the edges.  We also had a large frying pan, but my wife continued to cut the meat, not knowing why? ‚Äù(The quote is inaccurate and incorrect, perhaps not from‚Äú Think and Rich ‚Äù) <br><br>  So if I repeat that it is necessary to separate the data from the representations, but I can not say what specific error in my life has made me now separate the data from the representations - there is no point in my life.  I do not think.  I repeat.  I cut the meat and throw out the pieces. <br><br>  Exactly from the same series google "monkeys, because here it is so accepted" - you will be very surprised if you have not read this before. <br><br>  Since up to this place no one will finish it up anyway, shall we play fate?  If this topic becomes popular, then at least one comment will be ‚Äúnonsense of a person who doesn‚Äôt know how to make CSS‚Äù, at least one will be in the spirit of ‚Äúpoppies cooler than Windows‚Äù, someone will say that I ‚Äúmade a mistake in some kind of quote "(Of course without noticing the forest for the trees - the meaning of the article for letters) and of course there will be the eternal" some loser is bored with life ":) <br><br>  So if you are constantly criticized that you are doing something ‚Äúwrong‚Äù, but your choice is not the result of chance, but a cruel mistake in the past or because you compared both ways in your experience and one of them - faster, causes less mistakes or more convenient for you - There is a sense in your life - you are one of those who think and will not write more code or less reliable code just because this language is ‚Äúnot cool‚Äù, this platform is ‚Äúnot youth‚Äù, but you come across ‚Äú specialists ‚Äùwhen you are told about‚Äú semantics ‚Äù(as you remember during the strike  about the word 'right' - it won the war and replace it, because it is much more strange word to many, but it is used "best experts" - who quickly starts to repeat all). <br><br>  Want to at least try to learn to think?  I will not teach this, I myself am not really taught.  Read the book ‚ÄúTruth in theses‚Äù (so that they do not consider that it is an advertisement - this book is in the internet for free, mine even came out free of charge). <br><br>  And most importantly, you can understand that there is almost no ‚Äúopinion‚Äù of anyone.  You have a truly ‚Äúown opinion‚Äù in only one of the billions of cases, maybe once in a lifetime. <br><br>  - 1. <a href="http://shsd.ru/biblioteka/article-moroz/podgotovitel-kurs-shsd/pk9/">shsd.ru/biblioteka/article-moroz/podgotovitel-kurs-shsd/pk9</a> <br>  Article about the specialist, Yuri Moroz <br><br>  2. I do not publish what this project is and the network, because the article does not relate to this, and if you publish it, you will be distracted and you will not understand what all this is for.  You even now have forgotten that one paragraph ago I suggested you to read a book :) <br><br>  And if you really thought about what I said - think about the main question: ‚ÄúWhy should we think about why I am doing something?‚Äù <br><br><img src="http://habrahabr.ru/media/userpic/avatar/14/45/58/31055.png"><br>  Yoi Haji <br>  <a href="http://yoihj.habrahabr.ru/blog/">view from Habra</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30187/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30187/</a></p>
