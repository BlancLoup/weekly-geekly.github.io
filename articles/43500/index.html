        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
      Of course, the most troubles were with the graphics, some background pictures had to be redrawn.  Not everything could be done as we would like, since there was no ‚Äúgood‚Äù command for serious processing of templates and background pictures of the site. <br><br>  So, after optimization, the counter began to write to the new log, and it became possible to compare what was ‚Äúbefore‚Äù and ‚Äúafter‚Äù.  First of all, I was interested in the percentage of views that were ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù in 2 and 4 seconds, and separately, for visiting the site for the first time, and for viewing subsequent pages. <br><br>  First pages: before optimization in 2s.  30% met, after - 50%.  In 4c.  57% and 65% respectively. <br>  Repeated views: Two seconds: up to - 58%, after - 80%.  4 seconds: before - 79%, after - 88%. <br><br>  And now the fun part.  If you take the number of received orders (including phone calls) and calculate the return on the site, taking into account the difference in attendance, we get an increase of at least 10%. <br><br>  Yes, it was not the revenue itself that was taken into account, but calls and attempts to make an order.  Financial returns depend too much on the quality of the work of managers, so that the difference can be estimated ‚Äúin rubles‚Äù. <br><br>  In general, we have already accumulated some pretty interesting statistics, I will analyze it a bit later and post it either as a separate post or here. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/43500/">https://habr.com/ru/post/43500/</a></p>
