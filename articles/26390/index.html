  <section class="page js-page"><h1>You you you We? (I'm a little crazy)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Appealing “you” (if there is an alternative “you”) is not only an underlined respect.  It is also an underlined distance between people.  And since the respect of one person to another usually acts by default and with rare and obvious exceptions does not raise doubts, the “you” is in fact not a respectful form, but a form of distancing and partly disregard, which in some cases can have the opposite effect (aha, and -10 to persuasion). <br><br>  At first I had the idea to propose to introduce a new word into use (“twa / tvas / tvam”, for example), for use as a respectful but not distancing treatment in cases when there are doubts about the correctness of the choice between “you” and “you ".  But in that case, turning to “you” would be a form of disrespectful treatment and would quickly become obsolete, returning everything to its fullest extent.  Therefore, I <strong>conclude as follows: in all cases where the emphasis on the distance between the interlocutors is not required, boldly communicate to “you” and not to steam</strong> .  In Fido, by the way, this was the way it was, and did not cause any problems.  And where there is no respect, you can always have time to say “you fucking” ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  And how <em>are they</em> ? </h2>  In English, “you” originally meant not “you / you”, but an unambiguous “you”.  “You” in English sounded like “thou”, and is now considered familiarly dismissive (examples of reference to “thou” can be seen in the movie Clockwork Orange).  It was just once in England that they were forcibly banned (initially, this ban was introduced in the army, and then spread more widely) to contact any person with “you”, and since then they have not been soared. <br><br><h2>  About semantics and in general </h2>  In general, addressing one person in the plural is semantic nonsense.  Well, of course, if you don’t see in every person a person’s <s>array (a person person ’)</s> one-person community, which is even worse, because it has all the signs of shizo.

    <h2>  "We-with" and "we-without" </h2>  And even in the Great and Mighty, I am infuriated by the use of one word “we” for the cases of “we are with you” and “we are without you” <s>and a word denoting the reverse part of the tribe</s> .  I think it would be worth it for the sake of fun to try saying “cape” for the first case and “web” for the second: I wonder if the people are crooked or not ... :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26390/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26390/</a></p>
