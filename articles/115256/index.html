This product has been used for a long time.  And for many years, while the product exists, Kontur-Extern protects the important, secret and dangerous data of its customers from encroachment.  And they stand on guard, defending themselves against intruders with unique methods and encryption systems, promoting this brainchild through small firms.  So, one of the ‚Äúsmall firms‚Äù in the Trans-Baikal Territory is ‚ÄúAfina-Soft‚Äù, which connects products of the special design bureau ‚ÄúKontur‚Äù to itself.  Of course, as her big brother's younger sister, she provides all the means of protection and all the security guarantees, and clients can sleep well.  They are in good hands. <br><br>  And in fact?  Enchanting mess.  There are no other words for what is going on in Athena-Soft, at least in the part that deals with the Trans-Baikal Territory, with Chita.  Imagine the situation: in the accounting department, Kontur-Extern suddenly breaks down, for no reason at all.  And then the interesting begins.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Fell "Kontur-Extern"?  What to do, the situation is everyday, and before it happened.  We are trying to raise.  Shaman with some kind of internal storage - does not rise.  Shaman with certificates, it turns out that they only work in IE.  We put another IE, fresher, the result is the same.  Contact technical support.  They frustrate us with the fact that IE definitely needs the sixth version, so delete all your other browsers, step to the left, step to the right - death.  Removed.  Installed.  Does not work.  Technical support says: ok, we'll write you a letter now, there will be a file.  My colleague, who spoke with them, was waiting for a letter to his Google Mailbox.  There are no letters and no, although in technical support they say that they sent it.  He asks them what was in the letter.  ‚ÄúThere was an exe file in a zip archive.‚Äù  All clear.  Google eliminates such letters.  A colleague says to them: pack a file with a password, and pass the password in the letter, and Google will not know anything about the exe-file.  Technical support response: "For us, this is an unusual practice, we have never worked with archives, but we will try to archive it."  Hooray!  They will try!  And already the end of the working day, the accounting department revolts, my colleague from the company "Afina-Soft" and their product "in complete delight."  Waiting, waiting.  No letter.  We call, they say that they did not work, but now they will give us a login and password to the box on mail.ru (!), Where we have a letter.  Indeed, they sent a username and password from the mailbox to mail.ru.  A letter with a login and password got into GMail's spam box, because the ‚ÄúCompany News‚Äù sheet is attached to this short information, the text of which is based on the best spam patterns.  Anyway, we received the password and login (they coincided (!!)), we go into the box and see that besides us in the Trans-Baikal Territory there are still a dozen organizations that communicate with Athena-Soft in the same way.  (!!!) And for us there really is a letter!  Security, security, privacy!  The system "Kontur-Extern" guarantees. <br><br>  PS A colleague asked them not to send more company news in letters, because they themselves will be evil Pinocchio, if the letters through spam filters do not break through.  The answer was: ‚ÄúThe news at the end of the letter is very useful and interesting to many of our subscribers.  They do not contradict the specifics of our activities, they are not spam. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>UPDATE</b> <br>  Employees of "Athena-Soft" have shown themselves as people who accidentally fell into the sphere of IT, and moreover - to information security.  I express to them a deep "phi" for non-professionalism. <br>  Employees of SKB "Kontur" reacted very quickly and accurately, for which many thanks to them! <br><br>  Significant <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_angry/115256/">comment</a> : <br><br>  ‚ÄúMy name is Igor Goldberg. I manage the project‚Äú Kontur-Extern ‚Äù. <br><br>  I would not like to write a lot of letters, so I will try to say very briefly and about the most important thing: <br><br>  1. Thanks for the feedback.  The situation with Athena-Soft is really outrageous (I know that the situation has a sequel, which we should not be proud of either).  We will take action.  I apologize to you from myself and the company for this disgrace. <br><br>  2. We would like to understand a little more detail about the problem you are writing about.  If it doesn‚Äôt make it difficult, write to me in a few words what exactly didn‚Äôt work for you (if you know the number of your application registered in our system of accounting for requests, please write it too).  There, in a personal, write me the name of the box on the mail;) If you have any current unresolved problems - let me know about them. <br><br>  3. Restrictions with IE are not very simple, but surmountable, we are doing it.  Maybe it does not work as quickly as we would like, but nonetheless. " <br><br>  My <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_angry/115256/">answer</a> : <br><br>  ‚ÄúI am very glad that your company behaves like an adult.  Thank you on behalf of our little telecom organization :) <br><br>  By the way, we somewhat doubted the correctness of our actions, and even now we doubt it.  If we somehow harmed those who did not deserve it in your company, I apologize the same way.  This does not apply to Athens-Soft, since its employees, with whom we had to communicate, simply amuse us with their unprofessionalism.  (Example: ‚ÄúWhy did you publish an article on Google ?!‚Äù) <br><br>  I suppose my partner, who has encountered a problem, will be able to describe the situation better.  I will give him your message.  If you have a bug tracking system, we will definitely find it and use it if necessary.  According to his stories, I realized that I managed to do something after some additional shamanism (already after a showdown with Athena-Soft).  I think the partner will let you know about the problems, or we will let you know that we are fine. <br><br>  About IE - yes, it's like a splinter.  I think everyone understands that it is already rotting. <br><br>  In any case, I wish you success and prosperity.
