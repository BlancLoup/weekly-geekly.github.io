  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A little about our blog. And interesting research</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For starters, just a couple of words about what Mediagates is.  The main task of Mediagates is to enable professionals or beginners in the field of music to earn money from their talent or simply professional competence.  Secondary tasks: uniting all the pros on the same platform, which will allow people interested to easily find each other, as well as finding new faces for the Russian and not only the stage. <br><br>  I will definitely write more about the project itself when we launch the beta version, and this will most likely be in the middle of May.  I will talk about the process of creation, the possibilities of the project, as well as the nearest plans for the development of the project. <br><br>  Now I would like to briefly tell you what to expect from the blog of our company and go directly to the essence of the post itself. <br><ol><li>  Naturally, the update information on the development of the project, statistical indicators. </li><li>  Appeal for advice to you, HabraUzery.  Perhaps you dissuade us from some obviously erroneous moves.  Or vice versa, instill confidence that we are moving in the right direction. </li><li>  We plan to publish any interesting research on the music industry on the Internet and reviews of new services that we find interesting for some reason or another.  So, if you are a music lover, do not forget to look at our page. </li></ol><br>  And now, just one such study, which our editors accidentally stumbled upon.  It turns out ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  It is the format of digital music, for which music lovers are more willing to pay money ... they, in fact, use the least. <br></h4><br>  This is exactly what Nielsen claims, which polled 26,644 users from 53 countries.  And here are some statistics:

This means that, although the iTunes Store is the most important partner of recording studios, services like YouTube and Vevo are gaining more and more consumers due to the fact that they are able to watch music videos, and the record companies get their due fee. <br><br>  It is also interesting that people are willing to pay for the services of viewing music videos.  In the table, video services are in second place after downloading. <br><br>  Who is interested, can get acquainted with the <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/reports-downloads/2011/hyper-fragmented-world-of-music.html">full report</a> (in English and requires registration).  Well, I do not know how much this applies to Russia, yet we have a peculiar mentality and, in terms of music consumption, we can only compare it with Spanish.  But the trends themselves, to me personally, as the leader of a project dedicated to music, seemed quite interesting. <br><br>  Therefore, I want to ask you,% username%, for which music content or service are you willing to pay?  And what money?  Interested in opinion, as people involved in music, and just listeners. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117821/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117821/</a></p>
