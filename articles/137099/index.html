  <section class="page js-page"><h1>First look at the Sony Xperia S: the smartphone of our time</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Less than two weeks from the announcement, as I finally got a new flagship of Sony Ericsson - <b>Sony Xperia S.</b>  I took my Xperia arc, the 2011 Sony Ericsson flagship, to the first meeting with him.  Xperia S is the direct heir to the ‚Äúarch‚Äù, so the comparison is more than appropriate: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/087/e1b/a3d/087e1ba3d51f9ef8650da375c555bd43.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The preview was organized in the new Sony Ericsson office in Moscow City, where the Russian branch of the company moved in the fall.  I like their view from the window:

At the bottom of the phone below it is the antenna of the device.  And the touch buttons are above, their location is indicated on the body by barely noticeable dots: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ceb/9ad/e98/ceb9ade984be260fb4091705a87615d8.jpg"><br><br>  The screen of the Xperia S increased slightly - 4.3 inch Reality Display versus 4.2 of the Xperia arc.  The screen resolution has increased much more significantly, now the corresponding HD 720p format - 1280x720 pixels, guaranteeing an ultra-clear image - it's impossible to find grain on a 4-inch screen with a laptop resolution.  For the quality of the image is responsible already familiar technology Mobile BRAVIA Engine. <br><br>  The software on this copy of Xperia S is not yet final, so there will not be any screenshots and sample photos yet.  And yet, he will enter the market under the Sony brand.  In the meantime, this unit is not for sale: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b1f/d0b/9a5/b1fd0b9a54e521653744593f24ca19a2.jpg"><br><br>  The back cover no longer needs to be otkaryabivat nails - it moves one finger up, then quietly removed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ccf/584/f6e/ccf584f6e4a86f240d0b048a6ade2754.jpg"><br><br>  The geometric design is not an optical illusion, the Xperia S ribs and the truth are flat - on two of the four sides, where there are no protruding buttons, it can stand perfectly at ease.  Probably, in this you can even find some practical use - for example, put it on the table and watch cartoons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/be2/575/8ed/be25758edbe646d23f55e2224111d45b.jpg"><br><br>  However, the device is not flat in profile - unlike the Xperia arc, the Xperia S has a curved lid, but the goal is the same - so that the device fits comfortably in the palm of your hand: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/586/5e2/e27/5865e2e27a678de0f00469a4e2c3c026.jpg"><br><br>  Above there is only a screen lock button, it‚Äôs the power button and a 3.5-mm headphone jack in a stylish metal bezel: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d60/679/61e/d6067961e521c2819e5d2386cd0cfe8d.jpg"><br><br>  The remaining buttons - volume and camera adjustment - traditionally on the right "side" of the device.  There is also an HDMI connector.  By the way, I did not miss the opportunity to check live Xperia S killer feature - launching the camera in 1.5 seconds, even from the locked state: it works!  Even despite the pre-final software: you take the device in your hand, you press the button on the end, the screen turns on once, you take a picture at the expense of two.  While you were reading this sentence, I would have already managed to take a picture of you.  At the same time, the camera is equipped with the already known technology Exmor R, which allows, thanks to a special device of the matrix, to shoot in the dark with less noise. <br><br>  To control the player, unlocking is now also not required - the pause and rewind buttons are now displayed on the lock screen: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/142/d3c/d90/142d3cd904825fcb56d99d75d3ca7fc3.jpg"><br><br>  When the back cover is removed, significant differences in the Xperia S layout are visible: the battery is now non-removable, there are no memory card slots - all phones will come with 32 GB of built-in flash memory, and the micro SIM will take the place of a regular SIM card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b95/515/935/b955159355449abac6b19177e5642c12.jpg"><br><br>  The general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãchanges is clear - in order to cram more features into the same dimensions, you have to play with the layout of the elements, so avoiding the need to provide easy user access to memory and battery and reducing the SIM card slot simplifies the design.  The benefit for the consumer is also clear - no need to spend money on the purchase of a separate enlarged memory card, and new features - for example, the built-in NFC support in the same dimensions - is also nice.  However, the possibility of hot-swappable SIM-cards is deceptive - you still have to restart the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b96/5b7/205/b965b720538357347208482333c10aad.jpg"><br><br>  I also recall that the volume of the built-in battery is now increased to 1,750 mAh compared to 1500 mAh Xperia arc.  The device will go on sale in the first quarter of this year. <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  Looking at the Xperia S, I wondered where the mobile industry would go next.  Judge for yourself: this camera is equipped with a 12 MP camera, a 4.3 "screen with a resolution of 1280x720, a 1.5 GHz dual-core processor, <br>  NFC support and a 1.3 MP front-facing camera ‚Äî everything that the Xperia arc could miss compared to competitors or other Sony Ericsson models, is now in Xperia S.  And some parameters have nowhere to increase - it makes no sense to increase the screen resolution or the number of megapixels in the camera.  You can, of course, infinitely increase the power and performance of processors, but so far not all applications are able to use the capabilities of even two cores.  Sony Xperia S caught up with its time and stopped to wait until the time will give something new. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137099/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137099/</a></p>
