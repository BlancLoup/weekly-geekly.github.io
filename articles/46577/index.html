  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The choice of design tool (UML)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A few months ago I was assigned to choose a tool for designing and documenting systems.  In the company where I work, all this was done in Word and other office programs, and the products that the company produces became more and more complex, more and more people participated in the development, and so on.  Therefore, it became necessary to use some more suitable tool for the work of analysts, designers and developers.  I will share the findings. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After a brief acquaintance with such tools, 5 were highlighted, which were evaluated in more detail.  When evaluating, my colleague and I identified about 30 criteria for objectivity of the assessment.  We have grouped these criteria as follows: <br>  - <b>System design</b> - does the tool provide enough functionality for documentation of requirements, us-cases, OO design and other UML diagrams.  Does it have the functionality to create dependencies between objects of different types, the ability to track changes.  This is a mandatory criterion for the tool. <br>  - <b>Export</b> - the tool should support convenient export of artifacts produced in it.  Different export formats should be available - at least html and doc.  Document templates should be easily modified.  This is also a mandatory criterion. <br>  - <b>Convenience of use.</b>  The tool should be convenient, intuitive, with a simple interface for frequently used functions. <br>  - <b>Minimize routine</b> .  It would be nice if the tool did some things on its own - for example, it generated test cases, object design from a database, maybe pieces of code. <br><br>  So, 5 tools and their evaluation. <br>  1. <b><a href="http://www.casecomplete.com/">Case Complete</a></b> - a tool for recording requirements, creating us-cases and connections between them.  Convenient interface, export, but one serious drawback - this thing doesn‚Äôt go further than us-cases.  In general, it is not clear how she got on our list.  2 of 5. <br>  2. <b><a href="http://www.visualcase.com/">Artiso Visual Case</a></b> - the first thing that catches your eye when using this tool is a wildly awkward user interface.  To create an elementary class, it took me 5 minutes.  In addition, the tool does not have the ability to link objects (like a us-case &lt;-&gt; class), etc. 1 of 5. <br>  3. <b><a href="http://www.nomagic.com/text.php%3Flang%3D2%26item%3D232%26arg%3D206">Magic Draw</a></b> - the tool has a very strong side for UML, but this makes it a bit uncomfortable.  Also, there is no connection between different objects (like a class and activity, etc.).  3 out of 5. <br>  4. <b><a href="http://www.sparxsystems.com.au/products/ea/">Sparx Enterprise Architect</a></b> - meets almost all the criteria put forward, just that some frequently used functions are hidden somewhere.  Probably, if you get used to - well.  Also, I didn‚Äôt find in it how to connect requirements with design objects.  Maybe she was looking bad.  4 out of 5. <br>  5. <b><a href="http://www.sybase.com/products/modelingdevelopment/powerdesigner">Sybase PowerDesigner</a></b> - the first impression after opening the program is a completely different level.  All functions are exactly where you expect to find them, and this tool has satisfied all 30 criteria from the groups described.  In addition, PowerDesigner has a bunch of very useful features that are not included in the list of criteria - such as change assessment (impact), model validation, Repository, and more.  5 out of 5. <br><br>  Here I posted a complete comparison, if anyone is interested.

      Although PowerDesigner is several times more expensive than others, we chose it.  Today, I use it for 2 months - if anyone is interested, I can write about it - not everything in it is perfect (but close!). <br><br>  Probably just ask why the list did not include Rational Rose.  I do not like him!  He's not handsome.  And yet, I could not find where to download it legally.  But basically he is good.  But PowerDesigner is better. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46577/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46577/</a></p>
