  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Throw me a link to the tablet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I enjoy reading. <br><br>  Yes, I'll start exactly like this: "I love reading."  It is pleasant for me to lie down and read before bedtime, the body slows down the processes, the experience experienced during the day is formalized and fit into understandable and simple forms, and new knowledge from the reading sometimes just spurs the imagination to thinking, and sometimes leads to completely unexpected decisions. <br><br>  Everything was simple, as long as there was an ordinary paper book, but I started reading from the tablet.  And often he continued to read what he started reading on the computer.  And here I ran into the problem of transferring a link from one device to another.  How did you manage to solve such a small, but intractable task - see for yourself. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first, the most obvious way, to have two accounts in Skype or another IM and link links.  But I have one account on different devices for easy response, whether I am in front of a computer or on the road.  The problem of link transmission is easily solved, but the number of links becomes unimaginable with time, and it is extremely inconvenient to make signatures to each.  Therefore, this option was rejected. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The second option was to create a separate file on the home file storage, where notes will be made to the links.  On the one hand, it is possible to organize access even from the outside, but to search for the necessary link, you need to connect remotely, find the file, then look for the link in the file.  The option was rejected as inconvenient. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f7c/648/0a0/f7c6480a0318472da8e91804aaacd4a9.jpg"><br><br>  The third option - Opera Links.  If you use the Opera browser at work, at home, laptop, tablet and lots of other devices, then this is extremely convenient.  It is enough to enable this feature and synchronization will be performed automatically, if you close the browser on the device where the new link was added.  This is perhaps one of the most convenient ways that I have been using for the last 3-4 years, because I often have to work on different computers, and the collection of links has long exceeded 3 hundred.  Everything is good, but this function will not work if the browser is turned on or the application has been terminated with an error.  Yes, and synchronization requires a certain time.  I wanted something so that in one motion it was possible to transfer the necessary link to the tablet, and with a description.  And the answer was found - Message Beam for Android. <br><br>  The application is placed <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/message-beam-for-android/mlndbhjjfllliigpnpinfhmiaocogeba">in the Google Chrome browser plugin</a> .  The installation takes a couple of minutes and ends with the appearance of the icon next to the address bar.  The next step is to connect multiple mobile devices.  It turned out to be difficult to find the application in the Play Market, but the Message Beam application itself solved the problem - when registering, a window pops up with a QR code, which you can immediately go on to downloading apk for your device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/949/254/37f/94925437f7a04f83a4a883e6e57cf0e2.JPG"><br><br>  The installation process is simple to ugliness, and the result is to enter a simple registration password from the tablet in the Chrome window on your computer.  So you can bind multiple devices and address to send links.  The list of attached devices looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e9b/06d/8ea/e9b06d8eac434ca1910e9c22d321eda6.JPG"><br><br>  And now you can send links with a brief description and a title from the computer to the tablet: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c3/d28/0d3/9c3d280d3bd1414aa6118e5b9c19f24c.JPG"><br><br>  And so it looks on the tablet screen: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/232/d4f/773/232d4f77324f4ac4a72247e61eb824fb.png"><br><br>  The problem of quick transfer of links was solved, and the rest of the evening was spent reading interesting articles.  In one evening, I tried four options for working with links between two devices and the latter turned out to be the most convenient when they should not be stored, classified and put off for a long time. <br><br>  If you know faster, comfortable and logical ways to store links - share with me and readers in the comments. <br><br>  Do not forget that we have always been considered the most reading nation.  Read with pleasure! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d0/12c/f76/6d012cf76fa84ea9b48abb829c455110.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365253/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365253/</a></p>
