Postmortem</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/b8/0a/b80a0f7420ee0c2324d8eb15f8fd5843.jpg" alt="Monument" align="left">  Recently, my strictly comrade, laptop Lenovo z61m burned down monitor.  Upon reflection, I realized that it would be long and expensive to repair it and bought a new laptop.  The old laptop decided to adapt to the home media center, since the screen is not needed there, and everything else worked fine. <br><br>  So, initially I had a Lenovo z61m laptop running Windows 7 Ultimate, a Phillips CRT TV and a desire to make it convenient.  As it turned out later, the first two components were not entirely suitable, but more on that later.  I started by choosing the program that will turn the content, since it did not require investments.  I tried Microsoft Media Center (MMC) and <a href="http://xbmc.org/">XBMC</a> . <br><br>  MMC beautifully showed covers for music files, thumbnails for video files and played any content just like I used to in Microsoft Media Player and Media Player Classic - Home Cinema.  Bribed also that it was planned to buy the maykrosoftovsky remote control, so, most likely, compatibility problems will be a minimum.

      XBMC liked the fact that it has a large number of skins (skins), and the default skin in black initially liked more than the blue background of MMC.  The abundance of settings in XBMC, plug-ins, relatively frequent updates, and the built-in plugin to display the weather also added interest to this program. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  At this stage, I thought that I had at least two options for software, and took up iron.  The laptop has an infrared port, and the thought arose of trying to use it and the remote from a TV or an old DVD player.  I reread a large number of instructions on various websites, tried to install various programs such as <a href="http://winlirc.sourceforge.net/">WinLirc</a> in order to be able to use the console in Windows.  Nothing worked.  The software did not work hard, editing the registry in Windows, changing drivers, BIOS settings in a laptop - nothing helped.  Spending about a day on unsuccessful attempts, I came to the conclusion that such a scheme (built-in IR receiver and an arbitrary remote control) would not work, since the receiver and the console most likely have different frequency ranges.  About the possibility of such problems on the forums warned, by the way.  It was decided to spend about 600 rubles on the purchase of a specially designed console. <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/b1/ea/b1ea84214a4fee0713be57ee3465fdba.jpg" alt="Remote" align="left"></a>  :-) <br><br>  First of all, I went to the Omsk Knicks, as there had been such consoles before.  When I arrived, it turned out that all the consoles had been sold, and no new delivery is planned.  Apparently, slow-moving goods.  After that, I went to ‚ÄúWhist‚Äù, where I was told that they did not have remotes, and there was not and would not be in ‚ÄúDNS‚Äù with the same success.  Almost in desperation, I went to "Rhythm" - hurray, there is!  The price was about 360 rubles (I do not remember exactly).  Remote - some noname (clickable image). <br><br>  A couple of days later, a friend told me that he went to Rhythm and was told there that they didn‚Äôt have remotes, never had one, but he bought a remote control for about 900 rubles at DNS.  So trust the sales consultants after that, when they say one thing, then the other. <br><br>  I stuck the remote receiver into the laptop and, as the seller promised, it all worked right away.  No drivers, no programs.  Launched Microsoft Media Center - everything works, everything scrolls.  Hooray?  Nothing like this.  :-( The range of the remote turned out to be slightly lower than that of a conventional television. And most importantly: there are unnecessary buttons on the remote: <br><ul><li>  Close - acts as ALT-F4, that is, closes the player </li><li>  Power - turns off the laptop, after which I could not turn it on with the remote </li><li>  Desktop - acts as WIN-D, that is, shows the desktop </li><li>  Media Center - Launches Microsoft Media Center </li></ul><br><br>  While I tried the remote, I myself repeatedly pressed the Desktop and Media Center buttons, which means that other family members will also press them and find themselves in the situation ‚Äúeverything is gone, you have to call your dad to repair‚Äù.  The Power button in the presence of a small child is a guarantee that you will constantly get a laptop and take it out of sleep mode by pressing the button inside.  The meaning of the remote is lost.  The Close button is also completely superfluous for my purposes.  Media Center button launches Microsoft Media Center and only that!  If you use an alternative program, you understand. <br><br>  All my attempts to reconfigure the buttons of the remote or block some of the buttons were unsuccessful.  I tried to change the keys in the registry, install programs for reassigning buttons, install alternative drivers - all to no purpose.  How it works out of the box, and it works.  Nothing can be changed.  True, I found a couple of alternative solutions: <br><ul><li>  disabled in the settings of Windows falling asleep computer by pressing the Power button </li><li>  explained family members what to do if they clicked the Desktop button (click again) </li><li>  explained what to do if you clicked Close (use the arrows to select the program‚Äôs shortcut and start it again) </li><li>  removed the Microsoft Media Center component from Windows (by that time I decided not to use it) </li></ul><br>  The result was a conditionally acceptable functional remote. <br><br>  We return to the choice of software.  I dismissed Microsoft Media Center for the following reasons: <br><ul><li>  starts slowly and runs slowly </li><li>  after displaying the video file, it shows the summary window (I don‚Äôt remember how it is called in Russian), in which you can delete the file, write it to disk, etc.  Judging by the forums on the Internet (the <a href="http://thegreenbutton.com/">The Green Button</a> forum is very good), this window does not turn off.  For me personally, its presence is already a big inconvenience, and the possibility to do something with the file is even more so.  I remind you that there is a small child in the house. </li><li>  overall interface complexity (subjectively) </li></ul><br><br>  I don‚Äôt know how good MMC is with plugins, but I suspect it‚Äôs as good as XBMC, for example. <br><br>  After that, I tried <a href="http://www.team-mediaportal.com/">Media Portal</a> .  But somehow I didn‚Äôt like him right away, it seemed that he was worse off than MMC and XBMC. <br><br>  Decided to configure and use XBMC.  In general, everything turned out, but there are drawbacks: <br><ul><li>  Some video files are played with "stuttering" </li><li>  Can not play video files in a row.  That is, if you start a cartoon, after it ends, the next cartoon in the list will not start playing.  Judging by the XBMC forum, this opportunity has been asked for for more than 5 years, but the developers do not want to do it.  They offer either click play on the folder (then all the cartoons in the folder will play in a row) or create playlists.  Developers believe that this is enough.  All attempts by people to explain what they are not satisfied with such decisions are broken against a wall of misunderstanding. </li><li>  The interface has extra details that I could not remove.  For example, if the files are on an external disk, then you must first select the disk, then the folder on the disk and then the file.  Why choose a disk if I specified the placement of video files separately - it is not clear to me.  It is also possible to climb where it is not necessary, for example, to search for a file by name (then it is not clear how to get out of this mode using the remote control) </li><li>  It was not possible to prohibit the switching of file display modes (list, thumbnails, etc.) </li><li>  It was not possible to configure the automatic retrieval of information about the series.  Apparently, it was necessary to somehow arrange the files in a special way - I could not figure it out.  Information about the series, by the way, is only in English, although this is not the fault of the program, of course. </li><li>  A plugin that receives information about movies with <a href="http://www.kinopoisk.ru/">kinopoisk.ru</a> does not always work correctly.  For example, for the trilogy about Colonel Zorin, he chose the ‚ÄúGodfather‚Äù with Al Pacino as a coincidence. </li></ul><br><br>  After such a relative success with XBMC, I decided to also try <a href="http://www.boxee.tv/">Boxee</a> .  Overall, Boxee is good.  The interface is a little more thoughtful and, subjectively, navigation is made a little more logical.  But the obvious bias towards online video, etc.  things that I did not plan to use completely leveled the joy of the interface and navigation.  I am back to XBMC. <br><br>  I decided that was enough, it's time to start everything in operation.  I connected everything to the TV and ... was horrified.  On the computer, everything looked good, but on a low resolution TV, the fonts are small (you can enlarge it if you edit the configs), the image does not fit in width (16: 9 in a laptop and 4: 3 in a TV), and even diagonal stripes run along the screen.  With the permission it was possible to try to figure it out, but I postponed it and engaged in pickups.  Since I connected the laptop to the TV using the old S-Video cable -&gt; Tulip, I decided to buy a new S-Video cable -&gt; S-Video.  Bought, did not help.  It turned out that the problem was not in the cable, but in the fact that the power supply unit of the laptop gave pickups.  If the power supply was disconnected and the laptop was running on battery, then there was no interference.  And why did I not notice this right away? <br><br>  Since the power supply costs about 2,000-2,500,000, I decided that it was not enough to change its meaning, and that was the end of my experiment with a home theater.  I returned to the old BBK DVD-player, which is connected to an external drive via USB.  I do not leave hopes for a second attempt after changing the TV. <br><br>  Findings: <br><ul><li>  Without HD-ready or FullHD TV you should not start. </li><li>  If you started, then check that there is no interference from the power supply.  For LCD and plasma TVs this is not true, as I understand it. </li><li> The remote control must be chosen very carefully.  It is necessary to look at the set of buttons and their relative position.  Sometimes the buttons are strange sizes or strangely located.  For example, on the console that I bought, the rewind buttons are inconveniently located in relation to the play button (they must be in the same row), but the skip buttons must be higher in the same row as the stop button. </li><li>  Any software to some extent has drawbacks.  You will have to choose what is more important for you and what is less, since in most cases it will not work to adjust / change everything. </li></ul><br><br>  Bonus: <br>  If you are not too picky about the type of software, are ready to put up with some flaws, or you don‚Äôt have an old laptop with a burned screen :-), then I advise you also to look at the ready-made software-hardware solutions.  After reading the reviews and watching the video, the following options seemed interesting to me (didn‚Äôt use anything): <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.wdc.com/ru/products/products.asp%3Fdriveid%3D735">WD TV Live</a> <br>  It looks beautiful in appearance, looks nice shell.  In the reviews I read censures that I am not entirely omnivorous. <br>  Worth in Omsk DNS at the time of writing 3,850 rubles <br></li><li>  <a href="http://www.ixbt.com/multimedia/asus-hdp-r1.shtml">ASUS O! Play HDP-R1</a> or <a href="http://www.3dnews.ru/digital/asus_oplay_hdpr3/">ASUS O! Play Air HDP-R3</a> <br>  Looks pretty nice in appearance.  According to reviews, the most omnivorous.  If there is no need for wireless functions or support for memory cards, then you can take the younger model. <br>  Stands in Omsk DNS at the time of writing 3,790 for HDP-R1 / 5 750 rubles for HDP-R3 <br></li><li>  <a href="http://www.boxee.tv/box">D-Link Boxee Box</a> <br>  Funny appearance, the remote with the keyboard (it is not clear whether it will be Russified), Boxee as a shell. <br>  At the moment, only pre-order is available on Amazon for $ 199. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/106639/">https://habr.com/ru/post/106639/</a></p>
