  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Digital transformation of advertising in online retail. In the footsteps of "Video Analytics in Retail"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Advertising is the engine of commerce and it's hard to argue with that!  With advertising begins the promotion of any product or service on the market.  But this ‚Äúengine‚Äù is outdated, inefficient and noisy.  According to a <a href="http://www.akarussia.ru/knowledge/market_size/id8690">study by the</a> Association of Communication Agencies of Russia - 47% of the Russian advertising market in 2018 still accounted for the media (television, radio, press).  This means that the ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù tool of modern advertisers is ‚Äúcarpet bombing‚Äù by advertising to potential consumers, which even approximately does not show the number of ‚Äúwounded‚Äù and ‚Äúkilled‚Äù.  In simple terms, media is a tool that is not targeted and does not measure conversion. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Modern advertising has become an annoying factor for the consumer.  It is not tactful - it prevents us from watching our favorite programs, reading news, surfing the Internet, listening to music.  Advertising is not appropriate - trying to amuse us, when we are sad, to sell what is not needed, intimidates and enrages.  And this is true not only for classical mass media, but also for online advertising. <br><br>  The effectiveness of advertising is a matter of growing importance for the business, which is probably why in 2018 the volume of the Russian Internet advertising market showed a record growth of 22% and amounted to 43% of the total market volume (Source - <a href="http://www.akarussia.ru/knowledge/market_size/id8690">research</a> The volume of advertising in the media in 2018, the Association Communication Agencies of Russia).  The effectiveness of online advertising, read conversion - a well-defined indicator with clear calculation algorithms, but this is true only for e-commerce.  In addition, Internet advertising has flexible tools for targeting and centralized management of marketing companies in different contextual advertising systems.  But with all these advantages, contextual Internet advertising is just as annoying ‚Äî it is intrusive, often not relevant and creates the feeling of an observing ‚Äúbig brother.‚Äù  And it still does not have effective tools for evaluating conversion for offline businesses.  In the harsh conditions of cutting operating costs, increasing the effectiveness of advertising for offline trading is an open question.  This market is ripe for breakthrough innovative solutions.  One of the innovative views on this topic at the conference ‚ÄúVideo Analytics in Retail‚Äù was presented by Addreality. <br><br>  Advertising a new generation should take into account not only the needs of the buyer, but also his emotional state, financial capabilities, gender and age, motivation at a particular moment and, most importantly, to be relevant.  Addreality solutions are the omni-channel assistant of the buyer in the matter of optimizing his financial expenses for the satisfaction of vital needs.  From this point of view it is difficult to find a place better for advertising - than the store itself.  The buyer who came to the store has absolutely clear motivation to choose and / or purchase the necessary goods.

      For effective advertising it is necessary to understand that in modern consumer society - we do not just buy things, we get the pleasure of choice and subsequent possession or use.  This is true for buyers of all economic orbits, since  The act of buying is the act of exchanging the life time spent on earning income on the desired goods through money.  Regardless of the level of wealth, no one wants to sell a bargain in this exchange.  Effective advertising in a store should not be just a tool for motivating to buy - the motivation is already there - advertising should be a tool for guiding the buyer to the correct solution of the problem of exchanging his time, expressed in monetary terms, for goods or services.  Exchange beneficial to both parties. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bm/aq/7w/bmaq7wheih_qvrdyqij8wxkdoi8.jpeg"><br>  <i>Figure 1: Omnichannel communications with a customer in a store</i> <br><br>  To solve this problem, innovative advertising strategies should be comprehensive and use the most comfortable communication channels for the customer at any given time. <br><br>  <b>Sound design and audio advertising</b> <br>  Audiovisual design of the store not only creates an atmosphere of the brand, but also allows you to run targeted audio ads depending on external conditions, for example, the balance in the warehouse or the percentage of loyal visitors, which has a positive effect on the average bill. <br><br>  <b>Interactive advertising and information screens</b> <br><br>  Allows you to automate up-sell and cross-sell at the checkout and on the trading floor through personalized offers that take into account the shopping cart and purchase history.  Allow you to engage visitors in self-study of goods through interactive technologies, lift &amp; learn, targeting, recommendations of related products.  This communication channel is two-way, which provides the buyer with a simple way to assess the quality of service (linked to the employee, time and current action / check). <br><br>  When installed in the field of product promotions, interactive screens allow you to display targeted real-time advertising content by evaluating, for example, the sex or age of the person looking or based on triggers (face detection, motion detection, occurrence of a specific date, time, weather outside, scanning barcode or lifting goods from the shelf). <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uruoCtOQ1Dg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Video # 1: Addreality Face's unique face recognition technology</i> <br><br>  <b>Smart price-checkers and shelf-displays</b> <br><br>  They allow to improve the quality of service at the expense of additional features: control of the availability of goods and price tags, the ability to call a consultant, collection of statistics on scanned goods and applications.  In addition, they allow to evaluate the audience at the expense of WiFi traffic analysis and face recognition modules and to collect statistics of views, attention of the audience, conversion into views, determination of gender and age of the audience. <br><br>  <b>LED showcases, columns and media facades</b> <br><br>  I allow you to create a WOW effect and actively attract visitors by analyzing the subsequent conversion of advertising content on media facades. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iZvY2iQ4LmY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Video ‚Ññ2: LED showcases, columns and media facades - iQOS</i> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WMODgcrMafU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Video ‚Ññ3: LED showcases, columns and media facades - Riv Gauche</i> <br><br>  A special place among the means of communication with the buyer is occupied by the technology of visual targeting.  Do you know that, according to Oracle, 86% of customers are willing to pay more for better service?  That is why, according to Gartner, worldwide, 50% of B2C investment projects in 2017 were aimed at developing customer experience.  According to Dimension Data IT integrator, 80% of existing customer loyalty assessment systems do not meet the requirements of companies.  (source - <a href="https://softline.ru/about/blog/neyroset-na-sluzhbe-klientskogo-servisa">Neural network in the service of customer service</a> ).  That is why it is always important to have the tools to assess a person‚Äôs needs, his emotional state, financial capabilities, preferences and, most importantly, overall satisfaction with your service.  All this is made possible by video analytics technology that can recognize our emotions, see our interest or disgust, evaluate our appearance and even take into account current weather conditions.  All this allows conclusions to be drawn about the advertising offer required here and now for a particular visitor, his perception of the offer and the total satisfaction from your store. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bh/t9/el/bht9elalzehhwioif7aktv6brbs.jpeg"><br>  <i>Figure 2: Impersonal recognition of the buyer</i> <br><br>  Possessing the power of omni-channel communication with a customer, one needs to remember about the existence of an information gap between the marketing team and field staff, especially when it comes to retail chains.  Recall how often you had to find out about a particular campaign from advertising sources, but when you came to the store, you found that employees do not know anything about this promotional activity.  Remember the " <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/455878/">Promise and do</a> "?  Whatever happens in your store, you need to have the tools to quickly and efficiently inform employees about new marketing campaigns, such as mobile apps and / or corporate television. <br><br>  Transforming the store's advertising tools to the modern level, you get the opportunity to implement complex marketing strategies not only your own for your retail network, but also together with your partners, selling them "airtime" and providing unprecedented tools for two-way communication with the buyer.  At the same time, the sale of impressions is carried out in accordance with the practices of contextual online advertising aggregators, which can now work perfectly offline - the cost of the display is determined in real time by the method of instant auction. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pna1ZIjGRNw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Video # 4: Technologies for the sale of advertising Addreality Programmatic</i> <br><br>  Using modern communication tool with the buyer, it is important to understand that this is just a tool that hitting non-professional hands can not only increase sales, but worsen them.  Moreover, poor-quality marketing strategy that uses such powerful tools can have the opposite effect.  When developing advertising campaigns, remember - respect for the buyer will return his loyalty to your network. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/455996/">https://habr.com/ru/post/455996/</a></p>
