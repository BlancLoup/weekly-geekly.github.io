Adobe announced that it is launching a new ‚ÄúCC‚Äù (Creative Cloud) package, featuring a new Photoshop CC, InDesign CC, Illustrator CC, Dreamweaver CC, Premiere Pro CC, deep integration with the social features of Behance, desktop access to TypeKit and much more.  Fireworks unfortunately is no longer a tenant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5b6/605/79f/5b660579fa5480732facd59492040179.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  CC is the next generation of Adobe products for 2013 (Creative Suite 7 will not).  Adobe will now offer only its cloud-based product subscription model.

      Like last year, Adobe announced an update on almost all of its core products, which will be available in June.  Now, without the new Creative Suite, pricing will be simplified: most people will have to fork out $ 49.99 per month.  Do not worry if you think that you have been cheated, detailed information about more affordable prices is below.  Let's look at the applications that are now available exclusively to members of the Creative Cloud. <br><br><h4>  Photoshop CC </h4><br>  Adobe's flagship product has received a number of updates: some add-ons are predictable, others more interesting.  Of the major changes, Photoshop Standard and Photoshop Extended were merged into a single product.  This is a good step; fragmentation of Photoshop versions has never made much sense. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6c4/005/d03/6c4005d03844edbfaa42f1e5577d0812.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The Photoshop team spent a lot of time on new features for increasing contrast (Sharpening) and retouching (Healing), and also includes the previously shown amazing features of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/177269/">‚Äúsmart correction of blurred images‚Äù</a> and the Smart Sharpen tool, which reduces the noise level along with the increase in contrast of the photo.  Photoshop CC also adds the functionality recently demonstrated in the Lightroom 5 Beta, an Advanced Healing brush that allows you to use brushes rather than just a standard round brush for editing.  Now you can adjust the radius of the corners at any time, and there is also a preview of the ‚Äúnew workflow‚Äù that makes it easy to switch from Photoshop CC to Edge Reflow CC. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5c9/a56/67d/5c9a5667debede27fa1119f26520ffea.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38b/115/a6e/38b115a6e410ed65b5b6a89b9d339b39.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e80/624/190/e806241900e651e231486f4fa616a5e8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Finally, Photoshop CC is the first application that is fully integrated with Behance.  Users will be able to send files directly to Behance to demonstrate the process of work and finished projects directly on the site (and bypass competing services such as Dribbble). <br><br><h4>  Illustrator cc </h4><br>  For Illustrator, the main addition is the Touch Type, which will give users more control over texts, allowing you to manipulate individual characters as separate objects: ‚ÄúExperiment with moving, scaling, and rotating, knowing that you can always change the font or edit the text.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cc5/605/e18/cc5605e182171ddad066f68c7db20027.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition, Art, Pattern and Scatter brushes may contain bitmap images;  There is a new Sync Fonts feature that allows you to use Typekit fonts on your desktop, and Illustrator can now generate CSS code for icons, patterns and logos with gradient support. <br><br>  Small improvements include the ability to place several files simultaneously with ‚Äúgreat control‚Äù, new synchronization settings and much more. <br><br><h4>  InDesign CC </h4><br><br>  InDesign gets its own 64-bit support, has a redesigned user interface, and now supports HiDPI and Retina displays.  Other, more curious additions include, for example, the creation of a QR code. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d10/3ee/66a/d103ee66ab12bf7a19bf68ee71b76f9f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Dreamweaver CC </h4><br>  Dreamweaver, Adobe‚Äôs oldest web design product, now includes a CSS designer feature that allows users to quickly apply CSS gradients and shadows.  Templates for flexible (rubber) layouts have also been improved, and a jQuery UI widget has been added. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dfd/fab/ed0/dfdfabed0ab2d0a47c177299753fa2e3.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Premiere Pro CC </h4><br>  Adobe‚Äôs mainstream video-editing product now includes reworked Timeline and Link &amp; Locate, which ‚Äúwill help you quickly track your videos no matter where they are transferred‚Äù, Creative Cloud sync and more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cc5/85b/145/cc585b1457c7680891ad441f4880d9b1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Other </h4><br>  Adobe Download Manager has been rethought;  Muse CC now supports parallax scrolling and browser editing;  InCopy CC is now included in Creative Cloud and has a new user interface;  Kuler now has both iPhone apps and a web service with new color sync features;  Adobe Ideas is now free;  Flash Professional CC includes 64-bit architecture and HD export;  Edge Animate SS now includes a motion path and custom templates;  Edge Reflow Preview 3 includes resource management and Typekit integration;  After Effects CC includes the new Refine Edge tool; 3D processes with integration with Cinema 4D, Warp Stabilizer VFX and sync;  Audition CC includes a new Sound Remover, a preview and an ‚Äúimproved‚Äù multi-track editing feature, and finally, the Prelude CC, SpeedGrade CC and Adobe Story Plus are also updated. <br><br><h4>  Services </h4><br>  As mentioned above, the new integration with Typekit will be a very good addition for those obsessed with fonts.  Web designers are very annoyed that you can‚Äôt check your fonts outside the browser.  Now it is fixed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/097/b1c/bfe/097b1cbfe47bdddc8cf52438cebe0f41.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Users of almost all Adobe products should expect closer integration with Behance in the future.  Adobe applications are becoming increasingly social and this can annoy users who want their web services to exist separately from the design process. <br><br><h4>  Prices </h4><br>  If you have an Adobe application suite, you‚Äôll be pleased to know that anyone with CS 3 or later will receive their first year at Creative Cloud for $ 29.99 per month.  For everyone else, full access to CC will cost $ 49.99 per month or you can purchase a subscription to one application for $ 19.99 per month. <br><br>  For work teams, pricing is the same, but you will pay $ 69.99 per month per user or $ 39.99 if you bought CS 3 or later (such packages include much more space in the cloud for data storage).  For students, CC costs $ 19.99 per month for the full version, and there is now a package of "Teams in Education", which offers to pay $ 39.99 per month for a user. <br><br>  In general, SaaS is very much alive.  Good or bad - time will tell. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/178981/">https://habr.com/ru/post/178981/</a></p>
