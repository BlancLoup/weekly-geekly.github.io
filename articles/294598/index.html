  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Analysis of the convenience of viewing the site on mobile devices using Google tools</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The update of Google‚Äôs ranking algorithms <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/google/blog/250089/">on April 21</a> was a signal for many webmasters to adapt their sites to mobile devices - this has officially become a significant factor in ranking a site in search results.  Now, after 5 months, we can say that this trend has not only survived, but continues to evolve.  And this means that it is high time to take measures to ensure that your site is ready for viewing on mobile devices. <br><br>  Here are some facts you need to know about this update: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  The robot scans page by page sequentially and checks them in real time. </li><li>  Evaluation of readiness of the page for display on mobile devices is binary: either the page is being tested or not.  There are no intermediate values. </li><li>  Google provided tools to check the convenience of viewing on mobile devices. </li><li>  Just waiting for this update increased the rate of responsive pages by 5% two months before the release. </li></ul><br>  If the page passes the test, it is marked with an icon in the mobile version of the search results.  Many major western websites such as Reddit, NBC Sports, Vogue, SongLyrics, and Business Week did not have time to make changes and significantly lost ground. <br><br>  So, what should be done in order not to repeat their sad experience?

      As already mentioned, Google has launched several tools for analyzing the work of the site. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/">Check the convenience of viewing on mobile devices</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ff/f41/a67/7fff41a676eb4e7c98f791ace9f78fd9.png"><br>  <i>Great result, what to say</i> <br><br>  The principle of operation is very simple: copy the address of the page to be checked, wait and analyze the result.  The check is not quick, usually seconds 20-40.  The test results are pretty visual and allow you to quickly find problem areas.  Most often it is: ‚ÄúToo small font‚Äù, ‚ÄúNo viewport for mobile devices‚Äù, ‚ÄúContent is wider than the screen‚Äù, ‚ÄúLinks are too close to each other‚Äù.  The service will definitely swear to use Flash - in the modern world it is getting worse and worse.  This service should be used first of all to check the site. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">Google PageSpeed ‚Äã‚ÄãInsights</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae6/7e3/69a/ae67e369a6ce44ad9319d5c044271f88.png"><br>  <i>Hmm, how is it?</i> <br><br>  Wonderful, albeit rather strict service, which was mentioned more than once and twice on Habr√©, and which any site must be checked (in my personal opinion).  The principle of operation is the same - enter the link, wait, we get a number of comments and page evaluation.  The higher the better, but rarely can anyone achieve a result of 100 points, especially if the site uses Yandex.metric / google analytics and other connected scripts. <br><br>  So, how is it useful?  First, it conducts a similar page check as the previous service (but slightly faster).  Secondly - PageSpeed, as the name implies, is designed to analyze and optimize page loading speed.  This is an important ranking factor, and it has been taken into account for quite some time.  And in any case, a slowly loading page always loses visitors.  PageSpeed ‚Äã‚Äãmakes recommendations not only on the appearance of the page on mobile devices, but also reminds you about what to turn on caching, set gzip / deflate resource compression, minify css and js, and also remove them at the end of the code so as not to block the download.  But in practice, the biggest increase in speed is provided by the optimization of images - this resource is usually loaded the longest.  A utility called FileOptimizer allows you to solve this problem quickly enough, except for it there are a number of server utilities and analogues - in general, there would be a desire. <br><br>  Also, you can get recommendations for ease of viewing in the developer tools - <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/">www.google.com/webmasters/tools</a> (if you already have an account).  There you can get all the error messages on your site, graphics and other valuable information.  Unfortunately, the amount of information provided by this service is so great that its analysis will be enough for several separate articles. <br><br>  I have not found similar tools from Yandex, or other domestic analogues, but I think that these two tools should be quite enough.  In extreme cases, you can use emulators: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.mobilephoneemulator.com/">www.mobilephoneemulator.com</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://mattkersley.com/responsive/">mattkersley.com/responsive</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.responsinator.com/">www.responsinator.com</a> </li></ul><br>  Well, or even the developer console in Google Chrome - there is also a great mobile device emulator, with all the functionality of the developer panel. <br><br><h2>  Instead of conclusion </h2><br>  Today, every webmaster, to whom the attendance of his sites is important, must take into account how well his creations are displayed on tablets and smartphones.  This can no longer be ignored, citing a small percentage of such users.  Perhaps soon their number will exceed those who come to your site from a computer or laptop.  It is extremely important to make timely changes in the layout and structure of the site.  Google provides convenient tools for analyzing the work of the site, which has no analogues - they will help you to keep and keep users.  And those who have already adapted their sites will be useful from time to time to check the new pages, so as not to miss anything important. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294598/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294598/</a></p>
