      For a beekeeper, the question of bees and honey confrontation is not worth it; these are two parts of a single whole.  In theory, goals and values ‚Äã‚Äãare two parts of a single harmonious approach to development.  Achieving the goal should answer the question ‚Äúwhat to do?‚Äù, And the observance of values ‚Äã‚Äãto the question ‚Äúhow to do?‚Äù. <br><br>  In reality, I observe that different people, companies, nations, states use different approaches.  If priority is given to values, goals are lame; if priority is given to goals, values ‚Äã‚Äãmay change or even be lost for the sake of goals. <br><br>  What is value?  If you give a physical analogy - then this is the potential field.  This is an understanding of where I am and how I should be, because values ‚Äã‚Äãare what I have to respect, where I should have been. <br><br>  What is the goal?  This is a vector from the current position, this is a certain point where I do not yet exist.  To reach this point, you need to apply an action, you need to get to it. <br><br>  Respecting values ‚Äã‚Äãis a focus inward.  If you are in the field of your values ‚Äã‚Äã- you do not need special proactive actions.  Therefore, management by values ‚Äã‚Äãis situational, in some ways even passive, it becomes necessary if external new circumstances begin to fluctuate your values.  A goal, by nature, is always a manifestation of dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs.  On the contrary, achieving the goal requires a proactive approach and planning, and the subject of the effort is directed at the external environment. <br><br>  In a state of high uncertainty, value management is more resilient than goal management.  For example, during crisis periods, the planning contour is reduced.  In some cases, companies switch to a response mode, when a decision on each issue is made on the fact of the issue.  You may not have a goal, but value, as an internal state, always lives.  The embodiment of value in the company is a corporate culture. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>Recently, on the Internet, I found an interesting thesis: "If people do not unite around an idea, they unite around salary."</i>  <i>It‚Äôs bad when value is wealth.</i>  <i>When money is the goal, this is also bad.</i> <br><br>  So it seems to me that our culture is more focused on managing by values, and western - by goals. <br><br>  <b>Example.</b>  Religion is an institution that forms the self-consciousness of a people.  In Orthodox schools, they study the subject ‚ÄúHistory of Orthodoxy‚Äù, which basically consists of stories about how the church reacted to external influences and removed from itself what it called heresies.  That is, the work is mainly carried out on the preservation of values.  If you look at the western experience, the historical achievements of the Western churches are the crusades and proselytism of the twentieth century, for example, the invasion of various Protestant churches in Moscow in the early 90s.  That is, mainly work is done on the external spread of religion.  That is, the first are governed by values, the second by objectives. <br><br>  <b>Another example.</b>  Every year, Microsoft developed a new development strategy for the next fiscal year.  For example, from the point of view of social communications, at the end of the 2000s, it was customary to do socialization on SharePoint.  In 2012, Yammer was purchased, the development of social tools SharePoint has stopped.  Then, the concept of unified groups prevailed in Office 365 and Yammer was pushed aside.  Now moves the topic of cloud services from partners.  So even if the new goal changed to the previous one by 180%, our European colleagues came at the beginning of the new year and talked about how Microsoft began to go correctly and how everyone will now tremble.  What a stupor Russian colleagues.  After all, if the goal was reversed, and tomorrow it was reversed again, then why run in an unnecessary direction?  I will say this - for those who did not reflect on this topic and simply accepted new goals, it was easier. <br><br>  <b>Another example.</b>  In August 1998, I bought a bag of food and shoes for salary, and there was no more money left in our family.  There was only an incomprehensible future ahead.  And after a while I was interviewed by a Western company, where I was asked about my plans for the future.  To which I replied that I have been afraid to plan for more than two years.  The recruiter looked at me quietly, and from her glance I immediately understood everything about my future in this company.  If you want to get a job in a Western company, prepare a story about your goals for 5, 10 and 25 years.  This is a required part of the program. <br><br><br>  <b>Findings.</b> <br><br>  We are what we are and with our Western colleagues we think in slightly different categories.  It sits very deeply and in five minutes you will not change yourself.  And whether? <br>  In general, it's great when goals and values ‚Äã‚Äãare in harmony with each other. <br><br>  <b>Vladimir Ivanitsa</b> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ivanitsa"><u>Facebook</u></a> |  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivanitsa"><u>LinkedIn</u></a> <br>  company founder <a href="http://www.supereon.ru/about/"><u>Supereon</u></a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300568/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300568/</a></p>
