    <h2>  Characteristics of the column </h2><br>  The ENEBY columns are part of the IKEA Home Smart initiative aimed at developing the smart home ecosystem.  Its first phase was the release of <a href="https://www.curbed.com/2015/4/16/9969994/ikea-wireless-charging-available-spring">furniture</a> with integrated Qi wireless charging for phones.  The second is the release of TR√ÖDFRI <a href="https://www.curbed.com/2017/5/23/15681620/ikea-smart-lighting-amazon-echo-apple-homekit-google-home">smart lighting</a> , compatible with Amazon Alexa, Google Home and Apple HomeKit home assistants. <br><br>  ENEBY is supplied in two form factors: 30 by 30 and 20 by 20 cm ( <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/search/%3Fquery%3DENEBY%26x%3D0%26y%3D0%26cid%3Daf%257Cde%257Cno_cc_topic%257C7xOgOqleGDAkWJuZGAAA33fpj5Dzni%26affmt%3D2%26affmn%3D4">photo and product cards in the official store</a> ).  Their cost is 89 and 49 dollars respectively.  Two color schemes are available: black and white-gray.  A 20 centimeter version has a handle, and a 30 centimeter version is replaced by a rear bass reflex port. <br><br>  In order to save electricity, an auto off function is provided - the speakers are automatically turned off if they are idle for a long time.  It is possible to connect one gadget directly via a 3.5mm cable or up to 8 devices via Bluetooth. <br><br>  The design of the column is designed so that it fits in with the proportions of IKEA furniture, for example, Kallax and Eket shelving.  Also for ENEBY is sold separately stand ENEBY Speaker Stand.  For the 20-centimeter version, you can purchase an additional battery, which will extend the operating time of the device for 10 hours and will allow you to use it as a portable speaker. <br><br>  While there is no possibility to order the device through the site, but both its versions are already available in stores in the US and the UK. <br><br><h2>  Other IKEA experiments with sound </h2><br>  ENEBY is not the first IKEA project, "connected" with sound.  In June 2017, the retailer <a href="https://newsroom.inter.ikea.com/news/upcoming-collection-frekvens-ikea-and-teenage-engineering-in-collaboration/s/6c20233d-1766-45da-a199-5c4e1f4d5389">announced</a> a collaboration with Teenage Engineering, a Swedish audio equipment company.  She is known for the development of synthesizers, in particular, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Engineering_OP-1">OP-1</a> , awarded <a href="http://design-s.se/en/designs2012-en/winners-en/">the</a> Design S <a href="http://design-s.se/en/designs2012-en/winners-en/">award</a> in 2012.  Within the framework of cooperation, a series of music devices FREKVENS is being developed, which means ‚Äúfrequency‚Äù (frequency). <br><br>  The collection will include turntables, party lighting and a variety of speakers.  In a June 2017 <a href="http://ikea.today/get-ready-for-a-new-party-experience/">interview with</a> IDEAtoday, Jesper Kouthoofd, CEO of Teenage Engineering, said that about 22 devices and facilities would be developed.  The FREKVENS series will go on sale only in 2019, but two months ago the company <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BfLn_P1F3DR/">posted a</a> snapshot of several prototypes in its instagram. <br><br><h2>  Partnership with Sonos </h2><br>  In December 2017, IKEA <a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/this-is-ikea/newsroom/press-release/ikea-and-sonos-collaborate/">announced</a> a partnership with the American company Sonos, which specializes in home audio systems and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2582-%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA">smart speakers</a> (smart-speakers). <br><br>  Cooperation with Sonos allows IKEA to integrate with a variety of audio services: Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora and Audible, as well as popular voice assistants - Amazon Alexa is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/6/16741194/sonos-ikea-partnership-home-smart">already</a> supported, Google Assistant is in the <a href="https://en.community.sonos.com/controllers-software-228995/sonos-one-and-google-assistant-6803124">process of</a> implementation.  Work is underway to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/02/03/sonos-ceo-competing-with-homepod/">integrate</a> Apple's Siri. <br><br>  ‚ÄúTogether with Sonos, we want to democratize music and sound in the home,‚Äù said Bj√∂rn Block, business leader at IKEA Smart Home.  In turn, Patrick Spence, CEO of Sonos, added: ‚ÄúWe at Sonos understand the transformative power of music, and we believe that sound should be considered as an element of home design.‚Äù <br><br>  Therefore, according <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/6/16741194/sonos-ikea-partnership-home-smart">to</a> Thomas Ricker, The Verge journalist, we can expect the appearance of IKEA furniture with sound capabilities that will announce events on the calendar or report that a guest is on the doorstep.  A partnership can also lead to just selling Sonos equipment in IKEA stores.  However, this is only an assumption. <br><br><h2>  Related initiatives of other companies </h2><br>  IKEA is not the only company that develops non-core solutions for itself.  Recently <a href="https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2018/02/14/report-facebook-releasing-smart-speakers-july/">it became</a> known that Facebook launches two smart speakers.  Devices codenamed Fiona and Aloha must compete with Amazon Echo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/az/pf/bc/azpfbckndyhrahhgb6cha5f7itq.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/29233640%40N07/40699742711/">Robert Couse-Baker</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC</a></i></font> <br><br>  Aloha is a device with a 15-inch touch screen, as well as face and voice recognition functions.  It will also include the functions of the messenger and social network Facebook.  Still in operation, according <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20180214PD207.html">to</a> Digitimes, is a 13-inch version of the device.  About Fiona is known much less, except for the alleged presence of a voice assistant, similar to Siri. <br><br>  Last year, Facebook <a href="https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2017/07/21/is-facebook-building-a-modular-smart-phone">patented a</a> modular device, the shape of which resembles a smartphone or smart speaker.  <a href="https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2018/02/14/report-facebook-releasing-smart-speakers-july/">According to</a> Bloomberg, the patent may be related to two new devices, but the IT giant has not yet provided any development information.  It is known that the devices can enter the market <a href="https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2018/02/14/report-facebook-releasing-smart-speakers-july/">in July of</a> this year. <br><br>  While on the market of smart speakers, several companies have already consolidated, for which this direction is not core.  Amazon Echo's digital assistant leads, with a sales share of about 73% in the first quarter of 2018, according <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-12/apple-s-stumbling-homepod-isn-t-the-hot-seller-company-wanted">to</a> Bloomberg. <br><br>  In second place is Google Home with 14%.  In the last quarter of 2017, more than 7.6 million Google Home products <a href="https://www.voicebot.ai/2018/01/06/7-6-million-google-home-products-sold-q4-2017/">were sold</a> .  But Apple HomePod sales <a href="https://mashable.com/2018/04/12/apple-homepod-sales-poor/">continue</a> to fall.  One of the main reasons is the price of a new product of $ 350.  For comparison, various Amazon Echo models cost between $ 50 and $ 230, while Google Home counterparts can be purchased for $ 50 (Home Mini) and $ 130 (Home) dollars. <br><br>  Another reason for the unpopularity of Apple‚Äôs voice products is in part <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4078591-google-assistant-smarter-siri-cortana-alexa">the</a> ‚Äúclosedness‚Äù of the ecosystem.  While Google and Amazon products <a href="https://mashable.com/2018/04/03/apple-hires-google-ai-exec-john-giannandrea/">support</a> thousands of third-party applications, Apple allows only select applications to integrate with their voice assistant. <br><br>  However, the company does not plan to lose the promising market.  There are <a href="https://www.imore.com/homepod-2">rumors</a> about the development of a budget mini-version of the smart speaker HomePod.  Also in early April, Apple <a href="https://mashable.com/2018/04/03/apple-hires-google-ai-exec-john-giannandrea/">hired</a> Google's former AI lead developer, John Giannandrea, to lead Google. <br><br>  The market of smart home systems is actively developing, and, according <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/279/109/smart-home/united-states">to</a> Statista, will reach 32 billion dollars by 2022.  And it is only in the USA.  It is therefore not surprising that companies are beginning to offer their own solutions in this area.  In this regard, the output of the ENEBY column from IKEA looks like a logical step. <br><br>  Materials for additional reading from our ‚ÄúHi-Fi World‚Äù: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/blog/300161/">40 Hi-Fi Mini Systems, Soundbars and Portable Wireless Acoustics Reviews</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5161.html">10 reasons why you need a multi-room audio system</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5285.html">Room acoustics: foundation (part 1)</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5465.html">‚ÄúGosh, a giant bug has flown over me‚Äù: SDK release for surround sound</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5302.html">How the arrival of stereo changed life in post-war America, or a small orchestra in the living room</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374437/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374437/</a></p>
