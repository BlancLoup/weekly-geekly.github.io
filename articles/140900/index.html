    <h5>  Appearance: </h5><br>  The headset is designed as a mini-phone with an OLED display containing 3 lines of text - the top line contains indicators: bluetooth status icon, sound mode indicator, presence or absence of a vibration, lock icon, signal level and battery status. <br>  The size of the device in length is equal to a credit card or, as in my case, a subway map.  Officially declared dimensions: 88 x 40 x 5 mm, but I would say that the thickness is still closer to 7 mm.  In any case, this is a very small device.  No, seriously, very small and light.  In comparison with the same well-known miniphone, the headset feels like a feather. <br>  The headset is made of white glossy plastic with metal edging.  The edging is also plastic.  There will also be a black version with a similar edging for metal. <br>  All connectors are located on the bottom, it is a microUSB for charging the headset, 3.5 mm Jack for connecting headphones and a loop for attaching the strap.  The latter may not be superfluous, given the low weight of the headset and the high probability of losing it and just not noticing it. <br><br><h5>  Contents of delivery: </h5><br>  In a compact transparent blister with a headset there is an instruction in Russian, a warranty card, a cord for wearing a headset on your neck and a microUSB-USB cable for charging the headset. <br>  The charging cord is very short, only 25 cm from one connector to the other.  It will be convenient to connect the headset to a laptop, but not very much to a stationary computer. <br>  Anyway, I think most readers probably have a charger or a longer cord with the right connectors, so there shouldn't be any problems with charging the device. <br><br><h5>  Specifications: </h5><br><br>  Screen: OLED;  128x64 pixels <br>  Frequency range 2.402 GHz ~ 2.480 GHz <br>  Radius of action ~ 10 m. <br>  Supported Protocols HFP, HSP, AVRCP, A2DP <br>  Battery: Non-removable lithium-ion battery, 200 mAh <br>  Bluetooth: V2.1 + EDR <br>  Dimensions: 88x40x5 mm. <br>  Mass: 15 g. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/76c/876/f7b/76c876f7b44e45e1cb0c9bb5c7df7d32.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/65c/105/e22/65c105e2264410f3e093a3d925078063.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fcf/28a/76e/fcf28a76ee0184bc52aa4b705bd4a18f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3fd/106/a23/3fd106a233c89f282ade3e1e59e72f45.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Experience of use: </h5><br>  I tried to test the work of the headset with 3 devices at once, with which to some extent it would be logical to use this headset. <br><br>  The first was the tablet MegaFon V9 +, manufactured by ZTE.  The tablet has a slot for a SIM card in it, in addition, the standard firmware provides for the use of the tablet as a regular Android phone.  One inconvenience - in the tablet there is no telephone speaker, so you can talk on it or through a speakerphone, or through a headset.  It is understandable, a person holding a 7-inch tablet as a phone near the ear would look rather strange.  Yes, and the hand would quickly tired.  MicrON connected without problems, the tablet saw it as a BT device and I was able to talk quite calmly.  The first test was successful, when dialing a number from a headset and pressing a call, the tablet asked what action to perform - a call through a SIM card or via a Multiphone over the network, I chose a call through Sim by default and the following calls were made without having to get the tablet out of the bag or pocket.  In addition, the headset allows you to control the player, you can use the special keys to switch tracks, change the volume. <br>  In the same way, you can safely use any program for VoIP and make calls from the tablet via the network, without getting it from the case / bag / pocket, etc. <br>  Conveniently. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f36/31d/33a/f3631d33a80eeb9060f08f3c2c8e0037.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The second on testing was the HP ProBook 6550b laptop with Windows 7 on board. <br>  It also just turned out to make friends two devices, the laptop installed all the drivers itself and suggested using MicrON as a headset.  Basic music playback control is also possible, no unexpected features.  The sound is acceptable, we are not tied to the computer by wire, you can negotiate and move around the room or make tea if negotiations are delayed. <br>  The headset allows you to move a maximum of 10 meters from the connected device, and then begins to signal rather loudly about the interrupted connection.  So it does not steal unnoticed, despite the small size.  Also not bad, plus you can charge the headset from the laptop. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9a3/531/ca8/9a3531ca84008b394aaa5a79c4be6aec.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The third device.  It turned out to be my Nokia C3-01 phone.  The connection is performed through the search for audio accessories, everything is normal, the headset was quickly found and connected.  The sound when you call is satisfactory, you can control the player, listening to music. <br>  Nokia was the only device from which the headset tried to load contacts with some success, however, they were displayed in unreadable characters in the device itself, since  the phone was hammered in Russian, most likely. <br>  Despite a slight complaint to the address of the phone book, the headset stores a list of calls made, you can redial the number from the memory or immediately dial the number from the headset keyboard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/351/1ae/398/3511ae39817b85937db68feaee802c03.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/935/deb/986/935deb986af71ddef1135db349bdb78d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Due to the small size of my phone, using such a headset with it does not seem adequate, but as a VoIP headset or headset to the tablet, I would have bought it myself. <br><br>  In Russia, this device is sold under the brand BB-Mobile and has a cost of 1,550 rubles. <br>  In fairness, I climbed on dealextreme.com and found two similar headsets, here are the links to them. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.dealextreme.com/p/designer-s-rechargeable-0-9-oled-bluetooth-stereo-headset-telephone-keypad-dial-answer-white-71583">Device 1</a> <br>  The most similar headset to the one presented in the review is a slightly different key design, although, I wager, absolutely the same functionality.  The headset is sold out, its cost was $ 45.99. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.dealextreme.com/p/0-9-oled-bluetooth-v3-0-edr-a2dp-avrcp-pbap-map-stereo-headset-10-hour-talk-200-hour-standby-103714">Device 2</a> <br>  A slightly less similar headset, with a slight difference in performance, although it is not very important, I think.  You can buy it now, it is available, the cost is $ 43.20 <br><br>  It is not difficult to calculate that both the above-presented headsets will cost about the same in rubles as the MicrON-1, but they are unlikely to have a Russified menu and a supplier guarantee. <br><br>  Yes, you can use a regular mono headset with the same tablet, but then you have to constantly get the tablet out of its case / bag / pocket for dialing. <br><br>  Pros: <br>  + Original Form Factor <br>  + Lightweight device <br>  + Ability to dial without needing to get a tablet <br>  + Can be used as a remote control for the player (Standard AVRCP) <br>  + You can listen to music in stereo mode (A2DP standard) <br>  + Russian menu <br>  + Standard headphone jack and charging <br><br>  Minuses: <br>  -Not very correct work with contacts <br>  -Very fine screen <br>  - Too short lace supplied <br><br>  I was able to contact the representative office of the supplier.  Here is a comment by Evgeniy Kosmosov, CEO of BB-mobile: <br><blockquote> Naturally, BB-mobile micrON is designed and released in Asia.  And on sites offering electronics from this region, similar models are available.  However, our device, firstly, is guaranteed and, secondly, it works quite correctly with Cyrillic.  Meanwhile, similar headsets, which you order from abroad, may well turn out to be inoperable - after all, they will not even be able to be tested before purchasing.  They may turn out to be a bit cheaper, and there will be people willing to take the risk.  However, in our opinion, an overpayment of several hundred rubles is fully justified - we repeat, because of the availability of a guarantee and the localization of the device. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140900/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140900/</a></p>
