At first they hauled them on all the new cars.  And everyone was happy.  ‚ÄúLook,‚Äù they said, ‚Äúhow awesome it is.‚Äù  Now you can not sit behind the wheel. "  Then they banned the production of new cars without autopilot.  Then these fucking glands learned to communicate with each other and tell each other what each of them sees.  Here they only shared this not only among themselves, but also with some others.  No, of course the order on the roads has become more, and there are fewer accidents.  But how the hell it was unpleasant, especially because of unaccustomed use, when you crossed the road in the wrong place, and a dozen and a dozen fucking pieces of people who saw it immediately came up to you. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Well, then they simply banned from traveling on the road without an autopilot.  It was here that for the first time everyone began to be really indignant.  How so?  What should I do with my favorite old car?  Well, these calmly answered them - like, what are you worried, total XX thousand money, and your old car will get a second life with our new autopilot.  Yeah, especially if the old trough itself is ten times cheaper than this fucking autopilot.  Well, nothing, as always, pound, pound, and ceased.  We got used to it. <br><br>  But it was all flowers.  But the most interesting thing started further.  At first, we were simply asked to inform us in advance about where we were going to go.  This, like, helps them optimize and predict traffic.  It seems like voluntarily.  While voluntarily.  But not for long.  It was felt that they liked it.  Not much time had passed before the preliminary planning of trips became mandatory.  That is, if you want to go somewhere, then be kind in advance to pave the route and report about it.  And even better for the whole week ahead.  No, of course, it was possible to go right away, without informing in advance, but for this you had to pay such money that very few people could often afford to ride like that.  True, if you plan all the routes in advance, there are five or seven days ahead, then you and some bonuses will be thrown.  So they began to live - at the weekend for the week ahead you estimate, when you go to work - you go from work, when and where to take the child - to bring, when you go to the store or the cinema and all other trifles, it means you think it over beforehand.  And nothing, accustomed.

      Well, as soon as they got used to it, the apotheosis of this whole story immediately came.  If earlier it was necessary to simply inform that they were going to go there and there, now they could easily say to you: ‚ÄúSorry, your planned trip at a specified time is impossible due to the high traffic load of the highway.  We recommend to postpone the trip for a while from so much to so many. ‚Äù  This means they began to recommend me when and where to go.  And the main thing is that you can‚Äôt do anything about it, because the manual control mode of the car was completely removed a few years ago along with the next system update ‚Äúdue to the high danger to the driver and others‚Äù.  That is, only with autopilot, and now, it means, only if you are allowed. <br><br>  Now I‚Äôm sitting and wondering: "If I‚Äôm allowed to come to the supermarket right away from me on my next Friday, or have to go there late in the evening, when the roads are more free." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369291/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369291/</a></p>
