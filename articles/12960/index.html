      What's inside the new iMac? <br>  2.4GHz Core 2 processor, 4GB of RAM.  ATI Radeon HD graphics card, up to 1TB hard drive.  802.11n Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 2.0 are built in. <br>  "Today we are replacing the 24" model, reducing the price by $ 200 in the younger model, and the older model with a 20-inch screen is also $ 1,499. " <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/59d/a6a/587/59da6a5873e07d2bb46b69cfe50f4e9e.jpg"><br><br>  New keyboard, like a laptop, more thin, wireless! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a65/d5d/620/a65d5d620733de9435131c53922370bf.jpg"><br><br>  "Much more subtle." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/898/acc/c3b/898accc3bcfdf265088e888eb5bdc492.jpg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúOk, now about the applications that run on the Mac.  Introducing iLife '08.  Completely new package, a huge leap compared with the first release.  iPhoto, iMovie, iWeb, iDVD and GarageBand.  We replaced one application so that everything moves to a new, higher level. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eec/3f9/494/eec3f9494fa034f0c066e7f51b338d7f.jpg"><br><br>  iPhoto. <br>  ‚ÄúWe have added events to the program.  With the development of the photo market and the cheapening of cameras, photographing is available to absolutely everyone and now we understand that there are too many photos on the computer, and the search for the right one is already difficult.  What is an event?  This is your "Birthday", "Party" and the like. <br>  On average, you take about 50 photos per event, and now on Mac you need to search not among 5,000 photos, but among 100 events. <br>  What photos belong to the event?  Those that are made on the same day.  But what if the birthday is in the morning and the wedding in the evening?  Just scatter on 2 events.  Conversely, events can be combined. <br>  Now you can watch only the necessary photos, for example, in which you have 3 stars in the rating.  You can take a description of one photo and assign the entire event. <br>  Steve Jobs shows everything on Mac himself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/21f/c71/153/21fc71153e48fe042d7db8c1e6d2199b.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c79/87f/d8e/c7987fd8ef699cd48a2c3581fee2ec89.jpg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúWe all know the .Mac service, he already has 1.7 million subscribers.  Now you can create web galleries, all integrated with iPhoto, just one click and a photo online.  A true web 2.0 experience. " <br>  Describes how great it is, and with mosaic you can see both the slide show and the carousel. <br>  ‚ÄúYou can also upload photos from iPhone!  Just click post online, and the photo from iPhone will appear on .Mac.  This web 2.0 application. ‚Äù <br>  Now Schiller demonstrates it from the audience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a1c/c34/a17/a1cc34a1798cda77389fc3d17a0f9968.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c13/428/ece/c13428ece521e185b7e6aa72fbe5eefa.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/970/f3f/fd4/970f3ffd436ebf1e67dfd8b5f1e0dfee.jpg"><br><br>  Steve begins a story about iMovie. <br>  He tells how one of the engineers on vacation argued that he could make a film in half an hour and could not.  And after that he made an application that can do this! <br>  ‚ÄúWe were so shocked that we decided to include this app in iLife!  The name remains the same - iMovie, but it now has a new icon, as this is another application.  One library for the entire video. <br>  One library for everything, whatever you shoot: video camera, HD, telephone.  View them as photos, scroll.  You can add music, photos, anything, make a movie! <br>  Through iTunes, you can watch on your computer, iPod, iPhone, Apple TV, download not the video for 8 gigs, but the link to YouTube. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9f2/e07/8f9/9f2e078f999af068f312c162900fb282.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5a6/fd9/3eb/5a6fd93eb5a8f3721614bb586675e987.jpg"><br><br>  Moves to demo. <br>  ‚ÄúNow iWeb.  You can add ads from Google - Adsense and earn.  Now we support our own domains. ‚Äù <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e2b/b6e/201/e2bb6e201a3af4dc93a977ff806363c5.jpg"><br>  &lt;img src = " <a href="">www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.engadget.com/media/2007/08/dsc_1347.jpg</a> &gt; <br>  &lt;img src = " <a href="">www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.engadget.com/media/2007/08/dsc_1352.jpg</a> &gt; <br><br>  ‚ÄúGo to iDVD.  There are still people who want to make a DVD.  We added themes, advanced coding, high resolution. " <br><br>  GarageBand <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2f3/d8e/f51/2f3d8ef519d059a2e343ab3eadfede9b.jpg"><br><br>  Little has changed, miss. <br><br>  ‚ÄúEverything is on sale today, with new Macs for free, and iLife costs $ 79 separately.  And .Mac is now at 10 gigabytes and costs $ 99.95 a year. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúNow iLife.  This is Keynote and Pages.  I am glad to announce that we sold 1.8M copies of this package. <br>  In Keynote, new themes, effects.  Just take a photo, insert, animation and all that. ‚Äù(If you want to know what the program is, then look at Jobs‚Äôs presentation, you‚Äôve done this program for him, and then released it for everyone) <br>  Tells about Pages (Nothing new radically) <br><br>  New Nimbers app !!!  (Numbers) (Analog Excel) <br>  ‚ÄúDigital tables, there are only one figures around us.‚Äù Proceed to the demonstration. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/055/93b/1c2/05593b1c2b65fe8e4cc9310a1cd2ef3a.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f57/06d/285/f5706d285c283e1300a31e694debd326.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ec5/55f/c18/ec555fc18ec8612d7c28372a3adbec0a.jpg"><br><br>  "It works with Tiger, it will be from October with the Leopard and all for $ 79," <br><br>  Now the questions have gone, the presentation itself is over. <br><br>  Tim Cook and Phil Schiller also answer questions. <br><br>  - How do you make all products work in the ecosystem? <br>  - We have great users, they show their friends and they start to envy. <br><br>  - Mac has Intel inside, why are there no stickers? <br>  - What can I say?  Well, we like our stickers.  Don't get it wrong, we love Intel, we just better tell you what's inside. <br><br>  (I'll skip a couple ad iMac) <br><br>  - Anything about Mac mini today? <br>  - We recycle this line today. <br><br>  -Advertising from Google?  Have you gotten closer with them? <br>  - We like their products and we use them.  They like ours. <br><br>  -How is Apple TV? <br>  - We are talking today about Macs, you‚Äôll hear about Apple TV soon. <br><br>  What about AMD? <br>  -We have Intel <br><br>  - What about Macs in business? <br>  - We have a huge growth, including in this segment. <br><br>  - You talk a lot about video, why don't you support HD? <br>  -We support, just the lenses of the cameras do not support this resolution, it doesn‚Äôt hold out a bit.  We use this resolution, it's a bit not HD, but very close.  This is all that devices allow cheaper than 10 000 dollars, do you think this is so bad? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8e1/f19/b22/8e1f19b229d47c59027f2c49064d6a57.jpg"><br><br>  - Multitouch for iPhone, why not for Mac? <br>  - For iPhone, it makes sense to use it, for Mac it is not sure.  Let's call this a research project. <br><br>  - and the last question.  There is an opinion that Apple is more suitable elite than a mass user.  Do you have a goal to beat a PC in the market? <br>  - Our goal is to make the best PC in the world.  In our industry there are things that we would not be proud of releasing.  We can not release garbage.  There are boundaries that we will not cross.  But we want to make the best personal computer.  Our products are usually not the average price.  But take the computers of our competitors and add all the extras that go beyond iron and what we provide.  We do not sell bare computers.  When comparing, we win.  Thanks for coming today. <br><br>  Novelties were expected, all except Numbers, this program was talked about for a long time, but no one was sure.  In my opinion, this is the most interesting thing today, but it's better to talk about it after studying all the programs, and Numbers is so special. <br>  And Mac mini will be! <br>  After the presentation, it turned out that Front Row and Aperture were updated (available from the update panel) <br>  Thank you all. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/12960/">https://habr.com/ru/post/12960/</a></p>
