  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How I received a certificate of state registration of rights to a copyright object in Kazakhstan</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day, I decided to tell you about my experience in obtaining a certificate of state registration of rights to an object of copyright in Kazakhstan for a program code.  It was in 2011 and in the light of recent events around copyrights and patents, I think it will be interesting.  True, my experience tells about the registration of copyright in Kazakhstan. <br>  A bit of prehistory, the administration thought at work to register the copyright of our program code.  Unfortunately, the motive of the leadership is still unknown to me, I received no answer.  We developed an automated information system (AIS) for the company. <br>  Let's proceed to the registration process itself.  Go to the website of the Committee on Intellectual Property Rights of the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Kazakhstan.  We find there the Instruction on the state registration of rights to works protected by copyright and related rights.  This includes poems, music, stories, maps, plans, sketches, illustrations and program code or as written on the website of a computer program. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When registering programs for an electronic computer (hereinafter - the computer), the databases are presented: <br>  1) application; <br>  2) media with a computer program, database (diskette, etc.); <br>  3) abstract of a computer program or database, including the name of the computer program, database, name (last name, first name, patronymic) of the applicant, date of creation, scope, purpose, functionality, basic technical characteristics, programming language, type of implementing computer etc.; <br>  4) a copy of the document certifying the identity of the applicant. <br><br>  Computer programs (software systems), which include several computer programs, are subject to registration as a whole. <br><br>  With the first, second and fourth paragraph, everything is clear. <br>  The third point implied that it was necessary to write a lot of documentation, which we had never kept.  The abstract of the program was not a problem, then draw a block diagram.  And the worst thing is to make applications for functionality.  This is a copy of the software code in the Word.  Creepy occupation copy-paste all the code. <br>  The documents were prepared and sent to the capital of our country - Astana. <br>  Soon came the answer that you need to appear in person at the Ministry of Justice.  We are going on the road, take a laptop, arrive in Astana, we arrive at the ministry. <br>  The protection itself was to install a copy of the AIS from disk to laptop, run it and show that everything works.  As well as selectively demonstrate the code, and the code is compared with the sent applications. <br>  This whole demonstration took about an hour.  I got the impression that there is no special case for inspectors, it was as if reluctantly.  In general, it remains a mystery to me how the source code was assessed, its uniqueness and so on.  Apparently, at best, it was compared with a database of other, already registered, programs in Kazakhstan. <br>  Be that as it may, after about two weeks, the very evidence of the state registration of rights to the copyright object came to us.  The authors of the program are listed with my boss, and the rights are transferred to the company as it should be. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6c8/99c/0cf/6c899c0cf6b0e571af0e96e003099c24.png"><br>  Such is the story, it would be interesting to find out how it happens in Russia and other CIS countries, and it is especially interesting how it happens in the West. </div>
