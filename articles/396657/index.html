      Concerning the ‚Äúsleep‚Äù, in a theoretical and empirical way he derived what increases ‚Äúsleepiness‚Äù: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/609/05b/09f/60905b09f627fa61c715b373008ebf82.jpg" alt="image"><br>  - The quality of sleep is affected by the production of the hormone melatonin, and its peak production occurs at 23h and 4am.  so in these moments, at a minimum, you must sleep.  Melatonin is rapidly destroyed with even low light and heat.  Therefore, it is recommended to sleep with very dark curtains.  And you need to cool the room to +18 - +20 degrees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/234/f5f/56f/234f5f56f8511f221c9bb113f0a985b6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  - It is necessary to beat out the body, for example, the soldiers have no problems falling asleep and the old servicemen can get enough sleep in 3-4 hours, because the body understands that it is necessary to cram more deep sleep in less time.  Nothing helped me get enough sleep, like an hour and a half of walks with a very quick step.  In this case, running for adults is dangerous for the knees.  Quick step is our everything.  Moreover, it is easy to combine it with life: you walk more without an elevator, go to the store, take out the garbage, walk the walker.  Knocked out the body = calmly asleep. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/67a/d69/336/67ad6933611f79067538e9f370631761.jpg" alt="image"><br>  - Nothing helps me sleep like the absence of hanging questions and cases, for example, when I did everything I planned, the next morning you get up early and sleep.  Therefore, it is necessary to calculate all the pending questions, and this is done by writing them out on separate pieces of paper and decide what you will do and what will not.  The head is released and you sleep soundly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/002/170/bbb/002170bbb396926f621be3b142da487b.png" alt="image"><br>  - It is necessary to get up and go to bed on a schedule, so that the body knows the mode in advance and knows how long it takes to carry out all the self-diagnosis processes.  Imagine that at night you should just stand in line for a diagnostician who programs you and your internal organs for several days ahead, if you don‚Äôt go to him for 10 days - death is assured.  So, you can not be late to take a turn to this diagnostic programmer, so you have to sleep regularly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ce1/270/54b/ce127054b1d2c63300b5e4bceedbdabc.jpg" alt="image"><br>  - And yet, this diagnostician - the programmer takes in the afternoon, and since there is no queue, in 20-30 minutes of siesta, he will edit the bugs in your life program and you will be awake all evening. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af2/f52/dc3/af2f52dc3c6fb02daa789723f6199b02.jpg" alt="image"><br>  - An hour before bedtime, you should not take active steps, especially looking at bright screens (put a flux program, it will yellow the screen in the morning and evening, which reduces the destruction of melatonin), <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/38b/9ed/bed/38b9edbed6971971fdea785537175ebd.jpg" alt="image"><br>  - Take a bath and at the end of the bath (or shower) - cool the water to 22-23 degrees, the body cools during sleep before falling asleep, and then you haknesh it in advance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6a5/55c/e81/6a555ce8111c4908bef394b9e7362be8.png" alt="image"><br>  - Drink coffee only up to 12 days, as further, it begins to affect the quality of sleep. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/51f/b47/5cf/51fb475cfe63a153c5f87b90d099b6fc.jpg" alt="image"><br>  - Sleep does not accumulate in the body, as well as vitamins, if you don‚Äôt die your sleep deficit within 3 days, it is recorded in your health book and will be affected by old age. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/21f/fbd/5b9/21ffbd5b9c0ba920515ccbb492a5aab1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  - The special services also shared with us how to fall asleep quickly: close your eyes, roll them up (natural position during sleep) and start thinking not with words, but with images, for example, imagine that you walk through the forest, fly in the sky, conquer space.  This excites that part of the cerebral cortex, which is located near the center of dreams.  And the verbal portion of the cerebral cortex is inhibited - which prevents sleep. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e45/0a4/272/e450a42727d78541dbca9696c7a48820.jpg" alt="image"><br>  - You need to wake up slowly, do slackings, do not check for at least 20 minutes - ‚Äúwhat's new‚Äù (and this is the name of the most modern illness-addiction, in which people become dependent on small portions of endorphin on funny jokes, likes, reposts and terrible news), to eat porridge in the morning - it clings to the walls of the stomach, and then the intestines, and you want to eat less before lunch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8ee/d3b/f6a/8eed3bf6a0931f3388aa3b3db1c9460d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  - You need to find time to work when you are on a high and do not ever take this time nonsense, it is always better to work at this time, and home-household nonsense to do at a time when your brain is already tired and incapable of smart actions.  Personally, when I run around, it helps to sleep 2 hours to 2 nights and then start doing things, then after 4 hours, sleep an hour again and again 4 hours of work.  The great ones practiced multiple sleep and my bracelet measures the pulse, says that, indeed, you gain more time for ‚Äúdeep sleep‚Äù than for a night's sleep.  But it is better to practice only during the rumors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/76e/04e/1d8/76e04e1d88e6f5a7b41285b0dad07326.jpg" alt="image"><br>  - Practice the system Pomodorro, Kurillo, Otvlekarlo, Skagullo, Obedohodillo, CollegoBoltarlo any system that distracts you during the day, at least every hour and makes you walk.  Professor Utkin, said that the human circulatory system at rest uses only one tenth of the vessels and only during physical activities all the vessels are thoroughly rinsed with blood for heartbeats more than 100 per minute.  Physical activity is the main prevention of cardiovascular diseases (and this is the cause of 50% of deaths today).  And now, as for Pomodorro, how does it work?  You sit down at the computer, begin to work avidly, enter the state of flow and work 4-5 hours without getting up.  The brain (= a lazy creature whose goal is to save fuel), understands that if you are engaged in business, you will most likely sit back and spend all your supplies.  Therefore, the cunning brain postpones your effective, but long gatherings using procrastination.  But if the brain knows that the gatherings have clear boundaries and are given rest, it is easier to concentrate on a short tomato in 25 minutes or a long (as I like) 52 minute tomato.  Deceive your brain - rest. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/807/64e/e1e/80764ee1ebf2da247af56bd6dbeb921a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  - Save your brain, you think that while reading the next ‚Äúnightmare-news‚Äù you are resting, in fact, you are wasting fuel.  You think that you are listening to the next conference while programming and you save time, in fact, you are wasting ‚Äúthat very fuel‚Äù.  Remember, it is better to work in silence without being distracted and turning off the chat, and then having a rest, than switching to various trifles like a switch all day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dc3/ddc/295/dc3ddc2950a82097ba89c2aebd99de97.jpg" alt="image"><br>  - Pofigizm help you sleep.  Think about all the problems flying to the future for 5 years ahead or even further, ask yourself, being a grandfather, will you worry that you had such a problem so many years ago and whether you should spoil your nerves and health, worrying about such a ‚ÄúMalipuska‚Äù " <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a41/c14/1ab/a41c141abb0ef6b0b953d72dd6dae709.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Well, in the end, about smart alarm clocks.  Those alarm clocks that wake up in a certain phase of sleep - yes they help, but from time to time they fail, especially when you get used to them.  Although the vibrating bracelet that listens to your body and only wakes up at the moment when you start to move, it is comfortable and does not wake your loved ones (if you don‚Äôt embrace at that time, that closest one, but so you risk losing your hand).  The best alarm clock, which, especially in winter, awakens awesomely - a clever lamp that flares up at a certain time and does so for an hour, imitating the dawn.  She burns all melatonin for this hour and you wake up hearty and without an alarm clock.  My best purchase of the year before last is a simple 220V light bulb, which is controlled by wi-fi, and it performs all the magic of morning awakenings.  My wife is happy too. <br><br>  All sleep, fast and effective, so that more time left for you to live.  Do not try to deceive the diagnostician-programmer, he writes all your absenteeism, punching holes in his punch cards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4f4/620/94e/4f462094e98b8ee2c861ef76e253a55e.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396657/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396657/</a></p>
