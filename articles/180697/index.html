  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why I do not believe in the domestic space - a view from the inside</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For several years I have been working as a programmer at one of the enterprises of Roscosmos - FSUE XXXXX and in this post I would like to share my impressions about this organization. <br><br>  The main problem of the domestic high-tech industries of the 90s was a general lack of funds.  With reference to the present, this problem is practically absent.  Salaries are paid, repairs are carried out, new expensive equipment is purchased and even sometimes licensed software.  At this positive points end. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Hello, we are looking for talents </h4><br>  It is no secret that state-owned enterprises lack young specialists, but what do enterprises do to solve this issue?  It so happened that I got to work here through an acquaintance, being a graduate student.  At the same time, I received quite an interesting task, the result of which is applied in practice.  Was it possible to get to this place honestly?  I think no.  This job simply wasn't on the list.  Whether the heads of departments do not send requests to the personnel department, or whether they dissolve without a trace. <br>  The personnel department is a set of aunts who can do, for example, the following things: <br><br>  1) To calculate the heat dissipation on the boards, take a specialist in building heat engineering. <br>  2) Send in-service training information to select specific courses, get selected courses and ... <s>PROFIT</s> enter into contracts for other courses.  Including those for which the senders did not have the necessary basic knowledge.

      Also, the personnel department suspects the existence of sites for job search, but for some reason it is squeamish about using them.  Therefore, vacancies can be found only on the site of the enterprise. <br>  The second way to get fresh blood is students.  Students come to practice by orders from above, and nobody cares that they may have nothing to occupy.  In my university, I had to report in some detail on the work done, there was a mini-defense, but this is rather the exception to the rule.  The result of the practice of many students - well-established days and all.  If a student walks one or two days a week, it is considered that he cannot be charged with anything, although, given the general inhibition of all processes in the enterprise, this is the optimal number of days to visit in order not to sleep at work.  Moreover, if the student is still given a task, and he kicks the bolts, then nothing can be done with it.  He was sent by agreement with the Institute.  Naturally, after serving the allotted time, the student dumps far and forever.  Students are paid depending on their abilities, but generally not enough. <br><br><h4>  Round worn, square roll </h4><br>  What do flash drives, mobile phones, guitars, and vinyl players have in common?  That's right, all this can not be carried to the territory of the enterprise, at least in bags.  Bags at the exit, and sometimes at the entrance, are inspected by a crowd of useless in the ordinary life of auntie guards.  At the same time on the car from the territory you can take anything.  Naturally, there is no talk about any Internet in the workplace; more precisely, I can‚Äôt imagine how much paper needs to be smeared for a connection to be made.  After connecting, they say they block USB ports.  Accordingly, even the authorities are sitting with 3g modems. <br>  Let's move closer to my immediate work.  I had to program the microcontrollers in the console, which would receive signals from the strapdown inertial unit (BIB) sensors and output them via USB to a computer, as well as write a program to receive information in the computer.  The first thing that surprised me was the absence of TK in any solid form - all in words, according to the complexity with the sudden changes in the project in the future.  The second is the absence of any standards for writing programs.  The result is that the three programmers in the same department have different IDEs, two of them writing in C ++, and the third in C #.  Interaction, writing a product by a team - no, they have not.  In the beginning, my software was worked out on the layout.  The model consisted of Millandra demo boards and a pair of their own.  Their fees were ordered on the side (much faster and more humane) - and this is in an enterprise with a huge production base.  The model was quite fit in the box from under the shoes.  Further, it was decided to use the same demo boards in the serial product, although 90% of the periphery was not used on them.  The rest of the boards were already made at the enterprise by mounted installation (!).  As a result, the console turned out the size of the system unit.  Inspecting the work of installers entrusted some feature to me, in the presence of installers their inspectors.  The next week, spent with a soldering iron and a tester, I hated.  Check the mounting and harnesses MGTF do not want to even wish the enemy.  Another oddity is loyalty to all sorts of crutches.  Two controllers work in the console, and instead of connecting them over the bus and making one USB output, each controller uses its own USB and the remote connects to the computer with two wires (yes, I am ashamed of that, but then I was puzzled by the writing of the diploma) .  The company's policy is that a computer is assigned to the console.  Those.  if, let's say, you need to move the console from one stand to another, the computer also drags along with it.  This is caused by the workflow system.  By the way, it‚Äôs almost as difficult to write a working program because of a pile of useless pieces of paper. <br><br><h4>  Wisdom or insanity? </h4><br>  Separately, it is worth noting the age of most employees, who are committed to seventy years.  Moreover, if half of these employees are quite adequate and have vast experience and knowledge, then the second half stupidly receives a salary, being unable to any meaningful activity well, or not having this activity itself.  Doing nothing for months is an absolutely normal phenomenon that does not confuse anyone.  We should also mention the "elders" in the heads.  So one of them believed that the functionality of the console mentioned above can only fit in a rack (cabinet on wheels).  The greatest idiocy differ chiefs of the military.  There is a tacit agreement: the military is not very strictly related to the received products, and then, having retired early, they become heads of scientific research institutes without having the necessary competence.  Often, such chiefs put a stick in the wheel of young talented professionals to stay in their warm place. <br><br><h4>  Nanotechnology </h4><br>  The most interesting thing is that Western BIBs contain a normal exchange device in themselves, immediately offering the consumer a normal output, for example, RS-232, and have significantly smaller sizes, while domestic ones have one unpalatable output, output per channel, which leads to kilograms cabling and specific architecture of the onboard computer.  In electronic devices, only domestic components can be used, although in the same Milandra processors, only a domestic housing is used, which leads to the enormous size of the devices being designed. <br><br>  I could describe the idiocy going on for quite a while, but still sum up. <br><br>  So, the main reasons why I do not believe in the domestic space: <br><br>  - Pest personnel policy; <br>  - Extremely low level of leadership, delaying the deadlines; <br>  - Bureaucracy and lack of responsibility; <br>  - The complete lack of competition in this area -&gt; parasitism on the Soviet legacy; <br>  - Lack of growth prospects for employees (in terms of salary); <br>  - Lack of domestic element base. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/180697/">https://habr.com/ru/post/180697/</a></p>
