I wonder if there are any features that differentiate companies using Salesforce from other companies?  Do you have any thoughts on who the Salesforce user is, using data from public sources?  This is a question that Mintigo is trying to answer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For <acronym>DNA</acronym> analysis (here we mean organizational culture - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_DNA">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_DNA</a> <sup>translator's note</sup> ) Mintigo used their own technology to find companies that use salesforce.  They went through the sites of millions of companies to find the code and technology that would indicate the use of salesforce.  In addition, social networks, job sites and other databases were ‚Äúsearched‚Äù to find a reasonably reliable way to determine if salesforce was being used.  Mintigo analyzed all the data and put the indicators into a model that allows you to predict whether salesforce is using or not. <br><br>  At the next stage of the analysis, researchers took a group of companies using salesforce and compared them with a group of companies that do not use salesforce.  The selected groups were compared for several thousand parameters, including: company demographic indicators, finance, organization structure, hiring policy, marketing and sales tactics, as well as technology deployment.

      Below are the results of the analysis. <br><br><h2>  Company size and industry </h2><br>  Salesforce is popular in many industries and at different company sizes.  Salesforce is most popular with medium-sized companies operating in the areas of software, business services or manufacturing.  A deeper analysis shows that 74% of companies using salesforce have an average revenue between $ 1 million and $ 50 million. 63% of companies belong to the software, business services and manufacturing industries. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a8c/e51/c5a/a8ce51c5af2b4bdc95c31ec596ee4cca.png"><br><br><h2>  Pardot is the second most popular </h2><br>  When analyzing the choice of tools for automating marketing, the researchers found a curious pattern.  For example, companies that use salesforce are 21 times more likely to have some kind of marketing automation platform.  The Pardot platform, from Salesforce, is in second place in popularity among saelsforce users, with an indicator of 19% <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f1e/7ce/228/f1e7ce2280cb4d708ed0dc96ba9a329b.png"><br><br>  Another interesting observation is that companies using salesforce pay special attention to sales and marketing - and are 4 times more likely to have a sales team or marketers.  87% of companies with salesforce have a sales team, compared to 24% for companies without a salesforce.  In addition, 71% of companies with salesforce have a staff of marketers, compared with 14% for companies not using salesforce - 5-fold gap. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/07a/6a9/585/07a6a958564642c2a2f7866498e4599b.png"><br><br>  In addition to sales and marketing, salesforce has a strong position among companies that have a customer service team.  51% of companies with salesforce have a dedicated customer service team, for comparison only 5%, companies without a salesforce have such a team - a 10-fold difference. <br><br>  The strong position of salesforce in the high-tech industry can be traced by looking at the structure of the organization.  Companies that use salesforce are 6 times more likely to have an IT department, 5 times more likely to have a team of programmers and engineers and 9 times more likely to have a team of testers. <br><br>  Finally, if you would like to work in a company using salesforce, experts analyzed the vacancies published on the Internet over the past year by companies with salesforce.  The results showed that the most popular position is Business Analyst, Adjail. Developer and Expert of Business Applications (which usually includes the administrator‚Äôs salesforce) <br><br><h2>  findings </h2><br>  A large amount of data in the network allows you to discover interesting facts about the DNA of current and potential customers.  Salesforce users are most often medium-sized companies engaged in technology, services, or manufacturing.  They probably use marketing automation applications and pay particular attention to sales and marketing.  This data is available online for countless technologies and companies.  If you are looking for your next customer, such information is not just interesting - it is priceless. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/244989/">https://habr.com/ru/post/244989/</a></p>
