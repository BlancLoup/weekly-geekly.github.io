However, no one thought indignant. <br>  Oh well, of course, all the fun happens before the election. <br><br>  Let's click on the ‚ÄúDraft Law‚Äù link and read the downloaded .doc file. <br><br>  Quote: <br><blockquote>  Article 2. Ob'kti opodatkuvannya: <br><br>  2.1.  Ob'ktam opodatkuvannya zborom —î: <br><br>  ... skipped ... <br><br>  2.1.6 service providers, by global measures, transferring data on the subject of security services, to the subscriber, by subscribing to the subscriber, pay for the charges, for the actual subscriber, for the subscriber, pay for the trafs, for the subscriber, for the subscriber, pay for the traffickers, for the actual subscriber, for the subscriber, pay for the traffickers —ñnsh—ñ doodatkov—ñ pay the subscriber for the Internet connection, in that the number of zostosuvannyam mobile phone link; <br></blockquote><br><br>  Free translation: <br><br><blockquote>  2.1. The objects of taxation are: <br><br>  the cost of services provided by the global networks of receiving and transmitting data (Internet) for connecting to a subscriber, from charging a subscription fee for the provided traffic, for the subscriber‚Äôs actual units of measurement of the amount of received or sent data, multiples of one byte, or for any other additional subscriber charges for use Internet, including using mobile communications; <br><br></blockquote><br><br>  And here begins blowing on the forums. <br>  Creating petitions: <a href="http://www.petition.org.ua/%3Faction%3Dview%26id%3D245027">www.petition.org.ua/?action=view&amp;id=245027</a> <br>  And so on and so forth. <br>  The main thing, of course, is to remember to write who and from which faction came up with this bill. <br><br>  Few people know, but all bills are moderated in a special expert department. <br>  The expert department just also exists in order that would be glad would not adopt unfortunate laws. <br>  Let's read the conclusion of the expert commission together. <br><br>  Click on the link "Visovkov Head Scientific Expert Management September 10, 2009". <br><br>  And pay attention to the date of publication of this very output. <br><br>  Quote: <br><blockquote>  2. The principle novelty of the project —î the proposition of development for the development of theatrical performance and the maths of the servants, is supposed to be done with least hesitations from the Internet (Dannet).  In the case of draft documents on the draft documents on the scrutiny of dozlnost_ spravlyannya zboru —ñz zanaznenih service.  Before that, the position of the zalazhenikh servants on the year is quite high, and the installation of the site before the price increase, especially, little, change the number of coristuvacs, especially little loss.  In addition, it is possible to use it in the same way. obtyazhuvat yy dobatkovim zborami that file. <br><br>  6. In accordance with clause 2.1.6, clause 2.1 of article 2 of the project, under the responsin.

In order to reach the norm, they will be able to do it on one subscriber, on the occasional basis, on the occasion of one subscription, for those who have received help, who will be able to do it all. <br></blockquote><br><br>  Free translation: <br><blockquote>  2. The principal novelty of the project is the proposal regarding the collection of fees for the development of theatrical art and cinematography from the services provided by the networks for receiving and transmitting data (the Internet).  In the documents submitted to the project there is no justification for the expediency of collecting a fee from these services.  In addition, the cost of these services today is quite high, and the installation of an additional fee will increase their cost, which is likely to reduce the number of users, especially the poor.  In addition, since the spread of Internet services contributes to raising the general information level of citizens, the ability to access various services that have been used throughout the world for a long time, in our opinion, it is more logical for the state to support the development of the Internet (especially in rural areas) rather than burden them with additional fees and taxes. <br><br>  6. According to sub-clause 2.1.6 of clause 2.1 of article 2 of the draft, the object of taxation is the cost of services provided by the ‚Äúglobal networks for receiving and transmitting data (Internet) to connect the subscriber, with charging the subscription fee for the traffic provided, for the actual units used by the subscriber or sent data, multiples of one byte, or for any other additional subscriber fees for using the Internet, including using mobile communication. ‚Äù  According to this provision, a fee is charged several times from one subscriber, in particular, in the case of connection and for the current volumes of services consumed, which will increase the cost of the corresponding services. <br></blockquote><br><br>  and there are 18 more points on other parts of the bill. <br><blockquote><pre> Uzagal'yuyuchyy visnovok: the bill will require preopratsyuvannya.

 Head Leader V.I.  Bordenyuk 
</pre><br></blockquote><br><br>  I think that without translation it is clear that the bill was sent for further consideration in September 2009. <br>  However, this did not prevent comrades from news agencies to start sowing panic among people. <br><br>  Conclusions, as they say, do it yourself. <br><br>  The information-political war is already here, on our favorite Internet. <br><br>  ZY: And yes, I do not in any way agitate BYuT or any other party / president. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78533/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78533/</a></p>
