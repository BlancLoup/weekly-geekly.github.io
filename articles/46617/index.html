And all this is due to IT-technologies.</b> <br><br>  30% - a lot.  Imagine, almost every third recipient of advertising calls the seller to find out how much it costs, specifies the characteristics, thinks about the purchase.  This is just a dream of any advertiser! <br><br>  Transpromo is already widely distributed in Europe, begins a victorious march through the USA and Japan.

      A miracle was born at the junction of three technologies: <br>  - mailing (Direct Mail), <br>  - print on demand (On Demand), <br>  - modern information technology, the ability to receive and analyze complex amounts of data. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><code>&nbsp;</code><br><br><h2>  Essence of transpromo </h2><br>  If you tilt IT, then transprom - this is just a print advertising on the receipt.  Slightly more advanced direct mail. <br><br>  And it would have remained just an advertisement on the receipt.  But now advertising is selected using sophisticated algorithms especially for you.  That is, if you are a fan of Nokia mobile phones, you come to advertise the new Nokia phone.  If you drive a Volvo, then you get a Volvo ad.  If you live in an area where a new ‚Äúshopping for the home‚Äù store has just been opened, then you will receive an advertisement for this particular store. <br><br>  What is the goal is exactly this - as much as possible to study your habits and interests, and give you what is closer and more interesting.  This is the secret of success. <br><code>&nbsp;</code><br><br><h2>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Print_On_Demand" title="Print on demand in the English wiki">Print On Demand</a> </h2><br>  I learned about transpromo technology at the exhibition-conference ‚Äú <a href="http://www.ondemandexpo.ru/" title="Exhibition-Conference &quot;On Demand Russia&quot;">On Demand Russia</a> ‚Äù.  The exhibition is dedicated to modern digital printing machines, which are able to issue small print runs, in quality and price arguing with offset. <br><br>  And still modern digital printing machines are capable of issuing huge circulations with individual information.  It is enough to create software that would form files based on databases.  At the exhibition, similar software was presented, and cost a little less than a small printing press. <br><br>  In the photo you see Carlo Biassoni, technical director of <a href="http://www.infoprintsolutionscompany.com/" title="Website of the Transpromo company InfoPrint Solution">InfoPrint Solution</a> , who talked about transpromo.  The drama of the frame turned out by chance, just the flash did not work. <br><br>  With the help of digital machines, you can print on your receipt exactly the advertisement that smart programs decided to assign to you. <br><code>&nbsp;</code><br><br><h2>  Transpromo and IT </h2><br>  Transpromo would not have become such a phenomenon if it were not for powerful information and analytical work.  Analysis, including phonetic, is by no means trivial.  Only through the ability to analyze and interpret data can achieve the goals that set itself a transromo. <br><br>  The introduction of transpromo is another step that shows how the IT industry is changing the world.  For the better. <br><br>  And, of course, the appearance of such services in Russia will create interesting jobs for programmers and other IT workers. <br><br><h2>  Benefits of Transpromo </h2><br>  The benefits are obvious.  What do you do with the advertising letter or leaflet that came to your inbox.  At best, you catch a glimpse and throw it away.  But more often just throw it away.  You will read and view the receipt. <br><br>  If at the bottom of the receipt you see something that already interests you, you will look at this advertisement more closely. <br><br>  In this case, which is very important, the advertiser does not pay for the placement of advertising on all receipts.  He only pays for a small portion of the clients he needs.  And savings, and efficiency! <br><code>&nbsp;</code><br><br><h4>  Transpromo and design </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a37/fad/db2/a37faddb2880223f9c416da0c5874dfd.jpg" alt="Receipt now, and promised by advertisers" align="left">  The creators of receipts are usually not up to design, not to usability.  As a result, accounts usually do not look particularly attractive. <br><br>  The organizers of advertising companies Transpromo take the responsibility to make everything beautiful and attractive.  They add color, they think about usability.  In the picture I scanned my receipt for rent, and next I put the sample provided at the exhibition.  As they say - feel the difference. <br><br>  One of the rules of transpromo: do not grind.  Do not try to shove a lot of things in advertising.  Do not give the entire range of cars - give one model, which with a high degree of probability will interest the client.  Do not write a lot of text - one slogan is enough, links to the site and one phone.  Everything.  Do not annoy a person.  Do not ship it.  Let him relax on advertising and get positive emotions from her. <br><code>&nbsp;</code><br><br><h2>  How is the information collected?  How do you know that I like Nokia? </h2><br>  This is the most difficult and hidden question.  During the conference about him all the time said in passing.  Most often this phrase sounded: <br><br>  - In our time, you know everything about your client. <br><br>  I asked this question to Carlo Biassoni after his report entitled ‚ÄúTranspromo is already a reality,‚Äù to which he was evasively informed that information could be gathered from various open sources. <br><br>  We managed to talk a little with Mikhail Buk (Mikhail Bucka), <a href="http://www.gmc.net/">GMC Software</a> Director for Central and Eastern Europe.  Mikhail's Russian was just as bad as my English, we talked briefly, with more gestures.  And here I was waited by one not big disappointment: <br>  - one of the main sources of information about the client is his credit history.  In the west, this is a common phenomenon; an honest taxpayer values ‚Äã‚Äãhis credit history very much.  And almost every person gives permission to the bank to transfer data on their credit history to other banks.  It is not difficult to get these bases at your disposal.  Especially if the transpromo is planned to be printed on the receipts of the credit account. <br><br>  In the credit history there are almost all customer purchases.  This immediately solves many questions. <br><br>  Official customer information can also be attributed to one or another target group: <br>  - age <br>  - place of work and position, <br>  - education and place of study, <br>  - place of residence, <br>  - marital status, <br>  - the amount of monthly payments on the loan, <br>  - the amount of income. <br><br>  And another source - his majesty the Internet.  According to your photo and email address, specially trained people are looking for you in social networks.  Find interests and preferences.  You are all on the hook! <br><code>&nbsp;</code><br><br><h2>  Perspectives of Transpromo in Russia </h2><br>  At the exhibition, the word transpromo was mentioned very often.  More often another word sounded: the letter ‚ÄúK‚Äù, denoting the global economic downturn.  Everything was said something like this: <br><br>  - It is clear that now there is a crisis, you can print 500 booklets and on the offset, you can hire a person for ‚Ç¨ 300.  But the crisis will pass, we must think about the future ... <br><br>  And now I will try to justify why in Russia the time for transpromo has not yet come: <br><br>  - Receipts are printed by bureaucratic institutions, which modern technologies will not allow themselves to take to themselves soon, <br>  - transpromo is, in fact, an advanced direct mail, which we have not yet taken root, advertisers will not peck, <br>  - the credit histories of our citizens are not affordable, we still have the main method of payment; <br>  - the creation of analytical departments is difficult and expensive.  It is within the power of our specialists, but the question of payback is still in the fog. <br><br>  Verdict: transpromo will come to Russia, but not in the near future. <br><br>  The author of the photo and text: Vadim Galkin.
