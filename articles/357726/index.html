Sewage and hot water, printing press and Internet, conveyor and price tag.  Hundreds of inventions are emerging right now that will turn our lives around.  But we live so fast and so accustomed to the frantic pace of progress that we do not notice these changes.  I feel sorry for them.  Therefore, I stopped for a bit of time and captured the changes in my life in five short stories about dropbox.  And then he ran to live on. <br><br><h4>  How dropbox makes telling the truth </h4><br>  In the middle of the day a colleague calls me to meet with a client.  And it turns out that I promised this client to prepare either an analysis of his problem, or alternative solutions.  And in my head on this topic - empty, as on the streets at 10 am on January 1.  Apparently they caught me on the run and pulled out a promise from me.  I have not come across this for a long time, just like a schoolboy.  And school thoughts go to their heads - let's say to him that <a name="habracut"></a>  Home file left.  I take a couple more steps and the next soap - oh well, hell, I have the same dropbox.  All files are always with me.  Goodbye school tricks. <br><br>  We talked well with the client, somehow we toured the topic with the document, and only then I realized that the client probably didn‚Äôt know about the dropbox, and the argument would be good for him.  What can not be said now about my friends and colleagues.

    <h4>  How dropbox helps to learn math </h4><br>  My wife and I outlined a daughter to go to math school.  And there as an entrance exam - the Olympiad.  I decided to study with my daughter regularly.  Suddenly, at the same time, I myself will wise up.  I walked thoroughly - I prepare a piece of paper with tasks for each lesson. <br><br>  As a programmer, though not a real one, I abhor repeated manual operations.  About the generator of examples on the oral account and the division in the column I will tell later.  And now about tasks.  Tasks are contained in wonderful books and consist not only of text, but also of pictures.  To rewrite tasks every time is silly and long.  Solving them by the book - destroys the beauty of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äúone day one piece of tasks.‚Äù What to do? <br><br>  I do that.  Fotka selected tasks on the smartphone, on which there is a dropbox.  Photos themselves appear in the dropbox on the computer, from where I drag them into the document with the task.  No extra action, fast and beautiful. <br><br><h4>  Habitual magic </h4><br>  On weekdays in the morning I work at home for an hour and a half, then I move to work.  Sometimes I work on a weekend on a laptop.  Not a minute of time I spend on somehow synchronizing my data.  Just turn on the computer and continue to work from the place where I finished on another computer.  I still wear a flash drive in my pocket just in case, but I can‚Äôt remember when it was needed the last time. <br><br><h4>  The most important ingredient </h4><br>  Free place in dropbox at work ended pretty quickly.  I didn‚Äôt want to pay any money and transferred some of the data to Google.Drive.  And it turned out that the stable operation of the cloud storage is not its inherent quality.  ‚ÄúWhy don't my files appear?‚Äù.  ‚ÄúDid you put the file?  Why don't I see him?  Okay, they went by mail ... ‚Äù.  The magic dissipated and we were left alone with ordinary computers, which should work well, but they do not always. <br><br>  Box.net, which came to replace Google.Drive, without a declaration of war and error messages, ceased to synchronize and began to work only after a restart.  Having read recently on Habr√© about how Yandex.Disk deletes user profiles, he sighed with relief.  Patience to try again and this product was not enough for me.  Apparently fortunately. <br><br>  After such adventures, I was filled with respect for the dropbox developers.  How much labor, talent, nerves and patience are needed for the product to work without failures.  On Mac, on Linux, on, I apologize, windows.  No restarts for months.  Like diesel Toyota LC70.  Like a Kalashnikov rifle. <br><br>  Magic happens when ordinary things work with absolute reliability.  Can you imagine if the stabilization system in the Segway would malfunction?  However, there was some video ... <br><br><h4>  How does dropbox solve problems you don‚Äôt think </h4><br>  After all our misadventures had to start all the same file server.  I connected the shared folder on it to the dropbox, solving the problem of access from outside.  But for a 100Gb account I had to fork out.  Everything finally worked, they do not send files by mail, they don‚Äôt carry them on flash drives.  There would be an end to the tale, but recently the director general amused me with a request to close the Excel file on my computer, because he doesn‚Äôt save it.  Well, you can live with it, although the magic is not the same. <br><br><h4>  Silent revolution </h4><br>  About five years ago I had a computer at work, a computer at home, a laptop and a smartphone.  Each of them had their own files.  To work with files at home, you had to copy them to a USB flash drive.  And then she could be forgotten at home. <br><br>  Now I have files in dropbox, mail in gmail and I have ceased to be tied to some computer.  At work, I sometimes sit down at someone else's computer and continue to work as if nothing had happened.  The revolution that freed my data occurred quietly and imperceptibly even for me.  Thank you, dropbox. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/357726/">https://habr.com/ru/post/357726/</a></p>
