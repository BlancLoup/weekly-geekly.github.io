      I would like to meet you, talk about our cloud and its capabilities. <br>  As well as inform about the promotion that will allow you to <b>save 50% of the cost of cloud hosting</b> . <br>  + for the Habra community, we are ready to issue test accounts, please contact! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>So who are we?</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a06/8e8/8cd/a068e88cd58fb6f8e65821e4343d3eba.jpg" alt="image"><br>  We are a company that provides a range of services for IaaS and SaaS models.  Our clients range from large legal entities to physicists. <img src="http://habr.habrastorage.org/post_images/330/ed7/08a/330ed708a1aa493498f25de98a59cf09.gif"><br>  Initially, our cloud was built and used for reliable storage and operation of company infrastructures.  Now large, and successfully developing usual corporate clients live in our clouds comfortably. <br>  For corporate clients, we provide services on the terms of payment for real consumption, coupled with post payment, and full compliance with SLA, we are confident in the quality of our service and therefore we offer such a model, that is, we are very interested in working well and they too.  These habits can also be interesting for Earth habrovans and if there are needs for advanced resources (memory from 32GB, processor power, disk arrays), feel free to write to lichku. <br><br>  Most of our employees left the system integration group of one major system integrator, with whom we are very closely and successfully friends to this day :) <br>  But this is most likely not so interesting in the context of Habr, since Habr is more a community of individuals and individually minded :). <br>  Why are you reading this now?  - Because we have grown to pull the clouds to the ground and therefore, perhaps you are interested. <br><br>  Now, the line of rendering services to individuals and the SMB segment, where reliability, openness and transparency of prices are at the forefront, is developing quite successfully.  We are not trying to discourage investment in half a year, the cloud business is a long investment.  We really look at the needs of the market, its prospects and reality, we derive the best solutions that are needed today and will be effective tomorrow without any extra costs for our Clients. <br>  We sell resources in which the Customer can be independently, easily and literally with one click, deployed the necessary virtual machines, virtual resources, virtual capacities with instantly scalable and real efficiency. <br><br>  <b>So what can we offer?</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.cloud4y.ru/cloud-resources/cloud-servers/cloud-servers.html">Detailed description of cloud hosting on the site.</a> <br><br>  <b>- The hardware platforms are the same as for demanding corporate customers.</b>  <b>Only an industrial approach to infrastructure.</b> <br><ul><li>  Huawei Blade Server (2CPU X5650 2660MHz, 64GB RAM, 4xEth1G, 2xFC4Gb) </li><li>  Extreme X460 Stack Switches (stackable configuration for resiliency) </li><li>  NetApp 3240A Data Storage System (DSS) - SAS Disks (we can use SSD caching for particularly demanding ones) </li></ul><br><br>  <b>- Xen (possibly VMware for corporate clients)</b> <br><ul><li>  As the most stable and proven free platform </li><li>  Fast automatic migration of any systems in case of physical equipment failures </li><li>  Guaranteed resources and lack of oversail </li><li>  Availability of a large number of pre-configured templates for Windows and Linux systems. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>- Payment and Personal Account</b> <br><ul><li>  Convenient personal account, with the display of all statistics and the ability to configure and order services. </li><li>  Payment per day, month, half a year, year.  For six months, a year, special conditions apply, see below. </li><li>  At any time you can change the configuration, and it will happen instantly. </li><li>  Payment by card and bank transfer. </li><li>  MoneyBack.  At any time! </li></ul><br><br>  <b>- Control Panel.</b>  <b>Here a lot of interesting things, from the most distinctive:</b> <br><ul><li>  Instant deployment of new machines from 30 seconds to 3 minutes depending on the type of OS. </li><li>  Automatic backups.  The client can enable this option.  Backups are naturally located on another storage, they won't be lost;) and you can roll back to the automatically saved working solution at any time. </li><li>  In addition to automatic, you can use Backup and Restore "one click".  At any time, take a picture (it is possible on a running machine) and, if necessary, restore with one click </li><li>  Live change of resources.  You can change the number of CPUs and RAM, storage volumes without stopping.  If the OS type understands such additions, then this happens even without stopping. </li><li>  Firewall policies.  From the Control Panel, you can enable and disable ports, networks and access protocols to the virtual machine. </li><li>  White IP.  You can set your list of IPs from which only you will have access to the Control Panel </li><li>  Statistics.  Graphs and detailed graphics on the CPU, network and drives. </li><li>  Cost statistics by the hour (when you pay by fact of consumption) </li><li>  You can quickly increase or decrease the size of the disk with automatic correct resizing of the file system in the OS </li><li>  API.  Full management of your resources </li><li>  Custom templates.  You can create a template by using any of your machines and then use it for quick deployment. </li><li>  Template Library  Very large selection of operating systems and applications pre-configured.  <a href="http://www.cloud4y.ru/cloud-resources/cloud-servers/templates.html">Read more ...</a> </li><li>  KVM (Console).  The graphical console right in the browser, you can see the status of the machine in any state. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>And now in our opinion from the most interesting (and this is in a couple of clicks directly from the Control Panel):</b> <br><br>  <b>Virtual machine autoscaling</b> <br>  You yourself set the rules for processing expansion and reducing consumption.  Your virtual machine will automatically upgrade to perform demanding tasks and even, according to the policy you set, can make downgrade to save your money. <br><br>  <b>Loadbalancer clustering</b> <br>  You simply specify the port by which you want to balance your list of virtual machines and the balancer itself monitors the load distribution and viability of the machines (if one machine does not respond to it, requests will not be received and traffic will be distributed to other machines).  Loadbalancer Clustering will not allow overloading (according to the load) any of the cluster machines and the cluster as a whole.  Such a performance guard will always ensure the maximum power of your cluster system. <br><br>  <b>Loadbalancer Autoscaling</b> <br>  We think this is the most delicious.  This is the same as Loadbalancer Cluster but with rules for expanding and reducing load.  You simply set a pre-configured template and as the load increases, the required number of new virtual servers are deployed, which are automatically included in the balancing cluster, and when the load decreases, they are deleted (if you wish).  This gives a very strong saving effect for projects with large load peaks, so for our clients (the developers of the popular Odnoklassniki game) we were able to improve performance and at the same time save money compared to their old infrastructure, with minimal changes in the application architecture. <br><br>  <b>iPhone and iPad</b> <br>  For lovers of Apple products, we have a client for these devices that will allow you to manage the cloud anytime, anywhere. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/443/96f/bfd/44396fbfdba9564bfd649d5a1dd1ef1f.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, something like this ) <br><br>  <b>And now more about the action, but it is very interesting:</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/656/6b9/21b/6566b921b2d914fa985a2e0d35c7e171.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>- 25%</b> if paid for half a year <br>  <b>- 50%</b> if paid for a year <br><br>  The action is scheduled to be held within 2 months. <br><br>  For more information about our <a href="http://www.cloud4y.ru/">cloud hosting on our website</a> . <br><br>  Yes, as we said earlier, for the Habr community, we are ready to issue test accounts (which are easy to convert to work), please contact <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/cloud4y/" class="user_link">Cloud4Y</a> ! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128243/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128243/</a></p>
