      E-mail marketing, as part of e-marketing, is used to increase website traffic and sales support.  Newsletter is now a modern, cheap and popular marketing tool. <br><br><h2>  Purpose and Methodology </h2><br>  The main purpose of the article is to emphasize the importance and effectiveness of e-mail marketing and e-mail newsletters in terms of electronic commerce.  To achieve the objectives of the article, an analysis was made of the main elements necessary for the implementation of marketing activities on the Internet. <br><br>  The secondary goal is recommendations for the implementation and evaluation of the success of marketing campaigns by e-mail. <br><br>  Technology eye tracking - allows you to track and record the movement of the user's gaze on the website, through specialized glasses. <br><br>  To achieve these goals, scientifically conducted multiple experiments testing users using specialized glasses.  Participants were invited to review the 16 advertising emails on the content, structure and position of the template on the page. <br><br>  Testing took place in two stages: testing personal e-mail messages and the mail itself as a whole.  The results of the article are given at the end of this article. <br><br><h2>  Analysis </h2><br>  E-mail marketing is currently the most common form of direct marketing in the context of the Internet.  This is an inexpensive but effective form of contacting potential or existing customers. <br>  When planning a company email marketing, you should determine the nature of the email. <br><br>  When using E-mail marketing, you need to save several important indicators to preserve the image of the company.  The most important indicators are delivery speed, opening rate and clickthrough rate. <br><br><h3>  Newsletter </h3><br>  Distribution performs the following tasks: <br><br><ul><li>  reminds of the existence of the company; </li><li>  provides information to customers and potential customers; </li><li>  increases brand confidence; </li><li>  leads readers to order products or services; </li><li>  gets feedback. </li></ul><br>  It is important that E-mail newsletter contained useful information.  Otherwise, people may unsubscribe from the newsletter and people‚Äôs trust in the company or brand will decrease. <br><br>  Of great importance is also the design of the mailing list, size, content, semantics and creativity, as well as the time of sending. <br><br>  According to the Law on electronic communications, letters should be sent only to those users who have subscribed to the newsletter.  Otherwise, we are talking about spamming, which can lead to a fine. <br><br><h2>  EYE TRACKING results </h2><br>  An important factor in measuring the success of e-mail and all related marketing activities is the proper formation of the ultimate goal.  The best way to measure efficacy is to evaluate data statistics after a user transitions from a mailing list.  Significantly helps in data collection - Google Analytics and YaMetrika. <br><br>  These are services that track the statistics of the pages viewed: the time spent on the site, the ignore factor, the number of conversions and the revenue generated from clicks. <br><br>  Based on the previous results of the experiment on eye tracking e-mail users, it was determined which parts of the letter should be given special attention when writing it. <br><br>  Eye tracking technology was used to demonstrate the importance of the subject of the letter for the initial conversion. <br><br>  In most cases, respondents fixed their gaze on the first three words of the title line.  It was later analyzed whether all respondents read the message in full, as well as its preliminary title. <br><br>  Most respondents read the first four words of the text. <br><br>  The words on which they focused their attention: something is missing, a trend, a special action, a large collection, today is the last day, free delivery, tested products. <br><br>  Based on the test results, an area of ‚Äã‚Äãinterest was identified, where respondents spent most of the time or which parts of the message were seen primarily after opening the email. <br><br>  Based on the results of the experiment, the main architectural elements of advertising letters were highlighted: the title, introduction section, the main advertising section, which contains the section and the footer. <br><br><h2>  Cases </h2><br><h3>  1 Case </h3><br>  Consider a specific situation on the example of various companies, namely, email-case from Lexus. <br><br>  It is not efficient to sell lux class cars through email marketing, but Lexus decided to tell about the features of the new crossover using email to its customers. <br>  Marketers decided to use the technology of Agile Mail - with its help, content can be personalized at the time of opening the letter, and not at the time of sending.  To emphasize the features of the car, marketers decided to show that the crossover will cope with any weather conditions - snow, rain or ice.  Targeted letters displayed the weather version in accordance with the weather conditions of the subscriber at the time of opening the letter. <br><br><img src="http://blog.sendexpert.com/ru/files/articles/3/0/0/images/1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Result</b> <br><br>  Weather personalization has shown higher efficiency, as the degree of subscriber involvement has increased in comparison with the classical mailings of the same crossover. <br><br><ul><li>  CTR increased by 234% </li><li>  The number of page views - by 26%, </li><li>  Time spent on the site - by 18%. </li></ul><br><h3>  2 Case </h3><br>  Next, we consider the case on the example of the online store ‚ÄúAromabutik‚Äù: how to reanimate subscribers using flash-sale. <br><br>  In order to return inactive subscribers to purchases, the online store Aromabutik sent after 6 months a letter with a proposal to resume purchases, and as a bonus gave a small discount. <br><br>  The letter had a good record of opening letters (OpenRate-56%) and clickability (CTR-22%).  However, the purpose of the mailing was to increase the conversion, which was not achieved and it still had a very low rate (2.1%).  Therefore, it was decided to launch a sale to revive subscribers and get rid of hopelessly lost contacts. <br><br>  After segmentation, 30% of all subscribers were reached, and flash-sale was sent to them.  It is a classic sale only for subscribers with a very limited period - sometimes a few days, sometimes a few hours. <br><br>  What needs to be done to make your flash sale successful? <br><br><ul><li>  Analysis of openability (determine the duration of the action and analyze the reaction of subscribers; for Aromabutika, the validity period was 48 hours. </li><li>  Technical preparation (prepare the server for a possible jump in the flow of customers, prepare managers for working with a large number of orders). </li><li>  Base Assessment (assess client base activity, conduct mailing in several stages in order not to get into spam). </li><li>  Announcement of flash-sale (letter with a countdown timer to the sale). </li></ul><br><img src="http://blog.sendexpert.com/ru/files/articles/3/0/2/images/2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The company carried out the mailing in several stages, sending three letters in a few days, the results of the final mailing are displayed below: <br><br>  Mailing results: <br><br><ul><li>  OR = 14.8% </li><li>  CTR = 20.5% </li><li>  Conversion = 4% </li></ul><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> : the chain of sending letters showed a high result, since 6% of subscribers completed the conversion, and 3% of subscribers became regular loyal customers of the online store ‚ÄúAromabutik‚Äù. <br><br><h2>  Effective techniques in email marketing </h2><br><br>  After analyzing a lot of case studies on this topic, we determined for ourselves that there are some approaches in mailings that are guaranteed to attract customers.  We will describe some of them in detail. <br><br><ol><li>  <i>Agilemail</i> - personalized newsletter.  Provides subscribers with relevant information that they need here and now, ‚Äùadapts the letter depending on the context of the opening. </li><li>  <i>Flash sale</i> .  The distribution method is most suitable for online stores, where in several stages of sending letters, the client will be informed about the start of any short-term action, with an individual approach specifically to it. </li><li>  <i>Poll</i>  It is only necessary to add a survey form to the text of the letter.  This element of the letter not only the company to clarify the portrait of the subscriber, but also introduces an interactive element in the letter, which is very popular with users. </li><li>  <i>Distribution in several stages</i> - a suitable method for infobusiness (acquaintance, customer problem, valuable content, problem solving ability, gift of unique content). </li></ol><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  E-mail marketing has long been considered not an effective channel for attracting traffic, and customers - not an appropriate form of communication.  Currently, its status has changed, and E-mail marketing is considered one of the most effective marketing activities related to brand promotion, improving customer relations and getting new customers. <cut></cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/344242/">https://habr.com/ru/post/344242/</a></p>
