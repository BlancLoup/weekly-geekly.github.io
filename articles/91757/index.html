The names of the lucky ones and their merits are worthy of announcement, as well as information about the new competition. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f31/716/871/f31716871684b0a6983696f333d7babd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  All-all-all under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The contest of useful ideas <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/86102/">began</a> in March - it was a surprisingly simple task.  To get the desired SSD-drive, it was necessary to think of absolutely any idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan application for mobile devices based on the <b>Intel Atom processor</b> - no difference, be it a netbook or overseas MID.  Even more surprised that the applications (ideas) were sent not so much - only 46 pieces.  But, let's not hide it - it was a pleasure to work even with so many works, because  almost every one of them was interesting in its own way.  Here are the most-most, in our opinion, from the submitted works:

You can, of course, write a magical * .bat file, but why not make this useful and pleasant trifle for everyone? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dc5/18d/a5e/dc518da5e623d076539d5862fa62e329.png" alt="image">  <b>The third winner</b> is <b><a href="http://labinskiy.habrahabr.ru/">Labinskiy</a></b> : <br><br>  ‚Äú <i>Now, most mobile devices have not one, but several ways of accessing the network.</i>  <i>Be it GPRS / EDGE / 3G, Wi-Fi or WiMax, and maybe something else.</i>  <i>What I lack in mobile devices is the very mobility.</i>  <i>Yes, they certainly are not tied with an Ethernet cable to the outlet, but as you move around the city, the signal level is constantly changing.</i>  <i>I want the device in the background to interrogate all interfaces to the signal level and, when a more suitable connection appears, would display an unobtrusive icon in the notification area with the ability to change the connection.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Continuing the idea, I would like to be able to set priorities - speed or cost.</i>  <i>So, at the same time a home Wi-Fi access point with unlimited, but at the same time completely clogged channel torrents can be available and, at the same time, a stable signal from a WiMAX tower can be available but, for example, with payment for traffic.</i>  <i>Depending on the priority chosen, either a free connection or a paid connection should be offered, but with a higher signal speed / quality.</i>  <i>To do this, the connection manager for each of the networks must be able to set the cost of the work, while the device can determine the access speed independently.</i>  <i>By the way, it goes without saying that if we have several Wi-Fi access points or any other connections with the same cost, we should offer the connection with the highest speed</i> ‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e11/be6/c0a/e11be6c0a1d3e614a345b2231f405bea.png" alt="image">  Such an application is useful to really active users or just owners of technically clever machines.
