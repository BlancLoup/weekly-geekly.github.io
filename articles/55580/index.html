  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Win QIWI</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Here mine already wrote about the UI of these machines.  And yesterday I had to face him.  And fight. <br>  It seems that the usability was tested only on cellular payments. <br>  Next is just a "cry of the soul" ... <br><br>  I had to pay a loan to Alfa Bank.  We don‚Äôt have their ATM in the city, and there is no representation either.  You can through the mail, but for a long time.  I called the bank, they told me that it was possible to do this through the QIWI payment system. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To do this, I found the nearest QIWI terminal and got My Personal Account in it. <br><br>  After that I found in the menu ‚ÄúPay credit‚Äù, filling in the requested data. <br>  Among the requested data was a card number;  the expiration date of its action;  my date of birth;  city ‚Äã‚Äãof birth;  FULL NAME. <br>  Notice how much unnecessary data, and all of them need to enter from the on-screen keyboard. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Then I chose to ‚Äúreplenish the card account‚Äù (as an option I tried to choose ‚Äúpay the loan‚Äù) - to which the system answered ‚Äúthe wrong number was entered‚Äù.  Literally, the text of the error can not remember, but with the context of the payment of the loan, he did not fit. <br><br>  Thinking that the machine probably fail, I went to look for another.  Having repeated the same operation there five times, I still <br>  called the support service.  Responded quickly.  Explained that you need to first deposit money into the account.  I needed to pay a little more than 1000 rubles. <br><br>  Mentally slapping himself on the forehead came up, replenished the account LC.  Repeated the whole procedure for the 6th time and ... AGAIN THE SAME ERROR. <br><br>  While I was calling for technical support, I was thrown out of the session of working with the LC.  I had to repeat the whole procedure again.  To dictate the error message to the girl. <br>  Unfortunately, she could not help me.  I asked to check the data and call back.  Checked once again.  It does not fit ... and they cannot help me pay the loan. <br><br>  To the question ‚Äúwhat should I do now?  I need this thousand to pay the loan today "offered to withdraw this money to myself through the CONTACT system ... only bad luck .... Commission for withdrawal through CONTACT - 75r ... Well, time ... not a fact that I would get the money before the time when the mail closes . <br><br>  He spat, went, found more money, paid off the loan in the old manner, through a slow, but still reliable Russian Post. <br><br>  However, the story is not over ... Chukchi thought he was smart, and went to the site <a href="http://qiwi.ru/">qiwi.ru</a> <br>  There he logged into his LC, and tried to pay the loan again through him. <br><br>  Entered the same billing data. <br>  Failed to fill only one field. <br><img src="http://img136.imageshack.us/img136/4476/qiwi.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  It is circled in red. <br>  According to the inscription, it seems that the field is optional, but without it the system does not accept the form. <br>  When you try to fill it does not allow to enter there more than 4 characters.  And as I understand it, you must enter the date from the 10/11 card.  At least on the terminal there was a similar field. <br>  The "slash" / enter also does not.  And it is not clear where to enter it if only 4 characters are allowed in the field. <br><br>  I thought that maybe Java script in the browser is buggy.  I tried different browsers ... IExplorer 8, Firefox 3.0.7, Chrome 0.1.x, Opera 10 - it doesn't work the same everywhere. <br><br>  Here I sit and think ... how was it possible to design the interface of the machine, and the site, so that the person would spend half a day to pay for the necessary service through it, talk to tech support, try to do the same thing through the site, pops up, and write a detailed letter to the technical support ( which by the way is still no answer) ... <br><br>  And today, based on that letter, make a publication for Habr. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/55580/">https://habr.com/ru/post/55580/</a></p>
