      On the heels of a new presentation, I asked to write a detailed story about what has changed. <br><br>  In short, much has changed.  In this post I will write about new end-user features, and in the next, about changes for developers (which, by the way, are also important for the end user). <br><br>  So.  All waited for a part of the changes.  A part - and did not hope.  In order of announcement: <br><ul><li>  Long-awaited cut / copy / paste.  Apple has spent a lot of effort on licking this interface, which is not very easy to implement on a touchscreen device.  In a word: it turned out.  Convenient, beautiful, works generally everywhere.  If you shake the iPhone - the insertion / cutting of the text will be canceled :) </li><li>  You can send more than one photo at a time by E-mail. </li><li>  In all major applications from Apple added landscape (landscape) mode and the corresponding keyboard.  Write letters, SMS, notes will become much more convenient. </li><li>  Manage individual SMS.  They can be deleted, they can be forwarded. </li><li>  Mms.  Send photos, audio notes, coordinates on the map, contacts. </li><li>  Actually, voice notes.  Dictaphone.  Rather advanced, with the ability to edit. </li><li>  Supports CalDav and ICS calendar subscriptions. </li><li>  Global search throughout the iPhone.  Made amazing!  Search in letters, music, video, SMS, MMS, anything.  Very fast and easy access to search.  Called Spotlight :) </li><li>  A2DP support.  Simply put - support for stereo headsets via bluetooth.  Even easier - support for full-fledged wireless headphones. </li><li>  Sync notes </li><li>  Wi-fi autologin. </li><li>  Autocomplete Safari Fields </li><li>  Normal call log </li><li>  Encrypted Profiles </li><li>  YouTube subscription </li><li>  LDAP support </li><li>  Live streaming audio and video support </li><li>  Creating invitations to calendar appointments </li></ul><br><br>  A lot of pictures can be viewed here: <a href="http://live.gdgt.com/2009/03/17/live-iphone-os-3-0-event-coverage/">live.gdgt.com/2009/03/17/live-iphone-os-3-0-event-coverage/#more-300</a> <br><br>  All this will be available to users this summer - for free. <br><br>  But much more abruptly the other - that will be allowed to developers. <br><br>  From this side everything is much more interesting.  Apple allowed the developers something that no one and did not hope.  And it will be incredibly interesting to look at the software that will be created by the summer. <br><br>  In order of announcement: <br><ul><li>  New payment methods: monthly subscription, in-app purchases.  Now the application itself can take money from users.  There are many use cases: a book reader application that sells books.  Multiplayer games where you can buy items.  In the end, a poker club where you can use money from your iTunes account to play poker. </li><li>  Support peer to peer connections.  Speaking in a simple way, you can now make multiplayer games, for games that do not need to have a wi-fi router or something.  Normal bluetooth, and with absolutely automatic finding of other people around.  But, of course, this is not only about games - giving each other contacts, photos, playing together musical instruments, in general - sharing any information. </li><li>  A very big thing: open access to accessories.  Let's say you produce external speakers for the iPhone.  You can write an application with a beautiful equalizer.  Another example is an accessory for measuring blood glucose levels.  The third is an FM receiver with a clever software interface.  And so on. </li><li>  Ability to embed Google maps in your applications.  You can put your own data on top. </li><li>  The ability to implement a GPS navigator.  Unfortunately, not on Google maps - they do not license them for such navigation. </li><li>  Long-awaited push-notifications.  Your servers can report events to the user.  This may be a notification of new ICQ-messages.  A message about how a football game is going.  Post a new message to classmates.  And this is without launching the corresponding programs.  You just listen to the music and get all these alerts exactly when the relevant events occur (and not every 2, 5 or 10 minutes) </li></ul><br>  Also, <b>hundreds of</b> different SDKs have been added, about which no single word has been said.  But the list (not complete) is shown.  The most interesting: <br><ul><li>  API for working with the battery </li><li>  Work with E-mail in your application </li><li>  Access to distance sensor </li><li>  Streaming audio / video </li><li>  Shake API </li><li>  Many APIs for working with interfaces: toolbars, text selection, alerts, etc. </li><li>  And apparently, still very, very much more </li></ul><br><br>  The presentation showed applications created by developers at the request of Apple for two weeks.  A full-fledged 3D shooter that works over the Internet, Sims3 with buying junk for money, playing a trombone as a duet, a very sophisticated program for diabetics with an accessory that measures blood glucose, a program that keeps you up to date on football matches with the ability to instantly see interesting moments on video.  And so on. <br><br>  Bottom line: in place of the developers of Windows Mobile, Android, and other mobile platforms ‚Äî I would first fall into depression, and then retrain from handhelds to all kinds of subnotes and the like.  WM-smartphones will have no future.  Android does not have it yet.  In Symbian - no longer.  Maybe Android will have something on a few other devices.  WM can be buried.  Yes already. <br><br>  Considering the unity of the world of developers for Apple, accessories manufacturers, ease of software implementation, unity of the platform ... given a million more different advantages of development for iPhone OS - professional development for other platforms loses the last share of appeal. <br><br>  Apple needs to take the last step: to radically update the AppStore (premium sections, more serious opportunities to promote their products, a good mechanism for trial applications) and release new iPhone models, preferably, slightly expanding the line.  I'm sure something like this will be done during this year. <br><br>  Most of all, I regret now that I am not programming for the iPhone, but it‚Äôs lazy to start.  But in the current project and all the projects that I will manage in the future, the iPhone platform will receive very close attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/54775/">https://habr.com/ru/post/54775/</a></p>
