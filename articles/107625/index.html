And this reader, i.e.  you (yes, do not turn your eyes away from the letters, it is you) that you have heard a long time ago that your business is cool.  And, maybe, there was just not enough light kick to get out of the zone of everyday comfort and something, but to undertake. <br><br>  This article is addressed to those who are already "on the verge."  It is almost devoid of philosophy and hazy links, just stupidly tudu list.  Take it and do it.  I deliberately save you from explaining why a young project needs state registration, is it really such a freedom to be an owner and from where to get money for state duty.  The article is addressed to Moscow startups, geo-patches from other cities are welcome in the comments. <br>  We will assume that we have decided on the form of ownership - this is LLC and a simplified 6%.  If anyone needs an IP - it's easier there, you can handle it without this article.

Often they can give and just yradres "only for tax", but I did not tell you this and did not advise, do we all comply with the laws ?;  o) At this stage they don‚Äôt have to pay anything, but ask for a letter of guarantee for your non-existent LLC ‚Äú% Company%‚Äù LLC about the provision of premises after state registration.  Stamps, signatures and power of attorney are welcome, with a copy of the documents of ownership of the specified working area.  If the papers are not given, go to the next business center (business center), there are a lot of them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bfd/993/624/bfd993624b6524f0b4172caf17658a27.gif" alt="Caps">  <b>Choose a bank under the CSC</b> <br>  Now look at the map next to you banks.  Looking for offices to work with legal entities.  Among the banks we look at the service "Doing RKO".  CSC is a cash settlement service, i.e.  keeping your% username% account.  You need to choose based on three parameters: <br>  o affinity of the branch to you <br>  o prices for such a service <br>  o bank reliability <br>  On the price, you can not get too hung up, because if things go well, for a company the difference of 10-100 bucks will quickly become a penny a month, and if things go bad, then why are you in business?  Then press <u>RESET</u> and think over new ideas for business. <br>  I chose Alfa-Bank according to the following criteria: it is located on my metro line, there are no officials and state bodies in the shares of the bank owners, and among the banks without government participation is number 1 (number 6 in the general list).  Many recommend Sberbank, but they have slowed down and crooked Internet banking.  For some reason, they cursed VTB24, but they didn‚Äôt say what exactly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bfd/993/624/bfd993624b6524f0b4172caf17658a27.gif" alt="Caps">  We take 4400r., We print and we fill two <b>receipts for payment of the state duty</b> at home <b>, and we stamp in the nearest Sberbank</b> .

It is necessary to open them as much as possible within the framework of a reasonable one, so that later not to redo the charter ten times.  OKVEDI can be compared with the list of skills in the character in Fallout.  For example, for an IT office, <a href="http://eland.ru/habr/ooo/okvedlist.txt">such a list</a> will come down.

In the bank to stomp better in the morning. <br>  There you will be asked a bunch of stupid questions about the average annual turnover, the TIN of counterparties, the number of employees and something else for ignoring the importance and honor of their security services.  Be sure to tell me that you are an IT person and you want to have access to Internet banking.  And they will also force you to put samples of print impressions and sign a bunch of contracts and attachments to it.  Request a copy of the signature sample MANDATORY, because then the whole brain will be brought to you if you have a squiggle in the wrong direction.  Believe me, your signature is the hardest to fake: o (You‚Äôll then work out at home by photocopy.

Why do you need someone?  This is so much potential hemorrhoids.  First, everywhere you will be ‚Äúwe walk with Tamara as a pair‚Äù, everywhere for signatures, for taking the Charter for tax purposes and so on, messing with powers of attorney.  And if, all of a sudden, it is a matter of disagreement, it‚Äôs also a showdown for someone who is cutting how much money.  Where it is possible - it is better to be 100% owner, then, all the same, some will have to be given to investors or shareholders.  Where it is quite difficult without crutches - it is important that someone has more than one percent.  For example, 51% + 49%, or 34% + 33% + 33%, in general, someone should always be more important.

Those who decide - <b>good luck</b> . <br><br>  ================================================= ================ <br>  Fresh feedback from the application of the leaflet to practice from <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/andriyan/" class="user_link">andriyan</a> : <blockquote>  In the process of applying some clarification. <br><br>  There are a lot of notaries in Moscow, but we did not manage to find a notary certifying a set of documents for 500 rubles.  Although, of course, they did not ring everyone - but those with whom they spoke, asked for at least 1,000 rubles.  A large nest of notaries was found in Bobrov Lane, and they did it there. <br><br>  The authorized capital can be contributed by property (for example, a computer), and you need to change the form of the Solution. <br><br>  You can register in Moscow at your home address (from practitioners - the founder, from theory - the director). <br><br>  The receipt for the registration application is not necessary to print, it is done in the IFTS ‚Ññ46. <br><br>  The final set of documents for IFNS ‚Ññ46: <br>  1. The <b>Charter of LLC</b> (original stitched and its copy - the second original is not taken!). <br>  2. Application for a certified copy of the Charter. <br>  3. The decision to establish an LLC or Minutes of the general meeting of participants. <br>  4. Agreement on the establishment of an LLC (if there are several founders). <br>  5. <b>Application for state registration</b> (form No. 11001, certified by a notary).  It must be carefully checked before the notary with the Charter - we inadvertently incorrectly wrote the full and abbreviated names (without quotes), should be exactly as in the Charter.  The notary does not check this! <br>  6. Certificate of opening a savings bank account (if the authorized capital is formed in cash). <br>  7. A document confirming the legal address (letter of guarantee, lease agreement).  The specified document is not specified in the current legislation as mandatory, however, the tax registration authorities require it.  This requirement, apparently, can be challenged in court - but it takes time. <br>  8. Receipt of payment of registration fee. <br>  9. Receipt of payment of state duty for the certification of the second copy of the Charter. <br>  10. Application for use of the simplified tax system in duplicate <br>  11. Applicant's passport. <br><br>  If you do not glue a piece of paper, but sculpt a self-adhesive sticker of sufficient size and tackiness (as some notaries do) - there is a chance to make corrections to the stitched set of documents without a second campaign to the notary.  We made it. <br><br>  Registration of legal entities is open from <b>7</b> to <b>20:45</b> , and the PI - from 9 to 18. <br><br>  On Wednesday, November 24 at 19:00 there was not a single person (although it was raining heavily).  At 8:45 on Thursday, we managed to make two visits in an hour and a half. <br><br>  <b>For registration of</b> individual entrepreneurs (individual entrepreneur) this <a href="http://ip-nalog.ru/registratsiya-ip.html">link</a> was very useful <a href="http://ip-nalog.ru/registratsiya-ip.html">: Registration of</a> individual entrepreneurs, many thanks to its authors. </blockquote>  Thank you so much for feedback. <br>  <i>At the expense of a <a href="http://maps.yandex.ru/-/CVRamac">notary for 500r.</a></i>  <i>- m. Semenovskaya, we turn to the left, on the street.</i>  <i>Shcherbakovskaya, and go straight.</i>  <i>After 500 meters there will be an entrance.</i>  <i>Inside the room we go to the end of the corridor.</i>  <i>Conveniently, Rosstat is also located nearby.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/107625/">https://habr.com/ru/post/107625/</a></p>
