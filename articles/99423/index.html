  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pissing off 2.0</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The project <a href="http://bablorub.blogspot.com/2010/04/blog-post_4086.html">started</a> on April 21 - a week before my birthday.  The idea, as some may seem, was not spontaneous, but rather long postponed.  Since last autumn I wanted to make such a project, but I did not find any internal forces for programming.  He even tried to fool an idea to someone, but the person did not do it.  Therefore, hands, head and desire coincided only at the end of April 2010. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At first glance, a nondescript request "free toilets" collects 15 thousand.  appeals in Yandex.  Therefore, it was worth working with him, at least for the sake of experiment.  Secondly, there was some kind of unclaimed zest in this topic, albeit with a brown tint. <br><br>  As the engine was taken development for <a href="http://paky.ru/">Pakuryu</a> .  Cut voting and added <a href="http://classifiers.ru/">directory of</a> regions and cities.  So the programming itself took about two hours.  And as always, most of the time was spent on technical delays while the scripts and the database were uploaded to the server. <br><br>  As a primary, I asked a few friends to fill for their city.  But they did not, however, one advised to take the McDonald's network as a basis.  What I did.  I took the poppy site and stupidly perekopipastil several dozen restaurants. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      However, in parallel with the filling process of promotion went.  There was a topic in the club.  Then I threw a message in ICQ on my contact list (1000+ people).  At the next stage - a blog and a forum.  On the topic, Kalinin picked up the topic and made a flip on <a href="http://dirty.ru/">dirty.ru</a> (first throw there). <br><br>  A little earlier, we managed to negotiate with a blogger and Bigdan for 50 bucks.  And he made a message about the project sponsor of one of his contests.  Here are two of these events (Dirti and Ibigdan) and predetermined the primary explosive growth in the popularity of the project.  The brown zest fell in love with the users, and they began to fill the project.  At that time, every minute on the site appeared a new toilet.  And the total attendance approached 2 thousand.  per day.  A little, but the topic, you see, is specific. <br><br>  In parallel, I made two letters without any hope.  One is Artemia, and the second is Fritz Morgen.  Morgen answered me (‚Äúa good project‚Äù), and Artemy kept silent.  Since the link did not follow, I forgot to think about these letters - but in vain. <br><br>  The second stuffing was already a month later: June 2.  Someone from grateful users again posted an announcement on the Dirty.  And somehow the project came into view of the web.rambler.ru review site.  Here was a real breakthrough.  The echo is well and boldly spread around the Internet. <br><br>  On June 27, the project got on display at the First Alternative.  It is nice to be on TV, but in reality it brought mostly a lot of visits from the search by project name, and about 500-600 of everything happened in the first 24 hours and about half as many in the second. <br><br>  And on June 29, I woke up famous.  The project got to Lebedev in the review and it gave only about 8.5k transitions from his blog.  And another half was the echo effect.  In total, Lebedev‚Äôs link gave the project approximately 200-300 new toilets and brought the total to 1200+. <br><br>  Having decided that that's all, I honestly nobly scored on the project, ceasing to monitor it.  And I missed the announcement from Fritz Morgen on July 14, if I'm not mistaken.  This increased the total attendance by 1.5k on that day. <br><br>  Some summary of incoming traffic: <br><br>  Blogs <br>  - ibigdan - 0.5k <br>  - my blog - 0.5k <br>  - Lebedev - 8.8k <br>  - Fritz Morgen - 0.4k <br><br>  Social networks <br>  - twitter - 0.5k <br>  - LJ community - 0.5k <br>  - contact - 1k <br>  - LJ total (with Lebedev and his ilk) - 12.8k <br><br>  Social news <br>  - dirti - 4k <br>  - web.rambler.ru - 5.3k <br><br>  Search engines <br>  - google (+ reader) - 2k <br>  - Yandex - 1k <br><br>  Dress <br>  - bookmarks - 21k <br>  - others (xs, what the lyre means by this) - 3.5k <br><br>  In total, the service for 3 incomplete months was visited by 44k uniks.  They looked at 150k pages, which is part of the standard interested user (the main one is the region - the city). <br><br>  The income from such a project is small, as you understand.  About two dozen bucks in adsense.  But not for his sake everything was done.  It was just a very interesting experience.  I know that you still receive links to the project from friends who have not yet seen the site.  And it is nice.  By the way, most of all delivers read comments to the project. <br><br>  A reference to the project itself: <a href="http://obossus.ru/">obossus.ru</a> . <br><br>  UPD.  I am sure that a considerable share of success is a successfully chosen domain.  So thanks to me for not joining in and not registering something neutral, but taking the simplest and most common word by which we denote our desire. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99423/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99423/</a></p>
