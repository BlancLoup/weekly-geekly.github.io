The history of BlogService is simple: I constantly helped with the creation of blogs and the resolution of technical problems to my friends, members of the mazoo networks and everyone who came to me for advice.  At some point, this ‚Äúsupport‚Äù became so much that I decided that it was time to take money for it.  So the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãBlogService appeared, and then he himself appeared.  Of course, you don‚Äôt collect money from your friends, but the service turned out to be in demand.  There were two employees in the newly formed company.  They are also co-owners.  One is a financial genius, the other is technical ... uh ... also not a fool.  And we have no competitors in runet yet.  It is much more interesting to cooperate so far, there is no need to compete.  But if you really need, I can ask someone ... :) <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <strong>When did <a href="http://mazoo.net/">mazoo networks appear</a> ?</strong>  <strong>What is this project for?</strong>

      It all started as one blog to keep in touch with friends.  Back in the 2001-2002 year.  The idea was successful, and a group of people was formed who enthusiastically began to publish something.  I was interested in just trying different things for posting on the net, so I tried all the best blogging software.  Having tried almost everything that could be tried, I stopped at MovableType.  In the fall of 2003, all interested enthusiastic friends got their blogs, some of which are still ongoing.  The task ‚Äúfor what?‚Äù Smoothly flowed from the state of ‚Äútry technology‚Äù to ‚ÄúI like to publish‚Äù, then to ‚Äúwe like to publish‚Äù, then to ‚Äúunite in one big resource‚Äù, then in ‚Äúthematic resource‚Äù, then in ‚Äúconvenient resource, then ... well, okay, yes?  I am able to continue this list indefinitely and generate new and new layers of different ‚Äúwhy‚Äù. <br><br>  The most valuable thing in blog networks is the collection and organization of resources with a common interest or goal, or a single ‚Äúcontrol center‚Äù.  This allows you to solve larger problems than a single blogger can solve. <br><br>  <strong>What does mazoo give to its members?</strong>  <strong>Does the network justify its existence?</strong> <br><br>  You can say that the network gives the participants some traffic and makes it more noticeable, but it's boring and banal.  It can be said that this network gave before, when the authors of the participating blogs were a small group of friends, but this time has passed, now we are accepting everyone who‚Äôs blogs meet our criteria for relevance and quality.  So now we have a certain transitional moment from what was and is, to what network of blogs I imagine to myself ideally. <br><br>  <strong>In RuNet there are other network premium blogs.</strong>  <strong>Is there already competition?</strong> <br><br>  We have no competition with BlogSummit.  I even enter the BlogSummit selection committee, we advise on many networking issues.  There will be competition when a dozen or two networks appear, and they start generating content and money, then there will be something to share.  In the meantime, high-quality blogs can all be listed in the mind, and blog-rating tops are known even to those who have never been on the Internet, and we don‚Äôt have much to compete with. <br><br>  <strong>What are your plans for mazoo networks?</strong>  <strong>What are the prospects for mazoo and in general networks of premium blogs (in RuNet and in the West)?</strong> <br><br>  I do not like declarations of intent and announcements of services not yet made, so I can say that I have a vision and concept of how mazoo.net will develop, but there is no time and resources to quickly accomplish everything.  Therefore, I am now thinking about how this is all better to crank.  :) <br><br>  Networks of blogs (I do not really understand the term "premium") depend on their management, objectives and goals.  Blog networks are subject to the same laws as any other online projects.  Examples of this are Corante, the oldest network that never received public recognition, b5media is a network created by well-known bloggers, developed in about a year and received funding of two million dollars, weblogsinc, which AOL bought, or 9rules, which is simply the largest blogging community. <br><br>  <strong>By the way, why MovableType?</strong> <br><br>  For 2001-2003, I tried a lot of different hosted solutions, some of them still visually remember the interface, but they don‚Äôt exist anymore.  And then I found the MT, set it, and ... use it.  Just poked his finger, intuitively, and immediately hit.  It happens to me.  :) All other engines for blogs and CMS tried later.  But the reason to abandon the MT is not tuck. <br><br>  <strong>Your new job is <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/company/blogus/">Blogus</a> .</strong>  <strong>What will you do in this company?</strong> <br><br>  I will work here.  :) And I decided to work here, because it is interesting.  Firstly, I consider <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/company/feedburner/">FeedBurner a</a> ‚Äúright‚Äù service, and I like the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãexpanding it to Russia.  Secondly, it is interesting to engage in projects with such great potential for development as Blogus: there are lots of directions, solutions too, ideas are generated.  The main thing is to have enough resources.  And thirdly, I repeat, interesting. <br><br>  <strong>What will Blogus be in a year?</strong>  <strong>Now this is the blog rating (at the initial stage of development) and Feedburner partner (again, at the initial stage).</strong>  <strong>What will happen to the rating?</strong> <br><br>  I do not like to talk about future plans, it is much more interesting to proudly answer the questions ‚ÄúHow did you achieve this?‚Äù And all that.  :) Now I see Blogus as a good social service for bloggers and blog readers. <br><br>  The rating will be considered, updated, changed, and it will be interesting to examine, and they can be measured.  And we will not constantly show the top 10 of the same blogs on the main page.  We haven't been doing this for a long time.  ;) <br><br>  <strong>When will Feedburner be Russified?</strong>  <strong>When does the company plan to finish testing advertising in feeds?</strong> <br><br>  FeedBurner will be gradually Russified.  It turned out to be not very simple, but very interesting.  The texts contain a large number of phrases based on a pun intended for words, terms that do not have suitable Russian translation and many other tasks.  For example, it is customary in our country to address visitors to sites on ‚ÄúYou‚Äù, and the majority of slogans and appeals on FeedBurner resources in no way imply such politeness.  However, the meticulous habrovtsy already discussed this. <br><br>  Testing advertising ends in March we plan to start advertising for money.  Of the interesting details - the Russian-speaking audience, reading English-language feeds will also be covered. <br><br>  <strong>Taking into account not the strongest prevalence and popularity of RSS in runet, advertising in RSS feeds - is this relevant?</strong> <br><br>  Yes, Runet is lagging behind in the use of new technologies, but this does not hurt us.  We are not going anywhere, the technology has proven itself, and the lag can only be used to our advantage - we see what is happening all over the world.  And the RSS will be distributed, and advertising in the feeds is relevant, and we will conduct explanatory work ourselves, take the culture out of the masses and popularize RSS by all means available to us.  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/5040/">https://habr.com/ru/post/5040/</a></p>
