Maybe a little bit late, but I would like to tell a little about this contest with the eyes of a finalist. <br><br>  Looking through the tape on Habr√© stumbled upon a whole set of references to the competition.  Some are negative, some are positive, but somehow there was nothing from the participants themselves to the final.  Our service managed to reach not only the semi-finals but also participate in the final. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Submission of projects for the competition was held on the Web Ready website and <b>more than 400 applications were submitted</b> .  The figure is not small, agree.  According to the results of the work of 30 experts from all applications were selected <b>35 projects that passed to the semi-final</b> .  Both on Habr√© and on other resources, many wondered how the selection took place and why this or that project failed.  I think it would be cool to publish a table with evaluation criteria and points, for clarity.  But with so many applications it is not the easiest task.  Therefore, we leave it to the experts' conscience :) <br><br>  Of course, we were pleased that we overcame the first frontier and reached the semifinal. <br><br><h4>  Preparatory session </h4><br>  After determining the semi-finalists, the organizers arranged for all the participants preparatory and consulting sessions, which took place both in person (in St. Petersburg) and with the help of an online conference.  Considering that we are not in Russia, we took part in online sessions using the Firmbook service ( <a href="http://firmbook.ru/">http://firmbook.ru/</a> ).  By the way, the service itself, although it looks very strange and has a number of specific UI bloopers, showed itself from a very good side. <br><br>  During the sessions, our service received good reviews from the general director of Reksoft LLC, Alexander Egorov, and Microsoft Internet project expert Peter Didenko.  What a special thank you to them for!  In addition, in the online mode it was possible to follow the presentations and discussions of the projects of all the semifinalists, which was very useful and interesting. <br><br>  I think for all the semi-finalists participating in the preparatory sessions it was as useful as for us.  Experts "at the other end of the line" really spoke on the case and pointed out the strengths and weaknesses of each of the projects. <br><br><h4>  The final </h4><br>  On December 14th, 8 correspondence finalists of the competition were determined.  What all the semi-finalists were immediately informed.  We were extremely happy to get on this list and immediately ran to pack our bags and buy tickets to St. Petersburg :) <br><br>  And literally in 3 days, the final of the competition was held in St. Petersburg.  Presentations of the absentee finalists took place in a separate room, where each project was allocated a small ‚Äústand‚Äù, to which everyone could easily come up and ask their questions.  The traffic was really rather big, a huge number of experts, investors, representatives of the press and just ‚Äúonlookers‚Äù who besieged the stands :) <br><br>  All semi-finalists who did not qualify for the final were presented separately.  The task of the jury was to select an additional two participants who will join the final.  Of course, due to the abundance of really good projects, 4 projects went through to the final additionally :) A total of 12 projects reached the final. <br><br>  Then each project was given 10-12 minutes to present its project before the jury and the expert council.  After that, the jury retired to the meeting to select three prizes.  Seeing the battles when choosing winners were really considerable, because  instead of 30 minutes, everything was delayed for more than 2 hours :) <br><br>  But, to our regret, this time we did not fall into the number of three prize winners, although according to the jury‚Äôs comments we were on the short list of prize projects :) The prize places were taken by projects: <a href="http://www.insales.ru/">InSales</a> , <a href="http://www.cloudmach.com/">Cloudmach</a> and <a href="http://flaphone.com/">flaphone</a> , with which we sincerely congratulate you!  More details about the finalists can be <a href="http://www.web-ready.ru/final/">touched here</a> (along with the presentations). <br><br><h5>  A barrel of honey ... </h5><br>  Organization of 5 plus, the guys really tried.  Small time shifts do not count.  A good team of experts and the jury, communicating with some of them can really draw a lot of interesting things.  Well, the prize fund of 1 million rubles also pleased, though not us ;-) <br><br><h5>  ... and fly in the ointment :) </h5><br>  The Internet worked through the stump-deck: (This is the main disadvantage. <br><br>  Secondly, there was a huge number of photographers and operators at the competition.  I think the materials they shot also exist somewhere.  But from the organizers there is no news where all this (presentations, photosets, etc.) can be taken.  Maybe someone from their Habra-people knows secret links?  :) <br><br>  Yes, and it was a pity there was no smoking room, I had to smoke at minus 20 outside :-) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/82853/">https://habr.com/ru/post/82853/</a></p>
