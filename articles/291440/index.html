A quarter of them are made in the suburbs of Krasnoyarsk at the enterprise "Information and satellite systems.  Academician M.F.  Reshetnyova ‚Äù( <a href="http://www.iss-reshetnev.ru/">ISS</a> ).  Two thirds of the orbital grouping of Russia (satellites, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%259B%25D0%259E%25D0%259D%25D0%2590%25D0%25A1%25D0%25A1">GLONASS</a> devices) are designed in the small closed city of Zheleznogorsk. <br><br>  The city was founded in the 1950s and was named Krasnoyarsk-26.  Later it was created KB Applied Mechanics (later - ASC).  In 1995, the first navigation GLONASS was fully formed. <br><br>  From 2005 to 2014, the company's revenue increased more than 10 times - from 3.2 to 34 billion rubles.  The average salary of his employees (45,700 rubles) exceeds the salary of his Moscow colleagues.  In addition, employees are paid half of the mortgage. <a name="habracut"></a>

      The budget of the Federal Space Program for 2006-2015 amounted to 800 billion rubles.  For the next decade, it is planned to increase it to 2 trillion rubles.  310 billion rubles were allocated for GLONASS.  Signed contracts to ensure the indexation of employee salaries.  In recent years, their number has increased one and a half times and reached 8,200 people. <br><br>  According to the Satellite Industry Association ( <a href="http://www.sia.org/">SIA</a> ), the industry‚Äôs revenue in 2013 was $ 195 billion.  61% accounted for satellite radio and television, mobile communications, signal transmission.  28% accounted for ground equipment (mostly car navigators).  3% of revenue accounted for the launches of devices.  In this segment of the world market, Russia leads with a share of 30%. <br><br>  However, the share of ASCs in the global market is small.  Most of the company's total turnover includes the resale of third-party equipment and services.  Own revenue does not exceed 30% of the company's income.  This is a major issue for ASCs.  After all, according to the rules of public procurement, it can take a 20 percent margin from its own work, and only 1% from what was supplied by ‚Äúcooperation‚Äù - two hundred large and small companies that contributed to the final result.  In fact, the rate of net profit of ISS is close to 1%. <br><br>  The company specializes in ‚Äúservice system modules‚Äù of spacecraft, including the power supply of satellites, engines, control and telemetry.  This module fits the ‚Äúpayload module‚Äù.  The payload accounts for most of the value added of the device.  But it is not produced in Russia. <br><br>  The main supplier of payloads is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_Alenia_Space">Thales Alenia Space</a> , a joint venture of two defense giants, Thales (France) and Finmeccanica (Italy).  In 2012, their revenues amounted to 2.1 billion euros.  This is several times higher than the revenue of ASC. <br><br>  From 25% to 75% of radio electronics on a Russian satellite is imported, and civilian satellites have a higher share than military ones, <a href="http://top.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/10/06/2015/557706709a79476fe14467d0">told</a> ISS Director General Nikolai Testoedov to RBC.  Such dependence can be ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù in terms of sanctions. <br><br>  The RBC source at FSUE Space Communications believes that in this case you should not be afraid of sanctions.  For Thales, the delivery of the payload is no less profitable than the production of its own devices.  But, according to him, the ISS problem is that the enterprise‚Äôs satellites do not have commercial potential. <br><br>  However, Testoyedov is sure that the market is worse than the state order: the demand in the communications satellite market significantly exceeds supply.  It is necessary to change devices less often, and each next one takes over several times the payload.  As a result, margins on commercial orders are comparable to state ones, but for the first one they have to fight in tenders, and the latter are secured for many years to come, he argues. <br><br>  According to Testoedov, the ISS now has ‚Äúthree roughly the same pillars - the Ministry of Defense, the Federal Space Agency and commercial customers, both Russian and foreign.‚Äù <br><br>  Sanctions can have a positive impact on the affairs of the enterprise.  Recently, the operator of Gazprom has decided to revise the tender for the supply of a telecommunications satellite already won by Thales Alenia Space.  Such measures are aimed at expanding the influence of domestic producers (in this case, ASC) on the Russian market. <br><br>  And since the space program was adopted until 2025, ‚Äúthe order book is ten years ahead,‚Äù says Testoedov. <br><br>  In the <a href="http://daily.rbc.ru/ratings/business/04/06/2015/55674b3d9a7947eee1956ff0">ranking of the</a> 50 largest Russian technology companies RBC ISS them.
