With the help of our platform, such opportunities appear, of course, that we can‚Äôt allow ourselves to fence the garden out of replacing caller ID or tricky call termination schemes to our customers (no one has canceled the communication law), but to help modernize the corporate mobile network customer tasks we are always happy. <br><br>  We will try to give a few examples of life hacking from the life of the cloudy mobile AltegroCloud. <br><br>  <b>A typical corporate mobile connection with our SIM cards looks like this:</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d7f/d2c/b39/d7fd2cb396234ebbb0511133ac6f4316.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      For simplicity, we will not take into account the existence of office fixed telephones, just assume that they exist, but they are off-screen - let them call where they want, they are not interesting to us today.  We are interested in employees on mobiles: courier Anatoly Antolievich (appears in the office only to sign a vacation), project manager Evgeny (works at home, but is on the staff) and two very nimble veteran managers - Oleg Petrovich and Oleg Valerevich (endless meetings and business - breakfast).  All of them are called by clients a lot, each on their own question, but our task is to build a scheme so that the whole team is under our control (we watch their online statistics in CRM, listen to the recordings of conversations, observe the location on the map), and it was convenient for customers they dial up. <br><br>  We make the assumption that the company already had corporate cellular communications and moving to new SIM cards with the loss of existing cell phone numbers is not an option.  Customers have been calling Oleg on mobiles for 15 years and changing their numbers means destroying the whole business.  Well, we are trying to keep old mobile numbers on new SIM cards. <br><br>  <b>If you have a corporate connection from Megaphone</b> <br><br>  Once, when the trees were small, the advanced colleagues from Megafon launched a very interesting ‚ÄúMultifon‚Äù service, in fact, this was the first attempt at friendship of Internet telephony and cellular communication, and this is really interesting, half of the work for our task has already been done. <br><br>  <b>We do this:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad7/5a1/50d/ad75a150d5e7492bab55478ac559a33d.png" alt="image"><br>  On the old corporate SIM cards, we connect the ‚ÄúMultifon‚Äù service, obtain the necessary credentials to set up SIP accounts, and remove the SIM cards themselves into the box, we will no longer need them.  We configure the obtained credentials for each SIM card as a trunk for incoming communication with registration on AltegroCloud and in the admin panel of Klaud we compare our new corporate SIM cards and the created trunks (recall that from the point of view of AltegroCloud logic our SIM cards are indistinguishable from a regular SIP device).  Now, each new SIM card, in addition to the short office number, is also assigned an old, ‚Äúmegafonovskiy‚Äù number, and all incoming numbers for these numbers pass through the PBX, are included in the statistics, in the conversation recording and in all other scenarios. <br><br>  With outgoing communication, everything is also simple: since our SIMs look at PBXs like ordinary SIP devices, all outgoing calls from SIMs are sent to an external trunk and at the output we compile a table that indicates that when calling from a certain SIM card, an outgoing call the appropriate caller ID is assigned (the one that is old, which is megaphone).  The task of moving to new SIM cards is solved, the numbers are saved, customers will not notice anything, our two Oleg continue to make sales at a frantic pace, but now we see them, hear and control in AltegroCloud, Oleg has to double the volumes, otherwise we will lose their bonuses. <br><br>  <b>If you have a corporate mobile connection from any other operator</b> <br><br>  In this case, the task of keeping the numbers somewhat more complicated, will have to be wise, but we love to wise and know how.  We need a virtual buffer number, working on SIP.  We configure this virtual number as an external trunk for incoming calls to AltegroCloud, this is simple and fast, and then we‚Äôve started to trick: <br><br>  - on old SIM cards, we enable unconditional forwarding to the buffer number (each redirected incoming call will cost money, but not very large) in the AltegroCloud scripts a new entity appears - DivHeader, a special field in which not only the subscriber number A is transmitted during the redirected call ( the one that calls us) and the number of subscriber B (who is being called), but also the conditional number of the Subscriber C (i.e. the number of the mobile phone from which the forwarded call came).  Knowing this very ‚ÄúC‚Äù number, we know from which SIM card the redirection came and to whom this SIM card used to belong and send the call through all the scenarios of our PBX to the AltegroCloud corporate SIM card, like a normal internal office phone. <br><br>  - Sergey Sergeevich‚Äôs client calls Oleg Petrovich‚Äôs manager on his old Beeline, Beeline honestly redirects the call to the service number, we catch the ‚ÄúC‚Äù number at the entrance, look at the table of comparisons and see that Oleg Petrovich now has a corporate SIM card with a short number 419 and redirect Sergey Sergeyevich immediately to him.  Voila, Petrovich is called by his new Simka, and Sergeyitch will never guess that his call has been forwarded.  Task completed, incoming saved, recorded, and ranked. <br><br>  At the same time, Eugene is connected to the same scheme, but with a number from the MTS.  Bottom line: there was a zoo from numbers of different companies, but we collected all the numbers in one pool and sent them to single corporate sims with short numbers and managed all the calls from one interface.  Eugene is also forced to add momentum, stories about unanswered calls are no longer accepted, we see everything and we listen to everything. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1cd/c74/5d2/1cdc745d260246d89329eec64da71cc0.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Are you ready to abandon the old mobile numbers and start using the company number for all incoming</b> <br><br>  The simplest and most understandable from the point of view of the logic of the PBX solution.  We declare to all customers that now Olegi, Evgenia and Anatoly Anatolyevich are available by a single company number, which is listed on the website, and employees are available always and everywhere.  Such are the wonders.  But we will add "beautiful" in the scheme for the convenience of dear customers: <br><br>  - write a script that will create a bunch of ‚Äúcustomer number - internal number of employee's SIM card‚Äù after the first conversation took place.  Ali Rasulovich called us for the first time, the secretary, after a short dialogue, transferred him to the mobile of Oleg Petrovich, Oleg Petrovich on the run promised to send the CP.  Automatically put a tick: Ali Rasulovich and Oleg Petrovich are now connected for a century and we immediately send all calls from Ali Rasulovich‚Äôs number to the company‚Äôs sim card Oleg Petrovich.  Very convenient for everyone. <br><br>  - partially use the tricky scenario from point 2 (above, where the buffer number is) and set up redirection from old SIMs to the incoming AltegroCloud city number.  In the Klauda scenarios, we indicate that every time a new forwarded call comes from a mobile phone, we pick up the phone and pronounce a polite voice message - ‚ÄúThe staff numbers have changed, wait for the SMS with the new numbers,‚Äù and then automatically send the SMS to the client, where we politely indicate that Anatoly Anatolyevich is now always available at a single company number, you just need to call him.  The robot will do the rest - when it comes in, it goes to CRM, looks at the responsible manager and sends a call to Anatoly Anatolyevich directly, without any questions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9e9/c1d/0d5/9e9c1d0d5ab048bcbaf64c74f5615f46.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Pro outgoing communication from corporate mobile</b> <br><br>  We have dealt with complex ways of preserving mobile numbers, now we will try to deal with the outgoing connection, which, as any telephone operator knows, is a completely separate entity and can be controlled separately from the incoming one by setting its own rules. <br><br>  It's all quite simple: the choice is not great - for Eugene outgoing from a mobile phone, we show either a single company number or the number of its old mobile phone.  It all depends on what we need: wean clients to call back Eugene‚Äôs mobile phone or, conversely, make them think that Eugene is calling from an old mobile number (in real estate agency schemes this often happens: you need to play as hard as possible with a young Slavic family phone from an ad at the entrance) even when calling from corporate phones. <br><br>  Both the one and the other scheme are made very easily - the number that we will show for outgoing may differ even depending on who we call: <br><br>  - Courier Anatoly Anatolyevich from a mobile phone calls Marina‚Äôs client and wants her to see the single office number, not his personal number, because Anatoly Anatolyevich just delivered the laptop to the apartment and wants to forget Marina as soon as possible.  He and so every day tormented by calls to all and sundry. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b06/144/4db/b061444dbe824117bcf36fe7d78ece3f.png" alt="image"><br>  - Courier Anatoly Anatolyevich delivers baby food to the client Natalia every week, and Natalya often calls Anatolia and takes delivery time.  It is easier for Anatolia to receive calls on a mobile phone immediately, without voice menus on a single company number, but the call still has to go through the PBX, needs to be recorded and displayed on the transaction card in CRM.  In this case, with outgoing, we show Anatoly's individual number, which is sent as one of the incoming ones on our PBX. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/160/bee/bcc/160beebcc40745ae9ef9040ac9e25079.png" alt="image"><br>  The above techniques and life hacking, when properly implemented, allow you to create really smart mobile call processing scenarios in an office PBX that are capable of greatly improving the company's image and raising revenue.  Managing cellular corporate communications is really very convenient.  Continuation, despite the holiday season, should be. <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/262743/">https://habr.com/ru/post/262743/</a></p>
