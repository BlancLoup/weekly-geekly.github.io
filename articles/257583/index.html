In this article I would like to structure a number of facts and propose strategies for improving reference profiles. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ewQYRf7CP7Y%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg_nksAMyZ24yju_p0nec1-YBH8XA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In mid-April (after the Minusinsk algorithm was announced), some sites received notifications about too many SEO links.  What could have served as a catalyst for the triggering of the algorithm and which sites came under these warnings? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The MegaIndex team analyzed over 3000 sites to which we have access to Yandex Webmaster.  Among them are sites that are both promoted in MegaIndex and never advanced.  There are also sites that use other <a href="http://altwebcapital.com/projects/">ALTWeb Group</a> services ( <a href="http://pflink.ru/">PFLink.ru</a> , <a href="http://serpclick.ru/">SERPClick.ru</a> , etc.)

      As I <a href="https://www.megaindex.org/analiz_vneshnih_ssyilok_v_megaindex_i_obnovlenie_algoritma_zakupki">wrote earlier</a> , MegaIndex has sufficiently updated the algorithm for purchasing links, which affected a significant change in the reference weight and parameters of the reference profile.  Among the sites that are advancing in MegaIndex, no more than 2% of the sites received notifications from Yandex.  This is significantly less when compared with commercial sites that are not promoted in the system. <br><br>  This was due to several reasons: <br>  1. About 20% of project references were purchased on new resources in the last 30 days. <br>  2. In selecting donors, we significantly tightened the criteria for evaluating spamming: <br>  - the ratio of the number of unique external links to the number of documents on the site <br>  - parameters of the sites to which the donor refers (see the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25BC_HITS">HITS</a> algorithm) <br>  3. Most of our customers are actively using technology to improve the quality of reference profiles. <br><br>  <strong>Reinforcing links</strong> <br><br>  It is already obvious that the impact of links in search rankings will increase significantly.  Yandex is trying to make the signal from external links less noisy, which will increase its influence in the ranking formula (this is an unavoidable measure, as the machine learning algorithm will notice the correlation of high-quality sites and high-quality reference profiles) <br><br>  Some sites with a large mass of poor-quality links will gradually reduce their number, which will definitely increase the impact of the remaining links in the whole market.  However, it is obvious that the removal of a significant proportion of external links will lead to irreparable problems for sites: <br>  a.  Decrease position in Google and Yandex <br>  b.  Reduced search traffic <br>  with.  Deterioration of behavioral metrics due to traffic drop <br>  d.  Slow down the development of the site in light of the decrease in the number of orders <br>  e.  Further fall of the site due to the fall of a number of behavioral about commercial metrics <br><br>  In this situation, the advantage will be those sites that can purchase the maximum number of links without exceeding the threshold values ‚Äã‚Äãof the leaders of the procurement on the subject.  Automation systems that can solve this analytical problem are the best suited for this task.  Also, the question of improving the quality of the reference profile due to indirect factors (links links, links from social networks, the naturalness of the anchor list and the proportion of non-anchor links, donated topics) is also an urgent issue. <br><br>  <strong>Methods for improving reference profiles</strong> <br><br>  Let us consider in more detail the methods of solving all problems: <br><br>  <em>1. Referrals</em> <br><br>  Back in August, we launched the <a href="http://pflink.ru/">PFLink</a> technology, which allows you to bring living people through links.  Read more article on <a href="http://www.forbes.ru/reklama/266987-usilenie-ssylok-megaindex-o-novoi-ere-avtomatizirovannogo-prodvizheniya-saitov">Forbes</a> <br><br>  How to launch <a href="https://www.megaindex.org/v_megaindex_poyavilos_usilenie_ssyilok_jivyimi_polzovatelyami">link reinforcement in MegaIndex</a> <br><br>  <em>2. Links from social networks</em> <br><br>  On April 15 we launched the service <a href="http://getsocial.ru/">GetSocial.ru</a> , which allows you to receive links from profiles of people in social networks.  Such links will not only improve the performance of the link profile, but also lead traffic, as well as promote your brand in social networks. <br><br>  <em>3. The naturalness of the anchor list and the proportion of non-anchor links.</em> <br><br>  You can get a better anchor list by expanding the semantics of promoted queries.  For this, a specialized tool in the MegaIndex reference purchasing module ‚Äúrecommended requests‚Äù is well suited <br><br>  Also do not forget that in MegaIndex, the purchase share of linksless links is configured.  Be sure to recommend checking the value of this parameter and maintaining it at least 20%. <br><br>  <em>4. Topics of donors</em> <br><br>  The key advantage of the MegaIndex link purchasing algorithm has always been the possibility of a high-quality search for donors that are relevant to your website.  We have specially built for this a hierarchy of topics, which is divided into more than 5000 categories.  Right now this opportunity is becoming more meaningful.  To purchase more thematic links, we recommend lowering the requirements for thematic donors and carefully checking the topics that are set for your project in the system settings. <br><br>  PS MegaIndex today is the only system of purchasing links, which has a complete index of the global Internet in terms comparable to Google.  This gives us and you unlimited analytical possibilities for analyzing the reference profiles of any site and allows you to add maximum results in the promotion. <br><br>  Follow the dynamics of changes in the reference mass and the parameters of the reference <a href="https://www.megaindex.ru/index.php%3Ftab%3DlinkAnalyze%26do%3DlinkIn%26site%3Dsite.ru%26path%3D%252F*%26anchor%3D">profiles of any site</a> <br><br> <a href="https://www.megaindex.ru/index.php%3Ftab%3DlinkAnalyze%26do%3DlinkIn%26site%3Dsite.ru%26path%3D%252F*%26anchor%3D"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/403/1f9/001/4031f90013704c13446dd82d31c21c22.png"></a> <br><br>  I am also particularly pleased to announce that MegaIndex is becoming a global platform for website promotion, which starts operating on the <a href="http://www.megaindex.com/">MegaIndex.com</a> domain <a href="http://www.megaindex.com/">.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/257583/">https://habr.com/ru/post/257583/</a></p>
