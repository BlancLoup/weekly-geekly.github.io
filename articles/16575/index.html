  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The pursuit of excellence</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Eh.  Yet one of the few that distinguishes a person from an ant stupidly performing a monotonous work is the striving for perfection.  And sooner or later, anyone who does not like life-long sitting at the monotonous work in a regular desk for 10-15 thousand rubles a month, such desire arises. <br><br>  Do you know how a single IT specialist suddenly realizes that in essence he is nothing more than an enikeyschik or bydlokoder?  Yes, in his work he is considered cool, yes, for the uninitiated, his actions seem to be shamanism, and it would seem that you can stop at this ... but suddenly an IDEA comes to mind!  Suppose some simple but ingenious web startup.  Not everything is riveted monotonous Saitics of three pages in the office of Pupkin Incorporated, right?  Here, it appears, the idea is being brainwashed, already in the head there is the design of the page, and the structure of the bases, and much more ... and here the cast-iron ass of reality hits the dreams. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  For example, for comfortable work with the site, you need an offline client with the ability to quickly and painlessly synchronize with the site (and do not need to say that this is garbage - and you remember last.fm).  Moreover, in order not to cut off users of different operating systems, the client should be easily ported even under Windu, even under Linux, even under that.  What?  We wrote only on php, and even at school / technical school on Delphi?  Well, yes, in all this in this case you will not go far, and there is no money to hire a third-party coder.  That's what I'm talking about.

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"

      Or another example.  Again, to raise on a third-party engine site from three pages - is simple.  Writing two or three database requests with your hands is also easy.  But when it is necessary to write complicated algorithms for aggregation and data processing, and those that can withstand a large influx of site visitors - I bet, most will regret that the fundamentals of algorithmization in the computer course of informatics seemed an unnecessary anachronism, and citizens never learned such discrete mathematics. <br><br>  What is the perspective (albeit not very experienced) specialist in this case different from the hopeless bydlokodera?  The specialist will explore all possible libraries and bookstores, will overlap with literature and begin to study all this in every way.  Even if the idea with the startup is scored in the end - but knowledge is never superfluous, and everything that has been learned will somehow come in handy (which will affect both moral satisfaction and the thickness of the wallet).  And bydlokoder about all this and not think.  "Why do I need to read all this stuff ... yes, in principle, and these projects are needed ... I am well fed here, figs with him."  And if he loses his vanity, he wants to do something of his own - in most cases it ends with the purchase of the cheapest hosting, installing WordPress on it and picking up the FIG know what the bill on earnings in the network is about, where the next banalities will be fasting about SEO and RSS feeds ... <br><br>  And to what, I actually write this rather banal reasoning ... I read as recently as yesterday another Talmud of documentation on promising technologies, and an IDEA came to me ... and, yes, I did understand how little I still know.  However, the more you read books and follow the news, the more you understand it, these are just dropouts, having mastered a couple of functions with grief, they believe that "they already know everything."  Striving for perfection is an endless road, and I wish everyone good luck and patience on their way! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/16575/">https://habr.com/ru/post/16575/</a></p>
