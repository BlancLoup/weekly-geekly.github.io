  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Draft Mozilla Drumbeat is gaining momentum</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Amazingly, but on Habr√© there was still no topic dedicated to one of the big Mozilla brainchild - the Drumbeat project.  There is very little information on the Internet in Russian, of course, this is due to the fact that the project <a href="http://www.drumbeat.org/">website is</a> in English only.  If Mozilla allocated over a million dollars for Drumbeat, and the Mark Shuttleworth Foundation participated in the support, then it may be worth getting to know the details and features of this (so far only foreign) social network. <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/ea/67/ea676311c6b3592197aea0ee3771907b.png"></a> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  What is Mozilla Drumbeat? </h5><br>  Drumbeat is a subsidiary project, according to them - an incubator of promising ideas for uniting and training community members.  The community here is a web.  This resource brings together people who want to make the Internet the way they would like to see it, improve it.  The name of the project (eng. "Drumbeat") says that participants will not only be engaged in planning, discussing and sitting in forums, but will strive to "be heard", setting the results of their labors for public evaluation.  True, the logo is a bit like a keg from the game "Lotto".  As with everything in Mozilla - in the first place - teamwork and openness, transparency of the project.  In one of the reviews it was precisely noted: Drumbeat is a container of mini-projects for democratizing the Internet.

      After registering, any person from anywhere in the world can create their own project, become the initiator of a new program, relying, thus, on the help of the rest of the like-minded community or focus on existing ones.  When creating a new startup, you must specify the price in dollars, explain to people how they can participate in the project, or lay out a demo video explaining the essence of the plan.  The site Drumbeat says: "Let's do it in the style of Firefox and Mozilla - attract as many people as possible!"  Therefore, if the new proposal improves the technologies of the Internet, promotes the replacement of closed web formats with open ones, for example, will serve not only IT geeks, but also teachers, lawyers, directors, actors, writers, officials, etc., required <br><br>  To date, the work on 200 startups is in the Drumbeat joint projects catalog.  According to Mark Serman, executive director of the Mozilla Foundation, $ 300,000 has been allocated to support them. Some of them are listed on the Mozilla <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/">projects page</a> .  Of the large projects, Universal Subtitles (subtitles, translation and video cataloging) and WebMadeMovies (an association of cinematographers, artists and IT specialists) are worth noting.  Projects like P2PU School of Webcraft (location-independent; alternative to tradition) and Privacy Icons by web designer Aza Raskin, who leads the work on the user's environment at Mozilla (Aza, the son of the famous project founder, Macintosh "Jeff Raskin).  ‚ÄúPrivacy Icons‚Äù - a lot of logos explaining the main points of the privacy policy and how to create visual components without violating anyone‚Äôs rights. <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/98/d7/98d7e541350a8f1fda9f5d184c262a74.png"></a> <br>  Each year, the three best projects from the catalog that collected the most votes will be offered to provide resources: a significant amount of traffic, promotion on the Internet sites, advice from experienced experts, integration with Firefox (if it makes sense), part of donations and separate Mozilla funding in the amount of 5 up to $ 25,000, at least at the very beginning. <br><br>  Drumbeat is currently in beta.  And, although after the launch of the project, for a long time, people just followed the project, now they are beginning to wonder: ‚ÄúHow can I join?‚Äù.  I hope with the forces of such an experienced and powerful organization as Mozilla, the world will see many realized ideas that will serve all of us. <br><br>  Like-minded people hold local meetings and events at their place of residence, and Mozilla holds the annual Drumbeat festival, which is in many ways similar to open and free seminars held by large IT companies in Russia. <br><br>  PS Also, some supported projects can be viewed on the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Drumbeat/projects/projectmanagement">wiki-resource</a> Mozilla.org. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108850/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108850/</a></p>
