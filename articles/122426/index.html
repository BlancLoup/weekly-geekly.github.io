  <section class="page js-page"><h1>WebMoney Escrow Secure Transaction Service</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We present to your attention a novelty - <a href="http://escrow.webmoney.ru/"><b>Transaction Protection Service</b></a> . <br><br>  Internet business, in essence, is fraught with certain risks - relative anonymity makes it attractive to all kinds of scammers.  This is especially true of freelance services, the provision of one-time services via the Internet.  A novice freelancer, before gaining some experience, always first does a few times his work for unscrupulous customers.  At the same time, the reverse cases are not so rare when the customer, having made an advance payment, cannot then find traces of the hired freelancer. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It is precisely such unpleasant situations that are to prevent the new <a href="http://www.webmoney.ru/">WebMoney</a> service, which will act as a trusted party in the transaction between the seller and the buyer, and, through pledges, will insure them against unfair fulfillment of the conditions.

    <h1>  How it works </h1><br>  The principle of operation of the service is similar to the action of a bank escrow agent: <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Igf-rT1AlE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhj74NLfiD9d27dlgcC3T35y50ZThw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The seller or buyer creates an offer to the user from his list of contacts in WebMoney, specifies the subject and amount of the transaction, the amount of deposits, the term of the transaction and the time during which you need to accept or reject the offer.  The second party agrees, perhaps, having previously made changes to the conditions.  Pledges are made, a deal is created. <br><br>  Further, upon the expiration of the transaction, or even before its occurrence, the following scenarios are possible: <br><br>  1. Confirmation of successful completion of the transaction is received from both parties - funds deposited as a guarantee payment are returned to the participants (or the Seller, if the terms of the transaction stipulate that the security deposit made by the Buyer should be used as payment).  If after the deadline of the transaction, no party has confirmed its implementation, but no claims or lawsuits have been filed with the Arbitration, then the transaction is also considered successful; <br><br>  2. The parties mutually decided to cancel the transaction - funds deposited as a guarantee payment are also returned to the participants; <br><br>  3. One of the parties reported on the fulfillment of the terms of the transaction, and the other party declared a violation of its terms, then the transaction is considered ‚Äúcontroversial.‚Äù <br><br>  In this case, the security deposit will not be paid to anyone until the parties agree and either confirm the successful completion of the transaction or cancel it out mutually.  If the parties do not come to an agreement within 10 days, then any of them can file a claim with the <a href="https://wiki.webmoney.ru/wiki/show/%25D0%2590%25D1%2580%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B6/">Arbitration</a> directly on the Escrow service website.  According to the results of consideration of the claim by the Arbitration, the liens of both participants are transferred to the winning party, minus the 10% commission of the Arbitration. <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãservice is not new, such schemes are actively used in the real estate business, and any other business area where the risk of unfair fulfillment of the terms of the transaction is unacceptable for one of the parties.  Such services exist for a long time and on the Internet, but compared to what is now presented in runet, our new product has several strengths. <br>  First, our service is free, the arbitrators will have to pay commission only in the event of a dispute and the impossibility of settling it on their own.  Secondly, it is integrated directly into the payment system (which, for the most part, freelancers and customers use for mutual settlements), that is, it is not necessary to replenish third-party accounts.  Thirdly, the owners of Internet resources are provided with <a href="https://escrow.webmoney.ru/developers.aspx/">APIs</a> in the form of web services so that Escrow can be integrated directly into their website.  Web services allow you to post offers and manage transactions from a remote server, i.e.  without going to escrow.webmoney.ru. <br><br>  Well, in general, something like that.  Now you can not rely on chance and decency of the customer / employee, and be confident that the work performed in good faith will be fully paid in good faith.  Good luck with business. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122426/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122426/</a></p>
