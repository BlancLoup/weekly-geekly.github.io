At the same time, from improvised means with them, as a rule, only the telephone.  What to do? <a name="habracut"></a>

      At first I tried to use a notebook in the phone.  But the trouble is that I remembered its existence, as a rule, only when something needs to be written down :) <br><br>  As it turned out once when communicating with friends, they have the same story.  Continuing the thought, we decided to make such a service as Mylophone.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãservice is simple: <br>  - you call to the number of Soap Phone +7 (925) 783-75-12 and dictate your message; <br>  - the service translates voice into text and sends it to you by email; <br>  - just in case, the letter contains a link to a file with voice recording. <br><br>  You can try to use the service right now.  The only thing you need to do is first create a binding &lt;phone number&gt; ---. <br><br>  This requires registration.  It is extremely simple - you fill in two fields on the site <a href="http://www.mylofon.com/">www.mylofon.com</a> and you are done!  Your email will receive a password to access your personal account.  You may need it in the future to change email or to change some settings. <br><br>  In your personal account, you can set a template for the subject and body of the sent letter.  As well as one of the options: <br>  - ‚Äúdo not answer the call‚Äù <br>  - ‚Äúanswer the call after a voice greeting‚Äù <br>  - ‚ÄúPick up the phone immediately‚Äù <br><br>  As it turned out already in the process of implementing the service, the message recording passes without lifting the handset.  Our joy knew no bounds!  After all, this meant that calls can be completely free! <br><br>  Then, however, our joy was slightly clouded - it turned out that for some reason this is not working for Beeline numbers.  That's why I had to enter these options.  And for all numbers, with the exception of Beeline prefixes, the option ‚Äúnot answer the call‚Äù is activated by default. <br><br><h5>  What are the advantages of the service? </h5><br>  - Most of the time we spend in places where there is a GSM connection. <br>  - To use the service to a disgrace is simple - to dial a number from a notebook.  And no matter what your phone is. <br>  - The user determines the cost of the service for himself (‚Äúpay as much as you want‚Äù). <br>  - The cost of a call is often free, the maximum is the cost of a call to a regular Megfon number.  The idea to write is much more expensive :-) <br><br><h5>  Technical information </h5><br>  Since most of the residents of Habr are IT people, I think many will be interested in what the service is made of.  Therefore, I‚Äôll immediately answer that the service is ‚Äústuck together‚Äù from the Multifon, Asterisk and Google Speech Recognition. <br><br><h5>  Integration </h5><br>  Recently, after reading the book by David Allen, I started using the GTD service - Nirvanahq.  Like many other services, it provides email to which you can send yourself notes.  So later it was this email that I indicated in Myelofon, and now I can send myself notes by voice directly to the ‚Äúinbox basket‚Äù. <br>  Similarly, Mylophone can be integrated with any service that has an import from email.  For example, with Evernote.  How to find out the email of your account in Evernote is described in sufficient detail here: <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/2010/03/17/mail-to-evernote/">blog.evernote.com/ru/2010/03/17/mail-to-evernote</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/169533/">https://habr.com/ru/post/169533/</a></p>
