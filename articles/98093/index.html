And they didn‚Äôt just say it, but they did it, without any altercations and unnecessary questions, which little reseller could boast of. <br>  But all this was, apparently, too long ... <br>  For the new management of the company, the image of the company apparently does not cost anything, and they are ready to slow down and otbrykivatsya in a deliberately hopeless situation, in the hope that the client will do something stupid or simply score on it. <br><br>  Not so long ago, I ordered a couple of Kodak Zi6 camcorders from them that are familiar to Habr readers from my <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/DIY/96467/">previous publications.</a> <br>  I ordered this pair of cameras through the online store of a messenger.  Taking into account the fact that I took two cameras at once, I was also entitled to free delivery, which could not but rejoice.  They called me back, asked for the delivery address and agreed on time. <br>  However, at the appointed time, the courier never arrived at my place, and a couple of hours later they called me from the contact, asked if the order was delivered to me :-) The next day, they again called me from the contact, apologized, called the objective reasons for the delay, agreed to postpone the date and delivery time.  This time everything was already clear ... And I thought, well, you are not sure of your level of service, lag but they correct themselves, well done, to know they have their own tracking of terms there, wow Europa-A ... <br>  In vain, I thought so and on June 28 I bought another camera from them, called the hotline, I was prompted by the nearest salon where this camera was available. <br>  When I decided to try the camera in action, it turned out one unpleasant moment, after a couple of minutes of work, the camera spontaneously turns off, and begins to repeatedly make a shutdown sound, does not react to the switch, it can only be stopped by pulling out the batteries. <br>  On July 1, I called the hotline of the contact, where I described the situation, I was asked to clarify whether the defect was obvious, and then they told me that I needed to take the camera to the salon where I bought it, they will return the money to me or make a replacement, but so-so they do not have it in stock, I should call the store and arrange with them that they would order a camera and when it arrives I could come and exchange the purchased goods of inadequate quality. <br>  It sounds great, and I called the salon, from where they promised to call me back, but they never called me back.  And I, bearing in mind that the weekend was coming, I decided to try to just come and return the money, and on the way back buy the same camera in another coherent one, the good information about the availability of the goods provides the hotline. <br>  In the salon, after I showed the defect, the seller long and hard called somewhere, consulted and eventually gave me that I'm sorry brother, I would take this camera from you, but then she would be sent for examination, they would not recognize the factory marriage , and the refund amount from the salary will be deducted.  I refused to give a written refusal, naturally, but said that I could leave them with a camera for examination and for 10 days ... <br>  Yeah, right on the same expertise, they will send it, and the result ... well, you probably already guessed it, and I also guessed. <br>  The lawyer says that I did it very correctly, because the papers from the examinations in court have weight, regardless of anything. <br>  I called the hotline, where they switched me to a girl who even politely refused to introduce herself completely, and no less politely sent me to write a statement in writing, which will be considered during the blah blah ... <br>  And I decided that if you write any statements in writing, then, probably, not in a coherent :-) (here I‚Äôm not quite right) <br>  On the way to the subway, I called a familiar lawyer, who recommended that I leave my autograph in their review book, explaining the need for this by saying that "You will see how their attitude to you will change immediately." <br>  And because the devil did not lie, when I returned, the shop was already closing, but the seller recognized me and opened the door. <br>  Hearing about the book, he quickly closed it back, and for reliability, even with some blinds, he covered it in half, and began to call again somewhere. <br>  And I wondered how I would leave an autograph if they shut up there for the whole evening, passers-by who wished to replenish their phones with a connected account, but who saw only me in front of the barricaded door, offered to call the police because of a blatant violation of the law on trade, and generally ‚Äú... judge all of them are reptiles ... ", as well as" ... well, you apparently are quite an office sucker, brother, to buy something connected, I reproach me, I bought there ... "Thanks to the public for not letting me be bored until the seller came to me and did not handed me that very treasured book.  He even gave me a pen, but refused to let me into the salon.  With a lot of me, as a person who has atrophied that part of the brain that is responsible for writing, pretty much strained.  In other matters, after a while, the director of the salon approached, a girl worthy of an invite to leprosy, she did let me in.  I wasn‚Äôt offered to sit down, but thanks to that and writing on some plane, it still turns out to be much more convenient ... <br>  But this girl was pretty tense when I was glad that I was going to take pictures of my scribbles.  And sincerely tried to convince me that I do not have the right to do so according to their corporate rules, and she will now call for protection. <br>  I noticed that I was not an employee of a coherent company and wanted to spit on their corporate rules, and since I am a citizen of the Russian Federation, I can call the police hotline for the protection of my civil rights and freedoms, if you are drunk the company will physically encroach on them :-) To which she replied that ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt just have such a security service,‚Äù and apparently began to call that same service.  Which she, to her, is pure in terms of concepts, explained to me that I have the right to take a picture, but to fold my neck because of the bullshit of a goat, I‚Äôm not really understanding what it is and it can be a bezpont ... <br>  And indeed, what a normal kid would be for 2500 wooden, would bother, would return lave, and there would be no bazaar. <br>  And now the buyer, purely on the principle of going, will listen to the voice recorder, and figure out whether the careless words of the connected ones can cost something. <br>  The fact that they will return the money is not even a question from the point of view of a lawyer in this situation, but the matter is no longer about money. </div>
