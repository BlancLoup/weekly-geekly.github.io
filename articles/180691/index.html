A very funny situation in which it seems that negotiations are moving in the right direction, but the understanding of the financial issue by the customer stubbornly remains captive to its illusions. <br><br>  And besides, we are not talking about some kind of crazy projects worth millions of dollars and a couple of three years.  Everything is extremely reasonable and within a framework of sufficiently understandable functionality, at least for example, such a solution that has a <a href="http://www.sharepoint-project.ru/">corporate portal</a> and <a href="http://www.sharepoint-project.ru/electroniy-documentooborot.html">electronic document management.</a> <br><br>  Let us consider a few examples, all of which described below are absolutely true cases from the life of a managerial uneasy share: <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>"A little bit free"</b> <br><br>  Large construction company.  The number of vigorous employees scattered around the offices (that is, direct users) is about a little less than five thousand people. <br><br>  The development and implementation of a corporate portal "from scratch" is necessary.  Wishlist about the following (in general terms, of course, without detail): <br><br>  1. Development of technical specifications <br><br>  2. Development of a unique design <br><br>  3. Application of design (a separate chore song. Although for some reason there is an opinion that the drawn picture itself will leak and overlap the system, moreover, for free) <br><br>  4. Availability of all standard web parts for the portal in design (news, birthdays, polls, announcements, widgets, forum, etc.) <br><br>  5. The internal social sphere is based on the Facebook principle (this is exactly how it is, because employees love to know that the company‚Äôs management sees all their comments and correspondence) <br><br>  6. The system of monitoring the execution of orders (in the specifics of the customer) <br><br>  7. Easy version of project management system.  (well, how easy ... that is, of course, it is desirable to shove the entire MS Project, well, in the extreme case, write it from scratch, and it‚Äôs better to wind the ERP right away, so as not to run twice ...) <br><br>  8. Uploading data from 1C for a whole heap of necessary lotions <br><br>  9. Graphs of calculating the coefficient of efficiency for employees, with beautiful widgets. <br><br>  10. Search and submission of documents (without the elements of the SED, because one hundred thousand million was already paid for the SED a couple of years ago, and it seems like a stupid change, but a bunch may be needed in the future) <br><br>  11. Perhaps Business Analytics - based on data from 1C or any other customer base (exactly so - ‚Äúany other‚Äù). <br><br>  12. Well, in the appendage there are several entertaining and informational features for the creativity of all of the above. <br><br>  13. Deadline 3 months. <br><br>  In general, seriously - We get a fairly strong exhaust system for a specific customer, with an interesting design and good functionality, and, moreover, capable of expanding and fouling with other Wishpoints based on Sharepoint 2013 (so we don‚Äôt touch the core).  All customer understatements - in principle, we know better than him, so that problems do not arise.  That is, it seems like everything looks good - and so far everything is fine, everything is good.  We detail, we beat, we do the preliminary estimate, etc. <br>  Accordingly, the planned price of the entire project is pretty decent (depending on the details), but of course within reasonable limits.  Needless to be cheaper than those guys. <br><br>  Here it is interesting, offhand - at what price would you orient yourself?  Half a million?  Million?  One and a half?  Two?  Three? ... and no ... it's not so simple ... there is no question of a chic project, but it turns out: <br>  The estimated budget at the customer - 200 thousand rubles for everything.  Where such a budget came from and how they claimed it was completely incomprehensible, but here it is.  "Two hundred thousand rubles and zero zero kopecks" - as the classics said.  No sovru, fail me on the spot. <br><br>  A detailed examination of these figures - pops up about the following understanding of client logic: <br><br>  1. Terms of Reference.  ‚ÄúIt needs to be done for free - because this is nonsense, for which we will not pay.‚Äù (Of course, it‚Äôs nice to get up in the morning and roll in small text of the Talmud more than a hundred sheets of detailed technical description, and for free. After all, TK writers are a non-existent profession. There is a janitor, there is a mechanic, there is an astronaut, and the writer's TK does not exist in nature) <br><br>  2. Design.  "We have a design on the site."  Take it and do it in it.  (the fact that there is a business card site with markup for the description of ‚Äúhow we built the whole city yesterday and how we participate in federal programs‚Äù and in principle has nothing to do with portal solutions and markup - nobody cares) <br><br>  3. Application design.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a sin to pay for it at all.‚Äù (If you wait a little while, the design will get acquainted with the web parts without the intervention of the progers, they will marry and weave together in love endeavors) <br><br>  4. Standard web parts.  (here the financial question is offensive, for that, and they are standard that would be the default for free) <br><br>  5. Social  ‚ÄúWell, thousands of fifty are ready to pay for it.  This is yes.  This is a necessary thing. ‚Äù <br><br>  6. The system of monitoring the execution of orders.  ‚ÄúToo necessary - we give thirty more pieces!‚Äù <br><br>  7. Project Management.  ‚ÄúWe are ready to single out another fifty dollars, but it is only necessary to take the entire Microsoft Project and tie it to the project.  Rather, do not take, and write from scratch.  (well, that would not pay for the license, it's so expensive ..) " <br><br>  8. Communication with 1C.  ‚ÄúWell, uploading data from 1C to Sharepoint is generally a default thing to be free of charge.‚Äù (And it‚Äôs not important that no one has any idea what data from 1C will be needed and what specifically you should unload, and whether it will be in full duplex or one-way, One-time upload or synchronization mode. It would be necessary, but we will not say a word of what. It should be the default!) <br><br>  For 9.10 and 11 points - "... we will allocate another 70 thousand. (Well, that would certainly be enough). And point 13 - well, there is nothing to discuss here." <br><br>  Settings, settings, fault tolerance, redundancy (and, as a result, ‚Äúif that‚Äù recovery), 24x7 support, etc., are by themselves provided by the contractor.  Well, this is implied and initially included in the estimated price of the customer.  Well, what else is that ..? <br><br>  Total: 200 thousand rubles. About how! <br><br>  It is rather difficult to overcome such a strange view on the operational front.  Almost impossible.  A certain time must pass before the customer wanders around the market and can come to at least the slightest understanding of the financing of such a question and revise the budget within reasonable limits.  But what is striking is the logical aspect itself, which somehow defies a definite explanation in the world of homo sapiens. And yet, these are not the most miraculous cases.  There are worse. <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúTotally Free‚Äù</b> <br><br>  For example, some customers (I must pay tribute - this is in very rare cases), they manage to fool the naughty manager for quite a while. <br><br>  After lengthy negotiations by mail and phone, at a meeting - at a large and chic seventeenth-century table made of red oak, comparable in cost to the annual budget of the average Pacific island, they say, "But let's you do us a project for free, and we will give you a good complaint?".  And even without realizing that they are putting themselves in a foolish position and in an even more foolish position of the same manager, who tirelessly dragged them through traffic jams through the whole city and who hadn‚Äôt even had a cheburek from a nonstop pig meat in the morning. <br><br>  Then there is an empty rassharkivanie and persuasion, with a permanent inflating of the cheeks in the style of "it is easier for us to pay a billion than to allocate a million from the budget."  and as a result, just a waste of time.  Have pity on the manager, he wants to go home to old mom ... <br><br>  <b>"Almost free, but with a hitch"</b> <br><br>  If the first two types, still like this, go there, that is, they represent what the third type is doing, defies any logical explanation ... <br><br>  A huge company in the outskirts of a large energy-producing city.  Company - which we see daily, hourly, nightly.  In general, a large and several thousand kilometers from Moscow. <br>  Invited to the tender (moreover, this is true, no dirty tricks and no contract).  The tender is already the second (repeated), because more or less efficient developers have refused to participate in the first.  Functional (intuitive) - something like the above in the first paragraph.  Why intuitively?  Now you understand. <br><br>  In the conditions of the tender there are about the following items (I convey only the essence, not literally): <br><br>  - contract price 800 thousand rubles (well, let's say) <br>  - deadlines 2 months (also valid) <br>  - development exclusively on the territory of the customer (that is, the stipulated amount also includes the condition that a couple of three techies and the project leader will come from Moscow and will live and work there for two months) <br>  - Of course one hundred percent postpay <br><br>  <u>and the most enchanting:</u> <br><br>  - The technical task is provided only after signing the contract (that is, it is required to agree to perform the front work, not even understanding what will be implemented) <br><br>  It is clear that in the tender and on the second attempt and in my opinion there was not a single participant. <br>  Well, here you can only dilute with your hands ... nothing to say.  If someone has any logical explanation, then state it, I will be happy to join the narrow circle of the gurus who know the life. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/180691/">https://habr.com/ru/post/180691/</a></p>
