  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How are robotic vacuum cleaners manufactured at the Yujin Robot plant in Korea?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Every day vacuum cleaner robots are becoming more and more popular.  Many potential consumers still have an opinion that this is just a toy.  Often this is due either to a lack of understanding of the principle of the gadget, or to reviews of friends who once bought a Chinese counterpart at a small price and were disappointed both in the quality of cleaning and in the reliability of the device.  I will not convince you in this article that a robot vacuum cleaner is a necessary thing in everyday life.  In our store there were many reviews from customers who do not know how they even lived without an automatic cleaner.  But what I would like to dwell on in more detail is the production of the most popular iClebo robots of the Korean company Yujin Robot (according to <a href="http://market.yandex.ru/catalog/90564/list%3Fhow%3Ddpop%26gfilter%3D2142570432:-1043122998">Yandex.Market</a> ).  I personally managed to visit the Yujin Robot production line and the head office in Seoul, I am attaching a small report. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/45b/16a/a6d/45b16aa6da674fcaf2f284de3d71faaf.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d16/731/622/d16731622aa986a0bb7f8a5254302d6e.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Unlike most other companies that produce robots for vacuum cleaners, Yujin Robot did not transfer its production to China, but located near the head office in Seoul.  Seoul is a metropolis and the main business center of South Korea.  All the streets are full of bright advertisements of famous Korean brands on numerous skyscrapers: Samsung (perhaps brand # 1 in Korea), LG, Hyundai and others.  The population density per unit area is quite high, even late in the evening on the main streets it is not possible to overcrow (for example, on the streets of the Gangnam district, about which there is a well-known well-known song Gangnam Style). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4d5/ce7/23a/4d5ce723a97d818a9c5f4e9af0dfde11.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Generally speaking, there are still all a lot of fans of the singer Psy, and at the slightest opportunity everyone dances to the fiery rhythm of the song.

On the lower floor there is a team of developers and technical specialists, a testing department, test sites and automated systems for conducting tests, as well as a museum of past and current developments.  By the way, Yujin Robot does not pay for the rent of these floors, because in Korea it is customary not only to rent offices, but to buy out the area forever, like our apartments.  Yujin bought two floors of a business center. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8d8/5ca/96d/8d85ca96dc5e96d4e23665a21f28eb81.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the top floor - sales, programmers, marketers, management. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d1f/073/e03/d1f073e038debc3aff0255040b49dcea.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Today, the company is investing its main forces in the development and production of iClebo robotic vacuum cleaners, as the most sought-after and promising area (although Yujin also produces various production lines and manipulators on request).  Current models of Yujin Robot robot vacuum cleaners at the time of this writing: <a href="http://iclebo.com.ru/iclebo_arte">iClebo Arte</a> (a robot with a room map system) and <a href="http://iclebo.com.ru/iclebo_pop">iClebo Pop</a> (a younger brother without a camera, an odometer, a gyroscope and a cleaning timer). <br><br>  The very same factory and warehouse are located in the suburb of Seoul - Bucheon, in the technopark zone, where different technology companies of South Korea are concentrated (something similar to our Skolkovo).  In one of the technopark buildings there is a production line and a warehouse Yujin Robot.  To the left of the main entrance, there is a shipping area where you can fit a truck and load pallets with robots.  Yujin occupies several floors of a technopark. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4ef/5d0/1fa/4ef5d01fa613f88781fff66194c330b6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Before entering the technopark: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c59/9c3/2ea/c599c32eaf2766aea4e594b0271b0568.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Several Korean companies are represented in the technology park, all of which are engaged in the production of robots (both domestic and industrial).  Below is a museum in which robots of RoboPark companies are exhibited. <br><br>  Next to humanoid robots, <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0a2/600/4b7/0a26004b7659b8e1f3eaf2bcea1b6615.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  golfers <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d6f/762/11c/d6f76211c833e381336febcd619f6b8e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Hyunday booth with industrial robots <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f4c/84e/cc2/f4c84ecc22a32c727176aa4180d1d8fb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  as well as the robot for the education of children iRobiQ from the company Yujin Robot (quite popular in Korea, but not sold in Russia). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0f3/7e8/3a0/0f37e83a036d2867fd981e73c84c03a6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Korean children are sometimes so incomprehensible: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/381/716/583/3817165830a016808ca789e0629cb665.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And Asian manufacturers also like to try something like this, like, for example, to put a mother-of-pearl pattern on the lid of the robot (the pattern material is seashells): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/935/d2d/5a6/935d2d5a65a96337dbd80dccf807516f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Go ahead, directly to the factory.  Outsiders (such as me) should always change their shoes in rubber slippers.  For regular employees, there are rules on the wall.  Women, for example, cannot wear long hair, so if you are a lover of long hair, then this job is not for you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d83/f49/409/d83f49409f168155357fb2c5a14006f0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  All employees are grounded and wear gloves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/43d/aef/624/43daef6248d1aa5a7914e7e6ab18d143.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We enter the room, we have a production line. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e88/6e9/a9e/e886e9a9e5ac27903cb6237c7848652a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At each stage, a factory employee performs only his work, for example, an employee (the majority of production line employees are women) gets a robot at this assembly stage: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f2b/038/b01/f2b038b01cc797308926cf41c560753d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Its task is to fasten the motherboard.  The task of the next employee is to connect all the wires to the connectors on the motherboard.  All stages of assembly are divided into very small steps.  This approach allows to increase the accuracy and build quality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6a6/942/aeb/6a6942aeb6a18ad2267d005c9149c08e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/987/297/fe7/987297fe704ea97f41d349cf77b166b6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After the assembly process, the robots get to the test site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/811/62d/91f/81162d91f14127e77c2be40c418c4248.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  They are checked twice before packing in a box.  It is mandatory to check every robot (which is not done by many other manufacturers, especially in China).  The percentage of marriage from the factory to strive for zero. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d3f/94e/1b2/d3f94e1b2b1c84b21dab4aeb224a5c35.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  First, the operation of all sensors is checked through the service menu of the robot vacuum cleaner, then the iClebo is driven to various kinds of landfills in order to further check the build quality and device operability. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cc9/4d1/adc/cc94d1adc19c1adc060cbb90549b2882.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After careful inspection and packaging, robots are transferred to the warehouse, where they undergo another quality control.  From each batch of 50 iClebo, 10 vacuum cleaners are selected at random and fully tested again.  If the marriage is not detected, the robots are sent to the dealers, but if the marriage is detected, the whole batch goes for additional testing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ee4/320/1f5/ee43201f53be62904ee4adfb84b21885.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/06f/b91/8ea/06fb918ea64fdce607812df5a2ebfe0b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And here are our robots that will go to Moscow in a few hours.  Perhaps we need to write something nice on our boxes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/26f/03e/1f2/26f03e1f20d5c7dacb0d4951f11f9117.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ea8/de4/e63/ea8de4e635a4ad474f3bd6b839b158be.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If you have additional questions, I will be glad to answer them.  All the best! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/377191/">https://habr.com/ru/post/377191/</a></p>
