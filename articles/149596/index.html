      <br>
      For the search was used dork site: site.com inurl: php <br><br><h5>  Beeline </h5><br>  It's all not so much scary, how much. <br>  But it was the only operator on which the disclosures were found. <br>  Do not be surprised that with them there sql inj, but my hacker skill is not so pumped, that would unleash them. <br><br>  Disclosure ways: <br>  <a href="http://wap.privet.beeline.ru/artist.php%3Fblock_id%3D463%26artist%3D%27">wap.privet.beeline.ru</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/36e/5a0/973/36e5a0973be4edd8fae86d84e6db7b82.png"><br><br>  Uncovering paths # 2 + chopped xss: <br>  <a href="http://wap.privet.beeline.ru/abc.php%3Fblock_id%3D468%26letter%3D%253Ch1%253EXSS%253C/h1%253E%253C!--">wap.privet.beeline.ru</a> <br>  It is cut by the fact that the output function truncates the input data. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a6c/06e/e0a/a6c06ee0a54f2e7c289dca1b321436e8.png"><br><br>  Full xss: <br>  <a href="http://ts.beeline.ru/grouplist.do%3FsearchText%3D%2522%253E%253Ch1%253EXSS%253C/h1%253E%253C!--">ts.beeline.ru</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e2d/95a/072/e2d95a07235b509b760980983801555b.png"><br><br>  Full xss # 2: <br>  <a href="http://signup.beeline.ru/index.php%3Fr%3D%253Ch1%2Bstyle%3D%2522font-size:50px%3B%2522%253E%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582,%2B%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2585%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580!%253C/h1%253E">signup.beeline.ru</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/490/b7e/d5e/490b7ed5ece8bcbe3ba214d8aed077d2.png"><br><br>  What the hell  This is generally a strange thing.  Muscle error is caused by the transfer of Russian characters.  Moreover, judging by the search results, it once worked for a long time normally, but now it has broken. <br><br>  <a href="http://eshop.beeline.ru/search/index.php%3FPAGEN_12%3D2%26q%3D%25D1%2582%25D1%258B%25D1%2586%26where%3Diblock_catalog">eshop.beeline.ru</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/589/de9/42c/589de942ce1a44bf71a435baed8e1cf4.png"><br><br>  At this point I ended up with biline.  Despite the fact that there I found the most, and not turned off the error output, I did not find critical vulnerabilities (at least obvious ones). <br><br><h5>  Megafon </h5><br>  For some reason, I thought that a megaphone should have fewer errors. <br>  And, in part, I was right. <br><br>  For all that you can pops up 500 error, such as <a href="http://chel.shop.megafon.ru/show_addition.php%3Fgid%3D58868">here</a> or <a href="http://moscow.shop.megafon.ru/get_ajax_page.php%3Faction%3Dget_compatible_goods_html%26good_id%3D49023%26good_type_id%3D301%27">here</a> . <br><br>  But then suddenly SQL Injection was found! <br>  For objective reasons, I will not post a link to it, who should find it myself, and in Megafon they are already aware of it.  As evidence, you can only show the following: <br><br>  <a href="http://fy2011.megafon.ru/">http://fy2011.megafon.ru</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/14a/910/1b1/14a9101b1d75f5083d52a301769993cb.png"><br><br>  Shell failed to upload to the server, due to competently set rights, but passwords 111 and 123 are brute force. <br>  But on the site of creators with the rights of no one bother. <br>  And by the way, I was not the first who appeared on their website: D <br><br>  By the way, the creators made a presentation for Skolkovo, which was shown to the President, and they are very <a href="">proud of it</a> . <br>  <a href="http://www.downstream.ru/">www.downstream.ru</a> . <br><br><h5>  Mts </h5><br>  From the very beginning, I wanted to start writing exactly with MTS. <br>  But then everything turned out not as beautiful as it should have been, but I will write more in detail about it. <br><br>  For starters, this is the xss on the store website. <br>  <a href="http://www.shop.mts.ru/phones/detail_3d_player/iframe.php%3Fsearch_key%3D24205%26alter_folder%3D%252Fcatalog%252Fdetail_3d_player%252Fimg%252F24205%2522%253E%253C/script%253E%253Ch1%253EXSS%253C/h1%253E%253C!--">www.shop.mts.ru-</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/acf/d6b/39f/acfd6b39f5b126f6628161d40e2b150e.png"><br><br>  The second was on the wap portal: <br>  <a href="http://pulse.mts.ru/search%3Fq%3D%2522%253E%253Ch1%253EXSS%253C/h1%253E">pulse.mts.ru</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8d7/fd7/c2f/8d7fd7c2f58147eb596da7b8401cff06.png"><br><br>  And then SQL Injection was found <br>  I must say that it did not belong to MTS, it belonged to the Ukrainian supplier of resources for mobile phones. <br>  Server admin, and probably adminit still some Slava and Anton, according to some data found on the site, it seems that Slava is the creator of travel.org.ua. <br><br>  Programmers from the guys came out not very much, because  they didn't seem to know about filtering the input at all, but I would even like to praise them for their server administration skills. <br><br>  Unfortunately, my shell was removed after a few hours, after pouring, but I did not manage to spin the server. <br>  Yes, and I think they would have burned it too. <br><br>  Shell was flooded via video.sport.mts.ru. <br>  Actually for the inability to create users of mysql with limited rights, Glory should be reprimanded. <br>  On his website, connecting to mysql is made with the help of a user with root rights. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  All vulnerabilities are sent to support operators. <br>  Thank you for inspecting the text to the end. <br>  Criticism and indications of errors in the text with pleasure I will accept in HP. <br><br>  Information for admins sites: <br>  remained <br><br>  <a href="http://pulse.mts.ru/search%3Fq%3D%2522%253E%253Ch1%253EXSS%253C/h1%253E">http://pulse.mts.ru</a> (but not for long, I think) <br>  <a href="http://signup.beeline.ru/index.php%3Fr%3D%253Ch1%2Bstyle%3D%2522font-size:50px%3B%2522%253E%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582,%2B%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2585%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580!%253C/h1%253E">http://signup.beeline.ru</a> <br>  <a href="http://eshop.beeline.ru/search/index.php%3FPAGEN_12%3D2%26q%3D%25D1%2582%25D1%258B%25D1%2586%26where%3Diblock_catalog">http://eshop.beeline.ru</a> <br><br>  And to a megaphone, or downstream - change the passwords, otherwise I may not know them alone. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149596/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149596/</a></p>
