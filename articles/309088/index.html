As I wrote <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/308514/">here</a> , I developed a keyboard for people with very severe movement disorders, who can press only one button.  Probably you need to immediately make a reservation that this is not a unique development and such keyboards exist in many operating systems in standard programs of on-screen keyboards.  However, my design includes unique features.  I will tell you about them and how they appeared.  Links to GitHub will be at the end of the post. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/197/f82/e2b/197f82e2b29d4c52baebade4b0096911"><br>  <i>Lina is writing a letter to her father</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Head zero.  Start </h3><br>  Summer 2014  I just <a href="https://www.miloserdie.ru/article/m-ma-mam-mama/">met Linka</a> in the spring, and in the summer (on vacation) I wanted to help her somehow. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">My personal advice and opinion</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  You know, they often say that there is a list of things that should be done at least once in life.  Here, I advise you to go to any boarding school / school for disabled people and see how they live there.  It is hard, but good for the soul.  It will take you a day.  You do not have to, but an experience is very interesting. </div></div><br>  The main thing that we lacked was communication.  Since communication and communication is the basis of everything.  And I decided that Lina would be able to press the <a href="https://www.ablenetinc.com/technology/switches/big-red">button</a> , thank God we buy them in schools.  I saw the selection algorithm in class with Lina.  First, the teacher shows in turn the lines on the paper keyboard from 1-9, the person nods at the right one, then the choice is on the line.  I did the same thing in javascript.

      Summer is over.  I happily dragged the program to school.  Showed the keyboard to Lina and her teacher.  Lina looked at me and began to act up.  I did not take into account one small detail.  What is she baby!  She's a sophomore.  And just like that to master something blinking on the screen with a large number of letters is difficult. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">More imho</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  These children are often called mentally stable, but I argue furiously with such opinions.  Just because if you have lived your 10 years without the opportunity to ask: ‚ÄúWhy is the sky blue?‚Äù, Of course, you will not be a full-fledged person.  For example, even with my ‚Äúlight‚Äù violations, I have difficulties with society, for example, I cannot simply enter into relations with a girl in competitions, with all my virtues and charisma </div></div><br><h3>  Chapter one.  "And if not letters?" </h3><br>  Autumn / winter 2014. We realized that it was too difficult for children to master a letter-shaped set.  Then I gave the opportunity to the teacher to create sets of buttons from whole words or syllables.  At first it was a two-dimensional js array, which was connected to the program by a separate \ &lt;script \&gt;.  Yes, yes, I taught a primary school teacher to write js arrays. <br><br>  Closer to spring, I realized that it was not necessary to do SO.  It is not humane to force teachers to work in one file, when for each lesson you need a new set of buttons.  So the teacher should be given the opportunity to select files with sets.  At the same time somehow get away from cross-browser problems.  I looked at the node-webkit technology.  I stopped at <a href="http://appjs.com/">app.js</a> , as there were ready-made api for choosing files. <br><br>  At the same time I wrote a parsil of files, because it makes the teacher write js painfully severely.  Also added the ability to add pictures to sets. <br><br>  ¬ª <a href="https://github.com/aacidov/DisQwerty-webkit">GitHub node-webkit version</a> .  In the turnip bins for poppy axle, you need to think about how to adjust the work. <br><br>  I‚Äôll put a little tudu in this turnip, I have to deal with the govnokod (I wrote the version for a long time and didn‚Äôt know anything about modularity and OOP), now I‚Äôve discovered it and was horrified. <br><br><h3>  Chapter two  A toy </h3><br>  Spring 2016. Agree to play more pleasant than typing?  I think so too.  Why not combine business with pleasure?  I decided to create a toy for children to master the principle of recruitment in unity3d.  Called it DisCoin.  Everything is very simple.  9 chests, a coin appears on a random chest and you need to select this chest.  Children love to play this game, although it has a very simple design, they enjoy playing it after school while they are waiting for the bus to go home. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/b7iSjc3IBio%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhheMDqOcgiNTp7m4yKctqqdNj-TXQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>After school</i> <br><br>  ¬ª <a href="https://github.com/aacidov/DisCoin">Github repo</a> <br><br>  I will be very happy to help with the design of the game, creating an atmosphere, etc. <br><br><h3>  Chapter Three  Not for kids </h3><br>  Summer 2016. This summer, a girl Sasha from Moscow wrote to me that she wants to try my keyboard.  It turned out that she had a Mac, then I did not have a macbook yet and I sent the girl Sasha an old browser version with a bunch of bugs and lags.  Sasha used it, she did it.  And he and his mother gave me a whole list of bugs and lags.  I realized that I would be more buggy than writing from scratch.  Wrote a good version on browserify.  Almost without bugs, using <a href="https://tech.yandex.ru/predictor/">yandex.predict</a> (thanks to Yandex, the service is cool).  Sasha writes her thoughts for the first time in 17 years, and not through her mother: <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/kmpfV3YHUbM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiNS1lQs3cVvFiNOh6uDCj6gSa-YA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Girl Sasha is typing</i> <br><br>  ¬ª <a href="http://aacidov.ru/DisQwerty">Posted here</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="https://github.com/aacidov/DisQwerty-browser">GitHub browser version</a> <br><br>  - <a href="http://aacidov.ru/">My site.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/309088/">https://habr.com/ru/post/309088/</a></p>
