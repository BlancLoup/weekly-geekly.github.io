  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Online advertising has increased the impact. Expenditures on it in 2009 increased by 50%</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This is stated in the report of the CMO Council.  Experts of the company note that, despite the increasing popularity of Internet sites and the development of new technologies, measuring companies still prefer to use the old methods of measuring the effectiveness of online advertising.  Russian experts are confident that Internet advertising is the only media channel, the return of which can be calculated accurately and quickly. <br>  The CMO Council study involved 650 players in the US online advertising market.  Only 9% of respondents believe that the methods used to measure the effectiveness of advertising on the Internet, can provide reliable information.  This is due to the fact that most researchers in the US continue to use outdated techniques.  64, 6% of them prefer tracking the number of page views and registrations on websites, 58, 4% pay attention to traffic, 45, 2% take into account the position of the Internet resource in the search page.  The study showed that only a small number of agencies engaged in placing advertisements on online sites, take into account when analyzing the impact of advertising such criteria as the number of transactions, new customers and mailing subscriptions. <br>  Russian players in the online advertising market, on the contrary, are confident that modern methods allow us to very accurately assess the effectiveness of advertising placed on the Internet.  Artem Inyutin, CEO of RBC Media, believes that online advertising is much better at counting than other media resources.  ‚ÄúTo calculate the effectiveness of online advertising, all the same methods are used that allow us to judge the effectiveness of advertising in traditional media,‚Äù he says.  - In addition, for the analysis of the effectiveness of using tools that are unique to Internet advertising, for example, counting page views or videos.  The third component that distinguishes online advertising from other media platforms, Mr. Inyutin, called its greater targeting. <br>  A similar point of view is shared by AdWatch CEO Andrey Chernyshov, who is confident that the Internet is the most measurable media platform.  ‚ÄúThere are many tools to evaluate the effectiveness of advertising on the Internet,‚Äù he says.  ‚ÄúThe problem is that not all advertisers know how to use it.‚Äù  Despite the fact that now there are only five or six players on the market, the expert doubts that their number may change.  ‚ÄúDespite the increase in the share of the Internet, the budget remains the same,‚Äù Mr. Chernyshov continues.  ‚ÄúTherefore, most likely, there will be a tendency towards the consolidation of agencies.‚Äù <br>  Sergey Spivak, I-Guru Internet agency's general director, doubts that the Internet sites managed to outperform the traditional media channels.  ‚ÄúNow many advertisers really prefer the Internet to media channels like the press and radio,‚Äù he says.  - However, it is still premature to talk about an increase in budgets by 50% in this segment.  In any case, now, when the planning of many campaigns for spring 2009 has not yet been completed. ‚Äù  According to the expert, the accuracy of tools for analyzing the effectiveness of online campaigns is several times higher than that of traditional media tools. </div>
