  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mikrotik - Pros and Cons</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Periodically on Habrahabr the mention of these routers jumps (mostly they are advised in q &amp; a for questions about choosing a router).  Also in runet there are a lot of resources and topics dedicated to this gland.  But very little information about the pros and cons of this decision.  With this article I want to correct the situation somewhat.  I also hope that the comments will complement me and tell me something new. <br><br>  For starters, you can go to wikipedia <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/MikroTik">ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/MikroTik</a> and find out what <blockquote>  Mikrotƒ´kls Ltd (trademark MikroTik) is a Latvian manufacturer of computer network equipment.  MikroTik develops, installs and sells wired and wireless routers, their operating systems and related equipment.  The company was founded in 1995 with the goal of selling equipment in emerging markets.  In 2007, the company employed more than 70 employees. </blockquote><br>  You can separate the hardware called RouterBoard and the operating system called RouterOS.  In colloquial speech, when they talk about it all, they just say Mikrotik. <br><br>  We now turn to the pros and cons. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>What are the advantages of mikrotik</b>

      <b>1.</b> Cost - there are simply no competitors in its price category. <br><br>  <b>2.</b> Functionality - Compared to Dlink, TP-Link, Zyxell and other ‚Äúhome‚Äù routers, the functionality is huge.  It is necessary to compare more with Cisco, Juniper and other "adult" hardware or with linux or freebsd systems (only network stack).  I see no point in listing, but I can see that you can implement almost any ‚Äúwant‚Äù in network technologies. <br><br>  <b>3.</b> Reliability and stability - if the microtic is configured and tested it will work VERY long and without problems.  Also, the built-in scripting language (with which you can configure all sorts of actions for problems) and WatchDog technology, which saves when the router is hung, are very helpful.  All the problems that I had, arose because of problems with food (a lot and often thunderstorms).  With good grounding and UPS, there are almost no problems.  Although occasionally on forums I hear about bugs and marriages, but I have never come across it myself (except for my crooked hands as a bug). <br><br>  <b>4.</b> Documentation and updates - there is a very detailed official Wikipedia.  All firmware are directly on the site, available for download even without authorization.  Unlike the same Cisco, where a simple update is sometimes a problem (requires the status of a certified specialist or even say that it is only for technical support) <br><br>  <b>5.</b> Unified OS and system configuration - since everywhere RouterOS is used, this allows you to quickly change equipment, restore to new hardware, or simply transfer-advise others how and what to do. <br><br>  <b>6.</b> Scalability - There are offers for almost every segment of small and medium business (I would not recommend it for large).  And if you lack one of the Core-series, for example, you can always deploy RouterOS on a powerful x86 server with the necessary performance. <br><br>  <b>And now you can go to the minuses -</b> <br><br>  <b>1.</b> If you need a truly uninterrupted work, then the microtic is unlikely to suit you.  But this is a completely different level of hardware (several power supplies, backup of everything and everyone, and other joys of life).  However, there are examples of deployments on RouterOS on several x86 servers + VMware Fault Tolerance, and VRRP was not in vain. <br><br>  <b>2.</b> If you need to route more than 10G of traffic every second (yes there is a Core-series, but let's be frank - everything is not smooth on it either). <br><br>  <b>3.</b> When you need encryption according to GOST, or you have dynamic routing on EIGRP, or other joys of Vendor Lock. <br><br>  <b>4.</b> If you do not understand the networks - of course, it is not very difficult to set up a bunch of manuals from the network, but for the average user it is rather time-consuming process. <br><br>  <b>5.</b> If you are a seller of iron - suppose that you are laying a mark-up of 20%.  Then it is more profitable for you to sell the same CISCO than Mikrotik.  Since CISCO is more expensive and accordingly will bring you greater profits. <br><br>  <b>6.</b> If you need an all-in-one device - NAS, torrent-rocking chair, DLNA, coffee maker and everything else, then Mikrotik is hardly suitable for you.  This is exactly the router (although it can be implemented through the built-in virtualization tools, but it will not work very stable) <br>  <i>* there should have been a picture with a trolley of a loaf of bread *</i> <br><br>  <b>7.</b> If you are Richard Stallman or anxious about the GPL.  Because yes.  Break.  RouterOS is based on Linux, but what has been changed and how nobody knows. <br><br>  <b>8. The</b> minus from the user with the Habra expressed by him in one of the posts - <blockquote>  ‚ÄúDrDiza: put customers in the office.  for a small load - the most it.  postvil and forgot.  the disadvantage is that these clients no longer call, because everything works for them.  and I have fewer paid calls. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  <b>9.</b> There is no ‚Äúcorporate‚Äù technical support and guarantees - there is no need for you to replace the piece of iron with a new one within 2 hours.  Or remotely connected configured something.  Either understand yourself or pay freelancers.  In general, there is support, and if you do not need ‚Äúhere and now,‚Äù then it is quite possible for you. <br><br>  <b>10.</b> Small distribution of the brand is a significant minus.  And it is both for consumers and for professionals.  Since RouterOS is poorly distributed, the demand for specialists who understand it is small.  The same for companies - if your network is built on this OS and then your system administrator is gone, it will be more difficult for you to find a specialist who would understand this issue.  Yes, and far from major cities to find routers Mikrotik sometimes quite a big problem <br><br>  That's probably all, waiting for your comments, questions and additions. <br><br>  PS: Dear habra users, if you compare iron, let's compare at least approximately comparable at the price - it is not necessary to compare a piece of iron for 3000 rubles and a piece of iron for 3000 dollars :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/185230/">https://habr.com/ru/post/185230/</a></p>
