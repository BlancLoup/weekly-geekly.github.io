The law of three percent</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  <em>I know that writing this post, I will not become Paisiy Svyatogorts.</em>  <em>However, I hope there will be at least one reader who may understand what a thrill it is to be a teacher (mentor) in IT.</em>  <em>And our country will be a little better.</em>  <em>And this reader (who understands) will be a little happier.</em>  <em>Then this text is not written in vain.</em> </p><br><p>  I am a part-time teacher.  And for a long time.  Seven or eight years.  And I'm not ashamed. <br>  Current exhaust: more than 20 employed children, who were engaged in a tete-a-tete.  I know not much.  Could be more ... Guys do not complain yet (I lie, of course they complain, but they all have - ok).  In my defense, I will say that there is still an unknown number of “streaming” students to whom my subject was useful, but with which I didn’t work tête-à-tête and didn’t train ... </p><br><p>  I heard a huge number of times: “you are a freak”, “oh why are you messing around with these students”, “they look into your mouth and you compensate ... well, you compensate something, in short,” what did you find in this Kate?  Is she your mistress? ”“ What did you find in this Vasya?  Is he your brother? ”,“ There is nothing to do? ”,“ You have a wife, daughter and mortgage! ”,“ Are you a drug addict ”,“ Do you have a lot of free time? ”,“ It would be better if I looked at the Game of Thrones , uncle "... And so on.  If I loved the work of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxxxymiron">Oxxxymeron</a> and consulted Miron (personally, alas, I am not familiar with it), then <a href="https://music.yandex.ru/album/3087311/track/34942409">“Where we are not”</a> could be made up of these phrases and revolutions ... And then it would be a bomb! .. Oh, what a cool repchik would have turned out ... </p><br><p>  I'm tired of explaining.  As if I was “making excuses.”  It's funny even.  I am writing this post the next time they call it a “freak”, I’ll just give a link to this opus. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="schastlivye-vs-chiefulnutye-ekonomika-radosti">  Happy VS ChefUlnutye.  Economy of joy </h2><br><p>  So, <strong>mentoring</strong> (they also say “mentoring”, but why if there is a domestic analogue? We will have speech import substitution) - this is a special case of the <em>“economy of happiness”</em> .  And this term is not mine, there are timid academic studies devoted to this topic and even <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D1%2581%25D1%2587%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C%25D1%258F">an article on Wikipedia</a> ... In my opinion, the economy of happiness is an unsuccessful term and it is better to say economy of joy.  Because “happiness” is already beginning to be confused with what I call chieful (from English “cheerful”) and, unfortunately, many do not see the difference between happy and choufulnutymi ... It’s about the same thing as mixing the concepts of “love” and “ sex " <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8">in the 60s</a> .  They intersect, but are not identical.  But this is a separate issue.  My post - my rules.  I will say <strong>"economy of joy"</strong> </p><br><p>  To be rude, for the entire era of the existence of the human race, there have always been three economies in all countries and cultures: </p><br><ol><li>  needs economy </li><li>  economy of pleasure </li><li>  economy of joy. </li></ol><br><p>  Yes, there were not always strict boundaries between them.  But if modern economics has sufficiently dismantled the <em>economy of needs</em> and the <em>economy of pleasures</em> , then for some reason she called the <em>economy of joy</em> “the new movement of economic thought”. </p><br><p>  Sorry, but quote from <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0_%25D0%2595%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0">Ecclesiastes</a> : </p><br><blockquote>  Sometimes they say something: look, this is news! <br>  And it was already in the centuries that have passed before us. <br>  They do not remember the former - and that will be, - Those who will be later will not remember him. </blockquote><p>  Thanks for reading.  At this insidious religious propaganda over.  No more - I promise. </p><br><h2 id="komfort-toska-radost">  Comfort, longing, joy </h2><br><p>  I think the twentieth century is to blame.  And all the Bolsheviks there, and opponents of the Bolsheviks.  And after the Second World War in general, all the regimes went crazy ... For some reason, everyone believed that if we eat tasty food and improve the standard of living, universal happiness will come.  Please note that, in this particular paradigm, both are hegemonic, and the USSR and the United States have been on the same foot.  But something like that happiness did not come. </p><br><p>  Here are two friends I have.  Both have an average salary of more than 600 thousand.  (per month).  So, with the first one I was boozing and the second was boozing.  One generally lives in hell.  The second - somehow mediocre ... Ie  Money to ass - and there is no joy. </p><br><p>  No joy for men! </p><br><p>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2583,_%25D0%2590%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2585%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC_%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B4">Abraham Maslow's</a> <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2583">pyramid</a> as a <em>universal</em> paradigm of human needs - a rare nonsense!  I will not speak for the whole world, but it definitely does not suit the Russian.  The Russians should have their own pyramid ... And at the very bottom there should be a "pathos from being."  Russians love pathos.  No pathos - no life.  Such we are, and it does not fix it.  Give us great goals, good and strong.  Some, not the best representatives of our civilization, are not necessarily good; ... but strong, in a big way! .. so that uuuh! </p><br><p>  That is, we have a foundation - <strong>“self-actualization” (“self-actualization”)</strong> , and not a little havchik.  But Abraham Samuilovich's “self-actualization” is the very top….  This is how it is.  So much for the clue to the "mysterious Russian soul." </p><br><p>  There is such a subtle concept, it is expressed by the word <strong>"longing"</strong> .  Tosca is not a spline, not a melancholy.  This is not a despondency or sadness ... Noooooo! .. Tosca is understandable to those who have Maslow's seventh level lowered to the very foundation.  A person of such a breed (not necessarily Russian) will understand what the word "longing" means.  Others are not. </p><br><p>  How to beat melancholy?  Only the benefits generated by the <strong>economy of joy</strong> .  Other means are not known to me. </p><br><p>  Actually this is the best definition of the economy of joy, allowing it to unambiguously demarcate from the economy of pleasure. </p><br><p>  Self-actualization is a human activity that provides inner satisfaction with the conditions of one’s being, giving fullness and meaningfulness to life, revealing the essence of one’s vocation. </p><br><p>  Thus, the economy of joy is an economic relationship that allows a group of individuals to self-analyze. </p><br><h2 id="zakon-isterlina-easterlin-paradox">  Easterlin Paradox </h2><br><p>  There is a remarkable law formulated by <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD,_%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B4">Richard Easterlin (Richard Easterlin)</a> in 1974 in his article <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2008/04/16/business/Easterlin1974.pdf">“Does it improve the human lot?</a>  <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2008/04/16/business/Easterlin1974.pdf">Some empirical evidance »</a> </p><br><p>  In English literature this law is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easterlin_paradox">Easterlin paradox</a> .  But I, as a person of Russian culture, do not see any paradox ... a completely expected result, simply confirmed by research.  Therefore, I propose to translate into Russian the “Easterlin paradox” as “Easterlin Law” </p><br><blockquote>  The growth of absolute, but not relative, income does not lead to an increase in life satisfaction </blockquote><p>  I translate into understandable patsansky: yes, perhaps there are people who really want Bentley (or what kind of car is fashionable now? I'm a lamer.), Because really car enthusiasts ... but the overwhelming majority want Bentley because it's "cool."  People want to visit Paris, because “to see Paris - and die!”, But they are ashamed to go to <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D1%2585%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4">Ohrid</a> , because this is “pissing Macedonia”.  And do not care that this type of "Slavic Jerusalem" and that every stone there stinked with history.  This is not fashionable - so not cool.  99% of people do not <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D1%258F%25D1%2587%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0-%25D0%2591%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%258F">give a</a> shit that the waters of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D1%258F%25D1%2587%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0-%25D0%2591%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%258F">Bathhouse</a> are as steep as the waters of Karlovy Vary.  But they want it in Karlovy Vary.  Because "cool." </p><br><p>  It is worth noting that Easterlin has already studied a modern society, a society that does not know famine, plague and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%259E%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0">severe wars</a> .  Thus the <em>needs economy</em> has already given the necessary minimum.  <em>The economy of pleasure</em> does not give life satisfaction.  The economy of joy remains. </p><br><h2 id="period-poluraspada-sovetskogo-obrazovaniya">  Half-life of Soviet education </h2><br><p>  Awareness of the importance of the case - a key moment for the economy of joy. <br>  In the conditions of decay of post-post-post-Soviet education (post-Soviet: 1991-2001, post-post-Soviet: 2001-2011, post-post-Soviet: 2011-2021) coaching in IT is incredibly valuable. </p><br><p>  How long will N-post-Soviet education last?  This can be a separate post to write, and here briefly: forever.  It is like nuclear physics: the decay period is infinite ....  Therefore, we should talk about the half-life of our glorious Soviet education.  According to my observations this period is 10 years for Bauman Moscow State Technical University.  We will call this the “half-life of the Baumanka”. </p><br><p> Thus, by 2001, MSTU sank by 1/2, by 2011 by ¾, by 2021 we will increase by 7/8, by 2031 by 15/16…. </p><br><p>  Yes, there are other universities.  A couple of times I was invited to MSU.  There is another system, and according to my unprofessional estimates, the half-life is 20-25 years.  And there are universities with a half-life of 5 years and now there is education at the level of statistical error .... </p><br><h2 id="chastnyy-sluchay-ekonomiki-radosti-nastavnichestvo">  A special case of the economy of joy: mentoring </h2><br><p>  But let's not move away from the topic and go back to mentoring. </p><br><p>  If the <strong>fundamental education</strong> , which in my opinion is important for the arch, is somehow more or less held up, then here is a severe pain with practical knowledge.  I already wrote in the post <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/339208/%255D">“Uneducated youth.</a>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/339208/%255D">The answer of the teacher-part-time "</a> about it.  I will not repeat. </p><br><p>  When you share knowledge yourself you do not lose anything except time.  There is only one question: <em>are you ready to waste your time on this</em> ?  I'm ready.  Because it is like a blood donation.  Sharing knowledge and, especially, experience is great.  It gives an unshakable confidence that your life makes sense.  And confidence in meaningfulness (recall Maslow's “wrong” pyramid for Russians) is the most important thing.  At least for people of my temperament. </p><br><h2 id="zakon-treh-procentov">  Three percent law </h2><br><p>  Once I asked myself a question: how many people have a craving for teaching?  Started asking, talking.  And received a statistical figure: 3%. </p><br><p>  A three percent estimate is purely empirical.  There is no evidence or explanation for this phenomenon.  Also, I would not venture to suggest how this figure will change if the sample is changed.  For example, instead of IT, take another area.  Or leave IT, but test this observation on the Chinese, Americans, Brazilians?  Or among all the IT-Schnick take only pythonists? </p><br><p>  This law is derived solely on a sample of my environment and any generalizations are at your own risk. </p><br><p>  Is it a lot or a little?  I believe that in the scale of Russia - this is a lot.  All that needs to be done by the university bureaucracy is to realize that the time of these people is expensive, free them from stupid unnecessary paperwork, give a convenient time (morning and / or evening or Saturday for unmarried) - and profit! </p><br><p>  There are no problems to give students current and cool knowledge.  You just need to look for teachers from the industry.  For 100 professionals we get an average of 3 teachers.  Search, search, search!  By the way, if you suddenly enter this 3% and IT person, write to me in a personal.  We will be friends, cooperate and jointly “self-actualize” (And if you are still from Information Security, that’s just great. I’m especially keenly looking for virologists and pentesters) </p><br><h2 id="zaklyuchenie">  Conclusion </h2><br><p>  Everyone must decide for himself how to get the benefits from the "economy of joy".  IT coaching is just one example.  Yes, not everyone can.  There are people who are simply not predisposed to this ... I don’t know how to dance, but there are people who are great professionals but cannot teach. </p><br><p>  What can I say, find something else: you can donate blood, or donate regularly to charity.  Only donate well, so it was a pity.  So if you tell your wife, you will get a skillet on the head.  Then it works. </p><br><p>  I have another acquaintance - for the sake of the “economy of joy,” he programmed various programs for funds and fundraising.  Cool man.  Respect. </p><br><p>  A lot of things you can do.  For example, you can simply organize information (telegram channels).  You can write cool posts on Habré.  Collect really cool IT books and donate to your alma mater.  Yes, dofiga everything can be done.  And very small forces.  Stop wasting your leisure on the Game of Thrones.  Find a useful thing.  And life will score the key. </p><br><p>  In short, IT-shniki.  Be people.  Live easier.  I wish you had enough money.  And time too.  Find your joy economy case.  Joy to you! </p></div>
