And some of the major brands even managed to establish themselves as ‚Äúeternal experimenters‚Äù.  For example, the same ASUS. <br><br>  There are a little less daring (or a little more cautious - somehow) companies that sometimes surprise.  At the end of last year, Lenovo managed to do this by introducing the Yoga Tablet, a tablet with a hinged support. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Lenovo Yoga Tablet appeared quite unexpectedly (note Samsung and Apple!).  No leaks, no drunken spree in bars.  Simple: they took and announced.  The people did not expect such a surprise and remained in a slight bewilderment.  Well, when Ashton Kutcher was introduced as a new engineer from Lenovo, there were a couple of thousand more bile pills in the world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9af/9e0/9d7/9af9e09d70d5ee95f0fbdffd7d1af97a.png"><br><br>  However, if with Kutcher everything is clear and Lenovo marketers can safely put the ‚Äúfive‚Äù for such a find, then the Yoga Tablet (by the way, not the most euphonic name for the Russian ear - it turns out that something like ‚Äúyogatetebit‚Äù) should be considered closer. <br><br>  We begin, however, with a small digression.  Six months ago, a Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga transformer appeared in Russia, a solution whose uniqueness lay in patented hinges.  As befits a real yoga, the gadget is ready to accept one of four asanas without any warm-up: the user can use IdeaPad Yoga as a laptop, tablet, ‚Äústand‚Äù or ‚Äútent‚Äù.  If with real-world applicability the first two questions do not arise (yes, the buttons in the tablet mode do not work - everything is fine), then the other two ... In fact, this is one of the types of marketing entertainment, but, in principle, someone when somewhere it uses both the ‚Äústand‚Äù and the ‚Äútent‚Äù (to surprise a client, by the way, is also worth a lot).  Be that as it may, the device turned out to be interesting and rather popular (we will leave the price issues beyond the scope of this article).  By the way, the second ‚Äúyogi‚Äù has already appeared on the store shelves - naturally, better, faster, etc. <br><br>  We return to the hero of our testing.  Yoga Tablet was presented in two versions - with a screen diagonal of 8 and 10 inches.  To us on the test got a ‚Äúten-inch‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d01/9db/a29/d019dba29e40f57863c1ed529e66b1b2.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/541/338/e14/541338e144eacab29dca8857b25994c2.png"><br><br>  <b>ATTENTION SPOILER !!!</b>  <b>For those who like numbers, immediately list the main parameters:</b> <b><br></b> <br>  <i>Screen: 10 '', 1280x800</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Processor: MediaTek MT8125 1.2 GHz (4 cores)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>RAM: 1 GB</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Memory: 16 GB + microSD</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Camera: 5 / 1.6 MP</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Battery: 9000 mAh</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Weight: 603 g</i> <i><br></i> <br>  The characteristic thickening of one of the long sides of Tablet Yoga immediately catches the eye - it is in this block that the whole power of the gadget lies.  Evil tongues, as usual, claim that the idea is lapped up and everything came up with before Lenovo.  Indeed, the Yoga Tablet has, for example, some similarities with the Sony Tablet S or the SUPRA M127G.  But only a similarity.  But in the profile of the tablet from Lenovo really strongly resembles the keyboard for Mac - here you can not argue. <br><br>  Due to the thickening of the Yoga Tablet, it lies comfortably in your hand (by the way, the ‚Äúbook‚Äù is the first use of the gadget).  Feelings are different from those when holding a regular tablet, for the better.  By the way, due to the unusual design, it was possible to reduce the overall thickness - it makes no sense to talk about ‚Äúat least 3 millimeters‚Äù, and they are quite happy with 8 mm.  Well, finally, the main secret: they placed a 9000 mAh battery inside a cylindrical bulge - the device keeps afloat for a very long time.  The manufacturer says about 18 hours, but since the parameters are extensible, let's say that, depending on the usage scenario, this figure can either be reduced to 7-8 hours with active use, or grow to several days with periodic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1b9/b8b/6a8/1b9b8b6a8c18b35173ce56f747ef6714.png"><br><br>  And that is not all.  With a flick of the wrist, if you practice it beforehand, the metal stop leans back.  Thanks to the aluminum ‚Äúfoot‚Äù, the tablet is in an ideal position for typing: at Lenovo, this mode of use is called simply ‚Äúthe keyboard‚Äù.  The stop is fixed quite securely, and in order to turn it you will need a knack. <br><br>  Finally, in the ‚Äúconsole‚Äù mode, simply flip the tablet (with the support folded down) and we will get a great option for watching the video.  The tilt angle is adjustable.  True, it is better not to reach the maximum - the tablet can tip over. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/287/dd6/e15/287dd6e15a0c1fe150042cdb5387dd55.png"><br><br>  Kohl started talking about watching the video, we immediately notice that the Yoga Tablet screen is bright and has good viewing angles.  But along with this - weak resolution.  After modern HD displays, and especially Retina screens, 1280x800 look like yesterday afternoon.  First disappointment. <br><br>  Alas, there is the second.  Inside the quad processor from MediaTek (for fans of ‚Äúinfoporno‚Äù - MT8125 1.2 GHz).  But - the budget series.  The system, judging by the indications of benchmarks, is below average.  If you use a daily set of applications - mail, browser, video, music, light toys - you will hardly notice jerking and pauses.  But it is worth running something resource-intensive and ... put out the light!  In the eighth Asphalt to play or watch ‚Äúraw‚Äù, the uncompressed video will have to be on something else. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e63/872/389/e6387238999474bd519b60c2c9917863.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/62e/879/78b/62e87978b6beb6e2fe14ef538c24f175.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e56/3de/0a1/e563de0a194dc8fcff56f52a1515ac78.png"><br><br>  For the Yoga Tablet, Lenovo rendered its own interface.  To our taste - neutral.  You can, of course, speculate about the ‚Äúnon-curvature‚Äù of icons, or the lack of an application menu (yes, yes, all new applications ‚Äúsypyats‚Äù directly on one of the screens - the scheme is similar to iOS), but, in general, this should not spoil the mood of the newly-minted tablet owner. <br><br>  We add that the tablet is equipped with two stereo speakers, whose settings can be changed within known limits using the Dolby application (the key word is ‚Äúwithin known limits‚Äù).  The volume buttons are a bit small - most likely, you will periodically miss. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0f0/b71/ae8/0f0b71ae861757b04e3410c6f1d3bf97.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/343/b79/44f/343b7944f18d64cdf8ddaf96ff59c16a.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/93b/091/3c2/93b0913c2661361f22580293998d14f9.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a7c/85c/ba8/a7c85cba8d4f86b77d8d69a9a8e370ba.png"><br><br>  Under the reclining support hides the slot under the microSD.  There should be a hole for the SIM card nearby, but since we tested the Wi-FI version, you will see only a technological groove in the photo. <br><br>  Something forgot ... Oh, yes, built-in cameras.  Indeed, no wonder to forget.  No alien technology, conventional sensors 5 and 1.6 MP.  If only the original camera is placed: when using the ‚Äúconsole‚Äù mode (for example, for Skype video calls), the front camera is to the left of the screen, and the main one - in the ‚Äúkeyboard‚Äù or ‚Äúconsole‚Äù modes - looks somewhere in the table.  However, the developers immediately give a recommendation - ‚ÄúFor your photo effects when shooting, please avoid opening the external bracket‚Äù (spelling and punctuation of the original are preserved). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/830/ddc/23a/830ddc23acdc36b4d830901c24086411.png"><br><br>  <b>In total</b> <br>  As experts say, Lenovo Yoga Tablet turned out to be a controversial device.  On the one hand, its form factor is unusual.  But comfortable.  And for sure will appeal to those who do not part with the tablet.  Materials and assembly - we would put a solid "four".  But for the screen and performance assessment will have to be reduced to ‚Äúsatisfactory‚Äù. <br><br>  Let's just say: in our area this bird is rare and not everyone can tame it.  But given the fact that the price of a ten-inch Yoga Tablet ranges from 12 to 14 thousand, i.e.  does not go beyond the ‚Äúneed to think‚Äù category - a tablet may well decorate your personal or family gadget park. <br><br>  Note in small print: 1) if you are too lazy to read all these 8400 characters (with spaces);  2) if you need to consolidate the read - <a href="http://bit.ly/GTF_YouTube">watch our video</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/209808/">https://habr.com/ru/post/209808/</a></p>
