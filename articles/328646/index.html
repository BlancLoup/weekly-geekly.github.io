  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Offline promotion of the personnel monitoring system: personal experience</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Product promotion is quite an interesting process, in which it is difficult to guess what exactly ‚Äúshoots‚Äù and what will turn out to be empty.  For example, offline marketing.  Immediately say that it will bring a company that is developing cloud solutions is almost impossible.  After all, StaffCounter is a system for monitoring staff working in Linux and Windows.  That is, the work of our clients is directly related to computers and the Internet.  And this means that potential clients must also search for us on the net.  But we still decided to try. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  A little bit about offline promotion </h3><br>  In general, the term offline promotion appeared relatively recently.  He was required in order to somehow distinguish between advertising activities on the Internet and offline.  Now to the offline promotion can be attributed all those methods that have used before: advertising on radio and TV, billboards, flyers, banners, participation in exhibitions and other events. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/0e1/e01/4e3/0e1e014e373f4311851058163da3398d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  All advertising that is published and distributed outside the Internet, obviously costs more.  As for efficiency, then the question is in the target audience and, of course, coverage of the territory.  We decided to try three ways, combining them into one marketing campaign, namely: printed advertising brochures, prepared a roll-up, which was presented at two seminars on marketing and business.

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

    <h3>  Little about prices </h3><br>  Our goal was to try offline promotion of staff monitoring on Linux and Windows in the local market.  Therefore, for a start, we printed 1000 triklets (A4 format in three additions).  Non-urgent printing (a week of waiting) in a printing press on glossy paper cost us 60 euros. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/299/0d4/60e/2990d460e251492cb3ef82bf6fc81620.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  Informative rollap was prepared by our employee, and high-quality printing and fastening cost 30 euros. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/faf/9bd/bb8/faf9bdbb870645cc8950a22d95adca76.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Then it was the most difficult - to choose an event with a target audience, where you could distribute our advertising products and get feedback.  From the closest in our city were conferences organized by the School of Business Communication.  Namely, Mikhail Galeichenko's seminar on business automation and a two-day forum for businessmen of the Business Development Sales &amp; Marketing Forum.  One way or another, but our product for staff time and productivity was very much in the subject. <br><br>  The distribution of leaflets among the participants of these two events and the installation of a roll-up in the venue cost us another 200 euros. <br><br>  Next is simple arithmetic: 60 + 30 + 200 + = 290 euro for a small offline campaign to promote the personnel monitoring system.  Is it a lot or a little?  The question remains open. <br><br><h3>  Little about the results </h3><br>  To be frank, we did not expect a huge flow of customers.  Moreover, it was the first time when we really declared ourselves in Moldova.  People need time to get used to a new brand.  However, despite all these conditions, about a week after the forum, a representative of a company engaged in logistics called us.  He immediately said that he saw our brochure at the training and became interested. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/053/9e3/003/0539e30036e34512ad06acddc38cef62.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  His company decided to use our product, or rather its cloud version.  Staff monitoring for Linux and Windows StaffCounter is great for solving personnel management issues in a logistics company, allowing you to track productivity, discipline and protect inside information from detractors and insiders. <br><br>  Summing up, we can say that the experience of offline promotion of the personnel monitoring and time tracking program at least paid for itself.  And if we consider that in the future other participants of business seminars can turn to us, then all this was certainly not in vain. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/328646/">https://habr.com/ru/post/328646/</a></p>
