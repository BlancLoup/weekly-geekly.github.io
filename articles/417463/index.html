  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Unexpected meeting. Chapter 17</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Spacecraft series "Daona" had a relatively small size.  The series was young and still aroused genuine interest among the military space fleet of the Union of Central Worlds, but access to the management of this transport was very limited.  Designed primarily for solving problems of governmental significance, ships were usually used as fast couriers, providing transportation of information or people.  ‚ÄúDona‚Äù had a successful and very dense arrangement of equipment and were equipped with the most advanced solutions in power supply, engine building and ship control.  These ships very quickly accelerated and spent a little less time jumping through hyperspace.  But, despite the presence of compact and powerful power sources, almost all the representatives of this series had very weak weapons and a limited space of transport compartments and residential areas.  The AI, in comparison with others, had a little more freedom of action, helping to control the ship, however, after the global war with AI, it was regarded more as a minus than a plus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d64/b1e/012/d64b1e0123e642e9b9b61ac800aabcf8.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Comment from the author and abstract</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>Comment on the author.</b> <br>  An unexpected meeting is my experimental literary project.  The project is based on my reflections on the model of controlled development of civilization, ideas about future technological advances, as well as some reflections on scientific and technical progress, its role and implications for the development of human civilization.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe book originated in 2013-2014, but only at the end of 2015 I had free time and I was able to start working on it.  Initially, a series of separate stories was planned, but in the process of creating a single universe for stories, I preferred to try to write a whole science fiction work. <br><br>  <b>Annotation.</b> <br>  Two former graduates of the Academy of the Space Fleet, who have not seen each other for a long time, unexpectedly meet on a cargo ship.  Both are working on the task of providing support ship cargo.  However, after the almost completed regular inspection of the ship and the cargo on it, events occur that prevent further divergence of their life paths.  In an atmosphere of mutual distrust, heroes have to figure out what is happening and look for solutions to emerging problems.  After the overall situation on the ship becomes clear, there is another unexpected encounter that not only has a strong influence on the future of both heroes, but also triggers larger-scale events in the worlds inhabited by people. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">For those who read for the first time or read a long time ago: decoding used abbreviations</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  VKF - Military Space Fleet <br>  ZKP - Spare Command Point <br>  AI - Artificial Intelligence <br>  KIRP - Kinetic Induction Rotary Gun <br>  NBS - NeuroBiosystem (corporation in SPM) <br>  Security Center of CMS - Security Service of CMS <br>  SCM - Union of Central Worlds <br>  FIPI - Physio-Intellectual-Psychological Index (person) <br>  CCTS - Central Command Telemetry System <br>  TSUK - Ship Control Center <br>  EMIG - Electromagnetic Pulsed Grenade <br></div></div><br>  Three people are located in the cabin of the ship.  The cabin of the company, like everything on this ship, was not large, however, it created a certain feeling of comfort, despite the asceticism of its situation.  In the corners of the room, holograms of plants ‚Äúgrew up‚Äù from the walls, and the walls themselves created a realistic feeling of finishing with a light and soft-looking material with a low-key embossed pattern.  The walls could be turned into any panorama that exists in the ship‚Äôs memory, but the owner of the ship vyryl exactly the kind that was now.  A dark brown shelf was put out of the wall opposite the entrance, which was in harmony with the general style of the entire room, probably primarily because of the peculiar interweaving of patterns on the wall near this improvised table.  Along the opposite walls, perpendicular to the entrance, soft sofas securely attached to the floor were located.  Lex and Laer sat in different corners of one sofa, Zarkon located in the corner of the opposite.

      ‚ÄúI assumed that we would immediately leave this ship and transfer to mine.‚Äù  However, some people, - Zarkon reproachfully looked at Lex, - rudely broke the control of all the ship's locks.  So now we are a little stuck here, so I suggest that you spend the rest of today and devote a couple of evenings to philosophical conversations, from which you will receive complete answers to your questions.  And to devote free time from these conversations to restoring the regular work of several gateways and main lines of communication to the ship's CCTS to return access to it in the minimum amount. <br><br>  ‚ÄúTo exit, it‚Äôs enough to restore access to one gateway,‚Äù Laera objected. <br><br>  - For our release - quite.  But the repair team will arrive on the ship and it should at least normally get on the ship.  You are not going to throw a fully functional ship? <br><br>  ‚ÄúWell, I'll help you quickly restore the minimum necessary access,‚Äù Lex agreed.  He really did not want to throw the ship into which he had invested so much power and which could be restored with minimal effort. <br><br>  - Will the ship become the property of the Order?  - asked Laer. <br><br>  The keeper nodded. <br><br>  - This is how the Order fleet is being replenished?  - followed by the next question. <br><br>  - The main fleet of the Order consists of custom ships, which undergo periodic modernization according to our technologies. <br><br>  - But in this case it is not a custom ship? <br><br>  Zarkon shrugged and immediately seized the initiative in conversation. <br><br>  - All of our initially complicated relationships were provoked by a simulated sound effects simulator.  Lex, remember, it all started with an explosion that was heard, after which your reflexes worked, and I had to respond.  With the advent of, - the keeper looked at the girl, - Laera, the situation has worsened so much that I was already openly hot.  I must say that in recent years I have not been in a similar situation like this three hundred. <br><br>  Lex and Laer looked at each other.  Three hundred!  How old is he? <br><br>  - So, just wondering who of you set up a pretty good set of imitators? <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhen the attack occurred, it was necessary to report the situation, but I could not access the ship‚Äôs communications and we decided to use the government courier's hyperlink complex.  I deployed the effectors to distract the attackers and gain time for our departure after the transfer of information.  The program was a one-time, perhaps one of the blocks was configured somehow differently or damaged during the shelling of the room, which led to its false triggering. <br><br>  ‚ÄúRandom factor,‚Äù the keeper smiled. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMaybe not,‚Äù Laera objected and tried to return the conversation to a more convenient direction for her, roughly pressing Zarcon, ‚Äúif someone tells you where the pirates came from.‚Äù  The crew of the ship, by the way, paid for it with their lives.  I knew the captain personally. <br><br>  - The development of the whole operation involved clergymen.  Hmm, - the keeper hesitated, - here you just can‚Äôt explain everything.  I propose to start from the beginning. <br><br>  Zarkon slyly glanced at the people sitting opposite him and asked a question. <br><br>  - You do not notice in the development of mankind some oddities? <br><br>  The man and the woman, who did not expect such a turn in conversation, thought a little. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYou know a little more than the ordinary inhabitants of hundreds of worlds.‚Äù  Mankind has achieved such heights!  We can overcome trillions of kilometers in some weeks.  For us, there are no special problems for intraplanetary routes without the use of hyper drives.  Of course, at reasonable distances, however, they allow every central world to have a rather impressive space infrastructure.  The mastery of hyperlinks allowed to dramatically expand the operational information space of mankind.  The Union of Central Worlds in the information space seemed to shrink, the world became as if closer and more holistic, although the systems are also at a very impressive distance from each other.  Neural networks have fantastically expanded our capabilities.  However, the old people command the control of such complex systems as spacecraft - mental dialogues with the artificial intelligence of a ship somehow do not strongly convince of its intelligence.  And all this with the presence of neural networks, which at first glance are ideally designed for a harmonious and inconspicuous laying between the human brain and the electronic equipment of the ship.  The ship should be just another implant, and not something separate from the person.  Neural networks provide virtually unlimited control not only over the human body, its chemistry, reaction, but also essentially its brain.  There is such a wide and attractive field of possibilities for managing public consciousness, but this is not even the case in the Periphery.  All this, it would seem, lies before us, but no one uses it.  Do not you think this is somewhat strange?  We have achieved quite significant successes in bionics, but we do not possess consciousness in a pure electronic form.  The NBS makes very complex systems that interact with the human brain directly, but people still cannot solve the problem of long-lasting virtual or at least qualitative augmented reality.  Mankind has clung to the immutability of its DNA, although give up on this and open up just exciting prospects. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThere are logical explanations for this,‚Äù said Lex.  - We do not have a strong AI, because humanity has already learned its lesson in Taurank.  Very expensive lesson.  It is logical that the work in this area has been completely curtailed and a strong AI is simply not developed.  Large corporations understand not only responsibility, but also fear punishment for the like from any public entity, whether it is SPM or Periphery.  Small organizations cannot develop anything wisely sensible due to the limitations of their resources.  Limiting the capabilities of AI is a perceived step of humanity, and not its impossibility to solve this problem.  And neural networks - Lex shrugged - they resist external control.  The reason for the resistance is not completely clear, but, it seems, I heard that this is more an architectural limitation of neural networks than some kind of natural limitation.  So historically.  And no one is eager to change something, since the development of a new architecture will last for centuries, if not for millennia.  Yes, we are lucky that it all happened that way.  As far as I know, we are not the first space civilization.  And if the past civilizations had no luck, then should someone have been lucky once?  Why not us? <br><br>  - You are a wagon, you should know exactly what happened in Taurank.  - The keeper slyly looked at Lex. <br><br>  - Yes I know.  Tactics and strategy of mankind in the chronicles of the ACF is somewhat different from the widely known.  But this does not change the essence. <br><br>  - What if I say that there is not only a public version, but also a version for generalists? <br><br>  Lex, who admits this, did not mind. <br><br>  ‚ÄúLex, do you remember our past conversation well?‚Äù  Laer, I asked to carefully read it. <br><br>  Interlocutors guardian nodded at the same time. <br><br>  - Good.  In this case, you should be well aware that I have a rather deep understanding of neural network specifics.  In my absence, you talked to each other and probably noticed that I am also well versed in technology and politics.  I am the head of the Order of the Guardians, in our terminology - the first coordinator.  The entire first level of the Order submits to me directly.  And each of these people can easily become the second coordinator, and after a while the first one.  And at the moments of these changes, the Order will not lose the effectiveness of its work.  Each person of the first level as a whole is similar to me in the breadth of coverage and depth of knowledge, only the scale of work differs, but, as you understand, with the right selection of personnel this is only a temporary problem.  Multiply all this to a higher level of technology and what will we get? <br><br>  - The structure that will seek to manage?  Said Laer half inquiringly. <br><br>  - But this is logical? <br><br>  ‚ÄúQuite,‚Äù the woman agreed. <br><br>  - Any management has well-defined goals.  At any level of influence, the current control system tries to save itself by almost any means.  This behavior is relatively easy to simulate and explainable, if you start to consider it as a kind of living organism.  An organism that simply lives and, in moments of danger to its existence, does something to live on.  To predict the behavior of a small organism requires a very detailed study of it, but further, as it grows, this requirement is somewhat reduced, and not at the expense of the quality of the prediction.  For example, it is somewhat more difficult to predict a detailed reaction to an event of an individual on the surface of the planet than the reaction of the planet as a whole. <br><br>  The keeper paused, looking attentively at the faces of the people sitting in front of him. <br><br>  - So, back to the goals.  Order collects the necessary statistics on all human worlds.  However, we should not think that we just need to enter a data set into a supercomputer, which will give some result, what to do next.  Although I will not deny that we have such a calculator.  But we also have to "play" at different levels: tack on politics and keep our people in the right positions, maintain and develop the material and technical base, and therefore solve not only technical, but also economic tasks.  It is necessary to develop a network of data collection, but in order to do this imperceptibly, it is necessary to make considerable efforts.  To maintain technical superiority, it is necessary to conduct your research or organize them on the available resources of the worlds, moreover, so that no one suspects anything.  All this requires effort and attention, but can be solved at the level of organization of the Order.  And the motivations of the people who work in it.  It is rather easy to motivate the lower level of management and direct performers, for example, by paying for their services or by improving the quality of life, this is especially effective for the periphery.  At the same time, we risk little, because even if we shake out information from people, which is usually non-critical, it will be almost impossible to put all the pieces of the puzzle, which is usually multidimensional.  The staff of our bases, by the time control becomes critical, usually becomes a monolithic team in which strong interpersonal relationships are established.  The base becomes a self-sufficient object, which as a whole monitors its own integrity, excluding the appearance of suspicious outsiders and information leakage from the inside.  But what motivates the top layer of the middle and the whole first level of management?  There is no way without an idea, an understanding of the purpose of their work and life.  Take this both of you.  What is your motivation to do your job? <br><br>  The custodial listeners did not immediately find what to answer the question.  Laer spoke first. <br><br>  - The Union of Worlds gave us neural networks and knowledge, providing opportunities that are inaccessible to the vast majority of people.  We were prepared for our roles from an early age and no one asked whether we wanted it or not.  But if asked, they would certainly get an affirmative answer.  Over time, someone might have a reappraisal of values, but it is unlikely that a person will voluntarily give up the opportunities that are available to us as a matter of course.  In the end, such opportunities are very expensive, it is logical that we are obliged to somehow work them out.  This is more like voluntary work than coercion. <br><br>  - Maybe more psychological reasons?  You consider yourself obligated.  It should be so.  After all, if you do not want, then for you there will be no special problems to disappear from the sight of the authorities and corporations, having lost somewhere on the Periphery.  Yes, they will search for you, search for indefinitely, but there are such worlds in the Periphery where it is not difficult to get lost forever.  And yet no one does. <br><br>  - I do not exclude that we have a certain psychological adjustment.  But subjectively, it does not cause inconvenience, but with interest it pays for itself with accessible possibilities. <br><br>  Laer glanced at Lex and he nodded affirmatively. <br><br>  - Well, let's imagine that you do not have to.  Yesterday, your corporation told you: ‚ÄúYou have worked everything and owed nothing to me.  You can do next as you know. ‚Äù  In the appendage, they give you a modern ship and a lot of money, which is enough for the maintenance of some small peripheral world for about three hundred years.  Will you continue to work for the corporation further? <br><br>  Laera thought for a moment. <br><br>  - The motivational reason for the work is not only the purely psychological reason for the responsibility of any social structure, be it a government or a corporation.  Yes, agents are not thrown into the "meat grinder", they are always widely introduced into the situation in which the problem has arisen requiring resolution, they leave the freedom of choice within fairly wide limits.  Therefore, one may get the impression that our work is clean and we are somewhat subjectively and idealistically related to reality.  But when performing my tasks, I always understand what I am doing and why.  And I have a certain feeling that my work helps to preserve the balance of worlds, that it strengthens them and, at least I, try to do my work with the least possible consequences for ordinary people.  If there is any task that needs to be resolved subtly, then let it be better for me to do this than send the butchers, who are clumsy in their work.  I don‚Äôt know about generalists, - Laera looked at Lex inquiringly, - but I don‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs fundamentally different, since the ‚Äúpsychological twist‚Äù method should be approximately the same. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAll the same,‚Äù Lex nodded.  - The thinner and less noticeable to those around you is your work, the higher your reputation in the environment. <br><br>  - So you will continue your work based on your presentation, so to say, the settings of this world? <br><br>  - Most likely, yes, I will. <br><br>  - Well.  Here you are.  Lex.  Your friends.  Familiar Lex.  Imagine that like you a lot.  What's next?  Will you all work for governments and corporations? <br><br>  ‚ÄúYou lead to that,‚Äù Lex grunted, ‚Äúthat sooner or later, the worldview and methodology of this group of people will be somewhat different from what the employer requires of them.‚Äù  That will lead to the birth of a sort of Order with all the consequences. <br><br>  - Right.  It is on this motivation that the first level of management of the Order works.  Our main goal is planning the safe development of civilization. <br><br>  - But why so hard?  Implicit management spends a lot of intellectual resources that could be used directly. <br><br>  - With the loss of a sense of independence, there is a risk that civilization will quickly fall into indifference, which is fraught with the rotting of its governing structures.  Why take the initiative if others think for you?  Lex, remember our last conversation.  At various stages of development of society, different interventions are needed.  At some stages it is not required at all, at others it is vital. <br><br>  - But who defines these stages and, most importantly, who knows what is required and when?  - Asked the question Laer.  - After all, it turns out something akin to playing God. <br><br>  - The question is correct, - the keeper squinted, looking at the woman.  ‚ÄúBut you will not get a direct answer today.‚Äù  We still have time and I can answer your questions.  But today I would like to tell why it is we who are here talking and thinking about all this. <br><br>  - What do you know about the neurostop project?  - asked Zarkon after a brief reflection.  - Laer?  This subject should be closer to you. <br><br>  - This is a large-scale project of the NBS to introduce functionality into the neural network that allows blocking the transfer of confidential information. <br><br>  - But it is already all there.  And for a long time.  Dignitaries have similar implants. <br><br>  - The current technology has flaws, the new one is designed to eliminate them.  Now it is implemented by the protection of a costly implant of memory banks.  In the new neural network architecture, as I understand it, protection will be distributed throughout the neural network and the functionality will be available to everyone.  When the neurostop is working, the neural network will no longer be able to be deceived, since the new technology will work not only with the human mind, but also with its subconscious.      ,      . ,        ,     .    ,     ,   . <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- I have long been introduced into the project. The final stage of the experiment was given to the Church, but it was even good, since I have good positions in it. The churchmen apparently decided that the boarding team recruited from the Periphery, of course, with the inclusion of their own people, would be quite suitable for this. According to the legend, the landing force was dropped from passing vehicles and ‚Äúsoftly‚Äù seized the ship. A guarantee of their correct work and loyalty was their evacuation in a few days. But the group commander apparently decided otherwise. I arrived aboard so late that you already dealt with them. Such a plan was not envisaged, and, unfortunately, no one will answer for what happened. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The keeper fell silent, an awkward pause hung. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Perhaps it is worth starting from the very beginning.

Their announcement is a kind of step by step, because of which there will be no return. You can step over it and find out a lot more interesting and unusual, expand your capabilities and take a direct part in setting up this world. And you can refuse. And yes, I will not only let you go without any consequences, but even help you settle in the far corner of the Periphery. You will have to survive and have to cooperate with us, because only the Order will be able to safely meet the maintenance needs of your neural networks and organisms. You want to live to your guaranteed three or four hundred years? It is not at all necessary to be further agents, your organizational or technical experience is quite suitable for us. Finally,- Zarkon snapped his fingers, - in everyday life has its advantages, a kind of charm and peace. Such a decision requires reflection, so I did not want to raise this issue right now.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúWell, just intrigued,‚Äù Lex said, exchanging glances with Laer. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- I am not a supporter of impulsive actions.

The zero planet was actually the maternal world of some past civilization, which possessed similar technologies. The Order chronicles deciphered what to look for and where to search and a whole industrial complex was found and exported on the zero planet, - the keeper gave an indefinite waving hand, - well, or we think it is an industrial complex, studying which the Order laid the foundations of neural network architecture. The zero planet is generally quite an interesting place, but this fact in itself is effectively hidden because this planet is a very important link in the navigation system of all mankind. The SCM government itself does the work for us and it‚Äôs very difficult to get into the zero world, not to mention keeping some kind of work in it.Seven and a half thousand years ago, the Order laid the foundations of the architecture of neural networks and the Order made sure that these foundations were not distorted. That is why the human neural network is so aggressive about external intervention - it was originally thought out and incorporated. Otherwise, we probably would have received not the take-off of cosmic civilization, but the return to some kind of analogue of feudal slavery with spaceships.</font></font><br><br>   ,     . <br><br> ‚Äî    .                .       .       ,        ,      .       ‚Äì           .     ¬´¬ª   ,          .             .        ,           .             .      ,     .  ,        ,              .   ,    ,      . <br><br>  *** <br><br>    .     ,      .    ,          ,     .      ,          .           .       ,   ,    .        ,   ,   .         .      ,   ,    .   ,    ,    ,    .  ,        .    ,           . <br><br>      ,           ,   ,       .        ,      .   ,  ,  ,      .  ,    ,    ,     .         .    :      ,    .         ,           .    ,  ,       .        .    ,        -     .  ,   ,    . <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- And if you shot? - Lex looms over his recent victim. - Or me? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Lex helped the woman up and walked her to the far corner of the room, from which the only open entrance to it could be traced.

And you may not like much. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Lex quickly hugged the woman and gently pressed her body tight to himself. Laera‚Äôs tension eased quickly and she relaxed. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Like or not ... I think it does not matter. Let's go to bed, ‚ÄùLex suggested in a few minutes.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Without undressing, they climbed onto an improvised bed. Laer pressed against the shoulder of a man who carefully covered them with something on top. Laera's emotional and physical excitement quickly transfused into a peaceful sleep. ‚ÄúInstead of sleeping properly on a ship, we, like some children, huddled into this corner,‚Äù she thought. I didn't want to think any more. Laera felt the warmth of a stranger's body, her arms around her, heard her breathing and felt like all of this she lacked all these decades. It cannot be said that all this time she was deprived of male attention, but now she was with those with whom she really wanted. And this feeling is fundamentally different from all that was before. She suddenly felt sharply tired for today. Falling into sleep, she suddenly thought of the guardian.</font></font><br><br> ‚Äî    ? <br><br>   , ,      .  , , ,      ,   .    . <br><br>  - What? ?    !  ,    . <br><br>  ,    . <br><br> ‚Äî    ?      . <br><br> ‚Äî    ,       , ‚Äî           . ‚Äì        ,      ,     -  . ‚Äî  . ‚Äî        ,    ,  -   . ,       ,  -         .        ,  .  . <br><br>         ,        ,            .      ,           ,        .       ‚Äî         . ¬´    , ‚Äî  , ‚Äî        ?    ?    ¬ª.          : ¬´ ,            ,    ¬ª?         ,            . ¬´    ,     ¬ª, ‚Äî -   .   -       .  ,         ,        . <br><br> ,  ,   . -               -  .          .        .           ,     .    ,         ?   . ,  , ,     ,   ,            ,    .       ?    .    ,        ?  ,   ¬´¬ª  ,      .

Suppose after the assignment you need to report to your curator, just a neural network confirmation of the truth of your words is enough, a sort of ‚Äúhonest word‚Äù conversation. Only the curator is sure that all words are honest. There is no need for evidence and cross-checking information. When applying for a job, it‚Äôs enough to ‚Äúunder neurostop‚Äù to assure the employer of its loyalty and everything, you don‚Äôt even need to follow the employee or arrange clever checks - if you suspect it, you simply call him and ask direct questions ‚Äúunder the neurostop‚Äù.Is the world ruled by truth? What will the world look like if it refuses a lie? It seems that humanity will get fantastic opportunities, the control system can be radically transformed. With the disappearance of unnecessary bureaucratic layers of civilization can simplify their management, accelerate their development and, most importantly, it will bring some guaranteed stability of this development. But if later, let's say, the millennium of building management on the neurostop technology, some kind of vulnerability will be revealed in it, then the whole civilization runs the risk of lightning, collapsing, retracing far back in development, falling, perhaps far below its present level. Just because in her control system there will be no natural immunity to lying. Lex knew people well and if there was any way to use something for his own personal purposes,then there will definitely be a group of people who will take advantage of this. Fantastic opportunities and the same magnitude of risk. ‚ÄúI wonder what the head of the Order thinks about it?‚Äù The man thought, finally falling asleep.</font></font><br><br><hr><br>  .  17. <br>  : 1.1.0. <br>    18.07.2018. <br>   : 06.08.2018. <br><br><hr><br>     <a href="https://habr.com/post/388341/"><b> 1</b></a> . <br><br> <b> :</b> <br> <a href="https://habr.com/post/412187/"><b> 16</b></a> ‚Äî  . <br> <b> 17</b> ‚Äî  . <br> <a href="https://habr.com/post/424897/"><b> 18</b></a> ‚Äî  . <br><br><hr><br>  ,    )        -    <a href="https://habr.com/post/371159/"> Nexcloud  Debian'</a> ,     , ‚Ä¶      11,(1)%   .   :        Habrahabr,    Geektimes,      .    - ? <br><br>     .       ,    ,        - .          : ¬´    ,     ?¬ª  , ,   ‚Äì  .       ‚Äì    ,      ,  ,      . <br><br>  ,         <a href="https://habr.com/post/373733/"> </a> .          ,      ,   .           2.0.0.        .  -  ( ): <br><br>  *** <br><br> ‚Äî    , ,  .  ,    20          .     . <br><br> ‚Äî        ,   .         ‚Äî    .    . <br><br> ‚Äî    .   .     ‚Äî      .      .  ,  ,     ,     .    ? ‚Äì  -      . <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Neural networks.

This gives new opportunities that are not noticed by those people, but the reader should notice this. On the other hand, we must somehow not overdo it.
