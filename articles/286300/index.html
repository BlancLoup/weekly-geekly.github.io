    <h4>  Part I {Planning} </h4><br>  Anyone who takes seriously self-development for the first time should always plan everything on a daily schedule (rather a dynamic schedule, as external circumstances can greatly affect the schedule itself). <br>  For example, I use these graphs (Graph 1 and Graph 2): <br><br>  Schedule 1 includes commitments, such as sutra, I go to the University or to Work, then I come home after the University and take a maximum of 2 hours to classes or when I go home after work I take 20-30 minutes to rest for myself, after that all the free time left I dedicate to self-development. <br><br>  The second schedule includes such days where there is plenty of free time, that is, weekends, holidays, vacations and then, here you can devote all your free time to self-development, of course there should also be free time for the family, for entertainment and other things like The approach is certainly good, but not for everyone, everyone can make their own individual schedules for themselves. <br><br><h4>  Part II {Optimization} </h4><br>  Now let's talk about some of the difficulties and obstacles arising on this true path. <br>  The first thing that manifests itself most strongly is the forced refusal of the brain from a new structure of human behavior or actions contrary to established habits. <br><br>  Example: <br>  You plan to say the next day to devote 4 hours to learning the C # programming language, this day comes and you open the book at the appointed time and as soon as you start learning this refusal effect appears, you just want to do something else rather than torture your consciousness. <br><br>  <b>Recommendation:</b> <br>  Overwriting an old negative habit into a new, positive one. <br><br>  The most important thing in this situation is not to be tempted by well-established negative habits, such as spending time playing computer games; instead, you should concentrate fully on daily study for 21 or 27 days so you will develop that automatism called positive habit. <br><br>  In our life there are only two important assets. The first asset is between your ears, and the second asset is of course the same time. <br>  Why should you think about your time? <br><br><h4>  Time is life </h4><br>  It is irreversible and irreplaceable.  To waste your time means to squander your Life, Taking control of your time means taking control of your life and using it in the best possible way. <br>  You need to understand that the question of time is always a matter of control.  Control over your thoughts, your feelings, the situation in which you are. <br><br>  In fact, with the help of the schedule and strict compliance with it helps us to realize everything that we wanted, there is nothing impossible.  When people say that they do not have time, in fact they are deceiving themselves and not effectively using their time, each of us has arms, legs, a head on his shoulders and 168 hours a week in order to properly and effectively use his time for (as I said) to achieve the desired. <br><br>  Below I will list a few tips on time optimization. <br><br><h5>  Optimization items: </h5><br><br><ul><li>  Stop watching TV anyway, nothing interesting is shown on it, the constant cycle of not interesting TV shows </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Stop playing computer games, they will still come in batches every year, you just will not have free time for your life </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Use your time efficiently - sensibly </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Do not let yourself relax during self-development </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Simply put, if you can not resist the temptation, then the easiest way to get rid of it once and for all, for example, delete all computer games, remove your pages on social networks and get rid of all that distracts you </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Part III {Stabilization} </h4><br>  <u>In order to stabilize everything in your life, here's what you need to do.</u> <br><br><ul><li>  Drink coffee once a month if possible, replace it with green tea </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Programming from 30-60 minutes a day whenever possible, studying more and more every day, I understand that it‚Äôs harder to start and just as difficult to force yourself to support yourself (motivate yourself) every day, a plan is a plan so you need to stop doing what you did it before, you need to create yourself anew from scratch, habits make us who we are </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Nowhere in a hurry to be consistent in its plan </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Goes to bed and get up in the morning at the same time for example: <br><br>  Working days: <br>  Morning - 05:07 Get up 30 minutes program, drink green tea and go to work or to the University. <br>  At night - 21:00 or 23:00 go to bed. <br><br>  Weekend, holiday, vacation days: <br>  Morning - 08:07 get up. <br>  At night - 21:00 or 23:00 go to bed. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  And most importantly, you should support this particular regime daily for a year or 4 months. <br><br><ul><li>  To maximize your physical abilities you need to first: <br><br>  Wring out - 10 times <br>  Tighten - 10 times <br>  Increase physical activity during progress * <br><br>  *example <br>  Wring out - 20 times <br>  Tighten - 21 times </li></ul></li></ul><br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  And in conclusion, I want to say that everything is possible in this world, if you properly adjust your mind! <br>  Crushing their negative habits and in spite of everything, never give up! <br>  As Dmitry Yasenev wished us all <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Programmers - to improve, improve and improve.</b> </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286300/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286300/</a></p>
