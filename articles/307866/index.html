Youtube, and Google, too, very well use all the modern achievements and research in the field of social philosophy, social psychology and sociology, and even know such words as ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù.  After all, in order to somehow manage with such a huge society (1 billion a month on YouTube) you cannot do without social philosophy (hello to philosophers).

      As one speaker said, the main person on YouTube is in Europe: all YouTube is about what is usual - it can be (shown) unusual - and yes, I agree, YouTube is in his philosophy just about this: extraordinary from ordinary.  He said that the first video uploaded to YouTube was about elephants, which Google engineer downloaded for the test (although I already hear the second version - which video on YouTube was the first).  And the first video downloaded in Ukraine was also about an elephant in the Kiev Zoo - ‚Äúthere is something in these elephants‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bbc/793/cce/bbc793cce527444e8615440e5a026b9f.png"><br><br>  I think everyone understands that before, when there was bad traffic, the Internet spoke with texts, because you don‚Äôt see much video on the 56k modem, but now that the channels have become better and more reliable, then the video has started to develop.  Why?  Firstly, because this is a huge time saving, if I need to fix, for example, a washing machine, what will I see first?  - video of course, and only then go to the article to watch.  That's why video develops - because of its better visibility - this is the main factor, and how a good way to save time. <br><br>  Texts - went to the video, so the video content will only grow.  Just as before the data was only on the hardware, now the same data went into the clouds - why?  because they are accessible from everywhere, they are much more flexible in management and take care of the physical media, and the safety of the video is already the care of the provider. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e9/a8d/4d8/5e9a8d4d836843db8d76768897bd13a4.png"><br><br>  Google has an office in Ukraine, in Kiev for 10 years.  He is headed by Dmitry Sholomko, he came out, said that he had a google on Ukraine, and specifically, in terms of YouTube, he had big plans.  Therefore, they organized such an event.  For what?  To develop those authors from Ukraine who bring content to YouTube, which is understandable, and so that those who are not very big understand how to develop their channels, how to create, properly promote and sell their content. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/318/4e4/4c0/3184e44c020745aba3b0c16a00febb3d.png"><br>  <i>The TV starts to understand little by little whether they want it or not - it will still be necessary to change, and it is better to be in these changes to participate in the process.</i>  <i>This slide is an excellent illustration that in the case of TV + YouTube everyone will benefit.</i> <br><br>  Several figures: 1 billion unique users come to YouTube per month - this is about a third of the entire Internet community in the world (yes, not all people in the world have Internet access). <br><br>  Every day on YouTube about 400 hours of video are loaded.  For you to understand this in the equivalent of life - somewhere 46,000 years of life. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e6/e77/3c1/5e6e773c199e4643aca70462b5d6fdf3.png"><br>  <i>Many of my friends listen to music on Vkontakte, and I listen on YouTube, for sure, it means I correctly thought that YouTube music is our everything.</i> <br><br>  80% - YouTube is not from the United States, but from other countries, including from developing countries in the YouTube segment, Ukraine is included here - Youtube in Ukraine is growing at 70% per year.  Those.  in Ukraine, YouTube is growing faster than it is growing globally - 83% of Internet users in Ukraine go to YouTube. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e3/7a0/40e/7e37a040eecb4a0f996c7bc51f20ffbd.png"><br><br>  In Youtube 108,000 video content creators (as Google representatives called them). <br><br>  Presented a single center for authors.  Previously, they had support only for the elect, i.e.  those authors who brought a lot of dough to YouTube, now you can not be distracted by the author, so that tech support treats you like a white person :) But cool authors are offered additional buns: the ability to use YouTube studios in Europe, all sorts of closed events for their .d <br><br>  80% of youtube authors are authors with the number of subscribers from 1,000 to 10,000. If you have 100,000 subscribers, then you are assigned a permanent manager who will lead you, say what to do and what to pay attention to, etc.  On the screen you can see that there is an author from Ukraine, EeOneGuy, who has more than 8 million subscribers - God!  How was it possible ?! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d16/774/f85/d16774f851fa4773acd9dd8fd64991c6.png"><br><br>  They said that in a couple of weeks they will launch another closed community for authors, so that the authors communicate with each other.  As I understood the announced goal of this community, it was brought so that the authors would help each other, so that there was a space where people united by one goal could talk and mutually enrich each other - I think that is cool.  Of course, there is some trick here, instead of support responding to millions of requests - people can help each other, the normal approach not only relieves tech support, but also develop the community, as for me it‚Äôs a good solution, if only it worked, but not was stillborn project.  There is a hope that after all the technical support on YouTube will be brought to mind, and then when you write in support of YouTube, it seems that you write to Solaris in demand ... <br><br><h3>  There was an interesting lecture about formats. </h3><br>  <i>360 format</i> <br>  Yes, they launched it, yes, they promised to finish it. <br>  In their opinion, it is most suitable for immersion into the atmosphere of the event, in the context of the event, where the user can look at something from the perspective that he chooses, and not just the one that the operator has chosen.  There is a combination of video and action of the viewer.  The most important thing is that the viewer can turn his head inside. <br><br>  Where do youtube recommend themselves to use it: <br>  - music (clips) <br>  - Extreme video (when someone flies somewhere, (not you :), you can admire the views of the shroud) <br><br>  <i>360 Live</i> - will soon be able to make live broadcasts in 360 mode. <br><br>  And, in connection with this, it is necessary to say that YouTube decided to catch up with Periscope, and now it will be possible to stream directly from the mobile to your YouTube channel.  Previously, it was scary confused - all sorts of (no one needed) hengauta, who shared with themselves that YouTube, then Google + many times, now all this will be only on the side of YouTube. <br><br>  During the streams from the mobile, it will be possible to see someone who commented out and immediately respond promptly if necessary, with one word they promise complete immersion in the stream - to catch up and overtake Periscope, as I understand it. <br><br><h3>  Any copyright troubles </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d86/d29/905/d86d299052604a148383e2b2ae44f229.png"><br><br>  There was a report on such an important issue for YouTube as copyright and how to work with it. <br><br>  What's new: <br>  - now strikes are not cumulative (yohu! Finally) and now if there was a mistake somewhere, or there was a conflict of rights, then there is no stigma on your channel.  They used to say that they used to chop off their shoulders in such a way that it would be noticeable to the author that he, <s>brute</s> , violated copyrights!  - I had strikes on my personal channel, and I have to say it sooooo as tangibly and noticeably, and thank God that this somehow somehow became more human. <br>  - removed the concept of bad channel reputation <br>  - Strike will now be not half a year, but 90 days (!). <br>  - now if someone has struck you with a strike on your video, then it will continue to be monetized, but after exploring the relationship with the copyright holder, all the money is transferred to the one who won the litigation - very wisely.  Generally, YouTube does not want to get involved in these litigation between copyright holders and creators of the video, and he says - figure it out, guys, yourself, if you don‚Äôt figure it out, then we ban everything and everyone. <br>  - there will be a new panel and a new policy regarding copyright infringements.  Where the panel itself will tell you what is the best way to do with your controversial vidos. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5f0/9f0/088/5f09f0088e64417cb42305c3410e12e0.png"><br><br>  There will be a lot of changes on infomaps, all sorts of hints, vidos annotations, etc. <br><br>  NB: I didn‚Äôt know that the clues are visible on the mobile, and the rest of the info cards are not visible, they said so. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f51/7ff/67e/f517ff67e7654ecc92801c648b578207.png"><br><br>  By importance, the metadata in the vidos are divided by the following descending rating: <br>  - the name of the vidos <br>  - description <br>  - subtitles (you can allow viewers to add subtitles). <br>  - annotations <br>  - tips <br>  - tags (it is not even necessary to translate them - as the robot translates them itself). <br><br>  They also said that localization is very important.  Since, for example, a person wants to watch a vidos, but does not know the language, if there are captions - he will look - and bring foreign traffic to your channel. <br><br>  It is always better to do subtitles, even though it will be a video about embroidery or Barbie, because if there are captions, then even if there is a person in another country who is interested in embroidery, he will be able to watch your video, and you will get traffic.  Because the robot itself, even if it has 2 similar vidos, but one will have subtitles, then it will choose the video that has the captions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ca/504/95e/0ca50495e1db47319a8183790da21435.png"><br><br>  You can order credits on the YouTube exchange of translations, but people at the conference said it was expensive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/819/21d/6e2/81921d6e241d482889b15e2592554cbf.png"><br><br>  An example of a copyright case, if there is a clip = song + video, 1 video clip can have 2 copyright owners - someone has music, someone has a video, but they have to agree, and choose the right policies when using one and the same vidosa - otherwise will konfilkt rights. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bd3/719/6c0/bd37196c02d841dfa062066933f86460.png"><br><br>  The most important thing about rights in YouTube is what the representative of YouTube said: fair use is not a panacea, it may not always work. <br><br>  For programmers: they said that the YouTube API will be better.  I didn‚Äôt go into details, because I‚Äôm not a programmer, but I remember that the channel subscription buttons for sites will be implemented, in my opinion a good innovation, since on Youtube currency is subscribers, and therefore, the more opportunities there are to gain subscribers it is better. <br><br><h3>  Analytics YouTube </h3><br>  There was an interesting report of such a ridiculous girl who tried to stir up the audience all the time (which she seemed to not react to: - although it was so interesting that everyone rushed to record) - with exclamations: ‚ÄúI can't hear you!‚Äù, Etc.  from the repertoire of pop singers :) But the report was interesting. <br><br>  She talked about how to read analytics YouTube.  The speaker gave a lot of information, below in bulk, my abstracts from the report are condensed: <br><br>  (In general, such events are useful, as one thing is to read the tedious help of YouTube, and it is not always possible to understand how this works in practice, and here is the exact reference, only from the practical side, with examples of interrelationships that influences what in YouTube) . <br><br>  - I already wrote that the most important lafhak - you should always look at the statistics not for 28 days, but for the last 90 days - it is more adequate in terms of the picture. <br><br>  - the most important thing is that the author of the youtube has the biggest traffic from the main page of the youtube - this means that your page (i.e., channel) itself is interesting for people and they find what to see there <br><br>  - it is important to analyze the analytics and demographics of subscribers - i.e.  This is the most important of your viewers, they need to be interesting.  Explore their demographics, geography and, accordingly, lead content strategy. <br><br>  - non-followers most often come from similar / popular videos.  At the same time, even if these similar videos are yours, this is not good, because the recommended vidos may be on the right side - and the audience will get out of your channel and forget about you. <br><br>  - a percentage of views is very important (Percentage of viewing a video <i>(quartile video)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Video viewing percentage: 25% - the number of views of the fourth part of the video.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Percentage of video viewing: 50% - the number of half video views.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Percentage of video viewing: 75% - the number of views of three-fourths of the video.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Percentage of video viewing: 100% - the number of video views to the end.)</i> <br>  the authors need to strive to have at least 50% <br><br>  - retaining the audience, if it can be seen as an example that was disassembled during a report that in the first 15 seconds viewers go to similar vidos - this means that the first thing viewers see in the video is not very interesting.  Therefore, the main difference here is: on TV, we cannot look at what will be there at the end, and in the video on YouTube we can.  Therefore, you should not be afraid to show the result at the beginning of the video: you will learn how to hammer in nails like this, or to cook this (show) borscht, that is, it‚Äôs important that a person sees the result right away so that the viewer will have the answer to the question immediately - why should he waste his time and watch this video? <br><br>  - the rating of vidos depends on the retention of the audience <br><br>  - if the audience leaves - we compare the same videos, and draw conclusions that they are better? <br><br>  - when we go to our channel, we have 2 shelves of vidos there: we are subscribed to, and we are not subscribed to (what YouTube offers you based on your views) - and now to get to this second section on the main pages of potential subscribers - it is necessary that the rating of the video is good, it likes and retains the audience. <br><br>  - it depends on the rating whether your vidos will get on the push notification (and also on the phones) for all your subscribers, if the video is not rated - YouTube will not send notifications to your subscribers that a video has appeared, go and see. <br><br>  - statistics will tell when to release vidos, but orientation for morning and evening is conditional, we have morning, and somewhere in the US it is evening, so this is not always a panacea <br><br>  - you need to strive to ensure that the statistics at least a third of the views - it was from subscribers <br><br>  - Retention of the audience needs to be watched not by the channel, but for each video separately, since the channel gives an average figure.  The author must clearly understand: why in this video the audience did not fall down, but in this fell down. <br><br>  - always think, analyze and answer the question: why was the surge in views?  why decline?  what happened at that time?  what is the reason? <br><br>  - discovered the awesome thing - ‚ÄúGoogle Trends‚Äù - you can learn a lot of interesting things, including why there was a surge of views.  A common example: the lad shot tricks, uploaded and forgot, and then comes in - and there are 4 million views.  This means that during this time some top blogger wrote down a vidos about tricks, or something happened (for example, Coperfield arrived or some other trick), and this video was already like ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù - and the arrival of views on the channel went. <br><br>  - by Google trends, you can track why something happens to your video and adjust your vidos.  For example, the query ‚Äúfitness‚Äù drops to zero in December (the new year, everyone eats - what kind of fitness?), And then takes off to the skies in February - all after the holidays went to drive fat. <br><br>  - you need to understand the difference between text and video presentation.  For example, it is better to call vidos about recipes and as a ‚Äúrecipe for something there‚Äù is like a text, and ‚Äúhow to cook something there‚Äù.  Since if a person goes to Google, he will score the ‚Äúrecipe‚Äù, and if he goes to YouTube, he will score ‚Äúhow to cook‚Äù, and now if you have all this in your video, then already in Google, as if he had not scored a search request, your video with the recipe will fall out already in search. <br><br><h3>  General thoughts </h3><br>  YouTube has long been such a mass media media that combines television, media, and the national newspaper.  So who could imagine that the connection: DVR + YouTube - significantly reduced the degree of arrogance of road inspectors? <br><br>  Now any phone is a camera, any phone is a tool for documenting and confirming any facts.  But YouTube has become such a popular media outlet; everyone‚Äôs popular news aggregators (such as Reedus) are still not that, because they are very dependent on the taste of the editors, and in this case everything is shown as it is, without editorial editing.  And if you think more broadly, then it is precisely such a combination - YouTube + phone - now this, I think, is the most important tool for upholding the libertarian values ‚Äã‚Äãof an open society. <br><br>  At the conference there was even a title discussion between representatives of the media (TV) and the authors of YouTube, where these guys from the TV told the guys in Youtube how they can help each other, because in the case of cooperation, TV gets a lot of free journalists who can be everywhere and always (and regular TV journalists cannot be everywhere and immediately), and the authors get PR and fame of themselves and their channels. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/71c/26b/684/71c26b684da944c6868e92f480044238.png"><br><br>  But in general, of course, the sea was very valuable information.  More often Yutoub would organize such events, or micro-agents, so that all this can be easily understood and not at a gallop in Europe, then the authors would have developed better.  In my opinion, a more detailed story (with cases) of how to use YouTube for a niche business, and not only in IT, and more generally, how to use YouTube as a good marketing tool, would be very much in demand. <br><hr><br>  The report's sponsor is <a href="https://www.sim-networks.com/%3Fpid%3D2449">SIM-Networks, buying and selling servers, VPS, hosting and clouds in European data centers</a> (thanks for letting go to the conference :). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/307866/">https://habr.com/ru/post/307866/</a></p>
