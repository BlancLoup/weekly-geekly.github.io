  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The invention of Ukrainian students is one of the best versions of TIME.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/524/36d/0d3/52436d0d3f7133eec09505d6e426f28d.jpg"><br>  Students of the Computer Academy "STEP" won the Imagine Cup 2012 in Sydney on July 10, a truly landmark event for the computer industry in Ukraine took place - for the first time in history, Ukrainians won one of the most prestigious IT technology competitions - the Microsoft Imagine Cup.  The quadSquad team, consisting of students of Donetsk Computer Academy "STEP", won in the most difficult category - software development (Software Design), in which more than 70 teams struggled. <br>  They presented to the world their socially-oriented project called <a href="http://techland.time.com/2012/11/01/best-inventions-of-the-year-2012/slide/enable-talk-gloves/">Enable Talk</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Which, according to the TIME magazine version, is included in the <a href="http://techland.time.com/category/best-inventions/">Best Inventions of the Year 2012</a> list along with the <a href="http://techland.time.com/2012/11/01/best-inventions-of-the-year-2012/slide/the-curiosity-rover/">Curiosity Rover rover</a> , <a href="http://techland.time.com/2012/11/01/best-inventions-of-the-year-2012/slide/google-glass/">Google Glass</a> , <a href="http://techland.time.com/2012/11/01/best-inventions-of-the-year-2012/slide/self-inflating-tires/">self-inflating tires</a> and many others. <br>  It is aimed at improving the communication of people with limited hearing and is a glove equipped with a large number of sensors, such as sensors bending fingers, a pair of accelerometers, a gyroscope and a compass, which allows you to collect information about the position of the hand in space and further convert the gesture into speech. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fc8/d9c/4c3/fc8d9c4c36ef0b181368b392942c26e3.png"><br>  The software part of the development (based on the Windows Phone 7 / Windows 8 platforms) ensures the reception of information from the glove sensors and its continuous conversion to an audio signal.  The information received via Bluetooth is transmitted to the smartphone, after a quick processing gestures are voiced by voice.  This invention will help deaf and dumb people communicate in an easier and more convenient way.  Also, the glove is equipped with solar panels, which optimizes the time of its use. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/91a/dc2/870/91adc2870b544369996e3394e6b80f7f.png"><br>  During the presentation, the team demonstrated the capabilities of the gloves, talking to the audience in sign language, which was instantly translated into voice.  All those present, including members of the jury, noted that they had not seen anything like this before, and the ability of Ukrainians not only to program, but also to solder the chips with their own hands was also highly appreciated.  ‚ÄúThe idea to create something similar came to us after talking with athletes, athletes, who had difficulties due to the fact that others do not understand sign language.  After thinking about this problem, we created a special glove.  Athletes from the Society of the Deaf and Dumb strongly support us, participate in testing - seeing their enthusiasm, the results obtained, we understand that we are doing a really necessary and socially significant project.  We hope that we will be able to help as many as possible of such people, ‚Äùsays one of the developers, Valery Yasakov. <br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/be3/c5f/5eb/be3c5f5eb8e41353ef2a2f0cb9ffcf30.jpg"><br>  The guys spent more than six months on the development of their project, it is assumed that such a glove will be worth only $ 200. <br><br>  Materials taken from the site: <a href="http://enabletalk.com/">"EnableTalk"</a> </div>
