  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Back at the desk</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Like any modern person, I periodically ask myself questions about the level of my development.  And the development in all its manifestations.  There are already an incredible number of topics in this area, but I would still like to deposit my five kopecks. <br><br><h4>  Is there a problem? </h4><br>  After all the well-known default methods that people write about and use (for example, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/31304/">‚ÄúHow to constantly improve their skills‚Äù</a> ), the question arose of more active teaching methods, and at the same time more conservative.  There are plenty of offers on the IT education market, yes, and unfortunately, on the ‚Äúmarket‚Äù.  According to reviews on the network, it is unrealistic to make the right conclusion about quality, especially for me, working in the field of as close as possible to IT, but with a different education from what is needed.  Therefore, not slyly, one of the most accessible ones were tried: books, in all their manifestations, and with many buns ‚Äî in the form of gift disks, no matter how ridiculous it may sound now;  course records, webinars, forums, trips to regular classes in training centers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  A little bit of impressions </h4><br>  Of course, everyone can say that without practice no study will help you, but still in the presence of a huge amount of it, the concept of processes at the level of intuition does not always save.  It is not surprising that in a relatively short time there was a huge pile of literature and training videos, because our industry is very difficult to call non-dynamic.  And some of the materials presented on the shelves of Internet shops, stores, torrent trackers of materials in English, native and powerful are worthy of attention, it seems to me, even industry gurus.  If you want names, surnames, addresses, then there are already enough ‚Äúholivars‚Äù. <br><br>  With regards to records, then if you do not want to pay, you will have to be content with just something ‚Äúwith mold‚Äù, as the copyright holder is watching.  Enthusiasts, leading quality channels on the tire is sorely lacking.

      In connection with all the familiar problem - the lack of time, I decided to try webinars.  The difference between the record and the real seemed huge, although stereotypes about the "classical and engineering" (soviet) education still hinder to perceive what is happening at the proper level.  Of the benefits: all the advantages of the webinar, the teachers' attitudes to the learning process are qualitatively higher, a clear practical focus, the ability to delve into the subtleties without departing from the topic and not spending a lot of time, the teacher‚Äôs interest in your development, I don‚Äôt know why, they all can marketers washed, the lack of a stupid look when asking stupid questions, the ability to hone everything that I learned on the remote virtual hardware without departing from the cash register and have no doubt that everyone will see for himself a lot of advantages.  From negative - periodic problems with the Azure services.  Studied in the center of the enemy redman Karmanova "atreying." <br><br>  The real trip to the training center is not that it is not impressed, but rather disbanded.  There were several times more technical problems than at the webinar, I didn‚Äôt recognize anything more than in the announced program of the course, or maybe less, the teacher‚Äôs attitude was not any, and a lot of related problems.  With regards to the pros - cookies and smiling staff.  Center "specialist" in terms of MS directions disappointed. <br><br><h4>  Instead of conclusion </h4><br>  Before zen comprehension is far away, there is no limit to perfection and all of the above, of course - IMHO, but still. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/236819/">https://habr.com/ru/post/236819/</a></p>
