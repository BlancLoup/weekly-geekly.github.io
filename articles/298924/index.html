      TED (Technology, Education, Design) is a non-profit organization that annually holds a conference at which prominent people of the world speak (Bill Gates, Bill Clinton, Sergey Brin, and many others) to spread ideas and discuss socially significant issues. <br><br>  TEDx is a project that allows you to organize TED-style conferences in various countries, cities, universities and other communities on a local scale. <br><br>  Preparation for our conference is in full swing.  And, since quite a large part of the work has already been done (the speakers were found, the program was thought out), I decided to write a series of articles on obtaining the TEDx license and on the initial stages of preparing for the conference in Russia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa6/0d9/969/aa60d99696dd44228c9076fe36640c3e.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Obtaining a license</b> <br><br>  In order to obtain a TEDx license, it is necessary to convince the project curators of their interest in holding a conference. <br><br>  In stock, you should have a few hours to read the rules for registration, organization, fundraising, team building and a few more guides.  Then the most interesting part begins - the answers to the TED questions.  Here you will need patience and fantasy.  We'll have to talk about the global goal of organizing the conference, what kindles the fire in your eyes and what ideas you think are worth spreading in your community. <br><br>  The waiting time for a response on obtaining a license can vary from a week to a month.  Although the probability of obtaining a license is high, it is also possible to ‚Äúcatch‚Äù a refusal.  My university colleagues with extensive experience in organizing such events could not show the curators that they are able to conduct TEDx at the proper level.  By the way, I also received a license not the first time. <br><br>  Some tips for obtaining a license: <br><br>  1) Before submitting the application, learn all the rules for organizing the conference, <br>  2) Think about who you would like to invite speakers to the conference.  It is unlikely that these people will ultimately be speakers, but already in the application it is necessary to show that you understand what ideas you will spread. <br>  3) Diversify ideas as much as possible and the people who spread them.  Technology, design, medicine, education, art - the list of topics that can be distributed at TEDx-event is almost endless.  Do not repeat any sphere - this can serve as a basis for refusal.  The same applies to people.  The first time I made a mistake - all speakers from my list were men.  I had to correct this error. <br>  4) Show that you have common values ‚Äã‚Äãwith TED: that you also want to spread worthy ideas and solve socially important problems in your community. <br><br>  <b>Team building</b> <br><br>  The TEDx project is a non-profit.  Most of the team for organizing the event will not get anything, so you need to look for people who are already familiar with TED and are willing to spend a lot of effort to ensure that the conference was held at a high level.  In the case of TED, finding such people is not so difficult. <br><br>  In a team, in addition to the leader (s), the following roles must be closed: <br><br>  * SMM specialist <br>  * Media Specialist <br>  * Designer (+ web developer) <br>  * Coach speaker familiar with the specifics of the TED format <br>  * Finance Specialist (sponsorship) <br>  * Team of operators and editors <br>  * Lead <br>  * Team of photographers <br>  * Volunteer team <br><br>  Tips: <br><br>  1) Light a fire in the eyes of your friends and acquaintances.  They can be very useful for organizing a conference (or looking for contacts). <br>  2) Do not actively look for a team.  TED is a very famous project.  Most likely, even before the organization process begins, you will be contacted with offers of assistance in the organization (the TEDx organizers community is quite harmonious, they will know about you almost before you get a license). <br>  3) On one enthusiasm of the organizers, a good TEDx event cannot be organized.  It is unlikely that you have good photographers, operators and presenters who agree to a free job only because it is TEDx.  Pay for the work of professionals honestly.  This requires sponsors (they will be discussed in subsequent articles). <br>  4) It makes sense to assemble a team gradually.  It is unlikely that you immediately need operators and trainers for speakers.  The larger the team, the more difficult it is to manage it. <br>  5) I am not an expert in the field of management, but I would advise to clearly distinguish the activities of the team from the very beginning of its construction.  It is important not to recruit people to the team that you may not need.  Draw an organization chart for the team with a clear indication of the tasks and deadlines for these tasks.  This is the basis for the organization of any activity.  This may seem obvious, but in the initial stages we made mistakes that could have been avoided simply by demarcating the areas of responsibility of each person. <br>  6) Meet the team at least once a week. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/bc0/b35/a33/bc0b35a331d8cc4cf717cf76dc347436.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Search for speakers</b> <br><br>  Searching for speakers is the most important part of the job.  We were lucky, and this process did not drag out for a long time: each subsequent speaker introduced us to a large number of new potential speakers, from which we chose whom we can trust to speak. <br><br>  Tips: <br>  1) Search not for speakers, but ideas that they spread.  Do not forget about the slogan of the conference - "Ideas worthy of distribution." <br>  2) At least 5 rehearsals and a lot of preparation work are needed with speakers.  It is impossible to rehearse every gesture and every phrase in a speech, but it is critically important to convey to the speaker the specifics of speeches at a TED conference. <br><br>  <b>Instead of conclusion</b> <br><br>  I really want TEDx-events to be held in our country more often and the quality of speakers and organizers every year becomes higher and higher.  In the following articles I will try to reveal in more detail the topics of working with speakers and sponsors, organizing team work. <br><br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298924/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298924/</a></p>
