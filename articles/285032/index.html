  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Work as a competitive process</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Introduction </h4><br>  Let's talk about the principles of distribution of tasks for employees, with the aim of increasing productivity.  In its own way, a new method of intangible motivation is proposed.  Much has been written about employee motivation methods (for example, <a href="http://www.ippnou.ru/article.php%3Fidarticle%3D002596">here</a> and <a href="http://www.elitarium.ru/2010/08/09/metody_motivacii_personala.html">here</a> ).  The main task of the employer is to organize such working conditions and psychological atmosphere in the workplace, so that the work is done qualitatively, without too much ado and in compliance with the deadlines set. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When I talked about the emerging idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe organization of labor to my friend, an old joke came to mind: <br><br>  A man comes to the doctor and complains: <br>  ‚ÄúYou know, doctor, I have such hard work.‚Äù  I'm very tired, write me something. <br>  - Where are you working and what are you doing?  - asks the doctor. <br>  - I work in the basement.  There is a gutter through which oranges roll.  They should be sorted into small and large. <br>  - And what is difficult in your work?  - asks the doctor. <br>  - I always have to make decisions, and this is so difficult! <br><br><h4>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äúcreative hunger‚Äù </h4><br>  At Google, employees are given the opportunity to spend 20% of their work time on their projects - it's just great!  Employees develop comprehensively within the company, raising its level to the skies.  But how to motivate people perfectly to do the main work, with enthusiasm, plunging into it headlong?  How to create and direct this enthusiasm in the right direction?  Creative hunger can effectively cultivate enthusiasm!

      I just want to clarify that this idea is most relevant for work that contains at least a small fraction of creativity and has the ability to be organized in an organized way in task distribution systems (just a task for professional slang).  I am pleased to read about the possibilities of applying this approach in other areas. <br><br><h4>  Process </h4><br>  Imagine a typical developer day.  He came in the morning, opened his list of works, saddened himself, took on the most important task, and set to work.  Having done that, he closed the task.  I looked again at the unabated list of works and proceeded to the next.  This happens day after day.  In this case, the employee very quickly loses interest in work, becomes sluggish and unproductive, the spark that was at the beginning of work disappears.  How to avoid it? <br><br>  Denote some supervisor for the project.  Let it be the same project manager, team leader or architect.  Whose responsibilities include the distribution of work in the system of tasks. <br><br>  Then the worker's labor flow changes.  He came in the morning, opened his list of works, found one single task.  Began to work.  After a while, I closed the task and found another one.  Opened the task and began to work.  Completed the job, closed the task and again review the list of tasks.  And there are none!  None!  You sit for an hour, two, three, maybe even a day, but there are no tasks.  You understand that at this time you can read something, learn a new technology, have a rest or go in for sports.  By inertia, you constantly check, there is no new task.  And it appears, an interesting work appears!  Her decision does not seem to take much time, but there is work!  And with new forces, you can rush into battle. <br><br>  After some time, the employee realizes that in his free time, in the absence of tasks, he can relax, go about his business, or do self-study. <br><br><h4>  Principle </h4><br>  This method works on the principle of social networks, when the user continuously updates the page to see the changes!  Immediately update the task list turns into a ritual. <br><br><h4>  Advantages and disadvantages </h4><br>  This approach has both positive and negative points.  But the positive sides, in my opinion, more. <br><br><h5>  pros </h5><br><ul><li>  The worker does not plan his workflow; </li><li>  He has free time, which he can spend profitably for himself; </li><li>  Tasks are transformed from routine work into a game of chance, where the prize is free time; <br></li><li>  There is no interest in protracted and long-term projects; </li><li>  The company is acquiring another process to improve the skills of its employees and its loyalty to the company. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Minuses </h5><br><ul><li>  The supervisor needs to monitor the performance of work by each employee and plan when to give new ones; <br></li><li>  The method is not applicable to projects without clear design documentation; </li><li>  The heads have to work individually with each employee. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  This method is well combined with existing workflows.  It can increase the labor productivity of both individual employees and the company as a whole. <br><br>  With a well-established process, you can effectively solve complex problems and cope with force majeure.  At the same time there is flexibility and predictability in business. <br><br>  And what do you think about this? <br><br>  PS: Give a rating - argue the decision in the comments.  But it turns out a silent minus ... I want to know whether this idea of ‚Äã‚Äãorganizing work has the right to life. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285032/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285032/</a></p>
