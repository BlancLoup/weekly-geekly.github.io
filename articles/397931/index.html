But the changes that were officially presented on it concern buyers no less than sellers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The essence of the changes was announced a few months ago and it comes down to the fact that now the opportunity to add goods to the cart appeared right on the Market itself.

      From a marketing point of view, this sounds a bit more complicated: the CPC (‚Äúpay-per-click‚Äù) model has changed to a CPA (‚Äúpay-for-purchase‚Äù in this case) - i.e.  the shops pay Yandex now not for every visitor who has come over to Market, and they are sharing the percentage of the purchase itself.  Thus, if before Yandex.Market was a showcase, now there is also a cash register. <br><br>  Not all companies accepted this with enthusiasm - few people like changes, especially when they imply the loss of some control over their own business processes, all the more so important, like the sales process itself. <br><br>  Therefore, the head of the Market Pavel Alyoshin and the director of products for stores and partners Yevgeny Kuzmenko had to spend a lot of words and valerian to explain why the dramatic changes were for the better. <br><br>  <b>What happened:</b> from September 27, 2016, in 179 categories of goods Yandex.Market for the Moscow region, goods with the possibility of buying directly in the Market will occupy priority places in issuance.  Goods with the purchase of the transition to the store site will remain, but will go only after the offers of partners who supported the possibility of buying through the Market. <br><br>  Along with the new functionality, the design of the model card was updated: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae2/18c/351/ae218c35105a4e8a8395e814f985a2f7.png"><br><br>  This is only the first of the three stages of the full migration of Yandex.Market to the CPA-model: according to the announced plans, in the spring of 2017 a similar relocation of some categories will take place all over Russia, and next autumn the full transition of the Market from the format of the advertising catalog to the full-fledged marketplace should be completed. <br><br>  Although the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãturning Marketta into a full-fledged marketplace suggested itself, the project representatives refer to the experience of other giants of online commerce: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a14/e98/6c6/a14e986c6b3148508b9488b463c15a4a.png"><br><br>  However, pay attention that the commission of Yandex will be much lower: 2% against, say, 6% at "Amazon". <br><br>  Pavel Aleshin and Yevgeny Kuzmenko promised the following ‚Äúgingerbread‚Äù to the shops: <br><br><ol><li>  <b>Greater predictability of advertising costs.</b> <blockquote>  <a href="http://oborot.ru/article/936/6">The average share of advertising expenses for stores connected to the Market is from 5 to 20%.</a>  <a href="http://oborot.ru/article/936/6">In topics with high competition and a large average check, it reaches 30%.</a>  <a href="http://oborot.ru/article/936/6">For comparison, according to the new model, the minimum payment for an order is 2% of the value of the goods, that is, the DDR is equal to 2%</a> . </blockquote>  The cost of promotion through Yandex.Market is now reduced to a fixed and predictable percentage of the value of the goods. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/807/369/57a/80736957abba4c67b8d2198d2b1d066e.png"><br><br></li><li>  <b>Fair competition.</b>  Now it‚Äôs impossible to force the store to overspend its advertising budget by clicking on transitions. <br></li><li>  <b>Mobilization without reorganization.</b>  The generation of people for whom the entire Internet is in their mobile phone is already entering a paying age, and anyone who has used Yandex.Market at least once in their life knows that the sites of most stores are absolutely not ready for this.  Now they will not lose mobile users and without the cost of remaking sites or creating mobile versions. <br></li><li>  <b>Increase conversion.</b>  In the theory of sales it is well known that any extra step in the buying process reduces the chances of bringing it to the end.  Due to the shorter way from selection to purchase and within the same site, the conversion from ‚Äúsaw‚Äù to ‚Äúbought‚Äù will be higher. <br></li><li>  <b>Processing compensation:</b> when making a prepaid purchase, the store does not pay commission per order, i.e.  The market does not charge 2% from the store. </li><li>  <b>Help during the transition: in</b> order to sweeten the pill as much as possible, Yandex.Market programmers prepared modules for 10 popular CMS embedded in the system for the most simple transition of stores to a new work scheme. </li></ol><br>  But the users, who, as you know, do not care who sells the goods to them for as long as everything is fair, reliable, and as cheap as possible, generally in chocolate: <br><br><ol><li>  <b>Less confusion:</b> no need to go to different sites, go back to Yandex for comparison, and go back to sites.  No need to understand the different, who is in that much, interfaces of different stores. </li><li>  <b>Honest reviews:</b> if you have been to runet freelance exchanges, then you know how popular are the orders for fake reviews for Yandex.Market.  Now, when payment passes through Yandex, the service will know for sure whether you have bought a product from them about which you are going to tell. </li><li>  <b>Full mobility.</b>  If you did not read the list of buns for the stores above, then you need to repeat that the Yandex.Market products that are now available for order are fully mobilized - no attempt to get from the screen of a four-inch smartphone to get a tiny reference in the corner of the reduced browser version of the site page that was drawn back in 2007. </li><li>  <b>Security.</b>  Taking on the functions of the cash register, the Market at the same time provides arbitration for resolving disputes with shops.  Earlier, when buying on the store's website, the client stayed alone with him, even if he later wrote complaints to Yandex technical support.  Now she can actually help those who complain to them. </li></ol><br>  However, the main advantage of the ‚ÄúOrder on the Market‚Äù from the point of view of the consumer seems to me not even these all of Yandex‚Äôs arguments, but how this will affect the market as a whole.  Although many stores were quick to blame Yandex for monopolizing the market, in fact, it is easy to see that Yandex makes it easier for new retailers and even manufacturers to enter it directly.  Unlike the former state of affairs, when small shops could not compete on equal terms with giants for the price of a click, now everything is in equal conditions.  And due to the fact that Yandex.Market provides access to a huge audience in one place, this opens up the possibility of entering the market directly to producers of goods: <br><br><blockquote>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nikolay.belousov/posts/10209310711979305">Imagine a conditional sofa factory in Kovrov, which just needs to make a high-quality photo session and a description of your sofas, upload them to the Market via YML and build direct sales using the Yandex infrastructure</a> . </blockquote><br>  The announced further development of the Market‚Äôs ecosystem includes its own delivery services and telephony - coupled with the payment launched via the Market today, it opens up opportunities for manufacturers to sell their goods without distributors, and for stores to save on logistics and advertising costs.  Those.  the market will become open to new participants, which means more competitive, and therefore more profitable for those who come to him with the intention to buy something.  Marketing is marketing, and purchases will become a bit more profitable - this is, in general, the main conclusion from the point of view of the consumer from the current Yandex revolution. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397931/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397931/</a></p>
