    <h5>  Why don't "pirates" pay? </h5><br>  The market lacks the ability to quickly find and download movies, and any other content.  Where does a person get a movie?  There is an opportunity to watch movies online, there is an iTunes Store.  But these offers suffer from limited choice or high prices, and low download speeds. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  It is because of these reasons that people follow the movies for torrents.  Because everything is there and it loads quickly. <br><br>  Only 10% of torrent users are pirates by conviction (supporters of free content).  The rest are willing to pay, but there is no convenient solution. <br><br><h5>  Already there are schemes when users are forced to pay for content.  How do they work? </h5><br>  Basically, these are awesome show trials.  For example, the recent trial of the user VKontakte.  Loaded counterfeit - get the deadline.  It is clear that you don‚Äôt incite everyone, but for such actions you need scapegoats. <br><br>  What we offer is a preventive approach.  The user initially will not be able to download counterfeit content.  A "license" can, but for a small fee. <br><br><h5>  Tell us more about your "preventive" solution? </h5><br>  The solution consists of two parts.  The system of search and blocking of unlicensed content and the system of paid distribution of content in torrents. <br><br>  Initially, we wanted to block content on the side of the Internet provider.  But understand that this is a difficult option. <br><br>  Now we have a completely different solution.  We operate in the cloud and catch files by attributes, namely, by a label that is written in all files, info-hash, individual coded label. <br><br><h5>  That is, you will close all unlicensed content on the trackers? </h5>  (burst into tears) <br>  Of course not.  Content blocking will be made at the request of the copyright holder.  The ‚ÄúYolok‚Äù producer comes to us and says: ‚ÄúClose‚Äù.  We will close.  But at the same time we will give the opportunity to download from the torrent the same high-quality licensed version of the film, but for a small fee. <br><br>  We do not plan to close everything.  There is content without a host, there are publishers who, on the contrary, support the distribution of content through alternative methods, this is part of their marketing strategy. <br><br>  We are planning to make the payment as simple as possible ‚Äúin one click‚Äù, not only through common payment systems, but also, for example, withdrawal from the client‚Äôs account with an Internet provider. <br><br><h5>  I think that now many users of torrents are indignant and ready to ‚Äúblow up‚Äù you.  Are you not ashamed that you are blocking access to free people? </h5><br>  No, not ashamed.  Our decision comes just in time.  We do not close, we help torrents exist further, but in a civilized way. <br><br>  The state will continue to tighten the screws for the benefit of the right holders.  After all, we need to join the WTO.  Cases where ordinary users will be brought to court will be not uncommon.  And we solve this issue differently. <br><br>  Users will be able to quickly download high-quality legal copy.  The right holders will receive the money. <br><br>  Well, if straight, then I will answer in Hebrew.  The question to question.  Are not you ashamed?  You do not take cars in car dealerships for free. <br><br><h5>  Why the torrent sites themselves did not decide to raise money from users? </h5><br>  They tried.  But it did not work out.  For example, Bram Cohen tried to launch something similar in BitTorrent, but for some reason they didn‚Äôt do well.  Perhaps due to the fact that they did not block all the content, but gave the right to choose: download for free or pay. <br><br><h5>  Are there any customers? </h5><br>  Now we are negotiating with several copyright holders.  Agreements of intent have already been concluded with Russian right holders and distributors.  The market is big.  Only in Russia rolls up to 450 films a year.  And the Russian market is only 6% of the world.  There is where to dig. <br><br>  Right now, my colleague is negotiating with a potential client in the United States: the producer of adult content PinkVisual has become interested in our decision. <br><br><h5>  Will you come to Point in Perm? </h5><br>  Not only I will come, but I will also tell about our achievements.  So I invite everyone to participate. <br><br>  PS <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php%3Feid%3D154712497916084">Point in Perm on Facebook</a> . <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/115597/">https://habr.com/ru/post/115597/</a></p>
