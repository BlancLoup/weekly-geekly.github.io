There are two compartments in which a laptop and a tablet fit easily.  If desired, this backpack will fit a 17-inch laptop, however, to accommodate it, you need to remove one of the internal departments.  To do this is a matter of a few seconds. <br><br>  The backpack does not pass moisture due to its coating - it is water-repellent 900D polyester with TePlon impregnation DuPont.  He himself is tough, he can be put on the floor and the backpack will not lose its shape.  The back of eBags Professional Slim Laptop is orthopedic, so wearing it is very comfortable.  And yes, the fabric lets air in, so the back won't sweat.  You must admit that this is the most annoying thing in backpacks. <br><br>  The backpack differs from many other models not only in the number of pockets, but also in their thoughtful, rational layout.  On the front side there is a vertically opening pocket with a secret zipper, where you can put all those things that need quick access.  Inside there is a compartment, where there are a few pockets, where all these little things you need now fit comfortably - USB wires, headphones, MP3 player, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/891/dc6/8ee/891dc68ee91638136153aadbd42e05d9.jpg" width="850"><br><br>  In the backpack itself there are three large departments, including a special compartment for a laptop with a rectangular foam pad.  Before this department is another one where you can place a tablet.  And on the inside of this department there is a fleece lining that protects the tablet screen from scratches.  Plus, a compacted compartment for a laptop power supply, YKK locks, a pocket for water, and other small items. <br><br>  If we consider the possibility of carrying a backpack in a vertical and horizontal position, then it can be called one of the best. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/90W76qIuVMo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <b>Dimensions and weight</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Weight: 1.5 kg; </li><li>  Dimensions: 420 x 320 x 165 mm; </li><li>  The size of the department for a laptop: 400 x 300 x 38 mm; </li><li>  The volume of the backpack: 17 liters. </li></ul><br>  Madrobots has a backpack <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/ebags-professional-slim-laptop-backpack/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dryukzak_obzor">available on pre-order</a> , you can also buy it <a href="http://www.ebags.com/product/ebags/tls-professional-slim-laptop-backpack/249582">from the manufacturer</a> . <br><br><h3>  Backpack XD Design Bobby </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/220/956/8ce/2209568ce4bf42faa3a38b36caa99f2f.png" width="850"><br><br>  One of the best backpacks, which at one time received strong support from Kickstarter and Indiegogo users.  Our blog has already <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/madrobots/blog/282286/">published a review of</a> this miracle of engineering and design ideas, but in the collection of backpacks it is impossible not to mention it again.  Here, it seems, there is almost everything a geek needs.  This anti-theft system, and ergonomic design, weight distribution, LED strips, USB-port for charging the phone.  Everything is thought out to the smallest detail. <br><br>  Inside the backpack is a laptop compartment (maximum 15.6 inches), a tablet compartment and another compartment for other things.  The walls and partitions are composed of layers of various materials.  This is polypropylene, stiffening, polyester, a soft layer to absorb the energy of impact, plus several layers of fabric that provide additional protection.  Of course, the top layer is waterproof.  Lightning is hidden here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f8d/151/613/f8d15161370bacfda54b73c6a5fe1cba.jpg" width="850"><br><br>  The reflectors on the backpack will be useful for cyclists or motorcyclists - at night they are noticeable from a distance of up to 100 m. Accessories are very high quality, lightning, for example - from the company YKK.  The detailed layout of the compartments allows you to correctly distribute the weight and reduce the burden on the shoulders.  The heaviest objects are located closest to the back, and the partitions between the compartments do not allow the weight to move when moving.  So the weight of the backpack is perceived to be 20-25% lighter than when using standard models of backpacks. <br><br>  The interior space is not the largest, but in a backpack almost all the things that a geek usually carries with him will fit.  It can be a laptop, camera, charging systems, glasses, documents, smartphone, tablet and more. <br><br>  <b>Dimensions and weight</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Dimensions: 450 x 300 x 165 mm; </li><li>  Weight: 850 g; </li><li>  Volume: 13 liters. </li></ul><br>  You can order the XD-Design Bobby backpack <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/xddesign-bobby/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dryukzak_obzor">from Madrobots</a> . <br><br><h3>  Backpack Cocoon Slim </h3><br>  This backpack has a very original organization of internal space.  So, inside is a platform, a double-sided surface, to which you can attach a lot of things with a large number of elastic straps.  Mouse, phone, camera, pens, documents - everything can be attached to such a surface.  Such a system of organizing things called Grid-It is called, and Cocoon manufactures a large number of different backpacks and bags based on it. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b2zULNyGhqw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  One of the backpacks that are best suited for geeks is Cocoon Slim.  You can ram in it a laptop (or two), a tablet, a smartphone, plus many little things.  All thanks to the rational organization of space. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c82/350/87c/c8235087c147c22bc8c6895092c48242.jpg" width="850"><br><br>  Like all other backpacks mentioned in this selection, Cocoon Slim is waterproof.  In addition, it is made of ballistic nylon, so this rucksack is also resistant to brute force, it is difficult to tear the fabric.  It looks small, but a lot of things fit there.  The lower part of the backpack is protected by an additional waterproof stripe, which is easy to clean from dust and dirt (if it suddenly appears).  It has a backpack and a rather dense frame, which makes it even more convenient. <br><br>  In general, Cocoon Slim can be called an almost perfect backpack for the geek, who does not need to leave the city limits.  You will not go on a hike with such a backpack, but within the limits of a settlement it is an ideal option. <br><br>  <b>Dimensions and weight</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Dimensions: 31.11 x 6.99 x 45.54 cm; </li><li>  Weight: 1.14 kg. </li></ul><br>  You can buy from <a href="http://www.cocooninnovations.com/product_info.php%3Fcat_id%3D0%26product_id%3D244">the manufacturer</a> . <br><br><h3>  Backpack WENGER 22 liters </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/092/795/d1b/092795d1b4e1ad18cba8adb728915e3a.jpg" width="850"><br><br>  Another relatively small backpack.  It has one main compartment, a large number of additional ones, plus a zipper fastener, as well as a soft orthopedic backrest, which makes carrying a backpack comfortable and convenient.
