      <u>Artist - artist, sculptor.</u>  Yes, you are already in the comments write that you can translate the word as an artist in the sense of "creative person."  But we are accustomed to the value of the artist as a singer, lead.  And for carriers <i>artist</i> , first of all, it is associated with the visual arts. <br><br>  <u>Band - music band, orchestra, tape, radio wave band.</u>  In principle, you can translate the word as ‚Äúgang‚Äù, but no longer as a criminal group, but as a group of people.  But for this there is a more popular word <i>‚Äúgang‚Äù</i> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jn/k7/rn/jnk7rnvjcu-ro3kk_1dw68lsd_4.gif"><br><br>  <u>Baton - baton, wand (for the conductor or for the baton), baton.</u>  That is, it will be unusual for bearers to hear this word in the sense of the usual type of bread.  For such purposes, they will say ‚Äú <i>French bread</i> ‚Äù.  And only experienced cooks will understand you right away if you still decide to say <i>baton</i> on the type of bread. <br><br>  <u>Blank - pass, space, dash, blank cartridge and a bunch of other values.</u>  But obviously not the form.  Although there is a little close meaning in meaning - an empty lottery ticket. <br><br>  <u>Bucket - bucket, tub, bucket, bucket.</u>  In general, not a bunch of flowers.  For such purposes there is a <i>bunch of flowers</i> . <br><br>  <u>Cabinet - glass cabinet, chest of drawers, wardrobe and even the government.</u>  And the office in which we work or study (something that looks like an office) is called <i>study</i> . <br><br>  <u>Climax - interchange, climax, highest point, climax.</u>  In general, obviously not how I would like to translate in the first place. <br><br>  <u>Complexion - color or shade, the structure of the skin.</u>  That is, not at all the structure of the body.  But only skin, remember! <br><br>  <u>Data - well, then you yourself know that this is data, facts, indicators, all sorts of there,</u> and not a date. <br><br>  <u>Direction - direction, area, disposal, management.</u>  That is, not the directorate, as a governing body, namely, a management method. <br><br>  <u>Fabric - fabric, texture, fabrication and even construction.</u>  But not a factory. <br><br>  <u>Fundament - ass, buttocks (yes!).</u>  In general, quite far from the foundation ( <i>foundation, basis,</i> and so on). <br><br>  <u>Heroine is a heroine.</u>  Not heroin.  Look, do not confuse (even the B-2 even in Russian could confuse us a little in their song ‚ÄúFellini‚Äù!). <br><br>  <u>Italic (s) - italics, and it‚Äôs not Italian, but simply italics.</u> <br><br>  <u>Insult - insult, insult.</u>  In medicine, it can still mean hemorrhage, but for the word "stroke" in English, <i>stroke</i> or <i>blood stroke is</i> more often used. <br><br>  <u>Liquor</u> is not a liquor, but there is a direct connection with alcohol.  In a sense, <u>it is quite strong alcoholic beverages.</u>  And for liqueur there is the English word <i>liqueur</i> (even more French). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/at/pi/z8/atpiz8-_ttv_5lhzd8kpnl01idw.gif"><br><br>  <u>Marsh - swamp or marsh.</u>  Do not confuse with the English march - <i>march</i> ! <br><br>  <u>Mayor - Mayor.</u>  Not the major, but the mayor.  Major in English will be <i>major</i> . <br><br>  <u>Metropolitan</u> - subway, you thought.  But no, <u>this is such a big city, metropolis, capital or something related to a big city, capital (adjective)</u> , and not a metro or subway ( <i>metro, subway,</i> and so on). <br><br>  <u>Parole</u> is not a password, but we know for a long time that a password is a <i>password</i> .  <u>And the translation of parole sounds like ‚Äúthe early release of the prisoner from prison‚Äù!</u> <br><br>  <u>Physic - medicine, drug, laxative.</u>  And only one letter separates <i>physic</i> from physics as a science - <i>physics</i> . <br><br>  <u>Physician - it is formed from the previous word and means the doctor, the doctor.</u>  A physicist will be in English <i>physicist</i> . <br><br>  <u>Preservative is a preservative.</u>  In general, do not rush to translate it immediately as <i>condom</i> - they have too different areas of application. <br><br>  <u>Prospect - view, panorama, perspective, opportunity,</u> not avenue.  <i>Avenue</i> is an avenue as a type of street, and a <i>booklet</i> is a handout. <br><br>  <u>Receipt</u> - sounds like a recipe.  But do not be deceived, <u>this is a receipt, revenue.</u>  Although a long time ago the word was associated with culinary recipes, now for such cases there is a <i>recipe</i> . <br><br>  <u>Restroom - toilet, toilet.</u>  Of course, there you can relax (in your own way).  But in the sense of rest from work, study, and so on, there is a <i>recreation room</i> . <br><br>  <u>Robe - robe, mantle, cassock, robe.</u>  A robe to work in English will be <i>overalls</i> . <br><br>  <u>Scenery is a landscape, a view</u> , but definitely not a script. <br><br>  <u>A</u> servant is not a cupboard or a sideboard.  A <u>servant or servant.</u> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sj/18/sg/sj18sg1z9d9agqldc04y9_vx3w0.gif"><br><br>  <u>Stake - stake, pillar, bet.</u>  And this word is not related to food ( <i>steak</i> ), although it is very similar in sound. <br><br>  <u>Talon - long claw or nail, deck.</u>  But the Russian word "coupon" is translated as <i>coupon</i> or <i>ticket</i> . <br><br>  <u>Tip is a tip, tip, hint, tip.</u>  In short, there are still many meanings, among which there is no Russian word ‚Äútype‚Äù ( <i>type</i> ). <br><br>  <u>Trap</u> is not a trap, but a <u>trap</u> .  As Admiral Akbar shouted in the famous Star Wars scene: ‚Äú <i>It's a trap!</i>  " <br><br>  <u>Valet</u> is not a card jack ( <i>knave, Jack</i> ), but a <u>footman, servant or hotel employee who will drive your car to the parking lot.</u> <br><br>  <u>Vine</u> is not wine.  <u>This is a vine, a whip.</u>  Although it is not so difficult to confuse in speech, because <i>wine is</i> only slightly different in pronunciation.  So it is important to monitor the context. <br><br>  <u>Wallet</u> is another word that is sometimes confused with Russian ‚Äújack‚Äù.  But <u>it's a wallet or purse</u> ! <br><br>  We, of course, know that this list can be continued for quite a long time.  And, most likely, we will do it, but next time, in order not to bore you too much in this article.  By the way, you can suggest your own words in the comments, perhaps they will fall into the next selection! <br><br><h2>  Reader Bonuses <br></h2><br> <a href="https://www.englishdom.com/myprofile/purchases/1geektimes3online/%3Futm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_campaign%3Dwords_wrong151117"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e9/tf/yz/e9tfyzko4el0o2eyab8drkgqeim.png"></a> <br><br>  We give free access to three months of learning English through our online courses.
