And if, of course, you want, you can even build a warship and destroy them all. <br><br>  All this will sound like a ridiculous fantasy for any gamer who has spent $ 60 on a video game more than once and passed all 12 levels.  How can all this ‚Äúinfinite number of planets‚Äù fit on a single DVD? <br><br>  The whole "trick" in technology called procedural generation, the essence of which is that the game does not store countless creatures, but the methods of their creation. <br><br>  PS3 Home <br><br>  Any owner of this console will be able to create a beautiful version of himself who lives in a clean, terrific version of the real world, and you will live next door to other gamers. <br><br>  Experts at PrisonPlanet.com in their article gave an assessment of the game. <br><br>  Yes, it is incredibly difficult to resist the temptation to be the ideal of himself.  In PS3 Home, no one will be fat, you can see this by looking at the picture.  The game will be a new stage in the development of the virtual world.  Despite the fact that this is a virtual utopia, people want it, which means it will definitely appear. <br><br>  <strong>2013: handheld computers and unlimited access to the Internet</strong> <br><br>  PS3 in your pocket <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/80f/af8/b6b/80faf8b6bad4ba56a0572c7ac08346ae.jpg" width="450" height="160" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Yes, we will live on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox generation ... 720, no matter what the manufacturers call it.  The main hitch in the gaming industry was that people could not sit at home at computers all the time, they needed to go outside.  That is why miniature computers will be the solution.  The leader of sales will be Nintendo DS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/2c6/1a1/b8f/2c61a1b8f1cbadc1309577014165a20b.jpg" width="400" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  If earlier people in transport read newspapers, in the future they will play their favorite games.  In 2013, you must have a portable and as powerful as a PS3 or 360 computer, destroying any boundaries of the reality of what the human eye can see on a small 4-inch small screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/ffb/cee/7a8/ffbcee7a8e5107c79378f9af0de81e70.jpg" width="400" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  4G Miracle <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/d61/774/9fc/d617749fc9fa1b682c9c09269610bb5a.jpg" width="400" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  4G is the standard of the future, which will give users wireless communication of 100 Mb / s, regardless of where you are.  This is at least 30 times faster than the best DSL 2017 connection at the moment: the graphics in your own eyeball, the end of game consoles. <br><br>  Size will no longer matter <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/2c9/3ab/543/2c93ab54396d1987b7f8a7cdf46d85c3.jpg" width="400" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Every two years, computers double their speed.  If this trend continues to grow, by 2018 the whole system will be placed on an incredibly small device.  This is a gaming device that is similar in size to a mobile phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/539/d05/bd7/539d05bd77da7f9ce73fc4957a2d085a.jpg" width="400" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  However, if the size of the device itself decreases, the screen size will also decrease.  Can we see all the unreal graphics on such a small screen?  The answer to the question - of course, we can.  The human eye becomes a monitor.  Virtual indicator on the retina (virtual retinal display, VRD) is a system that is being developed at the University of Washington.  Images will be projected directly to your eyes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/167/fdc/052/167fdc052d91ca1e9436ec90ca0dd620.jpg" width="400" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  In 2018, this device will immerse you entirely in the virtual world and allow you to see everything differently.  The graphics will be different from the real, but this will not prevent the idea to become incredibly popular. <br><br>  <strong>2023: educational games</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/3d7/eff/093/3d7eff093fac9d106a4bfe9140eeef46.jpg" width="450" height="160" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Brain control <br><br>  The problem of manual control of the game will still exist, this is where the brain control will appear.  Although it sounds like something fictional, companies are developing a smart computer interface that will help to restore people with disabilities.  Hitachi is already testing such a device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/cb5/fc6/1e0/cb5fc61e04c7029033ada95a52683670.jpg" width="400" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Of course, many will think that such revolutionary technologies are unlikely to be used for such stupid purposes as computer games.  However, pessimists can say this to Emotiv, which has already created such a device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/183/9e4/14a/1839e414abab26b51be4971b3ff90eed.jpg" width="400" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Outside of artificial intelligence <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/8ac/dc1/885/8acdc18857cda8e2645ffd5c45f235f2.jpg" width="400" height="250" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  A computer valued at $ 1,000 will surpass all the computational capabilities of the human brain.  This small device (the size of Bluetooth) will be able to create graphics akin to the one that Industrial Light and Magic are now doing for low-cost pictures.  The graphics will still not be realistic, as our brain, as now, will understand that different monsters are only fiction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/abb/83d/e0d/abb83de0de0b8b59bba2ad27a2807914.jpg" width="400" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  <strong>2028: games that do absolutely everything</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/baa/54d/1e4/baa54d1e4e3bb83b670a59d572f48f96.jpg" width="450" height="160" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Computers everywhere <br><br>  If manufacturers continue to create new ‚Äúgizmos‚Äù at their former speed, then by this time the PlayStation 7 will appear. Although this is unlikely, even taking into account that Sony will be ‚Äúin the game‚Äù as before, and even if we are not destroyed scary monsters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/b8d/a25/19e/b8da2519e0957f6a7935474914617c0d.jpg" width="400" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  By that time, the ‚Äúminiaturization‚Äù trend will progress.  If every 2 years the size will be halved, we will use computers that will be a thousand times smaller than the ones we use at the moment.  These will be laptops embedded in a piece of paper. ... and processors embedded in your clothes ... <br><br>  The price of such a "t-shirt-computer" will be quite low, which will allow you not to worry about a computer thing that has been forgotten somewhere.  The idea is that by 2028 computers will be everywhere, performing virtually any task. <br><br>  <strong>2033: The real Matrix, video games that are even smarter than you</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/81d/2d9/1bf/81d2d91bf85e3c3239957f0cb5820cfc.jpg" width="450" height="160" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  According to Raymond Kurzweil, by 2029 the computer will be as smart as a person, and the price will be only $ 1.  And if the technology will also accelerate, then by 2033 we will use computers in size resembling a speck of dust. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/247/c09/5e7/247c095e7ce7efa5839163085bb9d283.jpg" width="400" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Computers are becoming ubiquitous and invisible.  The experience that your parents have received in their entire life, and it is even impossible to compare with the information carried by the computer of the future that fits in your eyes. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/c6f/e31/17c/c6fe3117c806ad6b7d2faaf6e0718379.jpg" width="300" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Sony is already developing special ultrasounds that create true sensory impressions, and you have all 5 sense organs of virtual reality.  Just imagine: a magical world in which you can meet the "Burger King" ("King of the Hamburger") and smell it, see its clothes. <br><br>  As for the games.  It is possible that by that time the gaming industry will reach its final goal: a device that allows gamers to fully enjoy the game.  Yes, most likely, you will need different electrodes embedded in the pleasure centers of the human brain.  However, by 2033 it is very likely that it would be foolish not to implant such electrodes to newly born children. <br><br>  via <a href="http://gamingblog.ru/">blog about games</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26691/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26691/</a></p>
