  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why do 90% of our customers stay with us?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is not joke.  90% of those who called our company stay with us and use the services of our company at least one more time.  I decided not to be wise with the theory and to set forth the main points.  I'm sure someone will come in handy.  Our business is a taxi, but most of the know-how is perfectly applicable in any business. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1) We know people by name.  At the time of the first contact, we will know the name of the client and more than by name, we do not contact him. <br><br>  2) At the time of the next contact, the manager has data on previous orders.  If the database already has some features related, for example, with the client's address - he does not need to tell them again.  The dispatcher tells everything: ‚ÄúDo you have to enter from Yesenin Street, the entrance in the middle of the high section of the house, is it convenient to stand at the ramp?‚Äù.  Most customers like it.

      3) We will definitely inform the clients of the names of the drivers.  "Alexander is coming to you, he has a silver" Caravan ", number 935".  People like not only when they are addressed by name, but also when they can turn. <br><br>  4) We try to send the same driver to the person every time - people like that they can continue the old conversation, that the driver knows their habits. <br><br>  5) If you have to wait for the client - in 90% of cases we are waiting for him for free.  It's easy, people are rarely late much more.  We do not rush them and do not breed for extra grandmothers.  They appreciate it. <br><br>  6) We do not charge extra money for child seats, transporting slightly large animals, luggage in the cabin and other things.  In spite of the fact that the savings are not big, the attention is valuable to people. <br><br>  7) Drivers will know in advance the features of getting to where they are going.  Do not stupid and do not ask the client how to call. <br><br>  8) Of course, drivers always help with luggage. <br><br>  9) We do not call the client when the machine gives in, but invite him.  First we serve the car, and then we invite passengers. <br><br>  10) We definitely call people after the trip and ask if everything went well. <br><br>  11) Drivers never smoke in the presence of a client, even if the client smokes. <br><br>  12) Drivers know which passengers have a favorite radio station.  If they do not know, do not hesitate to ask.  If the children in the cabin - put "Children's Radio". <br><br>  13) Drivers always have candy for those who are rocking. <br><br>  14) Drivers usually have charging for several phone models and inverters for recharging laptops. <br><br>  15) We always return forgotten things in the car.  They are brought to customers.  Of course, for free. <br><br>  16) If it is dark - drivers must bring people as close as possible to the entrance, they will offer to carry them out, they will shine their headlights. <br><br>  17) We always give customers discount cards.  Even if they (so far!) Have not ordered anything.  We allow customers to share discounts with anyone. <br><br>  18) We always offer the client the option that is more convenient and profitable to the client. <br><br>  19) We always wish a happy journey before the trip and thank you after it.  Always do it sincerely. <br><br>  20) We never forget that the statutory "profit" is not possible if the client was at least dissatisfied with anything. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/74524/">https://habr.com/ru/post/74524/</a></p>
