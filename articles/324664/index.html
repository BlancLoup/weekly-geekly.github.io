  <section class="page js-page"><h1>10 main difficulties on the way to adaptation DevOps</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  According to the Quali survey, more than 2,000 directors from the IT industry *, DevOps' adaptation to improve its workflow and productivity is impeded by very different problems: from the inherited infrastructure to the personal preferences of specialists and the lack of the necessary culture. <br><br>  The authors of the study note that more than half of the respondents (54%) admitted that there was no IaaS (that is, an infrastructure that is available to them as a service) and that they use tickets to manage the infrastructure.  At the same time, only 23% of respondents could have infrastructure deployed within one day, for 33% of survey participants this process can take up to a month, and for 26% even more so. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fde/9b6/80f/fde9b680f0164ac9be2dd79ea7430174.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúToday we see a great emphasis on speed, flexibility and the need to do everything quickly, and the clouds and the as-a-service approach <i>[IaaS, PaaS, etc.</i>  <i>- approx.</i>  <i>trans.]</i> contribute to this.  In the survey results, we saw that the lack of access to infrastructure-as-a-service is a very narrow throat, ‚Äùthe authors from Quali emphasized.

    <h2>  Challenges and Solutions </h2><br>  What does the whole list of main difficulties on the way to DevOps look like and what will help in solving them? <br><br><h3>  1. Lack of culture </h3><br>  Companies need to focus on building a culture with interactions with common (shared by all participants) goals.  It is also important to find employees who can lead DevOps activities within the organization. <br><br><h3>  2. Test Automation </h3><br>  Many companies discard testing automation by focusing on CI / CD processes.  However, continuous testing is the key to success in DevOps.  From the very beginning, safety issues must be taken into account. <br><br><h3>  3. Legacy systems </h3><br>  Accounting for outdated infrastructure and applications should be an integral part of your DevOps implementation plans.  Installing new equipment or software and their simultaneous coexistence with older systems is always difficult. <br><br><h3>  4. The complexity of the application </h3><br>  When changing the architecture of the application, lay the possibility of using SaaS, cloud infrastructure, containers. <br><br><h3>  5. No DevOps Plan </h3><br>  Create a clear plan that includes milestones, responsible and concrete results. <br><br><h3>  6. Environmental management </h3><br>  Standardization and automation of working with complex environments for DevOps can be achieved using containers from cloud service providers and other off-the-shelf tools. <br><br><h3>  7. Lack of skills </h3><br>  Teams need to train DevOps.  The company should standardize processes and general operating procedures. <br><br><h3>  8. Budget </h3><br>  Remember that Open Source does not mean free of charge: you have to pay for the integration and complexity of operation. <br><br><h3>  9. Unsuitable tools </h3><br>  Avoid the use of disparate utilities (loved by individual developers, and not well integrated with other infrastructure) - otherwise it will increase costs. <br><br><h3>  10. Leadership support </h3><br>  Tell your company executives about the benefits of DevOps in order to enlist their support in finance and resources. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/457/009/505/4570095057824840b74026e2d5f2ab70.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Summarizing </h2><br>  It is significant that even the most important difficulties that took the first 3 places in this ‚Äúrating‚Äù received a rather small percentage of the votes: for 14% the main barrier is culture, for 13% - test automation, for 12% - obsolete systems.  The resulting variability suggests that the introduction of DevOps practices should take into account many disparate factors, which, like DevOps, are associated not only with technologies, but also with people, and with the processes themselves.  Moreover, if many of them are common to all companies, then some may be specific. <br><br>  PS For fans of statistics: Jenkins (21%), Docker (16%), Puppet (14%) and Chef (13%) are the most popular software tools used by respondents to organize DevOps. <br><br>  <i>* <a href="http://www.quali.com/">Quali</a> is a company with Israeli origins and headquarters in the United States that specializes in cloud technologies, DevOps and BizOps.</i>  <i>The survey was conducted among visitors to such major IT events last year as Cisco Live, VMWorld, Jenkins World, and others.</i> <br><br>  <i>Some of the refinements to the survey were taken from the Madison Moore article in the <a href="http://sdtimes.com/quali-survey-infrastructure-fragmentation-toolsets-among-top-barriers-devops-adoption/">SD Times</a> .</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/324664/">https://habr.com/ru/post/324664/</a></p>
