February 13, a conference for Dev2Dev Just.Net software developers will take place.  All our previous events were focused on a wide range of interests and technologies.  This year we decided to try to hold a specialized conference!  Come, it will be interesting.  Admission is free and free.

      The concept of Dev2Dev community events is simple: free entry, quality content and lots of communication for participants and speakers.  The event is first of all fun, dating and pumping energy.  Strong reports and interesting speakers make this possible, but the event itself is created by the participants. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The event program is rich <br><br>  <b>Alexander Zimin: Nemerle.</b>  <b>Metaprogramming in .NET</b> <br>  Alexander is the founder of his own company.  He will tell you how to solve non-trivial tasks within .Net in a very elegant way.  In the report we will get acquainted with the Nemerle programming language and compare it with other dotNet languages. <br><br>  <b>Dmitry Kozhevnikov: Micro-orm for life</b> <br>  Dmitry is not the first time speaking at the conference and now he decided not to delve into the patterns, but to tell about his daily life, about working with data.  The speaker will share his personal experience with micro-ORM and tell what their strength is! <br><br>  <b>Andrey Molotkov: Evolution of corporate applications</b> <br>  Andrei is working Software Architect at an unknown Krasnoyarsk plant.  =) He will tell how the use of service-oriented architecture will help in working with endless inherited code, outdated technologies and sluggish monoliths in enterprise projects. <br><br>  <b>Alexander Dyatlov: ASP.NET MVC outside of Hello World</b> <br>  ASP.NET MVC is a simple and common tool.  But building a large web application based on it is not so simple.  Tutorials do not reveal the problems arising from the growth of the project.  Frequently, initially harmonious architecture is spread with each following iteration.  Alexander will share his development experience, talk about the main problems and the solutions he chooses. <br><br>  <b>Artyom Akulyakov: What we should build DAL</b> <br>  Artem, this time, will talk about working with data.  As we all know, everything is not as simple as it seems at first glance.  On the one hand, we need performance, on the other hand, all the best practices dictate the principle of persistence ignorance to us, and on the third, we also want to write beautiful and clear code.  How to find a balance between all of this?  This will be discussed, and the most important speaker will share his personal experience! <br><br>  <b>Denis Tsvetchich: Modular structure of the application, to be or not to be?</b> <br>  Denis runs Software Architect at Astrosoft.  As part of the report, Denis will talk about what approaches exist to the organization of the modular structure of applications, in which frameworks they are implemented and for which tasks each approach benefits. <br><br>  <b>Denis Zawserchinsky: Everything will be in Azhur.</b> <br>  Denis is a leading developer at Aspirity.  In the life cycle of each application, there comes a time when it is time to provide it to the audience.  When using Microsoft technologies it is logical to pay attention to the cloud platform.  Denis will tell, and the most interesting will show how to do, so that your project would be in Azhura. <br><br>  Well, for a snack, as always after-party. <br><br>  The full program, coordinates and registration for the event on the page <a href="http://dev2dev.ru/">dev2dev.ru</a> . <br>  Our group in VK - <a href="http://vk.com/dev2dev">vk.com/dev2dev</a> - there all the news, spoilers and additional information. <br>  Video from the conference will be posted on <a href="http://youtube.com/channel/UCZayZ2dHuYdwtV5cRwM_23A">youtube.com/channel/UCZayZ2dHuYdwtV5cRwM_23A</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/276841/">https://habr.com/ru/post/276841/</a></p>
