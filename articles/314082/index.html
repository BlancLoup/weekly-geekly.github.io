      So, the ‚Äúproduct‚Äù is created, there is some kind of marketing and first employees.  Amounts "drip" on the current account, it's time to grow further!  And at this moment, as Pavlov‚Äôs dog‚Äôs reflex, 90% of the entrepreneurs in the head have a question: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúWhy not introduce a CRM system?‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Went process ... Search for options ... Contractors ... Amo, 1C or Bitrix 24 ... <br><br>  But intuition is sitting on the shoulder and prompts: ‚ÄúMan.  Something is wrong.  Somehow everything is very vague in this automation. ‚Äù <br><br>  The guys came, ‚Äúautomators,‚Äù put in terms and, after lulling vigilance, installed everything as they themselves saw (in the best case) or simply copied the standard configurations from a similar business model to yours.  Even better would fit the verb - ‚Äúpulled‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/908/88a/9d5/90888a9d5ef6b81f5e60b312d2761e14.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Result?  CRM works at 30% of its capabilities, management is ‚Äúnot intuitive‚Äù, instructions are needed for everything, many points do not coincide with practice, employees are sabotaging. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What do we get "at the exit"?  Return to Excel, spent time and money.  Or the use of CRM, as an organizer.  And this process is akin to repairing an apartment - I want everything to be excellent and in fact it drains energy. <br><br>  It takes a quarter and again returns to the problem.  New cycle, new contractors, new CRM and in a circle. <br><br>  <b>Why is this happening and what could be the solution?</b> <br><br>  This happens in Russia everywhere.  We often jump over one key step, which is called "systematization". <br><br>  By the way, do you know that Russia occupies almost the very last place in labor productivity ( <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/management/articles/2015/08/10/604195-oesr-nizkaya-proizvoditelnost">according to the Vedomosti newspaper</a> )? <br>  For 1 man-hour, we produce a product for $ 25.9, which is less than in the most ‚Äúlagging behind‚Äù in Europe, Latvia (27.6) and Poland (29.7), almost 1.5 times less than in Greece (36.2) and twice less than the average eurozone countries - 55.9 US dollars. <br><br>  The ‚Äúroot‚Äù of both of these problems - the introduction of CRM and low labor productivity - lies in several factors, but one of the main factors is <b>chaotic, ‚Äúnon-systemic‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-optimized‚Äù business processes.</b> <br><br>  Here is another confirmation.  Do you know why experienced participants of the automation market - 1C company - have so many ‚Äúproducts‚Äù and often people speak of it as ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù? <br><br>  Because 1C worked according to the rules of the market.  Russian enterprises often operate on the principle of a "multi-armed monster" with a huge number of "pieces".  Everything is in chaos.  And they turned to 1C with a logical request: "And now automate me all this!". <br><br>  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis article is the preliminary systematization (transformation of the business into a pipeline) and further simplification of all processes with the subsequent automation of an understandable and simple mechanism that can be easily scaled later through branches, dealers and franchises. <br><br>  Here is the metaphor.  Systematization, as the nucleus of the atom.  Around which circling "electrons": sales, marketing, finance, hiring employees automation.  Without this ‚Äúcore‚Äù, all elements move chaotically.  And its presence centers all these elements. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/35a/109/394/35a1093946c021ac0342f549f63a36c8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In conclusion, summarizing: <br><br><blockquote>  Systematization is the process of creating constant repetitive actions (presented in graphic style), in the form of business processes, regulations, scripts, templates, documents, videos.  As well as the establishment of a basic, simplest business analytics, understanding of key figures that directly affect the growth of the company's profits.  With a well-defined portrait of the best employees and target audience (based on indicators). </blockquote><br><br>  And when the "fog cleared", everything is before your eyes.  There is a screening of excess and focusing on 20% of actions, employees, customers, products, which give 80% of the result.  Business becomes such a neat "box" that is easy to automate and scale. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/314082/">https://habr.com/ru/post/314082/</a></p>
