Simply remove or add new blocks to the graphical process model. <br><br>  Typical processes can be configured for regular execution automatically: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9cf/b1f/256/9cfb1f256caa8b5a90628cc4c5ee28f8.jpg"><br><br><h3>  <font color="black">Control and Analytics Panels</font> </h3><br>  The manager is provided with summary reports on all company performance indicators: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d9e/c1c/e91/d9ec1ce9182a1be23f591e91793bbf7c.jpg"><br><br><h3>  <font color="black">Process analysis using indicators</font> </h3><br>  A summary of all types of business processes of the company with an indication of the number of running instances and their status, planned and actual time indicators is presented in the process execution report: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b79/fea/c21/b79feac21bf64b0ce6eafe2b7372a830.jpg"><br><br>  Also reporting on the status of processes can be displayed in graphical form.  The status of operations (tasks) by process is marked with the help of color: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/331/9b6/e50/3319b6e5024f554586d11581cc634b32.jpg"><br><br><h3>  <font color="black">Relationship of strategic objectives and KPI</font> </h3><br>  The influence of KPIs of employees and divisions on the overall results of the company can be seen in the example of such an element as calculated indicators. <br><br>  Estimated indicators are total values ‚Äã‚Äãthat are added from a number of key indicators using a special formula.  For example, to calculate the value of "Finance", the indicators "Sales" and "Marginal Profit" are added: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a7d/d6b/e2c/a7dd6be2ce0a40335ef2577f97892858.jpg"><br><br>  The terms of this formula can be flexibly configured for each calculated indicator. <br>  The relationship between the calculated indicator and the KPI is graphically shown in the Executive Panel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eaa/732/ed7/eaa732ed716bb434f33fb6dc233e942a.jpg"><br><br>  The view model can be customized for a specific user. <br><br><h3>  <font color="black">General impression of the system</font> </h3><br>  The ‚ÄúProcess Management‚Äù solution based on 1C: Enterprise 8 presents an extensive set of tools for building the company's business processes.  There is a graphical editor, tools for monitoring / improving business processes, and custom panels for visual display of indicators. <br><br>  KPI here is not just an optional "appendage", but an element of controlling the company's process model. <br><br>  All this is realized with the inherent scrupulousness of the products of the 1C range.  For example, the construction of each stage of the process chain requires the addition of a large amount of related data. <br><br><h2>  <font color="black"><b>ELMA BPM Suite</b></font> </h2><br>  <a href="http://www.elma-bpm.ru/">ELMA</a> is a BPM class system and at the same time a platform for developing modules and solutions aimed at various aspects of a business.  The ELMA-based KPI module serves to visually display employee performance indicators, which are considered in relation to the company's strategic goals. <br><br>  A complete business solution that combines BPM functionality, process metrics, strategy management tools and staff motivation tools is offered in <a href="http://www.elma-bpm.ru/product/bpm_suite/">the ELMA BPM Suite</a> . <br>  Consider what functionality is supplied by the developer in this package. <br><br><h3>  <font color="black">Modeling</font> </h3><br>  ELMA Designer is a configurator that graphically displays the organizational structure of a company.  To do this, the user has the entire set of simple geometric shapes and elements. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/726/d60/5c4/726d605c4311346c2bef8bc92d3e3b79.jpg"><br><br>  In the Designer, the strategic goals of the company and KPI indicators are also assigned to certain employees and departments.  Logically connected with each other, indicators form a tree of indicators. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aec/fcd/7ea/aecfcd7ea29cf116d1e5b12ad307a11a.jpg"><br><br><h3>  <font color="black">Control and Analytics Panels</font> </h3><br>  In the ELMA system there are convenient Dashboards with graphs and tables, which show the dynamics of changes both in all and in the selected indicators: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/afc/58f/676/afc58f676f957f472ec3053f12fda766.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c4a/a43/d2f/c4aa43d2f34f510a5206f83d29047345.jpg"><br><br>  The sum of employee performance reflects its overall performance.  This is implemented in such an element of the system as the ‚ÄúPerformance Matrix‚Äù, in addition to key indicators including a tool for monitoring the implementation of SMART tasks (priority tasks set for a specified period), the level of performance discipline and the manager's assessment. <br><br>  The weight of these parameters, a set of key indicators, the frequency of their accounting and other elements of the efficiency matrix are configured separately for each user / user group by the system administrator: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/49b/06c/e3b/49b06ce3bfbd3406279fd9e10b8a6105.jpg"><br><br>  SMART-tasks - a tool that deserves special attention. <br>  As I said above, it serves for setting priority and strategically significant tasks for employees.  Already at the stage of formulating a task, it can be linked to a specific strategic goal of the company.  This underlines the significance of the result achieved by the employee for the success of the entire company: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/31c/d32/ad4/31cd32ad46a5dbca1c858172a888fecb.jpg"><br><br>  Thus, ELMA logically links the company's strategy and SMART tasks, which are one of the components of an employee's efficiency matrix. <br>  All the components of the effectiveness matrix in their entirety influence the size of the employee's bonus, being one of the effective means of motivating the staff. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ade/c48/906/adec489069bb733bdc179fa0ddc5060c.jpg"><br><br>  Now how goals and indicators are displayed in the web interface. <br><br><h3>  <font color="black">Process control with KPI</font> </h3><br>  For each process, you can assign a set of indicators and metrics that will serve as controllers for its execution: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ad4/05b/969/ad405b969cd2187d46e3df9bb01b10c7.jpg"><br><br>  For processes, you can customize color indicators, each of which is associated with a specific indicator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/931/fc7/ef4/931fc7ef4d0bb551f7319ee7925b4a71.jpg"><br><br>  The processes that are executed in the normal mode are marked in green in the Process Monitor, ‚Äúlagging‚Äù or ‚Äúproblem‚Äù in yellow and red, respectively: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b00/0a8/a48/b000a8a48bca4d63c01cbe1e5e710f71.jpg"><br><br><h3>  <font color="black">Relationship of strategic objectives and KPI</font> </h3><br>  The Goals Map graphically shows the company's activities and strategic goals for the current period.  The level of "nesting" of the goal map depends on how branched the organizational structure of the company.  Each division has its own goals, and they reflect the specifics of its activities: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e92/b82/782/e92b82782c18f8d8c42abcf55c3a0db8.png"><br><br><h3>  <font color="black">General impression of the system</font> </h3><br>  ELMA in the BPM Suite delivery option is a complete system for modeling, managing and controlling business processes. <br>  Much attention is paid to product developers to record KPIs, which is reflected in such components of the system as performance indicators, which can be flexibly adjusted in accordance with the organizational structure, company processes and linked to strategic goals, efficiency matrix, SMART tasks.  Dynamics of indicators is reflected in graphics and user dashboards.  All these tools allow you to control the quality of the execution of business processes. <br><br><h2>  <b><font color="black">Business studio</font></b> </h2><br>  The system of business modeling of enterprise processes, interesting in its functionality and execution.  The developer is a domestic IT vendor of the GC "Modern management technologies".  The range of tasks that <a href="http://www.businessstudio.ru/">Business Studio</a> allows to solve includes modeling and controlling business processes, designing BSC strategic goals with reference to KPI indicators of employees and divisions, simulation modeling and analysis of the company's balance sheet, QMS support. <br><br><h3>  <font color="black">Modeling</font> </h3><br>  The system supports popular notations for creating business process models: IDEF0, BPMN, EPC, Basic Flowchart, Cross Functional Flowchart.  With the help of a block diagram and other graphical elements, the structure of a business process is modeled: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f2/ba9/a0c/2f2ba9a0cfafd47885b40d3eb0a287b2.jpg"><br><br><h3>  <font color="black">Process Analysis with KPI Indicators</font> </h3><br>  The system has a mechanism for tracking the dynamics, such as controlling processes: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/286/5b2/7ae/2865b27ae73b605e6950e8c3f7e7d20d.jpg"><br><br><h3>  <font color="black">Control and Analytics Panels</font> </h3><br>  There are convenient Dashboards in the system to familiarize yourself with the company's indicators: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/40b/dd5/f5c/40bdd5f5c1380ee047c5f4223ba84428.jpg"><br><br>  as well as tools for analyzing the associated key performance indicators, both own and business units: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13a/0dd/1c5/13a0dd1c5ed9208a7abd7aedeb108ee4.jpg"><br><br>  The dynamics of changes in these indicators are clearly visible in the corresponding diagrams: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/998/568/beb/998568beb91627911382bc7b9e0ebccf.jpg"><br><br><h3>  <font color="black">Relationship of strategic indicators and KPI</font> </h3><br>  The strategic map clearly shows the activities, goals and indicators of the company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eab/1fe/464/eab1fe4643baf2254dfed47bfe7fb93b.jpg"><br><br>  However, to study the dynamics of certain indicators, it is necessary to delve into them.  In my opinion, this makes it difficult to form a complete picture of what is happening in the company. <br><br><h3>  <font color="black">General impression of the system</font> </h3><br>  The Business Studio system has developed functionality for modeling and analyzing business processes using indicators, charts and reports.  However, controls and process improvements are not provided for. <br><br><h2>  <b><font color="black">ARIS Express 2.4</font></b> </h2><br>  The program for modeling business processes and enterprise management from the German company <a href="http://www.softwareag.com/corporate/default.asp">Software AG</a> .

The main features of the free system are: <br><br><h3>  <font color="black">Modeling</font> </h3><br>  A convenient environment for modeling business processes using flowcharts (takes into account such entities as events, actions and positions): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a51/196/7e2/a511967e2cc34c3387b3b9bd31e3f53e.jpg"><br><br>  Graphical environment for building process logic and hierarchy (process landscape): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2c7/882/c49/2c7882c49df12dbf9e433007bebdcbb0.jpg"><br><br>  The routes of approvals, processing requests and documents are built in accordance with the organizational structure and process model of the company: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7d3/10a/df6/7d310adf67b71dc95dc05f65fbbf0e80.jpg"><br><br>  The developers of ARIS Express 2.4 did not ignore such an aspect as personnel performance indicators. <br><br><h3>  <font color="black">Control and Analytics Panels</font> </h3><br>  In the free delivery is not provided.  But in the ARIS Business Strategy product version there are deshboards for tracking KPI and BCS. <br><br><h3>  <font color="black">Connection of strategic goals with KPI</font> </h3><br>  In the Whiteboard component (analogous to a conventional wallboard for writing with a marker), the company's KPI indicators are set in accordance with the competence of the employee or department, and strategic goals.  Employee performance indicators formulated using elements such as the KPI Instance (in translation - "variants of KPI indicators"). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/36c/19b/7c1/36c19b7c157a5456a7a6765d99423c18.jpg"><br><br><h3>  <font color="black">Impression of the system</font> </h3><br>  ARIS Xpress is a free simulation system with a simple and clear interface.  That is why it is used in teaching students the basics of describing business processes and small companies.  However, it is impossible to call it a full-fledged BPM system, as there are no management tools, improvement and control of business processes in it. <br><br><h2>  <font color="black"><b>Conclusion</b></font> </h2><br>  So, KPI accounting tools are an important structural component of BPM systems, combining the means of forming a company's strategy and indicators to track how effectively this strategy is implemented. <br><br>  Each of the integrated BPM + KPI solutions has its own functional specifics.  Some of them are universal business solutions capable of adjusting to the specifics of almost any company, while others are focused on narrow target groups.  A number of systems offer the user full functionality of BPM and KPI, a number of others are, in fact, only process configurators. <br><br>  One of the tasks of KPI tools in a BPM system is to control the execution of processes.  Not all of the systems presented in the review have implemented this, there are also differences in the ways of implementation. <br><br>  The relationship between strategic objectives and performance indicators has been implemented in different ways. <br>  Brief results on the considered systems are given in the table: <br><br><br><table border="1" cellpadding="15"><tbody><tr><td>  <b>System</b> </td><td>  <b>System type</b> </td><td>  <b>Display of strategic goals</b> </td><td>  <b>Employee scoreboard</b> </td><td>  <b>Ability to adjust processes on the go</b> </td><td>  <b>Mobile support</b> </td></tr><tr><td><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de5/72c/73c/de572c73cc7a2b8d10f8a5b976ab1fa1.jpg"></div><br></td><td>  Business process modeling system </td><td>  Strategic map </td><td>  Plan-actual analysis of areas of responsibility </td><td>  not </td><td>  not </td></tr><tr><td><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d5a/0ff/229/d5a0ff2294591956c834b8f7616a0d41.jpg"></div><br></td><td>  Business modeling system </td><td>  Control tab, goals and indicators </td><td>  Control Module </td><td>  not </td><td>  not </td></tr><tr><td><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/18c/d08/e5a/18cd08e5a2ef0764df0d13fb40cdf3e0.jpg"></div><br></td><td>  The system of business process management, performance and interaction in the company </td><td>  Detailed map of the objectives of the company, its divisions and activities </td><td>  Efficiency matrix </td><td>  there is </td><td>  yes, there is <a href="http://www.elma-bpm.ru/functions/modules/ipad.html">ELMA</a> solution <a href="http://www.elma-bpm.ru/functions/modules/ipad.html">for iPad</a> </td></tr><tr><td><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ed/17f/128/8ed17f1286168b1c968685339d066058.jpg"></div><br></td><td>  Business Modeling and Analysis System </td><td>  Strategic map </td><td>  Employee card </td><td>  there is </td><td>  not </td></tr><tr><td><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/847/f4f/63a/847f4f63ad67ea81d5509a48e0aef8c7.jpg"></div><br></td><td>  Business process modeling system </td><td>  Causal diagram </td><td>  Charts </td><td>  not </td><td>  yes ipad </td></tr><tr><td><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6bd/d54/27b/6bdd5427b00088d181ac7462de49cd12.jpg"></div><br></td><td>  Business Process Automation and Management System </td><td>  Goal hierarchy </td><td>  Head Panel </td><td>  there is </td><td>  yes ipad </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/220575/">https://habr.com/ru/post/220575/</a></p>
