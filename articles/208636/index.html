  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Six Reasons for Apple to Embed Video Trailers on the App Store</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It so happened that we in Alconost do not only translate and localize, but also <a href="https://alconost.com/services/video-for-apps%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dtranslation%26utm_content%3D6_prichin_trailers_Appstore">sell videos</a> for IT products.  The news about the first video trailer of the app in the App Store inspired us very much and we decided to translate an article about what the developers and users of iOS devices will bring video clips, and why Apple should hurry up with launching the video in its Store. <br><br>  <i>Translated <a href="http://alconost.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dtranslation%26utm_content%3D6_prichin_trailers_Appstore">by localization company Alconost</a> .</i> <br><br> <a href="http://alconost.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dtranslation%26utm_content%3D6_prichin_trailers_Appstore"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1cb/dc0/933/1cbdc093333a5245017c976f93921836.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Every month in the App Store there are a lot of competing applications with similar names and descriptions, and choosing between them is not easy.  That is why the video trailer for the game <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/11/21/apple-posts-its-first-video-trailer-on-the-app-store/">Clumsy Ninja</a> , which appeared in the British App Store, was the first for this platform that caused a storm of emotions: this may symbolize that Apple plans to introduce such an option for other applications.  Although Apple‚Äôs plans are unclear until the end, there are many arguments in favor of adding video trailers to the App Store, both in terms of business benefits and user satisfaction.

    <h4>  1. Video is priceless ... </h4><br>  Visual appeal is the best way to attract attention.  And the video is suitable for this purpose much better than two-dimensional images.  According <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2013/11/27/if-a-picture-says-1000-words-than-video-is-priceless/">to the researchers</a> , adding videos to business sites increases the likelihood of converting visitors to customers by 74%.  Just watching high-quality videos is what people like more than reading.  So, the transfer of key business information in this form often provides a shortcut to global popularity.  Recall at least YouTube, which has become one of the most visited sites in the world in just a couple of years thanks to this principle, monthly increasing the audience by 136 million new users. <br><br><h4>  2. ... and it already exists on Google Play </h4><br>  When it comes to innovation, Apple cannot afford to give Android a head start.  But the fact that Google Play has already allowed you to download video trailers for applications for some time can be a cause for concern.  Although this is unlikely to push users to change the platform, it is unclear: why allow a competitor to bypass themselves?  Most reviewers agree that the <a href="http://www.hngn.com/articles/17919/20131122/apple-takes-page-google-debuts-video-trailers-apps-app-store.htm">App Store should follow the example of Google</a> in this matter and provide additional options for visual presentation of applications.  In the end, not in the manner of Apple resist any technological change - especially those that have proven to be effective in practice. <br><br><h4>  3. The best representation of the functionality and application interface </h4><br>  Some things are simply impossible to explain with static pictures and words.  Each application has its own interactive features, which are revealed depending on the specific actions of the user, and it is almost impossible to fully explore the application using only screenshots.  But video trailers allow potential users to almost ‚Äúlive‚Äù familiarize themselves with the functionality of the application and study the specifics of its interface even before installation.  Not to mention the fact that the abundance of advanced features and a cool interface can be the main reasons for buying - especially when these features are emphasized by a professionally made video trailer. <br><br><h4>  4. An excellent marketing tool for developers. </h4><br>  For developers, the transition from screenshots to video trailers in order to promote applications is an opportunity to be noticed.  And for the App Store, in turn, this guarantees relevance: as with the technologies of the new generation, and among the users of the new generation.  In addition to actually stimulating purchases in the app store itself, a well-made video can be used to promote an application on social networks and on manufacturers' websites.  True, producing a good video can sometimes be expensive and time consuming, but there are plenty of ways to make it without a transcendental budget.  Some developers have already removed high-quality application trailers, but when it becomes possible to place them directly on the App Store page, developers will become more interested in producing video to showcase their creations. <br><br><h4>  5. People share videos more often than any other content. </h4><br>  Social networks have conquered the whole world, turning the exchange of information between users into a powerful force that can make any application world famous in a very short time.  Users, in turn, are more likely to share multimedia content than content in simpler formats: compared to plain text or links, multimedia content is 12 times more common.  And if we take into account that about 46% of users immediately after watching a video perform targeted actions (like, repost, registration, etc.), then it becomes obvious why everyone was so worried about the imminent appearance of video trailers in the App Store. <br><br><h4>  6. This is required by the market. </h4><br>  Talking about video trailers is not news for readers who are closely following the development of the mobile application market.  In fact, users began to demand technical support for video almost from the moment the App Store was launched in July 2008.  Many iOS developers believe that it is necessary to simplify the search and familiarization with high-quality applications, and video trailers could be one of the possible solutions.  Since usage satisfaction is a key factor affecting the personal choice of a mobile platform, Apple would have to listen to user requests and make video trailers a standard option for all available applications. <br><br>  <b>About the translator</b> <br><br>  The article is translated in Alconost. <br><br>  Alconost is engaged in the <a href="https://alconost.com/services/software-localization%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dtranslation%26utm_content%3D6_prichin_trailers_Appstore">localization of applications, games and websites</a> in 60 languages.
