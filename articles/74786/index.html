  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ricoh has released a replaceable matrix camera, GXR</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The key elements of any device today are the matrix that captures the image, the processor that processes the signal from the matrix and the lens that ‚Äúdraws‚Äù the picture (ask any photographer, it ‚Äúdraws‚Äù the lens).  It is these elements that <a href="http://ricoh.com/r_dc/gxr/">will become replaceable in the new device</a> .  Yes, the unit with the matrix, the processor and the lens changes in the apparatus.  Naturally, the case remains with a button, a flash, a screen, and someone else has a viewfinder.  While shells, however, is not enough (one), but in the future the situation threatens to change. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3ad/729/df4/3ad729df4b1345942bd600f82d7f28ce.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The originality of the approach has always been the hallmark of Ricoh - they were the first to produce waterproof and unbreakable cameras, cameras that glue HDR, as well as a whole bunch of other innovations that today have almost become standard in compacts.  Actually, this is not surprising - the company makes niche products, not trying to please the mass consumer.  Accordingly, the price of the devices is very close to expensive technologies that no one has yet introduced just for this reason.

The new option chosen by Ricoh is that a part of the body will now be replaceable, and delusional rumors about ‚ÄúI have flashed my device and inserted a new matrix into it‚Äù will soon become a reality. <br><br>  In the meantime, we have an extremely original version, which has one major drawback - the key elements that are replaceable in it are changing with a whole block, while most manufacturers carry them (the matrix with the processor into the case, the lens with the motor separately) and feel great .  The fact is that the rest of the body, in fact, has in itself only a screen, which also tends to change with progress. <br><br>  The manufacturer did not hesitate to throw a pebble at the competitors - the device will be ‚Äúsmaller than micro 4/3‚Äù, which is considered the most compact among the devices with APS-C.  Why the latter standard was chosen as a reference point is also clear - two interchangeable modules were released with the device, A12 (50mm / 2.5 macro lens, 12.3 megapixel APS-C resolution CMOS) and S10 (24-72 mm / 2.5-4.4 lens). VC, CCD matrix of dimension 1 / 1.7 ‚Äù, resolution 10 Mp). <br><br>  The reasons for this decision are quite clear: protection against dust and dirt is on top, because  the image capturing unit changes completely, and the matrix here becomes actually part of the lens, moreover, it is precisely due to this that the manufacturer has achieved compactness, it is possible not to count the design for a dozen lenses that need to be brought to the standard, and do everything individually in each case - for example if the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãsmaller, the lens will be smaller, as well as the working segment, respectively, and the interchangeable module with a zoom lens will be approximately the same size as the block with a fifty-kopeck on the APS-C.  At the same time, you get the opportunity to shoot both on a compact and practically on a digital rangefinder with a large sensor, combining the advantages of both systems (compacts have compactness and bridging - quality).  In fact, it is the Ricoh GXR that is the first full-fledged bridge machine. <br><br>  As always, the issue of price policy became weak in the apparatus.  The device in Europe will cost ‚Ç¨ 460 (19,550 rubles), and this is just a ‚Äúcarcass‚Äù, but replaceable modules will require an additional ‚Ç¨ 670, in the case of A12 (28,475 rubles), and ‚Ç¨ 370, in the case of S10 (15,725 rubles). ).  In addition, an electron-optical viewfinder (‚Ç¨ 250) and an external flash (‚Ç¨ 270) are also available for this system.  If you count everything together, the amount is impressive, but the Ricoh devices, except for the budget series R, have never been cheap. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/74786/">https://habr.com/ru/post/74786/</a></p>
