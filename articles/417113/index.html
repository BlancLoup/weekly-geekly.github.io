Subsequently, I worked in many other industries: aviation, military, automotive and gas.  Below you see images of some of my projects. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qy/b6/hu/qyb6huw7ih6stszlwh8c9rw3m9i.jpeg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fi/hs/34/fihs34o6cgrhozf6-wp7okw-axo.jpeg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ey/wn/4g/eywn4gy5pw9zicpuew92ihqpese.jpeg"><br><br>  I left Italy in connection with my work, it was in 2006.  Eight years lived in the Middle East, in Qatar, and since 2014 I live in Moscow. <br><br><h3>  3D modeling </h3><br>  I work as a design engineer, I have extensive experience with 3D CAD (I use SolidWorks) and FEM / CFD (ANSYS).  I dealt with CAD 3D for the first time in 1997, when the first economically acceptable software (Solid Edge and SolidWorks) appeared on the market. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9q/tk/zm/9qtkzmghccwx3ftlqmw9henpdsq.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Introduction to 3D printing </h3><br>  I first encountered a 3D printer in 1988, as part of a visit to the FIAT research center.  Then the 3D printer cost as flat and was the size of a cabinet.  I remember how he struck me.  The ability to draw an object, and after a few hours to take it in hand, seemed like a fantasy.  Twenty five years later, in 2013, I had the opportunity to purchase my first 3D printer, it was <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/manufacturer-flashforge.html">Flashforge</a> Creator Dual Extruder. <br><br>  Now I am working with a Raise3D N1 Dual printer, which has made some changes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/16/nc/a-/16nca-aj5yl9gnefeowd5yhxgye.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  How to choose equipment </h3><br>  I chose this car after a long search on the Internet.  My choice is based on the following factors: the possibility of <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/blog/obzor-vysokotemperaturnyh-fdm-plastikov-dlja-promyshlennoj-3d-pechati/">high-temperature</a> <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/materiali/materiali-pc/pc-polikarbonat-fl33-natural.html">polycarbonate</a> printing, the possibility of making further improvements in the firmware and software, and compatibility with <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/blog/obzor-simplify3d-40-novaja-versija-slajsera/">Simplify3D</a> - the software that I use in preparing for printing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/df/e1/oy/dfe1oy51ff6ccj-e-ahq0hmnibw.jpeg"><br><br>  I chose <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/soft/simplify3d.html">Simplify3D software</a> because of its flexibility and ability to vary printing parameters.  My parts are often very complex, require accuracy in size and full control over print parameters.  Considering all the advantages of this software over free counterparts, I believe that the price of a license justifies itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uv/xf/gw/uvxfgwtfqm4w6gyb5j6nxk9rkp0.jpeg"><br><br>  I bought the Raise3D N1 Dual at the Top 3D Shop in February.  Then I was struck by another printer - <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/picaso-3d-designer-x-pro.html">PICASO 3D Designer X Pro</a> , but, unfortunately, its price exceeded my budget, although I am sure that it is worth it.  In addition, at that time he had not yet entered the free market. <br><br><h3>  What benefits did the printer bring? </h3><br>  On this printer, I can easily print parts from complex materials such as polycarbonate and <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/materiali/fl33-pa-nylon.html">nylon</a> .  The print resolution remains impressive and reaches 0.005 mm (with a nozzle of 0.2 mm).  Print area is also impressive.  A big plus can also be called a large convenient touchscreen for settings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9h/ck/mj/9hckmja3-_mb2u__lhg0aawd3dg.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  What tasks does it apply to </h3><br>  Despite the change of work in 2005, when I retrained from a design engineer to a project manager, I never left engineering. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/r3/gz/f7/r3gzf7gztxalilocktjmexfufg4.jpeg"><br><br>  Now this is one of my hobbies.  It allows me to relax and get a charge of cheerfulness. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ug/2a/xh/ug2axhdqm5r-g4jji7ovo04714o.jpeg"><br><br>  In addition, I am engaged in modeling: I am building models of ships, aircraft and tanks from wood and plastic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pf/ht/yz/pfhtyzyppqchqug7hxb7hbu3p9a.jpeg"><br><br>  3D printers once again aroused in me a passion for designing machines and raised it to a higher level.  Some of my projects are available on my page on <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/gahwar/designs">Thingiverse</a> , while others are stored on my hard drive, pending completion and implementation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vt/d5/q_/vtd5q_aj0-8hmduglzvto9ogedo.jpeg"><br><br>  Now I am working on a very ambitious project, a new type of gas turbine for aeromodelling.  This is a complex and interesting project that requires knowledge in various fields of physics and applied mechanics, such as structural mechanics, vibration mechanics, disk mechanics, hydrodynamics, aerodynamics, the theory of lubricants, metallurgy, heat transfer, combustion dynamics, etc. <br><br>  All this is complicated by the miniature dimensions of parts for such an engine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pr/7-/n9/pr7-n9vgvex9dgvunzhyshps9qq.jpeg"><br><br>  The basis of this project was the well-known and widely used KJ66.  This engine was originally designed taking into account the production of most of its parts on a 3D printer made of aluminum, titanium, hastelloy and inconel.  In addition, it uses some common technical solutions from aeronautics that have never been used in aeronautical modeling before - it was impossible.  Now they can be played on a 3D printer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vw/nf/m3/vwnfm3f4icrrm5i4luhulb6-ezy.jpeg"><br><br>  Printing prototypes of plastic parts, in any case, is the main link of the whole process: from design to the final product.  It is necessary for the study and fine-tuning of every detail. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ul/jc/d7/uljcd7vffdxhqfrsdpuauyi0vew.jpeg"><br><br>  Now some details are already at the final stage of production. <br>  Sometimes I print products for my other hobbies - robotics and automation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/aj/p5/wh/ajp5whhyuc7m9feljrvppsp50y0.jpeg"><br><br>  This picture is another one of my current work.  This is an autonomous rover, equipped with an independent navigation system, a robotic bracket, a speech recognition system and a voice synthesizer. <br><br>  How such problems were solved before <br><br>  My previous printer did not provide accuracy in size, because  did not have good articulation and demanded from me a lot of mechanical modifications and alterations.  He also had limited print area and I had to print the parts in parts and then glue them together. <br><br>  Is it even worth mentioning that even without a 3D printer, access to such rapid prototyping and using 3D printing as a hobby would be impossible? <br><br><h3>  What did you like about working with Raise3D N1 Dual </h3><br>  The advantages of this printer are as follows: <br><br><ul><li>  Neat in size </li><li>  Print resolution </li><li>  Print quality </li><li>  The print chamber is completely closed and allows printing from materials that require a thermostatic print chamber, such as nylon. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ye/vu/g0/yevug06x0wjk-gkk6s-ysamjrxk.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  What can be improved </h3><br>  I replaced the print head coupling made of a piece of plastic corrugated tube with a conduit used in CNC machines.  It is not expensive, it cost me about one thousand rubles. <br><br>  I replaced the original nozzle with Olsson Ruby, with which I can print without problems with abrasive materials, such as filaments containing carbon and metal. <br><br>  I added a thermometer to control the temperature in the print chamber, it helps when printing from ABS, nylon and polycarbonate.  Replaced the power supply system with a Bondtech kit, and also added radiators to avoid overheating. <br><br>  The printer, which already printed very well, according to my subjective assessment, became even better after these changes.  Print quality has reached a score of 10 out of 10, while the original version was 7 out of 10. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1f/05/ls/1f05lsvm-1phgceofpcscfolta0.jpeg"><br><br>  I also plan to replace the motherboard cooling fan with a quieter one, and the driver for stepper motors with TMC2208. <br><br><h3>  About prospects </h3><br>  If we talk about the future, then I am sure that printing of metal parts on a 3D printer may become available at the level of a simple consumer. <br><br>  New plastics will also expand the functionality of printers, materials such as PEEK, polycarbonates or carbon fiber-reinforced nylon, which did not exist 5 years ago. <br><br>  Five-axis printers will allow to overcome the low structural resistance on the Z axis, that is, to increase the vertical strength. <br><br>  You can see my work on my page on <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/Gahwar">Thingiverse</a> . <br><br>  For several years in a row, due to the main work, I did not have enough time for new projects, but now the situation has improved.  I hope I‚Äôll finish my new engine and rover soon, so stay tuned. <br><br><h3>  Total </h3><br>  We thank Simone for such an interesting and detailed story, and we remind our readers that you can always <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/">buy a 3D printer</a> for work and a hobby at <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/">Top 3D Shop</a> .
