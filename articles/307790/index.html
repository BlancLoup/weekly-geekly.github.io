      <br>
      In my first post on the company's corporate blog, I would like to talk about cloud technologies as a service. <br><br>  Cloud technologies themselves are like an internal combustion engine - it is invented, it works, it is used everywhere, but how and where it is used: on cars or trucks - and how should it work?  That's what I would like to talk about, so this post will most likely be devoted to questions than detailed answers, and my thoughts on this matter. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/287/5dc/e32/2875dce3270740b1acc59a930c5bd7a0.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Service is our everything </h1><br>  <b><i>Lyrical digression about the dangers of lack of competition</i></b> <br><br>  <i>She lived-was Ukrposhta, she had a lot of customers, but she served them poorly: Hamila, lost parcels, delivered a long time and not at the right time.</i>  <i>And believed that her customers will be forever.</i>  <i>It would seem - the market is crammed and it is impossible to squeeze in there - there is no place and it will not work.</i>  <i>But then there were some upstarts, who called themselves New Mail, at the peak of the ‚Äúold‚Äù mail and started shipping for everyone: send parcels for all people, for enterprises large and small, transport goods large and small, pay attention to customer service and constantly work on quality.</i>  <i>And Ukrpochta was horrified!</i>  <i>- as so, we are monopolists!</i>  <i>and should always have stayed with them.</i>  <i>And Ukrpochta realized that any disregard for customers comes to an end.</i>  <i>And if you do not develop the market, the market will respond to you with growth, but without you, if you do not expand your service portfolio, do not raise the bar for yourself (and for your market), nothing will save you, even state status.</i> <br><br>  The story about Ukrpochta is another reminder that the lack of competition in the closed market is a dead end.  Nobody will move, make efforts to improve their services for customers, will not offer new services to customers if competitors do not breathe in his back. <br><br>  So, in the market of cloud solutions and technologies (I'm talking about our latitudes), the situation is about the same.  Most often, the client does not even realize that: a) such services can be provided at all, and there are already (not for us, but for example in Europe, or even there they are not), and b) there are companies that can provide these services. <br><br>  Often, providers try to give what they think customers need, while forgetting the customers themselves to ask about it.  Therefore, most often the client‚Äôs conversation with the domestic cloud provider is something like this: <br><br>  <i>Client: - I need a cloud</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Provider: - Here it is</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Client: - I need the same, but with mother of pearl buttons</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Provider: - dude, do you have to go or do you?</i>  <i>take what you have, there is still no other and never will be - no way!</i> <br><br>  Those data centers that already exist (in Ukraine), firstly - there are not so many of them, and secondly, if you imagine that, for example, 1,000 at once, for example, Ukrainian, even medium (and not only) companies will want to go to the clouds , all of these data centers will not have so much space and power, and thirdly, the cloud itself is nothing, it is just an engine without a car, it still needs its own infrastructure - they will not be able to provide critical additions to the clouds. <br><br>  Will all the requirements of cloud solutions customers be met?  Hardly.  Most likely, half of the customers will have to fence a hybrid structure in order to independently attach to the cloud what they still need - which is not good, since, again, overhead will increase.  And the second half will go to Western data centers for the reason that the level of services is much higher than our providers can provide. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/441/809/8e1/4418098e142e47a397739e23954e0a29.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Safety is our everything </h1><br>  In conditions of an unstable legislative situation, which, unfortunately, as bad karma weighs on many states, the same owner of almost any IT business can have fear all the time in their souls: will they not come?  and if they do not tear the server?  Nobody says that control bodies are not needed, they are needed, but often their education in IT is poor.  And even if there is something, there is at least a hint of something illegal, instead of acting neatly and precisely, they act with a cudgel: data is needed - what‚Äôs there, not just all the servers were taken out, but all the equipment that is in the office - and deal with the end - ‚Äúthe data are now exactly with us, comrade major!‚Äù.  And the fact that the company after such a medieval <s>‚Äúmask show‚Äù</s> mode of action of state representatives remains almost burned desert, interruption and paralysis of all business processes, losses (of which the state itself will receive less taxes), and image losses, and lots of other losses on all fronts, because the clients don't care who came to you and with what. <br><br>  In addition to the general legislative background in some countries, tradition is also important, the tradition of handling personal data, when it is considered that personal data is sacred, and no one has the right to violate the privacy of any companies, even if this company does not like, harass or annoy anyone. <br><br><h1>  Openness is our all </h1><br>  Often potential customers (our) data centers ask a million questions about who he is?  what he?  what do you do?  ‚ÄúWhose will he be‚Äù?  - i.e.  here, instead of simply providing high-quality cloud-infrastructure services to the client, the provider is insured and reinsured, thinking that ‚Äúbecause of this, the client will come to me or not?‚Äù so God forbid, because of this I didn‚Äôt have a problem with a client just because this client will simply interfere with the fact of his existence by some official or his relative. <br><br>  I am sure that openness to the provision of services is the basis of a healthy business, and if this is not a clear crime or something illegal, then why breed a bureaucracy?  if the client has a desire to work - what difference does he have, what is he doing and where did he come from? <br><br><h1>  Access speed is our everything </h1><br>  The main question asked when connecting a remote server - what is the speed of access?  Since inaccessible data is dead data.  Of course, no one talks about their cliffs (packagings), but here the same openness plays - it works for you, here my company tells the client - if you want, check it yourself.  Any client will be able to check the speed by downloading the file.  You can download a test file of 50Mb in size or a file of 1Gb in size for self-checking of the speed provided. <br><br><h1>  Software is our all </h1><br>  In 2000, Mercedes-Benz conducted an advertising campaign for its trucks, addressed to other road users: ‚ÄúSince we cannot send sausages by e-mail, we will have to divide the road.‚Äù  Everything that can be software - will be software, everything that can go to the ‚Äúclouds‚Äù - will go to the clouds.  According to forecasts, the public cloud market predicts growth to 28% per year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/397/7ac/348/3977ac3484884c878dcb59ab93433c58.jpg"><br><br>  Hybrid IT structures are already a transitional step towards this, but customers (especially in our latitudes) are still a little afraid to completely switch to remote IT services.  A hybrid cloud is also a yes-no cloud technology.  Such clients are still thinking about where it will be ‚Äúthere‚Äù in few places, it will be more reliable when it is in my closet.  This approach to the IT infrastructure, when it is not justified, is similar to storing ‚Äúmoney under a pillow,‚Äù of course, you need to keep some money on hand, but to keep everything, or most of it under the mattress, means falling behind the modern world and be inflexible in reaction to change.  But all these myths and fears will leave sooner or later, just as there was once a fear to pay for a purchase with a card on the Internet.  Everything is moving towards ‚Äúcloud-based software‚Äù. <br><br><h1>  Scalability, growth and startups are our everything </h1><br>  The client most often says: I don‚Äôt want to change my hardware every 3 years.  In this case, he should constantly have a headache about the need to increase the volume of disks, update the processors to the newest and most productive - all this requires large resources.  Not to mention that all the possibilities of clouds for startups are just a necessity, not a luxury. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/00f/d98/37e/00fd9837ef82488c8db6dc8fb80f2d8c.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to a large enterprise, private clients can also use cloud solutions for their needs.  In particular, start-up companies are often in conditions of limited resources - they do not have the opportunity to hire a team of IT specialists who would support the infrastructure necessary for the project, and the budget itself is limited to this infrastructure.  When everything starts, server hardware is often rented by a startup team to save money.  But they quickly run into the ceiling of opportunities, and the growth of pressure for them is often hardly predictable.  In the classic rental model, you need to constantly spend resources on the calculation and upgrade of hardware, and here is the time to turn to cloud technologies.  At the moment of rapid growth, you can fully appreciate the advantages of the cloud - this is, first of all, flexible scaling.  Even when it is impossible to predict the increase in load and buy ‚Äúin reserve‚Äù, you can always ‚Äúbuild up the muscles‚Äù of virtual systems as needed in a couple of clicks.  (SIN-Networks loves programmers and startups very much, we have very good conditions for them.) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f3e/178/da4/f3e178da4b134677970b07ca86b18215.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Cloud computing is our future </h1><br>  Here are some very interesting <a href="http://www.freecity.lv/bestseller/56/">notes from</a> an emigrant about what a person gets when he wants to open an online store in the UK: <br><br><blockquote>  <i>What is to create an online store, many people know.</i>  <i>In England, everything is a little different.</i>  <i>You do not need to create anything.</i>  <i>There is a mass of offers of ready-made blanks that only need to be rented.</i>  <i>All that you pay is the price of the hosting, and it depends on the number of product items.</i>  <i>The cheapest rental starts from 5 pounds a month, well, and then - how much fantasy is enough.</i>  <i>With a limit of 2000 positions and titles, the content of an online store costs ¬£ 9.59 per month.</i>  <i>All you had to do to create the store yourself was to fill in the ready-made forms with the names of the goods, his photos, provide all this with a description and set the price.</i>  <i>Shop is tied to the desired domain you, and full speed ahead!</i>  <i>Naturally, the software is easily coordinated with the accounting programs, the program of warehouse accounting, and has a parallel access to Ebay.</i> </blockquote><br>  For our latitudes - this is space.  But it is very good when there is something to strive for.  I want to say that cloud technologies (aka internal combustion engine) can be applied in a very wide range of needs, and you don‚Äôt have to think and limit yourself and your capabilities by the fact that ‚Äúthere is no other and never will‚Äù.  No, there is, maybe, and maybe with us, and we are working on it.  Moreover, there are forecasts that by 2020 the global market volume in the field of cloud technologies will reach $ 240 billion. <br><br>  Of course, not everything is so smooth, there are many legal issues with data storage, with the integration of clouds into the existing infrastructure, etc.  but in any case, no matter what difficulties IT professionals face when using cloud solutions, many agree that the future belongs to cloud technologies, and the advantages of cloud technologies far exceed the possible disadvantages. <br><br>  <i>The transfer of ERP-solutions from the local to the cloud allows medium-sized international companies to reduce costs by 30% and increase profits by 35%.</i>  <i>(AMI-PARTNERS BUSINESS BENCHMARKUNG WHITE PAPER, July 2014)</i> <br><br>  Returning to the example of mail and transportation, you can give an example of how ‚Äúsmall‚Äù IT changes have a global impact, an example from Ukraine: Ukraine has a lot of good and cheap traffic, so online trading has developed rapidly - stores have appeared like mushrooms after the rain ( good competition in prices), there was a huge logistics company that wants to open a branch in each village and has already succeeded in this, and now: an online store of any size can not create its own delivery service, and can sell and deliver through  w New address of the person in any (almost) anywhere in the country and give him exactly what he had bought.  As a result, now thanks to ‚Äúsome‚Äù IT technologies, the cash flow has also improved, the overhead costs (which fell on the shoulders of buyers) have decreased and now the distance is not an obstacle for purchases and good service.  It is safe to say that without the participation of cloud solutions, all this would not be possible. <br><br>  Answering the question in the title, I can say: in my opinion, cloud technologies are driving the IT industry, IT is driving civil society and improving people's lives.  Therefore, I believe that the future is in the clouds. <br><br><hr><br>  Also a few words about the social projects of my company <br><br><hr><br>  " <a href="https://www.sim-networks.com/">What does the company do</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="https://www.sim-networks.com/protected-cloud">What does SIM-Networks offer in cloud solutions?</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/307790/">https://habr.com/ru/post/307790/</a></p>
