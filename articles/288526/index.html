  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Blog Review # 5</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Worldwide instability, terrorists explode and burst, the weather presents unpleasant surprises in the form of typhoons and earthquakes, stocks on the stock exchanges depreciate ... And only one thing is stable - a review of blogs.  Oh, yes, even my cat under my own sofa shits steadily. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Ministry of Health warns, and I review.  Surprisingly, over the past week, as if by agreement, several bloggers decided to quit smoking.  Naturally, they comment on such an intimate process on their blogs.  Quite interesting to compare the results.  For example, the author of " <a href="http://superkino.ru/"><b>Filmblog</b></a> " decided to encode using the Stanford technique.  Here are his feelings after a day without cigarettes: ‚ÄúHe <i>starts to wedge his head, I think clearly worse, constantly chew anti-nicotine chewing gum. Chewing gum has never chewed before</i> . <a href="http://razuma.net.ru/"><b>Laboratories Strelka</b></a> "the author also decided to quit smoking, that's just without any newfangled stuff, but in a simple way - by will power.  On the fifth day the flight is normal: " <i>A very funny feeling: the body says: man, you need to stir up something ... something, damn it, I don‚Äôt even know something</i> ." <br><br>  Our star <a href="http://merkurov.ru/blog"><b>Merkurov is</b></a> not far behind our blogosphere colleagues.  He decided to quit smoking by reading Allen Carr's book, The Easy Way to Stop Smoking.  But, unfortunately, the fuse lasted for two days.  This is how the author describes his ordeals: ‚Äú <i>The process of throwing eventually began to be accompanied by scattered attention and thinking. If you consider that my main occupation is to think, but I could not think, the only way out was to dig up a bit and smoke.</i> ‚Äù the authors wrote in several posts, then I gave links directly to blogs in which it is easy to find these posts.  I hope this small retrospective will help someone from readers at least try to stop smoking.  I quit in the first grade, the technique was called ‚ÄúDad's Belt‚Äù. <br><br>  " <a href="http://ouch.kiev.ua/"><b>In detail</b></a> " tells about useful nonsense.  And the " <a href="http://ouch.kiev.ua/2005-12-06/357.html">useful nonsense</a> " is the Internet.  More precisely, not the Internet itself, but what is in it.  Almost revealed the meaning of life.

      Prior to this review, I did not publish links to articles in which I did not understand anything.  I will change this rule for the sake of the article " <a href="http://softwaremaniacs.org/blog/2005/12/01">property" float "in CSS</a> ", published in " <a href="http://softwaremaniacs.org/blog/"><b>Manic Weblog</b></a> ".  In principle, in html and in CSS, I understand a little bit (vertex), so I decided that such a large and detailed article (with pictures!) Would interest people involved in html coding. <br><br>  In a blog with the long title " <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/rentgen/"><b>Sunday bytes from inside Microsoft</b></a> ", the author notes that the topic of start-ups has recently come to life, and asks the question " <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/rentgen/archive/2005/12/01/498832.aspx">Casual gaming - is it possible to make money from it?</a> "  As a result, he comes to the conclusion that it is necessary to write simple games for women no older than 30 years.  Chain of reasoning and related links look in the article. <br><br>  Two of our forever <a href="http://slaff.net/"><b>Slaff</b></a> and <a href="http://setti.biz/"><b>Setti have</b></a> joined forces and have given the fruit of joint creativity - " <a href="http://slaff.net/2005/12/03/104">Activity in the blogosphere</a> ."  The main result (to which I join with all progressive humanity): " <i>Stop writing about IT!</i> " <br><br>  In the last review, <a href="http://evilbot.ru/"><b>EvilBot</b></a> was noted for comparing operating systems, and in this for comparing <a href="http://evilbot.ru/article/94">LJ and Blogs</a> .  It's funny that the article begins with a statement about the meaninglessness of such comparisons, and ends almost according to Putin: flies are separate, that is, LJ is separate, and blogs are separate. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.sellme.ru/"><b>Sell ‚Äã‚ÄãMe</b></a> took stock of the fall and very correctly laid out a list of <a href="http://www.sellme.ru/2005/12/02/sellmeru_-_luchshee_za_osen">his best articles</a> that appeared in his blog at this time of the year. <br><br>  A blog with a marvelous bourgeois name <a href="http://maulnet.net/"><b>Stop Me If You Think ...</b></a> pleases webmasters with a detailed note <a href="http://maulnet.net/%3Fp%3D76">about the robot.txt file</a> and its analogues. <br><br>  The author of the blog <a href="http://kolesnik.ru/"><b>kolesnik.ru</b></a> , apparently, got tired of being constantly asked: ‚ÄúHow to buy books or music in Amazon?‚Äù Therefore, he specifically wrote for the upcoming holidays an article-guide ‚Äú <a href="http://kolesnik.ru/2005/amazon">How to buy in Amazon</a> ‚Äù. <br><br>  <a href="http://kastorka.com/"><b>Castor</b></a> trying to understand <a href="http://kastorka.com/archives/2005/12/02/284">what women love and desire</a> ?  And he comes to the conclusion that it is those who love themselves, their bodies and are not afraid to be themselves.  In short, a typically feminine look at women's issues. <br><br>  In the " <a href="http://beta.delta-z.com/"><b>Den of the Engineer</b></a> " we are invited to touch the mysterious and incomprehensible world of photography.  And to its most fascinating part - <a href="http://beta.delta-z.com/index.php/archives/138">stereo</a> . <br><br>  Blog " <a href="http://usabilist.de/seeking/"><b>In search of usability</b></a> " meticulously and by the bone parses the new service <a href="http://usabilist.de/seeking/ru/google-base-in-details">Google Base</a> .  Quote: " <i>Google uses the motivation of authors who post their content" online "and want to find it, to further structure the Internet.</i> " <br><br>  " <a href="http://interbiz.ru/"><b>Internet business today</b></a> " talks about the correct strategy for e-mail marketing, in general, and, in particular, about such a variety as <a href="http://interbiz.ru/2005/12/05/43">Solus e-mail</a> . <br><br>  <a href="http://otebe.com/"><b>The blog</b></a> shares with us their feelings about <a href="http://otebe.com/moe/227">free love</a> or sex without commitment.  The author is worried that lovers of free sex may end up being disappointed in sex as such. <br><br>  Belarusians are completely lazy and stopped writing interesting notes in their blogs. <br><br>  Is that in <a href="http://inforedesign.com/"><b>inforedesign</b></a> Denis talks about gift services, more precisely, the so-called <a href="http://inforedesign.com/2005/11/30">wish-lists</a> . <br><br>  <a href="http://hvost.org/"><b>HvosT</b></a> shares with us <a href="http://hvost.org/%3Fp%3D140">tips and secrets</a> in the use of mobile phones.  There are many tips and they are the most diverse - from video conversion to the ability to send sms over the Internet. <br><br>  Despite the cold war of LJ against Blogs, I continue to maintain a neutral position and review everything.  Especially because in LJ for a week a lot of curious. <br><br>  Interesting, even sensational investigation " <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/bujhm/163920.html">The story of one song</a> ."  Everyone probably knows the famous song "Under the blue sky there is a golden city."  Can you tell who wrote it?  The most common answer is Grebenshchikov, but everything is much more complicated and interesting.  Really scientific work! <br><br>  Some of my readers send me letters with one single question: ‚ÄúWhat about gophers?‚Äù.  During the week I collected material and I hasten to share with you two (just!) Links.  First of all, everyone must know the " <a href="http://livejournal.com/community/susliki/6973.html">Ten Facts about Gophers</a> ".  For example, I did not know that "Gophers passed to Eurasia through Beringia from North America."  And secondly, you should definitely visit the " <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/_susel_/71892.html">Gallery of author bayans about gophers</a> ".  At this question about gophers consider closed! <br><br>  One of my favorite actors is Innokentiy Mikhailovich Smoktunovsky.  That is why it was doubly interesting for me to read the story that happened to him and his false jaw on the set of the picture " <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/starayavredina/2272.html">A trap for a lonely man</a> ."  And in general, a very interesting movie magazine, because the author worked for a long time at the Yalta Film Studio. <br><br>  And I also know the <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/lushin/43548.html">formula of sex</a> and, of course, I share it with you.  Say thanks to comrade lushin. <br><br>  As you know, LJ is famous for its communities, for example, the community of fans of the group ‚ÄúPlacebo‚Äù.  And only one question was asked there: " <a href="http://livejournal.com/community/ru_placebo/63985.html">Tell me, did Molko sleep with Bowie?</a> "  Let me explain: Brian Molko is the leader of the group, and David Bowie knows everything!  Read the comments, they are, as they say, harness. <br><br>  A fellow ‚Äúsnezhnikov‚Äù flipped through the book ‚ÄúAncient weapons and armor‚Äù and saw ‚Äú <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/snezhnikov/1864.html">Megarulosis</a> ‚Äù there.  Yes, a terrible and dangerous weapon, this megarulosis ... <br><br>  A sad story about the <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/vragsharapov/34611.html">impact of public toilets</a> on lesbian privacy.  There is nothing more to add. <br><br>  And the last link I will fulfill my civic duty to raise the culture of the sexual life of the population.  Here you can see a <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/vivisin/258882.html">visual agitation of the</a> correct use of sex toys and ... I won't say anything mysteriously. <br><br>  The blogging review is over on this.  Write letters and comments do not forget you.  Aggregators to use I urge you. <br>  <b>Alexey Khaletsky</b> <br>  <a href="http://crazyhamster.livejournal.com/160847.html">crazyhamster.livejournal.com/160847.html</a> <br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2005500602.htm">Published in "Computer News" (‚Ññ50, 2005)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288526/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288526/</a></p>
