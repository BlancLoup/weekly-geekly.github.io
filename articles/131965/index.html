As a result, I looked towards the projectors - and there is a bummer, my room is small and there is no place where this is a miracle story, put .  And then at work one of the clients ordered a pico projector, remembering about this miracle, walked through the reviews and what was available from us and took the Acer C20. <br><br>  <i>Let us turn now to those data, and puppy delight will continue further</i> <br>  <b>Dimensions:</b> (WxDxH) 118mm x 60.80mm x 18.60mm <br><br>  <b>Weight:</b> &lt;135g with battery (31g battery)

The following was pleasantly surprised by the fact that this huge number of various cables included.  However, there will be <b>no HDMI cable included</b> . <br>  Also, the manufacturer did not forget about the case of some leatherette. <br><br>  In general, on the way home, I of course dropped a couple of files and it was fun to display a picture of the whole house and scare people on the subway, but the main games were at home. <br>  Connecting to a laptop, I quickly installed it on a tripod, by the way it was not included either, and I watched a movie for half a night, then turned it off and got burned.  I did not expect that such a kid is capable of such.  In general, I was pleased with the picture quality.  The day has come and I took it with me.  Disappointment befell me immediately.  In daylight, the picture is not visible at all ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/8e633638/69aeb4fe/dfc3ad4a/dfb0984e.jpg"><br>  But I am not depressed, since I am friends with a soldering iron and I understand electronics very well. <br>  Having come to work first thing I disassembled it. <br>  In the inside, I really did not find anything interesting, only a small fee and a vast number of radiators.  Having closed the projector, I decided to google the names of the chips from the projector.  And the very first link got to the <a href="http://support.acer.com/acerpanam/Manuals/acer/2011/ServiceGuides/SG_C20_20100929_V1_0.pdf">service manual</a> for the animal.  My surprise was no chapel. <br>  In general, for those who swing laziness, in the <b>course of the service:</b> Menu - Menu - Menu-Left-Left-Menu <br>  <i><b>All the actions that you will do there you do at your own peril and risk, but I can say with confidence that by tweaking the settings I improved the picture quality but also reduced the life of the diodes in the same way, so be careful.</b></i> <br><br>  <b>To summarize:</b> <br>  For home use (watching movies in the evenings) is ideal for your money. <br>  We have it costs an average of 2300 UAH. <br><br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br>  Small size <br>  Omnivorous formats <br>  High quality pictures <br>  There is a battery <br>  A huge number of cables included <br><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br>  Very hot <br>  Inconvenient focus control <br>  Video needs to be converted <br>  Weak brightness in the afternoon <br>  No lens curtain <br>  No tripod <br>  Bad speaker <br><br>  <b>Video at work</b> (alas, not mine, no photo or video camera): <br>  Alas, it is not inserted here <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D_vZ1C78XEDo%26feature%3Drelated">IT</a> <br><br>  Ps.
