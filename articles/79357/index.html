      "Analogue" - meant by a purchase of high-quality music sound card and amplifier.  The output would get a pretty good sound quality (taking into account the quality of the pre-selected sound card and amplifier) ‚Äã‚Äãfor relatively little money. <br><br>  ‚ÄúDigital‚Äù - was limited to buying a receiver and, since it is possible to connect by ‚Äúdigital‚Äù, it did not require the purchase of a high-quality sound card, because all the work was shifted to the DAC of the receiver. <br><br>  As a result, after weighing all the pros and cons, he chose the second option, the underlying reason was a pleasant bonus in the form of the possibility of building a home theater, because at that time <a href="">Samsung LE37A656A1F</a> was already <a href="">available</a> . <br><br><h4>  Component selection </h4><br><br>  When it was finally decided what exactly the receiver would be, it was necessary to determine - coaxial or optics.  It was determined due to such a wonderful magazine as ‚ÄúStereo &amp; Video‚Äù, it was decided to use optics, in view of significant external interference. <br><br>  So.  After reading a lot of reviews on the resources of this subject, after listening to many different instances and spending a lot of time, as a result, they were bought: <br><br>  Receiver: <a href="http://www.pioneer.eu/ru/products/42/98/405/VSX-LX60/index.html">Pioneer VSX-LX60</a> <br>  Acoustics: <a href="http://www.mordauntshort.com/summary.php%3FPID%3D16%26Title%3DSummary">Mordaunt-Short Avant 908</a> <br>  Subwoofer: <a href="http://www.mordauntshort.com/summary.php%3FPID%3D19">Mordaunt-Short 909W</a> <br>  Cables: Real Cable CRYSTAL optics;  Subwoofer Real Cable-Innovation series (SUB1801 / 5M00) <br><br><h4>  Impressions </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b73/4c2/bd4/b734c2bd44e6cecc05c76aaf0ccea173.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <u><b>Pioneer VSX-LX60</b></u> <br><br>  Let me explain why he was chosen.  Firstly, I liked the review and the final rating from Stereo &amp; Video, and secondly, at the time of purchase of the receiver it was one of the most affordable models that could decode Dolby TrueHD and DTS HD (for me this is significant, I am interested in BD) thirdly, he bribed me with his design during his acquaintance in the store. <br><br>  For music (especially for my priority genres trance, trip-hop, etc.), strictly speaking, as well as for films - it fits just great and that says it all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c49/6e6/1a1/c496e61a182187805797bd2355fe781c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <u><b>Mordaunt-Short Avant 908</b></u> <br><br>  Despite its budgetary status (on average ~ 600 dollars), these napoliki sound very decent.  The sound is quite ‚Äúalive‚Äù, the bass is clean, fast and quite weighty (with backfill, without it is somewhat worse).  The averages are very good - clean and transparent, the high ones are not far behind them. <br><br>  Given the cost of the AU, I did not find any minuses in these fields.  The ‚Äúwarming up‚Äù of about two months was not a special minus for me. <br><br>  <u><b>Mordaunt-Short 909W</b></u> <br><br>  My choice fell on the older model from the Declaration series for a fairly simple reason - I heard it repeatedly in a friend‚Äôs case - it impressed me.  Naturally, he impressed me with his bass, but directly by the fact that the bass is very powerful, but at the same time quite clean.  In general, he was just a great pair for the Avant 908. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br><br>  Properly chosen and high-quality equipment is only the first step to your high-quality sound, but there are at least two more: <br><br>  - The first is, of course, files.  A lot will depend on the quality of your audio collection, again, I don‚Äôt impose my opinion on anyone here, but I‚Äôll still say that priority should be given to the lossless <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAC">FLAC</a> format. <br><br>  - the second is a player, here again I can only advise, and not impose an opinion.  In my humble opinion, the best for Windows are <a href="http://www.foobar2000.org/">foobar 2000</a> and <a href="http://www.aimp.ru/">AIMP 2</a> , but for Linux, the choice is unequivocal - <a href="http://amarok.kde.org/">Amarok</a> . <br><br>  In conclusion, when choosing the AU, the receiver and in general, everything that concerns the sound will be entrusted only to print reviews, Internet resources (even the most proven and authoritative), according to people you respect.  You have to go yourself and listen, and then you will understand - yours or not. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79357/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79357/</a></p>
