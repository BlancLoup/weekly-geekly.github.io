Therefore, I decided to show these answers in my personal blog, but for the ‚ÄúGames‚Äù, the reason may seem insignificant (although why else would this blog, if not for talking about games, but oh well), but whoever is interested will see it.  Interviews provide the latest screenshots so that the text does not seem dry. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/44e/36c/1cc/44e36c1cc037e03b93410056c4f1a2bc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Fighting People: Is it planned to further develop the series after the release of "Truckers 3"?  Are add-ons possible on other continents or in other countries?  Is there any chance that the ‚ÄúTruckers‚Äù will return to the spaces of the former USSR?

      Igor Belago: Development of the territorial add-on is already underway.  Russia seems to us to be one of the most attractive options for the next games in the series. <br><br>  Fighting People: Has the development of the promised Las Vegas add-on started, and when will the first information about it be published? <br><br>  Igor Belago: Yes, the development is already underway.  In more detail we will talk about it after the release of ‚ÄúTruckers 3‚Äù. <br><br>  Combat Folk: Is it planned to have a multiplayer game, and if so, what modes are planned?  I want to see something in the style of Test Drive Unlimited, i.e.  the opportunity to freely ride with friends throughout the territory, create your own clans / clubs, etc.  A series of truckers are very disposed towards this kind of MMO's instincts. &lt;Img <br><br>  Igor Belago: There will be no multiplayer in ‚ÄúTruckers 3‚Äù.  The possibility of introducing this mode in the continuations of the game is being investigated.  The genre itself, in our opinion, really very well falls on both multiplayer and MMO. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b92/fcd/6ff/b92fcd6ffb82363e8a739f9f122a8c82.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Fighting People: In San Diego, in real life, there is a subway line near the road.  Will we see subway trains in the game? <br><br>  Igor Belago: No, there are no metro trains in the game. <br><br>  Combat People: You say that traveling through the entire map from south to north will require 2-2.5 hours of real time.  Isn‚Äôt it like 18 Wheel of Steel?  There, too, huge distances, but to overcome them was incredibly boring.  Have you stepped on the same rake? <br><br>  Igor Belago: We hope not.  It will not be boring.  But judge you. <br><br>  Fighting People: In D2 there were 2 camera modes: from the cockpit and ‚Äúflight‚Äù.  On most videos, the ‚Äúflight‚Äù mode is present, but markedly different from the mode in D2.  If in D2 the movement of the camera vector behind the truck vector was smooth, then in D3 both vectors are rigidly attached ... Has this camera mode remained? <br><br>  Igor Belago: The mode has been preserved, but the possibility of setting the fixed positions of the external camera has been added to it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/607/650/461/607650461b09968835c5f8518ad24db2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Fighting People: I would like to know what happened to pedestrians <br><br>  Igor Belago: The initial implementation of pedestrians seemed to us unsatisfactory.  To create a new implementation, we simply did not have enough time.  We hope to introduce pedestrians in the addon. <br><br>  Fighting People: In the game, the coupling of the track with the semi-trailer takes place in video clips, and will there be an opportunity to hook / unhook the trailer independently with the key?  If not, then during a major accident, the s / trailer will be hooked to the truck saddle? <br><br>  Igor Belago: The ability to hook / unhook the trailer with a key, of course, exists.  In a serious accident, the hitch fails and uncoupling occurs.  Although in real life to break the hitch is very difficult. <br><br>  Combat People: In all the screenshots and in the video, the trailer engages at the base, by lowering the ‚Äúp / trailer‚Äù from the ceiling to the ground.  Why wasn‚Äôt it done in reality: does a truck stand with a semi-trailer at the ramp and the loader loads the load? <br><br>  Igor Belago: The loading of a trailer with goods is carried out ‚Äúbeyond the framework‚Äù of the game.  The player just hooks the already loaded trailer and takes him to his destination. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2db/275/5b3/2db2755b3f8ef6f3d5c78b9388b92aa4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Fighting People: In the first video interview with Denis Maltsev, the police arrested the main character on the territory of the trap stop when he moved!  And he was driving at a decent speed (24 mph ~ 40 km / h).  In connection with which such restrictions on the freedom of a gamer?  Or is this a ‚Äúbug‚Äù and in the release the police will arrest only at 0 mph? <br><br>  Igor Belago: In general, the arrest of the game occurs at sufficiently low speeds.  If the player has significantly reduced the speed, it is considered that either he decided to submit to the demands of the police, or the police forced him to stop. <br><br>  Combat People: How different phrases will be used in radio communications, or will it be some standard questions and answers?  Will there be more traffic signs besides defining the speed limit? <br><br>  Igor Belago: The game has most of the signs present on real California roads.  Although not all of those that exist in reality.  As for the negotiations, they are quite diverse and most often unique to each interlocutor. <br><br>  Fighting People: Is it possible the appearance of an animal on the highway? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/263/b11/6cc/263b116ccacd8d1f4a0de8c9648cf475.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Igor Belago: No.  California highways are carefully netted to avoid such incidents. <br><br>  Fighting People: Why did the secretary Pamela change their clothes (in the screenshots from the developer diaries, she is wearing different clothes)? <br><br>  Igor Belago: A lot has changed in the game since 2004, including characters.  Clothes changed because the new liked more. <br><br>  Combat People: Can you hang the ‚Äúclutch pedal‚Äù function on any button of the controller (steering wheel), which doesn't have a clutch pedal (for example in LogitechMOMO)? <br><br>  Igor Belago: The clutch pedal is a reassignable control, so you can redefine it. <br><br>  Fighting People: Will competitors ‚Äúpump over‚Äù their trucks in D3, or, like in D2, will a ‚Äúpumped-in‚Äù car be a privilege exclusively for the player and the drivers working for his company? " <br><br>  Igor Belago: Yes, pumping competitors occurs.  As they move, they become stronger, and their cars are more powerful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/29a/cbf/b62/29acbfb62b0c4cc13d9f4173f30eb7eb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Fighting People: Will there be a front bumper with protection (upgraded grille, like a jeep or a monster truck) among the upgrades? <br><br>  Igor Belago: Yes, such an upgrade is available for a part of the machines. <br><br>  Fighting Folk: Can we continue to play after the story ends, or will we need to start from the beginning?  And will there be some fixed time for the passage, after which the company will end in defeat (those same 80 hours)? <br><br>  Igor Belago: Yes.  After the story victory, you can continue the game.  Competing companies are increasing their presence in the region and, if the player is not successful, then after a certain time the market will be captured by a competitor.  This is an economic defeat in the game. <br><br>  Combat Folk: How will saving be realized?  Will it be possible to click ‚ÄúSave‚Äù at any time, and also boot, or only in the NickTrucking garage / office? <br><br>  Igor Belago: You can save and load at almost any time when the player can control the machine.  Hot keys for saving and loading will also be available. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b02/fa8/09b/b02fa809b11db5980ea24522f2aa6908.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Fighting People: Has the band Aria remained the author of the tracks? <br><br>  Igor Belago: No, the music in the game imitates California car radio and was written by American composers. <br><br>  Combat Folk: Have you left the idea with a fatal outcome in the game? <br><br>  Igor Belago: Yes, the main character may die, and both at the hands of villains, and as a result of a car accident. <br><br>  Fighting People: Is it possible to load the trailer not completely, but partially?  Is it possible to load one semi-trailer with different loads, if its type allows it?  Will the load level of the semitrailer affect the behavior of the train? <br><br>  Igor Belago: No, the trailer is always loaded with one type of cargo.  Loading is always maximum either according to the carrying capacity of the machine, or according to the net volume of the trailer.  Weight of the load naturally affects the behavior of the composition. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/664/68e/b2c/66468eb2ce84433e3bacaa3c1e145c3d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Fighting People: How many trucks will be represented in the game?  Will they be subdivided into any species? <br><br>  Igor Belago: Only long-haul tractors are available for controlling the game.  A total of 14 different models are available.  (More about trucks in our publication Truckers 3: How to conquer America) <br><br>  Combat People: Will there be illegal cargoes in the game? <br><br>  Igor Belago: Illegal cargoes will be.  Sometimes the player can offer an easy job, as they say, ‚Äúout of friendship.‚Äù  It is possible that such an order would be associated with something illegal. <br><br>  Fighting People: Can a load fall, i.e.  fall off the trailer?  Or is it tightly attached in any case? <br><br>  Igor Belago: No, the load from the trailer does not fall out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/824/c4a/e38/824c4ae387dff9173791a1f8c8880b75.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Fighting People: Many characters are used in the game.  Are they all fictional, that is, are they a figment of imagination of the developers, or were the actors involved?  Maybe all the characters are SoftLab-NSK employees? <br><br>  Igor Belago: All the characters in the game are fictional. <br><br>  Fighting People: Is it possible to blind cars traveling towards me with the included high beam at night?  What will be the behavior of the "blinded"?  Will they stop blinking lights? <br><br>  Igor Belago: No, this behavior is not provided. <br><br>  Fighting People: When it rains, only the sight glass is flooded with rain, and the side windows are dry. So it will remain, or will this defect be eliminated? <br><br>  Igor Belago: all the windows in the car get wet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ddf/c9c/035/ddfc9c035ed67199617098b8b6a878fa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Fighting People: Is it possible to skip cut scenes? <br><br>  Igor Belago: As a rule, yes, except for those scenes that are important for understanding what is happening. <br><br>  Fighting People: Will the traffic still have dark glass? <br><br>  Igor Belago: Some cars have a dull toning, some have lightweight, and some have almost no tinted glass. <br><br>  Fighting People: In case of accidents at traffic machines, as before, everything will open?  Are traffic windows broken? <br><br>  Igor Belago: It depends on the specific model.  Some fight, some do not.  With the opening of the door - the same. <br><br>  Combat People: Is it possible to pierce a radiator in a collision, as a result of which a liquid will flow out that will be visible on asphalt or any other surface, the engine will overheat and wear will occur faster? <br><br>  Igor Belago: Yes, something like this will all happen, except, perhaps, puddles on the road. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5a8/047/ab7/5a8047ab7e1ef4d68656149cebd59bb7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Fighting People: Will there be dirt and gravel roads in the game, besides good smooth asphalt? <br><br>  Igor Belago: California's highways are mainly represented by two types of pavement - asphalt and streamed concrete.  Gravel, soil and dust only on the sides. <br><br>  Fighting People: The D2 had a wonderful system for adjusting the sensitivity / feedback of the steering wheel when playing the keyboard.  Will she stay in D3? <br><br>  Igor Belago: Yes, this system has remained. <br><br>  Combat People: Will there be 2 driving modes - smooth (‚Äúurban‚Äù) and sharp (with the ctrl key pressed)?  If yes, then will the ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù mode really be like that ‚Äî that is, starting with ‚Äúpre-closing‚Äù, smooth gear changes, etc. <br><br>  Igor Belago: Yes.  The Ctrl key has the same meaning as in previous games in the series. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f70/d6a/beb/f70d6abeb0d168481f38668fdb78cc71.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Fighting People: Will the mirrors in the truck play a full role, and will they display the real image? <br><br>  Igor Belago: Yes, the image in the mirrors is a real reflection.  The position of the mirrors can be adjusted. <br><br>  Fighting People: From what engine brands was the sound for the game recorded? <br><br>  Igor Belago: The sounds of real American engines were used for long-haul trucks. <br><br>  Fighting People: In D2 was a very competent and intuitive help.  What will happen this time? <br><br>  Igor Belago: ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù is mainly inherited.  In addition, for complex menus introduced the possibility of issuing detailed text instructions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/661/925/acd/661925acd364f67cb31f50397115de59.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Fighting Folk: One of the articles mentioned that it will be possible to change the game soundtrack for your own MP3 tracks.  Does this mean that you can create multiple user radios (using playlists or different folders)?  And is streaming audio (internet radio) supported?  If not, is it possible to add this feature in the future? <br><br>  Igor Belago: Yes, this possibility was introduced into the game.  Streaming audio is not supported.  Perhaps in the future we will be able to add this opportunity. <br><br>  Fighting People: What is the development policy of the series: add-ons, continue? <br><br>  Igor Belago: The nearest plan is an addon.  In the future - time will tell. <br><br>  Fighting People: What was your opinion, Igor, the most difficult to develop a game? <br><br>  Igor Belago: Its scope. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72968/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72968/</a></p>
