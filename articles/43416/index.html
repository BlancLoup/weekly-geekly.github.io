And to begin work in the presence of a certain circle of competitors is much more interesting.  Leaders do not frighten us, we treat them with respect, but we will try to be as good as possible. <br><br>  <b>What is the project budget?</b>  <b>How big is he?</b> <br>  We cannot name the budget in banknotes, but not because the figure is secret, but because it can only be assessed in the number of sleepless nights and nerves lost in difficult discussions.  And if so, then, as they say - priceless. <a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>Who invested (if there are investors, of course) in the project funds?</b> <br>  There are three investors today. <br><br>  <b>What is the money spent on?</b> <br>  Until recently, only for development, since the official opening, funds were added to the project budget for promotion, for project advertising.  Most of the budget, of course, will go into the development of project services, in its continuous improvement. <br><br>  <b>What do you see the uniqueness of bookmix.ru?</b> <br>  Of course, the idea itself cannot be called unique.  But each project, albeit with a similar idea, has its own unique features, ranging from design, user interface, to a set of services and functionality.  In our case, we add that we will try to go in the same direction with our participants, listen to their advice, discuss ideas and try to implement them as quickly as possible.  This will help to be in constant contact with the users of the project, while constantly improving it. <br><br>  <b>Who is this project for?</b>  <b>Who is your audience?</b> <br>  The project was created primarily for those who read.  And we hope that such people are still very, very much.  And not just fiction, but any. <br><br>  <b>Are there any analogues in the project?</b> <br>  Of course, you did not just ask the first question about whether we are not afraid of among competitors.  But, do not make us, please call them names. <br><br>  <b>Is a big team working on a project?</b> <br>  No, at the moment five people are constantly working, as the project develops, the state will grow, of course, there are all the prerequisites for this. <br><br>  <b>Where is your office located?</b> <br>  We consider it logical that the Bookmix.ru project office is located in the cultural capital of Russia, the glorious city of St. Petersburg. <br><br>  <b>How do you see the future of the project?</b> <br>  If they had not seen a bright future, they would not have begun it.  But seriously, we hope that the project will appeal to our users and the audience will constantly grow. <br><br>  <b>How will you develop bookmix.ru?</b>  <b>In the direction?</b> <br>  In the direction in which our participants will lead it, as we have said, the opinions and advice of our users are important to us for qualitative development and we will try to follow this concept. <br><br>  <b>What do you think the new project will bring and what effect will it have on the Runet?</b> <br>  We hope that in a difficult competition we will be able to position the project at its best and will try to involve as many as possible those who are gradually starting to disappear from our planet, namely true connoisseurs and book lovers.  Maybe we can have a positive impact on those who consider reading to be boring.  Thus, we will improve the quality of education, life, triple the GDP and lead everyone into a bright future. <br><br>  <b>How are you going to make money on the project to return the investment?</b> <br>  We will try.  But in what form the advertisement on the portal will be presented, it‚Äôs too early to say, many pros and cons need to be weighed.  It is important that the advertising information carries real benefits for the participants. <br><br>  <em>This interview was <a href="http://5pages.net/2008/10/17/bookmixru-esli-by-ne-videli-svetlogo-budushhego-ne-stali-by-i-nachinat/">published</a> on my blog almost two weeks ago.</em>  <em>Meanwhile, already seven weeks, as Bookmix.ru is in a big voyage, during this time something should have happened.</em>  <em>And it happened: after a fairly short time after opening, the portal was attempted to be hacked, several times the service was unavailable, the guys changed hosting ... Actually, this is not so bad, everyone has problems.</em>  <em>During this short period that Bookmix works, quite a lot of new and useful things have been done for users, which the team briefly described in our correspondence.</em> <br><br>  <b>Anything new?</b> <br>  The number of participants is growing daily, which means that the number of ratings and opinions about books read by our participants is growing.  Based on the collected data, we opened a new section " <a href="http://bookmix.ru/bestbooks.phtml">Recommended literature</a> ", where you can get acquainted with the most popular and highly rated books.  This is the first step in the recommendatory component of the site. <br><br>  For the further development of the functional, we ask participants not to forget to evaluate the books that are in the lists of read literature and the list of references that we would like to read. <br><br>  In order to make it convenient to evaluate the books that are in the personal library, we have introduced a functionality that allows you to evaluate books directly in the lists without reloading the page. <br><br>  For the convenience of new users, we added the ability to quickly populate the personal library lists using a downloadable text file with the listed ISBN numbers, and for users who have an account on Livelib.ru, we added the ability to import lists of read and desired reading materials to our site.  Import of lists of books can be carried out in <a href="http://bookmix.ru/users/importbooklist.phtml">a user profile</a> . <br><br>  From pleasant and useful trifles: <br><ul><li>  identical books are combined on the same page of the book where they are added <br>  tab "Other publications" ( <a href="http://bookmix.ru/book.phtml%3Fid%3D32036">for example</a> ); </li><li>  added the ability to edit reviews and news within 30 minutes after adding; </li><li>  added <a href="">RSS feed</a> ; </li><li>  the <a href="http://bookmix.ru/users/updates.phtml">Update</a> service has been modified, where you can now see more information regarding your friends and literature that interests you; </li><li>  in the message section when replying to a message, you can now see the entire history of correspondence; </li><li>  updated the " <a href="http://bookmix.ru/groups/">Groups</a> " section for easier navigation through the section and work of the communities; </li></ul>  and other nice innovations that made working with the project more convenient. <br><br>  <b>What would you like to wish your participants, present and future?</b> <br>  We wish you a pleasant and productive work with BookMix.ru, waiting for good reviews, discussions, ratings, and, of course, suggestions for the further development of the project!  Thank! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/43416/">https://habr.com/ru/post/43416/</a></p>
