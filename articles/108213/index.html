It all started with the purchase of a communicator on the Android platform. <br><br><h4>  Prehistory </h4><br>  Before changing my phone, I had an old, unkillable Sharp-clamshell and, as it were, there were no problems.  After buying a new one, I realized that I often didn‚Äôt have enough time to: hear the phone -&gt; get it out of my bag (or from under my clothes on my belt) -&gt; get it out of my case and answer the call.  I tried to call myself from the city, and it turned out that after 30 seconds of waiting, the answering machine, which I did not order and which I would not need, would turn on. <br><br><h4>  Is required </h4><br>  What is needed (and it used to be): <br>  1) SMS notifications if the phone was turned off during a call; <br>  2) an incoming call with no time limit until the connection is made (now the limit is 30s); <br>  3) no answering machines. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Call center </h4><br>  Began to understand.  First, using the site uslugi.beeline.ru tried to disable the unnecessary service to me.  It turned out that the service is called ‚Äúbe aware‚Äù (which I did not include) and cannot be disabled on the site, although other services can be turned on / off.  From that moment I started calling the call-center on 0611 in order to solve my problem.  I made about five calls and during this time I managed to do the following: <br>  1) listen and say that I am fine; <br>  2) turn off the ‚Äúbe aware‚Äù service for me, as a result, SMS did not come when the phone was turned off during a call; <br>  3) to turn the service back on, but without the answering machine, everything seemed to be fine, but the call began to end again in 30 seconds.

    <h4>  Technical details </h4><br>  I decided to go into details.  It turned out ... <br>  1. Connecting the service ‚Äúbe in the know with an answering machine‚Äù prescribes (tightly, cannot be deleted) in the phone‚Äôs call forwarding settings the number +79037030428.  He prescribed in the fields "in the absence of an answer" and "when it is impossible to connect."  And why do I need an answering machine in the absence of an answer? <br>  2. Activation of the service ‚Äúbe aware without an answering machine‚Äù prescribes the number +79037430045 (also tightly) in the same fields: ‚Äúwhen there is no answer‚Äù and ‚Äúwhen connection is impossible‚Äù. <br>  3. If you do not include these services, you can manually call forwarding phones, but (!) This +79037430045 does not work (SMS does not come), and this +79037030428 (answering machine) works as an answering machine, but SMS notification is also not are coming. <br><br><h4>  I require a conversation with a specialist </h4><br>  I didn‚Äôt stop at that, I rang again and got the conversation not from the Call-center, but from those.  special  He didn‚Äôt give me an answer right away, but when he called back after a while, he said that the service ‚ÄúBe aware‚Äù works this way and he cannot do anything. <br><br><h4>  MTS and others </h4><br>  I decided to check, and how things are with other operators, and there was a person with two MTS-sims, corporate and personal, at hand, or rather in the working neighborhood.  And I was surprised to find on both, that when the same service was turned on, the phone is registered in the redirection only in one field: ‚Äúwhen connection is impossible‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  Attempt number two </h4><br>  Of course, I decided to try again and wrote a request feedback form on the Beeline website.  Message text: <br> <code>--------</code> <br>  Please immediately send this message to specialists.  This question is not related to the management of services, it is related to how one of these services works, so the call center will not help me. <br>  Hello. <br>  When using Beeline‚Äôs mobile communications, I ran into a problem that I couldn‚Äôt solve and I can‚Äôt solve telephone support.  The problem is that I cannot turn on the ‚Äúbe in the know‚Äù service, but at the same time disable ‚Äúcall forwarding if not answered‚Äù, because  ‚ÄúBe in the know‚Äù service tightly records redirection in phone settings and cannot be turned off.  The fact is that if call forwarding is enabled, the incoming call cannot last longer than 30 seconds, but 30 seconds is not always enough to answer.  A few years ago, this was not, and the redirection could be turned on and off freely.  I checked the same service with the operator MTS - everything is in order, redirection is set only by "unavailability".  I hope that this problem can be solved, and because of such trifles it is not necessary to change the operator. <br>  Respectfully, <br>  Stanislav <br> <code>--------</code> <br>  I waited for an answer for several days and today a specialist called me and said that this setting was introduced about three months ago.  To my argument that other operators are fine with this, he replied that "now this service will have only this behavior and will not be changed." <br><br><h4>  Continuing the story from the comments in my blog </h4><br><br>  Soundman77 comments ... <br>  Good day!  I work at Beeline.  Ready to assist in solving this issue.  But for this I need to know your phone number (the phone number can be sent to my address Pomogite@beeline.ru) <br><br>  kamd comments on ... <br>  If you want to receive SMS about who called you, without the possibility of leaving messages to callers, then use the service Be aware (do not be aware +) <br>  However, ‚ÄúBe aware‚Äù has a feature and works so that if you do not pick up the phone for 30 seconds ... then the caller will hear the answering machine ‚ÄúThe subscriber does not answer or is temporarily unavailable‚Äù, you will see an unanswered call on the screen and you will know who called  Management of redirects in this case is not provided ... <br>  But one way or another, marketers of the company will take into account your response.  And in accordance with it will work out the changes ..)) <br><br>  GiNeR comments on ... <br>  These 30 seconds are the problem that other operators do not have. <br>  October 6, 2010 7:40 pm <br><br>  GiNeR comments on ... <br>  They called me about 20 minutes ago from VimpelCom (in response to the letter at Pomogite@beeline.ru).  They introduced themselves as CEO (it seems without a name, in any case I did not remember the name).  They say that the new equipment works this way and cannot be configured differently.  It sounds a bit strange, especially considering what used to work wrong.  According to the caller, information about the problem has been received and an assessment will be made of the possibility and cost (for the company) of its solution.  They offered money compensation (apparently decided that I was worried about money for chimes, and not about inconvenience, although this is not so). <br>  In general, I take a timeout of two months, and if nothing changes, I will change the operator, but for the time being I will be looking at the tariffs. <br>  In addition, I looked at TELE2 tariffs in various regions (which is not yet in Moscow).  What I like about him is that there are no stars, all tariffs are transparent.  So much is a minute of conversation, so much SMS and it does not matter even if a bit more expensive, but honestly.  Once the tag was Megaphone when it just appeared. <br><br><h4>  Operator change </h4><br>  Now I have the ‚ÄúFirst Child‚Äù tariff.  More than a month has passed since the beginning of this story, but no changes are foreseen.  The number is a pity, but, apparently, you still have to change the operator. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108213/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108213/</a></p>
