How we violated the speed of the mobile Internet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Monday, early morning, autodrome near Moscow.  Chef Instructor of the Academy of Safe Driving, a popular IT blogger and experts in the field of telecommunications MegaFon gathered around the sports car. <br><br>  What made this motley company come together?  And made them the first in a series of "destruction of the myths" of cellular communication experiment.  As part of these experiments, the quality of the mobile Internet will be tested in unusual and often extreme situations: during peak loads on equipment. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/megafon/blog/310096/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/218/99b/319/21899b319a10b923c5727967db6b7087.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As you know, MegaFon PJSC was the first company to provide Russian subscribers with high-speed mobile Internet connection (both 3G and 4G), and at the moment, with his direct participation, work is underway to switch to 5G. <br>  The quality of the mobile Internet depends on many factors.  Among them:

    <ol><li>  the distance from the base station (BS) and its load (do not forget that voice traffic takes precedence over data transmission); <br></li><li>  the presence of obstacles between the BS and the subscriber; <br></li><li>  the work of programs that filter traffic, with the possibility of limiting the channel (firewalls, antiviruses, etc.); <br></li><li>  the hardware platform of the smartphone (often the internal limitations of the chips do not allow using 4G at full capacity); <br></li><li>  in a car, the quality of communication is also affected by toning - the metallized film screens the waves. <br></li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8d4/cd3/96c/8d4cd396c6eec33419712befe19ef98d.jpg"><br><br>  According to the specification, 4G Internet should work when driving at speeds up to 300 km / h.  But in fact, no one experienced it at such a speed: high-speed trains are still new to us, and it is fraught to drive on public roads at such a speed.  ‚ÄúDidn't you feel it?‚Äù MegaFon‚Äôs experts got excited.  - "So let's try it!".  Approximately the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis and subsequent experiments was born. <br>  So, the heroes of today's "speeding up the mobile Internet". <br><br>  1. MegaFon engineers who wish to remain anonymous <br><br>  By and large, on their shoulders lies only the "artistic" leadership and the overall organization of the process.  No preparatory operations with the base station or other equipment were carried out, and even the engineers themselves did not fully know how it would all end. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/37b/1f3/577/37b1f3577354ead907366b9d33a11afa.jpg"><br><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Megafon engineers (they wished to remain anonymous, since they are on a mission) did not know the end of the experiment - no preparation of base stations was carried out.</font></i> <br><br>  2. Valentine <i>Wylsacom</i> Petukhov and Alexey Karachev <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d99/1f7/e2e/d991f7e2e79417e08d7aa9f8a0b0bb4b.jpg"><br><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Behind the wheel of a Mercedes-Benz AMG GT car will be Russian athlete-racing driver Alexey Karachev.</font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6c3/e4f/0de/6c3e4f0decc62b9bce7a68c162630281.jpg"><br><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Internet blogger Wylsacom will be measuring Internet speed at fabulous speeds.</font></i> <br><br>  The essence of the experiment was as follows: a mobile test bench in the form of an iPhone 6s, a MacBook connected to it and Wylsacom on board passes at maximum speed (something about 250 km / h) along the test track, and the Internet speed is measured at several points Speedtest service), control file download and streaming video from MegaFon.tv service. <br><br>  The circuit is not chosen by chance - it is one of the few places where you can develop such speeds, and also because the nearest base station of MegaFon, although located outside the city, is designed for a large crowd of people.  Thus, the test conditions are roughly similar to the average city. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eb8/218/6a8/eb82186a8d7aeb3ce806ad3c571e2792.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/257/048/603/2570486039e8adebd1b3d0627796f880.jpg"><br><br>  <i><font color="#999999">The track of the autodrome with a length of about 4 km has 15 turns, and the maximum design speed for Formula 1 cars is 311 km / h.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Our car will drive only 60 km / h slower.</font></i> <br><br>  The key to the start, the engine stuns all those present and the 462-strong Mercedes-Benz AMG-GT sports car slowly goes to the first lap.  Why slow?  Because you first need to warm up the tires and evaluate the track. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d62/870/26e/d6287026e5548c2f2a7ef35094510b87.jpg"><br><br>  <i><font color="#999999">The driving force of the experiment provides a 462-strong sports car Mercedes-Benz AMG-GT.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Very beautiful sports car!</font></i> <br><br>  What happened next is difficult to describe with the words: under the squeal of tires and the roar of the engine, the car cut circles around the track.  The spectacle is extremely impressive!  A couple of laps passed in the trunk and the operator (video <a href="https://youtu.be/0aGrQ_VOPN4">posted</a> Wylsacom), since then he has not spoken to us at all, but only smiled. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/89a/55f/fb1/89a55ffb109134f660d5c9f076c42c8b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c88/9e1/a1d/c889e1a1d4564568ec87b7c2ec096ae5.jpg"><br><br>  <i><font color="#999999">The mobile test bench was an iPhone 6s with a Macbook Pro connected via USB.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">When cornering, the equipment had to be firmly held in the hands so that nothing would fly away - in a corner the flying laptop can be dangerous.</font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a7e/c6b/a5b/a7ec6ba5bd5593f5201b42a2aeb7b716.jpg"><br><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Test Mercedes-Benz dials the "first hundred" in just 4 seconds.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">It's very fast.</font></i> <br><br>  According to a total of 4 laps (this is about 16 km or 7 minutes 20 seconds at a speed of 250 km / h), we have the following results: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/218/99b/319/21899b319a10b923c5727967db6b7087.jpg"><br><br>  In fairness, we note that throughout the track, the quality of the Internet was not the same, but everywhere on the highway, the mobile Internet worked stably and with more than enough speed.  The best performance pilots received on a long straight section, where the stands are located. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fdb/442/866/fdb44286636a0c29fe2fe664f99e1507.jpg"><br><br>  <i><font color="#999999">According to the results of measurements, the mobile Internet of Megaphone showed speed from 56 Mbit / s on the speed line to 75 Mbit / s in peak.</font></i> <br><br>  A test file with a capacity of <b>100</b> MB was uploaded to Yandex.Disk in advance; the download time was <b>no more than 20</b> seconds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a53/fcd/45d/a53fcd45dd7666992d3cae94036ff569.jpg"><br><br>  MegaFon.tv and the next season of ‚ÄúGame of Thrones HD‚Äù was used as a source of streaming video.  The series was shown without jerks, and scrolling was without delay. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/330/70e/308/33070e30850ba3a37a629243ec9f2a0b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5f2/369/7d1/5f23697d1c05da3bf48495ff1842a291.jpg"><br><br>  <i><font color="#999999">View the next series of "Game of Thrones" at a speed of 250 km / h?</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">No problem if you have MegaFon Internet!</font></i> <br><br>  Summarizing, we can say with confidence that the dependence of the quality of mobile Internet 4G on Megaphone on speed has not been established.  At least, as long as you are moving no faster than 250 km / h. <br><br>  <b>Video:</b> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0aGrQ_VOPN4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In the next issues, we will look at the influence of other factors on the mobile Internet and destroy a couple more myths.  Do not switch and observe the speed limit! <br><br>  <i>Report from the test conducted a professional photographer Alex Zaitsev</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/310096/">https://habr.com/ru/post/310096/</a></p>
