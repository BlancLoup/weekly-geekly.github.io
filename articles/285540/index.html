  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dunning-Kruger effect</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Having opened Habr today in the morning, I found an article in the Human Resources hub, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/172499/">‚ÄúDo you have a lot of money?</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/172499/">Then we go to you!"</a> <br>  In my work, I often had to deal with the situation described there, and I am sure that the majority of readers are familiar with the situation. <br>  However, just the other day, wandering around Wikipedia, I found the answer to the question ‚ÄúWhat kind of phukinglyphuk comes with this world?‚Äù, Which had tormented me for many years.  I want to share my find here: <br><br>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D1%2584%25D1%2584%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582_%25D0%2594%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0_%25E2%2580%2594_%25D0%259A%25D1%2580%25D1%258E%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0">The effect of Dunning - Kruger</a> - cognitive distortion, which lies in the fact that people with a low level of qualification, make erroneous conclusions, make bad decisions and at the same time are <b>unable to realize their mistakes due to the low level of their qualifications</b> (emphasis mine, track).  This leads to an overestimation of their own abilities, while really highly qualified people, on the contrary, tend to underestimate their abilities and suffer from a lack of self-confidence, considering others to be more competent.  <b>Thus, less competent people in general have a higher opinion of their own abilities than is typical of competent people, who also tend to assume that others rate their abilities as low as they themselves.</b>  (selection is mine again, track) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The hypothesis of the existence of a similar phenomenon was put forward in 1999 by Justin Kruger and David Dunning, who also referred to Charles Darwin‚Äôs remarks (‚ÄúIgnorance often creates confidence rather than knowledge‚Äù) [Charles Darwin The Descent of Man (w) Introduction, page 4 (1871).] And Bertrand Russell (‚ÄúOne of the unpleasant properties of our time is that those who are confident are stupid, and those who have at least some imagination and understanding are filled with doubt and indecision‚Äù). <br><br>  To test the hypothesis put forward, Kruger and Dunning conducted a series of experiments with students participating in psychology courses at Cornell University.  At the same time, they proceeded from the results of studies of their predecessors, which demonstrated that incompetence largely stems from ignorance of the basics of a particular activity, be it reading comprehension, driving, playing chess, playing tennis, etc. <br>  They hypothesized that the following are typical for people with low qualifications in any type of activity: <br><ul><li>  They tend to overestimate their own skills; </li><li>  They are not able to adequately assess the really high level of skills in others; </li><li>  They are not able to realize the full depth of their incompetence; </li></ul><br>  After training, they have the ability to realize the level of their former incompetence, even if their true competence after training practically does not change.

      The results of the experiments, which confirmed the hypothesis put forward, were published in English.  <a href="http://www.apa.org/journals/features/psp7761121.pdf">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology in December 1999</a> (the link is the original text of the 1999 study). <br>  For this study, by the way, the authors of the article were even awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in Psychology in 2000 (By itself, this fact does not diminish the scientific value, by the way. The so-called Ig Nobel Prize is humorous, but not satirical, fact its delivery, contrary to popular belief, does not in the least question the scientific value of the awards to be awarded, since, by definition, it is awarded "for achievements that make you laugh first, and then think about it" (first make people laugh, and then make think) That  st is not a "Razzie", I would like to clarify this fact alone. The prize is awarded for an unusual and ingenious research that could attract attention and spur people's interest in science, medicine and technology. <br><br>  The results of other similar studies, including the development of the initial work, were presented in 2003 and 2008.  Thus, we can assume that the Dunning-Kruger effect is a truly existing psychological cognitive phenomenon. <br>  The people who come to the interviews, who do not possess the elementary skills of the chosen profession, BolgenOS and Antivirus Babushkina, all this‚Ä¶ shame created in ‚Äúabout science‚Äù programs on Russian television, apparently, all this is a visually visible manifestation of the Dunning-Krueger effect, around us everyday. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285540/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285540/</a></p>
