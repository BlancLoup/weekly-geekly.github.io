Preparing for the delivery of the second group of electrical safety</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><a name="Go0"></a><br>  Good day to all.  In the course of the work path, valiant engineers are required to take exams in electrical safety, obtaining, confirming or increasing their group.  Even if the gallant engineers sit on the chair all the time.  Even if the chair is grounded. <br>  When this task stood in front of me, I googled a couple of hours and sweated before I found everything I needed.  The problem is that useful information is lost among advertisements, expensive courses and heaps of spam.  Reading this post will help in memorizing the correct answers of the tickets and tearing away the covers from why electrical safety is needed. <br>  Under the cut, I collected everything that is needed for the delivery of the second group on DL - elements of legislation, preparation methods, tickets with answers and theory.  Large amounts of information collected in spoilers.  Open what you need.  No ads, and of course, ducks! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/918/131/d2d/918131d2d929a8160ccd2ba54febf431.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  When an engineer is assigned to a group, he is issued an appropriate certificate.  This certificate says that the lyrical hero has the right to perform certain works, and the responsibility that falls on him in case of emergency situations is strictly regulated.  It all begins, as a rule, from group II.

If you are preparing to surrender to a category, this is definitely not superfluous.  By the way, it is written in such a way that it does not tend to sleep. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">The concept of electrical safety.</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">Electrical injury.</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">Information on the classification of injuries, loops of passage and step voltage (about how, which go goose step).</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><a name="Go41"></a><br>  <b>Electrical safety</b> is understood as a system of organizational and technical measures to protect a person from the effects of damaging factors of electric current. <br>  <b>Electrical injury</b> - the result of human exposure to electric current and electric arc. <br>  An electric current passing through a living organism produces: <br><ul><li>  thermal (thermal) action, which is expressed in burns of certain parts of the body, heating of blood vessels, blood, nerve fibers, etc .; </li><li>  electrolytic (biochemical) action - expressed in the decomposition of blood and other organic liquids, causing significant disruption of their physico-chemical compositions; </li><li>  biological (mechanical) action - expressed in the stimulation and stimulation of living tissues of the body, accompanied by involuntary convulsive contraction of muscles (including the heart, lungs). </li></ul><br>  Electrical injuries include: <br><ul><li>  electric burns (current, contact arc, and also combined); </li><li>  electrical signs ("tags"), skin metallization; </li><li> mechanical damage; </li><li>  electrophthalmia; </li><li>  electric shock (electric shock). </li></ul><br>  Depending on the effects of electric shocks are divided into four degrees: <br><ul><li>  muscle contraction without loss of consciousness; </li><li>  muscle contraction with loss of consciousness; </li><li>  loss of consciousness with impaired breathing or cardiac activity; </li><li>  a state of clinical death due to cardiac fibrillation or asphyxiation (asphyxiation). </li></ul><br>  <b>The main adverse effects that may occur due to electric shock:</b> <br>  The flow of electric current through human organs can cause cardiac arrest, respiration;  muscle breaks, brain damage, burns.  Such damages are characteristic of a striking current of more than 10 milliamperes, but even the sensation current (1-2 mA) can scare a person, as a result of which mechanical injuries are not excluded (for example, due to a fall from a height). <br>  <b>The main factors determining the outcome of a lesion are:</b> <br><ul><li>  current and voltage value; </li><li>  duration of exposure to current; </li><li>  body resistance; </li><li>  loop ("path") current; </li><li>  psychological readiness to strike. </li></ul><br>  <b>Current and voltage</b> <br>  Electric current, as a striking factor, determines the degree of physiological effects on humans.  Voltage should be considered only as a factor causing the flow of a particular current in specific conditions - the greater the voltage of touch, the more damaging the current. <br>  <b>According to the degree of physiological impact, the following striking currents can be distinguished:</b> <br><ul><li>  0.8 - 1.2 mA - threshold sensible current (that is, the lowest current value that a person begins to sense); </li><li>  10 - 16 mA - threshold non-releasing (riveting) current, when, due to convulsive contraction of hands, a person cannot free himself from current-carrying parts; </li><li>  100 mA - threshold fibrillation current;  It is a calculated shock current.  It should be borne in mind that the probability of hitting such a current is 50% with a duration of exposure to at least 0.5 seconds. </li></ul><br>  <b>It should be noted that no voltage can be considered completely safe and work without protective equipment.</b> <br>  So, for example, a car battery has a voltage of 12-15 volts and does not cause an electric shock when touched (the current through the human body is less than the threshold sensible current).  But if the battery terminals are accidentally closed, a powerful arc arises, which can severely burn the skin or retina of the eyes;  mechanical injuries are also possible (a person instinctively recoils from the arc and may fall unsuccessfully).  Similarly, a person instinctively recoils when touching a network of temporary lighting (36 volts, current is already felt), which threatens to fall from a height, even if the current flowing through the body is small and could not cause defeat by itself. <br>  Thus, arbitrarily low voltage does not negate the use of protective equipment, but only changes their nomenclature (type), for example, when working with a battery, you should use protective glasses.  <b>Work on current-carrying parts without the use of protective equipment is possible only with the complete removal of voltage!</b> <br>  <b>The duration of the current.</b> <br>  It has been established that electric shock is possible only in the standing of complete rest of the human heart, when there is no contraction (systole) or relaxation (diastole) of the ventricles of the heart and atria.  Therefore, for a short time, the effect of the current may not coincide with the phase of complete relaxation, but anything that increases the pace of the heart‚Äôs work contributes to an increased likelihood of heart failure when an electric shock of any duration occurs.  These reasons include: fatigue, agitation, hunger, thirst, fear, taking alcohol, drugs, certain drugs, smoking, illness, etc. <br>  <b>Body resistance</b> <br>  The value is non-constant, depends on the specific conditions, varies from a few hundred ohms to several meg.  With a sufficient degree of accuracy, we can assume that when exposed to a voltage of industrial frequency of 50 Hertz, the resistance of the human body is an active quantity consisting of internal and external components.  The internal resistance of all people is about the same and is 600 - 800 ohms.  From this we can conclude that the resistance of the human body is mainly determined by the size of the external resistance, and specifically the state of the skin of the hands with a thickness of only 0.2 mm (first of all, its outer layer - the epidermis). <br>  There are many examples of this, here is one of them.  The worker lowers the middle and index fingers of the hand into the electrolytic bath and receives a fatal blow.  It turned out that the cause of death was a cut on the skin of one of the fingers.  The epidermis did not exert its protective effect, and the defeat occurred at a clearly safe loop of current. <br>  Indeed, if we evaluate this fact in relative terms and take the skin resistance for 1, then the resistance of internal tissues, bones, lymph, blood will be 0.15 - 0.20, and the resistance of nerve fibers is only 0.025 (‚Äúnerves‚Äù are excellent conductors of electric current!) .  By the way, this is why the application of electrodes to the so-called acupuncture points is dangerous.  Since they are connected by nerve fibers, a striking current can occur at very low voltages.  It is one of these cases described in the literature, when the defeat of a person occurred at a voltage of 5 volts.  The resistance of the body is not constant: in conditions of high humidity, it decreases 12 times, in water 25 times, sharply reduces its alcohol intake. <br>  Thus, the factors of a person‚Äôs condition that significantly increase the probability of a fatal injury to a person by electric current include: <br><ul><li>  anything that increases the pace of the heart - fatigue, arousal, taking alcohol, drugs, certain drugs, smoking, illness; </li><li>  anything that reduces skin resistance - sweating, cuts, alcohol intake. </li></ul><br>  <b>The path ("loop") of the current through the human body.</b> <br>  When investigating accidents related to exposure to electric current, first of all it turns out which way the current flowed.  A person can touch current-carrying parts (or metal non-current-carrying parts that may be under stress) with a variety of body parts.  Hence the variety of possible paths of current. <br>  The most likely are the following: <br><ul><li>  ‚ÄúRight hand - legs‚Äù (20% of cases of defeat); </li><li>  ‚ÄúLeft hand - legs‚Äù (17%); </li><li>  ‚ÄúBoth arms are legs‚Äù (12%); </li><li>  ‚ÄúHead - legs‚Äù (5%); </li><li>  ‚ÄúHand - hand‚Äù (40%); </li><li>  ‚ÄúLeg - leg‚Äù (6%). </li></ul><br>  All loops, except the last, are called ‚Äúbig‚Äù or ‚Äúfull‚Äù loops, the current captures the heart area and they are the most dangerous.  In these cases, 8-12 percent of the total current flow through the heart.  The leg-leg loop is called ‚Äúsmall‚Äù; only 0.4 percent of the total current flows through the heart.  This loop occurs when a person is in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãcurrent spreading, falling under the step voltage. <br>  <b>Step</b> voltage is the voltage between two points of the earth, due to the spreading of current in the ground, while simultaneously touching them with the feet of a person.  In this case, the wider the step, the more current flows through the legs. <br>  Such a current path does not pose a direct danger to life, but under its action a person can fall and the path of current flow becomes life-threatening. <br>  For protection against step voltage are additional means of protection - dielectric bots, dielectric mats.  In the case when the use of these means is not possible, one should leave the spreading area so that the distance between the feet on the ground is minimal - short steps.  It is also safe to move on a dry board and other dry, non-conductive objects. <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/176219/">To the spoiler cap</a> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/176219/">To the beginning of the article</a> <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Electrical safety in existing electrical installations up to 1000 volts.</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">Manufacturing jobs.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><a name="Go42"></a><br>  <b>Electrical installations</b> are those in which electricity is produced, converted and consumed.  Electrical installations include mobile and stationary sources of electricity, electrical networks, switchgear and connected current collectors. <br>  <b>The existing electrical installations</b> are installations that are fully or partially under voltage or to which voltage can be supplied at any time by switching on the switching equipment. <br>  According to the degree of danger of injury to personnel by electrical current, electrical installations are subdivided into electrical installations <b>up to 1000 volts and above 1000 volts</b> . <br>  To give an order to perform work in existing electrical installations up to 1000 Volts has the right to employee management staff, having a group of electrical safety not lower than 4th. <br>  Work in electrical installations in relation to security measures are divided into the following: <br><ol><li>  with stress relief; </li><li>  without removing the voltage on the current-carrying parts and near them. </li></ol><br>  The <b>works with the removal of voltage</b> include work performed in the electrical installation (or part of it), in which voltage is removed from the current-carrying parts. <br>  <b>Works without stress relief</b> on current-carrying parts, and in the vicinity of them, are works performed directly on these parts or in the vicinity of them.  In installations with voltages higher than 1000 volts, as well as on overhead lines up to 1000 volts, the same works include those that are performed at distances from live parts less than acceptable.  Such work should be performed by at least two persons: the producer with a group not lower than IV, the rest not less than III. <br>  <b>Technical measures to ensure the safety of works with stress relief.</b> <br>  When preparing the workplace for stress relieving by operating personnel, the following technical measures should be performed in the order indicated: <br><ol><li>  necessary disconnections were made and measures were taken to prevent the supply of voltage to the work site due to the erroneous or inadvertent switching on of the switching equipment; </li><li>  Manual prohibitions and remote control switches of switching equipment contain prohibitive posters (‚ÄúDo not turn on, people work‚Äù, ‚ÄúDo not turn on, work on the line‚Äù) and, if necessary, barriers are installed; </li><li>  portable earths are connected to the ‚ÄúEarth‚Äù, the absence of voltage on the current-carrying parts, on which grounding should be applied to protect people from electric shock, is checked; </li><li>  immediately after checking the absence of voltage, grounding should be applied (grounding knives are included, and portable grounding should be installed where they are absent); </li><li>  warning and prescriptive posters were posted, workplaces and current-carrying parts that remained under voltage were fenced if necessary.  Depending on local conditions, live parts are shielded before or after grounding is applied. </li></ol><br>  All these technical measures can be carried out with a qualifying group of at least III. <br>  Work with stress relief can be done either with the imposition of grounding, or without the imposition of grounding, but with the adoption of technical measures to prevent the erroneous supply of voltage to the workplace. <br>  <b>Production outages.</b> <br>  At the work site, the live parts on which the work is performed must be disconnected, as well as those that may be accessible to the touch when performing work. <br>  Non-insulated live parts that can be touched can not be disconnected if they are securely shielded with insulating plates of dry insulating materials. <br>  Disconnection must be made in such a way that the parts of the electrical installation or electrical equipment allocated for the work are separated from all current-carrying parts under voltage, switching devices or removing fuses, as well as disconnecting the ends of cables (wires) that can be energized. work place. <br>  <b>Disconnection can be performed:</b> <br><ol><li>  switching devices with manual control, the position of the contacts can be seen from the front or can be installed by inspecting the panels from the rear, opening the shields, removing the covers.  Perform these operations must comply with security measures.  If there is full confidence that in switching devices with closed contacts, the position of the handle or pointer corresponds to the position of the contacts, then it is allowed not to remove the covers to check for tripping; </li><li>  Contactors or other switching devices with automatic drive and remote control with available inspection contacts after taking measures to eliminate the possibility of erroneous switching on (removing the fuses of the operating current, disconnecting the ends of the switching coil). </li></ol><br>  The procedure for checking the disconnected state of switching devices is established by the person issuing the order or giving the order. <br>  To prevent the supply of voltage to the workplace due to transformation, all power, measuring and various special transformers connected to both the electrical equipment being prepared for repair should be disconnected from both the high and low voltage side. <br>  In cases where the work is performed without the use of portable grounding, additional measures should be taken to prevent the erroneous supply of voltage to the workplace: mechanical locking of drives of disconnected devices, additional removal of fuses connected in series with switching devices, use of insulating plates in switches, automatic machines, etc. p. These technical measures should be specified when issuing a work order.  If it is impossible to take these additional measures, the ends of the supply or outgoing lines on the shield, assembly or directly at the work site should be disconnected;  when disconnecting the cable from the fourth (zero) core, this core should be disconnected from the zero bus. <br>  <b>Hanging warning posters, fencing work place.</b> <br>  On the handles, keys and control buttons of all switching devices, as well as on the contact racks (bases) of the fuses, with the help of which voltage can be applied to the place of work, posters ‚ÄúDo not turn on - people work‚Äù, ‚ÄúDo not turn on - work on lines. " <br>  Neighboring workplace parts not disconnected from live parts accessible to a random touch should be fenced during operation. <br>  Temporary fences can be dry, well fortified screens, lining of wood, micanite, getinaksa, textolite, rubber, etc. On temporary fences should be posted posters "Stop - dangerous to life." <br>  Before installing fences, dust must be carefully wiped off. <br>  The installation of fences applied directly to live parts should be made with care, in dielectric gloves and glasses, in the presence of a second person with the IV qualifying group. <br>  At all prepared work places after applying grounding, a poster ‚ÄúWork here‚Äù is posted. <br>  During the work of the brigade personnel it is <b>PROHIBITED</b> to rearrange or remove the posters and installed temporary fences and to enter the territory of the fenced areas. <br>  <b>Check the absence of voltage.</b> <br>  Before starting all work on electrical installations with the removal of voltage, you must check the absence of voltage in the work area.  The absence of voltage is checked by a voltage indicator with a neon lamp. <br>  Immediately before checking for the absence of voltage, it is necessary to make sure that the pointer used is in good condition by checking it on current-carrying parts located nearby and knowingly under voltage. <br>  <b>DO NOT use pointers with low input resistance (test lamps, LED voltage indicators, audible ‚Äúcontrols‚Äù, etc.) for checking the absence of voltage, as they do not indicate induced voltage that is dangerous to human life.</b> <br>  The absence of voltage should be checked: <br><ul><li>  between three pairs of phases; </li><li>  between each phase and PE-conductor ("earth"); </li><li>  between zero working (N) and zero protective conductor (PE). </li></ul><br>  Stationary devices, signaling the disconnected state of the installation, are only an aid, on the basis of indications of which it is not allowed to conclude that there is no voltage. <br>  <b>Ground overlays.</b> <br>  Grounding should be imposed on the current-carrying parts of all phases disconnected for the production of the electrical installation from all sides, from where voltage can be applied, including due to reverse transformation. <br>  It is sufficient to overlay one side of the ground on each side.  These earthing can be separated from the current-carrying parts or equipment on which the work is performed, disconnected by disconnectors, switches, circuit breakers or fuses removed. <br>  The imposition of grounding directly on the live parts on which the work is performed, is required when these parts may be under induced voltage (potential) or they may be energized from an external source of dangerous magnitude.      ,            .               ,   ,     . <br>              . <br>                .           . <br>                              (). <br>  ,   ,       (,    ,     . .),          ,       .    :     ,               . <br>        ,        ,   ,      ,               ,   ,       .           . <br> <b>    .</b> <br>         .     ,    . <br>            ¬´¬ª.                  .            . <br>     - ,     ,        . <br>                25 2. <br>             ,        ,      . <br>          (,   ,       ,     . .),    ,   .                       ,        . <br>     ,          ,      . <br> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/176219/">  </a> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/176219/">  </a> <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler"> <b class="spoiler_title"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Rules for the use of protective equipment used in electrical installations</font></font></font></font></b> <div class="spoiler_text"> <b> .</b> <br>    , ,      ,     ,   ,    ,   ,    ,    ,     . . <br>   ,   , : <br><ul><li>   ,      ,      ; </li><li>  ,  ,  ,      ; </li><li>   , , , ,  ; </li><li>  ; </li><li>  ,  ,    ; </li><li>  ,  ,    ,  ,  . </li></ul><br>           ,   ,       .    : <br><ul><li>    ; </li><li>    . </li></ul><br> <b></b>    ,               ,  . <br>                            ,    ,           . <br> <b></b>    ,                       .        ,              . <br>      ,     ,     . <br>     ,      1000 , : <br><ul><li>  ; </li><li>    ; </li><li>  . </li></ul><br>     ,      1000 , : <br><ul><li>  ; </li><li>   ; </li><li>  . </li></ul><br>                                . <br>  ,  ,  ,            ,         . <br>          ,    .     , ,   . . <br> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/176219/">  </a> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/176219/">  </a> <br></div></div><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/564/7f3/012/5647f3012fe48028611d1620eef819da.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Questions ticket with the correct answers.

Just like that, without preparation.  See what the instructor wants from you and what the tickets are about. <br>  There are many services with such an opportunity, for example <a href="http://ohrana-truda11.ru/test-of-exam-tickets-to-rostechnadzor/ebii/">such</a> . <br>  - Having understood that you should learn, read the theory.  It is given in this article, there is still a <a href="http://www.mtcatheer.com/category/j/">good link</a> .  If all this is not enough for you, for the full and final enlightenment, read  and .  But the chances of falling asleep under this are much higher.  And the documents on 200 p. - Fiction on an amateur. <br>  - Reading the theory, solve tests.  There are not so many questions, they will be remembered. <br>  - Do not come to the test formally.  All these rules are written not only in blood, but also in soot, for the reasons stated above.  Yes, and extra knowledge is never superfluous. <br><br><h4>  PS or what else </h4><br>  After 4-5 months, apparently, I will pass the third category, I plan to write a similar article.  Good luck to us all, and grounded chairs! <br><br><h4>  PSS and most importantly </h4><br>  Never, never try to measure the current in the outlet!  Electrical safety in this case, you just do not pass! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c52/3c7/f4d/c523c7f4de79c251f6dae952f5c62628.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/176219/">https://habr.com/ru/post/176219/</a></p>
