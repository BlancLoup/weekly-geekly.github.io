You can't just sit at the computer and not create something like that.  That both brought benefit, and slightly pleased an eye or two eyes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, continuing to use the remaining aluminum sheet from the previous <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/456966/">device</a> , in the same industrial format, it was decided to replace the home server.  Because, it was too many services hung on it, one.  And the time has come, to replace desktop hardware with the real server one.  And instead of a single operating system, with many services, a hypervisor was installed, with guest OSes for each service. <br><br>  And the work began to boil ... for half a year. <br><br>  The starting points for building the case were the size of the board, the SSI CEB format, and three 120mm fans.  They needed to be placed as compactly as possible, as well as leaving space for the power supply and disks.

      Pre-scribed the dimensions of the body on paper, and then proceeded to sawing.  And so, the frame of the future corps acquired rectangular shapes and the necessary dimensions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tb/ng/d-/tbngd-jjyx0pi_qgfleuho-ohzy.jpeg"><br><br>  The boundaries of the hull were created, and now the most interesting thing has begun, crammed in or out.  Made cardboard boxes, the size of the disk array and power supply, and began to play Tetris. <br><br>  It turned out that with any placement, the standard power supply didn‚Äôt fit into the established frames.  I had to resort to tough measures - to halve it.  Yes, I‚Äôll also say that when I purchased the power supply, I was already thinking that its electronic filling, along with the radiators, should be low.  Here it is, what was before the polishing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zw/vp/dw/zwvpdwe5jlykfc1xkxm2lpge_ya.jpeg"><br><br>  But after sawing off.  It was a pity, but progress is inexorable, we cut off all unnecessary without a doubt. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qp/nn/jt/qpnnjtg1ljynu3ubdrvi_ziejoe.jpeg"><br><br>  Question.  What about cooling the power supply?  Answer.  And so come down! <br><br>  No, not the right answer, we expect that three 120mm fans will be able to cool all the hot electronics inside the case.  And add another one, especially for the power supply.  But where?  More on that later. <br><br>  Leaving the power supply in the open is absolutely impossible, so I went in search of an aluminum grid sheet.  But, long searches were not crowned with success, and here, in one car shop, I see that it is worth it.  The air filter for the "Gazelle" - EKOFIL 104, mesh size and fineness of the fabric fits perfectly.  Here is the result. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ur/wq/vy/urwqvyaz3j5dpqmi8izpgksmfdy.jpeg"><br><br>  Now, the turn has reached the disk array.  After playing Tetris, it turned out to place two 3.5 ‚Äùand three 2.5‚Äù disks diagonally from the power supply, and a basket for a 3.5 ‚Äùdisk opposite. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/hn/9d/xqhn9d8nqhy2pwsbkyn1l1lh7te.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xp/dn/41/xpdn41zl3zwhomt68bpa6oowpyy.jpeg"><br><br>  It was disturbing that the discs, as the most traumatized element in the system, were not recoverable, except for one.  Unfortunately, at that time, I did not see a way out of this situation, it was decided to leave it as it is. <br><br>  So let's continue.  On the marked and prepared places we install the motherboard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/21/mu/qi/21muqikbdjjeyzzx5hwmm3pgfmm.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_y/w1/uk/_yw1ukvdgqi6b2pr-cvagw9jupy.jpeg"><br><br>  And we see that the RAM is in an inaccessible place, right under the power supply.  We take this into account before the final installation of the motherboard, we install processors, radiators and memory modules on it. <br><br>  The insides are collected and ta-dam.  I forgot something, but how can I turn it on, closing the contacts with a screwdriver? <br><br>  A metal button was found in the bins, the place for which was found on the front panel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/es/lk/lj/eslkljknkxhewhzpj4ouff3jcm8.jpeg"><br><br>  Well, at last everything is assembled, and with a shaking hand, slowly bending down the index finger, with an unhurried motion, briefly press the button and now ... The quiet noise of the turning on fans, POST passing, the picture on the monitor and YES, this is a small victory! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ez/qs/jo/ezqsjo1pavajf3gstjnsmjowtkg.jpeg"><br><br>  Server live.  And work for the good, providing all kinds of services. <br><br>  It remains the case for small, to hang the wall, after cutting out the holes for the removable disk and additional blowing power supply.  For additional airflow 120mm fan was used with a thickness of 10mm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xz/9-/xq/xz9-xqdhphhcc7uxelwgvl3bimu.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/67/br/iv/67brivslcdanu7e9c-atqpobkhu.jpeg"><br><br>  Installed a RAID controller. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7y/s5/f4/7ys5f4srbgiwshskb-yk5ilk1ck.jpeg"><br><br>  All wires to the maximum fastened. <br><br>  And here is the finished version, you can clean up on the shelf, install the hypervisor, deploy guest OS, raise services. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/em/cb/i-/emcbi-yx_6qvhizvcgh8pzhuznq.jpeg"><br><br>  Everything was so, but she could not calm down to find an engineering soul.  Drives how to remove? <br>  And a solution was found - a four-disc basket for 2.5 ‚Äùdisks (Chenbro 84H323410-005), instead of two 3.5‚Äù and three 2.5 ‚Äùdisks.  And again the file and the screwdriver started to dance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9y/us/ar/9yusarvnzrdq6kil-aa7jbale4s.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xx/k1/44/xxk144zyrn6bhrwtb-f5lrhuj5y.jpeg"><br><br>  Well, now, you can stop, relax, think? <br><br>  And again, start collecting components for the new server. <br><br>  Why?  The appetite is growing, there is already not enough memory, out of 16 GB of RAM, 14 GB is already occupied. <br><br>  To be continued‚Ä¶ </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/459769/">https://habr.com/ru/post/459769/</a></p>
