In RuNet, there is very little information about this wonderful programming language and the framework based on it.  We decided to correct this error and talk about popular high-load sites on this technology, as well as give a lot of interesting technical details.  For the convenience of comparing sites to each other, we also bring some statistics to each of the projects.  In general, Python / Django sites, of course, are very numerous in the world; we will cover only the most interesting ones in our opinion. <br><br>  A small table of known projects (based on <a href="http://builtwith.com/">http://builtwith.com/</a> ), clickable: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br> <a href="http://seclgroup.ru/article_vysokonagruzhennyye_sayty_i_prilozheniya_na_python_django.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7bb/771/f6a/7bb771f6a2bb1e234e98f313c3f347e3.png" alt="Zoom"></a> <br><br>  The big version of the table here: <a href="http://seclgroup.ru/article_vysokonagruzhennyye_sayty_i_prilozheniya_na_python_django.html">http://seclgroup.ru/article_vysokonagruzhennyye_sayty_i_prilozheniya_na_python_django.html</a>

Python is a very interesting modern programming language, which is now very quickly gaining popularity, both in the West and in Russian Internet.  About the advantages of Python / Django, we have already written a small note.  At the moment we are seeing a great demand for programming in Python / Django, because this is quality!  Demand for projects creates demand for specialists. <br><br>  If you want to develop a highly loaded project, then we recommend to consider Python / Django as a technical platform.  Well, for colleagues, if you want to become a programmer or learn a new programming language, Python would be one of the best options. <br><br>  <b>Python courses</b> .
