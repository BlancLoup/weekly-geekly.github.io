Part 1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  From June 18 to July 19, 2007 with the support of the Softkey store and <br>  Many bloggers (thanks to everyone!) conducted a <a href="http://blogbook.ru/2007/06/18/kak-blogosfera-otzovyotsya/">survey about blogs</a> .  1012 people took part in it, who answered 11 questions.  Survey results present to your attention below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/58b/825/066/58b825066fe97978ca3d06be9e962435.gif"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We asked about the motives for blogging and reading.  Those who think about attention and gain influence in the blogosphere should be primarily interested in why people read blogs. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      So, “obtaining useful information” is of interest to 69% of all responding blog readers.  The answers “have fun, relax” and “facilitate communication, acquaintances” scored an almost equal number of votes, each with a small percentage of 40 percent.  Another quarter of the respondents read online diaries, "to remain an expert in their field."  One respondent reads blogs “to live.”  So - no more, no less.  By the way, only 5 people out of 1012 of all survey participants asked “what is a blog?”. <br><br>  With blogging motivations, the situation has not changed much from <br>  October 2006, when Suscribe.ru conducted a <a title="What they write and want to read" href="http://blogbook.ru/2007/05/18/pro-chto-pishut-i-chto-hotyat-chitat/">similar study</a> .  In the first place - "self-expression" and "communication, meeting new people."  Interestingly, 25.6% of bloggers lead <br>  diaries in order to expand their horizons and 19% - to maintain the expert level in their field.  Someone replied that he kept a diary for “storing useful data”, “draining ideas there, so as not to forget them, and to make room for new ones,” and simply “want to”. <br><br>  The second set of questions related to blogs on which topics are / would like to lead and read / would like to read.  Comparison in pairs present / future allows you to track the dynamics of changes in attitudes to certain topics and even make some predictions. <br><br>  &lt;img alt = "What blogs read and want to read" <br>  src = " <a href="">habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/1fa/acf/199/1faacf199bd4dbefbe8bb2c4b87703af.gif</a> " /&gt; <br><br>  Although blogs about “Internet” and “Computers, Software” are read by more than half of the respondents, in the future their positions may falter.  This is typical for <br>  of the Internet as a whole: with the arrival of the broad masses, IT professionals lost <br>  the first places are “ordinary” and diverse topics.  Same thing happen and <br>  with blogs. <br><br>  Of the topics that are not enough now, and that the survey participants are ready to read more actively in the future: “Travel, rest” and “Books, literature, poems”.  I suspect that the topic of travel has received such attention because of the vacation season, in which the survey was conducted.  From non-standard topics, readers want to see blogs about “entrepreneurial experience”, “design”, game development or “creative and bright personalities” in the future.  Someone replied that he reads blogs regularly, “which were bookmarked,” and someone only for HR or “personal effectiveness.” <br>  One answer was knocked out of the general mass: “To none of the above <br>  However, they do not relate, but I will not name them for you, since you can marvel at human stupidity. ” <br><br>  &lt;img alt = "What blogs lead and want to keep" <br>  src = " <a href="">habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/bab/46b/ace/bab46bace09090792a0f205398e5cc1a.gif</a> " /&gt; <br><br>  The bad thing is that many bloggers don’t single out one topic and write “about everything <br>  little by little, "or they describe their diary as" yes, I pop it in the air. "  This approach only leads to a loss of focus, and does not contribute to an increase in the number of readers. <br><br>  Many bloggers responded in the spirit that they are already blogging on all the topics they are interested in.  However, there are still unfulfilled desires: almost 12% of survey participants want to blog about “auto”, “economy and business”, “travel and leisure”.  And already lead on the same topics blogs at 2% less. <br><br>  Of the desired topics of their future online diaries, people stated “psychology”, “Christianity”, “wrestling, IT” ... One menacingly-minded comrade is going to blog about “how to deal with advertisers and their physical elimination”. <br><br>  From the difference between the future preferences of readers and the real interests of bloggers, one can build such a “comb of perspectives”.  In addition, there are topics that have a positive dynamic of interests, and a minus - negative dynamics. <br><br>  &lt;img alt = “Blog Themes - Perspective Comb” <br>  src = " <a href="">habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/ac4/1d8/1a4/ac41d81a42defdbae4c699ee08bb6714.gif</a> " /&gt; <br><br>  The most unpromising was the theme “life, love”, into which also <br>  includes personal diaries.  If the number of authors of such diaries is not <br>  going to drastically shrink, then new readers on this topic <br>  will have to search.  In the end, everything will come to a situation characteristic <br>  for Western blogs - the author of the personal diary reads 10-15 of his <br>  personal friends. <br><br>  Among the promising topics (the size of the readers' desires will be <br>  more than the content of standing authors) includes "News", "Books, <br>  literature, poems "," Cinema "," Economy, business "," Auto "," Photos, <br>  video ”,“ Computers, software ”and“ Travel, rest ”.  As you can see, among them <br>  There are quite "commercial" topics.  And also it shows the potential <br>  Readers' demand for corporate blogs. <br><br>  We will talk about corporate blogs in part 2, which I have the other day <br>  I will publish in the <a href="http://blogbook.ru/">blogbook</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/287444/">https://habr.com/ru/post/287444/</a></p>
