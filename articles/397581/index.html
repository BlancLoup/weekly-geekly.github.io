Today we will look at a convenient Arduino-compatible controller for controlling light and sound;  "Smart" thermos with built-in heating;  comfortable Bluetooth headphones and a physical (!) siren of missed calls / messages / notifications. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Firecricket </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/298/de9/f66/298de9f66ba840738c58706771f49a96.png"><br><br>  <b><a href="http://rabidprototypes.com/">Rabid Prototypes</a></b> ' <b>Firecricket</b> project is an Arduino-compatible microcontroller designed to control sound, light and motion effects.  On board is a 32-bit ARM Cortex M0 + with a frequency of 48 MHz, 16 KB of memory and a microSD slot.  To encode / decode signals, there are three 12-bit ADC channels, a 10-bit DAC.  Digital I / O - 12 PWM and 2 I / O.  Complemented with its own 2.5-watt audio amplifier (TPS6211A1) and a power transistor with the ability to control toy motors and 3-watt LEDs.

      The project scored the required amount for the launch - instead of $ 2,500 at the time of publication, almost 4,000 were raised. There is another 15 days ahead. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rabidprototypes/firecricket-bring-your-replica-props-to-life">Participate in the promotion (start from $ 27)</a> <br><br><h3>  ¬∞ CELSIUS </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/945/3f8/710/9453f87103384ee985c86c42d442e0d4.png">  Strange, but nevertheless very popular and attractive project of the <a href="http://www.celsiuscollection.com/">same name startup</a> .  This beautiful jug hides the battery and the adjustable thermostat and is designed as a miniature, modern field kitchen.  With very small dimensions.  Able to heat the contents to the required temperature, boil water, boil.  Included with the gadget, you can purchase several additional built-in containers that allow you to cook several separate servings at once or boil tea. <br><br>  The ¬∞ CELSIUS is isothermal, so if you need to, you can pour / put something cold on it.  A warm or cook - if necessary.  The most interesting thing is that the gadget is charging via standard microUSB, so that problems with a small capacity of a standard replaceable battery are not expected (of course, if you do not use the unit as a stopover). <br><br>  The project has already collected the necessary 49 thousand dollars.  There are 29 days ahead, so you can join the financing. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/celsius/celsius-a-multipurpose-food-and-beverage-heating-d">Participate in the promotion (start from 79-99 dollars)</a> <br><br><h3>  BE-Bop Buds </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/92b/88b/20d/92b88b20d44d49f5beaa1db4e59c7f3b.jpg"><br><br>  Already the fourth <b><a href="http://beheadwear.com/">BE-LINK Bluetooth Integration System</a></b> project.  An alternative to the new Apple headphones is cross-platform, with an interesting design (for taste and color, of course), a built-in microphone and Siri support.  Included is a convenient docking station that will allow you to charge from both a regular USB and a micro version.  The dock has its own battery, designed for 3 full charges.  Unfortunately, the operating time of the kit does not exceed 3 hours, and the replenishment time of the built-in batteries last an hour.  Maybe partly it can be forgiven - to the headphones, in contrast to the mass of analogs, an additional mount in the auricle, a rather interesting design, is attached. <br><br>  The project has another 54 days ahead, and twice the starting price has been collected. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/be-bop-earbuds/be-bop-buds-wireless-earbuds-be-cord-free">Participate in the project (start from 79 dollars)</a> <br><br><h3>  Dot </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/22e/d9b/6be/22ed9b6bed0946a3b38e6709fcaca072.png"><br><br>  A small indicator that can be placed on any surface and connected with a smartphone via Bluetooth.  In the application, you can configure what exactly the Dot will signal - and even now its capabilities seem endless.  With the help of a multi-color LED, you can teach the device to notify about weather, important news and events, to signal missed alerts, to remind about events in the calendar, the need to make purchases and everything that can be signaled.  In addition, the device works as a label, and launches applications in accordance with the user's preferences already tracked: in accordance with the place and time.  It is assumed that with the help of Dot it will be possible to track the user's location, and run previously created scripts to control the "smart home".  The developers promise open API, support for iOS, Android and Java-Script. <br><br>  9 days left.  But the project will still be launched - it collected 5 times more than necessary. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1867163750/dot-the-physical-push-notification">Participate in the project (start from $ 20)</a> <br><br><h3>  PS How to buy on Kickstarter, if the project creators send out only in the USA </h3><br>  Unfortunately, not all projects offer international delivery.  But any of them can be issued using the service for sending goods from the United States <a href="http://pochtoy.com/">Pochtoy.com</a> : just register and get a virtual address. <br><br>  It is on him and need to arrange delivery of the project took place.  As soon as the shipment takes place, and the gadget arrives at our warehouse, the corresponding notification will come.  After you can complete the package with something interesting, choose a delivery method, pay for it and receive it at your nearest post office or directly at home. <br><br>  In the event that Kickstarter does not allow you to pay with your own card, you can use the American Pochtoy.com accounts using the ‚Äú <a href="http://pochtoy.com/page/how_to/">Full Escort</a> ‚Äù service, which you can read about in detail <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/pochtoy/blog/279572/">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397581/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397581/</a></p>
