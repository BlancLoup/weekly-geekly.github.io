Today we will announce the names of the winners in each of the nominations.  But that is not all.  Below we also note the works that didn‚Äôt have enough before the victory, tell them why the authors should continue the work and give the first details about the closing ceremony of the competition. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  WGDC had to spend at least for the sake of a huge feedback from the developer community, which allowed us to establish a dialogue with it and identify problem areas for further development of the service.

      Starting the competition, we clearly understood that the need for it exists and the community will surely be willing to fight for the prizes.  What we did not expect was this amount of work.  We knew that serious players would participate in the contest, but by default we were ready to search for diamonds among the ‚Äúloot the cows‚Äù and the ideas of the ‚Äú3D actions‚Äù.  In the end, it all came down to a heated debate and a difficult choice of fairly strong work.  Here are the results. <br><br><h4>  Winners and awardees </h4><br>  <b>Nomination "The best modification of the game client World of Tanks"</b> <br><br>  <b>1 place.</b>  <b><a href="http://special.habrahabr.ru/wgdc/project/53d67d93a4ff7afda700834d/">Battle Assistant.</a></b> <br><br>  The modification changes the UX of the game, the gameplay itself, making it more comfortable and convenient for some players, but it does not provide a game advantage.  Few could compare with this mod, largely because it reveals one of the main ideas of the competition: the game belongs to the community, which changes it to fit its needs. <br><br>  <b>2nd place.</b>  <b><a href="http://special.habrahabr.ru/wgdc/project/53ec63c5a4ff7af40c00834d/">Customizable tank carousel.</a></b> <br><br>  Pleasant refinement from the XVM team for the hangar.  The mod allows you to display a lot of useful statistical information on the icon of the tank itself, which saves a lot of time for fans to track their progress without leaving the game client. <br><br>  <b>3rd place.</b>  <b><a href="http://special.habrahabr.ru/wgdc/project/53dfd846a4ff7a608000834d/">Miku Hangar (version 2.0)</a> .</b> <br><br>  Very high quality in terms of art design work.  Surely the Asian market will like it.  The work feels the love of people for what they do.  The project does not change the functionality of the game, but from an aesthetic point of view it is beautiful.  Fun fact: some jury members and simply Wargaming developers left Miku Hangar in the client even after testing and evaluating it. <br><br>  <b>Nomination "Best Functional Project"</b> <br><br>  <b>1 place.</b>  <b><a href="http://special.habrahabr.ru/wgdc/project/53d58012a4ff7a5d7e00834d/">WoTBase</a> .</b> <br><br>  During the competition, the guys made an excellent project in terms of functionality, which was based on the Encyclopedia of the World of Tanks and their own developments. <br><br>  Particularly noteworthy is the functionality of playing replays.  Already, cyber sports teams and clan fighters can analyze in detail all the moments of the last battle.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project can be an indispensable element of the broadcasts of Wargaming League matches. <br><br>  <b>2nd place.</b>  <b><a href="http://special.habrahabr.ru/wgdc/project/53df7a33a4ff7a088100834d/">Portal ivanerr.ru</a> .</b> <br><br>  This is a pre-contest project for the clan community.  During the competition, the functionality of the project was substantially refined, which allowed him to compete for the top places. <br><br>  <b>3rd place.</b>  <b><a href="http://special.habrahabr.ru/wgdc/project/53df5740a4ff7abd4600834d/">Alphabet - World of Warplanes</a> .</b> <br><br>  News portal for World of Warplanes, which was developed as part of the competition.  Good work in itself, plus it is worth noting the fact that this is a project implemented not for a tank audience, but for ‚Äúpilots‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Nomination "Best mobile application / application for social networks"</b> <br><br>  <b>1 place.</b>  <b><a href="http://special.habrahabr.ru/wgdc/project/53d72806a4ff7a0dca00834d/">Armor Inspector</a> .</b> <br><br>  App for iOS and Android.  Allows users to further explore their favorite game, determining the chances of penetration of any armored vehicle.  Often, our players ask the question: ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt I pierce a particular tank?‚Äù.  This application allows you to thoroughly understand the situation by selecting the gun, the type of projectile and reproducing the direction of the shot. <br><br>  <b>2nd place.</b>  <b><a href="http://special.habrahabr.ru/wgdc/project/53d58259a4ff7a5d7e008351/">Knowledge Base for WoT</a> .</b> <br><br>  Mobile analogue of the web-project, which took the first place in the nomination ‚ÄúThe best functional project‚Äù.  Since the application existed before, we evaluated only the improvements made during the competition.  They were enough to finish only second, but this is a great success for a small team of two people. <br><br>  <b>3rd place.</b>  <b><a href="http://special.habrahabr.ru/wgdc/project/53e3e381a4ff7a503e00834d/">WoT Tactics</a> .</b> <br><br>  This is a prototype of an online game for Android and iOS tablets.  Perhaps the only project that threatened to create a full-fledged game within the competition.  We are sure that if the team had more time to finalize the gameplay, UX interface and control, then WoT Tactics could claim victory in the nomination.  We hope very much that the project will not stop in its development and will receive the deserved recognition of the community. <br><br>  <b>Nomination ‚ÄúFor contribution to the development of products and services for the Wargaming community‚Äù</b> <br><br>  <b>1 place.</b>  <b><a href="http://special.habrahabr.ru/wgdc/project/53ce6ecea4ff7a90b600834d/">Wot-News.Com</a> .</b> <br><br>  The most popular news portal from the community.  On the site, players can find almost everything: from news, promotions and videos to detailed statistics and ratings.  The resource is visited daily by hundreds of thousands of "tankers." <br><br>  <b>2nd place.</b>  <b><a href="http://special.habrahabr.ru/wgdc/project/53ed28a2a4ff7ae329008351/">CLANTANK.RU</a> .</b> <br><br>  One of the best sites for administering clans, checking statistics and socialization between clerks.  The site provides clan players with the ability to track player activity in the clan and its effectiveness.  The project also implemented a convenient tool to search for applicants for the clan membership for recruiters. <br><br>  <b>3rd place.</b>  <b><a href="http://special.habrahabr.ru/wgdc/project/53ea0510a4ff7ad28700834d/">WOT API</a> .</b> <br><br>  Before the launch of the public APIs from Wargaming, this project was one of the few alternatives to receiving data from our servers and gave impetus to the development of third-party projects.  This resource also gave us to understand the need to launch the Wargaming Developer Partner Program and publish the Wargaming Public API. <br><br>  <b>Nomination "The best idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project"</b> <br><br>  <b>1 place.</b>  <b><a href="http://special.habrahabr.ru/wgdc/project/53ee1bfaa4ff7a411400834d/">wotlogger.ru</a> .</b> <br><br>  This is a finished project.  The main project functionality (statistics collection) was performed by the client application.  During the competition, the project team was going to replace the client application with a mod to the game client, but did not manage to meet the allotted time.  The peculiarity of the idea is to collect statistics on the fly using mod. <br><br>  <b>2nd place.</b>  <b><a href="http://special.habrahabr.ru/wgdc/project/53e8fd84a4ff7ac83b00834d/">Extended statistics on the official site</a> .</b> <br><br>  The project was made, but quite a bit did not reach the top place in the "project" nomination.  The idea itself is just great. <br><br>  <b>3rd place.</b>  <b><a href="http://special.habrahabr.ru/wgdc/project/53edbeb8a4ff7a956f00834d/">WOT CLANS Services</a> .</b> <br><br>  Good service idea for clans.  It stands out against the background of other ideas with the most detailed elaboration.  We look forward to hearing from the author of the finished project in the near future. <br><br>  <b>"Special Prize of the Jury of the Competition"</b> <br><br>  <b><a href="http://special.habrahabr.ru/wgdc/project/53d7bf81a4ff7af02b00834d/">Xvm</a></b> <br><br>  The project, which regularly uses 3.2 million tankers around the world.  1.3 million users play with advanced settings for this mod.  An independent team has been developing the project for more than three years, and in terms of the total effort, personal time and effort it has no equal.  The guys have been trying to improve the life of the gaming community for many years: they deserve not only respect and praise, but also official recognition. <br><br>  Very soon, representatives of Habr will contact all the winners-residents of the CIS countries, and Wargaming - with residents of other countries for the delivery of cash prizes. <br><br>  Those who carefully read the official rules of the competition, noticed that in July we secured the amount of prize money in Russian rubles.  Worry about this is not worth it.  We will not allow currency fluctuations to depreciate the WGDS prize fund: the winners and prize winners will receive a sum in rubles, but at the current rate for today, on the day of the announcement of the winners. <br><br><h4>  Go on, we are interested </h4><br>  In this post, we can not ignore the work, left without prizes, but worthy to talk about them. <br><br>  Among the applicants in the nomination <b>"Best Functional Project"</b> I would like to mention two works. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://special.habrahabr.ru/wgdc/project/53eb838aa4ff7a984500834f/">WoWpRevs</a></b> and <b><a href="http://special.habrahabr.ru/wgdc/project/53c7fa6ba4ff7a337500834d/">WoTRevs</a></b> <br><br>  Reviews and rating of players.  Good execution of the site, there are rough edges, but they all relate to the wishes. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://special.habrahabr.ru/wgdc/project/53ccb1aaa4ff7a090900834d/">Full skill</a></b> <br><br>  A huge amount of data on all sorts of ratings, a lot of divisions for various types of statistics (detailed statistics for tanks, tanks at the level). <br><br>  *** <br><br>  Among the <b>best mobile apps / social networking apps, the</b> jury hooked on competing projects. <br><br>  Humorous MMO games portal from Wargaming is now available on mobile devices thanks to WarPlay and WarGag mobile application developers. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://special.habrahabr.ru/wgdc/project/53cab6f5a4ff7aacc500834d/">WarPlay</a></b> has the ability to sort content by project, as well as adding entries to your favorites.  The project is designed in the style of Wargaming. <br><br>  As for <b><a href="http://special.habrahabr.ru/wgdc/project/53e5fa2da4ff7aef2400834f/">WarGag mobile,</a></b> it is worth noting that the application is implemented for different OS: iOS and Android. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  In the nomination <b>‚ÄúFor contribution to the development of products and services for the Wargaming community‚Äù</b> , <b><a href="http://special.habrahabr.ru/wgdc/project/53e8b8e0a4ff7a1b5a00834d/">uWarrior.net</a></b> claimed <b><a href="http://special.habrahabr.ru/wgdc/project/53e8b8e0a4ff7a1b5a00834d/">prizes</a></b> . <br><br>  uWarrior.net is a ready-made social network for players of the Wargaming.net universe, where the statistics, clans and other data are the basis for communication.  However, there is much to add. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  Among the huge number of <b>ideas</b> that did not fall into the prizes, the non-standard and scientific approach remembered <b><a href="http://special.habrahabr.ru/wgdc/project/53ea59fda4ff7a91f300834d/">"Performing an in-game task to assess the functional state of the player to optimize his actions and issue recommendations</a></b> . <b><a href="http://special.habrahabr.ru/wgdc/project/53ea59fda4ff7a91f300834d/">"</a></b> <br><br>  The author went beyond most of the proposed model ideas.  The project is briefly, but thoroughly described - both from the position of a good player in World of Tanks, and the Master of Medical Sciences. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  At the very beginning of the competition, we talked about the fact that the best of the best will receive recognition and access to the multimillion audience of Wargaming projects.  The presence among the contestants of many strong works prompted us to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow to strengthen cooperation with third-party developers and stimulate the development of their projects outside of any competitions. <br><br>  Very soon on the World of Tanks portal in NA-, EU- and RU-regions we will update the section ‚ÄúUseful programs‚Äù, or Useful Software, and bring it to the Main one, which will give developers the most valuable thing - access to a wide audience. <br><br>  The section will become a kind of ‚ÄúChosen‚Äù project developed by the community.  Each of the six candidates listed above has excellent chances to get into this section on a permanent basis.  The community should know the most talented developers, and those who make projects deserve to be represented to the maximum number of players. <br><br><h4>  WGDC closing ceremony </h4><br>  Candidates who did not get into the prizes will have another surprise.  They, like the winners, will be sent invitations to the closing ceremony of the Wargaming Developers Contest, which will be held December 13-14 in Minsk. <br><br>  The plan of the event we will inform the guests as soon as possible.  On it, participants will be able to communicate with representatives of Wargaming, including - to ask sharp questions to the developers of the Wargaming Public API and get information from them about future development plans.  We will advise applicants in which direction to better develop their work.  All contestants will be able to share experiences with each other.  And, of course, those who did a great job during the competition will have the opportunity to relax and rest. <br><br>  Thanks to absolutely all the contestants for participating, and Habra audience for the attention to the competition.  Stay tuned for blog updates - it will be interesting! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/243027/">https://habr.com/ru/post/243027/</a></p>
