I think few people in the network do not know what the slang word troll means.  They are often found in the comments, come in Irish, not greeting, and leave in English, without saying goodbye.  Cause fierce hatred, the smell of valerian at the computer and broken keyboards.  For those who are still not familiar with them, I will give a definition. <br><blockquote>  Troll (boyars. Troublemakers) - an individual involved in trolling.  Initially, the so-called provocative message or action.  The purpose of the troll is the production of lulz for himself and the visitors, who saw through him, at the expense of less thoughtful visitors who spend time, strength and blood from his ass on srach with him. </blockquote><br>  The quote is taken from <a href="http://lurkmore.ru/%25D0%25A2%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C">Lurkmor</a> , I advise you to <a href="http://lurkmore.ru/%25D0%25A2%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C">finish</a> it by the way.  Why did I talk about trolls?  And all because recently I very often come across IT trolls.  Good or bad, and what to do with this is discussed below. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, one of my tasks in my work is the work of the Scrum master.  What does it mean?  This means that I often try to intervene in the process and reveal the background, and why we have it this way and not otherwise.  At one of those moments, I was sent to such a cute <a href="http://xn-----clcksaplxf6byd3cyb.xn--p1ai/">site</a> .  By the way, the translation on the website fails, so I seriously did not immediately take it, but the bell rang. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="man" src="http://--./motherfucker.png" width="241" height="140"></div><br><br>  Another call was a discussion of the situation when one of our programmers was pulled at the old project, where he silently confiscated the bug without telling anyone what the essence of its module was.  To my question - ‚ÄúGuys, why didn‚Äôt you try to program in pairs or at least make a mouth-watering introduction to this block?‚Äù To this, I received a well, very strange answer in my opinion: ‚ÄúWe are writing excellent and understandable code, so they will understand without our explanations and any confluence.  In that team, the release is coming soon, and we are paid not for quality, but for speed. ‚Äù <br><br>  Here is a pair of trolling cases, which I consider negative, demotivating and non-constructive.

We read the same scrum training for one of our divisions with one of the leads, after which one of the funniest teams rewarded me with the call sign ‚ÄúOh great scrum master‚Äù =) These are working moments, no one is offended, and my mood improves.  And these teams also have skepticism on the topic of scram, but this skepticism is healthy, not to say that the processes do not work, but to understand why they do not work.  And this trolling is necessary and useful, because it forces you to strain your head and look for both a solution to the problem and ways of conducting a discussion. <br><br>  A separate ‚Äúwonderful‚Äù trolling, which many can see, is the debate between testers and programmers.  Here I will not say anything, just advise you to read this <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/testing/124674/">post</a> and comments to it and make sure with your own eyes.  By the way, thanks to Slava Pankratov and Sasha Orlov, I wrote this post.  But not because they are trolls (many here can argue), but because in their <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/stratoplan/%3Fap%3D1">group on Facebook</a> I came across a couple of great links: <a href="http://www.developers.org.ua/columns/slava-pankratov/">one</a> and <a href="http://cotoha.info/thoughts/dark-side-of-being-a-trainer/">two</a> . <br><br>  Briefly about what's inside the links.  Inside there is an ohaha by programmers koach.  Say coats such rascals who poor us laborers earn their big money, while what should we do?  Right <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="man" src="http://--./motherfucker.png"></div><br><br>  And what types of trolling programmers have you seen? <br><br>  Yes, by the way, I am also a programmer and I also like to play around;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125168/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125168/</a></p>
