      <b>---</b> <br>  Does Eset, the developer of the famous <b>NOD32</b> antivirus and the <b>Smart Security</b> complex, need to be introduced, which, in addition to NOD32, includes the Firewall and Antispam modules?  Probably not, because literally in June, the data released by United Consultants research was published, according to which the NOD32 and Eset brands are familiar to <b>450 million people</b> all over the planet.  There is no doubt that computer users and guests of the portal are among them.  According to Eset, its products account for <b>8.9% of the</b> global market for antivirus solutions for home users, making it one of the TOP5 developers of relevant software.  Moreover, among the so-called advanced users, again according to the company, <b>19%</b> use Eset products.  And this is also very, very good for a relatively small private company that started its business when socialism ended in Europe. <br>  <b>---</b> <br>  The company's history began in <b>1987</b> , when Peter Pasko (Peter Pasko) and Miroslav Trnka (Miroslav Trnka) wrote the first version of the antivirus NOD.  This was not done for money's sake: the first viruses were already pretty annoying even then, and two Slovak enthusiasts decided to fight them.  The result of the works did not even sell, but simply distributed to friends and acquaintances.  I liked the product, and already in the <b>90th</b> year the first sale took place - to Austria, under the name <b>STOPVIR</b> .  And in <b>1992</b> , the developers together with Rudulf Hruby registered the company Eset.  Since then, the number of co-owners has increased significantly - due to the acquisition of talented programmers Richard Marko and Maros Grund, as well as the organizer of the American "daughter" Anton Zajac.  But the company still remains private, not yielding to the temptation of <b>an IPO</b> .  At first glance, to be honest, you can‚Äôt guess that you are the co-owner of such a serious company and the chairman of the board of directors.  Rather, Peter recalls a programmer from a Soviet research institute - a high forehead, glasses at the end of the nose, a dark jacket ... And this characteristic look. <br>  <b>---</b> <br>  The door at the exit of the office Eset is equipped with such a tricky lock.  It is not enough to bring an employee card to him, it is necessary to indicate the reason why you leave your workplace.  I am not strong in Slovak, but Google‚Äôs online translator suggested that <b>Dovolenka</b> means ‚Äú <i>holiday</i> ‚Äù, and <b>Lekar</b> , <b>Choroba</b> , <b>Obed</b> and <b>Slujobne</b> sound quite Russian.  Personally, I was most hooked on the point <b>Vol'no</b> , which, according to Google, means ... " <i>for free</i> ."  Is it possible to deduct a certain amount from pressing the remaining buttons? <br>  <b>---</b> <br>  Here the employee Eset dissects a new virus.  According to reliable data, the company receives up to <b>100,000</b> (!) Daily reports of newborns, many of which, of course, turn out to be false.  But, frankly speaking, it doesn‚Äôt really fit in my head - how can you digest such a flow of information, even if you quit all <b>200</b> employees for this task?  Perhaps this is the topic for the next article. <br>  <b>---</b> <br>  Our editorial team is a group fan of the film <b>Eurotrip</b> , whose heroes swept across Europe, and stopped in Bratislava.  We learned from the film that the song ‚Äú <b>Holy War</b> ‚Äù sounds everywhere in the city, cannibal dogs run over it, and for a dollar of eighty-three cents you can buy half of the country.  Therefore, I took this amount with me on the trip, after having exchanged the paper dollar into small coins.  Big mistake! <br>  PS The editors are indignant at the waiter at the <b>UFO</b> Bratislava restaurant, who was unhappy with tips in the amount of as much as five US cents.  In the film <b>Eurotrip,</b> his colleague on this money opened his hotel. <br>  <b>---</b> <br><br>  ps All rights reserved.  Peace, friendship and train <s>at</s> Vacka, as they say. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/63326/">https://habr.com/ru/post/63326/</a></p>
