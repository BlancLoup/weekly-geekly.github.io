      In the afternoon I went to the precinct.  He was not there.  I think figs with him.  I went to the district police department (in this case, the police department "Savinovo").  They waited about 5 minutes while the duty officer would take me, after which he told what had happened and said that I wanted to write a statement about the theft.  The duty officer exchanged glances with his partner, who I suppose was playing computer solitaire, both ‚Äúscratched the turnip‚Äù and said: ‚ÄúYou need to go to the‚Äú department K ‚Äù, which deals with high-tech crimes.  This is on Dzherzhinsky 1 ".  Thank.  Went there. <br><br>  I searched this department for about 30 minutes (there are no signs anywhere. It's good that one of the employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Tajikistan, who said exactly where to go, got caught).  It turned out that the district police department made a very decent address.  ‚ÄúDepartment K‚Äù is located in Kazan at Dzerzhinsky 19 (building of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Tajikistan).  Then I waited about 15 minutes at the checkpoint.  A man came down and started asking me about everything.  His words, almost literally: <br>  - ‚ÄúDepartment K‚Äù does not collect and review allegations of money theft on the Internet.  You must contact the district police department at your place of residence and write a statement about the theft of money from your electronic account.  Then they decide whether to initiate a criminal case on the application.  They can contact us for the entire technical side of the case and we will definitely help them.  Given that the amount you have is not small (9470.76 Ru, to be exact. Approx. Author), then they can not refuse to initiate proceedings. <br>  - What documents do I need to bring with me? <br>  - Well, of course, a passport and screenshots in which will be shown where the money went with the transaction codes + history of visits to your wallet. <br><br>  At the same meeting, they gave me a phone number and advised me to find out everything that is not clear on the phone.  I called and told me a list of what I needed to do: <br><ol><li>  It is necessary to write a statement about the theft to the district Office of Internal Affairs (ATC) (at your place of residence) addressed to the head of this district ATC. </li><li>  Attach a ‚Äúexplanation‚Äù to the application in which you need to clearly state when the wallet was created, for what purposes it was used, when money arrived, when money left.  Indicate who contacted for a refund.  Have anyone given passwords from the wallet? </li><li>  Attach a screenshot with the history of visits, as well as screenshots with details of all unauthorized transfers.  <em>As I was told, screenshots should not be certified by a notary</em> . </li></ol><br><br>  With this bundle of documents (in my case it‚Äôs 7 sheets + copies), go to the district police department and hand them over.  Must accept the application and all related papers and issue a KUSP ticket. <br><br>  And then it remains to wait.  Statements will go tomorrow.  Tomorrow I will lay out all the papers that I will give them (if they still accept and do not send them back to the ‚ÄúDepartment K‚Äù). <br><br>  <i>And the information from Yandex (for those who missed) how can you find yourself in the history of entering Yandex. Wallet ip-address 127.0.0.1 using <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/yandex/74263/">my case</a> as an example:</i> <br><blockquote>  In this case, the intruder‚Äôs ip call was incorrectly displayed in your call history.  When logging in via an anonymous proxy server, the address shown in the haul history is taken from the Forwarded-for header.  The script that determines the incoming ip address was redirected to itself and therefore determined its address.  However, we keep information about all IP addresses from which payments are made (of course, in the case of a proxy, this will be the proxy address).  Upon request from the police, we will provide this information.  The proxy server itself also stores information about the addresses from which calls were made to it, and the police can also receive this information. </blockquote><br><br>  <em>PS I was very surprised by the attitude of the employees of the ‚ÄúDepartment K‚Äù towards me and my case - they listened to everything, explained everything.</em>  <em>Honestly, I did not expect.</em>  <em>I thought that I would be sent for a long time and far away, just not to do my work.</em>  <em>Thank you for this attitude to ordinary citizens.</em>  <em>Everywhere would be so ...</em> <br><br>  <b>And another tip from Yandex: use strong authorization.</b>  <em>(then a similar situation will not happen to you. author‚Äôs comment)</em> <br><br>  <b>The next part of the story is here: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/yandex/74448/">How to take my money from the Yandex wallet.</a></b>  <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/yandex/74448/">Part 2.2.</a></b>  <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/yandex/74448/">Statement</a></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/74374/">https://habr.com/ru/post/74374/</a></p>
