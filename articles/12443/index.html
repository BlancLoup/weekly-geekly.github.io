  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to format the brain for the installation of another language?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Almost every programmer in his life tried to install on his computer a fundamentally different operating system, and knows perfectly the sequence of actions to achieve this goal: <br><ol><li>  Understand the need for this process.  Motivation can create or urgent need - hitting inspection bodies, or keen interest - to try what it is. </li><li>  Buy or borrow the distribution of the installed system. </li><li>  Find a good manual for working with the new system and, most importantly, a manual for installing it. </li><li>  Create a new partition on the hard drive and format it in the format required for the new operating system. </li><li>  Install the operating system in this section according to the manual. </li><li>  Install the necessary programs, use and enjoy :) </li></ol><br>  For our brain, an analogue of the operating system is the language in which we communicate and reason, so it is logical to continue the analogy and consider the procedure for learning a foreign language in terms of its optimization. <a name="habracut"></a><br><ol><li>  To realize the need to learn a language - without urgent need or or keen interest, the idea will clearly be hopeless. </li><li>  There are no problems with the ‚Äúdistributions‚Äù for a long time - a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãdiverse textbooks from both native speakers and domestic spills flooded the market, creating difficulties only with the difficulty of choosing from a huge assortment. </li><li>  But with the "manual" more difficult - good books on the use of language can be counted on the fingers, modern effective methods of studying grammar are strictly classified, and selling classic as far as overcomplicated by incomprehensible terminology and little-used structures that are more enemies than helpers.  The particular trouble with the ‚Äúinstallation manuals‚Äù is that I don‚Äôt know a single textbook where in detail and clearly it was stated not what to teach, but HOW to teach (abstruse and abstract textbooks on methods of teaching foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãshould not be taken into account, they are written for teachers and understand them only. And where is the methodology for students?) </li><li>  Scientists have long proven that people who have studied another language in adulthood have a <a title="Separate language centers" href="http://filolingvia.com/publ/7-1-0-594">separate language center for each language</a> in the brain.  However, philologists - linguists pay little attention to this, and warnings of some advanced colleagues (mostly those who have passed from the technical sphere), what to learn words, phrases, etc., without putting pronunciation, i.e.  without formatting a bundle of brain-speech muscles for another use, it is completely useless, they do not react.  (It is possible that partly because of the fear to realize their own problems in this regard) </li><li>  The full troubles occur when trying to ‚Äúinstall an operating system‚Äù - try to apply one of the many <a title="Methods and methods of learning foreign languages" href="http://filolingvia.com/index/0-10">methods of learning foreign languages</a> .  The absurdity and irrationality of most of them are particularly clearly revealed in computer-software comparison: </li><li>  In the field of ‚Äúuse of programs‚Äù, i.e.  language practice, the majority of teachers also have a very interesting approach - they consider decompiling and porting to another operating system most useful for mastering the programs, i.e.  applied to the study of language - the translation of texts from one language to another.  Any programmer can add his own opinion about the effectiveness of this training method for a novice user :) </li></ol><br>  What is most curious, the most successful in speeding up and intensifying the process of learning foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãwere not just linguists, but people with technical education.  And although their books, websites, methods, tips stubbornly keep silent about (since logical criticism is impossible, except to dust the brain with all sorts of abstruse terms), common sense is slowly beginning to take its own, and this information is spreading wider and wider. <br>  Quite remarkable is also the fact that many of these authors, completely unaware and not reading the books of others, rediscover the same thing over and over again, building their plan according to the same logical system described above.  The most recent example is the book by N. Zamyatkin " <a href="http://filolingvia.com/publ/180-1-0-680">YOU CANNOT LEARN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE</a> ".  The author has extensive practical experience in teaching both English and Russian as a foreign language in the United States, and his book on HOW to properly learn a foreign language can be considered a classic of the genre.  In short, his ideas can be put in the same scheme: <br><ol><li>  Motivation </li><li>  Making a distribution kit based on audio courses, leaving only the words of a foreign announcer </li><li>  Using a good tutorial is quite helpful, but at a later stage </li><li>  we format a bundle of brain-speech muscles by repeated listening and loud repetition of the most popular foreign phrases (without setting the task to memorize or learn something!) </li><li>  We install a ‚Äúlanguage matrix‚Äù -operation, recognizing the meaning and meaning of repeated phrases and constructing new combinations from them </li><li>  We put vocabulary and grammar not by cramming words and rules, but by reading books and watching movies, listening to podcasts with minimal use of dictionaries.  Enjoy and enjoy :) </li></ol></div>
