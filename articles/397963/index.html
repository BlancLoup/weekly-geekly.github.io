Artificial intelligence, AI), deep machine learning technologies and high-performance analytical services and applications.  In total, there are three types of Linux systems that conform to the OpenPOWER standard.  All announced servers are part of the PowerSystemsLC line. <br><br>  In many cases, these servers show a higher level of performance than the X86 server.  Our servers can significantly increase the efficiency of data centers.  Many partners took part in creation of these servers - the large technology companies and startups.  Almost all partners are members of the Open POWER Foundation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The explosive growth of big data ‚Äî more than 2.5 quintillas of data generated by devices every day ‚Äî sets organizations in the task of building powerful technological infrastructures to extract valuable information from these arrays.  Commonly used general-purpose servers are based on closed processor technology, and are often used at the limit of their capacity due to the workload associated with processing big data, as well as cloud and mobile computing.

      IBM, in turn, presents a new approach to data processing systems, which brings together the consortium of the Open POWER Foundation.  Launched at the end of 2013, the consortium is developing rapidly, and today includes several dozen companies working to expand the capabilities of the IBM POWER processor to develop innovation in the industry. <br><br>  One of the models, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/marketplace/cloud/commercial-computing/us/en-us">IBM Power System S822LC</a> , is based on the IBM Power 8 processor. This processor supports the Nvidia NV Link interface, which provides a direct connection between the Nvidia Tesla P100 CPU and GPU.  The result of this support is a fivefold increase in the speed of data exchange compared to x86-compatible systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e05/72c/39a/e0572c39a759430687a4a252029a46b1.jpg"><br><br>  NV Link is a high-performance computer bus using a point-to-point connection, differential signals with a built-in clock signal and channels called ‚Äúblocks‚Äù, each with 8 pairs at a speed of 20 Gbit / s.  Thus, each unit provides the ability to transfer approximately 20 gigabytes per second. <br><br>  The Power System S821LC and IBM Power System S822LC for Big Data server models use a PCIe bus to work with GPUs.  To increase the speed of information processing, the POWER Accel Coherent Acceleration Processor Interface (CAPI) interface is used here.  This interface is designed for high-speed connectivity of FPGA accelerators. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe open model of doing business and our approach within OpenPOWER allows us to replace technology suppliers who offer proprietary private solutions created within the walls of a single company,‚Äù comments Doug Balog, CEO of Power Systems, IBM Systems &amp; Technology Group, ‚ÄúThe new technology will provide customers with a greater choice and help them get valuable information as quickly as possible for the subsequent solution of business problems.‚Äù <br><br>  The servers were tested jointly with Tencent.  This is one of the world's largest providers of Internet services.  For a number of server tasks, the Power Systems LC line showed better results than servers on x86 processors.  Thus, in some cases, you can use fewer Power Systems LC servers than X86 servers.  New systems can be used in the development of a weak form of AI, to create a software platform of romo mobiles, with real-time protection against hacking or the development of new types of medical products by pharmaceutical companies.  At the same time, a number of IBM solutions cost 30% less than comparable x86 solutions.  And the Power System S822LC for BigData system shows 80% higher performance than solutions based on 2-socket x86 E5-2600v4 (Broadwell). <br><br>  ¬ªFor more information on IBM PowerSystems, <a href="http://www.ibm.com/systems/power/announcement.html">please click here.</a> <br>  ¬ªFor more information about OpenPOWERFoundation, <a href="http://www.openpowerfoundation.org/">please click here.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397963/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397963/</a></p>
