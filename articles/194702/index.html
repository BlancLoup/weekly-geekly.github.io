  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Android vs iOS on the example of one game</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello!  My name is Pavel and I am <s>an</s> indie <s>developer</s> . <br>  I often read various kinds of analytics, there are a lot of graphs about how many android devices are currently activated, how many iOS are, how markets are growing and shares are falling.  Unfortunately, percentages and abstract numbers rarely allow you to understand exactly what is actually going on inside. <br>  Most likely, I‚Äôm not the only one with this problem, so I decided to share the ‚Äúlive‚Äù statistics of one of my games, which has become quite popular on iOS and Android.  At once I will make a reservation that the speech about the game is exclusively in Russian, only Russian-speaking users play accordingly.  For those who have a target for Europe, the USA, etc.  post may be uninformative. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In March 2013, I posted the ‚ÄúMake a Word‚Äù game on Google Play.  She did not offer any unprecedented gameplay.  There were already 3 such in Russian (and now there are even more).  Nevertheless, thanks to some features, ongoing support and weekly updates, the game was able to become relatively popular.  It was not possible to take the first place even in its category, the case was limited to the fifth place in the Puzzles. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/109/503/290/109503290c65a0a1f960805317b2d42f.png" alt="image"><br>  For a long time I released games only on Android, despite the fact that the framework was originally cross-platform and spreading games in parallel and in the Appstore is not so difficult.  It was also a matter of prejudice against iOS, and in the absence of Mac (coupled with the reluctance to spend money on it (and the virtual machine could not run properly on an AMD processor)).  But at some point I overcame the ‚Äútoad‚Äù, waited for more or less adequate ads on Avito and bought a mac on the secondary market.  So, almost four months later, in July 2013, the Make up a Word version appeared in the Appstore.  The games were absolutely identical, except for Android, I continued to issue weekly updates with new content, and on iOS for all the time I limited myself to one.  This was not my first application for iOS, I already managed to feel two failures, despite the fact that on Google Play one of the games was quite popular.  But ‚ÄúCompose Words‚Äù could ‚Äúfly up‚Äù in the top, simultaneously pulling out my other game from the bottom, which itself could not shoot on iOS. <br>  Well, now the numbers.  We will compare the statistics for 2 months.  Those.  for Google Play 03/15/2013 - 05/15/2013, and for the Appstore 11.07.2013-11.09.2013 <br>  In the first table, the best <b>places in the top</b> and places 60 days after launch in certain categories. <br><table border="2" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1"><tbody><tr><td>  OS </td><td>  <b>Android</b> </td><td>  <b>iOS</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  Top <b>Puzzles</b> </td><td>  five </td><td>  <b>one</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Puzzle</b> after 60 days </td><td>  <i>12</i> </td><td>  <i>12</i> </td></tr><tr><td>  Top <b>Games</b> </td><td>  22 </td><td>  <b>one</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  Top <b>Games</b> after 60 days </td><td>  <b>46</b> </td><td>  50 </td></tr><tr><td>  Top <b>Applications</b> </td><td>  36 </td><td>  <b>3</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  Top <b>Apps</b> after 60 days </td><td>  <b>76</b> </td><td>  168 </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  And a couple of graphs: <br>  Android <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/afa/fe0/32a/afafe032ade855ea9a59202c440ff4b2.png" alt="make words"><br>  iOS <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/417/28f/50b/41728f50bc0a8eb32c51ff1a75b4e467.png" alt="make words"><br><br>  <i>As can be seen from the tables, in iOS, the game was able to climb to the very top, but as time passed, it turned out to be still on Google Play.</i>  <i>Perhaps the reason is more frequent updates of the Android version, and maybe the fact that on iOS it is much easier to push through the application to the top, so staying there on the top lines is much more difficult.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>It's also worth saying that games on iOS can live in two thematic tops at once.</i>  <i>The second is ‚ÄúCompose Words‚Äù - Word games.</i>  <i>There, the position is quite high so far - it fluctuates between the first and third place.</i>  <i>But they pump a little from there, this is a low-popular hub.</i>

I have to start paying more attention to iOS.  Despite the fact that as a percentage of the share of iOS falls, the total number of users continues to grow.  And the developer needs something there :) And I‚Äôm not talking about the many problems that Android users have (the game doesn‚Äôt load from Google Play, it doesn‚Äôt update, it crashes, it hangs, etc.).  Every day I receive from 2 to 20 letters with problems from Android users and for all the time that I publish games for iOS, I received three letters from players from this system.  Those.  there is also much more time spent on support (and you don‚Äôt just have to answer, but also find a reason, a solution often unrelated to my application). <br>  At the same time, I myself continue to use my Galaxy S I9000 three years ago and do not plan to leave Android. <br>  I hope that this article will help someone in choosing the right vector of development in the mobile market. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/194702/">https://habr.com/ru/post/194702/</a></p>
