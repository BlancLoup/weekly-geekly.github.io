Sberbank employees themselves say that everything is legal and logical.  So, the story about the experience of using the services of Sberbank: <br><br>  I opened a Sberbank account on a book and a plastic card.  The fixed capital lies on the book and sometimes I use the Sberbank online system to transfer my money from one book to a card, and usually this procedure took about 2 hours, to which I was ‚Äúextremely happy‚Äù. <br><br>  One day I decided to go to another city for the holidays and I needed an amount of 20 thousand rubles.  There was no branch, it was evening, I was leaving early the next day, so I used the Sberbank online service.

      Next quest <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I transferred the money and calmly went to bed.  In the morning there was no money on the card, I did not receive any notification via SMS.  But there was an email at the post office saying that the operation was canceled.  For whatever reason - it is not said, nor was there any other information in this letter. <br><br>  I decided to postpone the trip and go to Sberbank in the morning immediately to the opening.  Came, talked heart to heart with managers.  He described his situation that I was leaving and that I needed money here and now.  I was assured that this was some kind of misunderstanding and that money could be transferred to a card right now and without a queue.  Well, yes b * d with them, think linger on for 4 hours.  The money was transferred and I went to the gas station with a clear conscience, and then I intended to leave the city.  When paying for gas, it turned out that there is still no money on the card.  I called Sberbank‚Äôs support, and there I‚Äôm kindly told that it can take two days to transfer money! <br><br>  The mood in the morning was already ruined, I was tearing off the gas station back to Sberbank (well, gasoline was still in the tank), I go all the soap into the compartment and publicly indignant.  It turned out that they did not understand the fact that I needed the money right now, and if it was so, be so kind as to get the money in cash.  And the initial amount I transferred in the morning was stuck in the astral, i.e.  it is no longer on the book, and not yet on the card.  There is no other way out, you have to withdraw this amount again.  In a word, the money for the card came only the next day (well still on the book remained the necessary amount of money, and if not?).  And this is despite the fact that both the card and the savings book were opened in one branch of the bank.  Here they are, electronic technology. <br><br>  I decided to write the same post because of other situations that occurred a few hours ago and overflowed with patience. <br><br>  Passed by Sberbank and decided to jump in, pay for utilities, namely to pay for the use of natural gas.  Stopping in line, it turned out that these services are now paid only through the terminal.  We were pleased ... I went to the terminal, entered the personal account, the date and saw the amount taken from the ceiling (2 thousand more than I calculated).  By the way, I have a counter and I cannot find out how much I owe them, but it‚Äôs impossible to change this amount displayed on the terminal.  I learned the address of the nearest branch, where you can pay for natural gas through a cashier.  I went there, again stood in the queue, but this time I paid for it, and lost almost all the cash. <br><br>  A few hours later I had to run to the radio equipment store, where there is no terminal.  To pay for the order did not have 50 rubles.  I decided to look for an ATM in the area and literally 10 meters from the store I found an ATM of another bank.  Knowing that the information on the interest charged should now be displayed on the ATM screen, I decided to withdraw 100 rubles with a clear conscience (there was an inscription of 0% on the ATM), paid for the purchase and received an SMS from Sberbank in the car.  It said that I withdrew 100 rubles, and the commission amounted to 120 rubles!  Think of a penny, but the fact that I‚Äôve been deceived, even if it‚Äôs 120 rubles, is present. <br><br>  I called the bank support, at whose ATM I took 100 p.  They assure me that they do not charge any commission, please contact your bank.  I called Sberbank - it‚Äôs quite easy for me to inform me that the minimum commission when withdrawing cash at other ATMs is 100 rubles, even if I‚Äôll take 10 or 50 rubles there.  Those.  blame - the client, I mean.  Last year, when I was withdrawing money from other ATMs, there was no such commission.  He started the card two years ago, and not a word is said in the agreement on a commission of at least 100 rubles. <br><br>  This is how the most omnipresent bank in Russia works. <br><br>  PS And I do not understand the point of paying a commission when paying fines DPS.  After all, it is really cheaper and easier for the inspector to give money personally ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116813/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116813/</a></p>
