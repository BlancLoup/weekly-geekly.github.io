  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Data Center in Russia as a need for the development of high-tech industry</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Poyuzal search, I did not find a similar topic, only in context in different topics :) <br><br>  In general, I am interested in the development of data centers (data centers) in Russia.  At present, this industry is developing more or less only in Moscow and St. Petersburg, while the rest of the cities remain overboard.  But in the capitals, not everything is as good as we would like.  Obsolete technologies are used in construction, equipment is often proposed to be placed almost in hangars with simple (domestic) air conditioning, there are no normal and digestible standards for building data centers, I do not consider TIER as such because they are not invented by us, so they describe some kind of laboratory conditions, generally unattainable in the harsh realities of our world. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I am a representative of the Slavyansky data center - the first commercial data center built in Russia using modern technologies, using advanced developments of European and Russian engineers.

      Today, progress seeks to maximize business costs, respectively.  Many companies invest in a computer component, in communications and other IT solutions, often a banal office-warehouse combination can either work perfectly and without problems, and sometimes be a universal problem if the IT infrastructure is not established and not properly configured.  The pace of modern life makes it faster and more accurate to organize the work of companies, what actually is the main idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãIT technologies - to simplify the life of the company.  Modern software applications require all large hardware resources, communication channels which were discussed 5 years ago already very good.  narrow because  IP telephony, data exchange, external data warehouses are developing, large corporations are implementing SAP and other integrator solutions. <br><br>  As a result of all this, technologies ensuring uninterrupted and stable operation of these systems are also developing by leaps and bounds, today you can very often hear such words as blade baskets, twin servers, disk arrays, etc., all of these words denote powerful server hardware, which in able to perform tasks that were not available 2 years ago, but everyone forgot that sometimes it is almost impossible to place such equipment.  In Russia and Moscow in particular, a rather large selection of Data Centers is, some are better, others are worse, but at the same time the capabilities of these data centers are rather limited in terms of energy and heat dissipation. <br><br>  I once called the Data Centers a long time ago with the simplest question: ‚ÄúCan you place a rack with 3 blabe baskets?‚Äù The answer usually touched))), ‚ÄúYes, no problem, rent 2-3 racks and place your baskets‚Äù, everything is trite and simple, Data Center built on obsolete technologies is not able to divert the amount of heat that this equipment emits, respectively, it is necessary to carry the equipment to different cabinets so that it does not overheat.  What to do if for example a large hosting company that hosts equipment, for example, in 100 racks, but at the same time, the racks are 50-60% full (physically), and if this equipment is assembled into high-density cabinets?  Costs decrease or increase?  How do you think?))) <br><br>  The standard offer on the market is 5 kW per rack, well, a maximum of 8 kW, sorry, of course, but these are only 15-20 powerful 1U servers, and what about the other 20U that are empty in the rack, and you have to pay for them <br>  Such a situation on the Data Centers market leads to the fact that hosting companies and integrator companies become dependent on little powerful equipment, which increases the number of equipment, speed and quality of its work.  Many companies are trying to place the server in their office, naively believing that there they will be safe, but they forget about all the advantages of data centers. <br><br>  <i>I ran into such a case once, a client calls, complains that on weekends neither the Internet, nor telephony, nor the server, nothing.</i>  <i>Like why they did it so badly, they started to figure it out and found out that the owner of the office on weekends stupidly cut off electricity in "non-residential" premises, from savings)))), with proper infrastructure construction this would have been impossible.</i> <br><br>  I consider the main problems of data centers in Russia are the backwardness of heat removal technologies, the high cost of construction due to the lack of knowledge of the equipment market and the lack of competent engineers.  Catastrophic power failure. <br><br>  If the first problems are solved, then the energy problem is not solved at the level of telecom operators, hosting companies and companies owning Data Centers.  The problem is the level of government. <br><br>  To date, there is no certification body in Russia that could clearly articulate the requirements for Data Centers and certify the activities of this industry, respectively.  Any room in which you can put equipment can call yourself a data center or data center. <br><br>  I propose to discuss this topic, the topic is relevant for all participants of the IT market. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66336/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66336/</a></p>
