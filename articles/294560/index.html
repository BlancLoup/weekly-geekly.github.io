  <section class="page js-page"><h1>In late September, a national online educational platform will open in Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  With the support of the Ministry of Education and Science, the Russian National Open Education <a href="https://openedu.ru/">Platform</a> , launched by leading universities of the country, officially launched in Moscow.  It is planned that in a few years a million students from Russia and other countries will be taking part in free online courses.  And their virtual grades will fall into real diplomas and resumes.  Now users will be able to get knowledge of a specific specialty in a few months, instead of studying a huge number of often unnecessary subjects for three to five years. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The most famous such online platform, <a href="https://ru.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> , was created in 2012 by lecturers at Stanford University.  In just a few years, the Coursera audience has grown to 11 million listeners, and about 120 universities, including Russian ones, cooperate with the portal. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOnline education and educational platforms are a real breakthrough.  We are confident that in the future the financial condition of a person, his social status, gender or place of residence will not prevent to get a quality education and come to success, ‚Äùargues the <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX</a> educational platform president Anant Agarwal.

      A few years ago, the French government sponsored the creation of the <a href="http://www.france-universite-numerique.fr/">FUN</a> portal with free courses of French universities, a similar <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/">Futurelearn</a> website in the <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/">UK</a> , and the national platform <a href="https://www.xuetangx.com/">XuetangX was</a> launched in China with strong government support.  By creating courses at the national level, the authorities want to demonstrate the quality of education in the country, attract foreign applicants, professors and, of course, investment. <br><br>  In Russia, eight leading Russian universities have created a national educational platform that have already had experience in developing online courses: MSU, NITU MISiS, HSE, MIPT, ITMO, UrFU, SPbSU and SPbPU.  Each university has invested at least 50 million rubles in the project and now has to provide at least ten courses from the best teachers for the year.  It is assumed that later, after careful selection, other universities will be able to join the project. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhen creating courses, we use a modern approach that successfully works on the best foreign sites.  Professor-creator of the course specifically for the "National Open Education Platform" reworked the usual one-hour lecture, adds multimedia materials (infographics, animation), developed with the help of web designers and programmers.  As a result, the listener receives a full-fledged course consisting of small lessons, literally 10‚Äì15 minutes each ‚Äù, says the rector of NUST MISIS Alevtina Chernikova to Kommersant. <br><br>  If necessary, various types of knowledge tests are introduced, trainings are conducted on simulators and in virtual laboratories.  In addition to the actual lectures, the listener of online courses can communicate on a special forum with other students.  Education on the national platform will be free - no USE or entrance exams are not provided.  So far, it has run 46 online training courses. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe founding universities have developed a special document that sets stringent criteria for the format and content of courses,‚Äù the authors of the platform say.  - In fact, the courses must comply with the state requirements for the content of a particular subject.  By the way, this is also a Russian innovation - courses of any level are abroad, they are far from always really high-quality.  Our principle: a student who has completed such a course should know and be able to do the same thing as a student who has studied it in the university lecturer. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúAt present, work is underway to create specialized centers for reliable verification of learning outcomes, the purpose of which is final certification of users.  After studying the online course, the learner will have the opportunity to choose: pass the exam to the professor who created the course or at a specialized center, ‚Äùsays the rector of NUST MISiS. <br><br>  The first classes on the platform will begin in late September, but you can sign up now.  ‚ÄúAccording to world statistics, 15‚Äì20% of MOOC students are applicants.  If earlier a significant part of schoolchildren chose a higher education institution on the advice of their parents or even just closer to home, now high school students want to make an informed choice.  And online courses help with this, show the strengths of the university, give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe program, ‚Äùthe authors of the platform believe. <br><br>  In our country there are already similar portals - <a href="http://universarium.org/">‚ÄúUniversarium‚Äù</a> , <a href="http://uniweb.ru/">UNIWEB</a> , <a href="http://arzamas.academy/courses">‚ÄúArzamas‚Äù</a> . <br><br>  Nevertheless, ‚Äúthe Russian market still remains empty - there are a large number of people in the country who can be interested in distance learning.  The space for work is enormous, ‚Äùsays Dmitry Guzhel, the founder of the‚Äú Universarium ‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOnline courses will never replace the traditional model of education, Anant Agarwal is sure.‚Äù But the introduction of such blended learning into the educational process will noticeably improve it.  Online courses will be able to free up more time for teachers and students for discussions, practical exercises, communication, joint solution of problems. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294560/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294560/</a></p>
