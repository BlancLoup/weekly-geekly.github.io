  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About what happened to ICQ today (part 1)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So, at the request of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/shoohurt/" class="user_link">Shoohurt, I am</a> telling everything that is known to us (the Miranda IM development team) at the moment about AOL tricks. <br><br>  Today, at about 13.00 Moscow time, almost all users of unofficial clients after entering the network and downloading the contact list received from the user with UIN 1 a message stating that the client version used is not used and unauthorized.  On the official website, right on the main page, a message appeared stating that only official versions of programs are now supported, which can be downloaded right here. <br><br>  Users who were already on the network did not feel any changes and were not disconnected from the server.  For those who tried to connect in the first hour and a half, it worked out with varying success: this is because the icq network is distributed and consists of many servers, and even after entering you can be transferred to another one, and judging by the changes applied to them take turns.

      Some technical details.  The login procedure is quite normal: the protocol is initialized, the capabilities are sent out, the server contact list and its own data are loaded.  Around this time, a message comes from number one, and after that it becomes impossible to receive anything from the server. <br><br>  Having decided that today the situation repeated on December 8, when customers stopped working due to the fact that during login they identified themselves as icq5.1 and earlier versions, we tried to identify ourselves as icq6.5 of the latest model.  It brought no results.  It became clear that this time AOL had gone through deep protection - apparently, now sent caps were taken into account (capabilities, information about protocol chips supported by the client).  Indeed, the substitution of their dialing for the one that uses icq6 helped, but only for the time of the first input - if you reconnect after that, it will not help.  Apparently, some changes have been made to the sequence of entry and initialization, the failure of which is considered an alternative by the client.  The QIP developers have suggested that the server needs some additional key, which can be either simply embedded into the client, or calculated on the basis of information received from the server.  They are also currently working hard on finding the cause of the client‚Äôs refusal. <br><br>  I hope in the next two days we will find the reason. <br><br>  In addition, I want to note an interesting fact - these changes affected only residents of the CIS countries.  When I contacted our developers from the Czech Republic and Germany, they were slightly at a loss - everything worked perfectly for them.  In addition, we were able to successfully connect to Miranda using an American proxy server, so there are suspicions that this is a targeted blocking of alternative messengers being developed in Russia. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Now the developer of QIP, INF, shared with me the idea that the whole thing is in the initial value of the sequence identifier used in the packets sent.  All unofficial clients generate them at random, and this may be the key.  The main problem is to find out the algorithm for its generation. <br><br>  Another small <b>UPD:</b> for clarity, you can compare screenshots of the site <a href="http://icq.com/">icq.com</a> , given to <a href="">Russian</a> and <a href="">American</a> visitors <br><br>  Discussion of what is happening is carried out in the gill, in icq_stop@conference.jabber.ru <br><br>  <b>UPD2:</b> According to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/shoohurt/" class="user_link">Shoohurt</a> , tomorrow, perhaps during the day there will be comments from the gentlemen who are directly related to the Russian version of ICQ (Rambler-ICQ).  Keep for updates. <br><br>  <b>UPD3:</b> Now we have found a correlation between the input time and the sequence number used, so there is a clue that some random number is still used for generation, but this version should be checked.  As it turned out, all old clients connect, even icq2003b, and TestBuddy 2002.  Plus, there are several reports that some providers in Omsk are working fine.  <b>In general, now the final conclusion is that the ‚ÄúAeciocals‚Äù have found a fundamental difference between the official client and all the clones, and they actively use it.</b> <br><br>  <b>It seems that the QIP development team has found a solution to the problem, working <a href="">QIP Infium 9022</a> builds are already available.</b> <br><br>  <b>As promised - the corrected version of the Miranda IM ICQ + plugin - <a href="">download</a></b> <br><br>  Gentlemen, I ask for patience.  Today I am exhausted and already more than a day without sleep.  Tomorrow I will lay out all the code and explain the essence of my decision.  It is rather trivial, and is based on the fact that the initial assumption about seq id is correct.  And in general it is slightly on props. <br><br><h4>  <b>Attention!</b>  <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/im/49877/">The story continues</a> :)</b> </h4></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/49778/">https://habr.com/ru/post/49778/</a></p>
