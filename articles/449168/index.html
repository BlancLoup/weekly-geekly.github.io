  <section class="page js-page"><h1>My experience preparing for the exam JIRA Administrator ACP-100</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Greetings <br><br>  In April 2018, I successfully passed the JIRA ACP-100 exam, in October 2018 I passed the ACP-200 confluence exam.  I decided to write a post about how I was preparing for the JIRA ACP-100 exam, to give advice for those who might be interested in this topic.  I will describe the process of my preparation for the exam.  This information does not guarantee the success of the exam and does not disclose the questions that will be on the exam.  But, I hope, it will be useful to many who wish to receive a certificate. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="400" height="400" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/927/e49/dfb/927e49dfb46f98949f56f7cc8c9cf044.png" alt="image"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first thing I want to draw attention to is the <b>language in which you will take the exam.</b>  My level of written English is A2 +, as you can see, this should be enough to understand the questions.  But nevertheless it is better to improve the knowledge of the language in which you will pass if it is not native to you.

      Exam description from atlas: <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/university/certification/certifications/exam-acp-100">ACP-100</a> . <br><br>  Do not be afraid if you have less experience, I had 1 year of experience at the time of the exam.  For the rest of the points you can prepare for the guides. <br><br>  You need to find yourself a <b>test JIRA</b> , a stand where you can do whatever you want without fear of breaking something.  Most likely you will take the exam in the interests of the company and therefore you can ask them to provide you with a test server or you can purchase a license for yourself - the issue price is $ 10.  Or use trail.  In any case, you need a stand where you will hone your skills.  It is not a good idea to use the PROM server with the allocation of a test project on it, because  You can break the PROM server. <br><br>  By the way, here is the first training case, try to migrate the PROM data to the test bench. <br><br>  Next, you need to try to run through all the possible settings JIRA.  To do this, I recommend to perform the process on the guide <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwareserver/jira-software-server-8-1-documentation-938845020.html">Administrator guide</a> . <br><br>  Read the section and make the settings on the test bench.  After a complete passage of all the points, you can try to answer the questions: Sample exam questions. <br><br>  I advise you to fix the result on all issues.  I got about 50% correct answers for the first time. <br><br>  Now you can <b>repeat the iteration to read the admin guide</b> and make settings with the addition of materials from the community.  With such iterations, I brought the sample tests to 100%.  IMPORTANT!  Do not try to learn the questions, it is necessary to understand why a particular answer is given to a particular question. <br><br>  At the same time, I drew the diagrams of the internal JIRA device for a better understanding of it.  If you put it all together, you get this scheme: <br><br><img src="https://community.atlassian.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/52155iAB033DDAE8E0846B/image-dimensions/2000?v=1.0&amp;px=-1" alt="image"><br><br>  It displays the links of settings that it seemed important to me to remember.  For example, the dotted line between the 'Issue security scheme' and 'issues' is the 'issue security level' you choose in the project task.  I memorized this scheme before the exam.  I will not describe the scheme in detail, because  it will be better for you if you <b>compose it in a new way</b> , just want to show a method. <br><br>  A good bonus on the exam is that you are given drafts and I used <b>mnemonic tricks</b> .  For example, to memorize what global rights are in JIRA, I jagged SABSFB (Sys adm, Adm, Browse, Shared, manage Filter, Bulk).  On the exam I wrote out all the rights to the draft.  With the mnemonic method, you only need to remember a few strange words, but then you have a reference book in front of your eyes and you are not afraid that you will forget something, which means you are less worried, less worried you are more likely to succeed. <br><br>  I suppose that's all I can write without violating the atlassian policy. <br><br>  Good luck. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/449168/">https://habr.com/ru/post/449168/</a></p>
