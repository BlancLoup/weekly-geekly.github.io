Moreover, different headsets gave preference to different devices. <br>  This review includes the most interesting at first glance devices that are quite common in electronics and cellular stores.  This review did not include headsets that do not represent anything - they are rare, they look mediocre, they sound like a fig, they sit uncomfortably on their heads.  Well, you understand :) First, they did not remember, and secondly, the temptation to buy them from you will not arise. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      1. <b>Jabra BT620s</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/50b/435/4c8/50b4354c8aa9b08fc28afae00595511a.jpg"><br>  <a href="">market.yandex.ru/model.xml?hid=418706&amp;modelid=939449</a> <br><br>  This is one of the first Bluetooth stereo headsets on the market, the first one I tried, and it‚Äôs the culprit that I doubted being able to listen to music through a stereo bluetooth headset without a shudder. <br><br>  The quality of music on both devices sucks.  It is impossible to listen.  The worst headset in this test. <br><br>  2. <b>Sony-Ericsson HBH-DS970</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4a0/900/276/4a09002762ade95f387a47e009577aee.jpg"><br>  <a href="">market.yandex.ru/model.xml?hid=418706&amp;modelid=948789</a> <br><br>  The quality of music on the HTC P3300 is good, the quality of music on the Samsung Q1 Ultra sucks. <br>  Of the benefits is the ability to work simultaneously as hands-free with a communicator and a stereo headset with a UMPC. <br>  When a call comes in, the music is paused and you can answer the call. <br>  When used in conjunction with Skype on Q1, the name of the person calling you on Skype is displayed on the screen of the headset. <br>  The wiper can be used when it is connected to a charger. <br>  Also, this headset showed very good sound quality on a Sony VAIO laptop. <br>  Among the shortcomings: extremely small time in the music playback mode.  Something about 3 hours, and the charging indicator does not reflect the actual battery charge.  Without music, you can stay completely suddenly. <br><br>  3. <b>Motorola HT820</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/18b/6a4/64b/18b6a464b05815fa7ab8a33522711254.jpg"><br>  <a href="">market.yandex.ru/model.xml?hid=418706&amp;modelid=939688</a> <br><br>  The quality of music on the HTC P3300 is very mediocre, on the Samsung Q1 Ultra - quite good. <br>  Advantages - amazing time of work from a single charge.  Enough for several days with prolonged use to listen to music. <br>  Disadvantages - rather massive construction, looks a bit strange on the head. <br><br>  4. <b>Sony DR-BT50</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2ec/7b7/264/2ec7b72648b8dd8163b53d3ed6c2d329.jpg"><br>  <a href="">market.yandex.ru/model.xml?hid=418706&amp;modelid=1628392</a> <br><br>  The most pretentious participant in testing.  Just look at the appearance and price. <br><br>  The quality of music on the HTC P3300 - sucks.  Can compete with party number 1. Samsung Q1 Ultra could not be tested.  Wait for updates in the near future. <br>  Advantages - an incredibly stylish design, quality of workmanship and materials.  Sit comfortably on the head. <br>  Disadvantages - the disgusting quality of the outgoing sound when used as hands-free telephony. <br>  I sincerely regret that these shortcomings, coupled with the disgusting stereo sound, put an end to this headset.  In terms of performance and ergonomics, it is the best that I had to hold in my hands. <br><br>  5. <b>Jabra BT8010</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6dd/e84/060/6dde84060dfef890aa1afcee16ad203a.jpg"><br>  <a href="">market.yandex.ru/model.xml?hid=418706&amp;modelid=1001728</a> <br><br>  Very unusual model.  My acquaintance with her was very superficial. <br>  The sound quality is good on both devices, a unique form factor, an incredible amount of settings on the headset itself using the buttons and the built-in LCD screen. <br>  The question remains the possibility of simultaneous work with two devices. <br>  I did not dare to buy it because of a too unusual form factor. <br>  If it is of interest to you, read the reviews and try, because  sound quality makes it take into account when choosing. <br><br>  6. <b>Sony DR-BT21G</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/024/036/28e/02403628e62d614f8b115c907e38458b.jpg"><br>  <a href="">market.yandex.ru/model.xml?hid=418706&amp;modelid=1628390</a> <br><br>  The quality of music on the HTC P3300 is satisfactory, the Samsung Q1 Ultra is very good, the best of what I heard is difficult to distinguish from wired headphones. <br>  Advantages - the quality of workmanship and materials as well as the design evoke exclusively positive emotions.  Conveniently sits on the head, conveniently folds for transport.  The range is amazing - enough for movement throughout the two-room apartment, with it, even reinforced concrete walls are not an obstacle. <br>  The operating time in playback mode is about 10 hours, lasting for several days. <br>  It is possible to work simultaneously with two devices. <br>  The sensitivity of the microphone is satisfactory, it can be used for telephone conversations and Skype. <br>  Among the shortcomings, we can only mention the impossibility of working with the charger connected, but with such battery life it is not a big disadvantage. <br><br>  This headset has an analogue - <br><br>  <b>Sony DR-BT22IK</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e10/92c/87c/e1092c87c0a4f3106d3d9ac6db0ccf08.jpg"><br>  <a href="">market.yandex.ru/model.xml?hid=418706&amp;modelid=1628391</a> <br><br>  They differ, apparently, only the execution of the headband, which is also a definite plus for both of these models.  You can choose what the cushion is without sacrificing sound quality.  Also, mods will be glad that these headsets have a version in white glossy plastic. <br><br>  <b>How can and how not to extrapolate the results</b> <br>  We can surely expect the same results with HTC devices on the same platform as the P3300: tachi, lov, etc.  The same results as the Q1 Ultra will show x86 compatible laptops and tablets with bluetooth 2.0 controllers and a broadcom / widcomm stack. <br>  One cannot expect a headset with a ‚Äúsucks‚Äù or ‚Äúvery good‚Äù rating to be one with all existing devices.  As this blitz test showed, with different devices the same headset can show absolutely different stereo quality. <br>  Regarding HTC, you should not project the results on the HTC Max 4G, Touch HD.  Yet this is a completely new platform. <br><br>  <b>findings</b> <br>  1. High-quality sound in bluetooth stereo exists. <br>  2. DR-BT21G is an excellent choice for listening to music and telephony.  Recommended for owners of Q1 Ultra. <br><br>  <b>thank</b> <br>  Thanks to Yandex.market for photos of all devices in one place, all references to the source are given in the text. <br>  Thanks to the staff of the stores who charged the initially discharged headsets so that I could try them on. <br>  Thank you for your attention, and for not judging strictly such a superficial review. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/57574/">https://habr.com/ru/post/57574/</a></p>
