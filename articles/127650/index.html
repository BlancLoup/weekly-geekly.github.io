Metro approach</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If you've seen Windows Phone 7, you've already seen Metro.  Metro is a design language for applications, grown in the depths of Microsoft, whose elements are already penetrating different products and, of course, the soul of the WP7 platform.  Metro is a start from scratch, a reset of design, a transition from a hard-to-support Windows Mobile language to a language with clear principles and objectives. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ef/b47/cc5/1efb47cc56ee91f0fa856461ee8030db.png"><br><br>  When several years ago the design team decided to try to start from scratch, instead of looking at what already exists on various, in general, monotonous platforms, it concentrated on what really inspires - the best design samples: from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_M%25C3%25BCller-Brockmann">Josef M√ºller-Brockmann</a> (Swiss designer known for his simple design with vivid use of typography, shape and color, inspired by his works of many modern graphic designers) and other pioneers of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Typographic_Style">International Style</a> , the <a href="http://www.vignelli.com/">Massimo Vignelli</a> design system of the New York map  whom the metro and famous brands like american airlines are up to the conceptual work of <a href="http://www.experimentaljetset.nl/">Experimental Jetset</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a>

This encourages focusing on the priorities of the UI and makes the UI look smart, open, fast, and responsive. <br><br>  The UI should allow the user to quickly grasp the very essence of the information and only if necessary plunge into the details.  And at the same time, the offer for immersion and research can also be part of the UI, this is the purpose, for example, resolved by the panorama in Windows Phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/37d/ad0/306/37dad0306f8222e2480bfb89f533b176.png"><br><br>  Prioritize, highlighting the main tasks, try to achieve more with less means and remove all unnecessary.  And, of course, free space is also one of the important components of the designed UI.  Empty space is not to be afraid - we must be able to work with it.  Filling all the available space with something should not be an end in itself.  Many things can be simplified, to show schematically or obviously symbolic. <br><br>  Think over the functionality of your application and build it in accordance with the importance and frequency of use, putting in the first place exactly what the user came to, and removing everything else to the background. <br><br><h3>  High-quality typography </h3><br>  Metro-design is largely inspired by the best examples of high-quality typography.  It seems the time has come for the user interface to be tied to typography too.  Font is information.  Beauty, clarity and correctness of the choice of font - the path to an open and understandable information design. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/849/773/bf0/849773bf0ea990d694f857db70878781.png"><br><br>  When thinking about using a font, keep in mind the thickness, size, case, and balance of the various UI elements.  In particular, in different functional blocks, spelling of the text can be used in lowercase, uppercase letters or as in a sentence.  In Windows Phone, the navigation hierarchy is built up by matching / physical / placing text blocks relative to each other and is underlined by font size and case.  For example, the title of a section or application is written in Pivot in a smaller font and in upper case, and the title of the current tab is larger and in lower case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/faf/10e/814/faf10e81421b58c1d19d189303b15e07.png"><br><br>  For the WP7 platform, a modification of the Segoe font family ‚Äî Segoe WP ‚Äî was developed, available both in the design and development tools and on the device itself. <br><br><h3>  Alive on the move </h3><br>  Metro is a living system in which movement, responsiveness and reaction, transitions are as important as the screens with which the user interacts.  Movement gives character UI and at the same time helps to understand the navigation system, which helps to improve usability. <br><br>  Movement gives a sense of depth and immersion in content, moving to detail or back to the top level.  Jyzhenie relies on a sense of size and orientation in space.  The live system responds to user actions, prompts where you can click and what you can interact with.  At the intuitive level, it guides and helps to figure out what's what. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/qZML1LzClT4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhj30MXkkVvPsR3AZ3BqUJ1YnB9Vrg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Responsive UI elements fill the interaction with the system.  See also the many review videos on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/windowsphone">the Windows Phone channel</a> on Youtube. <br><br><h3>  Content first </h3><br>  The user comes for information, and not to click on the buttons.  Reducing non-content visual content will help you create an open and lightweight UI.  Information should be located in such a way as to encourage the user to explore it and interact with it directly, and not through special buttons.  Important information should be presented immediately, secondary and detailed go into the background, but be available in one action. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/88b/bb4/d43/88bbb4d430c78dccf34ae97c972fb46d.png"><br><br>  Content should not just be on its own, it is part of the UI ‚Äî and even more: content is UI. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/59c/275/128/59c275128fa3921efbc179e536afef16.png"><br><br>  And unlike traditional iconographic systems: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/46c/45c/d25/46c45cd25fc974e1fb25da5639b270a7.png"><br><br>  Metro-design systems are more focused on infographics, in which even the elements on the start screen are filled with life and information, and in the internal content, priority is given to content, not design and buttons;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f6b/486/f79/f6b486f793ee1cf14f5a86a316518c54.png"><br><br>  If the first approach is filled with realistic metaphors from the real world - a kind of hyperrealism in design, in which analog content is transformed into digital counterparts and the work is built around the organization and manipulation of content, the second seeks to provide content as it is, remembering that digital form can provide additional benefits and opportunities, and not always a direct analogy is the best way.  The infographic approach expands the objects (for example, people and places) with relevant available information, allows you to overlay information and interact directly with it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aca/055/7e4/aca0557e4bf29213f31fc04ee3a04350.png"><br><br>  This does not mean that photographic (media) content loses relevance in metro design.  For example, it only gains importance, since content has absolute priority over UI elements.  A photo is content, not a button background. <br><br><h3>  Digital honesty </h3><br>  Finally, metro-design professes honesty in design.  UI is created for pixels, so in Metro we try to avoid using analogies with the real world in the form of shadows and highlights used in some UI for mimicry for materials and objects of the real world (so-called skeuomorphic-design). <br><br>  Honesty also implies a design under the form factor, consideration of the features of interaction with the device with the help of fingers and, of course, a direct presentation of information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e1c/273/ff9/e1c273ff989b244a86e75757121aede4.png"><br><br>  The UI should not be what it is not.  Be honest with your users. <br><br>  It‚Äôs not always a direct transfer of a solution from another platform to WP7 without considering the design features will be the best solution.  Try to integrate into the platform and into the features of the design, which she lives. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b99/b43/719/b99b4371926ad947da2e492c62019d43.png"><br><br>  Make the metro work for you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ed/92a/1f6/0ed92a1f6736255ff82e9bb1696069d3.png"><br><br><h2>  Present and future </h2><br>  Although the transition from Windows Mobile 6.5 to Windows Phone 7 is in itself a big step, the Metro design team is also looking to the future, suggesting a careful and thoughtful evolution.  Metro is not something designed to be different from everything else.  This is the foundation for future development over a long time, the starting point on the way there, which seems to us to be the next era in user interface design, focused more on content than on metaphors, information, not tools, and movement, not static.  It is a language designed to clearly mark the information around us, removing the accompanying garbage. <br><br>  Interfaces like those we all saw in science fiction like Avatar or Iron Man 2 are a matter of several years, but Metro already seems like a good starting point. <br><br><h3>  Metro-approach in real projects </h3><br>  The ideas of metro-design are already fully applied in various projects (this does not even take into account the thousands of applications for Windows Phone 7). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d84/8fa/189/d848fa18992a51d92e1c4ddd5a8d9ff5.png"><br><br>  Already today you can try <a href="http://www.metrotwit.com/">MetroTwit</a> , a metro-style Twitter client, or <a href="http://www.metrotwit.com/show/">MetroTwit Show</a> , an interesting application for showing tweets (for example, during a conference or just as a screen saver). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7aa/c3c/404/7aac3c4046d00110ba6f734f0cdad5df.png"><br><br>  Special <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/e56d790d-ceea-43e6-8ce2-06d274ef7654">metro-theme</a> is for applications made using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/lightswitch/ff796201">Visual Studio LightSwitch</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ca/2e5/6b0/6ca2e56b0ae94d99c9cb38f97075573d.jpg"><br><br>  And for a long time <a href="http://www.silverlight.net/content/samples/sl4/themes/cosmopolitan.html">there is</a> a <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/%3FLinkId%3D192411">metro theme</a> for any Silverlight and WPF applications.  And many of our partners (for example, <a href="http://www.telerik.com/">telerik</a> ), producing controllers for the Microsoft platform, also <a href="http://blogs.telerik.com/blogs/posts/11-06-22/metro-ui-for-radcontrols-for-silverlight-and-wpf.aspx">work to ensure that they are in the style of Metro UI</a> .  Here is another <a href="http://silverzine.com/resources/7metro-silverlight-theme/">example</a> of <a href="http://twitter.com/">Alex Knight's</a> <a href="http://silverzine.com/resources/7metro-silverlight-theme/">Metro in Silverlight</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bf9/7c3/615/bf97c3615a7ff71751dd529aa4f73187.png"><br><br>  Another interesting example is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowslive/whatsyourinboxlike/">the Windows Live Hotmail website</a> .  By the way, it uses HTML5. <br><br>  Finally, you've probably already seen our updated <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/">MSDN</a> site or <a href="http://pnpsummit.ru/">P &amp; P Summit</a> site.  Quite right, the metro-penetrates into the Saito structure no less than on the desktop or mobile platforms. <br><br>  And, although, in the first place, in all these cases, recognizability of stylistics is striking, the most important thing is that the use of certain graphic elements does not lose the essence, that is, those principles that we spoke about from the very beginning: <br><ul><li>  Easy, simple, open and fast. </li><li>  High-quality typography </li><li>  Alive on the move </li><li>  Content first </li><li>  Digital honesty </li></ul><br><h3>  Windows 8 </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dc2/aa0/9df/dc2aa09df1fe60f6c8937ffdaefd7bf7.png"><br><br>  Although we cannot tell any additional details today, you will surely <br>  Already saw an <a href="http://win8.ms/uxpreview1">overview of the interface of the</a> next version of Windows.
