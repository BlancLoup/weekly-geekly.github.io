  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Note for idealists - US analysts for the complete openness of information</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As you know, in America people pay a lot of attention to all sorts of terrorist attacks.  On the one hand, they can be understood, the twin towers - this is not to beat the windows on the balconies.  On the other hand, England, for example, also suffered a lot from hitting the metro and buses, but there was no such rush. <br><br>  On top of that, America was also unlucky in terms of natural disasters - the south there still cannot really recover from Katrina‚Äôs invasion.  And we, by the way, are still buying cars that they dig out from under the silt.  But it is, by the way. <br>  In general, in this long-suffering country, fundamental research has long and seriously begun to help prevent terrorist attacks and to respond as quickly as possible to natural disasters and all sorts of technological disasters. <br><br>  And this is what the older comrades from the <a href="http://www.rand.org/">RAND Corporation</a> company write to us in the study <a href="http://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/MG595.1/">‚ÄúByting Back‚Äù</a> .

      <strong>Total control over the population - is necessary</strong> . <br><br>  Here are some abstracts from a 195-page report: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>It is necessary to know not only the number of population in each specific area, but also the location of specific people, as well as their psychological characteristics.</i>  <i>It is necessary in order to control the illegal entry of migrants, to prevent the creation of terrorist and partisan groups, to control anti-state sentiments, and to be able to work quickly in areas of natural disasters or technological disasters.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  Is it logical  Is logical.  If I were any minister of the Ministry of Emergency Situations - I would do the same. <br>  <i>It is also necessary to have information about the location and nature of the buildings - the number of floors, purpose, location of communications, etc., in case of conducting anti-terrorist actions.</i>  <i>Naturally, we need data on the topography of the area and the location of strategic facilities.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  This, as it seems, is also quite understandable step.  Who knows, if our special services had thoroughly studied the approaches to the Nord-Ost and the layout of manholes there, everything could have gone much better. <br>  <i>The collection of data on local and population arriving in the region is necessary, respectively, to minimize harm to local residents and to conduct in-depth control over recent migrants from other regions or from abroad.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  This is about what, and about illegal migrants, the residents of this country do not need any explanations. <br>  <i>The importance of information about the specific location of each person in a specific period of time due to the need for timely evacuation of civilians from the places of holding actions against insurgents or natural disasters and the provision of medical and other assistance affected by these actions.</i>  <i>Accordingly, it becomes necessary to monitor the health status of children, the elderly and the disabled, for the timely response of rescue services.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  And it‚Äôs also true, you won‚Äôt carp.  The most reasonable thing is to know who to save first. <br>  But then the interesting begins. <br>  <i>In order to prevent the planning of malicious actions by hostile groups and in time to identify the accomplices from the local population, it is necessary to <strong>monitor telephone and Internet negotiations</strong> .</i>  <i>In addition to this, it is necessary to systematically compile psychological maps for each person - to search for unreliable people in terms of state support.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  This is here, if you look at the step from the state, the step is very clear and follows from all the previous ones.  But if you look from the side of the observed subject, it‚Äôs somehow not done on its own.  Although, it seems, I do not write anything reprehensible and do not help insurgents.  Nevertheless, suddenly I am psychologically unstable (for example, howling the moon monthly), and I will be recorded as a probable informer?  Enough is not enough. <br><br>  But, strangely, the opinion of the population is of little interest in that deep-democratic country. <br><br>  Therefore: <br>  <i>All these actions must be carried out (and carried out in the United States) in three main ways:</i> <i><br></i> <ol><li>  Analytical sources - research of information from open (for the state) sources, such as databases of passport and visa services, tax service, public utilities, insurance and medical institutions, etc. </li><li>  Obtaining information directly from the population through a census, opinion polls and other similar methods. </li><li>  Listening to telephone (including cellular) conversations, logging with Internet providers, taking data from outdoor surveillance cameras. </li></ol><br>  I note that the RAND report explicitly states that it is only necessary to enter into contracts for the construction of cellular communications in the area with those operators who can provide telephone call records and SMS correspondence, the subscriber‚Äôs location, the ability to link specific entries to a specific subscriber.  Also, the PPSOS should be provided with unhindered access to the records of all pro-government services. <br>  <i>When receiving alarming data from automated systems, such as monitoring telephone conversations or logs</i> <i><br></i>  <i>an Internet provider, that is, when the automation is triggered by keywords, a specific person is transferred to in-depth control by security forces.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  In total, we get just such parsley.  To prevent terrorist attacks and guerrilla actions on the territory of the state, it is necessary to control (and is controlled, at least, on the territory of the United States) according to this, far from complete list: <br><ol><li>  Topography of the area. </li><li>  Location of strategic objects. </li><li>  Location and communication of buildings. </li><li>  Entry / departure of people. </li><li>  Geographical position of each person. </li><li>  Control over recently living people. </li><li>  The state of health of social groups at risk. </li><li>  Telephone conversations. </li><li>  Internet conversations. </li><li>  Psychological characteristics of each person. </li></ol><br>  Such tedious things have to be dealt with by the local MChS, FBI and TsRUshniki in order to maintain order in the country, and, if possible, outside of it. <br><br>  I will explain to people who do not understand or do not want to understand the reasons for the need to monitor the population - no one wants to use your bank card, threaten your classmates, extort money from you, take a credit from your passport data, withdraw commercial information from your email .  This state does not need.  The state needs order and stability, and they can be achieved only if you know exactly among whom you implant good and to whom exactly love you cause. <br><br>  To be continued ... <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/22006/">https://habr.com/ru/post/22006/</a></p>
