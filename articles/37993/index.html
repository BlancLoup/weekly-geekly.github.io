    <h1>  0. What is the card, in general? </h1><br>  So, a plastic card is essentially a piece of plastic, on which data about a special ‚Äúcard‚Äù account is entered, which can be managed with the help of a card. <br><br>  To manage - it does not mean that this account can be managed in the same way as a regular account.  With regard to the card, today there are the following operations: <br><ul><li>  You can withdraw cash from a ‚Äúcard‚Äù account at an ATM; </li><li>  You can pay by card if the seller has the ability to accept such payments; </li><li>  You can replenish your ‚Äúcard‚Äù account from some (advanced) ATMs. </li></ul><br><br>  It should be remembered that the "card" account is somewhat different from the usual bank account.  Card account can be attached to the usual, but not vice versa.  In any case, if the client has a card in the bank that serves him, then there will definitely be a regular account. <br><br><h1>  1. Why is it necessary, or a little history </h1><br>  Cards first appeared in the United States, and at first they were used only to more conveniently serve customers at gas stations, giving them a certain kind of credit.  Then various gas stations began to accept each other‚Äôs cards and went off, in 1958 the Visa system appeared, in 1966 - MasterCard. <br><br>  In general, I must say that the name of the cards "credit" is not quite true.  Rather, for their homeland - it is quite true, but for Russia - not yet fully. <br><br>  So, the cards appeared in order to make it easier to issue small amounts of credit for the goods to the client.  For example, Americans did not like to carry a lot of money with them all the time, because this system was invented in general. <br>  Following the path of globalization, after the emergence of such market players as Visa and MasterCard, this system ‚Äúclosed in‚Äù, that is, the standard credit card user lives permanently on credit.  At the end of the billing period (usually a month, but there are variations), he receives a printout of bills and pays for it. <br><br>  However, a nice-looking picture will now be a bit torn to shreds.  Despite the fact that the Visa system is a union of banks and processing centers, cards (unfortunately) are tied to specific banks.  In general, if you see the inscription Visa on an ATM, and the same inscription on your card is present, then 50% of what your card will be served is.  An ambush in another - the bank will take from you a non-sickly commission for a transaction with a card of another bank. <br><br><h1>  2. Russia and the difficult path of cards </h1><br>  Of course, a loan for Russia is a complicated thing.  We have consumer loans until 2000 were virtually unattainable, and then, when the market "pulled" forward, they began to appear.  But the cards were there, but not credit.  And issuing banks - count on fingers. <br><br>  In Russia, debit cards are still the most popular, that is, to use the amount on the "card" account, you must first put it there.  In principle, this question is quite simply solved if the salary is transferred to the card. <br><br><h2>  2.1.  Problem one - lack of terminals </h2><br>  What do you think contributes to the development of payments using cards?  That's right, the first right way out is to be able to accept cards almost everywhere. <br><br>  And here is the main problem of our country.  To carry out a card transaction, the seller, before accepting payment, must somehow contact the bank to check the availability of money (if the card is debit) or credit (if the card is credit), and this may not be possible everywhere in our vast country. <br><br>  The first conclusion: you can easily put a card in your pocket and not take a wallet when even street toilets are equipped with a terminal for receiving such payments. <br><br><h2>  2.2.  Problem two - few ATMs or little cash </h2><br>  It is clear that for a standard Russian worker, to whom they began to transfer wages to a card, to pay off in a rural shop with a card does not shine.  Therefore, in Russia there is a completely abnormal turnover in relation to withdrawing money from a card account. <br><br>  It turns out the following situation - the ATMs of the desired bank are always smaller within a radius of 100 meters than we would like, as cash can still run out there. <br><br><blockquote>  In my city there are only 5 or 6 ATMs of the most slaughter SB RF.  In the days of the salary of large enterprises there is no money at all.  Basically.  And a kilometer long queue if there is money </blockquote><br><br>  It is clear that in a critical case, you can go to the bank itself, which issued the card, and get the cherished cash there, but this somewhat ruins the need for the card. <br><br><h2>  2.3.  Problem three - you need to train sellers </h2><br>  Hedgehog it is clear that even the cards of the same system (Visa, for example) are different.  There is easier, there is more abruptly.  And work with each type of cards should be clear to the seller. <br><br><blockquote>  A simple example is the Visa Electron card, the simplest product on the debit card market, does not require entering a PIN code when purchasing.  The buyer is certified by checking the signature on the card and in the passport.  However, the seller, in most cases, do not care about it.  And if the card is stolen? </blockquote><br><br><h2>  2.4.  The fourth problem - the cards are non-cash </h2><br>  Those who are somewhat off topic, about non-cash money, I can recommend a couple of my own articles ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/my_business/30205/">one</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/my_business/30216/">two</a> ).  Well, those who are in the subject, they understand that the money received from the "card" account is credited to the bank account of the recipient. <br><br>  As one would expect, this becomes a problem for those who are used to working with cash, paying with suppliers.  Money from the bank still needs to be withdrawn, and this can only be done at a certain time and is not as easy as we would like. <br><br>  Of course, the situation is changing for the better.  For example, <a href="http://www.tcsbank.ru/">Tinkoff Credit Systems</a> and other banks are already providing quite reasonable credit cards. <br><br>  In addition, a pleasant overdraft service on some types of cards has become available for quite a long time. <br><br><blockquote>  For example, a Visa Gold card allows for quite a pleasant overdraft, the amount is about 35 thousand rubles, but not everyone will be given such a card. </blockquote><br><br><h1>  3. Internet payments </h1><br>  Well, it goes without saying that one of the most enjoyable things for cardholders is online payments.  And really, why pay through any bank if you can use a card to pay? <br><br>  But no, and everything is not so simple. <br><br>  Payments via the Internet are not available for all types of cards.  <s>For example, the Visa Electron card already mentioned by me does not allow such payments to be made.</s>  <b>Update:</b> I apologize, thanks to the readers managed to find out that it depends on the bank. <br><br>  In fact, the history of the development of payments through the Internet was difficult, accompanied by numerous cases of card theft and other tears. <br><br>  Now, in principle, the situation has changed for the better.  And the security services began to respond more quickly, and a special code for purchases was put on the cards in cases when the card was not physically involved. <br><br><h1>  4. How can this card help my business? </h1><br>  Now let's think about how the cards can be useful to us as business owners. <br><br><h2>  4.1.  Salary on cards </h2><br>  If you issue a salary in cash, then they must be withdrawn before issuing.  Very often, the percentage of servicing cards and withdrawing cash from them is much cheaper.  Therefore, many employers choose this way of salary payment.  Saving 1% of the total amount of salary issued for the year can be tangible. <br><br><h2>  4.2.  Quick credit through cards </h2><br>  If you honestly and regularly use the card, the bank can provide you with an overdraft, that is, the ability to quickly get a loan on fairly favorable terms.  Sometimes it is very topic. <br><br><h2>  4.3.  Business trip </h2><br>  If you send an employee on a business trip, the most convenient way is to give him a card.  You clearly control the amount of money spent by him, and you can also have a special account where you can attach several cards at the same time. <br><br><h1>  5. Summing up </h1><br>  Honestly, the situation with plastic cards is still depressing in Russia.  If you do not take into account Moscow, all other regions use them poorly.  The bad business skills (often) and the lack of a normal infrastructure for working with them also have an effect. <br><br>  Of course, as usual, we all hope for the best and expect that even in taxis we will accept the card as a payment, but all this for now is hope. <br><br>  As usual, all your questions are in the comments;  I will try to answer. <br><br>  With love, <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/maniaque/" class="user_link">maniaque</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/37993/">https://habr.com/ru/post/37993/</a></p>
