Most recently, I matured to another "feat", namely, to install a water cooling system. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/106394/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f5b/df5/0ce/f5bdf50ce239398d9780bfe9de12e2d5.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  If you are interested in a detailed illustrated guide to the assembly / installation of such a system (for example, productive config), then welcome under cat.  <u>Traffic!</u> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Radiators and coolers - even writing is not so interesting about it, because all this has long been in any computer and this will not surprise anyone.  Liquid nitrogen and any phase transition systems there are another extreme, the chances of meeting with which in the economy of an ordinary person are almost nil.  But the "dropsy" ... in terms of cooling the computer is like a happy medium - unusual, but affordable;  almost no noise, but at the same time anything can cool.  In fairness, SVO (water cooling system) is more appropriate to call LSS (liquid cooling system), because, in fact, you can pour anything inside.  But, running ahead, I used plain water, so I‚Äôll use more the term CBO.

      Most recently, I wrote in some detail about the assembly of a new system unit.  The resulting stand looked like this: <br><br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/92759/"><b>Thermaltake Level 10</b></a> housing <br>  - <a href="http://www.thermaltake.com/product_info.aspx%3FPARENT_CID%3DC_00001561%26id%3DC_00001562%26name%3DToughpower%2BGrand%2B750W%26ov%3Dn%26ovid%3Dn"><b>Thermaltake Toughpower Grand 750W</b></a> Power Supply <br>  - <b><a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/199576/">ASUS Rampage III Extreme</a></b> motherboard <br>  - <a href="http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx%3Fid%3D41447"><b>Intel Core i7-930 processor</b></a> <br>  - <b><a href="http://leadtek.com/ru/3d_graphic/overview.asp%3Flineid%3D1%26pronameid%3D556%26check%3Df">Leadtek GeForce GTX 480</a></b> video <b><a href="http://leadtek.com/ru/3d_graphic/overview.asp%3Flineid%3D1%26pronameid%3D556%26check%3Df">card</a></b> <br>  - Memory <b><a href="http://www.crucial.com/store/partspecs.aspx%3FIMODULE%3DBL3KIT25664TB1608">Crucial Ballistix Tracer</a></b> <br>  - <b><a href="http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.asp%3Fdriveid%3D788">WD SiliconEdge Blue SSD</a></b> Hard Drive <br><br>  Thoughtful study of the list suggests that the heat emission of some devices is not just high, but VERY high.  And if you connect everything as it is, then inside even the most spacious case will be at least hot;  and as practice shows, it will also be very noisy. <br><br>  Let me remind you that the case in which the computer is going is not very practical (although every time I see the opposite), but very presentable <b>Thermaltake Level 10</b> - it has disadvantages, but for just one appearance it can be forgiven him a lot . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b76/6d0/f29/b766d0f29e1d85ee52cc9e834e7e0487.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/92759/">did a review of</a> this case, then a less productive stand was going to it - everything was fine with the temperature regime, although, according to the statements of many reputable iron sites, the case was not designed to collect really powerful configs.  Moreover, in the opinion of these publications, the case is also unsuitable for the installation of a liquid cooling system, with which I agreed at one time without verification.  Finally, it was possible to disprove both of these statements, making a few useful things - assembling a computer, installing a water-cooling system in it and telling you about it.  Let me tell you on the example of a rare and expensive body, but nothing prevents you from applying your knowledge on any other case - it will only be easier! <br><br>  And the last.  I have long thought about how to submit all the information received.  As a result, after looking at 1000+ photos taken during the work, I wrote a universal algorithm (sequence of actions) for assembling CBO - I got 8 points, about each of which I wrote in detail and with pictures.  Someone may get less of these items, some more, but in general, this ‚ÄúHowTo‚Äù can be used for any system - add to favorites, you see, it will be useful;) <br><br><h2>  Go-go-go! </h2><br>  On one of the non-working days (on weekends) I arrived at a jam-packed car in the store and we almost immediately began to solve the problem.  Besides me, there were two more people (Maxim and Alexey), the third one came in the evening to look at the result and offer us a way to solve one problem (because of which the assembly of the system was very long).  Looking ahead - it is very good that everything happened in the store, where everything was necessary - without it, I would have spent 100% more money, time and nerves. <br><br>  So, the goal was set - <b>to assemble a single-circuit water cooling system, which would effectively cool the motherboard, processor and video card.</b>  <b>Maximum quiet, ideally - with the possibility of further upgrading the system</b> . <br><br>  Having estimated the plan of action, the necessary hardware and its presence on the shelves of the store, we took up the screwdrivers.  Whatever one may say, it‚Äôs necessary to start from the motherboard - it‚Äôs the most important thing on the computer. <br><br><h2>  Installing a fullcover-waterblock on the motherboard </h2><br>  Motherboard <b><a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/199576/">ASUS Rampage III Extreme is</a></b> very popular in the overclocking environment - if you look at world records, in very many cases it appears exactly.  The great potential and technological prospects, the ‚Äúfreshness‚Äù of the model and the ASUS brand itself - all this was the result of the appearance on the market of various accessories sharpened specifically for this board.  In particular, I'm talking about fullcover-waterblock (of which there are already <a href="http://overhard.ru/Asus-Rampage-III-Extreme.html">three different models</a> on the overhead for this board).  Fullcover - means that this piece of iron covers all the necessary elements of the board (very hot, especially during overclocking), such as mosfets, north and south bridges. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e52/f19/794/e52f19794047a349f975667f95e0a60a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For motherboards it is simpler (and for less common) there are quite a few ordinary water blocks that cool only one area or another, but in this case it is easy to run into a ‚Äúfile‚Äù, and the number of liquid tubes will in any case be larger. <br><br>  We chose the <b>EK-FB RE3</b> fullcover water block (from EK Waterblocks), an expensive piece of metal with all kinds of cavities, which is suitable as a device for the device, skilfully bypassing all capacitors, protrusions and other relief features. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9d2/f6d/685/9d2f6d6858572d1c94240216f6a2bf30.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  When designing motherboards, the radiators of the power subsystem of the central processor are designed for cooling by the central processor cooler.  When installing SVO, mosfets lose blowing, and even with a slight acceleration, their temperature can reach a critical 100 degrees.  So the fullcover for ASUS Rampage III Extreme is what the doctor ordered! <br><br>  Pay attention to how complex the waterblock is.  In addition to mirror polishing the base, an unusual shape of the piece of iron itself and precisely milled holes for capacitors, inside there is a space (with a no less complex geometry) along which water will flow.  Horror. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cc0/303/12e/cc030312e34316291179b31d8e2afcc0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/714/dbd/84b/714dbd84b0e58cc4c4f1cc58acba8a92.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ce/a5d/65f/4cea5d65f7cd267c5cad6924f410667b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The installation process is so ugly.  We unscrew the 9 screws on which the stock fullcover radiator rests - it is beautiful, so we will not throw it out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/516/574/6ad/5165746ad5bfe21afb56e2db28633f1f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Max at work)</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/33c/3ac/7e1/33c3ac7e12d74a0ce0a2705a740a5b22.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Along the way, we pull out the glowing puck ‚ÄúROG Connect‚Äù - it will still come in handy for us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac3/420/371/ac342037168c847f6fe74441733f70ec.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Then we take some fleece and remove the thermal interface that was on the chips under the radiator.  You can use a special liquid for removing thermal paste - it helps.  Next, we take the thermal pad (it comes with the water block) and, following the instructions, cut out the necessary pieces - paste them onto the mother's circuit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/120/f09/b00/120f09b00b46cd39e141f568bf245f99.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Next, simply fasten the water block, after installing the ‚Äústandofy‚Äù (small plastic rings, which allow you to prevent distortions and peretyagov water block) in the holes for the screws. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/384/987/68d/38498768d43d74f4289688518314bad7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The weight of the waterblock is 550 grams, so for the reliability on the back of the motherboard you need to install a backplane that distributes the load. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/90e/76b/777/90e76b777eeabf6a7960649a2fcbc2e3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The final stroke is the installation of the ROG Connect indicator, for which there is now a corresponding dimple.  With good luck, in the load mode, such a water block can take up to 40 degrees heat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9f5/448/13e/9f544813e290c03cd6c46ba28c5849e0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ec/c4f/a18/4ecc4fa189c839270a169984b1456c26.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Installing the waterblock on the processor </h2><br>  So that the motherboard could be put aside for a while, we decided to install a waterblock on the processor too - for obvious reasons, only fullcover is available for processors :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ccd/402/472/ccd4024725e766d3d6a3f12125a529f6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We used a cross socket (775/1366) <b>Enzotech Stealth</b> - a stylish black water block, made in compliance with the highest requirements (the base is polished to a mirror finish, the maximum deviation from the straight line is less than 0.0003 inch). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b3/780/194/6b378019411079a7f732147dc02bd46a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition to it, the bundle included: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/710/23c/845/71023c845356da5eb7eb40ab3e117ce9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/088/a3f/a3b/088a3fa3bdbfff033e819adadb1cc2be.png" align="left" alt="image">  - backplane for 775 and 1366 sockets <br>  - One <a href="http://overhard.ru/Enzotech-1366EZ.html"><b>Enzotech 1366EZ</b></a> mounting frame <br>  - 4 nylon spacers <br>  - 4 fixing screws <br>  - 2 Christmas tree-type high-flow fittings with a diameter of 13mm (with o-rings) <br>  - 2 hose clamps with an inner diameter of 13 mm <br>  - Tube of thermal <b>silver Arctic Silver Ceramique</b> <br><br>  The scheme of actions is about the same, only nothing needs to be dismantled - first install the protective backplane on the back side of the motherboard (the weight of the water block is 250 grams), and put a special frame on the front side (as is the case with air coolers). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b9c/19a/386/b9c19a3865076de1cd8e9df7bde80de8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d42/92f/fe3/d4292ffe3252855f7ac6ad94accdbc19.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We open the socket, put the processor in it, similarly we clean (already from the fat) the heat-spreading lid of the processor, apply a thin layer of thermal paste and place the water block itself on top.  Just in case, you can immediately remove it to make sure (due to poor visibility) that there is a necessary contact between the processor cover and the base of the water block.  Once again carefully we clean both surfaces and, with full confidence in the screwdriver, tighten the screws on the water block. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c3b/c3b/239/c3bc3b239a5b614ced0382873a094ca0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/707/c56/307/707c56307f3b2538bab00117975d9772.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In order not to lose the parts, we twist both fittings from the kit - they are by default quite stylish.  Everything. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/938/e5d/74d/938e5d74d40fbb76fe17a55253dc1a8d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Installing a fullcover-waterblock on a video card </h2><br>  If we deprive the component parts of the guarantee, then all at once;) Now we have come to the hottest component of the system, to the <b><a href="http://leadtek.com/ru/3d_graphic/overview.asp%3Flineid%3D1%26pronameid%3D556%26check%3Df">Leadtek GeForce GTX 480</a></b> video card - if you believe the tests, then this lady warms up to 100+ degrees in the load, which is accompanied by a no less disturbing noise stock turbines. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b5f/83d/625/b5f83d625605e566f428d996f5d3a68e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  To complete the picture, it was decided to also use the fullcover-water block.  For video cards with <b>NVIDIA Fermi architecture,</b> there are already quite a few of them, and we, apparently, were lucky - Leadtek GeForce GTX 480 had a ‚Äúreference design‚Äù, that is, the one that was originally designed by NVIDIA itself.  Most often, the most obvious sign of a non-reference design is a nonstandard cooling system - what manufacturers give out as a plus (in fact, it is).  It is much worse when the layout on the board is modified - it will be much more difficult to guess. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a3/0c3/a5e/7a30c3a5efefe46c620eaa30253aa4db.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the hope that everything will be fine, we have begun to dismantle the factory cooling system (the loss of warranty starts from this stage).  In the case of this video card, the process is somewhat tiring - 17 screws from the PCB side and 2 from the side of the connectors.  Next, carefully remove the entire radiator by disconnecting the cooler wire from the board beforehand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/284/ba3/0fa/284ba30fa7f337baed7fa3729ddd6310.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The fitting of the fullcover-waterblock <a href="http://overhard.ru/EKFC480-GTX-Nickel.html"><b>EK-FC480 GTX Nickel + Plexi</b></a> was successful - it fit perfectly) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8f0/d21/c08/8f0d21c085f9e6c74207c8a4735cfb99.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/279/9e3/90d/2799e390db59673fa95084c83482e55a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Open the instructions, proceed to cutting thermal pads (it is best to do this with scissors, which is not a pity or clerical knife). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/737/c5f/475/737c5f475db32575070b5352564ae01d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Gluing the thermal pads - it is very important to glue them correctly, so read the instructions carefully! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/126/483/d7d/126483d7d906c74efe31ef83fd69daa6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We put the stand-ins in the mounting holes of the waterblock, clean the GPU cover with a special liquid, apply a thin layer of thermal paste and dress the waterblock. <br><br>  For reliability, this high-tech sandwich lacks 9 screws - the most important thing is not to tighten them very much! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a3e/989/571/a3e989571adc1e93a7671a0192fadb9f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Next, the video card was tried on to the motherboard - beautifully, of course, but the textolite is completely unpresentable.  Moreover, it can be accidentally touched and damaged, water can drip on top of it ... in general, it was decided to install a decorative-protective fullcover backplane, which was <b>EK-FC480 GTX Backplate Nickel</b> .  With its installation there were no problems at all - they established and understood that they had not lost.  Actually, everything. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f2c/d64/164/f2cd64164d00c1f0ef9079d1ed78a92a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/30c/9c9/866/30c9c9866a476b9a4eade25e68901e8f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/005/f31/52b/005f3152b44bd85b85888877b80167b1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Even when I was working for the ‚Äúskinny‚Äù GeForce 2 MX 400, and the people were taking the 8800s with might and main - I think it was from that moment that many (and I, too) had to remember that the video card is something sooo big.  What to talk about modern ‚Äúfools‚Äù, which have ceased to fit in many cases (some video cards are nearly 30 cm long!).  Then it always seemed to me that under a protective casing such various electronics are teeming, but as it turned out, most of the space is occupied by the cooling system radiator - the board itself is very thin. <br><br>  I mean, it‚Äôs very unusual to see such a thin top-end video card - the height of the water block is only 8.8 millimeters, so the total amount of video cards is a little over a centimeter, which is less than the height of the plug for the PCI slot!  Accordingly, there will be no problems with the creation of an SLI system (for 2-3-4 video cards). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee1/56c/020/ee156c020d88e0c42780fdccd25ab512.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It involuntarily seems that such a system simply cannot work effectively ... but when you take it in hand ... By the way, the weight of a water block alone is 950 grams without fittings and caps!  The weight of the video card assembly <a href="">was</a> 1.22 kg. <br><br>  At this stage, the motherboard was installed in the case, a video card was inserted into it - previously in the top PCI slot. <br><br><h2>  Installation of radiator / pump / reservoir </h2><br>  One of the most interesting stages of work, which took us the most time (if we went right along the easy way, we would have managed it in half an hour, but first we tried all the difficult options, because of which all the work was dragged out for 2 days (of course, far incomplete). <br><br>  The water cooling system is very similar to the one used in cars, just a little bigger - there is also a radiator (most often not one), cooler, coolant, etc.  But the car has one advantage - a solid counter-flow of cold air, which plays a key role in cooling the system while driving. <br><br>  In the case of a computer, heat is removed by the air in the room.  Accordingly, the larger the size of the radiator and the number of coolers, the better.  And since you want a minimum of noise, effective cooling will be achieved mainly due to the surface of the radiator. <br><br>  And the essence of the problem was as follows.  In Skype, we previously agreed on the opinion ‚Äúwe will hang it from behind the radiator into 2-3 sections - it is more than enough!‚Äù, But as soon as we looked at the case, it turned out that everything was not so simple.  Firstly, there really wasn‚Äôt enough space for a three-section radiator (if the radiator was mounted on the opening where the installation of the blow cooler is supposed to be installed), and secondly, even if it were enough, it wouldn‚Äôt have been possible to open the case itself - it would interfere "Door" of the system compartment :) <br><br>  In general, we counted at least four options for installing a radiator into a Thermaltake Level 10 enclosure - they are all possible, each would require a different amount of time, and each would have its own pros and cons.  I will begin with those that we considered, but which did not suit us: <br><br>  <b>1. Install the radiator on the back (from the user) side, that is, on the removable door.</b> <br>  <u>Pros:</u> <br>  + Possibility of horizontal and vertical installation of any radiator, at least for 3-4 coolers <br>  + Case size would not have increased <br><br>  <u>Minuses:</u> <br>  - I would have to drill from 4 to 6-8 holes in the door <br>  - It would be very inconvenient to remove the door <br>  - With a horizontal arrangement, a radiator with a nonstandard arrangement of the opening for filling the fluid would be required. <br>  - With a vertical arrangement, the hoses would be very long and with a large bend. <br>  - The case will be on my left (on the windowsill), and I don‚Äôt need warm air from the coolers in my face :) <br><br>  <b>2. Install the radiator from the top, on the "cover" of the power supply compartment.</b>  Pros and cons are identical. <br><br>  <b>3. Installing a two-piece radiator inside the system compartment</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8d0/f9c/fbd/8d0f9cfbdb697d85aa965e8d4e4da063.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <u>Pros:</u> <br>  + Easy solution <br>  + Outwardly there would be no change. <br>  + The system compartment door would open without problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b8e/32a/dd7/b8e32add7db232c3e35a7ab9585c6aeb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <u>Minuses:</u> <br>  - Only a 2-section radiator would fit (this is not enough for the config iron) <br>  - In this case, it would have been impossible to take cold air from where, and we did not want to drive warm air to and fro. <br>  - It would be difficult to "arrange" the pump and tank <br>  - Even if ultra-thin coolers were used, all SATA connectors would overlap (if they were output to the user, and not sideways, then this problem would not exist) <br><br>  In general, we have tried all these options to some extent - we spent a lot of time searching for the right components, fitting them, etc. <br><br>  The very last option turned out to be a rather unusual solution - maybe not the most beautiful at first glance, but really practical.  <b>This is the installation of the radiator on the back of the case through a special adjustable adapter with a mechanism of the ‚Äúscissors‚Äù type</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e40/f10/079/e40f100792bd99b71c47ec906bf25eb9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <u>Pros:</u> <br>  + I did not have to drill <br>  + Ability to hang ANY radiator <br>  + Excellent airflow <br>  + Do not block access to the connectors of the motherboard <br>  + Minimum length of hoses, minimum of bends <br>  + The design is removable and transportable <br><br>  <u>Minuses:</u> <br>  - Not the most presentable appearance :) <br>  - Open the door of the system compartment is not so easy <br>  - Enough expensive adapter <br><br>  Why did we come to this option last?  Because during the search for the previous three options, we accidentally found an adapter, which everyone had forgotten about, and it wasn‚Äôt in the online store) Looking at the only (last) copy of the <a href="http://www.koolance.com/water-cooling/product_info.php%3Fproduct_id%3D829"><b>Koolance Radiator Mounting Bracket</b></a> , I thought, ‚ÄúAnd why not come up with! ".  The point is the following - 4 "tapered nails" are inserted into the holes for attachment to the body of the rear blow cooler, on which a special frame is hung. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ac/bc7/723/7acbc7723c13737b444615552e36a45c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The design of this frame is such that its length can be changed by twisting the latches, and it is removed by mixing two parts of its body (so that the holes are unlocked and it can be removed from the ‚Äústuds‚Äù) - so I bent!  ) It is much easier to understand everything by photo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/440/674/e2c/440674e2ca2ee6b3fe0b6b2b2211dba9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The frame is metal and very durable - I was convinced of this when we hung a 3-section (for 3 coolers) radiator for testing.  Nothing dangles and does not swing, everything hangs tightly, but in the "decompressed" case, the door completely opened itself - this option completely suits me! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6c1/834/c46/6c1834c46670ebb9c0b2698c1ebcabbc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There were a huge number of radiators to choose from - black, white, red ...

Its advantage is that it combines three components at once - a radiator (MCR320 QP Radiator for three 120mm coolers), a reservoir for a liquid and a high-pressure pump ( </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">MCP350 Pump</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , a complete analog of the "ordinary" </font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Laing DDC</font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> pump</font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">). In fact, with such a piece of iron for SVO it will be necessary to purchase only water blocks, hoses and other trifles that we already had. The pump operates from 12V (from 8 to 13.2), emitting a noise of 24 ~ 26 dBA.

The rule is simple - from less heated to more. Accordingly, the "output" of the radiator is connected first with the waterblock of the motherboard, from it the output to the processor, then to the video card and only then back to the entrance to the radiator to cool. Since water is one for all, the temperature of all components will be approximately the same as a result - it is for these reasons that multi-loop systems are made, and for this reason it does not make sense to connect hard drives, RAM, etc. to the same circuit. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c3f/c43/0af/c3fc430af3ff03b38a44638c176b0c8a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The role of the hose went to the red </font></font><b><a href="http://overhard.ru/Feser-Tube---97127-mm-38-ID---12-OD---25M-Blister---UV-RED.html"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Feser Tube</font></font></a></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (PVC, operating temperature from -30 to + 70 ¬∞ C, tensile pressure of 10 MPa), for which special predatory tools were used.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38c/46f/702/38c46f702309e0bb86ccd323e7abb2a0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bb0/7ce/beb/bb07cebebddaacc2bc15c735bb9303af.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Cutting the hose smoothly may not be so difficult, but very important!

Initially, there were "hissing" sounds - due to air bubbles inside the circuit (they were visible in some places of the hoses).  To solve this problem, the radiator tank plug was opened - the air gradually came out of the circulation and the system began to work even quieter.  After topping up the fluid, the plug was closed and the computer worked for another 10 minutes. Noise from the power supply cooler and from three on the radiator could not be heard at all, although their air currents made themselves felt. <br><br>  Making sure that the system is fully operational, we decided to finally assemble a test bench.  It took no more than a minute to connect the wires - the monitor and the wire to connect it took longer to search.  everyone worked on laptops;) The phrase "Reboot and select a boot device or boot drive" has become a balm for the soul - we inserted one of the "working" SSD disks (with Windows 7 on board) - well, that the new computer adopted such an option.

But much more pleasant is completely different - the system works almost silently! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/992/126/b15/992126b156f66ada57993f7ca597d89f.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  The end </h2><br>  You can talk about the result for a long time, but I liked it, as well as all those who have already managed to see it.  Whatever one may say, but in the case of Thermaltake Level 10 I managed to collect more than a productive config that will be relevant for a long time.  Moreover, almost without problems, a ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù water cooling system ‚Äústood up‚Äù, which, in addition to good cooling of the filling, gives +5 to the appearance.  Speaking about the temperature mode, we can safely talk about a solid potential for overclocking - now even in the load, the cooling system works far from the limit of possibilities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a4e/9fb/05c/a4e9fb05ca52c99c24f0bdb1fd78f5ac.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I forgot to write about another important plus - interesting.  Perhaps this is the most interesting thing that I had to do with the glands - not a single computer assembly brought so much pleasure!  One thing is when you collect the usual "soulless" compics, it is quite another thing when you understand all the responsibility and approach the matter with all your soul.  Such work takes not 5 minutes - all this time you feel like a child playing as an adult constructor.  And also the engineer-technologist-designer-plumber-designer, just a geek ... well, the interest is greatly increased! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/82d/755/305/82d75530544c15449d5c376376f090b7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Successes and frosty freshness!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/106394/">https://habr.com/ru/post/106394/</a></p>
