      Since 2009, there has been an "explosive" growth of the agency as a place where advertisers bring their budgets.  Grape has also grown in terms of the complexity of ongoing projects. <br><br>  Fully changed media environment.  For example, it is very difficult to find a person who does not have an account on social networks, although in the early 2000s they were only born.  The boom of smartphones. <br><br>  The most important thing that happened recently is the ‚Äúmobilization‚Äù of the population and the need for advertisers to find new solutions for communicating with consumers. <br><br>  <b>Methods for acquiring and maintaining a pool of loyal customers.</b>  <b>Difference Grape from other digital-agencies.</b> <br><br>  The presence of the name of the agency on the first lines of the rating is, first of all, an indicator of customer confidence.  Grape as an agency makes a certain mix between creative and client service.  Each client has its own specific individual set of tasks.  We are valued for the accumulated experience, knowledge (we have been on the market since 2002) and the possibility of expertise. <br><br>  We release about 100 campaigns per year, dozens of complex high-load sites, applications.  Over the years of searching for key stars in the market, we have assembled a strong team.  This allows us to offer customers the best solutions and achieve the best results. <br><br>  <b>Conservative approach of customers as an obstacle to the development of innovative marketing channels.</b> <br><br>  We work with global offices and global teams.  We help them build relationships. <br>  Now there is a reverse trend - not global, but regional offices.  Russia is becoming an important ‚Äúhub‚Äù for Eastern Europe. <br><br>  <b>Experience in exporting Grape agency services to other countries.</b>  <b>The exit of the Russian market from the role of "catching up" to a more technological and advanced.</b> <br><br>  We regularly receive recognition from Western festivals.  The work of Russian agencies (and our agency in particular) is at the global level.  We travel to key events for the interactive industry.  We see that the work of our agencies is on the same level with the world ones, and we are actively working on cooperation with Western clients. <br><br>  <b>Brands and Mobile.</b>  <b>Global fears of brands in connection with the emergence of new channels of communication and ways to combat them.</b>  <b>Innovative brands and conservative brands.</b> <br><br>  In the event of any new communication channel, there are innovative brands that are important to be first, and conservative brands are ready to try a new communication channel based on the experience of other brands. <br><br>  The main fear of brands is the lack of statistics, when there are no clear data sources.  Since there are no measurements, there are concerns that there is no necessary central channel on a certain channel. <br><br>  Now in mobile every year - more and more tools for measurement.  This helps to ‚Äúsell‚Äù interesting channels from the point of view of the presence of the necessary audience there. <br><br>  Another fear is the lack of a guarantee that the investments of clients will bring the desired effect. <br>  The sooner you start investing in the channel, the faster you understand exactly how it works for your audience and your brand, where the key points of growth.  Those who came first received the first share of attention - it was easier to enter the market. <br>  Advertisers who come later are forced to pay more for the same rates. <br><br>  <b>The first cases of advertisers in the mobile.</b>  <b>Grape experience.</b> <br><br>  We did the same ‚Äúbaby steps‚Äù as everyone else - the first versions of responsive sites, mobile apps. <br><br>  Today, there are several categories that determine the direction of movement of the modern advertising market: automobile manufacturers, banks, FMCG, mobile operators and manufacturers of gadgets. <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúFlyta‚Äù as the basis of ‚Äúthinking‚Äù digital and advertising agencies.</b>  <b>The principles of building long-term communication with a loyal audience.</b> <br><br>  In determining the brand strategy in the mobile space, we register those touch points for which we need to guide the user.  We are developing with the Mobile ready platform - the initial brand asset for the mobile space, which will be further developed after the ‚Äúflytov‚Äù stage.  This is the basic functionality.  For example, a pedometer that will always work. <br>  <b>Stages of development of mobile for various brands.</b> <br><br>  Mobile has passed several stages: ‚Äúmobile ok‚Äù, ‚Äúmobile must‚Äù, ‚Äúmobile first‚Äù (now) and the next stage - ‚Äúmobile only‚Äù. <br>  Now Mobile only is very well visible in startups.  Brands are primarily preferred by mobile first. <br><br>  For a more detailed version of the interview, see our YouTube channel: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/SaNblMKJBoI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhqsyF9WlUReYwmCFE22ipC6w515g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299804/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299804/</a></p>
