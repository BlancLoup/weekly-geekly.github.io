      <b>Tablets are becoming mainstream</b> <br>  Last year, everyone talked about them.  In this all will buy them.  Previously, the choice was limited to iPad (no flash, no camera), Samsung Galaxy Tab (unreasonably expensive) and Chinese (which have enough minuses too), now dozens of high-profile models are coming out, and everyone can choose their own taste and wallet.  In addition, there used to be a shortage of good tablet OS (Android 2.x is too smart, we‚Äôll keep silent about Windows 7) - now Android 3.0 and BlackBerry Tablet OS are presented. <br>  <i>Read more: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/features/tablets-at-ces-2011/">pivot table</a> on Engadget</i> <br><br>  <b>Microsoft is missing the tablet market</b> <br>  Yes, Windows 7 tablets come out - but because of x86 processors they are inferior to competitors in performance and price, and because of the desktop OS they are inferior to competitors in convenience.  MS understands that this is bad, and they are trying to act - but so far all the results have been limited to what CES showed a couple of Windows applications running on ARM processors.  When they are porting the entire system to ARM, it is not known (and there is a suspicion that it‚Äôs not soon, since the dates were not named).  Whether they will make a tablet-oriented interface is unknown (and there is a suspicion that they will not, since the already ported applications have been dragged entirely).  Whether Windows developers will have to rewrite all software under ARM is unknown (and there is a suspicion that they will have to, since they did not say the opposite).  Perhaps, in the end, they will still make an excellent system, but the tablet market is divided now, and it will be much more difficult to enter the already divided one;  at CES, they were expected of something much more ready for release. <br>  <i>Read more: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/01/08/editorial-windows-on-arm-is-a-big-deal-but-its-not-enough-to/">article</a> on Engadget</i> <br><br>  <b>Total domination of Google Android</b> <br>  The system was already popular, but now the scale is getting quite scary.  The most discussed topics of CES are tablets (almost all under Android), the Motorola Atrix smartphone system unit (under Android) and a demonstration of Honeycomb version 3.0 of Android itself.  Partly, this imbalance is caused by the fact that Apple does not come to CES (it is clear that iPad 2 and iPhone sales through Verizon would also be discussed topics), but it seems that in 2011, android tablets can easily bypass iPads, and android phones will increase their detachment from iPhones. <br><br>  <b>4G conquers the USA</b> <br>  Last year, the United States began to actively deploy 4G coverage - now there was a choice from which device to use its benefits: several 4G smartphones were presented at once.  What does this mean for Russia?  Most of these smartphones support LTE technology, and Yota started with WiMAX, but then decided to deploy LTE coverage, but they didn‚Äôt want to give out frequencies, but then gave out, but then selected, but she challenged what they took - well, not I understand if we will have LTE and when.  If it is read by someone more knowledgeable, let him explain in the comments if we should start licking ourselves. <br><br>  <b>3D-TV cease to be a wonder</b> <br>  Last year there was a three-dimensional boom in cinemas (the letters ‚Äú3D‚Äù in the title magically increased the film collections), now the target was at home: 3D-TV is no longer an amazing thing, but a normal phenomenon in the lines of major manufacturers.  However, they are manufactured using different technologies, so far it is not clear to the consumer which is better, and before the market settles, time must pass - I think an explosion of popularity may occur as early as 2012. <br><br>  <b>Electric car - not a luxury, but a means of transportation</b> <br>  Electric transport is not talked about for the first decade, but now it is finally moving from prototype discharge to mass production, and the first ever case when a car was presented at an electronics exhibition occurred at CES: Ford showed the Focus Electric model (should go on sale by the end of the year ).  At the same time, wireless transmission of electricity is developing, so maybe we don‚Äôt have to plug our car into a power outlet.  In addition, the integration of cars with smartphones is developing (the same Ford introduced an application for the MyFord Mobile smartphones), as well as embedded infotainment systems. <br>  <i>Read more: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/01/07/ford-unveils-focus-electric-and-myford-mobile-smartphone-integra/">news</a> on Engadget</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111578/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111578/</a></p>
