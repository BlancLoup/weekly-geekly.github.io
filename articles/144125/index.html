      Oh, impatient reader!  Let me have another lyrical digression on the theme of moral old age, and I will justify your hopes for the practical benefits of this post. <br>  <em>An even more ancient inhabitant of my home is a boombox called SONY.</em>  <em>It was made about 20 years ago.</em>  <em>And 10 years after his birth, I had a desire to give someone a similar device.</em>  <em>Naturally, choosing a gift, I was guided by the technical characteristics of my SONY.</em>  <em>To my great surprise, it turned out that in 10 years the technical thought in this area has not only not advanced, but also degraded.</em>  <em>Some of the ‚Äúmorally young‚Äù analogs of my old man received a signal only in the FM band, not paying attention to the VHF, which is popular in our country, others did not know how to turn off or on, others ... I will not bore you with details.</em>  <em>I did not find the device, at least repeating the functional characteristics of my morally old man.</em> <br><br><h4>  Who needs reliability? </h4><br>  Increasingly, we hear that manufacturers deliberately reduce the reliability of their products in order to increase the frequency of sales.  Moreover, from time to time, there are terrible versions of a worldwide conspiracy of producers, such as, <a href="http://www.pravda-tv.ru/2012/04/19/14262">‚ÄúThe Secret History of the Planned Obsolescence of Things!‚Äù</a> .  I do not trust the conspiracy theories, and I have not met a serious study of the dynamics of the life expectancy of things.  Nevertheless, I am ready to agree that modern gadgets and devices serve less than their ancestors.  But I never agree with the fact that manufacturers do not seek by all available means to increase the reliability of their products.  Moreover, each manufacturer wants to secure a reputation for its products as reliable and durable. <br>  For example, the leading manufacturers of LCD monitors claim 100,000 hours of the life of their products.  <a href="http://plasmatvbuyingguide.com/plasmatv/plasmatv-lifespan.html">‚ÄúWhat then is the plasma service life? ... 12-17 years old - this is my short answer,‚Äù the</a> expert says.  Similar examples can be found on any other commodity topics.  But we will provide this occupation to those whom I did not convince, but for now let's summarize: <b>manufacturers are interested in the reputation of reliability and durability of their products.</b> <br><br><h4>  Championship of veterans </h4><br>  If manufacturers are interested in maintaining a reputation for reliability and durability, they are willing to pay for it.  They still do it by means of PR, but, for the most part, <a href="http://www.lg.com/ru/home-appliances/buyer-guide/lg-inverter-direct-drive.jsp">on their own behalf (LG)</a> , while the most trust comes from the so-called secondary communications - from person to person.  A tool that asserts the reliability and durability of the arguments of the consumers, I propose to create, establishing a "championship of deserved things." <br><br>  On the corresponding Internet resource, you can post a photo of your ‚Äúveteran‚Äù with a small description of a ‚Äúlove story‚Äù similar to the one with which I started this habratopic.  Deserved things will compete in life expectancy and preservation of efficiency, their owners - in the sincerity and soul of the stories, and together - qualify for the prizes of manufacturers who own the trademarks with the names of veterans.  In order to maintain a neutral position in relation to the producers, the resource itself will award winners in absolute qualifications (I hope my Alcatel and I will be among the first in the ‚Äúcell phones‚Äù nomination).  By the way, prizes in absolute offsets may be established by companies not related to manufacturers, but related to reliability and durability - for example, banks or insurance companies. <br>  The veteran status of things does not mean at all that only rare owners will have chances.  While I am writing this article, I have been reading reviews, many of which already have 2-3 year old phones called veterans.  But even if someone has the habit (or misfortune) to change the phone annually, he may well have a refrigerator, a TV set or some other well-deserved equipment as a veteran.  What technology?  And something not killed from Adidas or ECCO?  Without exaggeration, the ‚Äúdeserved thing‚Äù is found in everyone! <br>  In order not to deprive the visitors of the service who found more aged gizmos than their own among the already nominated candidates, estimates for the strength of the story about the thing, full use of functions, preservation of efficiency and maybe something else should be involved in calculating the overall assessment.  The desire to improve their assessment of the story can be a good motive for inviting friends and acquaintances to the service.  The audience should be extensive. <br><br>  I did not find any such service analogs.  If someone tells me, I will be very grateful.  Famous online shopping sites (Yandex-Market, Imkhonet, Irecommend.ru, etc.) are used only during preparatory periods for the purchase and do not create strong motives for the user to return when he has already made a purchase or has cooled off his first impressions of the purchase.  Since manufacturers have little sense of the ratings and mixed descriptions of the advantages and disadvantages of things, there is only one way to monetize existing resources - advertising. <br><br>  The attractiveness of the "championship" will already be enough to monetize the project at the expense of manufacturers' contributions.  But the proposal to the latter will be much more convincing if the service provides statistics on the demand for consumer properties. <br>  To obtain statistics, users of the service will have to distribute 100% of the value of their material goods between the full set of properties - the ‚ÄúUsability‚Äù column in the brief example on the subject of ‚Äúphones‚Äù <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  <b>Consumer property</b> </th><th>  <b>Usability</b> </th><th>  <b>Need</b> </th></tr><tr><td>  Voice communication </td><td>  90% </td><td>  70% </td></tr><tr><td>  Alarm clock </td><td>  6% </td><td>  ten% </td></tr><tr><td>  Text messaging </td><td>  four% </td><td>  0% </td></tr><tr><td>  Calculator </td><td>  0% </td><td>  0% </td></tr><tr><td>  Property "X" </td><td>  0% </td><td>  20% </td></tr></tbody></table>  <em>The purpose of the column "Necessity" - just below.</em> <br><br>  To obtain data on the distribution of customer value for a set of product properties, expensive marketing research is conducted.  Our service will be able to provide data for functional cost analysis in the most natural way. <br><br><h4>  Community Design </h4><br>  For this function, my views are not very specific.  It is clear that for the purposes of "Solaris" service users need to take the formulation of problems that can be solved the proposed innovations.  But how to make this activity interesting and fascinating is not entirely clear. <br>  For example, the task of inventing an alarm clock is being solved, which would not be a <a href="http://f5.ru/planktonmanagich/post/9577">monster</a> , but would not let it oversleep.  Requirements for the future product are stated, evaluated according to a certain procedure, so that their totality gives the alarm clock a combination of tenderness to the bride and the sergeant‚Äôs perseverance, but responds to requests of at least 75% of the participants in the discussion (the percentage may be variable depending on the number of participants).  As a result of the process, a well-formulated inventive problem should appear.  How to make this lesson more exciting than toys in networks? <br><br>  The second task will be consumer expertise of the properties of the proposed innovations.  In this place of my consciousness, even greater ambiguity begins.  I can‚Äôt get to the detailed study of the <a href="http://quirky.com/">QUIRKY</a> technology, and the integral assessment ‚ÄúI would buy at such a price‚Äù - what I saw on the surface is not universal enough.  It is good for the simplest products, and Solaris, if not forgotten, should be able to organize the design of everything, including horror, like the Aero Hydroelectric Station.  An approximate representation consists in combining the estimates in the format of the ‚ÄúNecessity‚Äù column with the data format for functional analysis of the costs and the formulation of the problem in the format of TRIZ methods ... like saying something (do not kill with questions). <br><br>  So, the proposed service consists of two technologically and ideologically related blocks: ‚Äúthe championship of veterans‚Äù and ‚Äúsocial engineering‚Äù.  But the first block can be launched without waiting for complete certainty on the unreasoned questions of the second.  Prior to its launch, there will be enough time to think through all the details and without stopping to take up the completion of the championship of deserved things to the public engineering factory. <br><br><h4>  The first principle of "Solaris" </h4><br>  I foresee bewilderment: why would the author paint remarkable prospects instead of quietly running the project himself?  I will try to explain, starting with a retreat. <br>  Windows is not the first operating system and, as experts say, is not the best.  Google is not the first and not the only search service (Yandex finds many things better in the Russian Federation).  Fasebook is not the first social network and, I‚Äôll add from myself, it is not the best.  But they are the most popular.  Why? <br>  If a rational and comprehensive answer to this ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù Existed, the mentioned services would be the second after those that would be built in accordance with this answer.  Thousands are striving for the same goal, and it‚Äôs better for everyone.  Moreover, I note that pioneers are rarely marked by public attention and endowed with benefits.  That's it.  But this does not mean that it cannot be otherwise. <br><br>  The principle of "the winner gets everything" does not seem to me productive.  The formula ‚Äútalent √ó opportunity = result‚Äù does not work.  At least, I don‚Äôt know a single case where once the ‚Äúreceived everything‚Äù would demonstrate in the following undertakings even greater success, proportionate to the increased opportunities.  This means that all the talents and expanded opportunities of the winning team are subsequently spent on maintaining the status quo or, at best, on charity.  I also did not hear that one of the winners was successful in supporting other promising undertakings. <br><br>  Large systems, by definition, cannot be created by small forces of individuals.  Who invented universities, railways, space, the Internet, finally?  For each of these super-projects, the history counts a different number of names and facts, but the common features between them are the parallelism of development and mutual enrichment.  "Solaris" - a project no less ambitious.  Moreover, it is a megaproject whose mission is to accelerate the launch of other projects, including the prefix "super."  There is no point in launching the project ‚Äúquietly-peacefully‚Äù, since there are no prospects for this way.  But I see remarkable prospects in the joint work of various professionals who will unite around the principle: <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Everybody gets everything</b> that has accepted the goal of the project as their own, and moved towards it the path that seems to them the most faithful. </td></tr></tbody></table><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9b0/584/2bd/9b05842bdecd5f71b5b6f9c4b41dc139.jpg" align="right">  Discharge your mind, take a look at the picturesque picture!  Each of the branches of this apple has chosen its path.  Anyone say which one is the best? <br>  Only one path will lead to the highest point, and let the team who chose this path become the formal winner and get what they deserve.  But the work of all the other teams will bring equally valuable results.  Each of the ways will lead to results that will be evaluated and accepted as a contribution to the achievement of a common goal.  This, if you will, is the philosophy of the tree.  The trunk is the thickest and tallest branch, but without other branches, branches and twigs, the life of a tree is impossible. <br>  And how, you ask, we will consider all our branches and twigs? <br><br>  Do not know yet.  More precisely, there is no simple and ‚Äúonly true‚Äù answer to this question.  Moreover, I myself have many questions that need to be discussed: <br><ul><li>  Are there closer analogues to the proposed service than those mentioned? </li><li>  On which open area can development be organized? </li><li>  Where to quickly find specialists in functional cost analysis and TRIZ? </li><li>  Who can quickly and meaningfully analyze the <a href="http://quirky.com/">QUIRKY</a> public engineering <a href="http://quirky.com/">technology</a> ? </li><li>  Strive to create a unified expert form or create different ones? </li><li>  ... </li></ul><br>  I suggest looking for answers together! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144125/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144125/</a></p>
