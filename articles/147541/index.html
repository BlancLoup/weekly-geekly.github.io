  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Comfort and safety in living conditions or robots in the service of Man</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Artyom was returning from a three-year trip, which he arranged for himself. <br>  Since the military opened one of the previously closed radio channels, an opportunity has emerged for the almost complete coverage of Russia with just 4.5 G, which was done by one of the startups. <br>  Since then, for Artyom there was no point in staying tied to the place and fast Internet: he did not like to sit in one place, and the fast Internet was always with him.  Also with him was his designer laptop boxed assembly.  Viva, creativity! <br>  Artyom our was a jack of all trades, but mostly a designer.  In his free time, this did not prevent him from learning programming, digging in hardware and machines, and reading the Strugatskys.  Artem's girls were permanent, but he did not dare to tie the knot in marriage: he preferred comfort and safety.  He had the money for this; by his 37 years he managed to earn a name for himself known in most of the CIS countries. <br>  Three years ago, he broke down and drove off on his SUV wherever his eyes looked, overwhelmingly overcame the temptation to ride an iron horse.  During these three years, he successfully sold over a thousand photographs, with a hundred articles, a dozen design and concept art, and even two ideas.  The most valuable, he, as always, held for himself and his two best friends, not forgetting, of course, and parents. <br>  And now it is time to return home. <a name="habracut"></a>  The house was new, it was erected before Artyom‚Äôs trip under his guidance.  Considering his motto: ‚ÄúComfort, safety and reliability are the key to happiness,‚Äù it would be logical to assume that Artyom will not pass by the so-called ‚ÄúSmart Home‚Äù.  And so it is: Artem painted the layout himself, the concept of the house and the design of the rooms were also made by him, but he entrusted the rest to the specialists.  He even resisted the temptation to set up the PLC himself.  It is time to try out the new product in action ... <br><habracut> Artyom promised himself nothing to be surprised.  Although the technicians gave the opposite task: "Try to surprise me, but within the framework of the TK."  In the meantime, they surprised him only with the sent receipts ... <br>  Navigator reported that he had about twenty kilometers to go.  Indicator - that the fuel remained at a hundred kilometers maximum.  Communicator saw HSPA-network. <br>  Soon Artem went on the road.  Of course, that the Russian is good, then the German is death ... Here are our road builders and kept stoically roads in case of a new war with the Germans.  But this is all the lyrics. <br>  Here is the penultimate turn, and the observatory turret has already begun to look through the trees.  She glistened in the sun with aluminum sheen. <br>  The last turn and the house seemed.  Not very big, two floors and a basement.  Fenced perforated duralumin fence.  Expensive, but Artyom liked it.  The house itself resembled a spacecraft.  This impression was created by the struts on the ground and the elongated shape of the house.  A message came to the communicator: ‚ÄúGood afternoon, Captain Artem.  The weather is set according to your preferences, coffee is brewed.  Since your last visit (2 years, 11 months, 5 days ago) there have been 4 invasion attempts, the property has not been damaged. ‚Äù <br>  Oh how!  4 attempts.  So Artyom knowingly spent the extra two hundred thousand and installed an active protection system.  It could have been done better, but it would spoil the look, so Artyom decided not to work, and just put airsoft guns, paintball markers, loudspeakers, drives and cameras in four copies.  Now every intruder was fired allegedly from real machine guns with paintball markers.  Simple and tasteful. <br>  Artyom arrived at the gate, which began to open five meters before them.  Artyom first thought about the implementation, but then he remembered that the technicians took his sim card for a while.  This is understandable, not yet surprised.  The garage door also opened automatically with the sound of air being sucked inwards.  The gate was styled as a cargo hold and the speakers only reinforced the impression.  Plus technique, but not surprised. <br>  Coming out of the car, Artem ignored the server's invitation to drink a cup of fresh hot coffee, which came through the intercom system, and went to look at the bike.  His chopper was standing on an inclined podium, which made the impression of the beast even stronger.  And this is not counting the post-apocalyptic photo wallpaper on the walls of this part of the garage. <br>  Artyom returned to the jeep.  He also rose, but the back.  So that you can remove the car from the brake and start the car in the process of driving out of the site.  Too small, but convenient.  Artyom has always believed that the uniqueness of these little things.  Artyom left the garage and headed for the entrance.  The walls were of some shiny metal.  Hot. <br>  The entrance was decorated with a red conveyor belt leading through the lock doors.  Disinfection and, at the request of the owner, watering the guests took place in these doors.  The moving walkway cost Artyom a pretty penny, but from the moment he entered, he no longer regretted it.  The first flap of the airlock opened. <br>  Susi from Mass Effect uttered a disinfection phrase.  Artyom smiled.  Another plus, already more, technicians.  Artyom entered the house.  A five-meter winding corridor with metal hoses for clothes and shoes was waiting for him in front. <br>  This part was framed in the spirit of surrealism with cyberpunk impurities.  Artyom took off his coat, hung up his cloak and walked on.  Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed that the built-in vacuum cleaner started working.  Then Artem waited for a choice: either to the kitchen and then the dining room, or to the bathroom, or to the living room.  Artyom decided to eat more and went to the bathroom. <br>  There was a secret.  After entering the cozy room with a warm floor, soft light and the door closing sensor triggering, the lights were turned off, the air conditioner began to work, whistling fairly, played dark ambient and some horror film was projected onto the door.  All to optimize the process!  But this was the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãArtem and the advantages of the technology did not come. <br>  After emptying his stomach, he headed to the kitchen.  Having set the program for the Universal Kitchen Machine (a combination of a refrigerator, stove and microwave), he went to the dining room.  The kitchen was minimalist: UKM, pneumatic glass chute and transport tape for serving dishes to the dining room.  The last one had coffee on the table. <br>  Artyom sat down, took out a smartphone and again tried to get into the control panel of the house.  That hacking failed again, Artem only realized when he had a stew and a glass of wine in front of his nose. <br>  Artyom leaned back slightly on the bar stool, sat down and walked over to the control panel.  In a couple of touches, he chose music.  At first I wanted to put Mozart, but then decided to include a standard playlist for the kitchen.  Something has played.  Artyom turned up the volume.  "The men ate the meat."  Light smirk on the face of Artem.  Plus one. <br>  Artyom sat down again and began to eat.  Then he went to the living room and was about to take a nap.  As soon as he lay down on the sofa and picked up the console, the curtains closed, the screen went out and a suggestion was made to choose a category from the media center.  Artyom chose a dream.  This time Mozart played. <br>  Artem woke up after ten hours.  As he slept in clothes, and even on a not-quite-designed sofa, he decided to change his clothes first and finish the acquaintance, and then take a bath.  Artem climbed to the second, residential floor.  Looked into the office.  Table in the form of a captain's cabin control.  Cabinet opposite, on the contrary, was stylized antique.  Next is Artyom‚Äôs private room.  He asked her not to describe her and therefore I will tell you only about the secret room and the special rope ladder.  They are there. <br>  Artem came out in shorts and a t-shirt.  Old clothes, with the help of another pneumatic drive, was sent to the washing machine.  Artyom went to the "test".  It was a special room with special equipment, where Artem loved to play around with new toys.  He was not a geek, but was obsessed with cyberpunk and fiction. <br>  Artem climbed to the attic.  Ordinary restroom.  Above - the observatory, but Artyom was already in the same and decided not to waste time.  He went downstairs, ordering toast and coffee in the workshop.  In the meantime, it began to grow light and the house reduced the lighting, replacing it with natural.  However, it was visible only to the server and reading logs. <br>  Artyom chose to use his stairs, which led him to those.  room at the very beginning of the basement.  There was a bunch of distribution panels, a boiler, hubs, a server in an armored vehicle ... In general, the heart of the house, absolutely not remarkable for a casual observer.  Artyom knew that he could not stay here for five minutes, at least for half a day, and therefore decided to go further.  Ahead was a technical pit under the garage with auto service equipment.  Next - another effective dignity.  a knot, then a jacuzzi and inconspicuous rooms for automatic washing and ironing. <br>  Unfortunately, Artyom could not find a robot that would transfer the washed things to the ironing board and from there load them into a transport pneumatic drive ... Industrial robots were not affordable for Artyom so far.  Therefore, we had to do everything manually. <br>  Artyom went first to the sport, then to the billiard room, touched the table, looked at his collection of cold arms and went to the workshop.  Breakfast.  In the workshop there was a huge table around the perimeter and a pile of tools.  From the screwdriver to the electron microscope.  For Artyom, this was the second most important place after the techno-cabinet.  Then there was a bar, then an old school room, those.  room, billiard room, observatory, private bedroom and further on the list. <br>  Here Artem worked with his hands, not his brain.  In the workshop he had three computers.  Old stump, middle core2 and top i9.  All access terminals scattered around the house were connected with the latter (not to be confused with control panels!).  Artyom worked on it and sometimes played with friends in third characters.  The first two were intended for running the code of Artyom, which he sometimes wrote.  Also in the workshop there was a large table for drawings and a folding bed, remaining from student days. <br>  His office and workshop were designed so that he could not leave from there to do whatever he wanted.  Only for help had to walk six meters.  Food, drinks, temperature, air, music and everything else, thanks to augmented reality, was available in almost every room in the house. <br>  Artyom looked at the workshop, sadly sighed, and headed to those.  room, learn the server to recognize its commands and be friends with all its gadgets.  And still it is necessary to customize the scenarios for yourself ... Well, we will not distract Artyom, he will have to work all day and continue on.  After all, it was interesting to you, thanks to whom the concept of the ‚ÄúCity of the Future‚Äù was lobbied? <br><br>  Comments: <br>  0. The cost of such a house, depending on the equipment, decoration and design, can vary from ten to about two hundred million rubles at the moment.  The estimated cost of the house described is within forty million rubles. <br>  1. Artyom took into account all his pluses and rewarded technicians. <br>  2. The concept of the house was born long ago, with the beginning of acquaintance with automated systems.  Since now I am engaged in the development of a smart home for myself - I decided to write, all of a sudden anyone is interested. <br>  3. If really interesting - I can share the remaining links. <br>  <a href="http://forum.ixbt.com/topic.cgi%3Fid%3D82">forum.ixbt.com/topic.cgi?id=82</a> : 984 <br>  <a href="http://ab-log.ru/">ab-log.ru</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.mini-server.ru/">www.mini-server.ru</a> (what would not bother with software) <br>  4. Reference to the City of the Future - reference to my work.  According to one of the city planners: the language is terrible, but the ideas are correct.
