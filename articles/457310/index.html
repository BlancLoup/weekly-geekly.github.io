  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Biology of information dependence. Part one</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The founder of Instagram: - ‚ÄúPeople have always been visuals - our brain processes images better.  A letter is not natural for a person.  In Instagram, we return to what is most natural.  Instagram has always been a communication platform, not a tool for sharing images.  Instagram‚Äôs built-in feedback systems help users continually improve their communication skills. ‚Äù  I will clarify, I do not argue about anything vehemently, here is just a by-product of brain activity, I am always glad to disputes!  Let's do unnatural things, drove. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/22d/7b6/b32/22d7b6b32219ac655eac87446c83e166.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>As always something against the background of something</i> <br><br>  Sapiens from the cohort ‚Äúeconomists‚Äù have made most of the matter in our universe a commodity.  From the territory, oil, coal, plants, water saturated with hydrogen, heights (the ferris wheel is just selling heights) to forecasts, lectures, relics of saints, sensations, faith (stocks, stocks are the degree of faith in a company).  There remained only two entities that economists could not translate into the category of economic product.  This is a vacuum and attention.  Until the vacuum has not reached, but with attention, like, figured out!  Here is the biology side.  Small informative excursion: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1) The key sensory modalities of sapiens are vision (most developed) and hearing (second in importance).  This implies that the brain prefers information flows from these very systems!  A brief example. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Information from different sensory systems is processed at different speeds.  Visual information weighs more than aural information and therefore it takes longer to process.  But all information is fed simultaneously and synchronously.  If you want to make sure of this, then just clap your hands now, are the picture and sound simultaneous?  paradox, yes?  The brain delays some information, waiting for the download of the remaining sequences, so formally, you live in the past, darling.  That is why sprints use a shot, rather than a visual signal, the sound is processed faster.  It is important to clarify that even though the information is presented simultaneously, but for some threads, the brain may give less preference to assess the situation!  For example, if it smells of burning, but other sensory systems do not see evidence of this, then the brain can simply omit this fact.  This globally affects our behavior, we prefer it to vision and hearing.  So, the methods of analyzing and processing information themselves are sharpened specifically for these sensory systems! <br><br>  2) The role of dopamine!  Here Robert Sapolsky will help (I recommend his books to everyone: ‚ÄúWhy zebras have no ulcers‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe biology of good and evil‚Äù).  In a very simplified way, dopamine helps you feel happy and motivated.  Many people think that dopamine is released when the brain receives a reward, but dopamine is actually released in anticipation of a reward.  The peculiarity is also in the fact that if you add not 100% probability of receiving the reward, but make it 50%, then another expectation is added and the amount of dopamine increases at times! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b94/477/6c2/b944776c2ac02f5a2b3b4c5f405cbe08.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>When you offered to be together, and she said "maybe"</i> <br><br>  3) How do drugs work?  Narcotic drugs mainly affect the dopamine system.  If you constantly stimulate the dopamine system to produce dopamine through drugs (coffee, nicotine, Naruto, Putin), then over time the brain gets used and turns off the natural production of dopamine, because it knows that the stimulation will happen anyway.  That is why it is hard to quit smoking, there are no external incentives, the internal production system is turned off and some time is needed for recovery (recovery time is from one to three weeks).  About the effect of diminishing returns from doses, it makes no sense to say, and so everyone knows. <br><br>  4) How drugs affect behavior.  A narcotic substance very rarely creates a completely new behavior, usually it reinforces an existing one.  Have you ever noticed that the body reacts to alcohol from time to time in a new way?  The popular myth that alcohol causes aggression is a lie.  Alcohol does not cause aggressive behavior; it only reinforces the tendency that already exists.  You sit drinking merry and after three glasses you will joke even more, and if you were sad, then most likely there will be tears.  Naturally, there are exceptions, but in most cases, narcotic substances only reinforce what really exists! <br><br>  Minute of biology is over!  Such conclusions, vision and hearing decide, dopamine inspires us (maybe), drugs only strengthen, but do not create!  Let's see what happens with social media and digital space! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/72f/e2b/a80/72fe2ba804e2380057e27159f22c15d7.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Why save the Belarusian village if you can let it die?</i> <br><br>  Yesterday Mary Micker gave a <a href="https://thebell.io/internet-po-meri-miker-razbor-glavnyh-onlajn-trendov-2019-goda/">report</a> that describes the state of things in the digital universe, the following figures are very interesting there: China and its 817 million mobile Internet users are a model for the development of many markets.  The Chinese watch vidosikov for 600 million hours every day, this is their main content (we probably see DNA in our eyesight and love for pictures).  Sapiens go online more and more, Americans spend 6.3 hours in digital devices, 3.6 hours behind a smartphone (the same pictures are straight from a piece of plastic, it‚Äôs a pity that you can‚Äôt download directly to the brain). <br><br>  In cell phones stuck more than in TV (226 minutes against 216).  Most of all grow instagram and YouTube.  The second largest segment is podcasts (hearing, probably hurt, he is even here in the role of a follower, but soon we will all become blind and he will recoup).  In the USA, the audience has doubled in 4 years and has become equal to 70 million. Why we need podcasts when there is a radio, I could not understand.  Voice assistants and podcasts grow faster than consumption and text input. <br><br>  The trend is such that sapiens move to pictures and sounds, which is quite logical from our biology.  And it's also cool that we just went with the social appearance, maybe we are cooler than ants, which means that we have developed role-playing games and we love to play!  That confirmed the report.  2.4 billion sapiens play or consume interactive entertainment in digital spaces.  Information overload is a huge problem, 28% of adult Americans ‚Äúalmost constantly‚Äù (it doesn‚Äôt say how many minutes it is) were online.  In the age group of 18‚Äì29, the same indicator was 39%.  The very effect of diminishing the benefits of doses as they are consumed works in such a way that you need to consume more each time, so as to reach at least the same level of pleasure.  Now back to the founder of instagram and his words!  Let's think what it all means! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/452/78b/2fe/45278b2feda429a833e1d8ba59c70f6d.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>When I decided to get stuck and download erotic vidosik on a smartphone</i> <br><br>  Every three minutes a person touches a smartphone.  Every six minutes, it opens any application.  This is + -360 touches per day.  In search of unique and, consequently, the most valuable resources, companies have repeatedly demonstrated their ingenuity in the history of capitalism.  From the industrial revolution, which was based on the chemical and physical achievements of science, to the Internet of things, where objects from the real world become participants in dynamic communication systems along with sapiens.  Information becomes the main participant and engine of the fourth technological revolution and cyberpunk.  Cybernetics and computer science are at their peak, but what will happen next?  How far will the companies go?  Or have they already logged in?  They felt the most valuable resource that exists in these conditions of the outside world.  This resource is our attention. <br><br>  Playing with the biology of human behavior and its behavioral addictions is what many companies are doing now.  Going into any application, you can see a few notifications, but you can not see.  Uncertainties have always attracted individuals of the species, pulling them into the game.  The variable rewards in the form of ‚ÄúI like‚Äù social approvals are carried away.  And there is still this effect "maybe."  Sapiens spends "inside" the network more and more time, and if and while he is there, you can twist ads and monetize his attention.  Behind the involvement in online communication are exactly the coins, as in any business.  The desire to increase profits - the normal behavior of a commercial structure.  But it is important to understand the price that each human and society as a whole pays for the profits of companies.  Play with biology and set him on an informational drug, using his weaknesses (love of pictures and songs of the CPSU)?  I'm against! <br><br>  How do companies manipulate attention and make people spend more and more time online?  Everything, according to the biology described above.  Crush on visual and rumor, all content is now directed to this.  The crush on the social nature and the fear of being alone (we are all alone, otherwise Jean Paul Sartre does not understand anything).  Crush on the game and role-playing excitement.  Boredom in modern society is a clear problem and companies are solving it.  In one psychological experiment, people preferred to beat themselves with a current, just not to sit for 20 minutes alone with their thoughts.  In this regard, acquaintance with content or correspondence is a more pleasant leisure than current. <br><br>  All this is supported by the ability to pursue numerical goals.  Reasonable, constantly challenging themselves.  Make 100 squats more, earn $ 2,000.  more than my friend.  Applications make it possible to measure micro goals numerically, which means they give an opportunity for micro wins as well.  This time, a Facebook profile photo has collected 40 likes, which is 5 more than the previous one.  The next one should be even cooler.  And now he is absorbed in the process.  It is inside the web, and if it becomes boring, just go to another application and repeat the process.  The most amazing thing is that when you get tired of this, you can offer sapiens to become a content generator and make you glad about your own project (micro-victories (dopamine) and uncertainty from ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù right there), keeping it inside! <br><br>  The creators of applications, content and advertisers in these moments look like a duck bathing in gold coins.  But in fact - they are all dependency providers.  And those who sell dependencies today, once, at the start of sales were confident that they were doing a good job.  From drug dealers, nicotine and alcohol dealers to micro-victories, entertainment and expectations.  New nothing! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/457310/">https://habr.com/ru/post/457310/</a></p>
