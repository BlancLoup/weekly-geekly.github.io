  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why I do not use the Mobile Bank service from Sberbank</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We live after all in the 21st century.  We have become <s>more better to dress</s> many things to do through the Internet.  For example, very few of my friends would think of buying a ticket somewhere without looking at the information on routes and possible prices.  If someone himself can not, then ask someone who can.  And most likely they will immediately buy via the Internet.  Before you buy at least a pump, first they shovel the internet.  Buying something from an online store has become easier than choosing something from real stores.  And often cheaper. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a12/35e/8a8/a1235e8a8f914f4ea9b6395a38c95650.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Banks are not far behind the population and offer various services such as Mobile banking, Tele-banking, Internet banking and others.  Naturally, there were various applications for smartphones and tablets (which is often the same).  You can find out the balance in the account, replenish the balance of the phone, transfer money and so on, lightly bothering yourself, right in the shuttle bus. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I have been a Sberbank client for a very long time.  As a child, my parents brought me a passbook and put 1000 rubles on it so that when I was 18 I could ... I do not even know what they were guided by and so I thought they could.  I don‚Äôt know how much they hoped for, but a couple of years ago I received about 3,000 rubles on this account.  I do not even remember how much.  Distracted ... Like a normal modern person, I have a debit card.  And so it happened that she sberovskaya.  Previously, she had a salary, but now she has to pay for something somewhere.  But I do not use the Mobile Bank service, but use the good old one-time passwords printed on the check.  And all because the scammers, like all of us, also went into the 21st century and also use modern technologies.

      There are several options for withdrawing funds from the population, which I know. <br><br><h4>  Option one.  Gone </h4><br>  There are people who still use the ancient Sims.  On these sims you can make a duplicate.  This is usually done to talk at the expense of someone else.  But sometimes scammers get lucky and they get on the number tied to the "Mobile Bank".  Next thing a few minutes.  Money from the card account is transferred to the number of any phone, from there to another phone, and from there to Qiwi-wallet, from which it is already to some virtual account.  Tracking the chain is difficult even for employees of the authorities. <br><br><h4>  Option two.  We buy / sell </h4><br>  A year ago, this method worked well.  Someone sells something over the Internet.  Stamps by mail or notebook handmade.  Calls (or writes by mail) someone.  ‚ÄúI am buying!  Immediately a lot!  Sber?  Fine!  I have just too.  Speak your full name and card number ... ‚ÄùAfter receiving the number, the scammers call the Sberbank‚Äôs call center:‚Äú I‚Äôve had a phone change, I want to tie it to the Mobile Bank.  My name is such and such.  But I do not remember my passport details right now.  And the old phone is still in hand. ‚Äù  Further, the girl-operator offers to carry out some small transaction on the client‚Äôs account, and the client will tell you what amount was highlighted in the SMS alert.  The SMS comes to the seller that 1 ruble 47 kopecks was withdrawn on his account.  At this time, the scammer calls the seller and says: ‚ÄúI was thinking, suddenly the card number was inaccurate and sent a small amount.  How many did it come? ‚ÄùThe seller says:‚Äú 1 ruble 47 kopecks, but did not come, but was withdrawn. ‚ÄùThey reassure him:‚Äú Yes, this is something Sber confused ... ‚ÄùImmediately the number that went through the transaction is called the operator on the phone, what does it tie the new phone number to the merchant card account.  Then everything happens as in the first version.  Money disappears. <br><br>  Today I talked with the operator of the Sberbank call center.  They ask for the name, registration, the last 4 digits of the card, the code word (but if you don‚Äôt know it, it usually rolls the passport number), registration.  Perhaps strengthened control. <br><br><h4>  Option three.  Hacker </h4><br>  This option is warned <a href="http://www.sberbank.ru/ru/person/dist_services/warning/warning">on the site Cbera</a> .  Today, according to this scenario, money was withdrawn from one of my close friends.  It has Mobile Bank enabled and data transfer is always enabled.  Yesterday night he received an SMS with the data on the balance of his card.  He was surprised that in the morning he called the Sberbank.  They said that you requested, the system answered - all the rules.  And then I would start to sound the alarm, but he, it seems, somehow did not think.  Tonight, his phone requested a balance and received a response from the Sberbank system.  Then the phone sent a request to transfer money to the left number.  Received a code with a request to confirm the transaction and answered it.  The money is gone.  But the hackers were decent.  They took not everything, but left some small amount in the account.  The victim, of course, wrote a statement to the Sberbank, but there they will consider the application for 45 days and they will definitely need to write a statement to the police. <br><br>  Why do I mention Sber?  Because he has the easiest to carry out such operations.  And scammers use it.  And it‚Äôs about the fact that money was stolen from Sberbank‚Äôs accounts, I know, but others haven‚Äôt been told to me yet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0dd/cc6/974/0ddcc69741ee4350965487a276c4b140.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is for this reason that from the very beginning I do not use the ‚ÄúMobile Bank‚Äù from Sberbank.  Yesterday was the first time you had to take advantage.  The fact is that one-time passwords from a check can be operated with amounts not exceeding 3,000 rubles.  And I had to make a purchase on 3995. I naively wanted to turn on the service through the site, make a payment and turn it off.  But Sbert disagrees.  I ordered the service through the site, but only activated it today, when I no longer needed it.  I wanted to turn off the service, but it turns out that you cannot turn it off via the website.  You need to either come to the service office, or call.  Moreover, the answering machine offers to go through the branches so intricately that you have a combination: dial the number 88005555550, as soon as the answering machine is triggered, dial 3 2 0. The girl-operator attempted to dissuade the service from shutting down, insisting that the Security Service of the bank is fighting fraudsters and the situation when money is stolen from me, in principle, it is impossible only if I do not give SMS codes to someone.  Insisted on disconnecting.  I requested a bunch of information, after which I sent an SMS with a code that I sent to number 900 (that is, a reply to the incoming SMS) I sent a request to deactivate the Mobile Bank service.  It took more than 3 hours, and the service is still not disabled. <br><br>  Although the 21st century, but they still steal ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365811/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365811/</a></p>
