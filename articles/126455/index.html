  <section class="page js-page"><h1>7 reasons to suffer the customer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Customer webmaster necessary and useful.  However, often even the most relaxed customer wants to send him on a long journey with the best wishes, or even to be assaulted.  For the sake of observance of the Criminal Code, propriety and preservation of one‚Äôs own nerves and budgets, it‚Äôs worth remembering that there are several ‚Äúconsumer behavior patterns‚Äù that need to be able to neutralize.  Here they are: <br><br>  <b>1) So, I do not know what ...</b> <br>  Problem: The person who came with the request ‚ÄúMake me a website‚Äù usually does not know what he wants.  What is the technical task there - usually everything is limited to the words "well, just a website" or "but I saw on the Internet, I am the same ...".  And you need to explain to a person why a regular business card site will be inferior to a multimedia portal in terms of the amount and cost of work. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Solution: Insist on filling out the brief BEFORE meeting at any cost. <br><br>  <b>2) Are you a customer, am I a fool?</b> <br>  Problem: Despite the fact that the customer does not represent what exactly he needs, he is most often sure of the opposite.  Even if he is not able to make a TZ normally - in every detail he is just a specialist, a maestro, a guru, Jobs and Gates in one person.

      Solution: To offer solutions in such a way that it would seem to the customer that you are just developing his brilliant idea.  Use questions like: ‚ÄúWhat if we do this?‚Äù <br><br>  <b>3) Appetite comes with eating.</b> <br>  Problem: The customer is not aware that because of the changes, it is often necessary to redo much of the work again.  And his appetite is growing from the initial ‚Äújust a site‚Äù; he quickly moves on to the need to add one, the other, the third. <br><br>  Solution: Sign not only the contract, but also the TK (as an integral annex to the contract). <br><br>  <b>4) From IT to Russian</b> <br>  Problem: The customer and the developer speak most often in languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat correspond in much the same way as Spanish and Portuguese: the sounds seem to be the same, but you still cannot do without a translator.  Computer slang doesn‚Äôt say anything to the client (even if he is a smart guy, don‚Äôt believe), so everything needs to be explained literally by syllables. <br><br>  Solution: From the very beginning, ask the question ‚ÄúWhy do you need a website?‚Äù Five times in a row.  In this way, you find out how the client‚Äôs goal actually sounds in his language.  And implement it, not ‚Äúphishing‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>5) This is the sweet word "freebie"</b> <br>  Problem: The customer, like any human being, is a creature driven by three basic instincts: self-preservation, reproduction and free navigation.  I mean, he seeks to pay for work as little as possible, or even not to pay at all.  In fact, it seems that all the people who are used to shopping in the markets and bargaining for every penny there have decided to implement their passion in the web to bring down prices and tariffs. <br><br>  Solution: Better 1 client, but rich than 10 poor. <br><br>  <b>6) The developer is always extreme</b> <br>  Problem: It is clear to us, the developers, that we are not magicians and we are not even going to learn this.  And the customer believes that if his site does not perform its task (does not gain the necessary attendance by itself and does not transfer money to the account), then it is the web developer who is to blame. <br><br>  Solution: At the first meeting, offer related services - starting with basic SEO and context, and continuing with web analytics and SMM.  If the client refuses, then we make only the site in working condition, and we are not responsible for anything else. <br><br>  <b>7) Client or portfolio</b> <br>  Problem: The developers, I must admit, are not without a mote in the eye either: often the web-studio creates a website not so much for solving business problems of a specific client, but for implementing their own creative ideas.  Satisfaction of professional ambitions is, of course, good, but the interests of the customer must remain in priority. <br><br>  Solution: Agree with the client in advance that this will be a case project.  In many cases, it even adds value to you as an expert! <br><br>  Please your customers, and you will be rewarded - in cash equivalent! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126455/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126455/</a></p>
