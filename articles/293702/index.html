And almost all the time of its existence, there was a " <b>swing effect</b> ": sales were good, then just disgusting.  And it was impossible to write off these fluctuations for seasonality - it is present in our market, but does not play a significant role.

      It was clear that the main reason is <b>how we sell</b> , and <b>with what intensity we sell</b> . <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Therefore, the task was to <b>standardize</b> the sales process.  To specific actions brought the <b>predicted result</b> . <br><br>  And they decided to start with the most stressful and unpleasant for the internal sales department of the occupation - <b>cold calls</b> .  The organization of this process for us has become the <b>number one task</b> .  And we turned to a professional call center. <br><br>  And the persistent and painstaking work of ‚Äúprescribing‚Äù customer interaction began: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/831/8b2/339/8318b233935c42b9871c07b4bc1fff03.png"><br><br><ul><li>  how to properly greet; </li><li>  how to ‚Äúget around‚Äù the secretary; </li><li>  how to talk about the product, about the key benefits; </li><li>  what questions to ask the client to reveal the need, etc.  etc. </li></ul><br><br>  The work was not easy - although the specialists from the call center did most of the work, they themselves also had <b>to take an active part</b> . <br><br>  But, to be honest, we ourselves were surprised at how <b>strong</b> our <b>product is</b> .  At this stage, we got the script and run the project. <br><br>  Girls from the call center began to ring up customers - the first inquiries began to come.  Of course, the conversations were not immediately perfect - in the first couple it was necessary to <b>listen to each conversation</b> , make changes to the text, research the best and worst practices: ‚ÄúWhen customers‚Äú send ‚Äù, and when they <b>show a lively interest</b> ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca0/169/3df/ca01693df8194616abac8ef218c6b2fa.jpg"><br><br>  As a result, after a week of work, the girls from the call center began to talk about the product better and more concisely than our managers, and even myself. <br><br>  It is clear that when it came to a substantive discussion of the problem, it touched on technical nuances - we had to connect.  But for this we are experts in our field. <br><br>  In the bottom line, what we received after the implementation of the call center: <br><br><ol><li>  Steadily, about <b>42% of</b> potential customers after call-ups <b>show interest</b> , leave an email and ask to send a commercial offer. </li><li>  <b>4-5% immediately apply</b> with a specific request. </li><li>  Their <b>managers are exempt</b> from finding new customers.  Now their task is to <b>efficiently process applications</b> and lead the client. </li><li>  Now we have a switch ‚ÄúHow many new applications we want to receive‚Äù.  That is, we <b>can adjust our download</b> . </li></ol><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb4/e18/d61/eb4e18d61c6e481c99f153751177fb51.png"><br><br>  <i>I would like to ask you readers a question on this topic:</i> <br><ol><li>  Did you have experience connecting a call center in your company?  What were the difficulties? </li><li>  Used the services of third-party services, or organized your department? </li><li>  How were the conversation scripts composed and perfected? </li><li>  Did you manage to go to the decision makers in most cases? </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293702/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293702/</a></p>
