      And what does the computer security industry do against these cyber attack methods?  Yes, almost nothing new, states Bilby, all the same poor and inefficient old tools.  In his opinion, the sellers of such solutions simply ‚Äúpush magic‚Äù by hanging noodles on the ears of naive buyers. <br><br>  What, in fact, offers us a classic antivirus?  In the overwhelming majority of file scanners for virus detection by signature and heuristic analyzer for files against which the scanner is powerless (for example, compressed or encrypted).  Each of these methods has its own advantages and disadvantages, but in general, Bilby is right, outdated technology has been used for many years, and on the other hand, it is also quite difficult to offer something fundamentally new.  But you can.  For example, over the past decade, sandboxes have been developed, but they haven‚Äôt earned much attention for certain reasons, perhaps due to maintenance difficulties, because the mass solution should be simple as a frying pan and reliable as scrap.  Everything ingenious is simple, though not everything simple is ingenious. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The virus does not appear on the computer from where it does not take, it comes to visit with the file downloaded from the Internet or received by mail.  That is, ‚Äúthere was a file first‚Äù and nothing but a file, and the spirit of the virus resides in it and waits for this file to be launched in order to start the winning march and ‚Äúfulfill the will of the one who sent me.‚Äù <br><br>  It turns out that any new file is potentially dangerous and protecting yourself from new files will protect you from viruses.  But if we talk about a spherical computer in a vacuum, in real life it is impossible to protect oneself from new files, for the reason that creating new files is a natural process of computer functioning.  Hence, from the whole mass of files, it is necessary to somehow select the "bad", potentially dangerous. <br><br>  Certainly, only those that are capable of launching can be classified as virus files;  executable or interpretable.  It is understandable, what is the use of the virus lying in a text file?  Evil should work, not peacefully snuffle in temporary folders. <br>  For example, you downloaded the game and want to play it, but when you start the "game" suddenly begins to create other executable files and place them in the startup section.  On the face of the actions of a malicious character, it is necessary as soon as possible to nip them at the root and the invasion will end without even starting.  This is what a modern antivirus should offer - preventive protection that will protect against the virus, encryptor, trojan, worm ... and anything. <br><br>  But at the same time, it is not necessary to forbid everything and everyone to the right and left, since for the normal operation of the operating system it also needs to create files, and sometimes even executables.  And since the operating system is not a priori infected, it is possible to trust the work of all its mechanisms, it makes no sense to check what is created by its means.  This also includes software products of famous (and not so) brands that you trust, i.e.  exclude from the scan "trusted programs" obtained from reliable sources. <br><br>  So, what happens is that to protect against the threat, there is no need to scan and analyze anything; you need a solution that restricts operations on certain files in certain places, since  It is logical to assume that for the ‚Äúwork‚Äù the virus will select an available temporary folder, and not the root directory of Windows.  Well, it‚Äôs nice to be able to exclude trusted applications from scanning. <br><br>  It would seem that the solution lies on the surface, but for some reason, there are practically no popular blocking programs among mastodons, therefore, applications that are currently little known to the general public, but despite this, do an excellent job with this task. <br><br>  Today I want to introduce you to the most interesting products in my opinion that meet the requirements described above, these are VoodooShield from the American company VoodooSoft, SecureAPlus from the Singapore-based SecureAge Technology, and also the Russian Defendset from the Krasnoyarsk company VTB.  Initially, I managed to find another Russian program - the St. Petersburg Protection System Pantsir, unfortunately the demo version of Pantsir could not be downloaded, the developers require you to send a special form on the company's letterhead, stamped with the company and signed by the responsible person.  Since I have no organization, no forms, no printing, we could not include this product in the review, which is a pity.  Perhaps in the future it will be possible to get this utility, but for now let's look at today's participants and examine what they are, and most importantly, how to cope with the stated tasks. <br><br><h1>  <font color="#3693da">VoodooShield</font> </h1><br>  VoodooShield is a utility that blocks the launch of new applications and unknown objects that may contain malware.  Before installing, it is important to make sure that there are no malicious objects on the computer; otherwise, they can be added to the number of trusted objects and will function completely officially. <br><br>  The product is available in two versions - free, with limited settings and full-featured, at a price of $ 19.99 per year.  Product site: <a href="https://voodooshield.com/">https://voodooshield.com</a> <br><br>  The installation process of the antivirus itself is quite familiar; after the welcome window appears and before the installation is completed, the user does not have to take any action. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/287/b76/30e/287b7630e8a142b3ae028e9dc17f8efe.png"><br><br>  Immediately after installation, the program offers to choose in which mode the protection should be performed.  "Autopilot" provides the program itself to assess the level of danger of applications being launched, and the "White List" ensures the launch of only those applications that are included in this list. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Mode selection window</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/77b/046/276/77b0462769344d869651c9019acf5941.png"><br></div></div><br>  The first launch of the program is accompanied by a small educational program on its use, explaining exactly how the protection will be implemented. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Instructions for work</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ce3/43d/2fd/ce343d2fd6f84d98ab49b4d7fc29a8b1.png"><br></div></div><br>  A control widget is displayed near the system tray, with which you can turn protection on and off, as well as use the context menu to change operational settings. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Control widget</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e73/8fb/fe1/e738fbfe16f445c5b7e6a3e1c22e1678.png"><br></div></div><br>  Changing the settings of the program is available in the version of "pro", the free option offers to be content with what is, however, this is quite enough to block unknown files. <br><br>  Basic and advanced settings provide tuning applications for themselves to make the operation of the application more comfortable. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Basic settings</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ff7/2ee/890/ff72ee8909c7442195aa0da69aa2f077.png"><br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Advanced settings</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/814/74f/639/81474f639fcb48289c77b8c67a5577ca.png"><br></div></div><br>  Predefined Internet applications, work with which puts the protection in the desired mode. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Application setup</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/370/5b9/a2b/3705b9a2b3c846d38b35db2661b41f88.png"><br></div></div><br>  "White list" of trusted applications, which can be filled automatically or manually. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">White list</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/658/79a/5c9/65879a5c95af45f88d7825ab72d8dafc.png"><br></div></div><br>  In order that the user does not have to suffer the first time, adding all his installed applications to the white list, the developers have provided the Training mode, which adds all the running processes to the white list.  After working in this mode for several days, you will receive a setting in which all daily used applications will be included. <br><br>  Let's now see how the program functions and fulfills its direct responsibilities.  For this purpose, download the Yandex browser and try to install it on a test computer. <br><br>  Downloading the file did not cause any problems, but launching the new application is accompanied by a blocking notification. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Blocking Notification</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/5a5/5d6/3c4/5a55d63c4a85451c8e2f6d61f59cb468.png"><br></div></div><br>  Clicking on the notification opens the action selection panel - block or run in the local or Internet sandbox Cuckoo. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Choice of action</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/028/075/93b/02807593b4694e789f2837a814025d17.png"><br></div></div><br>  Blocking prevents the execution of the application being launched, and launching it in the local sandbox unfortunately leads to the crash of the application. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Error message</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/5fb/7b4/9da/5fb7b49da734496d97055a65dcf6127d.png"><br></div></div><br>  Run the protection again and try to install the browser.  When choosing an action, select the launch in the Cuckoo sandbox. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Cuckoo sandbox</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1cb/69d/532/1cb69d5322364ae99af3b682317ad51d.png"><br></div></div><br>  Downloading a file and analyzing it takes quite a long time, on the order of several minutes, after which the cuckoo announces its verdict - 7.9 points on a ten-point scale of danger, the application is harmful. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Analysis result</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/05d/d13/175/05dd131750c74b76a4d437a6e6de2f9e.png"><br></div></div><br>  All actions are recorded in the log. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Event log</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/654/37f/698/65437f69824841ddbaaa4ef42f8fbab3.png"><br></div></div><br>  A separate section stores the executed command line, with the help of which objects were launched, which is convenient for analyzing the parameters passed to the application. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Command line log</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e3f/825/918/e3f8259185f5463e93466e5cf3a934fb.png"><br></div></div><br>  VoodooShield is quite easy to use, but at the same time a very effective tool in combating various threats.  The application has some rough edges, but considering that the program can be used completely free of charge, this is quite a worthy option that will allow you to control any malicious objects that attempt to penetrate the computer. <br><br><h1>  <font color="#3693da">Secureaplus</font> </h1><br>  SecureAPlus advanced antivirus from the company SecureAge.  The application combines tools for monitoring and detecting threats in real time with the functions of analyzing suspicious objects and using as many as 12 third-party anti-virus engines. <br><br>  When you install the product, developers generously offer a free annual license, but after a year the license will have to pay $ 2 per month or $ 22.5 per year.  Product site: <a href="https://www.secureaplus.com/">https://www.secureaplus.com</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/df9/62f/c52/df962fc523e54756bc16e95daccc256d.png"><br><br>  Immediately after installation, the user is prompted to perform a system scan, based on the results of which a list of trusted applications will be created, as well as information about objects with not very good reputation (if any will be detected). <br><br>  The program icon is displayed in the system tray, through the context menu you can perform standard operations - open the setting, select the current operation mode. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Application context menu</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3f8/e93/955/3f8e939556e14c79bf8945d99cb1f43a.png"><br></div></div><br>  SecureAPlus can operate in the following modes - Interaction, Blocking, and Trust All.  The names reflect the essence of the selected mode - "Interaction" every time asks the user to trust or not the unknown application, "Block" automatically blocks unknown suspicious objects that are not on the white list, "Trust all" allows any processes to work. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Mode selection</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a4a/9f8/4dc/a4a9f84dcb35457fa3fbdddfb8ab42aa.png"><br></div></div><br>  The inclusion of the latter mode can be carried out for a certain time, which is convenient for installing new applications and performing operations that do not require constant monitoring of processes. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Select the shutdown interval</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/bba/e39/86d/bbae3986d2014b1fae65afb8a1b586d8.png"><br></div></div><br>  Setting up the white list is very flexible, and even excessively flexible, so that the anatomical user such anatomical details can easily confuse. <br><br>  The application allows you to add trusted applications, certificates and scripts. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Advanced installations</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/8c9/96d/42a/8c996d42a3f448c398a34d5231f7645a.png"><br></div></div><br>  The whitelist can be completely customized.  In addition, the program provides a monitoring mode that allows the execution and operation of untrusted processes, but all actions performed by them are saved in a log. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Whitelist settings</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ada/f95/69c/adaf9569c90c47d2a6eb2ced8d022cbf.png"><br></div></div><br>  The program integrates into the operating system shell, so that a quick scan of any file is available when you right-click on it.  It should be noted that the scan may take some time, since the file must first be uploaded to the server. <br><br>  Depending on your needs, you can configure the anti-virus mechanism ‚Äî enable or disable working engines for scanning suspicious objects that will be sent for scanning via the Internet in real time. <br><br>  In the case of limited communications, it is possible to set a daily limit for downloadable files. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Universal Antivirus</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/110/6a1/94a/1106a194a9ca41548110faac70c48a07.png"><br></div></div><br>  To test the operation of SecureAPlus, I tried to download and start the installation of the Yandex browser.  During the launch, a nice window appeared with information about the object and the choice of the desired action.  If the user does not know whether he can trust the file being launched, he can check it with the help of the cloud antivirus, or immediately block the malicious application. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Choice of action</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c0f/a85/c9e/c0fa85c9e2914e98bb53c93c3bfe2bf2.png"><br></div></div><br>  In the course of work, the program also scans files in the background process and, if it finds threats, then immediately informs about them in such a cartoon window. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Threat Information</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c8f/a21/f87/c8fa21f878af4d2f9c53b740645a1c54.png"><br></div></div><br>  View information allows you to get comprehensive information about the threat. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Threat Information</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7f0/baf/83b/7f0baf83b3f044e0bc67970a38b16304.png"><br></div></div><br>  SecureAPlus makes a very good impression, the tool is able to protect the computer before installing and in the process of operating suspicious applications.  Antivirus is easy to use and is characterized by a clear, beautiful, albeit slightly frivolous interface.  Among the shortcomings, we can distinguish some redundancy in the functionality and a too detailed setting, which may not always be up to the average user. <br><br><h1>  <font color="#3693da">Defendset</font> </h1><br>  Defendset is a proactive solution for blocking unauthorized file operations that works in Windows 7/8/10 and Windows Server 2008/2012/2016 operating systems. <br><br>  The cost of the license depends on the scope of its application.  Home non-profit or personal license - 320 rubles., Corporate license for organizations - 970 rubles., Server - 4600 rubles.  Prices are for one year of use.  Product site: <a href="https://defendset.ru/">https://defendset.ru</a> <br><br>  When first installed, a trial 30-day license is provided, without any limitations in functionality, which allows you to evaluate the usefulness of the tool and make an informed purchasing decision. <br><br>  During the installation process, the user is prompted to select the initial security level. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7a5/886/476/7a5886476c6b413e8eba9e938cb299a3.png"><br><br>  All management is carried out using the settings window, which appears after clicking on the program icon.

There are not many of them, but these are the most basic ones - creation, modification, deletion and discovery. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Rule settings</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e5c/22c/02b/e5c22c02b5c64522adf25ebdb9dfb0d3.png"><br></div></div><br>  The next tab is the paths for placing blocked files, and exceptions to them.

For example, in this rule it is not forbidden to do anything to programs from standard program folders, there will be a need - you can add something else. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Process setup</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ba7/db1/595/ba7db1595e374261913f8f74543553db.png"><br></div></div><br>  For testing, we will try to download and install the Yandex browser.

In general, I liked the program. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, developers can be counted thoughtful concise interface. I would also note extremely simple operation - after installation, the program immediately starts to perform its functions, without requiring any training from the user and without asking obscure questions, but still you should not rely completely on protection for one application, so it would be better to use it in tandem with antivirus.</font></font><br><br><h2>  <font color="#3693da">findings</font> </h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Summing up, I want to say that the development of anti-virus protection does not stand still, new ideas and solutions appear, and developers who do not want to integrate them into their products will be forced to remain in the rearguard. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In my opinion, blocking unauthorized operations today is very promising, interesting and, as practice shows, a rather viable protection mechanism. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I hope that something like this tool in its arsenal will soon have all the leading anti-virus products.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/335448/">https://habr.com/ru/post/335448/</a></p>
