From my experience I know that there are often moments of misunderstanding of one another.  In order to somehow help both reach an understanding, I offer a summary of Rob Walling's <a href="http://www.softwarebyrob.com/articles/Nine_Things_Developers_Want_More_Than_Money.aspx">article</a> : <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Money is a strong motivation, but sometimes it is not the final and decisive factor in the struggle for good workers. <br><br>  <b>1. Start to succeed</b>

      This is a sad truth, but many software projects fail.  Each developer has history and counter-examples of poor project management in stock. <br><br>  Realistic deadlines are the basis of project success.  Developers want to make software that not only works, but which is not a shame to show, and which they can then be proud of.  This principle is often at odds with the goals set by the management, which wants to get just working software. <br><br>  In general, the first thing that suffers with a lack of time is quality and reliability.  The most evil that you can bring to the developer is to make him make a bullshit.  What pride in your work then can we talk? <br><br>  Work needs to be done not only quickly, but also efficiently.  One developer I spoke with said: ‚ÄúQuality is as important as budget and functionality.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>2. Excellent leadership</b> <br><br>  Good project management is important both for the project itself and for people who will be motivated by excellent management.  This means being able to listen to an independent point of view, to know what it costs to develop a quality product, to be able to make quick decisions and to be able to take responsibility for the whole team. <br><br>  <b>3. Learning something new</b> <br><br>  Studies of people's behavior show that we feel more comfortable when we learn new things.  Two researchers from Columbia University concluded that workers are willing to give up an average of 20% increase if the work becomes more diverse or requires more extensive knowledge of the subject.  In fact, we choose a lower salary in favor of a fun, interesting work for us, which also allows us to expand and deepen our knowledge. <br><br>  Every developer I know loves to play with new technologies.  The ability to saturate the need to learn new things should be for everyone.  Allow your employees to learn, and they will be happy at work even in a windowless basement, where stale food is served through a small window.  And they do not mention a word about promotion. <br><br>  <b>4. Creativity and solving real problems</b> <br><br>  Developers love being challenged.  Without a fight, they are bored: they start checking email, visit Digg and Slashdot, read blogs and see which friends are online just to chat about their uncle, IDisposable interface or a piece of toast shaped like St. Mary. <br><br>  How many times have I seen developers who have solved technical problems before dawn even when they were not asked to do so, and no one even stuttered about overtime.  The best developers just live solving problems.  Most of these people will not leave the case until the problem is resolved, and even more they delay the fact that the task will require a non-standard approach. <br><br>  <b>5. The right to vote</b> <br><br>  Developers are those people who are the first to find out about a non-working system or process.  I once heard: ‚ÄúI want someone to listen to my problems and take them seriously.  I worked in several places where the amount of memory, the number of hard disks and the processor clock frequency simply did not interest the company management.  Every time I had to delete temporary files, because there was not enough disk space.  You know, working with outdated equipment is just annoying. ‚Äù <br><br>  When a developer says, someone should listen to him.  When several developers talk about the same thing, then someone is obliged to listen to them and act quickly. <br><br>  <b>6. Recognition for hard work</b> <br><br>  Developers love hard jobs and jobs that impress themselves and their friends. <br><br>  <b>7. Creating something important</b> <br><br>  We are not doctors in Bosnia or even food porters in Sudan, but nevertheless, many people feel that they would like to do something good for the world, something social and technological at the same time.  A system engineer who has created a logistic system that will reduce the mileage of the track made by machines for everyday distribution of the press will have more joy than a programmer who has written a program that will be launched 15 times a whole year. <br><br>  Copy-peist pieces of code with changes to labels is not really such an interesting job as it may seem. <br><br>  <b>8. Creating software should not be accompanied by excessive bureaucracy</b> <br><br>  I worked under the contract for three years since 2001.  During this time I wrote a lot of web applications.  I easily wrote code when I knew exactly what and how to do.  Together with one developer, we wrote tons of software for a couple.  And, here, on my next job, software production could be compared to dragging with a weight.  Creating each new page required the convening of six people to approve the changes.  Development stretched 5 times longer.  This is pretty annoying.  The ability to make decisions without sitting in a group of people makes work very, very easy. <br><br>  <b>9. Few restrictions</b> <br><br>  Horrible code, interface bugs and poorly developed data model do not like anyone.  Too many restrictions reduce the creative component, make gathering for making decisions on changes and in general, discourages all the desire to give all the best in the work on the project. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/3020/">https://habr.com/ru/post/3020/</a></p>
