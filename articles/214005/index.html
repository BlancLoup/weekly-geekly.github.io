The company was one of the leading Chinese manufacturers of telecommunications equipment, and the newspaper was its internal media.  It is published in English, and it is distributed free of charge at the offices of all countries where there are its representative offices. <br><br>  In my opinion, it turned out quite funny, if we take into account the illustrations. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      The article asked to write a story on the topic of wireless communication in remote corners of the country.  The tone of the invitation was almost pleading, and one could understand that no one wanted to do this, and the newspaper clearly did not have enough material on this topic.  And an illustration came to my mind, remarkably suitable for the topic of the article.  In this situation, I decided to help the Chinese colleagues. <br><br>  The combination of remote villages and high technology is well illustrated by this image. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ad3/5d5/59a/ad35d559a33e6d3203e0ff31d11e4d1a.jpg"><br><br>  In the article I wrote that in remote areas of Russia, wiring is difficult because of the great distances and climate, and mobile technologies will be very useful there.  Since the equipment of this company is one of the cheapest, there it could be in demand. <br><br>  Then there was a second illustration about the current state of communication in distant villages. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dcd/72d/f2f/dcd72df2f228eca59f4553ca7191f88c.jpg"><br><br>  But will they be able to publish an article with such not very serious illustrations? <br><br>  And now, after some time, the answer came that they would be able to publish my article, said ‚Äúthank you very much‚Äù and sent an electronic version of the newspaper. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c1e/3aa/3db/c1e3aa3dba71716ca9206abda1fd390e.jpg" width="500" height="477"><br></a> <br>  <i>Click on image to enlarge.</i> <br><br>  The text is not very complicated, the article is not big. <br><br>  <i><b>Cross-country communication</b></i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Communications were always a big problem.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>If you‚Äôre trying to reach a distance, you can deal with a lot of forests and lakes.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The solution surely comes from wireless communication networks.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>It is not only the voice voice quality.</i>  <i>If you‚Äôve ever tried to landline in a distant village,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>It is a weather condition.</i>  <i>It makes building and maintenance of landlines more difficult.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>It is the most convenient mobile devices.</i>  <i>Now you can buy a SIM card and a small country shop.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>If you want to buy them.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Wireless communications for the countryside.</i>  <i>So lots of villagers begin using 3G modems in their daily life.</i>  <i>There is a lot of time to spend time browsing the network, sending E-mails, using instant messengers or playing online games.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>It makes it possible to use your mobile phone.</i> <br><br>  As a reward for the article paid for it in Chinese yuan.  180 yuan, which amounted to almost 1000 rubles, which was then very difficult to get, because foreign employees did not transfer money through the bank.  The name ‚ÄúCross-country‚Äù is usually written with a dash, but my editor was Chinese, and Asian English is a separate topic. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/04b/70e/1d0/04b70e1d04383c17447d557b3aea5b53.jpg" width="600" height="137"></a> <br><br>  Indeed, the article was published, even in spite of the comic illustrations.  I managed to publish an article in this English-language newspaper.  As it turned out, I was not the only one who distinguished himself: someone had published a Negro in his article talking on a mobile phone with a television antenna.  Not to say that it was a very profitable occupation - it cost a lot of problems to get a fee for it.  I had to ask my Chinese colleague to bring the cash fee from China. <br><br>  Somewhere in about a week, an article appeared on paper. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/70c/f2e/dda/70cf2edda72de39f874129cd076cbbb9.jpg" width="500" height="589"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/214005/">https://habr.com/ru/post/214005/</a></p>
