  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yandex again scared of canceling the reference or a new ranking algorithm - Minusinsk</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On April 15, Yandex once again announced a tightening of the algorithm with respect to sites promoted with the help of links.  The changes will take effect on May 15, 2015, so promoters who buy links are still bundles have time to drop them, but, as Yandex says, this should be done as soon as possible, since the search engine will still have to understand that there are no links.  Yandex also hinted that he would punish first of all SEOs who ‚Äúhave been engaged in the purchase of links for a long time and on a large scale‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Speech by Alexander Sadovsky, Yandex Search Services Director</b> <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/CfXS9pJdwRo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiFpoZk8GNr-3jcWTVtl2H-HMAlnQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The next intimidation by canceling the reference today will probably not surprise anyone.  We got used to it.  For 7 years, Yandex has been engaged in threats against the so-called unscrupulous helpers and threatened with sanctions in the form of pessimization or a ban.  At the same time, he is well aware that there are no exclusively white promotion methods that allow competing in search results in any field of activity.  And the one who tries to prove the opposite, trying in vain to push the site to the top, is doomed to failure. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Swam know </h4><br>  Let me remind you that Yandex since 2008 has been disapprovingly looking at sites promoted with the help of links.  A few years ago, very large companies, which at the time were leading in the field of website promotion, got under the hot hand of Yandex.  These sites could be seen at 1-3 positions in Yandex search results for queries: ‚Äúwebsite promotion‚Äù, ‚Äúwebsite promotion‚Äù.  I deliberately do not call the names of companies, we will not engage in anti-advertising.  These same companies are still engaged in promotion, however, on the above requests they are very deep in the depths of search results.  Sanctions specifically from these sites have not been removed.

      But it was only in December 2013 that Yandex really scared the SEO community and said that in 3 months it would completely eliminate reference factors for commercial requests.  To begin with, the changes should have affected only Moscow.  After some time, other regions.  The link has been canceled, but somehow strange.  Cancel touched certain topics and possibly certain sites. <br><br><h4>  What is the situation now </h4><br>  I‚Äôll immediately say that I practice to the bone and don‚Äôt believe anyone or anything until I try it myself.  Constantly looking for new and new promotion schemes, experiments are being conducted on more than one dozen sites, both on my own and on client ones.  There is a group of sites that undergo the most daring experiments.  I can definitely say that link promotion is working now.  Yes, definitely not as bright as before, but it works, including in the Moscow region for commercial needs.  Otherwise, how can you explain the fact that on three sites at one time 100% of links were removed, on the second one - 50% and in a month another 50%.  The third links were removed gradually, the pleasure stretched for 3 months.  All sites are Moscow, requests are commercial.  Positions in the top or near the top.  The result was the same for all sites.  After 4 months, the site was out of the top 50 for all relevant requests.  After 4 months, I began to slowly restore the same links, sites began to be selected to the tops.  The link taking experiment was conducted from August 2014 to November 2014. Themes are very diverse: curtains, air tickets, plastic surgery.  I apologize for not accompanying words with graphs and detailed figures, but the conclusion is obvious: the <b>reference works</b> ! <br><br>  Of course, no one has canceled the other factors affecting the advancement, such as correct internal optimization, work on behavioral factors and social signals, etc. But no matter how well a resource is made, no matter how behavioral they are, advance the site along the mid-frequencies without a reference will not work. <br><br><h4>  What will happen after May 15 </h4><br>  Let's see what happens in a month, whether Yandex‚Äôs statement will be another Chinese warning, and punishment will befall only certain sites or we will really see a serious interference with the algorithms.  I am sure that none of the SEOs, whose sites are in the top or next to it and will not lift a finger, to remove over the years the accumulated links, on which they spent their hard-earned or client funds.  Why chop the branch on which you sit.  Maybe this time will carry. <br><br><h4>  Opinion </h4><br>  Yandex, of course, well done, that is trying to clean the Internet from the mountain sites, but such methods in the form of intimidation and threats will not lead to anything.  All those who occupy leading positions in search results, occupy these places precisely due to the promotion, the lion's share of which is the purchase of a reference.  And these are quite decent sites with useful content, competitive prices, convenient service.  So why should some of the good sites have to suffer, and they should come from the second dozen because they have 30% less link.  Not fair somehow.  A single-step exclusion from the algorithm of all the parameters responsible for the accounting of the reference and, by the way, the cancellation of the useless TCI, looks much more correct.  Why not make the second button next to the search bar "Search without reference to the reference."  In my opinion, a great option, I would really like to see which sites will be in the top in this situation. <br><br>  By the way, Google a couple of months ago also hinted that it would soon tweak the algorithm in the direction of assessing the quality of site content.  This topic will touch on a little bit below.  Some comrades in the shop say that they have already noticed some unhealthy changes in positions on Google, but I still have no changes. <br><br><h4>  A little google </h4><br>  Since I started talking about a possible impending storm at Yandex, I‚Äôll say a little about Google.  Maybe not everyone is aware that Google recently announced work on a new <b>Knowledge-Based Trust</b> algorithm or just <b>KWT</b> .  The algorithm is aimed at assessing the degree of relevance of the search query and the correctness of the information provided on the site.  The study of endogenous signals is what Google has long sought.  Obviously, the search engine also tries to take into account the link less and less, trying to go into an in-depth analysis of the quality of the content and its relevance to the request.  There is a document describing the operation of the algorithm, who can be curious to read the <a href="http://webarty.ru/files/google-Knowledge-Based-Trust.pdf">pdf</a> .  Unfortunately, it is not yet clear when the KBT algorithm will be launched, but work on it has been going on since August 2014. It also remains to ask what percentage of sites will be affected by the changes, whether the site‚Äôs algorithm will only affect the actual material or Google will spread the new algorithm to a wider audience . <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Search engines for many years trying to revise their algorithms, shifting the emphasis towards the relevance of content to the input request and less and less considering reference factors.  For violators used different penalties, but it is difficult to call the fight against the reference.  I would like to see really radical measures in the form of carpet bombing, and not a point sweep, as in all previous times.  But it turns out not quite an objective approach: everyone is equal, but someone is more equal.  I will be glad to hear your opinion. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289844/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289844/</a></p>
