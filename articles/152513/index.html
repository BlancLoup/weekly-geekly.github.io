Plastic, which in those days was not considered to be the coolest, feels like a lot better that goes on modern smartphones.  A small black and white screen, the bottom of which is the area of ‚Äã‚Äãgraffiti.  At the expense of the graffiti area, the perception of the PDA screen size was simply changed in a cheat way.  But in fact, there is a touch, but the display is gone.  On top there was also a cover, from which only the mount remained.  Six keys that can be programmed and used in their applications. <br><br>  Complete with a palm tree, there was also a massive cradle, which increased the severity of the view by a factor of two if the palm tree is in it.

    <h4>  Hard moment </h4><br>  The central processor is Motorolla Dragonball EZ, as much as 16 MHz.  Although hand on heart - even then it was not much. <br><br>  RAM - 8 megabytes.  It was also used for the needs of the file system. <br><br>  ROM - 2 megabytes.  Unfortunately, not rewritable. <br><br>  The screen is resistive, the diagonal is 3 inches.  Resolution 160x160 pixels, 16 shades of gray.  The device still has a pleasant green light, which does not blind at night and does not illuminate the entire room at once.  What is a plus for me. <br><br>  External communication - IrDA (which could control the TV) and COM-port. <br><br>  OS version - PalmOS 3.5.1.  Not the newest at that time, but quite sufficient to use the device. <br><br>  It works on AAA batteries - a plus for me.  This allows me to use it, and so far, without suffering from the ‚Äútransfer of cans‚Äù in batteries.  Just went to the store and bought two AAA-battery. <br><br>  The device is particularly durable - it is the only touch-device that has survived until now, although it fell hard on the asphalt and on concrete, and that just did not happen to it, but it did not lose its strength.  In general, I consider myself one of the most serious crash tests. <br><br>  By the way, about the stylus - it was plastic and made from one piece of plastic.  Many were afraid that it would break off and it would be necessary to buy a whole new stylus - for 10 years now, and I still have the same stylus.  It is lightweight, but it is impossible to use it for resetting (there is a small hole-drop behind it). <br><br>  It was possible to connect a keyboard to a palm tree.  But I did not have it.  A pity - even now I would not have refused it. <br><br><h4>  Soft moment </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a93/165/300/a931653001087aec36732fc1239f6a94.jpg"><br><br>  Convenience PalmOS I always liked.  The system has been sufficiently developed.  <s>The unique interface</s> is in many ways similar to the Apple Newton, but in those days nobody really remembered about apple handheld devices.  The OS itself did not pull the Russian language out of the box.  But with a palm tree in the kit there was a disk with software, among which was a licensed crack from Paragon.  The disk was lost, and I still use a palm tree - the localizer has been replaced by CyrHack. <br><br>  One of the musthave programs for the palm server was and remains FastCPU - it allowed to overclock and slow down the processor.  In my palm, everything except games runs at a minimum frequency, and games at 32 megahertz. <br><br>  Speaking of games.  At one time it was, and so it is not enough written time killers for palm trees.  Almost for every taste and color.  Even ‚Äúbagels‚Äù are. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/15b/22c/25a/15b22c25a7fccafc115990cde5b691b3.jpg"><br><br>  Or for Nintendo fans there is a free Game Boy emulator (I sold it real not so long ago) - Phoenix.  With an overclocked processor, you can play without feeling uncomfortable.  Assigning more convenient keys, except for start and select (they remain on the screen). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0cb/aa1/e71/0cbaa1e716bfb7339490fe89d3c51978.jpg"><br><br>  The main use of palm trees for me is reading books from it.  You can of course buy an e-book.  But is it necessary?  Mostly I still read paper books, and those cases when I read electronic books, the palm tree copes with a bang.  I read with the help of the iSilo reader, although it is not the only one, they say it is better. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/98d/4c3/308/98d4c3308142b585b89115f057825b95.jpg"><br><br>  A set of standard applications - I apologize for the tautology - is standard.  There is a reminder planner, a phone book, a calculator, and To-Do, and notes (both letter and handwritten) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/13c/3ed/3c1/13c3ed3c1a1afdf5c833d338b80f0439.jpg"><br><br>  I remember that I used to even use some simple mathematical package on it, often flew to Void (elite-shaped space) and saved the kingdom in the local port of King's Bounty.  There were also programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat allowed writing without the use of a big brother. <br><br>  As part of the connection with the big brother, here I use JPilot, which is found in almost every Linux repository.  Perhaps the program is not the best, so those needs that arise before the house when using a palm tree, it solves.  The role of the COM port is performed by my gambird cable.  Just because there is, but there is no COM port on the laptop. <br><br><h4>  PS </h4><br>  For the curious, the guitar in the Danelectro U2 1st Reissue photo, the lamps - domestic - 6N2P, 6P14P, 6N6P.  And I apologize for the quality of the photo. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/152513/">https://habr.com/ru/post/152513/</a></p>
