In my description I will try not to duplicate the information from this post. <br><br>  I started preparing in 2014 and the transition from 10 domains to 8 has not yet taken place.  I had to prepare first with the old textbooks, and then switch to new ones.  I will give below a description of my own experience, and some conclusions that may be useful for those who are planning to get a certificate. <br><br>  To prepare, I chose the tactics of slow mastering the material - I read the textbook on the way from home to office and back.  It turned out about an hour a day.  It is better to prepare for English textbooks, because there are few English terms left in the textbooks translated into Russian, and it will be difficult to navigate the questions in English. <a name="habracut"></a>

      I was taught by my English teachers to write out unfamiliar words and memorize their translation.  As a result, my vocabulary added to 250 new words.  For myself, as a tool, I used Exel-tables, where words are entered in two columns - one with English, the other with translation.  It was convenient to print them on a piece of paper for offline learning.  Also helped change the sorting of words, then in English alphabet, then in Russian. <br><br>  I advise you not to use textbooks for old-style exams (until 2015), since  during the transition to the new program, significant changes were made, both in the course and in the terminology. <br><br>  After work on the textbooks, there comes the stage of training with test questions.  Without him, the exam will not work.  There are many resources with such questions.  Of the free ones, I liked the <a href="https://www.skillset.com/certifications/cissp">Skillset</a> resource <a href="https://www.skillset.com/certifications/cissp">more</a> .  I listened to the recommendations of past generations of the examinees and for $ 129.99 I got myself a paid annual access to the commercial base of questions <a href="https://www.freepracticetests.org/quiz/index.php">CCCure</a> . <br><br>  Thanks to my employer for financial assistance.  The choice of the training base was really good - except for a large number of questions (about 2,000), a service is provided to select questions by topic, domain, those that were not selected earlier, or to which incorrect answers were given. <br><br>  When working with the test base, I again took advantage of someone else's experience - I first worked through the questions within one domain, and when the number of correct answers was more than 80% went to the next.  At the final stage, I already trained on questions from different domains. <br><br>  Test questions for parsing are often provided with a brief reference material.  According to him, I formed my own letters with a ‚Äúreference signal‚Äù in the form of a list, a list or a brief hint.  These 79 letters I also used to consolidate the material in the last days before the exam. <br><br>  I planned my exam after the New Year holidays to use my free time for preparation.  Every day I started with a test: I started with 100 questions, the next day 150, then 200, and finally 250. When I went to the exam, I realized that it was doable on my own experience. <br><br>  On the evening before the exam, sammaris helped in 25 pages.  Under the new program, I did not find a sammari, I had to use the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/christianreina/cissp-summary-v11">old one.</a> <br><br>  To pass the exam in Russia at the moment is possible only in Moscow and St. Petersburg.  I handed over in Moscow.  The approach to testing is serious - you are photographed, scanned with both palms, take an electronic signature sample, ask to bring two documents with your signature and photo.  Testing takes place on the computer.  In one room, a lot of people pass different tests, each with their own, so they give out earplugs.  They are very useful. <br><br>  It makes no sense to make cheat sheets, because all the things before the exam you put in the locker.  The bag is deeper, and drinks, food and medicine are closer to the door.  In the room where you provide the computer for the test, allowed only after checking all the pockets and roll-up sleeves.  During the break, you are asked to show what you are taking from the locker (you cannot take gadgets).  Before returning to the computer, check the pockets and sleeves again. <br><br>  The exam itself gave me a surprise - it took much less time for each question during training.  in the real exam there were a lot of new terms and unfamiliar English words.  The English-Russian dictionary was very helpful, which you are allowed to take with you.  It should be a simple dictionary, not sensible and not specialized.  Self-made dictionaries are also not allowed. <br><br>  At first I assumed that I would not linger on difficult questions, but would return to them later, so that I had enough time to answer all the questions.  This was only partly true - when almost 6 hours passed, there was no longer enough strength to re-view pending questions. <br><br>  Some answers had to be chosen not by the method of knowledge, but by the method of analyzing the answer.  There were answers that coincide in meaning, but differing only in the wording, this is a sign that none of them is the correct answer.  This is not my invention, I read it from someone, but it helped not to get lost in the choice of the answer in a pair of dozens of questions. <br><br>  Before the completion of the exam, I was not sure that I scored the required 70% correct answers.  It is good that the result is reported immediately, but it does not take long to languish in ignorance. <br><br>  I hope my experience and advice will help future applicants to prepare better and pass the exam easier. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/330984/">https://habr.com/ru/post/330984/</a></p>
