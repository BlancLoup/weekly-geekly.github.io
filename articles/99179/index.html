It is not surprising that my friend, a graduate of LETI, knows them, and the familiar Muscovite habrovans do not.  But more recently, ‚ÄúMasterkit‚Äù began to sell <a href="http://gadgets.masterkit.ru/">more and gadgets</a> , among which are these glasses.  Here I will tell about them. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  I got this gadget for a test in an unpretentious box √† la vsasyrtsvetmetkhimprombumaga.  The guys from ‚ÄúMasterkit‚Äù explained this by the almost pre-production character of the device.  So this is an exclusive in every sense: for the time that it lay with me, they have already developed a package design and all subsequent consumers will get these glasses in a wrapper more brightly:

But on the other hand, the effect they produce on others is super, the closest association is robocop.  Just right, to photograph in them your reflection in the mirror and post it on some kind of <s>dating</s> site.  I have such a photo, but I‚Äôd not risk putting it on a review on Habr√© :) So for now we‚Äôll get by with the official photos. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e71/5bb/b27/e715bbb27aa03c1fc39ce5123c422fea.png" width="750" height="502" alt="149.04 KB"><br><br>  There are few wires: two wires - from the ‚Äúears‚Äù of inserts, another one from charging itself and with a video-audio signal. <br><br>  On the nose, the glasses sit comfortably, although with prolonged wear, the plastic of the lining begins to seem harsh and require adjusting the glasses on the stiff nose. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b4c/dc2/01b/b4cdc201b31e1490b091c21dc5cc3e59.jpg" width="750" height="529" alt="49.31 KB"><br><br>  More inconvenience is delivered by a rubber mask, a pad on glasses, which should protect the eyes from light and foreign species.  It fits tightly to the face, leaving gaps, so after a while I just removed it.  In principle, you can watch the video without it - it is only desirable that the room (or in the transport) has twilight, bright sunlight is generally contraindicated to them - it flashes everything nafig.  If in transport, it is possible, for example, to push the cap deeper, and also norms. <br><br><h4>  Equipment </h4><br>  Included with glasses are several types of adapters: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3cd/934/137/3cd934137ea9d1d9163ae8efdbbb395c.jpg" width="750" height="563" alt="219.64 KB"><br><ol><li>  mini jack 4-pin (f) to 3RCA (m) </li><li>  mini jack 4-pin (f) to 3RCA (f) </li><li>  mini jack 4-pin (f) to mini jack (m) + mini jack video (m) </li><li>  mini jack 4-pin (f) to mini jack 4-pin (m) </li></ol><br>  They are designed to connect to devices that have AV / TV output, including both regular DVD players and iPods.  Regarding the latter, there was no opportunity to check, unfortunately, but there were no problems with connecting to DVD players, including portable ones (someone is buying them).  Convenient, for example, on trips. <br><br><h4>  Exploitation </h4><br>  Speaking of trips.  The charge of the lithium-ion battery, adjusted for the difference between the actual results and the stated ones, should be enough for just one film 2 - 2.5 hours in duration.  The declared operating time is 4 hours, the time of full battery charge is 3 hours. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/39d/350/4a8/39d3504a8e8bcfadd872c4e2e8eee605.jpg" width="750" height="529" alt="120.07 KB"><br><br>  In principle, these glasses are best suited precisely for non-standard conditions for watching a video - in a queue, on vehicles, lying on their backs.  (For example, in a train - at night in a compartment, in order not to wake companions, you can watch movies in them.) For large families in a small living space - when someone is already asleep, you want to watch a movie or downloaded videos.  I remembered, by the way, my first-order hostel of the uni - I think, then this thing would also be very helpful :) <br><br><h4>  Picture </h4><br>  And most importantly - the picture, which eventually MT6060 gives.  The stated characteristics - the effect of a 40-inch screen and a resolution of 640x480.  Still, the resolution for such a diagonal, albeit a virtual one, is not enough.  Therefore, the picture quality is the same as on Youtube before the advent of HD.  For a screensaver of a fresh blockbuster or some kind of a romcom, just right, but in good quality it is better to watch films with special effects on a more suitable real big screen.  But watch videos from the old YouTube - just right. <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  It is unlikely that these points will have a great success - the point is that both the price and the fact that 40 inches of the declared ‚Äúdiagonal‚Äù do not turn the MT6060 into a replacement for the home <s>droid R2D2 and C3PO</s> cinemas.  This is more about an auxiliary solution for mobile devices with a large memory, but a small screen.  For $ 300 (at least, it is such a price for them <a href="http://www.smartron.ru/katalog/products/road/video-ochki/video-ochki-mt6060-2752">in the online store</a> ) we get a virtual monitor with average characteristics, but with two undoubted advantages: low weight and closeness from people around you - no matter what you look at, nobody is looking at you in the screen. peep.  Well, plus the wow effect, which is known to be priceless. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99179/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99179/</a></p>
