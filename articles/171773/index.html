  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Available for download ReSharper 8 EAP</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the world of new technologies, no company can afford to stand still.  As new frameworks and programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãcome out, ReSharper tries to keep up with them.  Actually, therefore, we are pleased to announce the opening <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ReSharper/ReSharper%2B8%2BEAP" title="http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ReSharperInt/ReSharper+8+EAP">of the ReSharper 8 EAP program</a> and, in connection with the upcoming release, provide you with an overview of the features that will appear in ReSharper 8. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Go to everything </h3><br>  In preparing ReSharper 8, we made efforts to simplify some frequently used functionality.  One of the aspects that we have tried to improve is too many different Go To menus.  In an attempt to simplify the task, we changed the behavior of the <em>Go To Type</em> command (Ctrl + T), so that it now allows you to navigate to the type, symbol, or file name, and all these elements are shown in one list. <br><br>  By default, the list shows the files with which the user has recently worked: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/870/1f8/b01/8701f8b0134da490a839b3f5623a4e9e.png">
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Search by specific identifier gives all the files, types and elements in which this identifier is found: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d03/1f4/16a/d031f416ae368c790d9c5358813a54b0.png"><br><br>  Do not worry - all previous "specializations" of commands (for example, <em>Go To File</em> ) remained in place, and dynamic switching between them, too.  The function of selectors also remained in place, so you can, for example, write <code>ClassName.MemberName</code> to find a specific element of a particular class.  Also available combo navigation, wildcards and camel-humps.  In addition, we have added several new selectors: for example, if you write <code>public</code> or <code>private</code> , you limit the list of items to their appearance.  We tried to optimize the performance of this menu, so the search in it should be done very quickly. <br><br><h3>  Auto Completion Improvements (Code Completion) </h3><br>  In this release, a number of significant improvements to the code auto-completion mechanism have appeared. <br><br><h4>  New autocomplete elements </h4><br>  For example, if you take a class and begin to inherit it from <code>INotify</code> , R # will provide you with the following list of possible interfaces: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac4/955/076/ac4955076195bf409b6c4349c10b1615.png"><br><br>  Auto-completion options include all possible interfaces that begin with <code>INotify</code> , and when you select one of them, R # will automatically add the appropriate <code>using</code> in the file header. <br><br>  In addition, ReShaprer now offers several generative autocompletions, in particular, the addition for the <code>partial</code> and <code>override</code> keywords: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/129/c32/956/129c3295685b28a1251633df32c07bfc.png"><br><br>  And finally, we have slightly improved the existing auto-completion mechanisms.  For example, the autocompletion list for initializing a collection now includes the keyword <code>new</code> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/40b/cb7/bb1/40bcb7bb1cfd3bbb27d3dc6e11162046.png"><br><br><h4>  Other auto completion enhancements </h4><br>  Another new feature we added is called double completion.  The idea is this: when you use simple autocompletion (Ctrl + Space) once, you may not be able to get the item you need because it is not available.  Therefore, you can press the same key combination again, and this time the search range will already become wider and will include, for example, all connected assemblies. <br><br>  A similar mechanism is used for smart additions (smart completion, Ctrl + Alt + Space).  By pressing this key combination several times, you will get hints on all possible options for accessing the selected item, including, for example, the use of extension methods. <br><br>  Double add-on mechanisms are supported by quick-fixes, so if you get a symbol that is, for example, private, you can immediately apply the fix to make it public. <br><br><h3>  New inspections </h3><br>  In each release, we add new code inspections, as well as improve existing ones.  Here is a small sample: <br><br><ul><li>  Now you can <strong>disable all</strong> ReSharper <strong>warnings with</strong> one comment - instead of separately selecting those inspections that you want to ‚Äúsuppress‚Äù, now it‚Äôs enough to write <code>// ReSharper disable all</code> and R # will not generate errors in the code until it encounters the final comment <code>// ReSharper restore all</code> . <br></li><li>  Now you can quickly switch between <strong>array initialization</strong> <strong>expressions</strong> and <strong>array creation expressions</strong> ;  ReSharper offers relevant validation as well as contextual actions: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c6e/0bd/63c/c6e0bd63cdf733a4df43911102e20b9e.png"><br></li></ul><br><br>  Now you can <strong>convert recursive calls to iterative calls</strong> : <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/615/0ef/732/6150ef7327805d5fa5bc5873d3e6c7c3.png"><br><br><br>  If the method has an <strong>overload that allows cancellation of the call</strong> (i.e. accepts <code>CancellationToken</code> ), then R # will prompt you to use this overload provided that you have an available cancellation token in the current context: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fa2/6db/e4e/fa26dbe4e39a805671c0a62b2652b583.png"><br><br><br>  Added support for ‚Äúbackup‚Äù colors in CSS: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bfe/d9b/601/bfed9b60104916c21a6b829347eff1a4.png"><br><br><br><br>  The list above is just a small sample of a large number of inspections that we added. <br><br><h3>  CSS support enhancements </h3><br>  To help developers ensure proper execution of code on different browsers, ReSharper included configurable support for CSS3 and earlier versions, as well as compatibility checks with popular web browsers: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e9a/c51/f4e/e9ac51f4e98d706504dbdeef0ea944ba.png"><br><br>  As a result of these checks, ReSharper now provides detailed information about the availability of a particular feature in a specific browser: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ff3/05f/356/ff305f356b81ca2d775886c458930bc4.png"><br><br>  We continue to improve our understanding of R # different CSS declarations, be they in JSON ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac5/e7d/878/ac5e7d87830aa72e09e6da0198c30602.png"><br><br>  ... or in string literals <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/716/b71/dea/716b71deaa3e606401412e4665b8485e.png"><br><br>  ... or even in the declaration of anonymous types: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f5c/e70/606/f5ce706069e35f94222ee3fc82de1394.png"><br><br>  Search by CSS attributes also became smarter.  For example, if you try to find the red color in the code, ReSharper will show all the places in CSS, JavaScript and C #, where this color appears, regardless of how it is defined: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5fa/69f/a6d/5fa69fa6d56e525d1fe0e2db6ea809d6.png"><br><br>  Finally, ReSharper now supports refactoring of identifiers defined in CSS: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de9/7cb/6bb/de97cb6bbe56a9e8f6be228754a93c84.png"><br><br><h3>  Assembly explorer </h3><br>  Those of you who are familiar with <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/" title="http://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/">dotPeek</a> , our free decompiler, probably already know Assembly Explorer - a panel similar to Solution Explorer that shows you decompiled assemblies.  So, the good news is that this panel is now part of ReSharper: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/37f/d65/255/37fd65255d6664f80582fd88012bd1d6.png"><br><br>  Assembly Explorer is a very powerful utility that can extract assemblies from various file formats (for example, ZIP).  Assembly Explorer is also very easy to expand, as dotPeek plug-in writers do today.  Now its features are available for expansion right through ReSharper. <br><br><h3>  BAML decompiler </h3><br>  Since we are talking about decompiling, another useful feature should be mentioned - the ability to decompile BAML.  This means that if you have a WPF compiled application, you can decompile it and look at the XAML code with which it is made: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ba/182/dfd/7ba182dfda3452a64b69899324813dce.png"><br><br>  Note that the generated XAML supports all the same navigation and search capabilities that ReSharper or dotPeek supports. <br><br><h3>  And something else... </h3><br>  Here are a few things that I want to mention. <br><br>  First, we adjusted the formatting system and Code Cleanup, so now it correctly processes the preprocessing directives <code>#if</code> and <code>#region</code> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/692/9d9/71d/6929d971dbc786e1566f4e4de77546c9.png"><br><br>  In addition to the possibility of using R # as a plug-in for the Studio, we also provide a command line utility that can take a decision and, based on it, analyze the code and put the result into an XML file.  Now it is provided as a separate download, which we will update as new EAP versions are released. <br><br>  Well, and finally I will inform you that we continue to work diligently on TypeScript support.  It is still too early to talk about any specific features, but, you can be sure, this language occupies an important place in the list of our priorities, and as soon as we have everything ready, we will let you know. <br><br>  That's all - now, when you know what new features will be in 8K, why not try them yourself?  Just <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ReSharper/ReSharper%2B8%2BEAP" title="http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ReSharper/ReSharper+8+EAP">download the distribution</a> and let us know what you think about it!  ‚ñ† </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/171773/">https://habr.com/ru/post/171773/</a></p>
