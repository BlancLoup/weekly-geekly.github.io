      The same article more reveals the connection of technology with clinical depression. <br><br>  Remember: we are not medical experts.  If you think you are experiencing depression, or you have mental problems, it is always better to consult a doctor first.  Well, reading this material can be one of the steps towards a <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/zdorovyy-son-4-soveta-ot-kosmonavtov/">healthy lifestyle</a> .  And this is a lot! <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">1. Internet</font> </h2><br>  Never before have we had such free access to knowledge, entertainment and news from around the world. <br><br>  At the same time, this comprehensive access led to the emergence of the so-called information overload, because our brain was not used to the constant flow of so much information. <br><br>  When we have informational congestion, the brain tries to adapt - it tries to get used to the frantic rhythm and the state of constant congestion.  That is why when you try to pull away from the World Wide Web for a while, life seems so slow and boring. <br><br>  Moreover, information congestion is a mountain of information that we need not only to comprehend, but also to divide it into necessary and useless.  Due to the fact that the brain is getting used to overvoltage, we begin to look more and more for something new - something that we have never seen before. <br><br>  Psychologist Lucy Joe Palladino states: <br><blockquote>  When brain overexcitement becomes chronic, you begin to live in a state of constant and <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/6-stressogennykh-mysley-i-kak-s-nimi-borotsya/">unresolved stress and anxiety</a> , it becomes more difficult for the brain to process more and more information. <br></blockquote>  Studies on the connection of the Internet to depression, started in 2010 at the University of Leeds, revealed: <br><blockquote>  Our research has shown that excessive use of the Internet is directly related to depression, but we have not yet figured out what appears first - does a person in a state of depression go to the virtual world, or does the Internet become the cause of depression? <br>  It was also found that sites designed to replace live communication lead to psychological disorders such as depression and dependence. </blockquote><br>  But the Internet can be useful in treating depression.  Many communities and groups have been created that help people fight depression.  But even despite this, it is worth remembering that the Internet can and cause the opposite effect. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">2. Smartphones</font> </h2><br>  Phone addiction is a subtype of Internet addiction, which is quite common in the modern world.  We love smartphones, and if we had to live even a day without them, many would feel discomfort. <br><br>  Thanks to smartphones, we can access the Internet from anywhere.  We are always connected with our gadget - we often review web pages or write to a friend.  And if someone says that there is nothing wrong with such a superconnection, then there will be those who argue with that. <br><br>  In 2012, the University of Gothenburg found that excessive attachment to gadgets leads to mental and physical illnesses: <br><blockquote>  Excessive attachment to the phone violates the sleep pattern in men and causes depression in men and women. </blockquote><br>  The combination of computer and telephone addiction only worsens the condition. <br>  And in 2015, Baylor University found out why people are so <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/10-urokov-kotorye-ya-izvlek-posle-togo-kak-stal-ispolzovat-smartfon-60-minut-v-den/">dependent on their gadgets</a> : <br><blockquote>  Studies have shown that those people who use smartphones more often are more prone to the state of dejection, materialism, and have less concentration. </blockquote><br>  Like drug addiction, telephone addiction can improve one's mood ... Checking mail, correspondence with friends, sending tweets and surfing the Internet can only briefly distract a person from problems and ensure peace of mind. <br>  As a result, telephone addiction and everything connected with it are futile attempts to fight depression and improve one's mood. <br><br>  Unfortunately, this helps only in rare cases, and most often only distracts from real life. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">3. Social networks</font> </h2><br>  In moderation, social networks are a wonderful thing.  They allow you to stay in touch with friends and family, participate in interesting discussions and stay up to date with the latest news and trends.  It sounds very good. <br>  But there is one ‚Äúbut‚Äù: for many people, visiting Facebook can cause a bad mood.  You feel jealousy looking over the lives of more successful and wealthy people, and this can lead to depression. <br><br>  People have already noticed this repeatedly, but in 2015, research at the University of Missouri confirmed user unrest: <br><blockquote>  By accessing Facebook to see how well a friend or old friend lives well, people often feel jealous, and this leads to depression. <br>  We have noticed that if a person feels jealous when observing his friend‚Äôs beautiful life, he is more inclined to share his depressive thoughts on the net. </blockquote><br>  Dependence on social networks becomes a problem when people start to feel anxious every time they leave their own comfort zone.  Most often, this condition is described by the terms nomophobia (fear of being without a phone) and FOMO (fear of missing something). <br><br>  In short: social networks are beautiful, thanks to the communication possibilities that were not there before, but, on the other hand, they give us a false picture of someone else's good life - and users start to feel like losers and get depressed.  But it is worth remembering that no one will share their failures on the net, and a beautiful life on Facebook is only a small part of someone else‚Äôs life, which may not be as beautiful as we might think. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">4. Pornography</font> </h2><br>  After conducting a survey on the Internet about how often users watch pornographic content, we were shocked.  Of the 793 respondents, 37% admit that they watch porn "once a week", 33% - "every day", and 10% do it several times a day.  This means that of the 80% of people who view materials for adults, only a small part does this no more than once a week.  The survey was not conducted for scientific purposes, but it proved that many people watch porn. <br><br>  Unfortunately, research has shown that viewing porn harms the brain by altering the neural pathways and changing behavior and personality: <br><blockquote>  Scientists have discovered that our brain is like an endless game of Tetris, in which the blocks are our memories and experiences. <br>  Like narcotic substances, porn fills the brain with dopamine.  But, because the brain suffers from an overabundance of chemicals coming from watching porn, it tries to resist and drowns out some dopamine receptors. <br>  The brain of porn lovers is adapting to a new level of dopamine and the amount of dopamine that was previously considered redundant is not enough now, so a person begins to feel depressed after a long rejection of pornography. </blockquote><br>  The good news is that such brain changes are only temporary: <br><blockquote>  Neuroplasticity works in both directions.  This means that, having got rid of the addiction, the brain will return to its previous state. </blockquote><br>  This is not to say that watching porn leads to depression, but it can aggravate it.  Many people jokingly say that porn has relieved them of depression, but much more often it is possible to hear that a person has gotten rid of depression just by ceasing to look at adult materials. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">5. Game addiction</font> </h2><br>  Another area of ‚Äã‚ÄãInternet entertainment that can worsen depression is computer games.  Of course, you can play just by enjoying the game, but, based on the experience of many people, game addiction is also worth taking into account as a real threat to health. <br><br>  Studies in 2012 have shown a link between games and cases of severe depression: <br><blockquote>  Users of online games who sit for hours in online battles have more noticeable symptoms of depression, social phobia and Internet addiction. <br><br>  The fair sex players spend less time playing games, but are more susceptible to somatic pain and social fears. <br><br>  The more hours a person spends playing online games, the more likely he is to get a mental breakdown. <br>  Like many forms of entertainment, video games are a form of escapism.  For some, this is a way to get away from their own responsibilities.  For others it is an opportunity to forget about some unpleasant moment from real life, such as the general state of unhappiness. <br>  Constant spending time with MMORPG games or dopamine jumps from winning in online competition can bring temporary relief, but not solve the accumulated problems. </blockquote><br>  Like many distracting entertainment, online games only drown out the depression.  And when love for them turns into addiction, it can provoke problems with communication, lowered self-esteem, deterioration of physical and mental health, the emergence of shame or regret.  All this will only worsen the condition of depression in the addict! <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">The good news: depression is not the end!</font> </h2><br>  Instant remedies for depression are not yet invented, but it can still be cured with the help of professionals! <br><br>  On the other hand, if you feel that you are not completely depressed, there are several ways to reduce the negative impact.  For example, try to find a hobby that can make you happier.  Incredibly, even a short time to rest can positively affect the internal state of a person. <br><br>  Do you agree with what is said in the article?  If so, how are you struggling with all sorts of addictions? <br><br>  PS We recommend another useful article on the topic of work on yourself - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-priderzhivatsya-balansa-v-virtualnoy-zhizni/">How to stick to balance in virtual life</a> . <br><br>  The author of the translation is Vyacheslav Davidenko, the founder of the <a href="http://testutor.ru/">TESTutor</a> company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304184/">https://habr.com/ru/post/304184/</a></p>
