Part one</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  To tell you the truth, writing an article on one of the TM websites has not been in my plans to this day.  I registered with an occasion somewhere in 2012, whether to answer some kind of article, or to ask the author of this question.  I didn‚Äôt do either of these because of read-only, so I haven‚Äôt logged in since.  Today in the mailing list I found a link to the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/isma/" class="user_link">Isma</a> article ‚ÄúCancer.  What to do and what not to do.  Personal experience.". <br><br>  I read it very carefully, including comments, and could not restrain the desire to share my own experience in this matter.  Do not bring the **** will be useful to someone. <br><br><img src="https://i.snag.gy/0Igk7L.jpg" alt="image">

    <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">What is it?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Slice spiral computed tomography. <br>  Who will find the "white spot" from the article below, to the pie from the shelf, for what they found, but two stupid radiologists did not find. </div></div><br>  Interesting? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So the story is. <br><br><h4>  1. Prologue </h4><br>  It was 2011, and everything seemed fine.  The dream of <s>an idiot</s> about good work in a western company came true, the 29th anniversary of birth, a beautiful wife, a clever daughter who was just beginning to walk and regular fitness classes was not far off.  Actually from the last point my troubles began. <br><br>  Once leaving the gym, as it should be decently warmed up and reaching the house as it should be ‚Äúathlete‚Äù light on a cold September day, I caught a cold.  Life is everyday.  I must say that I have been forgiven for the last 10 years for any reason and always and everywhere, and the cold always ends with a long, two month cough.  It happened this time.  But work and business are not waiting, so there are plenty of trains on business trips for a month and noting that I‚Äôm not getting any better with the cough, I turned to the Moscow commercial clinic, which is considered to be a very cool one.  The benefit was good insurance.  Long story short: they defied me for a month or a month and a half, did a bunch of tests, two computerized tomography (CT), and began to cheerfully treat for pneumonia.  Having tried all the antibiotic lines on me and found out that for some reason they did not help me, they wanted to roll me on the third CT scan, but due to a happy coincidence, they didn‚Äôt do this, but instead sent them with the pictures to a very competent pulmonologist.  Carefully examining the pictures (*) and pointing a finger at the white spot between the heart and the right lung, said that ‚Äúthis‚Äù should not be here. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion number 1: detection of oncology is in many ways a matter of chance and often comes to light too late.</b> <br><br>  I can‚Äôt say that the world collapsed for me on that beautiful day.  Not.  There were explanations in my head that this could not be, because it could not be in principle: except for myopia and scoliosis, I am in principle healthy;  I do not smoke and never smoked;  I'm only 28 years old.  No, and no, no, this is probably something else, but a cough, well, yes, there is, but he had been 20 times before that, and he himself passed.  Here it is necessary to give a remark that while I was examined and treated by muddlers from the polyclinic, I myself as a person prone to analysis and (self) digging according to the results of blood tests, as well as symptoms such as light weight loss, fatigue and night sweats (the so-called B-symptoms ) also came to the conclusion that we can talk about oncology.  It goes with an insignificant probability. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion number 2: that doctors, that patients are psychologically ready to accept any conventional diagnosis, but hardly admit the possibility of oncology</b> <br><br><h4>  2. "Cut to hell, not waiting ..." </h4><br>  So, to clarify, so to speak, the essence of the white spot with a tender halo of inflammation on CT, I was sent to a good state hospital, where I had a dialogue of the following content: <br><br>  -I: I'm here to you, respected imenek, to make puncture with a fine needle (**). <br>  -Dock: Eh, her ... we don't do that.  If you want a puncture, blow it to oncologists, and here we are cutting it in the normal way.  Yes, and why would you not have been there, let's nafig cut off, nothing good is there and you do not need it. <br>  -I: Umm ... unexpectedly, but they told me about the simplest operation.  Yes, and what oncology, why do I need them.  Well, okay, you just have to.  And how will you cut it? <br>  -Dock: Yes, we have all the fire!  A small incision on the side, we start robotics, turn on the monitors and cut everything out. <br>  -I: Well, what to do: let's. <br>  -Dock: "Come on."  We've got a line here, hang out for three weeks and come.  Only CT scan before hospitalization. <br><br>  Having done another CT scan I was upset.  "White Spot" for a month vymahalo twice.  The preliminary diagnosis was the unknown to me then the phrase "T-lymphoma."  Googling sabzh.  my mood was completely spoiled.  Doubts about the essence of the spots disappeared, but the forecast was not pleasing.  The question of cutting or not, if it still remained by that moment, dropped somehow by itself.  I remember how I counted the days until the moment when they rid me of this filth. <br><br>  The moment has come.  True, before plunging me into anesthesia, Doc said that the concept had changed a bit: instead of a sparing operation with a robot, I would be opened in the old manner by the method of medial longitudinal cutting of the sternum <i>(that is, about how fish are cut)</i> .  Papers supposed to sign then.  It seems at that moment I asked the question ‚ÄúWhat about the robots?‚Äù And ‚Äúturned off‚Äù me on this positive note.  And when "turned on" I learned that I now have no lobe of the right lung, heart bag, and the nerve responsible for the movement of the diaphragm had to "cut a little."  In addition, it suddenly became clear that such a seemingly insignificant bone in terms of the movement of a healthy person is like a sternum; in fact, it is extremely important for these very movements and hurts at the slightest manupulations with their hands.  It hurts, by the way, until now. <br><br>  There was, however, a reason for optimism: the tumor lay on one side of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0">aorta</a> , but fortunately did not have time to grow it, otherwise they would have cut off part of the aorta, which would be pretty bad for you. <br><br>  Offal, as usual, was sent to the laboratory, from which came a little more pleasant than before, the answer about the essence of the disease, namely the most "benign" subspecies of Hodgkin's Lymphoma.  The diagnosis was signed by some mega-professor. <br><br>  Much later, when I became probably one of the most knowledgeable nonmedical patients in the world, I learned that in the world no one heals lymphoma in this way (that is, using the complete cutting method).  (***) But more about that another time. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion number 3: Caesar Caesar.</b>  <b>I heard the keyword "oncology", go to oncologists, and went to the surgeons - they will do what they are paid for.</b> <br><br>  (*) neither before this incident, nor after, I have never seen a general practitioner who could read CT.  Everyone reads only extracts to the pictures. <br>  (**) so-called  fine needle aspiration <br>  (***) To this day, I am tormented by doubts whether a radical operation was necessary or not.  On the one hand, I was not completely cured, on the other hand, the huge and main focus of the tumor and intoxication was removed. <br><br>  <i>It is getting late and the light bulb is dimmer.</i>  <i>This concludes the first of the N series.</i>  <i>Next time, if it takes place, I will tell you about where to go in order to never be afraid of horror films, about the absolute benefits of ‚ÄúN + 1 opinions‚Äù, and also about what a protocol in oncology is and how useful it is to get into it. .</i> <i><br></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399249/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399249/</a></p>
