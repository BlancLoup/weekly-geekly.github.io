What pleases me most in it? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/501/6c7/c75/5016c7c7570e287a53d9f046f75a2bae.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  - e-Ink of the second generation, rather contrasting, without residual traces of the previous page.  You are not looking at the LCD, but at the real physical objects - black and white balls.  It is very important for the safety of the eyes. <br>  - direct (without conversion) support for all natural formats, txt, html, rtf, fb2, zip, pdf, djvu, jpg, mp3 <br>  - lack of proprietary firewood and programs, a consequence - support for any OS without software installation.  You can download books in Linux, MacOs, Windows, on any of your own or someone else‚Äôs computer.  Or directly to the book to save from the browser <a name="habracut"></a><br>  - two scaling modes ‚Äúinconvenient‚Äù pdf <br>  - 155 g weight with a screen of 800 * 600, quality with a black and white photograph <br>  - does not require a separate charge, because it is sufficiently recharged from usb while I download books <br>  In addition, I am pleased with the lack of the need to turn it off.  The ARM processor on the Linux kernel allows it to live autonomously, without shutting down, for 100 days, or to turn over 10,000 pages.  I usually upload new books more often than once every 100 days, so for me it means - it never requires charging and shutting down.

      The kernel linux, although it loads quickly, but still has a load time.  What for?  Now you can <b>simply not turn off.</b>  And the book itself ryuhaet that it does not read - and ceases to redraw the clock.  The text of the page is still perfectly visible. <br><br>  Well, and this is real - the first book where you can read scientific books with graphs and Balitians in pdf, without losing sight.  What contributes to the right Ukrainian software - praise the famous Levchenko and the entire development team from Ukraine. <br><br>  In short, when she went on sale, I exclaimed - this is it!  Hooray!  And, regardless of the price, I bought it.  I've been waiting for this for a long time.  (I have been interested in electronic books for 11 years, exactly from the beginning of the RocketBook. Until recently, I read from the cult device REB1100. But the 20th century has passed, the times of MS DOS 5.0 have passed, the time of proprietary formats is running out - and I changed the book.) <br><br>  A year has passed.  What are my shortcomings and problems? <br><br>  The most important thing - as it was used and filled (gig books, including small-sized html, on a card (that is, tens of thousands of files), and almost gig inside), the book began to hang.  And in a crowded subway car, it is not very convenient to get it out of the case and look for a pin or a toothpick among the passengers to get into the Reset socket.  Reformatting the memory and full reloading of the content did not help, and I decided to patch it. <br><br>  I have to say, I tried four patches.  On all but the last, the problem was repeated.  I downloaded the latest patch in the forum, not yet past official testing.  And - oh joy - he helped.  I tell the details: <br>  I have an app, bought a year ago, this is a modification of the Pocketbook 301+: <br>  hardware platform: EBR-600 <br>  Software Version: E301.11 <br>  You need to take fw301plus12r7.zip - that is, the 7th modification, the test version (as of September 2009, the last release is 12r6). <br>  Direct link to download <a href="http://ifolder.ru/13523163">ifolder.ru/13523163</a> (install the test firmware at your own peril and risk). <br><br>  All links where to take here: <a href="http://delicious.com/dinozavr/PocketBook301">delicious.com/dinozavr/PocketBook301</a> <br>  Download the contents of the archive (or just the SWUPDATE.BIN file) to the root of the SD card, insert it into the book, reload the book on nutrition by holding down the + button on the right side of the book.  When the Linux kernel boots, an update will go - the button can be released.  EVERYTHING!  You can also download dictionaries or screensavers from the Internet, as well as update games (from ZIP). <br><br>  I emphasize that only 12r7 helps from constant freezes.  This is not found anywhere in the forums or in the documentation.  There is no description of this in the fixed features.  So - try it.  Glad if this helps you. <br><br>  In conclusion, I say that I do not read from the screen.  In addition, I love the look of the pages of the book, the drawings in it, look at the cover, finally.  Therefore, PocketBook for me is a real salvation.  Horseradish, I would have overcome such books that are not published (and will they ever be published?) On paper, like Rozov A.A., ‚ÄúAlien in a Stranger Sea‚Äù - 3000 pages from the screen is no joke.  And then - easily. <br><br>  In short, I hesitated for a long time because of the price.  But once strangling the toad and buying such a book, no one regretted it.  Especially if your profession is related to working at the monitor.  With her, the rest behind the monitor is also not rational.  eInk, by contrast, is a real physical object, viewed in reflected light - as a black and white page of a regular printed book.  This is a completely, completely different thing. <br><br>  This is a device that the farther, the more it becomes necessary and effective. <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/68656/">https://habr.com/ru/post/68656/</a></p>
