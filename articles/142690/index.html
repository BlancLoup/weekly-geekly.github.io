  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How does a programmer think</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The way of thinking affects the perception of the environment - this is a fact.  Nevertheless, this fact is usually not taken into account and certainly not analyzed deep enough, in relation to everyday life.  It seems strange to me, since any interaction with the outer world, as well as feedback with it, depends on our perception.  As a result, we all usually don‚Äôt even think about what our life, our environment and emotional state depend on. <br><br>  Although it may still not all of us?  Perhaps for programmers with such introspection things are a little different?  I hope that this is so, and such thoughts do not arise from me alone.  As a more illustrative example, I will make a little self-examination here, maybe it will help someone to look at everyday things a bit from the other side.  Maybe my thinking is really wrong and the community will point it out to me.  Everything can be, but for now it‚Äôs too early to sum up any results, so let's get down to it! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  How does a programmer think </h4><br>  Answering this question will have to tell a little about yourself.  No, I do not write in C # and do not really delve into all the tricks of reverse programming and other delights.  My tool at the moment is PHP, java-script.  Of course, I am familiar with other languages, but I work closely together for now only with these.  Having reached a certain level of immersion, I realized that I did not want to link the rest of my life with programming and stopped.  No, this is not stagnation.  Naturally, I study new nuances, libraries, frameworks, etc.  but I still leave a lot of time for myself to explore other directions that interest me.  The level I have attained is completely enough for me to proudly identify myself as a family of programmers. <br><br>  Let's still go back to the topic.  How do I think?  First of all, structured.  Many years of experience in using functions, classes, patterns, separating the front-end from the back-end leaves its mark on the psyche.  Let me assume that this is not even a trace, but a colossal restructuring of neural connections and algorithmic / logarithmic functions of the brain.  Naturally, these are just assumptions that are not based on any research, but it seems to me that this makes sense.  In any case, I can not deny the changes that have occurred in the very process of my thinking over the years.

      And so - what do we have?  The typical programmer‚Äôs thinking has the following characteristics: <br><br><ul><li>  it is structured </li><li>  there is a very sharp awareness of the causal effect </li><li>  global analysis is possible both of the essence of the problem, and local - of its individual components </li><li>  consciously created "behavioral patterns" for different situations </li><li>  hypertrophied the value of logic, emotions are relegated to the background, or even completely removed </li><li>  high level of self-learning (although this is an innate function, I assume that many years of work as a programmer develops it) </li></ul><br><br><h4>  How does this affect his perception </h4><br>  I suppose that we are programmers, it is easier to perceive the world as it is.  First of all, because, thanks to the high degree of analytical components of our thinking, we are able to break through the barriers of information noise and see things in their true appearance. <br><br>  I think many of us sometimes go to thoughts about the artificial nature of our world - this is due to the fact that we ourselves create our own worlds.  Someone small, someone large, but the principle is the same.  Potentially this is a dangerous quality.  In the future, this may provoke the development of various mental disorders - such as, for example, schizophrenia. <br><br>  A separate aspect of the perception of the world by a programmer is his detachment from the emotional component.  On the one hand, this may seem to be a plus, as it allows resolving various conflict situations to a measure calmly and beneficially for all parties or to work effectively in conditions of heightened tension.  On the other hand, there may be problems in your personal life.  Imperceptibly getting used to the constant blunting of their own emotionality, the programmer ceases to notice this, and loses control.  The effect is a huge percentage of high-end single professionals. <br><br>  Another consequence of diminishing emotionality is the distortion of the perception of the external world.  Without joy, love, sadness or anger - it turns into the technogenic, gray-green world of the Matrix.  Work, sleep, work ... It seems to me that this situation will please very few people. <br><br><h4>  What the universe returns </h4><br>  He is a programmer in India - a programmer.  In my opinion no one will argue with that.  Few of our fraternity live in poverty.  Even if - it is most often a conscious choice.  I think, due to their acquired qualities, programmers can achieve significant heights if they want. <br><br>  This is where the most interesting moment of my reflections is contained.  The combination of these qualities provides the programmer with a unique opportunity to correctly define their life goals at a sufficiently early stage. <br><br>  And she, the totality, makes it possible to make adjustments to the problem, or potentially dangerous for the individual elements of perception. <br><br>  Simply put - in my deepest conviction, programmers are themselves excellent psychotherapists and psychoanalysts.  But again - only if they want it. <br><br><h4>  Afterword </h4><br>  This topic is naturally touched on here very superficially, and requires experiments to confirm (or refute) the set hypotheses, but for me personally, this is all very close to what is happening inside. <br><br>  I am very pleased that at one time, being a child, Pascal was carried away and continued on his way along the programmer despite numerous obstacles.  Otherwise, I would be a different person. <br><br>  I am also pleased with my decision not to get a higher education.  Thanks to this, I can study what I need, to the extent that I need and in the mode that suits me.  And my brain is not clogged with outdated presets and patterns.  What and all I wish. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142690/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142690/</a></p>
