Increasing the cost of attracting customers reduces the business income to zero.  Endless competition is an economic deadlock and the extinction of business.  This is an article-case about working on the site of the Moscow team of repairmen, finding a niche that reduces competition, and turning a sales funnel into a well.  Read and use in your projects! <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  About client </h2><br>  The Cosmo-Repair team is a small, stable team of specialists in the construction industry, which provides apartment and house repair services in Moscow and the region.  Differs in acceptable quality of work, work in the lower price range and fairly simple repairs.  Yes, they do not offer their design solutions, it is necessary to argue in detail what eventually should happen and they should be visited periodically and control the correctness of the repair direction, but this is definitely the cheapest solution on the market.  And they have a serious plus, saving the customer's time - their own car for delivery.  So do not go with them through the markets for supplies. <br><br>  The site was absent.  There were independent attempts to advertise in the network - ads on Avito.  But the response was insignificant and only small orders (up to 7000 r), for the sake of which it was already unprofitable to go even to the neighboring region.

    <h3>  Tasks that the client has set </h3><br>  At the beginning of work, the number of orders from the Internet was close to zero.  The company lived only at the expense of regular customers and their recommendations.  A stable small stream of orders with small bursts that will load the team at the end of the next repair is required.  It is with these conditions that the IKS Digital agency began its work with the customer. <br><br><h2>  Site Kosmo-Remont.ru before and after </h2><br>  For representation in the network was created landing on CMS WordPress.  The budget was modest and the site fit him.  About the promotion of the original speech was not.  The site had a minimum of content and there was no opportunity to expand the number of pages.  Before proceeding further, we had to fulfill several priority technical tasks: <br><br><ul><li>  Conduct a technical optimization of the site and create the necessary service files </li><li>  Fill the site with content trustworthy visitors (portfolio, guarantees, about the company, etc.) </li><li>  Create a blog - for posting SEO articles </li><li>  Install all sorts of additional plugins. </li></ul><br>  During the work on the site its content has been completely recycled.  It should be understood that only technical changes are difficult to achieve good performance - there are many such sites on the network.  Therefore, to change the site, as well as to promote it, a customer-oriented approach was implemented: <br><br><ul><li>  Add realistic feedback describing the key benefits of working with the team. </li><li>  Adding galleries and photos to the site. </li><li>  Additional feedback forms and contact phone in different parts of the site and blog. </li><li>  Focusing visitor attention on key benefits (pricing, etc.). </li><li>  New blocks with answers to visitors' questions (guarantees, prices, quality, examples).  The scheme is simple: I realized that I care about the visitor - I found the answer - I gave it on the site. </li></ul><br>  In the context of this article, we will not delve into the creation of landing pages in particular - this is the topic for a time to divert a separate publication.  It should be understood that to create an advertising campaign or implement SEO website promotion, which is not effective enough - a waste of time and resources.  The study of the target audience and its ‚Äúhotelok‚Äù - the basis for the site upgrade. <br><br><h2>  Communication with the client </h2><br>  Communication with the client is the most important thing in the work of the Internet agency.  To understand what the client‚Äôs customer really wants, from the words of the client himself, is practically an art that beginners like to neglect so much.  The client knows that he wants profit, but he doesn‚Äôt really think about what his clients want.  All the complexity of contact with the customer is to build a communication channel, and to receive from him reliable and relevant data about everything that may be needed during the promotion.  Sometimes you just need to ask the customer to retell their conversations with the customer or, if the budget and business processes allow, to put ip telephony and listen to the negotiations.  This is the only way to recognize the pain of the customer‚Äôs customers and, through its elimination, convert them to the site. <br><br><h2>  Promotional budget allocation </h2><br>  With integrated promotion, we focus on the three main components of promotion: contextual advertising, SEO optimization, and site improvements for technical optimization and usability improvement.  First, distribute the budget in approximately equal shares. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/07e/d99/67c/07ed9967c3c010acfa7ed086bb65bfe2.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  SEO optimization begins to bear fruit only for 3-4 months, but by this time the business may die and we will lose a client.  For orders at the initial stage, contextual advertising is used.  In our experience, if there is enough traffic in the niche and the client does not need a lot of orders, then it is better to take only the highest-selling requests.  Also at the beginning of the promotion it is important to bring the technical characteristics of the site in order, to make the necessary service files for search engines.  After the appearance of contextual traffic on the site, we begin to follow the visitors through the web browser.  We look at what the query went and what they lacked on the site.  We try to answer all the most likely questions from visitors on the login page, i.e.  form landing page.  The formation of landing pages often requires the involvement of programmers to insert and rework blocks.  Fortunately, we have programmers on staff and are included in the cost of comprehensive promotion.  This saves the client from the search for additional specialists. <br><br>  Gradually, we reduce the share of expensive contextual traffic and the number of site improvements.  The whole emphasis is now on SEO optimization, which is strategically and economically correct. <br><br>  Traffic is important to attract and attract thematic.  When everything is set up well, the cost of the visitor is not reduced.  Next comes the conversion site.  It can be on average from 0-10%.  This is a huge niche to reduce the cost of lead.  Work on all two stages of the sales funnel (traffic and website conversion), which the agency can influence, and gives a synergy effect. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/849/cc0/f66/849cc0f66694a1a6bbcfc91f3c7f4d7c.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  All this allows the agency IKS Digital to ensure an increase in the number of visits and a drop in the cost of the lead. <br><br><h2>  Nishivanie </h2><br>  The company took on all types of apartment renovation and tried to ‚Äúembrace the immense‚Äù.  According to the foreman, emphasis should have been placed on redecorating.  We did contextual advertising for cosmetic repairs.  Calls came, but they wanted one small things, such as glueing wallpaper and tint.  And the cost of attracting a client was no less than the average for the repair niche.  Redecoration did not pay off at all. <br><br>  What to do?  The price of lead in the construction and repair niche is high.  The only thing that can cover it is a large order, i.e.  complex repair of the apartment.  In the "people" such repair is called an apartment repair, and redecoration, and overhaul.  In the complex repair of apartments, there are also niches: expensive repairs, average prices, repairs with minimal customer involvement in control and procurement, and finally, the easiest and most inexpensive. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/775/d56/1d8/775d561d864cd44ce3dfd41aa7781803.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  The specialization of our client is the easiest and most inexpensive.  And even in this niche you can find a bottom.  When repairs are made for themselves, people try to work mainly with repairmen who have already done something to their friends.  But for repairs under the lease, people no longer worry so much when making a decision, they are more concerned about the price.  And lo and behold, in this niche we already have much less competition than just repairing apartments.  Niche found.  Yes, there is less traffic in it, but we don‚Äôt need much.  Now we only attract traffic from this niche and specialize the site for maximum conversion of such traffic. <br><br>  By striking down the key advantages of the client, we achieve increased conversion on the site.  This is important to do at the beginning.  This helps testing niche contextual advertising.  But after finding a niche, you need to do SEO optimization for it.  We had mistakes with the choice of a niche, re-indexing the site punished us with a wait of several months.  But who does not make mistakes, he has no experience. <br><br><h3>  Funnel in the well </h3><br>  The funnel is the loss of people at the stage of attracting traffic and its conversion on the site.  Ideally, you need to attract only those who need your product and convince them on the site that there is no point in looking further - maybe you are no better than others, but definitely not worse.  Each company has a niche in which it competes less with the rest.  It happens geography - there is always more trust and convenience of communication with neighbors than companies from the other end of the big city.  It happens price / quality - it makes no sense to spend time on considering unnecessary ratios to you.  It happens time to receive services.  Competition with everyone is a dead end.  Highlight the best and most marginal, move in this direction.  Do not be afraid to lose other directions.  If you have orders, you and them gradually pull. <br><br>  In the most elementary understanding, the first tool to reduce competition are the keywords that you use in your promotion.  It is not always ideal to clear traffic for your key niche, but having done this and combed the site for it, it is quite possible to increase the conversion of the site. <br><br><h2>  Algorithm of effective promotion </h2><br>  Once again we will repeat the whole path that each site needs to go: <br><br><ul><li>  Analysis of the customer's company, its ‚Äúhotelok‚Äù and opportunities. </li><li>  Analysis of the site (sometimes it is easier to make a new one than to upgrade the old one). </li><li>  Analysis of niche margins that the company can master. </li><li>  Work with finding a niche that will be the best in terms of frequency / competition. </li><li>  Search traffic by niche and context setting and SEO </li><li>  Work with site conversion.  Sharpening the site under the niche. </li><li>  Profit! </li></ul><br><h2>  Total </h2><br>  The results of work on the site of the Cosmo-Repair brigade are not surprising with a huge amount of traffic, extreme conversion or penny leads, but we achieved the main thing - provided the customer with a steady influx of customers based on his capabilities, needs and budget.  Constant small growth only contributes to the development of the site and the company as a whole. <br>  As for technologies and algorithms of working with sales funnel, the main thing here is not to try to ‚Äúembrace the immense‚Äù, but to find your most comfortable niche with an acceptable margin. <br><br>  You have read about the living example of such a search in this article.  If your product or service is really good, then you will have customers - all you need to do is step away from the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcompeting with everyone and occupy your own small niche that will allow you to develop other areas in the future. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/317754/">https://habr.com/ru/post/317754/</a></p>
