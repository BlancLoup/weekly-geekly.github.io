  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The experience of creating online media from Yuri Synodov</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <em>Yury Sinodov, persona of 2007, according to the results of the <a href="http://ezhe.ru/POTOP%2B%2B">Russian Online TOP ++</a> contest, talks about the formation of his Internet resource <a href="http://roem.ru/">roem.ru.</a></em>  <em>The main reasons for the success of the conversation are the following:</em> <br><ol><li>  the use of user-generated content, which allowed the project to be ‚Äúraised‚Äù by one person‚Äôs editors, </li><li>  highlighting the comments of people related to the material - which made it possible to receive comments from figures who had not previously been mentioned in the online media </li><li>  well-designed ‚Äúsecurity system‚Äù for anonymous users </li><li>  responsiveness of users on which roem.ru relies </li><li>  quality materials creator resource :) </li></ol><br>  <em>Also talking about:</em> <em><br></em> <br><ul><li>  <em>the specifics of the distribution of shares in the project,</em> </li><li>  <em>the specifics of the project itself as a business,</em> </li><li>  <em>sources of attracting visitors to a specific project and to Internet projects in general,</em> </li><li>  <em>future plans and surprises that already exist.</em> <br></li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  The web-based nature of the resource was decisive </h3><br>  - Began, Roem.ru, naturally from the fact that I left the previous work.  Several did not converge with Leha Andreev ( <em>chief editor of the <a href="http://webplanet.ru/">Webplanet</a> , where Yuri was working at that time - approx. PN</em> ).  It was, it seems, on April 11, 2007 immediately after the FTA, and on the 12th I began work on ‚ÄúRoy. <br>  No matter how funny it was, it was planned to launch in May, but as a result it happened only in early October due to various delays.  All these six months, Roy's idea crystallized.  At first, I intended to do something like the classic media, but then the emphasis shifted towards user sections ( <a href="http://roem.ru/type_insides/">Insides, Rumors, Postcards</a> ), which now give the greatest increase in attendance. <br>  The result was an interesting situation - I have to publish the actual postings of users so that they do not accuse me of being addicted to this or that company.  This is the main difference from Habr, where the value of the news is decided by the community's click reflexes. <br>  To this we must add that, on the one hand, Roy has an attractiveness, and on the other, it is a forbidden fruit, because the employees of companies do not actually have the right to disclose what periodically appears on the site.  On the other hand, quite chernukha (like Grekov) on Roem is not published.  Therefore, the site‚Äôs perception is twofold: on the one hand, it‚Äôs about business, and the information is reliable, and on the other hand, readers, especially when it comes to their places of work, have a desire to avoid such publications. <br>  Probably, some indicator of the relevance and interestingness of the project is that I communicated with Leha Andreev, and Denis Kryuchkov, and they were interested in me as an employee ( <em>as far as I understand, I mean as the creator of something like roem.ru , because Yury worked with Andreev before - note PN</em> ).  Not now, but sometime later, we may be cooperating.  But not now. <br>  - How important for success was the fact that this is a web-dance resource? <br>  - Still, really defining - alone, I would not be able to write so much content, and it helps not to give up on the resource for users to hand.  I put on the quality of the content, and because of this, there are only a few news per day. <br><h3>  Potential investors do not want to pay time to create a resource. </h3><br>  - Quickly enough I managed to find people who supported the project.  However, this support is not so principled, since the project began to pay off in the very first month.  By ‚Äúpaying back‚Äù I mean my comfortable existence and the opportunity to sit in cafes, as it is now :) <br>  The first advertisers were the Adriver network and the Rorer contextual advertising system; now there are also ‚Äúspecialized‚Äù sponsors on the resource. <br>  It would be interesting to let your friends try to advertise any electronic consumer goods on the resource, for example, laptops - the subject matter is adjacent in principle - and see if this will have any effect.  While I can not show how advertising on Roem.ru affects the sales of a product or service, it is necessary to collect cases.  I hope it will boast. <br>  As for the share, investors have it less than mine, and, probably, this is optimal for Roem - I do not feel that I work for my uncle. Probably, if we count the number of hosts by the number of employees, then I will have the best one of the best indicators among the industry sites. <br>  (I think it‚Äôs correct to compare only webdvolol resources, because it‚Äôs understandable - where users generate content, this content will be significantly more than the editorial staff creates. And it‚Äôs still a matter of resource policy. , affects a minority of its visitors, and if they all stop working, this will not significantly affect attendance. But the figure will improve a lot :) - approx.  P.N.) <br>  Offers for sale have been received, but while the resource is growing, selling it is probably wrong.  If we talk about the price, then once the conversation was about the following: investments in <a href="http://telnews.ru/">Telnews</a> , launched in the summer of 2006, have now amounted to somewhere around $ 100,000. I have a result 2 times better (bypassing it in attendance in 2 months) means the sum is thousands of $ 200 at least ( <em>smiles</em> ) <br>  However, nobody is ready to pay this premium.  Typically, investors are willing to pay only the costs of staff salaries in the future. <br><br><h3>  Active audience appears quickly enough </h3><br>  - The main source of the audience resource was my <a href="http://sinodov.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a> .  Over the six months (since leaving Webplanet to launch), the audience of its regular readers has increased from 100 to 350 people.  Of course, it was time-consuming, but the fact that I was constantly writing something there eventually paid off, because all these people eventually switched to Roem.ru. <br>  In the first days, 300 people registered, now there are about 1,200, and about 800 are active. How much is ... compared to Habrahabrom is not enough, there seems to be more recorded per day.  If we compare it with ‚ÄúWebplanet‚Äù, the result is probably comparable. <br>  Growth has generally exceeded my expectations. <br>  But the point is probably that the active audience flows and makes itself felt fairly quickly.  When Lech Andreev and Masha Formanyuk went on vacation in August, and Lech asked to look after the Veblanet, I decided - and why not, despite my planned project.  And quickly enough, the number of comments increased, discussions started.  This is the most active flew like flies on honey.  Or what I offered them there. <br>  If you go back to Roem.ru, with regard to the sources of visitors, there were several successful arrangements: <ul><li>  banner advertising at conferences.  For Highload (probably, ClientSide is meant, because Highload took place before the opening of roem.ru - note PN), Rogozhin himself ordered the conference (organizer of the conference), the result was an interesting situation when ordered by him 3x2 banner turned out to be the biggest one at the event, people gathered next to it, took pictures.  Advertising was also at the Ashman conference, before it I specifically paid increased attention to the topic of search engine optimization, so that people would come and see that the resource was for them. </li><li>  The advertisement on <a href="http://rutube.ru/">rutube helped</a> .  Their contribution turned out to be quite significant, they gave, probably, a quarter or even a third of transitions. </li></ul><br>  <em>To be continued‚Ä¶</em> <br>  <em>Prepared by Pavel Nosikov</em> </div>
