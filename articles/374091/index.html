Weather, politics and colds can spoil your mood as much as you like, but that is not important.  It is important that soon we will begin to sign documents with the unusual ‚Äú2018‚Äù, and on the night of December 31 to January 1 we will believe that everything will be new in a new way - better and more fun.  In order to have more fun during the New Year holidays, it was not in theory, but in practice, we prepared great discounts for the HyperX gaming peripherals.  Save, go through the games, which are postponed until later the whole year, the holidays!  For details about discounts, welcome under cat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k_/ks/ag/k_ksag5v52a1nsmr7dqe86tppza.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Here is evidence for you why 2017 was not a ‚Äúnikakuschy‚Äù, as it may seem at first glance </h2><br>  It is difficult to remember right away what 2017 was different from the rest in terms of computers and digital equipment, even if you are a ‚Äúprogrammer‚Äù.  But there is something to remember - a lot of good news, some not so pleasant and a bunch of events, which are spoken with the word "for the first time". <br><br><h3>  Laptops are so ‚Äúnobody needs‚Äù that they are now even produced by smartphone makers. </h3><br>  If in past years we observed how computer vendors hit the production of mobile phones (Dell, GIGABYTE, Acer, HP, Viewsonic and others like them), then <s>in Soviet Russia</s> today the creators of smartphones have mastered the production of mobile PCs.  Immediately, two Chinese smartphone giants, Huawei and Xiaomi, got ultrabooks back in 2016, and then it seemed to everyone ‚Äúthe guys are just experimenting - if Sony refused to make computers, and LG and Samsung stung production to a minimum, there is nothing to do in this market‚Äù.  But 2017 showed that the Chinese didn‚Äôt give up their intentions - Huawei gave birth to three models, Xiaomi refined last year‚Äôs ultrabooks and released a ‚ÄúChinese MacBook Pro‚Äù with a 15-inch display and a flagship quad-core processor.  Speaking of processors.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6t/n1/_u/6tn1_uxofso352ueyy1eizrrwzm.jpeg"><br>  <i>The Chinese reinvent the MacBook, and do it for the second year in a row</i> <br><br><h3>  Ultrabooks have become more powerful, game models are thinner </h3><br>  After classic laptops were relegated to the background, and all manufacturers began to invest in ultrabooks (ultrathin long-playing models), processors in mobile PCs immediately became "fat-free" - with a very compressed heat pack of 15 W, in which you can‚Äôt time "ultrabook" Core i7 barely reached the desktop Core i3.  And even in comparison with processors for gaming laptops, the performance of ultra low-voltage chips was not impressive. <br><br>  But in August 2017, a strange thing happened - for the first time in 8 years, Intel decided to make ultrabook chips radically faster and doubled the number of cores in the older Kaby Lake Refresh models.  Thus, the Core i7-8550U and 8650U came into being - models in the previous 15 W thermal pack, but with 4 high-frequency cores about 8 threads.  So that you understand, these are chips that ‚Äúswing‚Äù at the level of a full-fledged desktop quad-core Intel Core i5-2500K without overclocking.  In the finest hardy ultrabooks! <br><br>  And gaming models finally began to lose weight - NVIDIA was worried that the nuclear suitcase igrobuki in the form factor was sluggishly buying and developed the concept of Max-Q.  This is a tricky control of the frequency of the video accelerator and undervoltage in the discrete graphics of powerful igrabukov.  And still new layout of the cooling system in the case of gaming laptops.  For what?  To overcome the problem of high heat generation and "obesity" of powerful gaming laptops. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cj/4b/nt/cj4bntscn1q9_wohftx2xbwavf0.jpeg"><br>  <i>Laptop on the NVIDIA Max-Q platform (top) compared to its predecessors</i> <br><br>  What is most surprising, NVIDIA has achieved its goal with minimal losses - mobile GTX 1080 with the flagship notebook Core i7 now get along in an 18-mm-thick case and do not trot.  Yes, the noise in the laptop is inhuman, and the ergonomics in these laptops are also strange (the keyboard is in the ‚Äúsimple‚Äù laptop), but you get unbeatable in games at 1080p and suitable for 4K gaming with a thick MacBook Pro 15 ‚Äù, and that's cool. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vb/rp/qe/vbrpqejafm-xq_hc6owknh84ugg.jpeg"><br>  <i>Strange design, but very high performance in a case as thick as a simple 15-inch non-gaming model.</i> <br><br><h3>  Processors and video cards in desktop computers - mining excitement and the fruits of finally competitive AMD </h3><br>  Cryptocurrency rates in 2017 went into a "vertical takeoff" - they talk about it so often that <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/291289/">we will not</a> tire you out and <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/291289/">repeat</a> .  For everyone who is not keen on mining, such realities mean unreasonable prices for video cards for desktop PCs throughout the second half of 2017.  In December, discrete graphics are not as overvalued as they were in the summer after Ethereum grew in popularity, but the market for video cards has still not returned to normal market prices. <br><br>  On the other hand, desktops in 2017 no longer look like the ‚Äúmonopoly realm‚Äù of Intel and NVIDIA, and competition from AMD is the main victory for PC lovers in the past 12 months. <br>  In the second half of 2016, the "red" Intel responded with processors RyZEN - not so fast in terms of performance per clock, but much more "voluminous", that is, multi-core.  After modern Core i5 and Core i7 have long been non-alternative in terms of gaming performance, Reisen made noise.  Yes, such that Intel has hit the "devaluation" of its processors and released the Core i3 with the performance of the previous generation Core i5 (for the first time in 6 years!), And made the Core i5 and Core i7 six-core, so that AMD did not accidentally eat the market share of "blue" computing power and price. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yg/d9/yl/ygd9yldoouyoeu0wkx4b5p6jef4.png"><br>  <i>Since then, competition resumed in desktop processors</i> <br><br>  Given that AMD is already preparing to release the second generation of RyZEN, and the old Intel has finally begun to become obsolete (and not ‚Äú+ 5% of the performance once a year‚Äù) - the competition has already paid off. <br><br>  And in the graphics component, AMD finally got rid of the inglorious situation when there was nothing to ‚Äúcover‚Äù the GTX 1070, 1080 and 1080 Ti companies - with a large deficit and ‚Äúcreak‚Äù, but still the new Vega 56 and 64 saw the light. Very cool with In terms of architecture, "fresh" in terms of performance without overclocking, with a large margin of performance for overclockers - everything we love. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zi/_4/tr/zi_4trsjj1ejbpmqz5eakwkddwe.jpeg"><br>  <i>Now at least there is a choice</i> <br><br><h3>  Consoles did learn in 4K gaming </h3><br>  <i>More precisely, not only all the consoles - few could do it</i> .  And, nevertheless - Microsoft Xbox One X has returned respect for the "game consoles" even from the experienced PC fans.  Because the box with a customized AMD Jaguar processor, tons of memory for games (and not ‚Äúat the bottom‚Äù, as it was in the original Xbox One) and cost 40 thousand rubles, works at the speed of a gaming PC that will fly you to 100 thousand rubles.  Unlike a computer, the console cannot be called universal digital technology, but the Microsoft approach itself commands respect.  And no "nekstgenov", the change of generations of the console - all in the framework of evolution and upgrade.  Yes, yes, as on the PC. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hk/p2/sj/hkp2sjjy-scduzsj5x11egrjm9a.jpeg"><br>  <i>Consoles have come a long way from 900p resolution with a grief in half to 4K without problems</i> <br><br><h3>  HoshPoplakat, Petya and Wi-Fi Vulnerability </h3><br>  For a long time, Windows has not been so full of holes and with such consequences as in 2017.  Only the WannaCry cryptographer <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/289153/">infected more than 200,000</a> computers in 150 countries with a network vulnerability in the system.  Hospitals, telecommunications companies, factories fell under the distribution, and in Russia, MegaFon and Sberbank‚Äôs computer networks ‚Äúlay flat‚Äù.  Then, in the spaces of the former USSR, a similarly similar malware, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/290525/">Petya</a> , began to brutalize, and the fun with the ‚Äúpatched‚Äù Petya called Bad Rabbit ended.  As in the good old days with the dominance of the winlockers, Microsoft released a patch, the antivirus companies updated the signatures and promoted well, the users suffered, the admins received a portion of a headache - well, everyone had a great time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gh/eg/g0/ghegg0oz2omxctio1rlknbmdiyg.png"><br>  At first I was like ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rh/-i/_h/rh-i_hcjeif1itwqnfx-6ch99lw.jpeg"><br>  ... but then ... <br><br>  And in the fall, it was found that at the Wi-Fi access points that were protected with WPA2, you can easily listen to traffic due to a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/340180/">vulnerability in the ‚Äúhend-shirts‚Äù</a> , forgive our English.  The hole turned out to be so large-scale that both routers and clients need to be patched, which is almost impossible.  But network equipment makers jumped around and released a fix, and the widespread use of HTTPS saves a little from infection. <br><br><h3>  Mozilla Firefox "born again" and lost compatibility with most extensions </h3><br>  From the day when Opera capitulated and became the ‚Äúfork of Chromium‚Äù, a lot of time had passed, and now Firenell is fighting for survival.  The share of "our all" open non-commercial browser is constantly falling under the onslaught of Chrome, so from the strategy "can do everything, but slowly" Mozilla moved to more drastic actions and <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/295473/">radically updated their offspring</a> .  The new Quantum engine, amazingly high speed, an updated design and ... loss of compatibility with most of the classic extensions for which the geeks continued to cling to the Fox, and did not go to Chrome. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qy/5c/ny/qy5cnyyqxdrqywn_fdg5pzpfpis.png"><br>  <i>Changes in the design are not so noticeable, but the new engine is unrealistically fast.</i> <br><br>  The situation is complicated, developers update old extensions slowly and reluctantly, Mozilla risked a loyal audience for the sake of increasing popularity.  Hopefully, the browser will ‚Äúpop up‚Äù, and smart analogs or forks with similar functionality will come to replace popular extensions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oy/te/lf/oytelf6zaiuvzqhnv9hkeg6mjkc.png"><br>  <i>Firefox - browser without extensions.</i>  <i>Where have you seen it?</i> <br><br>  As you can see, even without deepening in the smartphone and b2b jungle in 2017, there was something to remember. <br>  Our readers and all fans of computer games deserve to spend the New Year holidays with pleasure and with good technology, so catch our "tasty" holiday discounts and wishes of all the best, warm and joyful in the new 2018!  Road spoon for dinner, and gaming peripherals - for the holidays!  Good games and memorable victories to all lovers of computer and console gaming! <br><br><h3>  Game headsets play sound in 7.1 format, and flash drives move 2 terabytes of data </h3><br>  For Kingston, 2017 was a special year - the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/289757/">30th anniversary</a> , after all (feel like an ancient old man, a buyer of RAM), but the company did not sit idly by, but was noted in the ‚Äúachievements of technology‚Äù. <br><br>  First, the HyperX Cloud Revolver flagship gaming headset with 7.1-channel surround sound (‚Äúon the fingers‚Äù explains how it doesn't work, but we tried) <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/288622/">received an update</a> ‚Äî without aggressive gaming design and with improved ergonomics, even more super- surround and "versatile" sound. <br><br>  Secondly, Kingston again set a USB flash capacity record when it released a 2 TB drive on board - the ‚Äúflash drive king‚Äù might not be crazy in the era of cloud storage and fast 4G Internet, but if you are an old man and you like access to a huge amount of data in minimum size drives - this is the fish of your dreams. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rf/sk/bx/rfskbxljynysphcv2w0i64rlkci.jpeg"><br>  <i>The most capacious flash drive in the world - Kingston DataTraveler Ultimate GT with 2 TB of memory</i> <br><br>  Thirdly, the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/292641/">Kingston KC1000</a> drive <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/292641/">has</a> become one of the fastest SSDs of the year.  Toshiba's new 15 nm memory, PCI-Express 3.0 x4 interface and NVMe protocol were needed by this monster to reach its potential.  The model is not for everyone, and rather for professionals than gamers.  But 3 GB per second for reading is not a toy for you, and in industrial conditions this speed will be just the way. <br><br><h2>  And now discounts! </h2><br><h3>  Read the entire list, please </h3><br>  It's time to save, ladies and gentlemen!  Distribution of gaming peripherals HyperX will last until January 14, 2018, in the leading roles of sales: <br><br>  <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeekSilverNY">HyperX Cloud Silver</a> is the updated legendary Cloud Core model.  The changes have affected the appearance: the headbands are now of steel color, and on the wire there is a volume control panel and microphone on / off.  The headset has become more attractive and functional.  And it affected the price quite a bit - Cloud Silver is only 500 rubles more expensive than its legendary predecessor. <br><br>  <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeekStingerNY">HyperX Cloud Stinger</a> is an inexpensive, but durable, beautiful and practical headset with very convenient sound control and a cool microphone for eSports players and anyone who is focused on gaming, sorry, domination.  Pleasant sound, good voice in the game, optimum resistance of 30 ohms.  A convenient option in order to feel comfortable in online contests, but not to spend money on cosmically expensive "clothing." <br><br>  <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeekPulsefireNY">HyperX Pulsefire FPS</a> is a gaming mouse with ‚Äú <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeekPulsefireNY">non-killing</a> ‚Äù switches, a fast sensor, a smart body and a minimum of decorations.  A working tool for winning in games, so everything is designed in such a way as not to distract from the battle, but to work for the result. <br><br>  <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeekAlloyNY">HyperX Alloy FPS</a> is a living classic of mechanical keyboards.  Steel construction, ‚Äúcut‚Äù to the maximum dimensions, to occupy less space and not be felt ‚Äúgrand‚Äù on the table, only the necessary keys with a huge margin of safety and Cherry MX Blue / Brown / Red switches to choose from - the most brutal sport-game thing that it is convenient to use every day without discomfort. <br><br><h3>  Where are the sales? </h3><br>  Our country is widespread, so the action is available at once in several network partner stores - everyone should be able to get HyperX accessories as close as possible to home and as quickly as possible. <br><br><h3>  Discounts are valid in partner stores: </h3><br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeekDNS">DNS</a> ; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeekEldorado">Eldorado</a> ; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeekMvideo">M.Video</a> ; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://hyperx.gg/Geek4FRAG">4FRAG</a> . <br><br><h3>  The size of discounts is as follows: </h3><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>1000 rubles discount</b> - for <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeekStingerNY">HyperX Cloud Stinger</a> headset <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>2000 rubles discount</b> - on <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeekAlloyNY">HyperX Alloy FPS</a> keyboard with Cherry MX switches (optional Brown / Blue / Red) <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>1000 rubles discount</b> - for <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeekSilverNY">HyperX Cloud Silver</a> headset <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>700 rubles discount</b> for <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeekPulsefireNY">HyperX Pulsefire FPS</a> mouse <br><br>  And in December you can buy Kingston A400 and UV400 120 GB SSDs with a pleasant discount in <a href="https://goo.gl/jKHkti">Citylink</a> and <a href="http://kingston.gg/GeekSales">Ulmart</a> stores. <br><br><hr><br>  For more information about Kingston and HyperX products, visit <a href="http://www.kingston.com/ru">the company's official website</a> .
