      - and also shared some details about the already known model, the January premiere of Xperia arc.  The premiere place is quite symbolic - a small room behind the showroom with Vaio laptops, a PlayStation prefix and Cybershot cameras, which contained only a big Bravia TV in half a wall, a case with novelties and a dozen journalists, are all connected with yesterday‚Äôs premieres of the day <br><br>  What is interesting to learn at this event? <br><a name="habracut"></a>  Let's start with the models Xperia neo and pro. <br><br><h4>  About neo </h4><br>  Neo is a classic candy bar of the average price category, which provides the user with all the features of the Android platform, coupled with the convenience of using a powerful smartphone with a large screen.  Potential new hit company. <br><br>  Xperia pro, the twin brother of neo, but in the more rare form factor of the side slider, is aimed at a narrower, but more targeted audience.  A larger keyboard than on a similar Xperia mini pro format and a larger number of keys themselves guarantee the convenience and speed of typing on it and promise that this time the Russian layout will fit entirely, without using upper case for some letters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/31f9f7f2/f8d678ec/011b051d/343d763b.png"><br><br>  The Type &amp; Send function changes the traditional typing order - first open the application (it doesn't matter if you are typing sms, twitter or LJ) and then typing in it - you can immediately go to the pro, open the keyboard, type, and then decide to send this text by email or save to notes. <br><br>  The keyboard itself on pro is traditionally convenient - convex separate keys (like on Vaio or the same mini pro) will not allow you to miss by or press two buttons at once.  By the way, the pro profile in the profile is approximately like an arc - this is explained by the fact that in the horizontal position the phone is more comfortable to hold in your hand due to the bulges on the sides. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/8cbda0f9/ade81c0c/8d2d4963/0fc02075.jpg"><br><br>  The same considerations of convenience and ergonomics dictate the shape of the Xperia neo - it, on the contrary, is convex in profile, which is more usual, for example, according to last year's models of the Xperia line. <br><br>  Both Xperia neo and Xperia pro are equipped with a camera with an Exmor R 8.1 MP resolution that captures high-quality HD video: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/9727de7f/2af6274c/f049081b/7f83d8e8.jpg"><br><br>  I already told you more about Exmor R technology from the world of Cybershot cameras in the arc review, but now I‚Äôll show you better how, for example, video footage looks on an ordinary Exmor R backlight matrix in comparison: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/VuFUHgiWBLQ&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgQcouLijLrY-8ac_JiaR2NuEhc9w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The HDMI connector with a meter wire in the kit allows you to connect your phone to a TV and watch it or even play games in the appropriate quality. <br><br>  Xperia neo will appear in showrooms at the end of March-April, and will cost up to 20,000 rubles, Xperia pro promise at the end of the second quarter. <br><br><h4>  Toy for adults </h4><br>  Xperia PLAY in life turned out to be even more interesting than in the description for the press after the premiere. <br><br>  First, in addition to the retractable gamepad, which practically allows the Playstation gamepad configuration (only instead of ‚Äúhemp‚Äù - two sensory fields under the thumbs), two more ‚Äúpetals‚Äù at the end of the phone help the games, with the gamepad extended they are on top, behind the screen and, respectively, it is convenient to control them with the index fingers.  And in any case, Xperia PLAY remains the first phone on which you can play comfortably without closing the screen floor with your fingers: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/6b98b848/6b581d95/4a7d4c13/1080c9e6.jpg"><br><br>  Secondly, the presentation showed a specially designed for the PLAY <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/sonyericssonsocial/DK300">docking station DK300</a> , which allows it to be used as, for example, a TV or a stationary alarm clock.  I haven‚Äôt managed to come up with any other appointments for her yet, the connectors at the station repeat the telephone ones - MicroUSB and 3.5 mm audio output.  But still a cool thing: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a3e6490f/d20110dd/b2c11357/991e7f17.jpg"><br><br>  Representatives of the company podvterdili that by the time the model enters the market of America and Europe, which is expected in March, 50 games specially prepared for the PLAY, including the most famous brands such as Assassin Creed, NFS, will be waiting for happy owners in a special section of the Android Market. FIFA 2010 etc.  With the function of multiplayer - so far only for the same owners of Xperia PLAY.  In Russia, sales will begin two months later, but there will be much more toys by May. <br><br>  The smartphone lacks only the HDMI output - but the 5 MP camera does not allow you to shoot HD video, and to connect to the TV for games, it is assumed that the PLAY owner already has a Playstation at home :) <br><br>  And for those to whom the first PLAY TV commercial seemed too provocative and frightening, a nicer and more positive second TV commercial, to which, however, you can also find something to complain about - for example, you might think that it provokes to violate traffic rules and drive along the usual roads like Need for Speed: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/JQqyUlQRB5g%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjsilXwrxzwretndg2-2etA2P46aQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Modelka will cost at the level of other top-end smartphones from Sony Ericsson. <br><br><h4>  Body shapes </h4><br>  As for the flagship of this year, Xperia arc, then nothing that was still unknown and not yet told about it, was not said - for a month and a half since the premiere, the novelty has already climbed and studied from all sides.  I remembered a joke explaining the choice of the concave profile of the back cover - since such large phones often carry in the back pocket, and a profile was chosen that fits your ass perfectly :) <br><br>  Another nice bonus is that despite the fact that the arc is equipped with a scratch-resistant screen, the phone is already equipped with a protective film at the factory - so if after six months you notice that there are still scratches on your screen, just <s>wipe the screen and</s> replace it with a film like New.  This applies to all phones of this year - to set aside trembling fingers and a film crookedly cut into cells of 500 rubles per several square centimeters! <br><br>  You can be convinced of this in all the salons next month. <br><br><h4>  And instead of an afterword </h4><br>  Another interesting report from the event with a bunch of photos is on the <a href="http://www.sony-ericsson.ru/forums2/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D62708">unofficial Sony Ericsson forum</a> . <br><br>  And at the meeting, I took on the test one interesting novelty, which has long been discussed in the network and now almost reached the Russian market.  A detailed review of the readers of this blog will see first;) <br><br>  See you again! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114033/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114033/</a></p>
