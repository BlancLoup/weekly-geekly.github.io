Progress does not stand still, and now, private astronautics has reached Russia.

      Habr likes publications about space, but traditionally they are treated like ‚Äúkitties‚Äù, i.e.  besides, it is pleasing to the eye, it pleases the soul, but has no practical application in life.  Now this time is passing, and Dauria has offers that may be interesting not only for those who want to make a career in the space industry, but also for free developers.  The time is approaching when the space can become for Habr not only interesting, but also profitable. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I will tell you in detail about each direction of the company, while a brief introductory review. <br><br>  The company was founded by Mikhail Kokorich from Transbaikalia.  He made a fortune in retail and a bunch of other start-ups, but at some point he decided to combine the dream of space and the desire to make money.  Mikhail, and his two classmates at the Physics and Mathematics School of the Novosibirsk State University, created the ‚ÄúDauriya Aerospace‚Äù.  The company received the name of the historical name of Transbaikalia.  The central office is located in Moscow on the territory of the Skolkovo Technopark. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6be/db5/6f2/6bedb56f2d07afbfff9d2b5f3869771b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  During one 2012, Dauria became an international holding, incorporating Canopus and German CloudEO into its membership.  In Russia, the company gathered a young but professional team, which allowed the launch of the first own space project DX-1.  In addition, in December 2012, the company won a state contract for the production of two microsatellites for Roskosmos, and the development of a means for locating CubeSat devices on Russian launch vehicles. <br><br>  The DX-1 satellite is an experimental device that is created as a universal small space platform for accommodating various types of payloads.  In addition, the ‚Äúfirstborn‚Äù is needed in order to work together a team, to establish a chain of suppliers and contractors, to test technologies and working methods.  A control program written for the satellite will be the basis for subsequent generations of devices.  DX-1 will fly with the receiver AIS signals - will monitor ships in the oceans.  This is the first Russian satellite with such functionality.  The launch will be passing, Roskosmos promises for December, but there is some probability that they will suffer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cbb/528/058/cbb528058c89963854772ba727d33e98.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The Automatic Identification System ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25B2%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0">AIS</a> ) is a means of exchanging navigation and registration information between ships via the VHF channel.  The flying satellite catches these signals, obtaining data from which it is possible to draw up a map of the position of the ships.  At each turn, information is sent to the receiving station on Earth.  The data are of interest to coastal services, shipowners, transport companies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f85/238/5fc/f852385fc06670bf54367b701a5923f6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There is also an aviation AIS, I think many used the service that was created with its help: <a href="http://www.flightradar24.com/">flightradar24.com</a> <br><br>  A more interesting project is <a href="http://zakupki.gov.ru/pgz/public/action/orders/info/common_info/show%3FnotificationId%3D4575681">the Kubsat-nano state contract</a> .  Immediately it should be noted that the ‚Äúnano‚Äù is not a tribute to the current fashion, but an international standard for the classification of spacecraft.  When applied to satellites, "nano" means "from 1 to 10 kg."  ‚ÄúKubsat-nano‚Äù is the second experience of Roscosmos in the creation, launch and operation of spacecraft of the CubeSat standard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/231/17b/e7f/23117be7f32ce4da36e1cc6d6ad04471.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Roskosmos "Kubsat-nano" is needed to gain experience operating the apparatus "overseas" standard CubeSat.  For Dauria, this is an ambitious project to create an Earth remote sensing apparatus of the CubeSat standard, which solves real applied problems.  For today in the world more than hundred cubsat are already launched.  And most of them are for experimental, educational, or even entertainment purposes.  Only a few carry out practical tasks, most often associated with the relay of radio signals.  ‚ÄúKubsat-nano‚Äù will be the first CubeSat to be engaged in professional multispectral imaging of the Earth‚Äôs surface.  Such information will be useful for the Ministry of Emergency Situations, agricultural and forestry.  The survey will allow analyzing vegetation using the HDVI algorithm, which is used, for example, when processing data from American satellites <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/183416/">Landsat</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/508/a7c/40e/508a7c40e4386c0c3aeafad743cfc6de.gif"><br><br>  The plans of Dauria Aerospace include the creation of several satellite groups for various purposes: Internet services;  remote sensing of the Earth, in different ranges and different resolutions;  information transfer for machine-to-machine interaction.  Services offered from them should be the main source of income for the company. <br><br>  Now, a few words about the case for developers. <br>  The German division of "Dauria" is creating a cloud-based software environment that will allow for more active use of satellite data, both in everyday life and in business.  Despite the fact that there are dozens of Earth remote sensing satellites in orbit today, we can give only a few examples of their widespread use: Yandex Maps, Google Maps, several meteorological resources, etc.  Most satellite data are highly specialized, for the specific needs of states or large commercial customers. <br><br>  The basis of the <a href="http://www.cloudeo-ag.com/">CloudEO</a> project <a href="http://www.cloudeo-ag.com/">is</a> as follows: all open data from NASA and ESA satellites are accumulated on servers, satellite data from other devices are purchased, and the results of the work of their own groups of Dauria Aerospace are added to them.  Purchasing and processing paid images is not cheap.  The idea behind CloudEO is to make expensive big shots more accessible in parts.  Conventionally, if one frame is now sold at $ 100, then with the launch of the system, you can sell the same information to 100 customers at $ 1. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/84f/7b7/b56/84f7b7b5616fc1487f439ec7c733c14c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Information on CloudEO servers becomes available for use in various applications that can be developed for everyone.  You can implement any ideas and monetize them by analogy with the AppStore: monitor the weather, check the cleanliness of water in the southern resorts or the condition of the snow cover, on the ski slopes, monitor the condition of the fields and predict yields, search for free parking in megalopolises, the least loaded slopes, and much another.  Opportunities will increase over time, as the number of working satellites increases, the quality and, most importantly, the frequency of shooting increases. <br><br>  At the initial stage of service development, it is possible to provide grants from Dauria Aerospace for application developers.  I guess this will attract the interest of many, but I ask you now not to fall asleep with questions.  I myself have not fully understood CloudEO, and the service is not ready yet.  When the time comes, I will sort it out and tell or give a specialist who will tell you better. <br><br>  In the company's blog on Habr√©, I will talk about how the work on the creation of spacecraft is progressing, and when they fly, how their work goes.  I will try to attract specialists who will be able to tell more technical details of the design, construction and control of spacecraft, and the development of space software. <br><br>  In general, the team in "Dauria Aerospace" is just great.  Just a year ago, I was envious of the black NASA JPL employees who had planted Curiosity on Mars for their excitement, passion, and unlimited interest in their work.  Today I no longer envy, because I myself work in the same enthusiastic team, and, hell, we also make space, and this happens at home, and not overseas! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b0a/0e2/689/b0a0e2689bd439f26862a30c7ef32ae9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, a little about yourself. <br>  Thank you Curiosity for the fact that I again, as a child carried away by space.  The fact that I came to Habr, thanks to the <a href="http://marstefo.ru/">Mars-Terraforming</a> project and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/cholgaa/" class="user_link">Cholgaa</a> personally, by the way, they continue to work and are waiting for curious guests who are greedy for Mars.  The fact that I and Dauria Aerospace have found each other, thanks to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/167865/">Electro-L</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/kapn614/" class="user_link">Kapn614</a> . <br>  In general, this year was an amazing chain of meetings and events that turned my life around, and Habr played an important role. <br><br>  Six months ago, I was eager to build my NASA <s>amusement park</s> from Roscosmos, with a website and PR people, but it didn‚Äôt work out.  Therefore, now I am building my SpaceX from Dauria.  The company is doing only near-earth vehicles for the time being, but I will do my best to move the private interplanetary program.  Any ideas about the moon, and then think of something for Mars.  It sounds presumptuous and fantastic, but my whole Habro-year is so fantastic that I myself can‚Äôt believe it, and I intend to develop an offensive against objective reality.  Times are changing, progress is coming, the cost of technology is falling, and we can talk about a new wave of space expansion, in which everyone can make a contribution. <br><br>  In other words: the future is here and for everyone, and let no one leave offended! <br><br>  <i>PS And, yes, Zelenyikot, does not change.</i>  <i>I have a lot of cosmic ideas and plans not related to work.</i>  <i>In the autumn we start to implement!</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/193578/">https://habr.com/ru/post/193578/</a></p>
