  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The last drop: Kickstarter first attracted a journalist to investigate the failure of the crowdfunding campaign</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The crowdfunding platform Kickstarter for the first time took up the investigation of the loud failure of the project.  The developers of the mini-drone <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/torquing/zano-autonomous-intelligent-swarming-nano-drone/description">Zano</a> raised $ 3.5 million via Kickstarter (this is the largest amount collected in Europe), and then announced the closure of the project. <br><br>  Drone ZANO was positioned as a ‚Äúpersonal paparazzi‚Äù.  By controlling his flight using gestures from your smartphone or tablet, you can take everything on the camera into his field of view.  However, the drone <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/21406/">did not meet the</a> commercial expectations of its creators. <br><br>  Kickstarter hired independent journalist <a href="http://www.meharris.com/">Mark Harris</a> to bring Zano developers to the clear. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to them, out of 15,363 drones (not counting 12,000 devices for backers), only about 600 copies were sold.  The quality of the devices leaves much to be desired: the drone has poor image quality, a weak battery, the lack of the stated autonomy maintenance functions and the commands ‚Äúfollow me‚Äù, ‚Äúhold position‚Äù.

      The first ZANO devices should have been received by the owners in June 2015, but this deadline the company violated and delayed the issue of devices for an indefinite period.  In the autumn, about 600 drones were sent to the sponsors of the crowdfunding campaign, but their functions were far from promised: the device could barely fly. <br><br>  ‚ÄúKickstarter asked me to talk about the company's progress - from the very beginning to the end - and answer the question of whether the Zano authors could do something different, whether they made mistakes that future projects on the site could avoid,‚Äù <a href="https://medium.com/%40meharris/an-unusual-commission-f5171a156a05">writes</a> Harris. <br><br>  Another task of the journalist will be to assess the role of the Kickstarter platform itself in the failure of the project. <br><br>  According to him, Kickstarter will pay him for his services and will not interfere with the process of writing the article.  Its publication is scheduled for mid-January 2016.  However, before publication, the journalist will transfer the text of the article to the ‚Äúproofreading‚Äù to Kickstarter representatives, who will not let random facts get in the way of a beautiful story. <br><br>  This is not the first failure of the project on Kickstarter.  In October, the crowdfunding platform <a href="https://hi-tech.mail.ru/news/laser-razor-skarp-blocked">closed a</a> project to raise funds for the creation of a laser razor <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/skarp/the-skarp-laser-razor-21st-century-shaving">Skarp</a> .  The reason is the lack of a full-fledged working prototype of the device.  More than 20 thousand investors have invested about $ 4 million in the project. <br><br>  As <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/12/11/kickstarter-hires-journalist-to-probe-collapse-of-zano-drone-project/">noted by</a> TechCrunch, the decision to conduct an investigation was made against the background of the publication of a new <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/fulfillment%3Fref%3Dhero">report</a> , which demonstrates that 9% of the crowdfunding campaigns launched at Kickstarter fail as a result and cannot fulfill the orders of their backers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297232/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297232/</a></p>
