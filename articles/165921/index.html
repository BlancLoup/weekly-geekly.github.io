  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Content orientation as trend 2013</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On the eve of the New Year holidays they like to write about trends for the next year.  In this sense, the current holidays were not an exception and a lot of articles appeared with forecasts for 2013. The most interesting, in my opinion, is the prediction that the content will become more and more significant. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Previously, there was an increasing emphasis on technology, various channels, social networks, the availability of devices.  But no matter how many breakthroughs arise and how quickly the audience would grow, it becomes obvious that we still run into the narrowest point - this is the content itself. <br><br>  The first attempts to draw significant attention to the content began a few years ago.  Excellent material was from David Giliss in 2010 " <a href="http://www.teehanlax.com/blog/modelling-content-strategy-with-content-flow-diagrams/">Modeling Content Strategy with Content Flow Diagrams</a> ".  Remarkable recommendations were February 2011 in Olya Gardner's infographic ‚Äú <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/the-noob-guide-to-online-marketing-with-giant-infographic-11928">The Noob Guide to Online Marketing</a> ‚Äù.  In his material, the content strategy was scattered throughout the media plan, but it was a deeply integrated process that affected different aspects of the site‚Äôs life throughout its existence. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      But the content continued to remain, perhaps one of the most difficult things in web development (and, probably, therefore everyone prefers to avoid contacting it). <br><br>  The reason for the content began to pay more and more attention is a few reasons: <br><ul><li>  The content has become too much; </li><li>  Obviously, the quality of the material affects the level of conversion; </li><li>  Content itself has become a good selling item. </li></ul><br>  The latter confirms the experience of the newspaper New York Times, which began selling paid access to its online version from March 2011 and now expects to receive from such a subscription to a number of its publications up to $ 91 million a year.  (" <a href="http://go.bloomberg.com/tech-blog/2012-12-20-the-new-york-times-paywall-is-working-better-than-anyone-had-guessed/">The New York Times Paywall Is Working Better Than Anyone Had Guessed</a> ").  A good attempt to sell access is in the newspaper Vedomosti. <br><br>  And perhaps the most significant idea that will focus on content is the lack of content strategies now.  Econsultancy published in November a survey of 1,300 marketers, according to which, only 38% of companies have content marketing strategies, while 90% of respondents believe that the importance of this area is growing (‚Äú <a href="http://econsultancy.com/us/blog/11126-the-state-of-content-marketing-in-the-uk-infographic">The state of content marketing in the UK</a> ‚Äù). <br><br>  In this place, it would be necessary to write some conclusions, but I have nothing to write.  Understanding the importance of content, I constantly encounter in my work that this is the most vulnerable and undervalued area of ‚Äã‚Äãdevelopment.  The only thing I believe is that the demand in the field of professional content creation, content management, content analysis and interaction with it will grow more dynamically than with its design or delivery systems. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/165921/">https://habr.com/ru/post/165921/</a></p>
