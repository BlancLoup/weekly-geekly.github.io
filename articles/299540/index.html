Or Yandex.Store status</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Probably, many puzzled brows - what is it, Yandex.Store?  And for good reason.  Around this service was a huge amount of hype, and then everything suddenly stopped and subsided.  Why?  Let's try to figure it out. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For those who do not remember what kind of service.  Brazenly copy the description from Wikipedia: <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Spoiler</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  ‚ÄúYandex.Store‚Äù (also Yandex.Store; pronounced ‚ÄúYandex Store‚Äù) is an application store for devices on the Android platform, opened by the Russian Internet company Yandex.  The store was launched on February 25, 2013. <br>  <b>Special features</b> <br>  The store is an alternative to Google Play - the official program store for Android, which is operated by Google.  Using the Yandex.Store service, users can download and install free and paid applications on their device. <br>  As of the beginning of 2014, over 100,000 applications are available in Yandex.Store. <br>  Payment is made from bank cards, from mobile phone accounts (Beeline, MTS, MegaFon), bonuses (given for the purchase of paid games and applications) and using the Yandex.Money service. <br>  All applications from Yandex.Store are scanned by Kaspersky Lab antivirus.  The store uses Yandex search technologies: for example, when searching for programs, the synonyms of the query are taken into account and are being translated into other languages. <br>  Currently, the service interface is available in Russian, English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Turkish and Ukrainian. <br>  ‚ÄúYandex.Store‚Äù is preinstalled in OPPO, PocketBook, Explay, teXet, Huawei, WEXLER, 3Q, Qumo devices, as well as in the Nokia X / XL / X2 DS line.  On the basis of Yandex.Store, you can also create local versions of the store - with your storefront and under your own brand. <br></div></div><br>  From myself I would add that for some reason Yandex.Store does not have any web interface.  That is, you can view and install applications only from Yandex.Store on your device.  Moreover, there is no opportunity to send a link to the application, on which it would be possible to view and install it.  A strange decision, but write it down to the developer paradigm. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">At the moment the service looks pretty decent, like this.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a46/44d/ccc/a4644dccc96248a399d8cec74d0cb6fc.jpg"><br></div></div><br>  I myself probably would not have remembered this service either, if the blocking of my application and the terrible support from Google Play did not force me to look for alternatives.  I found an alternative in the form of Yandex.Store, published there, and only then the worm of doubt began to gnaw at my soul.  It is useful to check.  So let's first find out if this service is alive at all. <br><br><h2>  Yes alive </h2><br><ol><li>  Service is available; </li><li>  You can publish your applications; </li><li>  You can install applications from there; </li><li>  The latest release of the application Yandex.Store from December 8, 2015. </li></ol>

    <h2>  No, dead </h2><br><ol><li>  The latest update on the official twitter is from June 3, 2014; </li><li>  There are no reviews of support in the official VKontakte group; </li><li>  Yandex support does not even answer questions on incorrect debiting as a result of the service‚Äôs operation; </li><li>  Judging by user feedback, Yandex.Store has many adware applications.  I did not check, but I see no reason not to believe - given the lack of moderation; </li><li>  The latest news about Yandex.Store dates back to the end of 2014 at best.  There are more recent ones - but only with the output of smartphones with Yandex.Store preinstalled - the flywheel was launched a long time ago, and everything was rolling for some time by inertia; </li><li>  There is one more forgotten project, yandex, closely related to Yandex.Store - Yandex.Kit.  Its Android firmware for smartphones from Yandex.  The site works, there are no updates and no news, Wikipedia claims that there were rumors about the dissolution of the team in May 2015.  Although representatives of Yandex officially deny the closure of the project.  Well, time has shown the truth. </li></ol><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A little more about Yandex.Kit</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Yandex has closed the Yandex.Kit project, an operating system for smartphones and tablets developed on the basis of the open source Android code.  The former member of the Yandex.Kit development team reported on the closure of the project Rusbase.  The information was confirmed by an employee of the partner company. <br><br>  According to the same source, the ‚ÄúKita‚Äù development team is disbanded, and its members are scattered around other projects.  In addition, some of the developers of ‚ÄúKita‚Äù left the company.  In April of this year, the team that worked on the design of Yandex.Kit posted on the Facebook page an entry ‚ÄúGoodbye Yandex‚Äù. <br><br>  The basis of the team that worked on the project was the employees of the St. Petersburg company SPB Software acquired by Yandex in 2011.  The studio specialized in complex software products for mobile platforms, including the alternative SPB Shell for Android. <br><br>  Representatives of Yandex deny the closure of the project: <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe launched Yandex.Kit on February 19, 2014.  Last year, we agreed to pre-install Yandex.Kita on Explay, Huawei, Smarto, DEXP devices, the Yandex press service reported. Now this product is not actively developed, including due to opposition from Google.  As far as we know, some Smarto and DEXP tablets are currently on sale on Yandex.Kite. ‚Äù <br><br></div></div><br><h2>  findings </h2><br>  The project does not develop and is frozen, although new versions of the application are periodically posted - apparently, they care about compatibility.  It is extremely ugly on the part of Yandex to leave such a ‚Äúzombie‚Äù in limbo and to pretend that everything is in order.  Google at least honestly closed their unsuccessful projects. <br><br>  On the other hand - apparently, the freezing is due to the fact that Google is not a good corporation, as many people used to think.  You can, for example, recall the news that at some point Explay refused to install Yandex.Store on their devices.  I do not want to breed conspiracy theories and Kiselevschiny, but still.  "Coincidence?  I don‚Äôt think so! ‚ÄùApparently, Google pressed vendors and forbade them to work with such competitive Yandex applications as their own firmware and application store.  A comment from Yandex representatives on the fact that the development of the project is frozen, in particular, due to the opposition from Google confirms this.  We know that similar wars are going on between Microsoft, Google, Apple and even Oracle.  Apparently, Yandex is also tied up in this - for almost two years now. <br><br>  What's next?  And we, apparently, will see this as a result of the proceedings between Google and Yandex with the help of FAS.  So who knows.  Perhaps the day is not so far when Yandex services will return to smartphones in Russia.  Well, or there is a pessimistic option - that Yandex is just waiting for the next pack of sanctions to arrive, and Google Play will be unavailable for the whole of Russia, and not just the Crimea, and then most users will in any case switch to their native domestic developer. <br><br>  There is, however, another option - vague rumors about a similar product of Yandex - Erica. <br><blockquote>  Now in Yandex, a new project is being developed called Erica, which provides for a deeper modification of Android.  For the development of Erica, Tigran Khudaverdian, Head of Mobile and Software Products, is responsible </blockquote><br>  But he is unlikely to be spared from the problems that Yandex.Store and Yandex.Kit have had - so most likely this project will share their difficult fate. <br><br>  Comments from company representatives are welcome. <br><br><h2>  Links </h2><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AF%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581.Store">Wikipedia</a> about Yandex.Store; </li><li>  Yandex.Store <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/nevosoft/blog/153045/">review</a> from October 2012; </li><li>  Yandex.Kit <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/yandex/blog/213103/">review</a> from the Yandex blog; </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/279553/">Is there life without google play?</a>  Alternatives and application updates; </li><li>  Official <a href="https://twitter.com/Yandex_Store">Twitter</a> Yandex.Store; </li><li>  The official group <a href="https://vk.com/yandex.store">vkontakte</a> Yandex.Store; </li><li>  <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D435607%26st%3D440">Problems</a> with refund and lack of support; </li><li>  <a href="http://rusbase.com/news/kit-utonul/">"Kit drowned"</a> - the original article about the closure of the project Yandex.Kit; </li><li>  <a href="http://app2top.ru/industry/explay-bol-she-ne-predustanavlivaet-yandex-store-na-sv-48262.html">Disclaimer</a> Explay from Yandex.Store preset; </li><li>  The <a href="https://lenta.ru/news/2016/02/05/yandexfas/">trial</a> between Google and Yandex; </li><li>  <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/ins/business/30/03/2015/5517f3439a7947d72378d826">About contracts</a> signed by smartphone makers with Google. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299540/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299540/</a></p>
