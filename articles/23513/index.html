  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The evolution of blogging. part I</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <strong>The development of blogging.</strong> <br>  Blog, diary, blogosphere - these words have already become the norm for any person at least a little familiar with the Internet. <br>  Why not?  After all, this is a great way to convey information to the public, to learn about current events on any subject first-hand, and many would not mind telling about their difficult fate.  Now blogs are not only mere mortal Internet users, but also politicians, musicians and leaders of large companies.  But even blogging does not stand still, changing every day, it will take on different forms, and about what exactly, I want to tell you. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>Where did the sparrow eat or trogging.</strong> <br>  Tumblog or Tlog is, if you can put it that way, a blog draft.  In the blog author adds posts under several headings: <br>  ‚Ä¢ quote <br>  If the author of the tloga liked someone‚Äôs expression, or he simply found it important and significant for himself, then he simply copies it to himself in a trog with a link to the author of the quote naturally. <br>  ‚Ä¢ log <br>  In principle, this is the same quote with only distinguished by the number of authors; logs from various IM networks (ICQ, Gmail, Jabber and others) are added to this category. <br>  As well as video, audio, photos, etc. <br>  Some people equate a blog with a tag, but this is not entirely correct.  According to the standard, there are no comments in the blogs, and the archive is not much needed, in general, the blog is a collection of interesting content for the author and his readers today and maybe tomorrow. <br>  The tumblr site is considered to be the originator of the blogging, but competitors have appeared with popularity that also deserve attention - for example, the <a href="http://mmm-tasty.ru/">mmm-tasty</a> Russian-language service and foreign <a href="http://streem.us/">streem</a> , the latter refuses to give rss, by the way, which in my opinion is a great folly.  However, no one forces you to go and register on one of these services, since in addition to them there are also separate engines created specifically for those who want to be sure of their information security, or to be sure of their tlog'a 100% efficiency - ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://ozimodo.rubyforge.org/">Ozimodo</a> - written in Ruby, using the Ruby on Rails MVC framework, unfortunately it is not installed by all providers, so check it before installation - it is possible that your provider does not have one either. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://nanograbbr.com/ru">Nanograbbr</a> - the first Russian tlog engine.  Written in PHP, for data storage uses MySQL, in principle, you install this engine on any hosting company, and the fact that our swami developers are compatriots is also a big plus. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://gelatocms.com/">Gelato</a> - Foreign blogging engine as well as Nanograbbr uses PHP and MySQL. The only significant difference is the number of ready-made themes. <br>  And Wordpress fans will like the special <a href="http://wordpress.com/blog/2008/01/28/introducing-prologue/">Prologue</a> theme sharpened under the blogging. <br>  In general, deciding to start a blog you will not have a question where to go - the creators of <a href="http://mmm-tasty.ru/">mmm-tasty</a> and <a href="http://nanograbbr.com/ru">Nanograbbr</a> have been waiting for you for a long time). <br>  <strong>What are you doing now or microblogging.</strong> <br>  In this category, I decided to include Microblogs, link blogs and live streaming services.  In essence, these 3 concepts are very similar, but for starters about each separately. <br>  Microblog is a blog in which the author leaves short notes, usually no more than 200 characters, for example ‚ÄúDrinking beer‚Äù or ‚ÄúGoing on a bus‚Äù, in general, any information about what he is doing at the moment, the author‚Äôs passing thoughts or is an expression like microblog author.  For the most part, the microblog serves as an addition to the main blog, for the most dedicated readers, because it allows him to take a deeper look into the life of the author.  The most popular microblogging service is <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter, which</a> opened its pages in July 2006, has earned the trust of users and has acquired all sorts of clients for posting and additions.  Just like with the tlog services, <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> has competitors: <br>  This is a Russian-language <a href="http://smspr.ru/">smspr.ru</a> , and a foreign <a href="http://jaiku.com/">jaiku.com</a> (by the way, jaiku is more like a live stream service than a twitter counterpart, but we'll talk more about that) By the way, another Russian developers went even further and created the <a href="http://www.oneword.ru/">oneword.ru</a> service - its distinctive feature is that the post is just one (!!!) word.  And even social networks do not disdain microblogging - <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">facebook.com</a> , <a href="http://wow.ya.ru/">I.ru</a> support status change, and in <a href="http://www.liveinternet.ru/">liveinternet.ru</a> they decided not to suffer, calling the microblog Events. <br>  Linkblog and Lifestream (Lifestream) services - Most often in such a linkblog you will see only links and perhaps a brief description of them. <br>  What is it for? <br>  The Internet is constantly evolving and new startups appear faster than mushrooms after the rain, and it‚Äôs almost impossible to keep track of one author everywhere ‚Äî services like <a href="http://jaiku.com/">jaiku.com</a> come to his aid.  He carefully collects all the information you left on the Internet most often through RSS in one thread.  That is - you post a photo on <a href="http://flickr.com/">flickr.com</a> or another photo hosting site and a link to this photo appears on your link blog, <br>  add a bookmark to <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> or another bookmark storage service and again the same thing, it will also happen to your post in the microblog and your <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">youtube.com</a> video, any information you left on another service will get into your link blog, the only thing needed is an RSS feed. <br>  The result is that all your content is collected in one stream accessible to any user.  Now your reader does not need to subscribe to your bookmarks, videos, etc., he doesn‚Äôt even need to register on all these services, because there is one big stream that has it all at once.  Just such a live stream blog appears as a magazine - you will always find the necessary link that the live stream service will keep for you.  And some people simply use such services only because they have no time to run a great blog. <br>  What are the services involved in such a gathering? <br>  This already mentioned <a href="http://jaiku.com/">jaiku.com</a> , unlike <a href="http://friendfeed.com/">friendfeed,</a> allows you to add any RSS feed, <a href="http://friendfeed.com/">friendfeed.com</a> - convenient and beautiful of interesting features - an opportunity to mark any post you like.  <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">tumblr</a> - may also be your life-stream assistant, but there are not so many services from which it imports information.  There is also <a href="http://socialthing.com/">socialthing.com</a> <a href="http://www.mybloglog.com/">mybloglog.com</a> and others, here everyone will find something of their own.  Speaking of which, besides, for wordpress lovers there are special plug-ins <a href="http://elliottback.com/wp/archives/2006/12/14/lifestream-wp-plugin-for-wordpress/">WP Lifestream</a> and <a href="http://rick.jinlabs.com/code/rss-stream/">RSS Stream</a> . <br>  Lifestream services help an ordinary reader and author to stay connected anytime, anywhere, now after leaving one site you will not lose friends and acquaintances. <br>  As we see, blogging does not stand still, it grows and changes every day along with its authors and readers.  Someone chooses a short and accessible Tlog, someone, due to circumstances, chooses a microblogging or even travels the world wide web without one and the other, and the live stream service collects all the places where this person left his mark, others use everything at once.  One thing is clear - there are no indifferent ones, here everyone will find something for the soul.  By the way, microblogging and blogging is only one side of the coin, in the next part we will talk with you about photoblogging, podcasting and blogging ... <br><br>  via <a href="http://ad28.ru/%3Fcat%3D11">AD28.ru</a> <br></div>
