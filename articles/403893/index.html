Read the answers to these and other questions in the article. <br><blockquote>  <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-4181.html">DSPeaker Anti-Mode: how to improve the sound of acoustics using digital correction</a> </blockquote>  The magazine ‚ÄúStereo &amp; Video‚Äù examines the principle of operation of the device and finds out how it makes the sound reliable, to whom such a device will fit and with which components of the audio system it can be used.  And also in detail about how to produce calibration and adjustment of the corrector. <br><blockquote>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/blog/283862/">How to prepare a room for listening to music</a> </blockquote>  In our blog on GT, we talked about sound improvement techniques and talked about using the DSPeaker acoustic corrector not only in the home space, but also during exhibitions.  Plus, why do we need a certain area to listen to music. <br><br><h3>  Atoll Electronique - Players, Amplifiers, Phono Proofers and D / A Converters </h3><br>  The <a href="http://www.atoll-audio.ru/">Atoll Electronique</a> brand was founded in 1997 in France and began with the production of stereo amplifiers.  Over time, the product line has been expanded to meet the needs of good sound lovers around the world, but the balance of price and quality has remained unchanged.  And in 2007-2008, the second generation of devices appeared.  Today, high end products are sold throughout America, Europe and Asia, and we are pleased to be the official distributor of Atoll in Russia. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/5cc/5e6/7fa/5cc5e67fa7e54869a5b928a5e13e1d4d.jpg" width="400"></div><br>  <i>/ <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/fonokorrektor/atoll/atoll_p_200se.html">Phono stage Atoll P200SE</a></i> <br><br><blockquote>  <a href="http://www.atoll-audio.ru/articles/3923">Sterile Hi-Fi from the French Atoll Electronique: when done correctly</a> </blockquote>  Everything you need to know about the history of Atoll, its founders, competitors, ways of development and production.

We would like to introduce you to some of the brands represented there. <br><br>  We used some for the equipment of cinema halls, and from others we collected whole acoustic systems that could be immediately evaluated. <br><br><h3>  Ceratec - floor, shelf, wall and built-in acoustics, loudspeakers and subwoofers </h3><br>  We used this brand to equip one of our demonstration cinema halls.  German <a href="http://www.ceratec.ru/">acoustics</a> combines high-quality sound and an interesting design that fits into the interior in the style of Hi-Tech thanks to the materials used: glass, aluminum and chrome. <br><br>  The brand has long been the market leader in home theater acoustics.  In addition, noteworthy and built-in appliances, which can be placed under the wallpaper and a layer of plaster. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7be/268/776/7be2687760ae4af497b5203475816f95.jpg" width="400"></div><br>  <i>Built-in acoustics <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/vstraivaemaya_akustika/ceratec/ceratec_cerasonar_1520_x1.html">Ceratec Cerasonar 1520 X1</a></i> <br><br><blockquote>  <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-3903.html">Built-in acoustics Ceratec Cerasonar: and the walls will sing</a> </blockquote>  From the article you will learn what to consider when installing built-in acoustics, how the choice of acoustics is influenced by the size of the room, which systems can be embedded not only in the walls, but also in glass and ceramic surfaces.

In this article we will talk about how this acoustics was first presented at the exhibition in Amsterdam, and in the next block we will tell you more about the brand itself. <br><br><h3>  ICE - Home Cinema Speakers </h3><br>  As we have already noted, this <a href="http://ice-cinema.com/">brand is</a> completely new: it was first introduced in 2017.  ICE speakers were developed by engineers at World Audio Distribution and the Laboratory of Yuri Fomin (F-Lab).  They are produced at a factory in Riga (Latvia).  In production, only high-quality components are used, and to achieve high-quality sound systems are drawn up in a ‚Äúclosed box‚Äù. <br><br>  Also, great attention was paid to the ease of installation of the systems: the cases have a shallow depth, VESA200 mounted attachments, terminals in front and behind, as well as special cable channels in the back.  Another feature of acoustics is the body material.  Finnish plywood or MDF has a special soft-touch coating so that there is no glare from the screen on the speakers. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e65/dcf/9ac/e65dcf9ac7404265afee97f79c32bd53.jpg" width="400"></div><br>  <i>Wall speakers <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/nastennaya_akustika/ice/ice_s6-1.html">ICE S6.1</a></i> <br><br><blockquote>  <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5011.html">Acoustics test for home cinema ICE S8.1, S8.2, 12.1P, 15.2P</a> </blockquote>  The article tells about acoustics, which is installed in our new showroom.

The founder of the brand Sami Penttila (Sami Penttil√§) wanted each client to acquire, in addition to high-quality sound, together with acoustic systems, a part of a northern country. <br><br>  Therefore, for the manufacture of the case, the tradition of northern joiners is combined with the most modern wood processing methods.  Veneered housings are assembled by hand and make the appearance of acoustics so recognizable. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7bb/c73/86c/7bbc7386cfff4fff9dfa5255041f5c13.jpg" width="400"></div><br>  <i>Bookshelf acoustics <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/polochnaya_akustika/penaudio/penaudio_rebel.html">Penaudio Rebel</a></i> <br><br><blockquote>  <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-2742.html">Bookshelf acoustics Penaudio Cenya</a> </blockquote>  The review describes in detail the components used in the speaker system, and the sensations of listening to music of different genres.
