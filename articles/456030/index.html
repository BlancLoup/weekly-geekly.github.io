I am <a href="https://www.facebook.com/siba.piranha">Vanya Solovyov</a> , design director at <em>DocDoc</em> (part of the Sberbank group).  Today heading Tim-tim, in which I will tell you how we get along with other teams. </p><br><p>  In 2017, our interfaces were created in <em>Sketch</em> , prototypes were assembled in <em>Marvel</em> , and transferred to development via <em>Zeplin</em> .  Everything was standard for the time until <em>Figma</em> appeared. </p><br><p>  This article is not about comparing tools, such articles are already written in abundance.  It is about how in our company <em>Figma</em> helped: </p><br><ul><li>  design to become public, and not the privilege of one designer; </li><li>  organize the whole process of working on a design without unnecessary documentation; </li><li>  get rid of unnecessary tools and resources to support them. </li></ul><br><h2 id="dlya-dizaynera">  For the designer </h2><br><p>  The designer no longer stores layouts locally, in the form of files.  Does not exchange screenshots of interfaces with the manager and does not forward the necessary layouts to other designers.  The layout has a link and it is available to all participants in the process. </p><br><blockquote>  Created a layout ‚Üí assembled an interactive prototype ‚Üí transferred to the development - and all this for one link. </blockquote><p><a name="habracut"></a>  The process of creating a design has ceased to be ‚Äúbehind the seal‚Äù, it became public.  The usual case in our work: the designer creates an interface, another task participant enters into the layout and leaves his advice in the form of a comment. <cut></cut></p><br><blockquote>  In <em>Figma,</em> it is convenient not only to maintain your layouts, use a common design system, but also interact with developers, testers and managers.  When the product team saws a feature, it is very important not to produce unnecessary versions and state of the layouts in order not to slow down the whole team.  <strong>Andrei Goranov, designer.</strong> </blockquote><br><h2 id="dlya-menedzhera">  For manager </h2><br><p>  We have seven product managers and each one is a leader in their own direction.  For their convenience, we organized the files in such a way that everyone has their own project in <em>Figma</em> : appointment to the doctor, diagnosis, telemedicine, etc.  One link is enough for them to ensure that all developments in their tasks were at hand. </p><br><p><img src="https://leonardo.osnova.io/431a70e6-b17c-4a41-3c1d-c2c3325a6b2a/-/scale_crop/1300x611/center/" alt="image"><br>  <em>Telemedicine Project Example</em> </p><br><p>  Improvements they bring in the form of comments to the desired part of the layout.  We jointly decided that we would not accept major changes anywhere: neither in protocols, nor in <em>Jira</em> , nor in messengers.  The necessary designer is mentioned in the comments and a notification comes to him by mail. </p><br><blockquote>  Everything is stored online, no need to shake that you will not get access to the layout, working from another computer.  I know for sure that improvements can be put only in the form of a comment in the layout and they will be made.  It is very cool.  In addition, the comment history allows you to restore events.  <strong>Grisha Garshin, manager</strong> </blockquote><br><h2 id="dlya-razrabotchika-i-testirovschika">  For developer and tester </h2><br><p>  Previously, when we passed layouts to developers through <em>Zeplin</em> , they had different ideas about layouts with designers.  Designers saw a complete picture of transitions in <em>Sketch</em> , and developers only a specific screen in <em>Zeplin</em> .  The guys did not always understand which screen they should follow and spent time on questioning. </p><br><p><img src="https://leonardo.osnova.io/a335cc67-6243-c9a8-d9eb-830a6ba07989/-/scale_crop/1300x611/center/" alt="image"><br>  <em>Developers have only seen a specific layout in Zeplin.</em> </p><br><p>  In <em>Figma,</em> developers see the same picture as the designers.  For unity, we adhere to such an organization of layouts: horizontally transitions between screens, vertically - inside screens.  This helped the guys to feel at home. </p><br><p><img src="https://leonardo.osnova.io/05e801e9-c87d-5509-a218-55a626d9af6c/-/scale_crop/1300x611/center/" alt="image"><br>  <em>Horizontally transitions between screens, vertically - inside screens</em> </p><br><blockquote>  Conveniently, all the layouts in one place and access from everyone, comfortable to do a review - there are comments.  Layouts are always relevant and in the same form for all participants, it is convenient that separate layouts for <em>iOS</em> and <em>Android</em> .  Another cool thing is that you can make a link to a specific screen, and paste it into the documentation.  <strong>Irina Mukhina, tester.</strong> </blockquote><p>  We use the same variable names in colors and styles, it helps not to produce unnecessary entities when coding the interface.  Developers can independently unload themselves any element in the layout, without wasting time asking the designer to do so.  For example, you can get the <em>svg-</em> code of the icon or export it in the desired format. </p><br><blockquote>  When you get used to online services, like <em>Figma</em> , the previous tools seem to be something primitive and very distant.  No file sharing, license issues, software installation, instead - just a link in the task description in <em>Jira</em> .  To get the <em>CSS</em> style element is enough to make two clicks.  <strong>Peter Dorozhkin, developer.</strong> </blockquote><br><h2 id="dlya-marketologa">  For marketer </h2><br><p>  We also do marketing tasks on the web in <em>Figma</em> .  They have their own project, where all the layouts are stored.  So it‚Äôs easier for marketing designers to stick to our corporate identity - all elements are in <em>Figma</em> . </p><br><p><img src="https://leonardo.osnova.io/fb021671-c6d9-1a01-f294-dde11dcc9934/-/scale_crop/1300x611/center/" alt="image"><br>  <em>Find the action that was done in the fall of 2018?</em>  <em>Pf, easy!</em> </p><br><p>  It works well and vice versa: the marketing designer drew illustrations, transferred them to <em>Figma</em> .  The product designer took them to his interface and, if necessary, slightly adjusted the shape and color - after all, everything is vector. </p><br><p><img src="https://leonardo.osnova.io/836fb929-0593-15e8-c1ba-e7658a3a681b/-/scale_crop/1300x611/center/" alt="image"><br>  <em>We are currently working on the illustration designer in Figma.</em> </p><br><blockquote>  It is easy to explain to the designer where and what visual elements you need to change / remove / add.  Instead of a thousand words, you can once show where and what to do.  These comments can be returned by designers at a convenient time for them.  <strong>Katya Fedyunina, marketer</strong> </blockquote><p>  And when the task is marketing, but directly concerns the product, the teamwork of designers from the two departments reaches a new level.  One comes up with a visual concept, another tries it on the interface - all in one layout and at the same time! </p><br><h2 id="glavnaya-mysl">  the main idea </h2><br><p>  Design - the result of the team, not one person.  Strive to ensure that each participant can interact with him comfortably.  Get away from local tools and look for those that unite you and your processes. </p></div>
