  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Making mistakes</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On the coals stood a frying pan.  The boy asked the teacher: <br>  - Can I take her? <br>  - You can, but it is hot.  - replied the teacher. <br>  The boy grabbed the pan, but at the same moment threw it aside and ran to the river with a cry to put his burned hand into the water. <br>  Returning back, he asked: <br>  - Teacher, why did not you say that a hot frying pan can burn you painfully? <br>  ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs better to burn yourself once and remember it for the rest of your life than to hear a hundred times that it hurts and forget about it as many times,‚Äù answered the teacher. <br><br>  Under habrakat I will tell that errors should be able to be done too. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The parable I quoted above was my life companion in the family where I was raised and in the university where I was taught.  In general, I was lucky. <br>  And I think that one of the most important skills of a person is the ability to make mistakes.  But, despite the fact that we all make mistakes, not all of us are able to make them (pun, aha?). <br>  The most important thing to understand is that there is nothing wrong with an error (unless of course you are an operator at a nuclear power plant). <br><br>  Consider the simplest example.  Vasya and Petya go to buy their player for the first time in their lives.  Both do not check the player when they buy it, but take it ‚Äúwithout looking‚Äù.  Well, as usual in such cases, the players of both are defective. <br>  After that, Vasya will never go behind the player himself, but will call a wiser friend.  Petya will take into account this experience and the next time before giving the money, he will check how this player works. <br>  Of course, there is a chance that Vasya was persuaded to go to the store again and explained that the player should be checked.  They will again go to the store behind the player and begin to check it.  This time none of them checked the function of the radio, but it was defective for this batch of players (a simple Chinese collector forgot to solder the necessary chip). <br>  Now Vasya will definitely never go to the store in order not to make this mistake, but Petya will take this experience into consideration and check the player thoroughly the next time (and not only the player, now he will check everything when buying).

      Despite the fact that the example is rather exaggerated, such people are found everywhere.  And from such people very bad workers turn out.  Because these workers are hopeless.  And where to take the initiative from a person who does not know how to make mistakes? <br>  The reasons for this behavior can be many, but one should be highlighted. <br>  Looking at comrades whom I know personally, it can be concluded that the reason is as follows: they were not allowed to make mistakes in childhood.  And if they did, they scolded me for mistakes. <br>  And if not scolded, then in every possible way spread rot.  In general, for life they made it clear that making mistakes is very bad!  As a result, these people are now afraid to make a mistake, because they have an attitude from their childhood. <br>  Of course, in positions where the initiative is completely unnecessary, these people become irreplaceable cadres, but when they become leaders or occupy a position that requires decision-making (and preferably quickly), then there comes ... <br><br>  Then comes the full ahtung!  Because managers who cannot make a decision are a brake on the whole business.  Sometimes it takes months to make decisions on controversial issues!  They are very good at managing the firm (department, etc.) on the regulated issues, but everything else ... And at the same time, they believe that others should not make mistakes either.  In my memory it came to the point that people were fired for the slightest mistake, recognizing them unfit for work !!! <br><br>  But worse is for ordinary company employees.  Here he was mistaken in something and now he is awaiting punishment from his superiors.  He will never offer anything new, because it may be the wrong decision.  He terrorizes himself with thoughts that each next step may be his last in this office.  And so on until a nervous breakdown. <br><br>  By and large, if there is a chief-subordinate in the chain at least one link with an ‚Äúerroneous‚Äù complex, then it is possible to put an end to the successful work of the entire chain. <br><br>  Morality: look at yourself from the outside and try to choose a job according to your attitude towards mistakes.  But even better, if you realize that there is nothing wrong with mistakes.  They just need to be considered.  Do not reproach yourself for every puncture, but say that the next time you will succeed as it should! <br><br>  PS Run away from leaders who do not know how to make mistakes.  This is a loop.  Believe me! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/63148/">https://habr.com/ru/post/63148/</a></p>
