  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Road to the clouds: SaaS vs desktop</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the end of 2012, a small <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/163291/">survey</a> flashed on Habr√© ‚ÄúWhy do you not use cloud infrastructure / services in your company?‚Äù His results are very indicative of the Russian SaaS market as a whole: most respondents consider cloud services to be either expensive or not safe for storing commercial information.  Nevertheless, the number of players in the cloud services market is growing, and even now such ‚Äúconservative‚Äù and, at first glance, desktop services like 1C are being offered as a service. <br><br><h5>  Terminology difficulties </h5><br>  Despite the existing prejudices and fear of users, cloud services are increasing their market share, are actively developing, and day after day they offer private clients and businesses new solutions and services: creating and storing notes, full-fledged documents, storing links, organizing corporate portals, real CRM in cloud, etc ... <br>  Before trying to answer the question, what is the reason for the growing success, let's look at the concepts of "cloud" and "SaaS".  Today in Russia, cloud services are subject to two main trends: <br><ol><li>  incomplete understanding of the very essence of cloud services </li><li>  numerous myths about cost, danger, instability of services. </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/05a/9e4/f59/05a9e4f59442d55e3c6870f991476aa3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Image source: <a href="http://www.computerra.ru/">www.computerra.ru</a></i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's start with the first item.  Often, users by the term SaaS and the "cloud" understand the cloud virtual PBX, implemented through IP-telephony.  However, this understanding significantly limits the functionality and cuts the essence of the concept itself.  In fact, cloud technology is both Yandex or Google e-mail, and popular file storages, and Google Docs. <br><br>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saas">Wikipedia</a> gives a rather convoluted explanation that there is SaaS, which is understandable mainly to technical specialists.  Meanwhile, the decision to implement cloud infrastructure is often made by commercial experts.  It is for them that I want to explain from the point of view of the manager‚Äôs conceptual apparatus.  In principle, the entire essence of the cloud (SaaS) lies in the name itself - software as a service - software as a service.  That is, a person does not receive a program installed on his computer, but some service, which for him is a utility for work / study / other purposes and at the same time ‚Äúlives‚Äù in the browser, that is, is virtual.  Such software does not need its own server, it does not require any special configurations of hardware and the operating system.  The user opens the browser, enters the application, logs in and works.

      The choice of solutions for working in the clouds, indeed, is worthy and presented by a number of eminent companies.  By the spring of 2013, there were several major players on the market offering corporate cloud solutions.  Let's try to figure out who is who and what developers are ready to offer to business. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b02/499/0e8/b024990e82538d95025308e4d139da98.png"><br><br><h5>  Clouds in faces: comfortable and simple. </h5><br>  First of all, as a whole class of tools working in the cloud, you can select small online applications that allow you to save user data on an external server (for a user, on a virtual disk).  Of the most interesting, for example: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://mytaskhelper.ru/"><b>My Task Helper</b></a> - a set of ready-made templates for orders, invitations, polls and even for a bugtracker </li><li>  <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/ru-ru/onenote/"><b>Microsoft's One Note</b></a> is a handy notepad that allows you to post notes on a large-scale Share Point or Sky Drive </li><li>  many online applications, such as Crocodoc (viewing and commenting documents, disk space), Asana (task setting and task management system), Moovia (project collaboration tool). </li></ul>  Most of the above applications are implemented in foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãand are not widely used in Russia.  However, the situation changes completely when it comes to larger players supplying the market with full-featured and often expensive solutions.  Such offers are good for any business - from a few people to a large company, when you have to work with clients and you need to implement intra-company communication. <br><br><h5>  Clouds in faces: strong and functional, but alien </h5><br>  Today in Russia there are several powerful applications in the cloud solutions market for managing projects and documents that allow you to manage processes and even document flow.  Conventionally, they can be divided into two large groups.  The first is the well-known western services, some of which do not even have full Russian localization: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://basecamp.com/"><b>Basecamp</b></a> , the company's 37 Signals product, is a popular SaaS system.  It allows you to manage files and differentiate access rights, hold discussions and discussions in blogs, includes calendars and CRM, gives you the opportunity to set tasks and deadlines for these tasks.  There is no built-in document editor.  Basecamp can integrate with Google Drive, Dropbox, Evernote and some other services. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.zoho.com/"><b>Zoho</b></a> is another popular cloud solution, unlike the previous ones, which has a built-in editor for documents, spreadsheets and presentations.  Zoho offers users the widest functionality: collaboration, project and task management, instant messaging, in-house communications, file storage.  Zoho products integrate with Google Apps and Microsoft Projects. </li><li>  <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/ru-ru/"><b>MS Office 365</b></a> .  The name speaks for itself - first of all, the ability to create and jointly edit documents in the cloud directly from the browser, save the prepared files and assign access rights.  In addition, Office 365 offers the ability to create a corporate website, e-mail, calendars, video conferencing of user groups.  Project management as such is not implemented, the ability to integrate with other services is missing. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/ru/enterprise/apps/business/"><b>Google Apps</b></a> is a complex web application for business from Google.  These are e-mail, the ability to create a corporate portal using ready-made templates, a calendar with the task creation function, Google Drive, and archiving of documents.  Google Apps implemented Google Docs - already familiar to many online editor of documents, spreadsheets and presentations. </li></ul><br><h5>  Clouds in faces: strong, functional and their </h5><br>  However, not only foreign developers are ready to offer SaaS solutions.  In Russia, there has recently been an active growth of cloud services, and this has made it possible for obvious leaders to stand out in the market, some of whom have successfully begun expansion into Western Europe and the USA, creating a viable and relevant product for any market: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.megaplan.ru/"><b>Megaplan</b></a> .  Application with rich functionality: maintaining a database of employees, monitoring the work of employees and evaluating the efficiency of labor, CRM, project management, collaboration, file storage system, operational accounting.  There is no built-in document editor.  Integration with other services (1C, client-bank), Google calendar, social networks, online store, with the site via API. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.bitrix24.ru/"><b>Bitrix 24</b></a> .  Announces the creation of a single working space within the company, which he successfully copes with: tasks, calendar, tape, files, instant messages, alerts.  It is a worthy corporate portal.  Clients may well be satisfied with the proposed operational CRM and the system for managing tasks and projects with reports and a Gantt chart. </li></ul>  It is worthwhile to stop here and say that ‚ÄúMegaplan‚Äù and ‚ÄúBitrix‚Äù belong to 1C, hence there are several features that can lead to diametrically opposite results: <br>  1. 1C will not go to the development of "alien" CRM despite its already developed, so, most likely, a good cloud-based CRM can not be expected; <br>  2. if there are two task managers, it is obvious that they will soon be merged into one, convenient, functional and strong.  So, perhaps, another interesting cloud solution will soon appear on the market, combining a corporate portal and a project management system. <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.amocrm.ru/"><b>amoCRM</b></a> .  The system of customer accounting and transactions with elements of task management and sales analysis.  In amoCRM it is possible to separate access rights to transactions and customers - each manager is responsible only for his part.  The system in the standard delivery is integrated with Google Apps, integration with accounting and IP-telephony is an optional service. </li><li>  <a href="http://evernote.com/intl/ru/"><b>Evernote</b></a> - notebook for records for private users and the knowledge base - for corporate.  It has a nice interface, allows you to share records in the cloud, differentiates access rights.  One business notebook (notes) is actually a form of organizing work with projects in a business group.  Such notebooks are combined into an intrafirm system of knowledge.  Evernote is interesting with the possibilities of working with handwritten and printed notes, it is an excellent tool for the manager, merchandiser, creative, photographer - those who need permanent small records. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.teamlab.com/ru/"><b>TeamLab</b></a> .  We can say that this is a universal solution that combines a set of tools most needed for a business: project management, simple and convenient CRM, collaboration with files and documents, corporate Wiki, blogs, polls.  The key advantage of TeamLab is a <a href="http://www.teamlab.com/ru/online-editor.aspx">unique online document editor</a> , implemented in HTML5 and as close as possible to desktop counterparts in functionality.  TeamLab integrates with Google Drive, Dropbox, Box, SkyDrive. </li></ul><br>  In principle, we can distinguish another group of cloud solutions - these are IP-telephony operators, who have already announced the creation of full-fledged virtual offices.  From the Russian, you can highlight <a href="http://www.mango-office.ru/"><b>Mango Office</b></a> , offering along with the cloud PBX and call center, integrated with CRM Mango Office.  CRM has the usual functionality: a tool for managing customers and sales, setting goals for managers, managing transactions. <br><br>
<h5>  Clouds are a plus for developer and client </h5><br>  <b>Customer benefits:</b> <br><ul><li>  No cost to install updates, ease of deployment.  However, hardware equipment with pre-installed software, hardware platforms is not always guaranteed; some services do not work with mobile browsers. </li><li>  speed of implementation (the period of implementation is practically absent), which is valuable for both small and large teams.  Small ones will be able to quickly deploy their activities using quality software, and large-scale ones will not lose working time on installing and configuring applications for each workplace </li><li>  utility of the application - a full-fledged multi-user solution, wide possibilities for joint work on projects and / or joint editing of documents </li><li>  Often there is software divisibility and the ability to purchase by individual modules. </li><li>  flexible payment solutions: a scale that depends on the number of users, the functionality required, the amount of virtual disk space.  This is as convenient as paying a mobile phone subscription. </li><li>  access via network channels via a web interface from virtually anywhere in the world, from various types of devices </li><li>  simple, familiar user interface - everyone is accustomed to his browser and just continues to work on it </li><li>  simple, quick and frequent update, always available latest system version </li><li>  a single software core - less resources and financial costs. </li></ul><br>  <b>Pros for the developer:</b> <br><ul><li>  easy client side deployment </li><li>  continuous service fees, reliable payment flow </li><li>  easy intervention to the market - the user can, in a few clicks, start using the free demo version and evaluate the product </li><li>  continuous product development following the web and end user terminals. </li></ul><br><h5>  Cloud economy </h5><br>  We have to admit that any modern company cannot exist without a specific set of general-purpose software and specific to the type of activity.  Licensed software is quite expensive, requires a certain level of hardware, employee (s), serving a fleet of users' computers and software installed on them, paid implementation, training, and often paid support.  Thus, the construction of an optimal software infrastructure of a company requires significant both one-time and fixed costs. <br><br>  Turning to the "cloud", the company gets obvious financial advantages: <br><ul><li>  Pre-known and stable costs for maintaining cloud infrastructure </li><li>  Savings on server maintenance, starting from the equipment itself and ending with the remuneration of specialists, whose competence is maintenance </li><li>  Saving on installation, implementation, deployment </li><li>  Flexible payment system depending on actual needs (amount of required disk space, number of users, and sometimes even a set of modules) </li><li>  "Cloud" software licenses do not need to be put on balance </li></ul><br>  However, it should be borne in mind that often when introducing cloud technologies, the client faces high price tags for customization for his business or simply the impossibility of customization.  At the same time, this problem is easily solved - the market is not monopolistic and you can always find decent alternative solutions. <br>  Each company, making a decision on the introduction of cloud software, finds its additional benefits.  But one thing remains unambiguous: when using this type of software, the ROI significantly increases - an indicator of return on business investment, which, of course, includes IT infrastructure. <br><br><h5>  Cloud critique </h5><br>  Any medal has two sides.  When it comes to news in the IT-sphere, both sides of the medal are very pronounced: the front glitters and attracts, the opposite - frightens with uncertainty and leaves many questions open.  So with SaaS - at the end of the article is to talk about the criticism of such decisions. <br><br>  Probably the most ardent critic of cloud technologies is Richard Stallman.  He talks amusingly about espionage, data insecurity, the inability to monitor all the operations of the program.  If in the case of corporate software there is a copy of a program that is difficult and illegal to change, then <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html">‚Äúin the case of service programs ... you use a copy that you don‚Äôt have‚Äù</a> .  Stallman argues that clouds are a ‚Äúdevil-may-care‚Äù approach to client computing and traditionally in conclusion offers to use free software, create an alternative to servers, etc. ... In principle, he criticizes from the point of view of his philosophy and his arguments are of little weight to the Russian small and medium-sized business, however, it will be interesting and useful for professionals to read his articles. <br><br>  So, despite the obvious advantages, cloud technologies have a number of aspects, if not negative, then significantly hindering the growth trend in popularity.  They are not as global as Stallman‚Äôs criticism, but more practically directed. <br><ul><li>  The issue of security services remains open.  On the one hand, vendors and server holders provide certain security guarantees, on the other hand, the information gets into too many ‚Äúhands,‚Äù even if not interested.  In addition, software in the clouds is dangerous because employees can easily access programs and document repositories from other terminals, including their own, which can fall into the wrong hands. </li><li>  The risk of failure of the developer from further product development.  In case the software provider considers his product unprofitable, he may refuse to support the software and after a while access to the corporate system will be quite problematic. </li></ul><br>  The following two negative points are more relevant for Russia, Belarus and Ukraine: <br><ul><li>  Hard binding of cloud software to the Internet.  The quality and speed of work, as well as access to the corporate system as a whole, depends on the speed of the Internet and the stability of the connection, which often leaves much to be desired. </li><li>  Distrust of IT-outsourcing and the general technical backwardness of enterprises where software is implemented.  Opponents of the introduction of cloud technologies can be both conservatively-tuned owners and directors of companies, as well as personnel who avoid any kind of automation and virtualization due to general technical ‚Äúlack of competence‚Äù or age. </li></ul><br><h5>  Cloud perspectives in Russia </h5><br>  According to a Gartner campaign <a href="http://softwarestrategiesblog.com/2011/09/03/enterprise-software-as-a-service-market-forecast-the-future-is-already-here-%25E2%2580%2593-its-just-not-evenly-distributed/">study</a> , global expansion of cloud technologies in the corporate software sector will continue and grow in gross volumes from $ 12 million in 2011 to $ 21 million in 2015, reaching 16.3% of CARG (average annual growth rate) annually. <br><br>  It is difficult to say that cloud technologies in Russia will blow up the market and completely replace desktop solutions.  However, they are already influencing and will have an even greater impact on the development of user applications.  This is due to the fact that a private user feels in the cloud as a host, a corporate user seeks to save;  and it‚Äôs easy for both of them to work in cloud applications.  That is why such technologies will definitely not be ignored and will develop further in the following possible directions: <br><ul><li>  Merging various applications into a single "office": editors, storage, IP-telephony, accounting, CRM.  However, it is the accounting and warehouse that will dramatically slow down cloud expansion.  It is the warehouse that is most critical from the point of view of security and fault tolerance of software, therefore, a very long time preference for trading companies with a large warehouse scale will be given to desktop solutions. </li><li>  Creation of new editors (notes, photos, etc.) and active development of existing ones - up to erasing the faces between the desktop and the cloud </li><li>  Actively increasing joint editing capabilities </li><li>  The desire to reduce the cost of implementing SaaS and the transition of the cloud economy completely to the subscriber system </li></ul><br>  Clouds will choose small and medium businesses, small groups of freelancers and serious advertising agencies.  Clouds will work, grow, generate new forms of existence of the IT infrastructure of the campaigns.  They will be competitors for the desktop, but in the near future will not take his place.  It is impossible to say that the future is beyond the clouds, but it is also difficult to imagine the future without them too. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/176079/">https://habr.com/ru/post/176079/</a></p>
