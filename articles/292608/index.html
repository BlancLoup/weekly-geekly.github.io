      As a result, understand what, where and how much - to become quite a challenge.  I would like to clarify this situation a bit and offer some options of trustworthy providers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's start with the main.  Namely - with frequently asked questions. <br><br><h3>  <b>Problem questions about virtual numbers.</b> </h3><br><br>  <b>What is a virtual number?</b> <br>  If we go by abstruse way, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580">we open Wikipedia and read</a> that "... this is a service of telephone service companies. This number does not use subscriber equipment, but allows you to remotely connect to company equipment."  Pfff, I have already boiled the brain, and you?  If in a simple way, this is the same phone number as the one that is connected to the ‚Äúhandset‚Äù on your desk.  But: <br><ul><li>  minus the cost of the master Vasya to connect it; </li><li>  minus the cost of the U-PBX (since all the glands and admins on the salary are sitting at your communications provider); </li><li>  minus the cost of paperwork to obtain rights to the number; </li><li>  plus the choice of numbers (sitting in Chelyabinsk for 20 minutes we buy the number of Moscow and do not need to go anywhere); </li></ul>  I hope this arithmetic is clearer. <br><br>  <b>What are the virtual numbers?</b> <br>  Bison remember the pop song from the 90s "Girls are different: black, white, red" (if you remember the name of the group for 30 seconds, congratulations - you are a bison. And the numbers are a little different, but not in color, but in purpose. <br><br>  There are virtual numbers for: <br><ul><li>  Calls  You accept the number of any country from the operator‚Äôs list and make calls. </li><li>  Permanent SMS.  For those who are used to receive a lot of messages and respond to them. </li><li>  Disposable SMS.  For those who like to maintain anonymity when registering on social networks and for marketing campaigns. </li><li>  Free calls (number 0 800/8 800 or also called toll-free).  It is irreplaceable if you have your call-center or customer support department. </li></ul><br>  <b>What features can a virtual number provide?</b> <br>  In addition to calling and sending SMS, the possibilities of virtual numbers can be expanded by connecting black and white lists of numbers, recording a voice greeting, etc.  A complete list of available features needs to be checked with the communications provider. <br><br>  <b>Is any virtual number suitable for call tracking?</b> <br>  Yes, unless of course you bought a number for SMS to receive calls. <br><br>  <b>What documents are needed to connect a virtual number?</b> <br>  In 80% of cases - no.  However, when purchasing virtual numbers in Europe and some US states, you may be asked for a copy of your proof of identity. <br><br>  <b>We launched an advertisement and moved to another office, will the rooms continue to work?</b> <br>  Of course.  A virtual number is like an immortal pony.  As you move, he will work, work and work.  At the same time, there will be no need to re-sign a bunch of pieces of paper, as in the case of a regular phone number, in order to issue it to another address. <br><br>  <b>I decided.</b>  <b>How do I choose the right provider?</b> <br>  In principle, any provider will suit you.  It‚Äôs impossible to evaluate its quality on the site, since  Beautiful cover does not indicate the quality of communication.  The most important thing you can do is: <br><ol><li>  Request a demo mode.  Try for some time to make several calls to the directions you need.  This service is provided either for free or for little money.  If the provider does not have it and you do not know anyone who would use it, it‚Äôs better not to deal with it. </li><li>  Clarify whether the provider works directly with local telecom operators or through intermediaries.  This affects voice quality.  If the provider has a direct contract with officials in the country where you want to buy a number, they will often tell you about it openly.  If not - cooperation is questionable.  There is another possible check: </li><li>  check the quality of communication.  If both sides of the conversation perfectly hear each other, then the provider works in 90% of cases directly with suppliers.  If the connection quality is poor, there are clicks, crackles, noise, etc.  - obviously, the service is provided through a series of intermediaries, with their traffic routers.  Such arrangements are not always legal, and you can remain without communication at any time. </li></ol><br><br>  Well, we figured out the educational program.  Now I would like to understand whose services are worthy of attention.  I offer my proven top, whose numbers were used by themselves or who was recommended by colleagues from other companies.  I want to clarify that the opinion of the author of the article is based on personal experience and it may differ from the experience of other participants.  Constructive criticism, useful links and recommendations are welcome.  Flood is not welcome. <br><br><h3>  <b>Top 7 Providers of Virtual Numbers for Call Tracking.</b> </h3><br><br>  In this list, loud names, like Skype, were deliberately not used.
