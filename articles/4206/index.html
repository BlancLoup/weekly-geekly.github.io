  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Technorati is easier and more functional.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Exactly three years ago, <a href="http://technorati.com/">Technorati</a> was officially registered, and the search site of the same name moved from the status of a scientific project to a new stage of its development.  Since then, much has changed, and the growth of the blogosphere itself has been particularly impressive.  Suffice it to say that the creators of Technorati initially expected that the number of blogs in the index would be in the thousands.  Now the index has grown by several orders of magnitude - up to 50 million blogs.  The search engine has learned to work with other content formats, including photos and videos. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The main goal of the <a href="http://technorati.com/weblog/2006/07/110.html">current changes</a> was to simplify the Technorati interface, as well as personalization.  Previously, developers received many complaints about the excessive complexity of the search site, so they tried to make it as simple and understandable as possible for novice users. <br><br>  Website design has become simpler and cleaner.  The main change is the appearance of not one, but two main pages at once.  One is for site visitors, and the second is for registered users.  A new section <a href="http://technorati.com/discover/">called Discover has</a> appeared on the page for guests, so that visitors can quickly find new interesting blogs and posts, traveling through a comprehensible list of subject categories (there are only six - the layout of a paper newspaper is taken as a sample).  Technorati site can now be read as a newspaper, because right on the portal published the most popular posts from blogs in all thematic categories. <br><br>  In addition, the list of the most popular requests, tags and posts in the blogosphere at the moment, as well as a photo gallery of "selected bloggers" who last added their blog to the thematic catalog, is constantly updated on the common front page.  Everyone can get into this gallery.

      The layout of pages with search results has changed, so now the ads on them are not so strongly striking, and at the same time it is more clearly marked.  There are new sorting options, including by language and novelty. <br><br>  Significantly improved mechanisms for counting incoming links, now every indexed blogger may notice changes in his rating: he updates faster and more accurately.  The structure of the <a href="http://technorati.com/pop/">Popular</a> section has also changed.  Now there on one single page all interesting information is presented, including the most popular search queries and tags, The Technorati Top 100 rating, lists of the most favorite users of blogs, videos, books, news and movies. <br><br>  Lists of "favorite" are calculated by the number of users who have brought this material to the list of their "favorites".  By the way, this <a href="http://technorati.com/faves">Favorites</a> feature has now also become more useful.  If you add a few blogs to your favorites, then when you visit the site, you immediately see the latest posts from these blogs right on your personal page.  In addition, it‚Äôs now easier to add content to the list of favorites as well (just enter a tag or URL). <br><br>  Another interesting innovation is the opportunity to study the dossier on any blog: here are its topics, tag list, update frequency, Technorati rating, photo and author's name, number of subscribers and their list.  There is a window for full-text search on this blog. <br><br>  A detailed presentation with a demonstration of new Technorati functions can be viewed <a href="">on the video</a> (5 min. 46 sec., 28 MB). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4206/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4206/</a></p>
