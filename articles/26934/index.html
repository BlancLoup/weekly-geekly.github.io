And when not on its own - it is better to write than to suffer in silence.  Shakes something inside.  Tolley tea is drunk, toli from people.  Toli from the position.  Although what is the situation here. <br><br>  Tomorrow again get down to business.  At six in the morning the phone is sawing-pilip.  Sausage, natural coffee (op-pa, and no coffee without any), 20 minutes shower, diary.  Habr, Thirst (zhazhda.ru), classmates, maybe news2, thirst again, jdu.ru, thirst again, there are two more people hanging there. <br><br>  Psychologists say that in addition to well-studied tensions governing a person, there is also a dick not studied 'physis'.  This is the desire of all life to growth and life.  That same thirst for life.  What you do not do with the living, but she is always with them.  And if it is not - tyts, suicide.  And why it is, why it is not - is not clear.  Why chemical processes in the body with thousands of possible options occur in such a way that it leads to growth - FIG really knows - it's just physis and that's it.  And if it is not there, everything will end quickly enough.

      I have fizis disappears.  Day or two.  When it comes to the wall, and there is nowhere else to go, you start from it, as if from the bottom of the sea. <br><br>  In childhood, when I was still swimming badly, I loved to hold my breath and dive deeper, descend until you meet the bottom with your feet, and when you meet, you shrink and push like a spring.  If it is good to straighten up, you can suddenly jump out, like a dolphin :) Once it went down, it went down, but there was no bottom.  Already the air ends.  Upstairs rowing - there is not enough oxygen, the speed is small, and swimming is bad.  And it‚Äôs already scary downstairs - it‚Äôs unknown where the bottom is, maybe with one jump and it‚Äôs not possible to jump out - then there‚Äôs definitely not enough air.  I do not know what worked fizis or fatigue, but decided to go down.  All the same, it would all be over.  Already the ears are laying and dark somehow ... Ah, here is one bottom, soft is not noticeable.  You are no longer nervous, calm, you know, only one chance, and it is better to be calm, do not spend oxygen in vain.  He squeezed tightly, as hard as he could, stopped for a second and ‚Äî arrow up!  Streamlined all such as superman, damn it, and you feel around the flow of water, you wait to the last, to the last, to the last!  Now you are not moving, paddle your hands ... si-si!  It did not work like a dolphin, it turned out like an old grandfather - yyyyk ... aaaa, kh-kh-kh ... <br><br>  Physi ... <br><br>  In life, I noticed the exact same garbage.  When something presses you against the wall, you descend, everything seems to be bad and not at all, and then you understand, it will not last forever, and after a while, you feel solid ground under your feet.  Deep but firm.  He stood up stronger, walked, rested, calmed down, rethought, but in general, everything is not so bad, low, but surely.  Normal such soil underfoot.  If you wish, you can so shrink and jump - that even fly away! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26934/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26934/</a></p>
