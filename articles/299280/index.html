  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ministry of Finance pulls the Ministry of Economic Development to its side in a dispute about the extension of benefits to Russian IT companies</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation continues to oppose the extension of the term of preferential insurance premiums for IT companies.  Until the end of 2017, Russian IT companies that have undergone special accreditation at the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media pay a preferential premium rate of 14% instead of the standard 30%.  As conceived by the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media, the rate will rise to 21% in 2018, to 28% in 2019, and from January 1, 2020 it will reach the standard 30%. <br><br>  According to the ministry, if the tax burden on domestic IT companies increases in 2018, they will not be able to compete with foreign corporations, including the possibility of inviting high-quality professionals to work.  And this, in turn, will affect the economy of Russia. <br><br>  The Ministry of Finance argues its position, paying attention to the deficit of the federal budget, as well as the budgets of social security funds and compulsory medical insurance.  In addition, the agency recalls that, following the May decree of Russian President Vladimir Putin, a strategy was developed for the long-term development of the pension system.  According to the strategy, after the expiration of the benefits, the state will no longer support the industry due to mandatory pension insurance. <a name="habracut"></a>

      The Ministry of Finance reiterated its position in writing and sent it to the Ministry of Economic Development, Vedomosti <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2016/03/14/633330-minfin-vozrazhaet-protiv-it-lgot">reports</a> , citing Deputy Finance Minister Ilya Trunin. <br><br>  Earlier, in October 2015, the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/20004">proposed</a> to extend the 14% tariff until the end of 2023, and finally cancel the benefits only in 2026.  However, here the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Labor agreed that the state cannot afford such ‚Äúluxury‚Äù. <br><br>  In November 2014, the Council of the Federation was going to make the extension of benefits in its resolution on the development of information technologies and measures to support domestic production of communication facilities.  The Ministry of Finance then opposed the extension, while the Ministry of Economic Development, on the contrary, supported it.  As a result, the senators abandoned this item. <br><br>  Anyway, the Ministry of Finance should submit to President Putin proposals on the extension of reduced insurance premiums for IT companies. <br><br>  In December 2015, at the Internet-economy forum, the general director of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infowatch">Infowatch,</a> Natalya Kasperskaya, told the president that, thanks to the existing benefits, by 2014, sales of Russian software increased to 102 billion (in 2010 they did not exceed 28 billion rubles).  She complained that in 2017 they want to cancel the privilege.  ‚ÄúI agree with you absolutely.  The only question is that it needs to be done somehow, without violating WTO rules, ‚ÄùPutin answered her. <br><br>  On March 1 of this year, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved the government‚Äôs anti-crisis plan, one of the points of which was also the extension of lower insurance premium rates.  According to the document, the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Labor should develop and submit a corresponding bill before the end of June 2016, remind Vedomosti. <br><br>  According to Evgenia Vasilenko, Executive Director of the Association of Software Developers <a href="http://www.arppsoft.ru/">ARPP Otechestvenniy Soft</a> , a feature of IT companies is that about 80% of the costs of such companies are labor.  And the tax, usually calculated on the basis of the size of the payment fund, becomes negotiable for such companies.  And the increase in insurance premiums significantly reduces the opportunities of companies. <br><br>  Vasily Markov, director of tax benefits for the consulting company <a href="http://www.deloitte.com/ru">Deloitte,</a> points out that in the long run, this circumstance cannot but affect investment decisions on opening or reducing the number of development centers in Russia - because IT companies are very mobile. <br><br>  The refusal to extend the benefits will entail either a degradation of the business, or a transition to gray payment schemes, deputy director of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABBYY">ABBYY</a> Anna Zharkova told Vedomosti.  According to her, companies will have to compensate for their losses: to reduce personnel, close research projects, for which the saved money was spent. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299280/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299280/</a></p>
