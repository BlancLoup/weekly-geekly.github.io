  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Information and analytical system for monitoring and managing road safety</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It all started with the fact that I went to study at a driving school in 2009.  Compared to the race cars, which I managed in computer games, it seemed to me very uncomfortable to control a real car, a lot of unnecessary actions that automation or electronics can do.  Why clutch pedal?  Why does the car stall?  Why do I need to transfer to neutral speed?  And so on.  I had many such questions.  I assume that my questions are partially solved on new cars.  But after driving school, which I graduated successfully, I was not able to sit behind the wheel.  Maybe for the better.  There is no machine, it is not expected in the near future, and, in general, it is not necessary. <br><br>  Since then, I began to theorize, fantasize and apply virtual solutions for specific situations that I have seen on the roads in the vehicle cabin.  How would act the system invented by me.  Over time, these images began to take shape in the big picture.  In 2011, I met a man with whom I could talk on this topic.  I told how I see all this, and he shared his opinion.  He has his own car, and he is an active participant in traffic with experience. <br><br>  At the end of 2012, the idea occurred to me that it was impossible to dwell on the development of a system only for vehicles, it was necessary to think more widely.  So the system has new nodes.  I called them: Car, Road, Traffic Light, Server.

      It took me several months to think about the connections between the nodes of the system.  In this article, I will show what came out of it.  The image below shows schematically the information transfer path. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d66/7bc/21f/d667bc21f3170925adeb2c5e120e78b7.png"><br><br>  In the center of the picture is a server that receives and sends information. <br>  On the right is a traffic light, at the top is a car, and on the left is a road (signs are used for greater clarity). <br><br><br>  Next, I propose to become more familiar with the data that the system nodes transmit and receive. <br><br>  <b>Machine -&gt;
