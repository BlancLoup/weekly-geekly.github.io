Consequently, all firms without exception must keep records!  And for the lack of such accounting, you can pay a fine. <br><br>  Any organization is obliged to document the receipt, movement, inventory and disposal of precious metals contained in the components of office equipment (computers, televisions, etc.) in accordance with: <br><br><ul><li>  Federal Law dated March 26, 1998 No. 41 FZ "On Precious Metals and Precious Stones" (paragraph 2 of Article 20); </li><li>  The instruction on the procedure for accounting and storage of precious metals and precious stones, products from them and reporting in their production and handling, approved by order of the Ministry of Finance of Russia dated August 29, 2001.  No. 68n .: <br>  ‚Äú... Organizations are obliged to keep records of precious metals and precious stones in all types and states, including precious metals and precious stones that are part of fixed and circulating assets, purchased component parts ...‚Äù (Clause 6.3) <br></li></ul><br><br>  Violators face fines under article 19.14.  Administrative Code.  For an organization, it ranges from 20 to 30 thousand rubles, and for its leader - from 2 to 3 thousand rubles.  In addition, for violation of the procedure for keeping records of operations with precious metals, the organization also bears tax liability.  The absence of accounting for precious metals contained in fixed assets can be viewed as an incorrect reflection on business accounting and reporting of business transactions and material values, which entails, according to article 120 of the RF Tax Code, a fine of 5 to 15 thousand rubles.  In addition, the non-arrival of scrap and waste containing precious metals in cases of write-off of fixed assets leads to an underestimation of profits and underpayment of income tax.  According to the materials ‚ÄúAccounting, taxes, law‚Äù No. 4, February 1-7, 2005 (Precious spare part, S.M. Matveyev) <br><br>  Accordingly, once there are precious metals, only organizations registered in the Assay Chamber can produce recycling of computer equipment.  This is also a requirement. <br><br>  Utilization of equipment must be carried out in accordance with the ‚ÄúMethodology of work on the complex utilization of secondary precious metals from spent computer equipment‚Äù, approved by the State Committee of the Russian Federation on Telecommunications (October 19, 1999). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/366577/">https://habr.com/ru/post/366577/</a></p>
