Before that, I created accounts under different nicknames, names ... But after the university, participation in projects and the ‚Äúspotted‚Äù real name on the Internet, I began to think.  We all know that now you either agree with the privacy policy and provide access to personal data, use the service, or refuse the service rules and do not use it at all.  Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, VK and all other social networks, as well as many sites follow, accumulate and trade our data.  Using them in areas ranging from advertising, statistics, taste analysis, to terrorism, fraud, or their detection. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dfc/7b8/fbb/dfc7b8fbb27f512222fc50de434f567c.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Objective:</b> to build your identity on the Internet with maximum benefit and with minimal risk for yourself and your loved ones. <br><br>  It is worth thinking and weighing different options:

    <h5>  1. Open personality </h5><br>  Use the real name in all used sites and, turning a blind eye to privacy, avoid paranoia.  Yes, most people now do just that.  This option is the easiest and most convenient, but not the safest.  Yes, you will be easily found on Google.  You will be more trusted on the forums and in various sites with a social element.  Your lost classmates and work colleagues will find you to recommend you to others, as well as the employers themselves will find you. <br><br>  But there is another side to the coin.  Thieves, scammers, spammers, enemies, or authorities can easily find you or your Internet activity.  It is also important to remember that your full name is one for life.  And although you can change it, it‚Äôs not always easy (depending on where you live) and not always ethical.  You have one chance.  An error, and your personality is tied to it for the rest of its life (the Internet will not forgive - it is unlikely that it will be possible to delete what goes there).  The games you have played, failed courses online, or low ratings on Coursera, Codeacademy, or other resources ‚Äî everything will remain there.  Participation in dating sites, photos with obscene behavior (yours or those on which you are marked), all this gives a negative assessment of your online identity or just information that can be used against you. <br><br><h5>  2. Completely hidden real identity </h5><br>  Fictional name, nickname, pseudonym.  The first thing that is lost is the connection between your name and Internet activity.  No classmates, no employers, no one can check on your name who you are and what you do.  This is both good and bad.  The presence of a prokachannogo profile with participation in projects or published software, significantly increases the likelihood of getting to work crossing several stages of selection at once, as compared with the absence of such a profile or being nobody on the Internet at all. <br><br>  You can try to link your real identity with a hidden one by sending employers a link to your ‚Äúsecond self‚Äù in a resume.  But this approach firstly causes suspicions about you, and secondly there is a risk that your pumped-up profile will be blocked because you did not follow the agreement and rules of the site.  Today, the site's policy allows pseudonyms, and tomorrow it can be changed, and with this the possibility of changing your name will disappear.  This may seem unlikely, but there is still a risk.  It is also not clear how to participate in various contests, meetings and sweepstakes.  What name to write?  Hidden or present?  By the hidden you are likely to violate the rules of participation in the competition because  it says that they will need to be identified.  And with this you are on the Internet, no one and your participation will remain invisible, without giving any bonus to your profile. <br><br>  It is important to remember that no matter how carefully you hide, it‚Äôs all the same and you send important documents to Gmail and other mailboxes.  From large services the identity can be hidden only with great difficulty.  But our goal is to minimize risk and not avoid it at all. <br><br><h5>  3. Two or more personalities </h5><br>  Here you can purchase any desired image and change the mask while observing clear boundaries and rules.  For career growth to use one person.  For personal affairs, forums, something not entirely legal (piracy, politics, immigration) is different.  With this approach, it is important not to forget about the border that divides your two personalities.  This makes it inconvenient and even sometimes will raise doubts - should I post this to that person?  Or maybe both?  In parallel, to lead two individuals is not productive and there is a risk of failure of such a ‚Äúcamouflage‚Äù when the borders cross or someone will expose you. <br><br><h4>  Eventually </h4><br>  On this topic there are a lot of articles on various IT resources that describe the risks, hazards, weighted pros and cons of an open or hidden person online.  But not one of them completely does not answer my question.  After consulting with more experienced people and colleagues, I could not find a solution.  Some of them use services to a limited extent, others hide under their nicknames, and some simply don‚Äôt soar and let themselves know.  Take, for example, my former teachers, all openly publish everything under a real name.  How does this issue are solved by Google employees?  What do celebrities or just millions of people who openly publish their photos under their name?  According to their posts, it is not difficult to calculate the contacts, the place of residence and create an approximate picture of the human condition.  Then you can use data leakage at any site (HeartBleed ...) or use one of the many methods of data theft, password cracking, penetration, phishing, etc.  (By the way, on FourSquare, you can trace at home) <br><br>  PS: <br>  I wanted to ask a question on the toaster, but the description turned out to be too long ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/221017/">https://habr.com/ru/post/221017/</a></p>
