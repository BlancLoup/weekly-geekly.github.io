I know there are people who do not like planning.  There are people who do not like to think.  There are those who simply do not understand how his body works.  I have been in all these states, sharing experiences. <br><br>  The method is based on one thought: there is only one day, today, in which you need to do everything to the maximum for the result. <br><br>  Under the cut a simple scheme how to achieve this. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      So, the approach consists in the following steps: <br><ul><li>  We buy for ourselves such notebook which we can carry everywhere with us. <br><br></li><li>  The first week we go and carry it everywhere with us.  We write down our dreams, what we think about, what we would like.  For example, they went, they saw a car - they wrote down: ‚Äúbuy a car‚Äù.  It is desirable to set a specific goal with the date - ‚Äúto buy a used Japanese for 200,000 rubles for this new year‚Äù.  The reality of what we are recording is not important - if it is difficult to figure out, think up details (concreteness - the date when you want to do what you are thinking about, cost, a description of what it is).  We go, and write in a notebook.  And it is necessary to record when the desire to have it is covered.  You can keep a notebook for two weeks - that's better, but for a start one week.  The format of the record is not important - just clear, so that you can then make out.  <b>The only thing - you need to record EVERYWHERE, even on the street, even on the subway, not to be too lazy to write down, if the thought came that we would like such a thing.</b> <br><br></li><li>  On Saturday or Sunday we sit down in a quiet place, well-fed, sleepy, contented, take a notebook.  <b>And look through the desires that are written out.</b>  <b>If a point does not cause the very excitement that was when it was written - we delete it.</b>  We pass on the entire list.  The next day - exactly the same.  And so on until there are 10 or less things that you always want.  If you want more, then you just need to take the first 10 things and discard the rest.  Life is long, you will have time to work with the whole list. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Write in notepad 10 things that you want, one page so that you can cover the eye.</b> <br><br></li><li>  <b>Then draw a sign (see below).</b>  Vertically 10 things, horizontally - the numbers for the next week.  Very simple table. <br><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td>  October 2010 <br></td><td>  18 <br></td><td>  nineteen <br></td><td>  20 <br></td><td>  21 <br></td><td>  22 <br></td><td>  23 <br></td><td>  24 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Charging <br></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  Check in at 6:00 <br></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  Do without bread <br></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  Buy a car <br></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  Save for vacation <br></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  Go to the cinema <br></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  Call friends <br></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  Go to the theater <br></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  Get out <br></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  Learn italian <br></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br></li><li>  For the next week every day, keep a notebook on hand while looking at the list of items that has been written out.  <b>And every day, since only he is real, strive to do something to achieve the goal.</b>  Even such a trifle, how to save money to buy a car and not buy an expensive trinket, but to put money into the bank will do.  But we are talking only about actions, and not about thinking about what would be good to do this and that. <br><br></li><li>  <b>At the end of each day, before going to bed, look through the list, and tick, if at least a small real step towards the goal is made.</b>  You need to be honest and come up with a criterion for yourself, how to measure - was it a step or not.  By experience, if you tick more than five points, you either lie to yourself, or already manage your business well and know what you want. <br><br></li><li>  <b>At the end of the week, again in a relaxed atmosphere, see the number of checkmarks set in a week.</b>  <b>Where the most ticks - so you really want to do.</b>  Where there are no ticks - you simply convinced yourself that you need it, or someone convinced you.  The strength of the records is that if you briefly powder the head a person can himself (or the seller, or someone else), but to make a person believe for a long time in what is unnatural for himself is difficult. <br><br></li><li>  Having counted the number of ticks, you throw out 5 of those goals, where there are the least ticks.  Now you do not need them.  And the remaining 5 goals are divided into 10 smaller ones, if possible.  Also enter, if there is free space in the table, other goals that were not included in the top ten last time.  <b>And you continue these processes through iterations: writing down what you want, writing out 10 goals, checking during the week what you are really doing to achieve, screening.</b>  Why does this work?  Two things work.  First, the movement in any direction will be in the presence of actions, not thoughts or thoughts.  The second is that a person who is constantly concentrating throughout the week gradually reveals the main vectors, what to do with it, and by focusing on what he really wants, he achieves excellent results.  For me personally, this approach, which I invented on my knee, helped determine priorities after graduation from a university, in a difficult situation, when I wanted to work in four directions at once. <br><br></li><li>  <b>You can write anything to the table: you want to become what you want to communicate with, where to go, what kind of habit you should develop.</b>  It is necessary not to write things ‚Äúnot‚Äù - charged, for example, instead of ‚Äúnot to be ill‚Äù, it is necessary to write ‚Äúto recover‚Äù, instead of ‚Äúnot to drink‚Äù - ‚Äúto lead a sober way of life‚Äù.  You know, they say that from what we are trying to run away, we come to that.  This happens because our subconscious mind does not perceive the particle ‚Äúnot‚Äù.  We think: ‚Äúnot to be ill‚Äù, but it comes to ‚Äúill‚Äù.  And self-hypnosis is a very powerful thing, the effect that has been proven in practice.  Therefore, we need to direct our forces to where we are striving, and not to what we want to run away from. <br></li></ul><br><br>  If someone has already invented this, or there is a better option - offer improvements in the comments! <br><br>  <b>UPD: We advised a great <a href="http://42goals.com/">site</a> and <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fs%3D5e689e61aa62cbbc12465819842012eb%26showtopic%3D194001">application for Android</a> to automate the process!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/105970/">https://habr.com/ru/post/105970/</a></p>
