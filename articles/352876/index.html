Hold on to me, do as I do, and everything will be chiki-bunches. <br><br>  Sergey has always been infuriated with such a collective farm style of communication, especially among unfamiliar people.  It is not clear how to respond.  It seems necessary to call an idiot in the face, but you never know, suddenly a person is not always like that, he just does not know how to express emotions with words.  Moreover, Sergey is the first day at this work.  At his first real job. <br><br>  - Kohl, let's more serious.  - Jeanne strictly looked at the round smug face.  Then she looked at the new one.  - Sergey, do not listen to this old horse.  Of course, he will not spoil the furrows, but he will not lift virgin lands.

      Sergei had to smile - after all, the chief was joking, and it seems not entirely hopeless. <br><br>  - We have high hopes for you, Serozha.  Nikolay is loaded with a stream of information, we have a lot of it.  We understand that we are acting inefficiently, somewhere we are missing something, we are using outdated technologies and approaches ... But we really have no time to stop, think, see, learn.  As Covey wrote - sharpen the saw. <br><br>  Sergey knowingly shook his head.  He did not know who Covey was, but he understood the metaphor. <br><br>  - You are young, goal-oriented, not burdened with obligations and connections, ambitious, and very clever programmer.  You have a full-time Bauman behind you.  We expect from you a new stream of fresh air, a leap in the development of our systems, a breakthrough of cloud technologies.  So, and the only way! <br><br>  - Thank you, Zhanna Ivanovna.  I will try. <br><br>  - No middle name, just Jeanne!  Wellcome to our team, Serge! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Spring </h4><br>  - And what I like!  That I myself can configure the check in any form? <br><br>  - Yes, Jeanne, almost.  The form is not any, but only for data objects.  Orders, for example, or goods.  Any checks, for any fields, taking into account the entire available context, and all - without programming. <br><br>  - Seriously?  This is gorgeous!  Previously, such checks could only Kohl do.  Remember, Kohl, you still have difficulties constantly when, when checking, it is necessary not to compare with primitives, but with Guides. <br><br>  - I remember, why not remember something.  - Kohl thoughtfully scratched his unshaven cheek.  - Only this, difficulties arise only for the first time, when conscience still does not allow to write a specific guid in the code, in quotes, and to compare with it, he-he-he ... It‚Äôs like the honor of losing something ... <br><br>  - How to get dirty in the mud.  - supported Sergey.  - While not dirty - scary, bypassing puddles per kilometer, a lot of time you spend on it, but you go clean.  And then bang - and you are already up to the top of the head in the mud.  And everything, already pofigu on dirt, you can spank on puddles - quickly and without tension.  True, no longer neat. <br><br>  - So, I did not understand, but this is your thing with checks ... What did you do with it, I forgot?  Reactor? <br><br>  - React.  Strictly speaking, I redid all our forms into a reagent, into one component, and the test already attached to the side is another component.  But it is not important. <br><br>  - Oke, the reactor ... Is he talking about walking in the mud and not being afraid? <br><br>  - No, he removed the dirt at all.  You can just walk, all the sidewalks are clean and beautiful, around the spring and the birds are singing.  One code, one component, tens and hundreds of different forms.  Threw tens of thousands of lines almost identical code. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThat's what I love this guy for!‚Äù  Come on, Seryozha!  And Kohl pull up to modern technology!  Kohl, agree? <br><br>  - Dak and cho, well.  Well why not catch up, if the topic is correct. <br><br>  - Well, okay, well, if so.  By the way, Kohl, what about accounting?  It turned out to close on time? <br><br>  - There is no such month that I would not close in 1C.  It turned out, clear dick. <br><br>  - I will ask without expressions.  Do you close it yourself? <br><br>  ‚ÄúWell, not theirs, the hands, to teach ... Oh, soryan, it broke out ...‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúOkay, well, now ... The main thing is that I‚Äôve met the deadlines for the reporting, otherwise we wouldn‚Äôt have to work out, and no reactors will help.‚Äù  All right, no distractions, no pasaran! <br><br><h4>  Summer </h4><br>  - And what is the great meaning, Seryozha?  How is this approach better? <br><br>  - Zhanna, this is the processing speed, the degree of automation, the elimination of data duplication, managed reference information transport, administration costs, uniqueness ... <br><br>  ‚ÄúAnd a thick, thick layer of chocolate ...‚Äù Kohl broke into a smile. <br><br>  - Kolya is good.  I showed you everything yesterday and explained, did you agree, what are you talking about now? <br><br>  - Yes, I agree, a normal topic.  Just do not take a damn, and crap up the ass. <br><br>  - Why, Kohl?  Explain?  - Jeanne, for some reason, missed the next portion of the French past the ears. <br><br>  - Yes, what is there to explain ... Now everything works, all systems are synchronized, operators work clearly, there are few errors.  Cho finally can climb there? <br><br>  - Damn, how what?  - Sergey began to lose patience.  - You do not float storage in five bases of the same, in fact, the table of the nomenclature, but with different keys, the composition of the fields, and even a pancake, names and part numbers? <br><br>  - It does not soar, there are also correspondence tables and data exchanges. <br><br>  - Correspondence tables?  Which twice is more, than tables of the nomenclature ?!  And while they also do not solve their problems, because they store point-to-point correspondence?  BUT?  Try to compare the nomenclature from the site and specifications from PLM or PDM! <br><br>  - 1C is normally compared, it knows the correspondences with the site and PLM, with each separately. <br><br>  - Do you hear yourself?  After 1C match ... Unload a new product from the PDM with the specification, load it into 1C, match the components with 1CN, create the missing positions, match them, upload to the site, add properties, load a photo manually, in the same way unload PDM 3D- model, upload to site ... OK? <br><br>  - Not very optimal, of course, but it works, but what did you do? <br><br>  - It works, which is not.  The FIU also works!  And now attention: the designer changed the bolt in the specification, took instead GOSTovsky DINovsky.  What are you going to do?  Repeat the entire specification to drive? <br><br>  - Nakhera ... They will dump me a position, I will quickly change my hands in all places ... <br><br>  - Right quick?  But don't you remember, last month you were looking for who bought a box of hardened springs for one and a half million, and the standard has been prescribed for a long time in the specification? <br><br>  - This is the operators nakosyachili.  Now all changes pass through me.  I have a nod on the spot. <br><br>  - I ... I have no words.  Programmer directories leads.  If there are ten - TEN - operators, with a total salary of 250 thousand rubles a month, not counting taxes, contributions, depreciation, management costs ... <br><br>  - Look, how many clever words have learned ... Yes, the words are all Russian, not react with angulyar and redux ... It‚Äôs good for you to work at the plant, but with such a good dude like me.  He said, all chiki-bunches will be. <br><br>  - So, that's enough.  - Jeanne, who still followed the discussion with interest, felt an approach to a dangerous line.  - Sergey is right, but Nikolai too.  In any system there is non-optimality, redundancy and a field for improvements.  But I will ask you not to forget that we are not writing the coursework, but we are carrying out the tasks of a real business, with all the consequences ... <br><br>  - Isn‚Äôt real business profitable to disperse a bunch of senseless employees who can be replaced with a normal MDM system? <br><br>  - Profitable, hard to argue.  But you need to understand the timing and cost of this project.  In words, everything sounds beautiful, but for now these are just words.  If I go to the general now, propose this project, then we will not be able not to complete it.  Are you sure that you took into account all the nuances of real life?  Pitfalls, transition difficulties, sabotage during implementation?  The same operators and their boss - how will they react to the implementation?  Their forces because your MDM fill.  How well will they fill the system that will replace them? <br><br>  - Well, I did not think about it, to be honest.  But I am ready to vouch for technology, because I saw the source code and their real work.  The same CouchDB, with automatic replication ... <br><br>  - Sergey, I understood about technology.  But technology alone is not enough.  We have leadership, projects, tasks, deadlines.  Bonus in the end.  By the way, did you get an annual prize? <br><br>  - Oh yeah!  If I‚Äôm in profile, you‚Äôll see where she‚Äôs settled, he-he-he ... <br><br>  - Yes, and you don‚Äôt need to look, you can guess from the amber how yesterday you were glad.  Any questions? <br><br>  ‚ÄúYes, if you can ... Why does Nikolay have double the amount?‚Äù <br><br>  - For the help of accounting in closing the year and preparing for the tax audit, which we successfully passed. <br><br>  - Learn student!  This is not for you to piss sneakers! <br><br>  - And my projects?  Refactoring the site?  Optimizing DBMS performance?  Single authorization service?  Microservice through pricing? <br><br>  - Well, these are good and useful projects, Sergey, I understand that perfectly.  But I do not know how to explain this to management.  It is necessary to consider the economic effect, data on metrics to collect, etc.  And it is better to do this before the start of work in order to have objective data.  You didn't do this, did you? <br><br>  - I thought, the benefits of these works are obvious ... I did not think that later I would have to prove something ... <br><br>  - By themselves, only cats are born!  Or whatever ... Yes, shit ... <br><br>  - Zhanna, I would like to understand how in the future such projects ... <br><br>  - Everything, I need to go to the meeting, Sergei, let's another time. <br><br><h4>  Autumn </h4><br>  - Sergey, on the RAM today you were praised, it was very nice to hear. <br><br>  - What is praised for? <br><br>  - For the integration of 1C and Bitrix, which you did.  This is a very necessary, timely and high-quality solution.  It is especially good that you met in a short time, and did not oppose, like ... As you did before. <br><br>  - This is not a solution, but ... shit, I apologize.  If they praise for this, then I do not know ... <br><br>  - Smile and wave, smile and wave!  - Kolya was right there.  - You cho, boots, sit and be silent. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOkay ...‚Äù Sergey somehow awkwardly smiled.  - And who praised? <br><br>  - The commercial director most of all, it was important for him to launch integration and an online store this quarter, this is his plan for the strategic session.  He also has a deputy in supply, he can now quickly receive bids from customers, without waiting for processing in the sales department. <br><br>  - Ha, it is necessary to shake off Magarych from them, especially from a commercial one!  He has a quarter quarter premium of three hundred, and only thanks to you will he receive it.  Come on, Serge, let's go, let's try it with him! <br><br>  - I don‚Äôt know ... I think this system will have to be redone, refactoring is needed there.  I used the typical integration tools that Bitrix provides.  There is such a shit ... Actually, just like Beatrix himself ... He would also be replaced - who decided to do a site on it at all? <br><br>  - This decision was made based on the results of a deep and comprehensive analysis of existing proposals for CMS and, in general, platforms for website development. <br><br>  - So when was it?  Then there really was nothing else that could be called a platform or a product.  Only bare html, php, etc.  Now there are dozens and hundreds of technologies, platforms and frameworks, each head and shoulders above Beatrix.  Let's‚Ä¶ <br><br>  - Let's not go!  You're weird, like a hedgehog in the fog.  What difference to hells, on what the site and how it is synchronized with 1C, if everything works?  Serious people expressed gratitude to you, in public.  What more do you want, dog? <br><br>  - No, I agree that it is good when it works.  It's just ... I don't know ... It's all wrong ... <br><br>  - Let me for you then get a premium this quarter, just wrong!  And you will go on to do your own refactoring, and smoke frameworks! <br><br>  - Keep your pocket wider, bast.  I need the prize myself, I have a mortgage. <br><br>  - Sergey, can you formulate your proposal more systematically, by changing the platform of the site?  Terms, cost, competencies required.  And the main thing is the problematic, what is wrong there. <br><br>  - Yes, everything is wrong there, in the basis, in the foundation. <br><br>  - Well, at least you can show me?  Or Kolya?  I always use the site and the internal portal, and I don‚Äôt remember that there were any obvious mistakes or inconveniences ... <br><br>  ‚ÄúThere you have to look at the code, metadata that is not there, a clumsy DBMS that is not suitable for real large projects.‚Äù  I would change everything there.  No, not so - just would have replaced Bitrix, redid the site.  Although it is a year‚Äôs work, no less ... <br><br>  - Here I am about the same, Sergey.  Modern technology is good, but we do not work in Google, but in the real business, there are very different needs.  Although, of course, do not forget about development. <br><br>  - You understand here, Zhanna, we must bear in mind not only the current tasks, but also the development, the future of our systems.  In the current state, the system is becoming more severe and dependent, there is no possibility to make quick changes. <br><br>  - Well, you somehow made a quick integration? <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt's a quick crutch, not an integration.‚Äù  Well, it is typical.  And if you need atypical integration, then quickly it will not work. <br><br>  - We will pray that we do not need such crap!  And if they ask, we will beat out the budget!  And we hire some mediocrity, so that we all remade! <br><br>  - This is called outsourcing, Kolyan. <br><br>  - Zina!  We, too, are not done with a finger! <br><br>  ‚ÄúWell, yes, so you are right ... Let the contractors pick your ass if necessary ...‚Äù <br><br>  - Seryozha, what kind of expressions ... <br><br>  - Yes, I beg your pardon, Jeanne.  Is it really possible to get a bonus for this integration? <br><br>  - Of course, no questions asked.  Today I will deal with this issue, under the good mood of the authorities.  General, too, was present at the RAM.  You just do not go and do not tell at every corner that with Bitrix something is wrong. <br><br>  - Clear dick, not the first year married .- cheerfully, with mock enthusiasm shouted Sergei. <br><br>  - Note!  I am also a grave! <br><br><h4>  Winter </h4><br>  - Great!  - Kolyan pulled away from the monitor, and looked at a satisfied Sergey.  - Where were you?  On the women went? <br><br>  - You can say so, cho.  In the accounting department was sitting. <br><br>  - Half a day?  Did they tire you there?  There are ten of them, one more beautiful than the other. <br><br>  - This is our secret with them will be what we did there ... - Sergei portrayed the lovelace smile. <br><br>  - So, enough of such topics when I discuss.  Seriously, Sergey, what were you doing? <br><br>  - The month was closed, what else in the accounting department to do.  Sat, wiring checked, reduced driving. <br><br>  - What for, you cho, damn it.  - Kolyan flared up.  - I taught them two weeks in this quarter how to close a month, they got it, even me.  Let them close themselves, we are programmers, not accountants. <br><br>  - Well, go, prove to them that you are a programmer, and they will cope.  No shit they can not.  Beautiful big eyes made, "Seryozha, help, we pressed something here, and everything broke." <br><br>  - Listen, well, I did not expect this from you.  Who shouted all the time that doing accounting, and in general 1C - unworthy of a decent programmer? <br><br>  - I do not know.  I probably.  Generally, back off for a change.  I have provided us with a prize, honor and respect.  After a week of income tax, if you forgot. <br><br>  - You deepened our grave by half a meter!  Well, I listened to you, idiot, I even believed a little that I was engaged in garbage, started to teach them, automated some checks from them so that they wouldn‚Äôt get any more! <br><br>  - Oh, you, the resurrection of Lazarus ... Or the insight of the blind ... Well, do not yell, next time you go yourself, you will stand over their souls so that they themselves can do everything. <br><br>  - I will go, and I will not ask you!  I'm going right now, I'll give them a dressing, in general, ohreneli!  Sit, ten cows, distract decent people from the correct work! <br><br>  - Nikolai, wait, don't go anywhere.  Not that moment. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhat is the wrong moment, Joan?‚Äù  I've been working here for five years, and the whole moment is not the same!  Two of the accounting department changed, but the whole moment is not the same!  We postpone everything, we postpone, everything afterwards, everything after reporting, but as the quarter ends, so there is no time, things have accumulated, blah blah blah ... I'm tired of doing this fucking bookkeeping, I want to create really useful systems, but not black and red collapse! <br><br>  - Well, so do not do accounting, who makes you.  - Sergey smiled unkindly.  - I will be engaged.  And you pick the frameworks, see the github and pull requests, send them to the same correct boys like you. <br><br>  - You are not 1Snik, Sergey.  - Jeanne was in disarray.  - Your key competencies seem to be in web programming. <br><br>  - Let them lie, it‚Äôs a pity.  As there will be a task on web programming, and I will be engaged.  In the meantime, the company needs to take reports, or download price lists from files, or configure the Wi-Fi director, I will do just that. <br><br>  - Well ... In general, I'm glad to hear that.  And you, Nikolai, please do not forget that in the first place are always the needs of a real business, and not self-development.  We are not a university. <br><br>  - Yes, what self-development, Jeanne!  I‚Äôm for an enterprise and try, not for myself!  I just want to make it so that we, programmers, do not need to do any nonsense.  We did not study for this, and you did not hire us to do this! <br><br>  - Allow me to judge why I took you to work ... I hear you, I understand your concern, but, once again: business problems come first, always.  If necessary, I myself am engaged in similar work. <br><br>  - Yes, you do not listen to him, Jeanne.  Kolyan seems to have indigestion.  Again, shit ate without a spoon, hehe hehe ... <br><br>  ‚ÄúYes, you go, the opportunist is bloody ...‚Äù <br><br>  - So, that's enough!  I will not allow discord in the team!  Both of you are right, both are taking care of your native enterprise, even though you disagree.  But now, in difficult times of crisis, it is necessary to step on the throat of his song and think only about the good of the enterprise. <br><br>  - And do not forget about yourself, what is already there ... Kolya, okay, sorry, don't freak out. <br><br>  - I do not "freak out", dear Sergei.  Zhanna, I will come to you today, we need to seriously talk. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWell, you know where my office is.‚Äù <br><br><h4>  Epilogue </h4><br>  - You, the main thing, not ssy!  Hold on to me, do as I do, and everything will be chiki-bunches. <br><br>  Victor always infuriated such a collective farm style of communication, especially among unfamiliar people.  It is not clear how to respond.  It seems necessary to call an idiot in the face, but you never know, suddenly a person is not always like that, he just does not know how to express emotions with words.  Moreover, Victor is the first day at this work.  At his first real job. <br><br>  - Serge, let's more serious.  - Jeanne strictly looked at the skinny self-satisfied face.  Then she looked at the new one.  - Victor, do not listen to this old horse.  Of course, he will not spoil the furrows, but he will not lift virgin lands. <br><br>  Victor had to smile - after all, the boss joked, and it didn‚Äôt seem completely hopeless. <br><br>  - We have high hopes for you, Victor.  Sergey, we have a full load of workload - there is a lot of it.  We understand that we are acting inefficiently, somewhere we are missing something, we are using outdated technologies and approaches ... But we really have no time to stop, think, see, learn.  As Covey wrote - sharpen the saw. <br><br>  Victor shook his head knowingly.  He did not know who Covey was, but he understood the metaphor. <br><br>  - You are young, goal-oriented, not burdened with obligations and connections, ambitious, and very clever programmer.  You have a full-time Bauman behind you.  We expect from you a new stream of fresh air, a leap in the development of our systems, a breakthrough of cloud technologies.  So, and the only way! <br><br>  - Thank you, Zhanna Ivanovna.  I will try. <br><br>  - No middle name, just Jeanne!  Wellcome to our team, Victor! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/352876/">https://habr.com/ru/post/352876/</a></p>
