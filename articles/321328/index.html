From our experience, we figured out which titles and images work best.  The article briefly explains the main thing that we learned about creatives in native advertising. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Native advertising is the most <a href="https://blog.relap.ru/2016/11/ads-trends/">promising format</a> on the market.  The display native successfully replaces the <a href="https://blog.relap.ru/2015/07/banners/">inefficient</a> banner formats: advertising is embedded in the tape, is not annoying and inspires confidence - <a href="http://nativeadvertising.com/study-so-how-exactly-do-millennials-feel-about-in-feed-ads/">80% of users</a> prefer advertisements of this type.

      But you can enjoy all the profits of the display natively only if you follow a simple rule: advertising must fit well into the content of the site.  To make it easier for you to achieve success, we have compiled a short guide about: <br><br><ul><li>  how to choose the right picture for advertising; </li><li>  how to choose a title; </li><li>  how to avoid common mistakes. </li></ul><br>  We have verified that replacing the header and image can <a href="https://blog.relap.ru/2016/04/kak-uluchshit-reklamu/">increase the CTR of advertising 10 times</a> .  And in this article there are examples where working with pictures and headlines helped increase the CTR of the ads to magic 15 times.  Share experience. <br><br><h2>  Advertising is information </h2><br>  Advertising - exactly the same information as other articles on the site.  We discuss with friends new gadgets, sales and travel agencies along with the news of the decrees of Trump.  In everyday life, we do not draw the line between advertising and any other content.  If the news was for some reason interesting to us, we are talking about it. <br><br>  For a brand, this means the following: its advertising should be valuable.  The user is already interested in obtaining useful information.  If someone plans to buy a coffee maker, he will really be happy to know where to do it faster and cheaper.  The better the nonsense understands that for the buyer his message is useful information, the native advertising works better. <br><br><h3>  When you do media advertising, you are competing for attention with articles. </h3><br>  For the user's attention is a constant struggle.  If your advertisement looks like ‚ÄúiPhone 6s, 38 thousand rubles, 36 GB, - 15% ACTION !!!  March ‚Äù- you lost this battle.  In the case of advertising in the media, you almost always lose an interesting text or news.  But if the advertisement looks like useful information, it becomes noticeable. <br><br>  Explain to the user in simple language right in the headline, how you can help him, and he will pay attention to your message. <br><br>  Advertising with interest, kapslokom, shares and heartless listing in the title of all possible services, products and features, written in inhuman language.  They don't write that in the media, and they don't read it in the media.  Talk to the user in a language he understands and answer his questions. <br><br><h3>  Everything seems clear how to do in practice? </h3><br>  You can use the technique <a href="https://blog.relap.ru/2015/11/so_what/">"So what?"</a> .  The list of features and services are facts about your product or service.  And the benefit is why the product is needed by the reader.  To understand what is the use, ask yourself: ‚ÄúSo what?‚Äù. <br><br>  You sell hard drives.  Actually, the disk is needed to store a lot of information.  So what?  Soon the May holidays - holiday season.  You most likely will not have a normal Internet, but you can upload to the disk all the TV shows and movies that were going to watch.  Here is the use in real life.  Headline: "How to take on vacation series, and bring hundreds of photos?". <br><br>  Let us consider with examples how to adapt the message for readers. <br><br><h2>  What images to use? </h2><br>  Nachem with images.  <a href="https://blog.relap.ru/2016/04/kak-uluchshit-reklamu/">90% of users first look at the picture</a> , and then read the title.  Therefore, the task is to find an image that does not just duplicate the title, but also carries an emotion. <br><br>  It should be easy for the user to compare the hero image with him (if there is a hero), or it may be a picture that you want to share or save yourself. <br><br>  <b>Images with people always work better.</b> <br><br>  In 83% of the change of the image of objects in the photo of people gave a CTR increase of 2 times or more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d63/a1e/b05/d63a1eb05cee4a5d9ab7849bea768cc4.png"><br><br>  Try not to use frankly stock photos, whose characters look absolutely unnatural.  During the work, we picked up thousands of pictures to advertisements and chose <a href="https://blog.relap.ru/2016/06/18photo/">adequate drains</a> for ourselves, where you can find good images for creativity. <br><br><h2>  What headlines to use? </h2><br><h3>  There are a few general rules for good native headers. </h3><br>  <b>Help the user</b> <br><br>  It doesn't matter what you advertise.  A person does not buy an abstract product, he buys a solution or an emotion.  Therefore, the headers that describe the specific desire of the buyer, which you can satisfy, work better. <br><br>  <b>Speak ordinary human language</b> <br><br>  People do not like obscure and obscure words, abbreviations and abbreviations.  Simplify the text and title as much as possible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/19f/669/6ce/19f6696ce9a64333bf2f6c91921904cb.png"><br><br><h3>  3 types of headers that work best </h3><br>  <b>Headlines Lists</b> <br><br>  According to statistics from Relap.io, headers-lists collected 3 times more clicks than other headers.  Users feel comfortable when information is systematized.  Everyone loves lists. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2be/93e/7da/2be93e7da1fd4f34a5c37176ae10e5a5.png"><br><br>  <b>Headlines Questions</b> <br><br>  Help in the title to formulate how your product or service will be useful to the user.  Remember that you are trying to save him from some kind of problem.  Used for headlines question words: How?  Where?  Why?  What for?  When? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d68/9d1/9d6/d689d19d6aae4ca79b08b431f337687b.png"><br><br>  <b>Headlines-news</b> <br><br>  The method is well suited for announcing stocks, and advertising fits into the user's news feed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a58/6b0/07c/a586b007c79f425992203e939cac19a0.png"><br><br><h2>  How to make advertising material? </h2><br>  Nativka can lead to any material.  If you bring people to a <a href="https://blog.relap.ru/2016/11/good-landing/">landing</a> page, read about the <a href="https://blog.relap.ru/2016/11/good-landing/">best ways to increase landing conversion</a> .  If your ad leads to an article, we have compiled the basic rules for the design of publications that will help you make good material. <br><br>  <b>Structure is important</b> <br><br>  People prefer not to read, but ‚Äúscan‚Äù the text - to go over it and cling to interesting passages.  This was discovered by the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/">Nielsen Norman Group</a> back in 2008. <br><br>  Avoid the canvas text.  Divide the text into paragraphs with bright subtitles.  So that the reader understands what this or that paragraph will be about. <br><br>  If you need to tell the reader something important - put it at the top of the article.  Do not put important information in the middle of a large paragraph.  Most likely, it will get lost there. <br><br>  <b>If you can show - do not write</b> <br><br>  Accompany articles with images, infographics, videos - show.  Big blocks of text scare.  People spend 2-3 times more time on articles where the volume of images is slightly greater than or equal to the amount of text. <br><br>  <b>Tell personal stories</b> <br><br>  Personal experience stories give 1.5‚Äì3 times more engagement than abstract tips. <br><br>  <b>Mobile traffic feature</b> <br><br>  Visitors often begin to scroll the page before it has loaded.  If you have an advertisement or a subscription form is in the header of the site, it may not be seen. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/321328/">https://habr.com/ru/post/321328/</a></p>
