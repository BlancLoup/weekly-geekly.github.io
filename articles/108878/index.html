  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Another collection of personal experiences about all the already annoying "blind ten-finger method"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I have long written this note to myself as an auto-training. <br>  Do you think it needs to be posted somewhere from a personal blog? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In order to print well with the ‚Äúblind tenfinger method‚Äù, you just need to print. <br>  Nothing more, just print it. <br>  After you type the first 300 kilobytes of text with the ten-finger method, whatever happens, the speed of your fingers should improve noticeably. <br>  You will feel that they will literally "flit" on the keyboard. <br>  After 500 kilobytes, in general, you can count on significant progress. <br>  Megabytes of typed text form motor reactions that no longer need to be monitored.  You just think something, maybe a thought, and all of this, if necessary, ‚Äúspills‚Äù onto the screen (in a text editor). <br>  By the way, for those who are ‚Äúin the tank‚Äù: a megabyte of text is approximately 1,000,000 ‚Äúbukaf‚Äù (if one-byte encoding is implied). <br><br>  At the same time, it is important that this is exactly the text, that is, that the ‚Äúbukavas‚Äù do not repeat. <br>  Never print anything a hundred times, except for the initial exercises.  And, yes, in them it is best to focus not on speed, or on correctness, but on memorizing the ‚Äúmotor‚Äù path for the movement of a finger. <br>  The most important thing in this case is that the thought of a person is fastest, faster than speech, faster than fingers, etc.  That is, if at first you just think about how to type something, how to put your fingers correctly and which key to press which finger, then this will be a motor skill. <br>  Some people, after learning how to type with this method, feel a real need to type over and over again, improving their skills, and I am one of them.  I regularly find myself thinking that I want to print something, like, for example, now. <br>  Probably, one can try to explain this by the fact that the pleasure of pumped experience is achieved easier and simpler.  Self-confidence, arising from such a simple, ‚Äúpleasant‚Äù and effective skill like typing on the keyboard ‚Äúblindly‚Äù, with each ‚Äúact‚Äù of typing, if it happens faster and faster, grows exactly with the speed with which the improvement of fingers occurs. set. <br>  The greatest reflection on overconfidence imposes an impression that you begin to experience when you switch from the ‚Äúkeyboard simulator‚Äù program to real thoughts, that is, you start typing your thoughts, and not what is set on the screen. <br>  And, although the speed of typing is somewhat reduced, however, the lack of the need to control your fingers, and the ability to easily express your thoughts, watch for mistakes and correct them in your mind, rather than ‚Äúdictation‚Äù inspire unusually, which is several times enhances the effect.  By the way, after you start typing quickly what you think, the speed in the ‚Äúsimulators‚Äù also increases. <br><br>  In addition, there is a good practice that will help in the future - independence of the number of errors from the position of the hands on the keyboard.  Those.  when one button is finally attached not to a specific finger, but to the place at hand, that is, it belongs to several fingers at once. <br>  At first it seemed to me that the fingers should lie in accordance with one of the specific proposed productions.  Subsequently, I realized that this can not particularly bother.  The fact is that, for example, I have non-standard hands (however, there are hardly two people with exactly the same long fingers, and certainly no one with the same motor skills, this is logical) my fingers are not too long, and my little fingers especially short.  At the same time, the phalanx of the middle finger is thoroughly longer than all the others.  Standard positions are not convenient for me, and the so-called ‚Äútunnel syndrome‚Äù occurs in them, regardless of whether the keyboard is ergonomic or not.  And, in connection with the same features, I do not like keyboards with a long key stroke, I optimally type only on a notebook or on its similarities.

      Yes, you can still notice that in childhood I was fond of playing the guitar, and when I learned to type, it helped a lot.  My hands and, of course, fingers that are accustomed to constant training, did not feel tired even after a few hours of practicing ‚Äútyping‚Äù.  Since I still have not lost interest in the guitar, and the instrument I have, of course, always at hand, I was surprised to find that after practice, it is easier to play the guitar ... As well as vice versa, after a long time playing the guitar , with extensive solo compositions (often ‚Äúhacking‚Äù watch rock and roll em ‚Äúfor the soul‚Äù), the practice of training ‚Äútyping‚Äù is more fun, and the exercises are easier, faster and more accurate. <br>  In addition, I have long noticed that a simple simulator such as a wrist expander significantly increases the power and fitness of the fingers, develops cartilage and arm bones.  The main thing is to maintain a balance between muscle strength and speed. <br>  Let's return to the original thought. <br>  Initially: <br><ul><li>  Thought faster words. </li><li>  The word is faster than typing on the keyboard. </li></ul><br>  After training: <br><ul><li>  Typing on the keyboard is approaching the speed of thought. </li><li>  Special efforts to record something with the speed of speech cannot be applied anymore, since speech becomes much slower than thoughts and fingers. </li></ul><br>  From personal experience, I also note that subsequently the fatigue does not affect the printing speed.  For example, I, working as an analyst, had the experience of writing three-day transcripts of interviews right in the process of these interviews.  Print speed and number of errors are uniform and stable regardless of the time of day. <br>  Thus, the end result of training in the technique of ‚Äútyping‚Äù is the moment when the speed of recruitment will be equal to the speed of thought. <br>  Unfortunately, this limit is unattainable ... <br>  Anyway, a barrier or buffer will be present that is necessary for the passage of an electrical nerve impulse from the brain to the fingers. <br>  BUT!  Approaching this is quite realistic now. <br>  :) <br><br>  It is enough to use some well-known simulators. <br><br>  Off-Line, only the most RU-known: <br><ul><li>  Stamina from Alexey Kazantsev: <a href="http://stamina.ru/">stamina.ru</a> : absolutely Free, a lot of humor, sometimes ‚Äúchorny‚Äù, a lot of pleasure.  Compatible with Windows ‚Ñ¢ and Wine on Linux. </li><li>  Solo on the keyboard <a href="http://ergosolo.ru/">ergosolo.ru</a> : too <a href="http://ergosolo.ru/">boring</a> for me, + excessive control over the learning process by the developer.  They think that they have invented a system of training and "spiritual development", and they are actively promoting it.  Although, however, it is possible that all these "chips" I noticed only. </li></ul><br>  On-Line: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://klavogonki.ru/">klavogonki.ru</a> : ‚ÄúRespect and Respect,‚Äù I have not seen a more exciting simulator. </li><li>  <a href="http://klava.org/">klava.org</a> : stylish, stable, cool, new chips are constantly appearing. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108878/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108878/</a></p>
