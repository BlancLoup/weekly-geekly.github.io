  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What happens to the bitten apple? That's right - it spoils</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Or why the latest MacBooks Pro is one more adok.  The real story with the recently-purchased MacBook Pro in the company, which I took home to set up. </p><br><p>  So, the points: </p><br><p>  <strong>1.</strong> No USB and Ethernet.  It was necessary to transfer a 600MB file from one computer to MacPro.  Stand nearby.  How?  By slow wifi?  Good, but how?  Pour somewhere?  In the cloud?  Two computers are near.  And if 6GB?  And 600GB?  Hell ... (Buy an adapter or fast WiFi - they will tell me - yes, yes, and also the NAS server to go home, so as not to drive files through the whole world when the adapter is lost) </p><br><p>  <strong>2.</strong> Our company has raised vpn via PPTP protocol - we have enough.  The "apples" in the penultimate (?) OS Sierra decided that PPTP should be removed and only l2tp should be left.  Have you ever set up a l2tp server?  Are you aware that it is three (well, since I write on Habr√©, 2 times) harder than PPTP?  And not every admin will be happy ... In general, I also had to bring up the l2tp protocol, the business case .. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  <strong>3.</strong> Lotus Notes from IBM (not from Vasya and Co. from Apple Store or Ali from Playmarket, but from mastadon) does not work on Mac OS Sierra.  No version.  Neither the old (8th) nor the last (9th).  It works everywhere: in Windows, in old versions of Mac OS X, in Linux, everywhere, and in the last (penultimate?) OS from Apple, on a computer over 100 thousand - no.  But we have Lotus - corporate standard.  In general, three days of life in total (unpacking the package, editing bash installation scripts).  In the end - you will laugh, raised through the "non-emulator" wine windows version of Lotus.  On Mac OS Sierra!  Windows Lotus version!  Masterpiece.  By the way, the last Lotus is all written in Java!  The one that works (as it were) everywhere.  Fantasy.  What was there to break? </p><br><p>  <strong>4.</strong> Remember the famous charging wire on the magnet?  It is not in the latest MacBook Pro!  Now, like everyone else.  I stuck deeper, someone hit the wire, threw the laptop on the floor or tore the plug out of the socket ... Progress!  (Oh, yes - do not touch the wires! Well, well) </p><br><p>  <strong>5.</strong> And the last.  There were a lot of small jokes with Mac, but I did not understand this one.  I sit, raise the Canon printer, which by the way also works on all OS, just not here.  Suddenly, the sound began to increase and decrease gradually with the output of the sound icon on the screen.  Well, as if he had healed his life: it goes out, then goes out.  I have not seen this even on netbooks from Acer ... </p><br><p>  It may seem to someone that he is writing a disgruntled Hayter Apple, a Win or Lin user.  Yes, I‚Äôm writing here from an old iMac, running OS X Mountain Lion ‚Äî and I think this bundle is almost perfect (only Linux is better!).  This is all (and iMac and OS) from Steve Jobs, released during his lifetime.  And this all works like a clock.  The only thing that changed the disk on the SSD.  My experience working on Macs in parallel with Linux is more than 12 years.  In general, 10 years, they did not fail ... The first doubts began with the latest Air and Sierra on it.  And suddenly this ... </p><br><p>  <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Nothing lasts forever.  The second conclusion is the main people, people.  Not companies, not brands.  Was Steve, Steve is gone.  And who is running the ball there now?  And what happens?  So that. </p><br><p>  UPD: <br>  The publication was hot and collected a lot of comments and reposts.  Suddenly.  I did not even try to embellish it somehow, I wrote in haste and in essence.  I attribute this not to myself, but to the topic that I raised.  Many say that I was, to put it mildly, not ready for a collision with Apple, that I am a bad admin.  It's like that.  And bad, and not ready.  As I wrote, 12 years on the Mac since the time of Steve Jobs is relaxing, we must constantly face difficulties in order to grow.  Axiom.  But I have a question for Apple - how do users cope with all these new jokes?  Now, in fact, for those who will read this text a little after its publication. </p><br><ol><li><p>  The fact that files can be transferred via Airdrop is fair.  It is unfair if your second comp is not Mac, or if it is Mac 10.6 or 10.8 (I have these, along with Linux). </p><br></li><li><p>  Much more fair was the indication of the ability to use the built-in samba server and share folders via smb.  I somehow forgot that it is, although I used to use it often.  Transition from Mac to Linux, the presence of NAS-s all there and the archaic habit of flash drives. </p><br></li><li><p>  Also, it turns out that pptp was cut out only for users (dummies, children and women).  For real specialists, the protocol remained and is fine tuned through an Apple Configurator.  What I did not know, I haven‚Äôt yet looked, but they say that openVPN is configured through it.  Keep in mind. </p><br></li><li><p>  The touchpad is strange.  Maybe it is configured, but on another computer I do not want to touch it.  I didn‚Äôt get a file or folder and transfer it to the Desktop without pressing additional keys on the keyboard.  Strange. </p><br></li><li>  I wrote that I watched a glitch with an independent life of sound without human intervention.  And this MacBook, as it turned out, sometimes falls off the keyboard: just one key is not pressed for some time.  The owner speaks from the purchase itself, which means it is not a third-party software, but a bug or hardware.  Sadly </li></ol><br><p>  In conclusion, I want to say thanks for the + and -.  For criticism and different words and debriefing.  All the same - all this for the benefit of readers.  Admin </p></div>
