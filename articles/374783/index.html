I contacted the guys from PrintBox3D, dropped a model on the printout, which they promised to print to me on 3DExpo.  When I went to pick up, I hooked the camera with me.  As a result, he asked for the production to see what was happening. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e7c/d22/266/e7cd222667df4578b4c293140e7b41ee.JPG"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  PrintBox3D 120 attracted my attention with its unusual look.  Some printers just left the assembly line and pass the test runs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a9d/36c/7b9/a9d36c7b93224f0c9f2a8a8b532d37b9.jpg">

      Now he is driven before launch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a2f/9ff/a7a/a2f9ffa7a0654dc39dc01f2001f85f42.JPG"><br><br>  Tests are extremely diverse, they print at different speeds minimum and maximum models. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2f1/169/183/2f11691835f94fb8b9689a761ef65acf.JPG"><br><br>  The machine copes normally, there are errors, but, in my opinion, they are insignificant. <br><br>  If the previous PrintBox3D One model looks like a CNC machine: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/871/252/6c7/8712526c772d4ad08cc23d87c5511d5a.JPG"><br><br>  That PrintBox3D 120 - the same machine, only in the shell of a personal printer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e4a/c55/176/e4ac55176c3348f1afd3f3880fdd633a.JPG"><br><br>  The first thing that catches your eye is the design of the device: rounded corners, white matte walls, a transparent protective screen (by the way, you can choose the color yourself, the manufacturer offers five colors to choose from).  Typical apple design. <br>  Thanks to the backlight printer glows from all sides in different shades.  Initially, the backlight is used to illuminate the printed model, and the design component is a side effect.  The on / off button for the backlight was made by the manufacturer separately on the back of the printer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/346/27c/49c/34627c49cd2048f28550103b5f030d3f.JPG"><br><br>  Unlike its predecessor, PrintBox3D 120 has the function of printing from external media. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1b1/2b6/e93/1b12b6e9309b42bfb72b7a6f9be2cdcc.JPG"><br><br>  For obvious reasons, all the secrets of the printer mechanics have not revealed to me.  "It's not possible now.  Then you will find out, ‚Äùit was told to me. <br><br>  So far, all that is known: <br>  - Separately made motor on the X axis, which actually makes it movable; <br>  - ‚ÄúClockwork‚Äù gear used when supplying plastic; <br>  - Maximum print resolution: 100 microns; <br>  - Maximum printing speed: 25 cm / h; <br>  - Device dimensions: 285x325x335 mm; <br>  -Printing area: 120x120x120 mm; <br>  - The starting price will be 99 000 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1db/552/b12/1db552b122aa41b199c84563123ad588.JPG"><br><br>  What else is typical: from its predecessor remained strong double aluminum frame.  It is also worth noting that in this printer one motor is used to move the extruder along the X and Y axes.  This is due to the selection of the scheme of fastening belts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c01/4f2/4a2/c014f24a2c0140c0b9a0e7b26e8b5293.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b2c/8e3/c73/b2c8e3c7368c47ed99922b37475f96fc.JPG"><br><br>  The extruder has also changed.  It uses a clock mechanism (planetary metal gears), this is done to enhance the reduction.  The system of building gears is not new, but interesting: a sun gear, satellites, a carrier, and, of course, a ring gear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb7/fd0/7e9/eb7fd07e964f4803a6759fadf3fcdc82.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/13f/12a/2cf/13f12a2cff5e48629171a7822e15c00f.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/52f/438/cbc/52f438cbc2e9484680a30dd7ce29fade.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, there is nothing ideal in our world, the table is calibrated with four screws, the process seemed to me personally laborious.  But a glass table will also appear, which will greatly facilitate this process.  Because the glass is initially smoother than any metal.  The printer makes an incomprehensible noise, which is caused by a high retraction speed.  Noise can be "screwed" by reducing the retraction rate. <br><br>  If you need to print with a raised glass, up to a certain point it is possible.  During printing, the extruder rises, as a result of which the plastic supply tube rests against the glass and it falls. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/61a/c5c/dde/61ac5cddee4b476bae3cca63d250db8e.JPG"><br><br>  If you need to print with a raised glass, then just remove it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a8b/195/43d/a8b19543dec446a59d34730112ebe264.JPG"><br><br><h4>  Summing up </h4><br>  For a personal printer, the machine is not bad.  It prints quality, there are errors when printing at high speed, but, in my opinion, they are insignificant.  Again, this depends on the printer setup, both at the software level and at the table calibration level.  Therefore, if you really understand, you will succeed with print quality. <br><br>  Protective case: children will not poke fingers, the cat will not accidentally fly into the printer, respectively, when printing with ABS plastic, you can not worry about the external factors affecting the printing of the model.  Thanks to the backlight, you can clearly see what happens when you print. <br><br>  Disadvantages: the printer produces an incomprehensible noise when printing, but over time you get used to it and stop paying attention.  The Arduino control board is still used, but for the next printer the guys promise their own development. <br><br>  Calibrating the table is also a time consuming process.  It is adjusted by tightening the four screws at the corners of the table, but there is glass on the table, which greatly simplifies the process.  Table for printing is too small, only 120x120x120mm.  With the lid open you will not patronize.  If there is a need, just remove it, it is not difficult.  And at the end of the "apple" design is not original, but it looks good. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374783/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374783/</a></p>
