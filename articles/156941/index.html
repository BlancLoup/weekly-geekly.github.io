  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Microsoft: Windows Phone 8 as Xbox, and Windows 8 will be the catalyst</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Microsoft is especially optimistic about its future in the smartphone market.  This optimism is due to the launch of the Windows Phone 8 operating system. The company even dared to speak out loud about its dysfunctional condition, stating that it is firmly on familiar ground and directly compares the launch of WP8 with the launch of the Xbox on the market seized by PlayStation and Nintendo. <br><br>  At yesterday‚Äôs press conference in the UK, Brett Siddons, head of marketing for Microsoft at the country, said that turning Windows Phone from a third-rate operating system into a serious competitor in the smartphone world can no longer be called Sisyphean because  the company has already ceased to be a newcomer in this field and knows from previous experience how to win. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/752/214/209/75221420915a92d716ef4359657fe8bf.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a>

      Former Xbox Group Marketing Manager - Siddons - has just taken the position of Head of Consumer Marketing at Windows Phone in the UK. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn the case of the Xbox, we had two unchanged rivals - PlayStation and Nintendo,‚Äù says Siddons.  ‚ÄúEveryone told us: you came to this market too late.  Despite this, we were able to evaluate traditional technologies and present something original with the Xbox.  Without a doubt, today we occupy a leading position in the market. " <br><br>  In addition, Siddons notes that Windows Phone 8 has received all the benefits of a late exit and is going to conquer two peaks - Android and iOS.  ‚ÄúI really believe in Windows Phone ... I feel that the time has come to open something fundamentally new to the market.‚Äù <br><br>  Siddons ignores the fact that WP8 is not such a new product.  In 2010, the launch of Windows Phone 7, which immediately turned into the same Sisyphus stone.  Now the company is again trying to raise it to the mountain (the so-called restart start). <br><br>  Closing his eyes to the whole story, Siddons is crucified about the advantages that, according to the Redmond company, their product has: <br><br>  ‚ÄúOver the past five years, smartphones, in fact, have not changed.  Rather, on the contrary, with the increase in the number of applications, the smartphone has become even more difficult to handle with the device, if we talk about an ordinary user.  In essence, we force the consumer to spend time searching for information from various sources.  It is here that, in our opinion, lies the main advantage of Windows Phone - when the phone is working for the user to provide him with really necessary and individualized information, and not vice versa. ‚Äù <br><br>  Again, we have already seen how WP is different from Android and iOS.  This did not help WP7, so why should this ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù ultimately help to ‚Äúset a stone on the top of a mountain‚Äù? <br><br>  This time, the main difference is the simultaneous launch of Windows 8, which not only looks and works like Windows Phone, but is also unified with it, and also built on the same core and is fully interoperable.  This key distinction introduces the user to the Windows Phone UI already through applications and services for Windows desktop, preparing the ground for their purchase. <br><br>  As Ovum analyst Nick Dillon said, Microsoft now has one trump card that might help attract mobile operators and which WP7 didn‚Äôt have.  System unification should make WP8 sales go uphill. <br><br>  Microsoft UK Marketing Director also stressed: ‚ÄúWith the launch of Windows 8 for the first time, the interface and startup screen that you had on Windows Phone will also be presented on millions of other devices.  In this way, people will be able to get acquainted with the system in a shorter period of time.  This should be a real catalyst. ‚Äù <br><br>  Millions of Windows users working on the interfaces of Windows Phone - nothing could be better and couldn‚Äôt have been thought of to get the sales of smartphones off the ground. <br><br>  No wonder that Ballmer triumphs. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/156941/">https://habr.com/ru/post/156941/</a></p>
