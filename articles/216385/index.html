Based on the typology, it can be useful to the novice Game Masteram and to all who are interested in psychology. </h1><br>  The problem of character generation for both desktop and computer games is simple.  There are many characters, and there is often no time or desire to develop them in detail.  In addition, in computer games, the implementation of complex characters most often occurs through the texts, and the texts, as you know, no one reads.  In the end, this translates into two or three main, more or less developed characters, a dozen sample and the rest of the faceless crowd, which, you see, does not please the players.  Accordingly, we need a system that would allow us to quickly and efficiently generate simple but interesting types. <br><br>  A typology can help solve this problem - a science that studies the characters of people by deducing their basic types.  It allows, including programmatic methods, to quickly build a realistic and holistic personality.  In view of the fact that in this article the topic of the character‚Äôs basis is only raised, I used only the most necessary classifications of the typology, and some remained outside the article. <br><a name="habracut"></a>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      So, let's begin.  The text will be a bit much, but the implementation itself is really minimal and does not require effort. <br><br>  <b>Step one.</b>  We determine the character's profession.  This could be a merchant, a blacksmith, a bard, the head of a house of contempt, a local prince, and so on.  Choosing a profession in the first step will help us build a more logical and realistic model of behavior of our NPC or will show problem areas that require additional justification. <br><br>  <b>Step two</b> - introversion or extraversion. <br>  An extrovert is a person, or a creature, oriented to the society.  He likes noise, activity, the crowd.  He is confident in himself and feels comfortable surrounded by people.  In practical terms, this means an extrovert will try to take a leading position in the dialogue, to propose or even impose their own thoughts and ideas.  The manner of conversation of an extrovert can be any, but more often extroverts will conduct a dialogue confidently and persistently.  Of course, if there is no stronger person from the other side.  In actions, extroversion also implies active actions and perseverance.  The extrovert conductor will rush the party, the extrovert tenant control the plans and procurement of equipment.  Of course, we should not forget that extraversion, like any other described below feature, has its strength.  To a ‚Äúweak‚Äù extrovert, it will be quite enough just to be in a crowd, but a strong one will want to control it. <br>  Introvert is a person focused on himself.  He likes silence, peace, loneliness.  He is not very confident, he needs a break from people.  Introverts are characterized by more restrained behavior in the dialogue.  Most likely, he will easily pass on the leading role to the interlocutor, forcing him to take the initiative in his hands.  In a conversation, an introvert will avoid conflicts, information will have to be obtained by questioning.  Introverts are more characteristic of restraint, politeness, uncertainty.  They will rather ask or even keep silent.  Annoyed, introverts lock themselves in and rarely show aggression.  Introvert conductor will not interfere in the activities of the party and will be kept at a distance, both morally and physically.  Introvert tenant is likely to give instructions and will do his own thing.  Having determined only this, we already get quite a lot of information about his personality. <br><br>  <b>The third step.</b>  In addition to introversion and extraversion, typologies are used to divide groups into Thinking and Feeling. <br>  Thinking is the type of people who put the need at the forefront.  The treatment is somewhat arbitrary, but to create a character is quite suitable.  For the thinking type of characters is characterized by independence from the opinions of others, calculation, straightforwardness, argumentation.  This type of calmly goes to unpopular decisions only because, in his opinion, they are necessary.  Thinking people most often include people of military professions, surgeons, etc.  The thinking guide will not be confused in case of danger, but if he has to throw a stuck party member, in order to save the rest of the group he will do it without moral agony.  For him, this is normal.  In turn, the Thinking employer will substitute the party under the attackers so that his native village could escape. <br><br>  Those who belong to the type of Sensors, put the attitude of other people at the forefront.  The feeling type is characterized by putting itself in the place of others, taking into account the opinion of strangers, taking into account the interests of others.  Politicians should relate to the feeling type, but for now such can be found only in good fairy tales and not often.  By the way, evil characters are extremely rarely Sensitive.  The feeling conductor will surely take care of the party with increased attention, and will give the last sips of water to children or women.  However, the Feeling Guides is a rather rare combination, since the work requires a fair amount of independence and rigidity.  The feeling employer will also take care of the party, which, incidentally, does not mean that he will not bargain for remuneration.  A bright example is Alhen the blue thief from ‚Äú12 Chairs‚Äù.  He was stealing and he was ashamed ... But he could not steal. <br><br>  <b>Step Four.</b>  The foundation is laid.  Now we need to revive the character.  We must identify the motives and motivations that move our character.  In other words, we need to know what he wants.  Could it be a thirst for glory?  Or making money?  Or peace throughout the world and that no one would leave hurt?  This is the question, answering which we will take our fourth step, already outside the typology.  In fact, the list is very wide and it makes no sense to organize it.  The principle itself is important for us - we must determine what drives our character.  Actually this will determine his actions and actions. <br><br>  <b>And finally, the fifth and final step.</b>  We must highlight the individual traits of our NPC.  Such features most often become pronounced (or important for the quest) personality traits.  A character can be a coward, storyteller, war hero, schizophrenic, fan of conspiracy theories.  Having finished with individual features, we get a quite good basic description of the nature of the NPC.  It can be used for passing characters or to develop further for key or more or less important ones. <br>  <b>And this is how it works:</b> <br><br>  Andrew.  The merchant, a pronounced extrovert, who thinks, craves power, but is poor. <br>  Alexey.  An explorer, an extrovert, who feels no specific goals, likes to drink. <br><br>  <i>Merchant Andrew.</i>  <i>Very active, expressive man trying to trade everything.</i>  <i>In a conversation he strongly emphasizes his acquaintances among the local elite.</i>  <i>He regularly offers some projects, ideas in which he is the main one.</i>  <i>Coward.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Explorer Alex.</i>  <i>Not married, spends evenings in bars, known as his boyfriend.</i>  <i>In dialogue likes to speculate, show himself an experienced specialist.</i>  <i>She adores giving directions, however, without arrogance or swagger.</i>  <i>Constantly takes a lot more supplies than you need.</i>  <i>Important!</i>  <i>In a critical situation will sacrifice themselves.</i> <br><br>  Everything.  Simple and quite useful characters at your disposal.  With a small workout, creating one character takes 3-5 minutes.  Of course, their characters are not deep at all, but they are brought into a single system, have a clear and understandable basis and can be developed to any level of detail. <br><br>  Afterword.  In total, the typology distinguishes 4 pairs of character traits.  In addition to those of which I have already said, Rationalists / Irrationals, Sensors and Intuits are also distinguished.  Together, this amounts to 16 different types that describe the person‚Äôs character fairly well.  More can be read in the relevant literature. <br>  <b>With all due respect,</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/216385/">https://habr.com/ru/post/216385/</a></p>
