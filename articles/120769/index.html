  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Don't get lost</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Each of us was at least once lost in an unfamiliar area, be it a forest or a city.  There are lucky ones who easily find a way out of this situation, but often there are also people who can hardly find their way to their own kitchen.  People usually call this topographical cretinism.  I am already silent about the mushroom pickers and hunters who, in search of their prey, go deep into the forest, and then they are looking for a way out of it for a long time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/0a7c5fb8/23f3ad25/19df087c/34b73a4b.jpg"><br><br>  But, as M√ºnghausen used to say: ‚ÄúThere is a way out of any situation.‚Äù  You can come up with an interesting solution for the situation described above.  One of the acceptable solutions is to use a device that will help to navigate the inhabitants of the planet Earth in any region.  The gadget in question is called ‚ÄúRecover Active‚Äù, and quite recently it came into my hands.  In general, the cases of application of this gadget are great.  But its main function is to return the person to the place from which he began his journey.  This is the so-called digital guiding thread of Ariadne.  Or if someone likes Russian folklore more, digital tangle. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The device with the code name "Returning Activ" (it is supplied by MasterKit, some devices of this company <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/99179/">have already been described</a> on Habr√©) is similar to the device from the James Bond films.  The screen, a few buttons, communication with satellites - all this is unusual.  But let's take a closer look at the mysterious box. 
      <br>

      <br>
    <h5>  TTX </h5><br>  ‚óè Device size: 7 √ó 3.3 √ó 1.2 cm. <br>  ‚óè Display size: 3 √ó 3 cm. <br>  ‚óè Weight: 130 g <br>  ‚óè USB charging time: 2 hours. <br>  ‚óè Operating time: up to 6 h. <br>  ‚óè Allows you to change the display backlight time (including always on or always off) <br>  ‚óè Allows you to select a measurement system from metric and English. <br><br><h5>  Design </h5><br>  Tiny black and white device.  Made of a rather pleasant plastic to the touch, it does not slip out of the hands.  The backlit square screen is slightly recessed into the case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/48c5be36/2ee0afbb/1282ed50/c2b14e3c.jpg"><br><br>  On the right side there are 4 buttons: up, down, Ok, Back.  On the left there is only one button - On / Off. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/0e22129b/123472be/4c2a18b1/e0f819f9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/9c3f78bd/4a4cf1e4/3fe095e7/754e1359.jpg"><br><br>  On the bottom panel, the mini USB input is conveniently located in the middle for charging the ‚ÄúPower Booster‚Äù.  And on the lower left corner - mount for the rope to put on your hand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/507416c1/87f1a604/8f659bf9/3e8b8c97.jpg"><br><br>  There is nothing special in the appearance of the device, no ryushechek, and, so to speak, strazikov ... So even better.  Simplicity is great. <br><br>  The back cover is attached with one screw.  Under it is the battery, which takes about 1/3 of the entire device.  It lasts for 5-6 hours of work.  If the screen is periodically turned off and does not use the backlight, then the work time can be stretched for a day or two.  And for the battery is already on the chip, we will not delve into its details.  There are experts who put Linux there, I have no doubt.  =) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/0647a492/7c453f8f/a822495e/9249bba1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/f303e039/33e81865/d49dad86/25786d40.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Functional </h5><br>  In this small box many functions are hidden, besides the most important one. <br>  There is also a stopwatch <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/6f1472ec/6e2f113f/d00066cd/61a18fa5.jpg"><br><br>  And the odometer speedometer (measures speed and distance). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/2f297b9b/ce7fe3fb/814d0d37/3e5b78a6.jpg"><br><br>  Even a pedometer (I never understood how they work) and a calorie counter.  There is a fun feature ‚ÄúWhere am I?‚Äù.  No, unfortunately, after the corporate party, she will not tell you where you are and how to get to the house.  But coordinates in space will show.  The main thing - do not call them a taxi driver. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/e5a3c05c/a8afd62b/3e9d737b/4356680d.jpg"><br><br>  There is still a clock and a compass.  The clock is updated according to GPS satellites. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/f2262ed5/e8951501/47c98154/01994a46.jpg"><br><br>  And of course, the most important function is to memorize the route of the path in order to bring you back the same way back to the starting point.  Or the shortest way, depending on what you need more <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/4abafb14/b11f8868/b16c9430/7e4cd740.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, it‚Äôs scary to see on the screen such an inscription on the way <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/586814fd/9bcd0234/7ec0129c/4358aff8.jpg"><br><br>  It‚Äôs good that it gave me so only in 4 brick walls, and I catch everything well in the air. <br><br><h5>  Tests </h5><br>  To try the device, I had to go to an unfamiliar city, go to the forest and take a walk around the field.  The latter probably looks like treasure hunt, because  the person simply walks from one point to another and looks at some small screen.  In the city, the returneer performed well, sometimes, however, communication was lost, but the maximum was for 10 seconds.  Bad that they are almost impossible to use behind the wheel.  First, when turning, you have to not hold the steering wheel, but press the button.  And secondly, the device can not be fixed in the car.  So, it is necessary to carry the navigator with you.  But it is not for this that he was made.  Navigation solutions for cars a lot, but here is a completely different goal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/bfe27a72/1ba82c01/67c4a68d/5545658d.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, smart people suggested that with such a thing you can even sail to sail in the sea.  You certainly will not be lost and you can get to the shore.  But, unfortunately, due to the circumstances of remoteness of Moscow from the seas and oceans, I cannot test the device on the water. <br><br>  It would seem that now there is Google.Maps and Yandex.Maps.  Why do we need some incomprehensible device, which is a pitiful similarity of the products of the two search giants.  Personally, I use Google Navigator in the city and, in principle, I do not need a ‚ÄúGPS-return‚Äù.  So I thought, until I ended up in the forest with a phone and this device.  To begin with, the communicator hardly caught the network and began downloading maps in order to understand where we are at all.  After 15 minutes, I still managed to figure out my approximate location in the forest and in which direction the city is located.  But how to go, on what paths, it was absolutely not clear.  The returnee in my footsteps brought me back to the entrance to the forest, and as I found out later, this device could lead me to the starting point in a straight line, the shortest way ... And also, the minus of mobile maps is that they are not in all cities and villages .  And GPS satellites fly around our globe. <br><br>  Device cost: ~ 2200 rubles.  Not much and not enough for a device of this kind. <br><br><h6>  Virtues </h6><br>  ‚óè Stopwatch <br>  ‚óè 12 routes, each with up to 500 points <br>  ‚óè Displays geographic coordinates <br>  ‚óè Digital compass <br>  ‚óè Shows date and time, rearranges time zones. <br>  ‚óè Measures movement speed and distance. <br>  ‚óè Multifunctional pedometer <br><br><h6>  disadvantages </h6><br>  ‚óè Lack of fastening for the car and bicycle <br>  ‚óè No battery replacement <br><br><h5>  Total </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/d0e06fc6/4cbf3440/ec5b9604/f06c8e20.jpg"><br><br>  The Returner will come in handy on any journey, be it a walking tour or a car ride through the city.  This device is able to replace the clock, stopwatch, speedometer, pedometer, navigator and compass.  With the exception of small flaws, you can safely give him a rating of 4+.  He copes with his tasks, I did not get lost and was able to get home. <br><br>  In general, this is just one of the gadgets that surprised me at <a href="http://gadgets.masterkit.ru/%3Fid%3Dhabr-3032">http://gadgets.masterkit.ru</a> and I could not resist, got a "Returner" and wrote this review.  And as a result of communication with the company, they had the idea to give gadzhedy habrlyudu on display, if you want - try.  You can contact through their <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/masterkit/blog/">blog on Habr√©</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120769/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120769/</a></p>
