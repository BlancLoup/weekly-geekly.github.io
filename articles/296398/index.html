We know a lot about her products, about the business twists and turns associated with it.  But we know practically nothing about what is happening inside the corporation.  How does it feel to work for Apple? <br><br>  Business Insider <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-employees-internal-corporate-culture-2013-10">collected</a> statements of former and current employees of the company. <br><br><h4>  Apple knows what you are talking about with your spouse </h4><br>  Ex-interface designer Justin Maxwell said that Apple‚Äôs security policy is very strict.  In an attempt to reliably protect its intellectual property, the company controls blogs, employee correspondence, and even conversations with loved ones.  Moreover, Apple experts specifically change the grammar and punctuation in the company's internal documents in order to track information ‚Äúleaks‚Äù. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Justin admits that if he had worked at Apple so far, he would not have been able to discuss this topic, but he would not have worried because there is no such possibility.  Justin likes the atmosphere of secrecy, when each employee is given the minimum necessary information.  Therefore, to the last he does not know what exactly he is working on. <br><br>  ‚ÄúFrom my point of view, it‚Äôs hard to work with this level of secrecy.  I can not even afford to joke with colleagues - I'm afraid to let slip, ‚Äùcomplains Simon Woodside, head of development for Core OS.  I have to intimidate engineers, constantly warning about what will happen irreparable, if someone finds out what task I give them, he says. <br><br>  "They say that Intel is paranoid, but at Apple they are in arm's length," said Ariel Meislos, the former CEO of Apple bought Anobit. <br><br><h4>  Apple provides quality feedback from management. </h4><br>  Every week, top managers discuss all areas of business and the work of company employees.  Former Apple designer Andrew Borowski said this: ‚ÄúRegularly, they give you either a positive feedback, or ask you to stop doing all kinds of nonsense.‚Äù <br><br><h4>  Apple doesn‚Äôt waste time on "stupid" </h4><br>  UX designer Luis Abreu tried to get a job in a corporation.  He passed 3 audio interviews, 5 video interviews, traveled to Cupertino for 5 interviews and lunch, which took all day.  And after all this, Louis received an indifferent "no." <br><br>  And in one of the interviews he was told: ‚ÄúWe are not wasting time on thoughtless persons‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  Apple will even get you in the hospital </h4><br>  A former employee of the company, Ben Farrel, was hospitalized after being bitten by a mosquito.  Instead of offering help and words of support, they sent by mail an unfinished presentation with a note that it should be urgently ready.  Even on his wedding day, Ben was forced to send a report on the work. <br><br>  Former Internet technology director Don Melton also complains that employees are forced to discuss work issues on Sunday evening. <br><br><h4>  Apple is different </h4><br>  The opinion of another former employee of Apple, who wished to remain anonymous, is expressed in a short phrase: "Everything is terrible, but the food is tasty." <br><br>  A completely different picture is painted by Andrew Guan from Apple China: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what the corporate culture is in the US, but in China everything looks a little foolish: the manager is standing on the table and shouting:‚Äú Who are you ?! ‚Äù.  And all the employees raise their hands and shout back: "We are Apple!" <br><br><h4>  Apple without Steve Jobs </h4><br>  ‚ÄúIf you had a project in which Steve was not interested, his promotion could take months.  But if Steve wanted the project to be implemented, the first results on it could appear on the same day, ‚Äùsays Chad Little, the company's ex-designer. <br><br>  And now, according to an unknown ex-employee, Apple‚Äôs development strategy and key decisions are made by the marketing department. <br><br><h4>  Apple - the unity of opposites </h4><br>  On the one hand, the company actively promotes the slogan <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_Different">‚ÄúThink Different‚Äù</a> .  On the other hand, Apple has the strictest rules. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296398/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296398/</a></p>
