Apple is usually more than successfully coping with this, but the Koreans raised such a hyip for the first time, for which they have great editorial respect!  The fact that for a few months technomaniacs of the whole world were drooling is called the Galaxy S III - the new flagship smartphone Samsung, which, by its characteristics, tears up almost everything that exists on the market today. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ydksS06kYCk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhaia7xtqpk7TKQXn7iIAmBZflhxQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Design </h4><br>  It was rumored that the SGS-III case would be ceramic and would cure any wounds with one touch, but in the end we have the usual, albeit very suitable plastic.  After the Galaxy Nexus I personally am a little annoyed that the back cover is glossy, but on a white background the prints are not particularly noticeable.  I was asked on Twitter about scratch resistance, but unfortunately I only had a few hours of gadget, so there was no chance to scold him with the keys in my pocket, sorry :) I decided to scrape the backdrop with a coin: there seemed to be no trace left ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/404/e93/5c6/404e935c6b7f1c6f3a76b5df1bd27877.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The silver edging, unfortunately, is not made of metal, but it does not really affect the strength.  The smartphone is perfectly assembled: nothing dangles anywhere and does not creak. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6af/351/9a1/6af3519a17d963f081dc90c7d0260d5b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Samsung has managed to make this 4.8-inch shovel really comfortable.  Smart is thin (8.6 mm) and light (133 grams), i.e.  fits well in your pocket and sits well in your hand.  However, this gives a certain opposite effect: you subconsciously expect a sort of noble metallic gravity from the flagship, and the S III doesn‚Äôt feel like it.  What is in the hands of high-tech piece, you understand only with the mind. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b3d/49c/4fe/b3d49c4fee2a360673941449f177086b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The location of the controls is classic for Samsung: on the top there is an audio jack, an additional microphone and a back cover hook.  On the right - only the on / off button.  On the left - the volume control, combined into one small button.  Below is a micro USB socket and the main microphone.  Under the screen on the front panel is another hardware Home button, and a pair of touch: Menu and Back. <br><br><h4>  Display </h4><br>  The screen has a diagonal of 4.8 inches and a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels.  The matrix here is Super AMOLED, which makes the screen very bright and sharp.  Some colleagues even asked: Is this a sticker on the screen? <br><br>  However, there are those who find flaws in this matrix.  The fact is that PenTile is an array consisting of non-honest RGB pixels (red, blue and green subpixels in one cell).  Instead, the pixels are staggered, and several neighboring points use a common blue subpixel.  There are people who see this unusual lattice, and it annoys them.  And if you are one of them, the company has something to say about this.  According to Samsung marketing manager Philip Bern, the blue subpixels in the AMOLED matrices "die" faster than others, and if there are fewer of them in the new matrix, it will generally last longer.  Thus, the company takes care of that the buyer does not have to change this wonder-smart smartly to something else too quickly. <br><br><h4>  Iron </h4><br>  In order for this resolution to slow down, the hardware should be very cool.  And then Samsung rasstaralsya!  The S III is equipped with a quad-core Exynos processor with a clock frequency of up to 1,400 MHz, a gigabyte of RAM and from 16 to 64 gigs of main memory.  So far, we can only talk about the supply of 16-gigabyte models to the Russian market.  However, do not be upset because  The ‚Äútreshka‚Äù is also equipped with a micro-SD memory card slot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6fa/088/3a7/6fa0883a73460d8ff63ed8ed9a128980.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The Mali-400 chip is responsible for the graphics, which is clearly reflected in the tests.  The new stone is so fast that smart does in the tests of all competitors, but the graphics, however, remained at the level of Nexus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/878/e51/763/878e517637bca8a5625561d1a1715d4b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Camera </h4><br>  Another remarkable component is the camera.  8 megapixels, flash, autofocus and a bunch of modes, including continuous shooting and HDR.  In modern times it was possible to find fault: what, they say, have regretted 12 megapixels?  But ... Somehow I do not want at all, because  The photo module does its job on a solid top five.  Just look at the test shots. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ab9/036/2a5/ab90362a55fffbe176b30a3dc56a51af.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Standard mode is quite suitable for sunny weather. <br>  <a href="">Photo in full resolution.</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a9b/5fb/28e/a9b5fb28e5ab5d9e3901f320a302c075.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Photographing during movie recording is possible only in widescreen mode.

For example, an hour at the maximum brightness of the screen (it basically consumes energy) with Wi-Fi on, constant performance tests and other entertainment, the charge was consumed only by 10 percent.  This, of course, is far from a reliable indicator, but it still allows you to draw any conclusions. <br><br><h4>  Soft </h4><br>  However, the company did not focus on hardware, but on the software part.  For example, the Smart Stay feature is implemented here.  The smartphone using the front camera monitors the owner and keeps the brightness at the same level, while the view is directed to the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d94/92f/509/d9492f50920050bedac3aa90a9e66b34.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition, the analogue of Apple Siri is interesting.  Samsung has implemented the voice control function of the gadget based on the Wolfram Alpha service called S Voice.  He recognizes the voice quite well, and even when he ‚Äúdoes not hear well,‚Äù he interprets the general meaning of the phrase quite well.  But it all works very slowly.  In this sense, Apple has done Samsung. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/479/d6d/a77/479d6da7791db6f41a6e71dacde32985.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Samsung also entered into a contract with Dropbox and each user of the S III is given 50 gigabytes for free.  True, as is the case with the share of HTC - only for two years. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/73f/844/f05/73f844f05febd66ab2d7c85607e692de.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, the fourth Android itself, on which the handset works, is covered on top with a Touch Wiz shell, which everyone has long known.  At least, for the short time that I spent with the gadget, I did not notice any special differences from the old versions. <br><br><h4>  Competitor </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ef/281/aa6/3ef281aa66abcca9f02aeebf347f71d1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The first and main rival of SGS-III, which comes to mind, is HTC One X. Also the flagship, also plastic, is also white (although both models have other options: HTC has brown and Samsung has blue) is also quad-core .  Both smart work on the fourth Android ICS with branded shells.  In short, there are really a lot of similarities, right down to the starting price.  But at the same time, HTC can boast of a more ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù design (both the case and the interface), and Samsung clearly wins in power and the number of ‚Äúchips‚Äù.  Here it is closer to someone: just go, or so surely with checkered. <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  At the time of the official announcement, especially nervous comrades nearly showered their gadget with their hats.  Like, did not meet the expectations laid down ... But the same situation was with the iPhone 4s, but in the end, see how it is bought up.  Here is the same: it was not worth waiting for a spaceship instead of a smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a68/e39/ffe/a68e39ffe819338b62c1a3f41754a759.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In my opinion, the device turned out to be very powerful and at the same time balanced, with a bunch of small but pleasant pieces.  An official pre-order is already open for it at Euroset for the price of 29990. Knowing Samsung, I was waiting for a price tag of 35 kilorubles, and in my opinion, a completely sane decision came out! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/334/0ed/030/3340ed0306d36d5dd82ffd2f16db93e9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Specs </h4><br>  <b>OS:</b> Android 4.0.4 <br>  <b>Processor:</b> Samsung Exynos 4212 Quad, 1.4 GHz <br>  <b>Video:</b> Mali-400 <br>  <b>RAM:</b> 1 GB <br>  <b>Main memory:</b> 16-64 GB <br>  <b>Screen:</b> 4.8 ", Super AMOLED, 1280 x 720 <br>  <b>Communications:</b> 3G, Wi-Fi 802.11 a / b / g / n, Bluetooth 4.0, NFC, USB 2.0 <br>  <b>Connectors:</b> USB 2.0, 3.5mm audio jack <br>  <b>Cameras:</b> 8 megapixels, flash, autofocus + 1.9 megapixel for video calls <br>  <b>Navigation:</b> GPS, GPS, GLONASS <br>  <b>Battery:</b> 2100 mAh <br>  <b>Dimensions:</b> 136.6 x 70.6 x 8.6 mm <br>  <b>Weight:</b> 133 grams <br>  <b>Price:</b> 29990 (pre-order in Euroset) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143708/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143708/</a></p>
