  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Stable hosting - myth or reality?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many hosting providers that provide hosting services experience various problems with this type of service.  In most cases, this is either a ‚Äúlagging hosting‚Äù or a service that takes a lot of financial and labor resources, complex programs for monitoring consumption and constant conflicts with users that exceed limits.  But with the right approach, you can minimize these factors. <br><br>  In this article I will try to share my experience, first of all, with logistics, alas, sometimes completely absent, both for beginner hosters and for large hosting providers.  Probably, with this article I will improve the affairs of competitors, but the market is large, enough for everyone.  In the end, the most important goal of our work is not so much to make money, but to make at least some contribution to the development of the Internet as a whole, because hosting providers ‚Äúbuild‚Äù the Internet and this is a big responsibility. <br><br>  Perceive this publication as a guide to action, or not - you decide.  I will only talk about what approach we profess, a relatively small hosting provider who has actively begun to build up the client base in this segment of services lately, which is an indicator of the real effectiveness of the methodology.  Previously, we also sometimes had problems with stability or an expensive part, but now the hosting clients almost do not bother us, and we don‚Äôt have them :) For statistics - for 1000 hosting clients, now we have only 1 request to those.  support during the day on average and the reason is far from a technical problem on our side. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  No mega-servers for hosting </h4><br>  Even one client can call a simple or terrible server hosting.  No matter how you limit resources, optimize your server, no matter how powerful it is, sooner or later a client will get there, which will certainly cause a problem on the entire server, breaking all levels of your overload protection.  At first glance, powerful servers contribute to increased stability, but they lead to the need to place more clients on one server for their depreciation, which increases not only the risk of a problem, but also the number of complaints that are sent to your support if such a server is unavailable.  And as we know, the server can become unavailable not only because of overload. <br><br>  Conclusion - it is better to use several servers of lower performance, instead of one super-productive server.  Since it is: <br><br>  - more reliably (in case of a problem with iron or problems with load there will be problems on a much smaller part of your infrastructure, since the number of less productive units is more); <br>  - it is easier to find the source of the problem (not always advanced load monitoring systems clearly indicate the culprit, sometimes you have to search manually, which is easier to do on a less productive server, where there are fewer clients by definition); <br>  - fewer dissatisfied clients in case the server has fallen, fewer requests for support; <br>  - a lower probability of server overload due to the development of projects of current clients, the risk of the need to rotate accounts between servers is reduced (sometimes some client projects may increase resource consumption during their development several times, the number of such happy and successful clients on less productive servers will definitely be less than on one super-productive, and the dependence is non-linear in nature!). <br><br><h4>  The principle of forming hosting plans is identical to the principle of building a menu of a good restaurant. </h4><br>  In a good inexpensive restaurant you will never find a huge menu, the larger the variety - the more expensive it is to keep the food base, which must always be fresh and stored in proper conditions.  In addition, restaurant "unlimited" (buffets) - this is actually harmful, not useful.  Obviously contribute to the acquisition of excess weight, and the quality of the food itself is undoubtedly lower.  Sometimes cheaper and tastier you can eat by choosing a limited order.  Similarly in hosting.  Let's start from the basic principles: <br><br>  - there are no unlimited resources, except for traffic (everything should be limited except traffic, since ‚Äúunlimited traffic‚Äù is a concept that is very important in marketing because of the greatest clarity for users among other restrictions, users simply do not want to think about how many gigabyte per month consumes their site); <br>  - in fact, the traffic should not be explicitly limited, leave the path to retreat (all your remaining restrictions should impose an ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù limiter on the traffic, so that you do not have to worry that one user has blocked the entire channel of the server without violating the other limits , as when generating traffic consumes server resources); <br>  - minimalism in the variety of tariff plans (by reducing the number of possible options for tariff plans, it will be easier for you to distribute them between servers, the probability of the need to rotate clients from one server to another is minimum, and if possible the gap on the allowable resource consumption of the minimum and maximum tariff plans should not be very large). <br><br><h4>  Protection against unscrupulous customers </h4><br>  The most reliable deterrent for spammers and other unscrupulous customers who want to use your services is price.  This particular contingent is counting on ‚Äúspoiling‚Äù and leaving, since you will certainly block it.  Accordingly, such people are trying to pay as little as possible (or not to pay at all, but to ask for testing) and certainly do not expect long-term cooperation. <br><br>  Think about it ten times before hosting for a dollar.  You can earn a dollar, and get a hundred problems!  Inexpensive tariff plans can be, but not with a monthly payment, but with payment for a long time.  However, if you want to provide a stable service, and so that your customers are satisfied - there can be no tariffs per dollar in principle, then I will explain why. <br><br>  As for the test policy, there should be no tests.  Testing services are either spammers or other balloon lovers and brain lovers to eat free of charge, to conduct a test on your admins.  Appreciate your admins, protect them from these problems!  The cost of hosting in our time is at the level of a glass of beer, the user can easily find the money to pay for the service for a month.  He does not ask to test a beer in a pub! <br><br>  If the user expects long-term cooperation, then in exceptional cases, with proper justification of the need for testing, you can go to a meeting - to guarantee a moneyback if the service does not suit for well-argued reasons and within the allotted time, but not a free test. <br><br><h4>  Hosting should be inexpensive not at the expense of a low resource limit. </h4><br>  It so happened that beginners usually take the cheapest hosting option that is available without having knowledge of how much resources they really need.  This is the source of all problems!  Complaints begin that ‚ÄúI was transferred to a more expensive tariff, although there is no attendance on the site, the hoster wants to make more money‚Äù, which often happens when new users use heavy scripts such as WordPress, which, with the presence of plug-ins and due inexperience of the user, can create a significant load on the server, even with one visitor to the site.  In addition, by providing such tariffs, you simply begin to give your server resources if you do not take into account the load properly.  To avoid this, your minimum fare should include enough resources for both the business card site and a site with an audience of several thousand people per day! <br><br>  But how then to ensure a low cost of the minimum tariff, which is especially critical for a client with a business card site?  Everything is very simple!  Give the opportunity to get a good price for long-term payment, say when paying for a year, make a discount of 2 times, and when paying for a 3-month period, the price should be the same as when paying for 2 months if you pay for the service monthly.  This even encourages newbies to pay for services for at least 3 months and reduces the number of failures.  However, with the annual payment option, the price of the minimum tariff plan must be at least $ 4 / month.  Someone will say that this may be too expensive for a business card site, but the large number of included resources and the guarantee of stability of the service work flawlessly.  Besides, you are not tired of selling the service, which also includes the work of your admins, is cheaper than a pint of beer? <br><br>  Benefits: <br><br>  - You often receive funds immediately in a year; <br>  - fewer failures from hosting monthly, less forgetfulness of renewals; <br>  - higher income from the minimum tariff plans, as they are more expensive; <br>  - a larger reserve of resources on the server as a whole, due to the fact that not all users of the minimum tariff plans consume the limit assigned to them, which increases stability, reducing the likelihood of the server being overloaded with any process in a critical situation, since it will ultimately remain more free resources than was planned; <br>  - doubting customers, seeing the prospect of getting the service very cheap with a long payment period, to check whether the truth really works fine or not is paid initially for a month, as well as users who do not have the full amount to pay for initially for a long time when ordering but plan extend the service as soon as the money is collected. <br><br><h4>  No tariffs with an unlimited number of domains </h4><br>  The number of domains that can be placed on the account, you need to limit.  First of all, to encourage the user to switch to a more expensive tariff plan, which provides for the possibility of hosting more sites. <br><br>  But even the most expensive tariff plan should not allow adding domains unlimited. <br><br>  Because in the absence of restrictions on the number of domains: <br><br>  - more server resources are used, the probability of exceeding the load limit is greater; <br>  - there is no additional incentive to switch to a more expensive tariff, if the load is in the normal range; <br>  - Your customers will become portal builders and other fans of black SEO; <br>  - server configuration files clog up with slag records. <br><br><h4>  No more than 50 clients per server under any conditions </h4><br>  The cost of renting an average server performance, and in my understanding, this configuration is not lower than Intel Xeon E3-1230 / 8-16GB DDR3 / 2-4x1TB HDD, nowadays so low that it is possible to recoup the cost of depreciation more than 2 times by server up to 50 clients.  Of course, you need to stop earlier if the total load of all clients starts to reach 50% at peaks from the server, but so far I have not seen this :) At the same time, you also need to determine the maximum possible number of clients with a tariff plan above the minimum.  We, for example, have only 3 tariffs, while the maximum differs in resources by 5 times from the minimum.  Accordingly, among our 50 customers should not be more than 10 with the maximum tariff plan. <br><br>  If, as a result of placing 50 clients, even half of the server resources are not used, nothing terrible, no need to be greedy, the return on investment and the required level of income from the server are reached, oversell is evil.  It is better not to try to save money and fill the server to the maximum, but to install an additional server.  Especially with a large number of orders per day (more than 10) - it will be difficult to calculate the real load.  This will save you from unnecessary expenses for support, from the need to rotate clients between servers due to their development (upgrade of the tariff plan) and increase stability.  And most importantly, with a critical problem on the server, only 50 clients will experience inconvenience, and no more.  By the way, the advantages of the minimum number of clients on one server have already been mentioned above, so I will not repeat. <br><br><h4>  No individual tariff plans </h4><br>  Sometimes a user may ask to make an individual tariff - give more resources than the maximum tariff provides, for example, make 2 maximum tariff plans in one for the price of two.  You should not give in to this provocation.  Such a user is already initially focused on high consumption, and large consumers of resources consume at peaks and in critical cases many times more resources, the progression is far from arithmetic.  That is, if we designate the critical load created by the user of the maximum tariff plan as a unit, then the user with the above described individual tariff will most likely create a load not of 2, but at least 4 in the critical case. <br><br>  In addition, violating standardization is more difficult to plan the allocation of resources.  The probability of problems with a large consumer of resources is much greater than with a small one.  Such users can be ‚Äúddosit‚Äù and try to break, since they probably already have a large project with such consumption, the competition is higher.  Because you need to clearly understand that such clients have no place on the hosting, they can afford a dedicated server. <br><br>  Need more resources than the maximum rate?  Need unlimited domains, etc.?  Welcome to the dedicated server, but not to the hosting.  To risk the stable work of the remaining 49 people because of the prospect that one will pay more is stupid.  Let him pay more and take a dedicated server;) <br><br><h4>  No big databases and lovers of parsing on hosting </h4><br>  Unfortunately, the imagination of some webmasters has been so degraded lately that they don‚Äôt even bother to fill their own sites, but simply parse the content to their site from other sites, increasing the size of databases to a gigabyte or more, while the architecture of such a database is not quite perfect character.  When a table is beating in a large database or a bunch of processes are hanging, the server is unlikely to be good.  And slag sites are not at all the kind of Internet that I would like to see.  Create restrictions for lovers of slag sites - do not allow them to host, and users with bases of more than a gigabyte are better honestly and immediately denied service, unless there is complete certainty that the user will not kill the server and the SDL portal with optimized scripts. <br><br><h4>  Your server must be reliable and placed in a reliable Data Center, not in stock. </h4><br>  Yes, fans of cheap warehouses will forgive me, but now renting a server in a reliable Data Center with a real guaranteed channel without traffic restrictions costs less as a result than at low-cost airlines, where nothing is guaranteed at all.  Desktop iron does not apply here, unless you want to conduct those.  working on their servers several times a year, thereby creating inconvenience for their clients.  Well, iron, not designed for a constant server load, cannot work properly in such conditions. <br><br>  However, some low-cost posters now offer servers with 64 GB of RAM, even server configurations at first glance, and inexpensively.  The secret is that some of the components there are still dextronic and this is a self-collection, the server, perhaps, only the body.  Do not pursue cheapness and megapixes.  You don't need them either.  Do you know a lot of projects that consume 64 GB of RAM?  Most projects will actually have enough server with 4-8 GB of RAM with a head, there will even be a lot.  But why take it when you have 64 GB RAM for less money, many people think, this is not cool!  This is stupid marketing and nothing more than that, alas, works.  Even if the configuration is really server-side - everything else will be none.  In addition, there is a great chance to get on the imaginary "unlimited" in the form of a channel bandwidth to the server after exceeding a certain amount of traffic. <br><br>  The quality cannot be too cheap, it is better to take at first glance a less productive server for the same money, but in a good Data Center and eventually use its resources to the fullest, since there will be all the possibilities for this.  It is important reliability, efficiency of replacement (up to the whole server within an hour) and, of course, placement.  It should be a reliable platform with excellent connectivity and support, with an adequate abusive department that will not block your server on the first complaint from someone who is not clear, but will review it, analyze it and, if necessary, contact you and give you time to respond.  Loukosetry not able to maintain a staff of such employees, because they can send you absolutely all complaints, both confirmed and not confirmed, do not disdain your disabling.  They have enough customers without you and the stream of lovers of freebies is so great that it is easier for them to replace the client with a less problematic one than to deal with complaints. <br><br>  Complaints on hosting servers are frequent.  That is why it is not enough to rent a server in a reliable Data Center, it is necessary that the Data Center itself is in a country that is reliable under the law.  This will protect you from the removal of the brain by law enforcement agencies with or without, as the legislation of some countries is moronic, an example is the ban on the placement of sites for adults and the criminal prosecution of such webmasters, while in many countries it is absolutely legal.  It is also better not to be placed in those countries where laws do not always act, and your server can be withdrawn not only by a court decision, but simply at will as evidence or under some other pretext. <br><br><h4>  results </h4><br>  - real load on the hosting servers for the above configuration in the range of 20-30% with 50 clients on the server, a huge stock of resources, traffic consumption in the range of 5-25 Mbit / s; <br>  - for every 1000 clients there is an average of 1 request in those.  support per day; <br>  - servers are stable, client sites always work, problems are incredibly rare, the need to spend time on support is minimal; <br>  - exceeding the permissible load due to high limits - an extremely rare phenomenon and the transfer to a more expensive tariff plan does not cause a storm of emotions, because at the time of the excess, the webmaster already earns enough and is no longer a novice. <br><br>  It makes no sense to build cluster, cloud hosting, develop ultra-expensive solutions to monitor the load and metering of consumed resources.  Even cloud hosting falls, absolute stability is not possible, but it tends to be possible.  In this case, it is useful to apply the Occam's Razor principle to hosting: a diversified solution on non-congested servers will be much cheaper, more stable, easier to implement, the complexity of this scheme is not a way to stability, but to problems.  Sometimes the simplest solution is the most correct, do not complicate your life without emergency, I believe that it is better to adhere to this principle. <br><br>  Sergii V.
