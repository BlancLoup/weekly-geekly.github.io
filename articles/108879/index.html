  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review ECTACO jetBook mini, or ‚Äúare there normal readers for $ 100?‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Not in any way without encroaching on the laurels of the great and terrible <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/boomburum/" class="user_link">Boomburum</a> 'a decided to review a rather interesting exhibit - a reading room for $ 100 (it‚Äôs not all the time to translate a clever video ...). <br><br>  Moreover, the exhibit is really entertaining - in Russia you will not find such a thing yet (only <a href="http://perevodov.net/products/jetbook-mini-black/">pre-order</a> has been announced).  Interest was also caused by the fact that the device is made in retro style, which seems to be quite popular lately (for example, the same mobile phones that are only ... phones) - nothing except reading, this device is not able to - this is an incredible rarity now.  In addition, the device seems to be some interesting and unusual toy gadget (I would say, to an amateur). <br><br>  So, here it is JetBook Mini, welcome!

I came across this miracle from a friend of a friend, to whom it cost a little more than $ 100 (including all kinds of deliveries).  Many readers are approaching this amount, but the jetBook mini seems to be leading in terms of price. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/2b/a9/2ba90e267dbeea7bf0cc9375df53030e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, the box looks like something on the packaging of a toy, but all together it looks very cute, in the same retro style. <br><br>  Before starting my own short review, it would be logical to give a translation of the official product description from <a href="http://www.jetbook.net/">www.jetbook.net</a> : <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúThe days of the $ 99 eReader are finally here!</i>  <i>It is not always the case.</i>  <i>It is easy to use.</i>  <i>Our lighter and thinner design makes it easy to read.</i>  <i>If you‚Äôre on the screen, you‚Äôll see it like this.</i>  <i>With an SD card slot, you can expand your jetBook to up to 2GB of storage.</i>  <i>Check out some more specifics below! ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúThe times of $ 99 e-books are finally here!</i>  <i>JetBook mini is probably the cheapest reader in the world; moreover, it is the first reader that uses 4 AAA batteries, which last for years.</i>  <i>The process of adding books is very simple - just transfer the desired file from your computer to your device, and you're done!</i>  <i>This reader is bright and small in thickness, so you can easily read books almost anywhere.</i>  <i>Special LCD-screen allows you to read for hours, without feeling tired eyes.</i>  <i>(I don‚Äôt know what eInk is).</i>  <i>The reader supports SD memory cards, so you can expand disk space up to 2 GB!</i> <br><br>  <b>Main technical characteristics:</b> <br>  <i>Screen:</i> 5 inches, TFT LCD <br>  <i>Weight:</i> 0.16 kg <br>  <i>Power:</i> 4 AAA batteries.  90 hours of reading.  2 years standby <br>  <i>SD / HC memory card:</i> expandable up to 32 GB <br>  <i>Font size:</i> 16pt - 32pt <br>  <i>Supported formats:</i> LIT, MOBI, EPUB, HTML, PRC, RTF, PDB, PDF <br>  The ability to read from different angles <br>  Text alignment, spacing and line spacing are adjustable <br>  <i>Interface languages:</i> English, French, Italian, Portuguese, German, Spanish, Polish and Russian. <br><br>  So, we have a simple, uncomplicated reader with support for memory cards, push-button control of a 5-inch LCD screen that supports the main extensions for electronic books. <br><br>  Well, let's proceed to a more detailed study! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/be/eb/beeb006359ae7f5564ee55d9037f9b17.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As it should be, an accessible and understandable quick start guide goes to the reader, which describes the main functionality and control of the device.  According to him we insert batteries and turn on the reader! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/7c/f9/7cf950a84efcb2453fc5b6bd59d8dcb6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We see how almost instantly there were daddies and separate files.  The reader has five main buttons: ‚Äúup‚Äù, ‚Äúdown‚Äù, ‚Äúmenu‚Äù, ‚Äúinput‚Äù and ‚Äúexit‚Äù.  With the help of them all control is carried out. <br><br>  Let's try to open one of the texts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/02/42/0242d868aa199e1f8fd5c1502b4419a4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We see that the display quality is quite acceptable, it is convenient to read.  Plus, there are a number of functions for conveniently setting the type of text and reader for you: <br>  - change the hand (turn the text) <br>  - make a bookmark <br>  - move to other points <br>  - book options (fonts, spacing, etc.) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/e4/3d/e43dc65f131695d4ce19072e48e63727.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, now we will try to connect to the computer and fill in a couple of books! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/6b/81/6b8169de5f50600a10a10f7dc6e7d6cc.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As you can see, no special installers and unpackers!  The device was defined as an external medium - we simply copy the book to it in the required format, disconnect from the computer and go ahead - read-read-read! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/9e/a8/9ea8bedf7bd5b113a31f287aa2a4beda.png" alt="image"><br><br>  That's all - how simple the product is, so short is the review! <br><br>  <b>A little thought</b> <br><br>  What interests me in the first place is the fact who the company is targeting when launching such a device on the market.  It seems to me that these are children (the case is in fact durable, you can safely give to the torment) and representatives of the older generation (from the user's point of view, there is absolutely nothing difficult in the device).  Fans of high technology and multifunctional devices are unlikely to find the product attractive. <br><br>  From this follows the second question: can this product fill the market among the most important strata of the population, primarily in Russia?  It seems to me that the potential, in principle, is.  The comparison is, of course, very impudent, but if the company follows the path of Nokia, which at one time has earned itself a reputation as a manufacturer of ordinary, durable phones that are accessible to everyone, then why couldn‚Äôt ECTACO become reader manufacturers for everyone? <br><br>  Here one more question arises: does this product have everything necessary to become so massive? <br>  I identified several criteria for myself: 1. strength, 2. ease of handling, 3. charge duration, 4. price. <br><br>  I already wrote about strength - the device is not at all fragile, well-built (completely made of plastic, but does not hurt the eyes).  And he wrote about simplicity - there is simply nowhere to get lost in a very simple and basic menu.  The duration of the charge is a very big plus if it corresponds to the stated one (90 hours in the working mode, he did not conduct the test).  With the price you can work a little, I think.  In Russia, they promise to sell this reader for 3,990 rubles, while in the US it is sold for $ 100 (i.e., approx. 3,100 rubles).  I am almost sure of the mass character of the product, if the price is lowered to 3,000 rubles. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt know if the small jetBook mini will win the world or Russian market, but I like it.  I wish him success! :) <br><br>  Your opinions and comments are welcome! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108879/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108879/</a></p>
