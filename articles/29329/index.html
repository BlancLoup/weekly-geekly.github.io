  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Friday evening - people want to relax, but everyone is tired: I want to help (NOT an Internet startup)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So‚Ä¶ <br><br>  Today is Friday.  What are you going to do after work?  I asked myself this question a few months ago and realized that I did not find a suitable answer ... And the options were as follows: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  go to the country </li><li>  go to parents </li><li>  do household chores </li><li>  go to the bar </li><li>  go to the cinema </li><li>  go bowling (billiards, curling, etc.) </li><li>  play computer (console) </li><li>  invite friends </li><li>  read a book </li><li>  to sleep </li></ul><br>  And so, it would seem, there are so many alternatives, so many possibilities ... But not this: some options turned out to be boring, many demanded a lot of effort ... They stayed, as always - a bar, a bowling alley and a summer house (you want to relax with friends).  Naturally, no one ordered a bar and a bowling alley, and this ball already sits in the liver ... And it was 4 hours to go to the dacha for 4 hours, and the rains promised ... At the moment when I realized that I had money, time and desire, but There is no normal option for spending time, I was visited, in my opinion, a rather worthy idea: <br><br>  The idea is, as it was already possible to understand, in meeting the needs of people in leisure (recreation, fun'e, entertainment - as you like).  Today, almost everyone has heard of the <b>Nintendo Wii console</b> .  The meaning of my project in the commercial use of this console.  Those.  people come and play it, like bowling or billiards ... At the same time, you can play active (read - sports) games - tannis, boxes, etc .;  classic games of machine guns - shooting, racing, fishing ..;  long non-stressing - chess, card, etc ... You can play everything in a big company, and for freaks there are Zelds and other RPGs ...

      As a result, we get an almost universal product (service) that is not amenable to seasonality ... Especially in Moscow today it‚Äôs not at all possible to get into a ‚Äúclean‚Äù institution from Thursday to Monday ... And accommodation is planned precisely in Moscow - a priority in the center, but something like Sokolnikov or Frunze. <br><br>  <b>Few technical issues: it</b> is planned to install 7 boxes 3 * 4 meters, fully equipped for the game (projector, console, acoustics).  Secondary services are fairly standard: free Wi-Fi (all consoles are also connected to the Internet for online games and surfing), a bar, a restaurant. <br><br>  <b>Copyright and licensing.</b>  I don‚Äôt want to describe the whole procedure and processes of interaction with copyright holders, but this issue has been resolved. <br><br>  <b>Nintendo can be bought for 10 000 rubles and play at home.</b>  Yes, but the film can also be bought for 150 rubles and seen at home, but the cinemas are clogged ... And plus to everything, in 70% of the games, it makes sense in a team game or in competition with friends, and you don‚Äôt always want to call friends and have the opportunity.  The third point - the games are in stores for 2000r, and here you can play any and all with all the amenities and appropriate accessories.  The fee is taken for 1 hour of play.  Price varies depending on the day of the week and time of day. <br><br>  This business can be developed indefinitely - from opening a representative office in different cities of the Russian Federation to the creation of an international network of entertainment centers.  As for the moral and technical obsolescence of consoles and applications, then developers and developers come up with everything for us - new ideas and sub-products come themselves. <br><br>  <b>Who am I waiting for:</b> <br>  young parents with children from 3 to 9 years old (weekends 10-16 hours); <br>  students and schoolchildren aged 12-21 (weekdays 10-18 hours); <br>  active working people aged 20-35 years old (weekdays 18-22 hours); <br>  companies of friends and acquaintances of any age (weekend 18-02 hours) <br>  competitors and Nintendo game fans (event days); <br>  legal entities (corporate holidays); <br><br>  <b>What await at the exit:</b> <br>  People will have the opportunity to experience a new kind of entertainment;  gaming industry will receive a platform for championships and presentations;  I will get a financial result. <br><br>  Would you go to this kind of institution?  Are you ready to pay (the price per person is about 100-200 rubles per hour, prices for food and drinks are standard Moscow) for such a vacation?  What do you think about the idea as a whole, dear Habrokoobschestvo? <br><br>  <b>Update:</b> because  there are misunderstandings, then I clarify - ‚Äúthe price per person will be about 100-200 rubles per hour‚Äù takes into account the average number of 3-4 people (standard company of friends) in one ‚Äúbox‚Äù.  "Boxing" is designed for a maximum of 8-10 people. <br><br>  PS This is my first habratopic, please treat with understanding. <br>  PS I thought for a long time, take the topic to ‚ÄúStartups‚Äù or to ‚ÄúGames‚Äù ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29329/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29329/</a></p>
