Thanks to biometric verification, users have the ability to remotely use services that previously required a mandatory physical presence in order to verify their identity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aac/31e/a37/aac31ea37920c63cf5c8fa2a6610fc45.png"><br><br>  Biometric data for the system are registered in bank branches according to strict regulations.  In this post we will describe how we implemented the collection of biometrics in Promsvyazbank and try to dispel the myths associated with this process. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  While other industries were engaged in the implementation of biometrics at different levels, the banking sector could only experiment with her.  The legislation severely restricts banks in identifying the identity of an individual and the procedure for providing services.  In the meantime, banking cases of large vendors of biometric solutions started in the meantime.  The company Nuance, for example, has collected and successfully uses dozens of voice biometrics.

      The ice started when the federal project ‚ÄúDigital Economy‚Äù was launched in Russia.  On December 31, 2017, the President signed 482- ‚ÄúOn Amendments to Certain Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation‚Äù.  The first stage of the Digital Economy project was the creation of a national biometric platform ‚Äî the Unified Biometric System ‚Äî the state base of biometric templates of citizens of the Russian Federation.  At the same time, in order to develop the economy, the project ‚ÄúRemote identification of bank customers‚Äù was logically launched. <br>  We joined the project from the very beginning, at the level of the working group at the Ministry of Communications and the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.  So we got time not only to understand the process itself, but also to think well of our actions and the process of work on the implementation of the process.  In addition, using our knowledge, it was possible to influence the concept of the project, as well as the formation of requirements, which in the future this process will be presented to all banks. <br><br><h2>  How we collect biometrics </h2><br>  Assessing the documentation and comments of partners from Rostelecom, the Ministry of Communications and the Central Bank, we divided the service into four main parts. <br><br>  <i>ABS PSB-Retail</i> is a banking system for servicing individuals, which, among other things, stores personal (non-biometric) customer data.  For this project, we have refined it and integrated it with intrabank services and the biometric data registration portal. <br><br>  <i>The registration portal</i> is the main element of the system, which includes the automated workplace (automated workplace) of the service center operator.  We will tell about it in more detail. <br><br>  <i>The connector between the portal and the SMEV (interdepartmental electronic interaction system)</i> is a software product that generates requests and sends them to SMEV for processing by the public services of the ESIA and the EBS.  This part was made for us by an external vendor who has already created transport solutions for the bank, including on interaction with SMEV. <br><br>  <i>ESIA and EMU</i> - public services, Unified Identification and Authentication System, Unified Biometric System.  Created and maintained by Rostelecom.  According to them, we received all the documentation, descriptions, the bank interacts with them through SMEV. <br><br><h2>  AWP biometric registration </h2><br>  The data registration portal was fully developed on the bank side.  On the one hand, it should clearly interact with all parts of the system listed above, and the data acquisition hardware.  On the other hand, to ensure an adequate level of security for the processing of personal and biometric personal data and use the quality control library provided by Rostelecom to check samples. <br><br>  We decided not to use fat clients, but to create a web solution for easy deployment in the workplace, centralization of data storage and processing, and the possibility of flexible modification of the solution. <br><br>  Our product was named ARM PACK ‚ÄúRegistrar.  PSB-BIO ‚Äù- Automated Workstation of the Software and Hardware Complex‚Äú Registrar.  BIO "for Promsvyazbank.  Everything was clear with the hardware of the complex - it is necessary to comply with the requirements for the equipment (they are listed in this <a href="https://habr.com/company/rostelecom/blog/424751/">post</a> ).  And we have developed the software part ourselves.  We started with the elaboration of the functionality - the application should be able to: <br><br><ul><li>  receive data from a third-party application (in our case, it is ABS Bank); <br></li><li>  provide a convenient environment for registering biometrics - with prompts for the operator; <br></li><li>  automate the entire process of obtaining biometric samples; <br></li><li>  send data to form a request to the connector and receive a response via the banking data bus; <br></li><li>  take into account the security requirements in working with personal and biometric personal data; <br></li><li>  log the actions of the system, its users and the administrator; <br></li><li>  take into account the specific requirements for hardware and software. <br></li></ul><br>  The registration process originates in the bank's ABS, for which we wrote an API on the back-end to receive data from third-party systems.  After the ABS generates the client registration order, the portal URL is called up with the transfer of the required data. <br><br>  Now the operator workstation to begin the registration process.  He sees in the portal a client card with data that will be used in work with ESIA and EMU.  Here you can choose which client's address will be used when registering with the ESIA (registration or residence), as well as provide information for the delivery of a password (telephone or e-mail). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3d1/4fa/cc6/3d14facc6d0e7dc3809bb84458514984.png"><br><br>  Next, a request is automatically created to search for a client account in ESIA.  According to the search results, the service gives the possible use of the aircraft.  BC - type of information, a protocol for transmitting information of a certain type between the information systems of the supplier and the consumer.  If several accounts are detected and none have confirmed status, the operator chooses which one to work with. <br><br>  If the account provides for several types of information, the operator selects any of them under the control of an employee who has the authority of the central office controller.  So we reinsure ourselves from sending incorrect data and eliminate the possibility of fraud at this stage. <br><br>  After approval of the set of sent data, the operator sends a request to the ESIA on the selected type of information.  In response, SMEV confirms the sending of the request, and the operator receives the OID of the client's account in the ESIA. <br><br>  Now, upon receipt of the client's consent to register with the EBU, we begin to collect data. <br>  First, the operator sets the correct position of the camera relative to the client.  The workstation helps him, displaying a preview of the frame with marks of the location of the face (crosshairs), the angle of the head.  It also shows the numerical information: resolution, image size, angle of inclination of the head and the distance between the eyes.  Along with this there are tips for the operator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/98f/e90/27d/98fe9027d44f0f05f242733933f56001.png"><br><br>  After setting the camera position, the operator presses the start button of the shooting.  The service takes pictures, checks their compliance with the requirements of Rostelecom and displays information to the operator - whether or not the check passed, what the client needs to do (lower the chin, turn the head, etc.). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a04/cfc/a13/a04cfca13b15e678ee171ba3a88d3625.png"><br><br>  After completing this stage, AWP automatically goes on to record voice samples.  The client repeats a randomly generated sequence of numbers from 0 to 9 in three standard sequences three times.  After each entry, the quality control library checks it.  By the way, this library was developed by Promsvyazbank employees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/731/79c/496/73179c496d27b574d3ab112760792dd3.png"><br><br>  Then in the records the beginning and the end are put down, they are combined into one and sent to the EBU.  After passing the control at the central office controller, the biometric samples are transmitted to the connector to form and sign the package, transfer to the SMEV and further to the EBU. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5d4/088/204/5d408820427732ca789af9cc8cef824f.png"><br><br>  After receiving a response from the EBU, an end-of-registration card is displayed on the operator‚Äôs screen.  And according to the registration results, a message is received from the ESIA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fa5/b24/e87/fa5b24e8759733da9ce0b4b35375ce0b.png"><br><br>  This is how data is recorded in Promsvyazbank for the Unified Biometric System. <br><br><h2>  Common Misconceptions </h2><br>  We know that the new system is causing some people questions.  Let's comment on several popular ones: <br><br>  <b>"Banks will own my data and cheat."</b>  No, banks simply do not get access to the biometric data of customers and individuals.  Banks register an individual (customer in ESIA), send a photo and voice recording of proper quality to the EBU.  Fraud is impossible without biometric EMU templates that are not created on the bank side.  In the process of identification in the ESIA, banks do not participate, but only receive the final status of this identification. <br><br>  <b>"My data will be used by outsiders."</b>  We often hear remarks like ‚Äúanother will take credit for me‚Äù, ‚Äúa wife with my photo will have access to my accounts‚Äù.  Not.  The technology of biometrics provides for verification by the Liveness method - that is, it is verified that at the other end is a living person.  For this, the order of pronouncing phrases or numbers is unpredictable, and the movement of a person, mimicry, lip movement during face verification is evaluated.  Such multimodal biometric features increase the reliability of the method. <br><br>  <b>"We are being watched and therefore everyone is obliged to submit the data."</b>  No, the surrender of biometrics is an entirely voluntary matter.  Of course, over time, those who have accounts in ESIA and EBS will be able to receive more interesting offers and services and much faster.  But the decision on the delivery of biometrics remains always for the client. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/431396/">https://habr.com/ru/post/431396/</a></p>
