They don't let you get bored, but you feel safe when people live nearby.  And how many neighbors on your server in the data center where you are hosted?  And here the situation is exactly the opposite: the more projects spin on one piece of iron, the more threats to each of them.  However, increasing the density to the detriment of security has long been the norm for modern data centers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba2/822/f64/ba2822f64591b37d2e89e92dd7a597d1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Before, every child knew that they should not keep all their eggs in one korzinka</i> <br><br>  Presented on September 21 at CryptoBazar in Moscow, the project of the distributed data center <a href="http://eggsdc.com/">Eggs Datacenter</a> is going to change the status quo in the market of traditional data centers using Emercoin technologies. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The distributed data center Eggs Datacenter is the same as the usual data center, only:

    <ul><li>  without a physical defense system, such as tall walls and evil shepherds, </li><li>  without belief in the rules and standards of the 20th century, such as Tier 1-4, </li><li>  without unimaginable user density per host. </li></ul><br>  <b>- but with a hybrid business model.</b> <br><br>  In fact, it is a network of peer-to-peer servers located in small and medium-sized businesses in 17 regions of Russia.  Hosters (business) get cheap Internet at a price 30-50% lower than the market price, instead allowing them to host mobile servers based on the Mini-ITX form factor.  Each server is equipped with a 6 core Xeon processor with ECC, an Nvidia GeForce video card or a Radeon GTX, 16‚Äì32 GB of RAM, 1 TB SSD disk.  The average TDP does not exceed 600 watts.  As an Internet provider, the distributed data center controls the network stack at the L3 level, respectively, all traffic is filtered and carefully filtered.  Upstream are Avantel, Rinet, Er Telecom Holding and many other Internet providers seeking to download their fiber-optic networks.  The hypervisor uses open-source XenServer 7.2 (Xen 4.0) and CloudStack. <br><br><blockquote>  Blockchain is both a database for storing information and a guarantee for its immutability.  One of the uses of the blockchain was the recording and storage of important information in it in the form of ‚Äúname-value‚Äù parameters (NVS).  Implemented in the Emercoin blockchain, this solution allows you to locally save data from public SSH keys, SSL certificates and DNS records, without trusting a specific center.  Emercoin blockchain allows projects based on it to be both decentralized and protected at the same time.  Such is the power of cryptography. </blockquote><br>  Today, in a distributed data center, remote jobs are provided for small and micro businesses, freelancers, designers, miners and researchers of neural networks. <br><br>  A hybrid business model reduces the cost of services, the delay in signal delivery and the risks of theft of confidential information, because  all hosts are located locally and the average density of users per host is no more than 6 people.  But the hosts are worth antivirus and use FDE encryption to physically protect the user's hard disk in case of equipment theft / damage.  The blockchain is used as a local storage system for SSH keys and SSL certificates in order to avoid the Man in the Middle attack and to protect against DNS requests being compromised.  Among those who already use the services of the data center is the small business of <a href="http://eggstv.ru/">Eggs TV</a> in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod, Kazan, Yekaterinburg, etc.  Most hosters are network brands such as Mother and Child, Black Star, Dr Loder and others. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/5a4/c1b/df5/5a4c1bdf5b474ef38e2dbab5427c60ed.png"><br><br><h2>  Decentralized data center - distributed financing </h2><br>  To expand, the project needs more money to install servers and reconnect hosters to the Internet.  Eggs Datacenter decided to collect them through crowdfunding.  To <a href="http://eggsdc.com/ru/ico">collect funds</a> , EGS tokens on the Ethereum blockchain (standard ERC20) will be released, and upon completion, tokens will be used to pay cashback for the purchase of data center services: 10% of each purchase will be credited to tokens queue, you can pay to pay for the Internet as a small business, and ordinary users at home.  The planned buyout volume of tokens for cashback to users is 13,320,000 pieces from the maximum possible issue amount of 30,000,000 tokens. <br><br><h2>  How to participate in pre-ICO at Emercoin </h2><br>  For their Pre-ICO, Eggs Datacenter also chose Emercoin as the most suitable, in the opinion of the developers, for crowdfunding campaigns that comply with KYC / AML standards. <br><br>  To buy EGS at a discount of 20% to 50%, early investors will need to leave a request <a href="http://eggsdc.com/ru/ico">on the Eggs Datacenter website</a> .  They will receive a unique identifier and a list of unique wallets in 7 major currencies: USD, RUB, BTC, ETH / ETC, EMC, etc. <br><br>  After confirming the cryptocurrency transaction in three blocks, a DPO entry will be made in the Emercoin blockchain about the number of tokens that was paid at the time of the transaction.  Record type will be, for example, the following "dpo: EggsDC: SN100". <br><br>  You can check your entry directly <a href="https://emercoin.mintr.org/dpo/EggsDC">in the Emer-blockchain</a> or in any Emercoin wallet.  EGS tokens will be issued to ICO already on Ethereum, the link for which all pre-ICO participants will be credited to their email addresses. <br><br>  You can <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/B3A0xQyIvPTdFblAbUbAeA">chat</a> with the project developers in the <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/B3A0xQyIvPTdFblAbUbAeA">Telegram-chat</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f4f/ad8/0df/f4fad80df5de440aabd4d3bdd3fe8ac1.jpg"><br>  <i>EGGS Datacenter: We take care of the eggs</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/338572/">https://habr.com/ru/post/338572/</a></p>
