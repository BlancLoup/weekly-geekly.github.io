  <section class="page js-page"><h1>In defense of the gravity and color differentiation of pants ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Inspired by the topic For <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/popular_science/83100/">each nanosatellite on gravitsup!</a> <br>  In the comments, people began to actively sneer at the possibility of the existence of alternative existing engines and especially the possibility of the emergence of such developments in our country.  I was a little upset, and I decided to write this note. <br>  I will say right away that I am not a mechanic or a physicist and all my knowledge is rather superficial, and therefore the information I provide is taken from the network, but I am absolutely sure that the current situation with the internal combustion engine (internal combustion engine), or rather, the lack of alternatives to them simply beneficial oil tycoons.  And all promising developments in these areas are bought up and ‚Äúslaughtered‚Äù in order to preserve their super profits.  The emergence of hybrids is associated only with the desire of the authorities of those countries that are not rich in oil, to reduce their dependence on "raw superpowers."  And that is why I am sure that in our country such engines will not be developed and produced, except perhaps for lonely enthusiasts. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  So, for starters about today's news about the inertial engine and the word "nano", which has become equivalent to the sign of the degree in the estimated costs: <br>  Article with newsru from (note) <b>March 11, 2005.</b>  The words ‚Äúmodernization‚Äù and ‚Äúnanotechnologies‚Äù were then not in circulation, and Russia was actively ‚Äúgetting up from its knees‚Äù at the expense of oil packs. <br><br><h5>  In Moscow Region, the Research Institute of Space Systems (Scientific Research Institute of the CS) is developing a new generation engine that can be used both in space and on Earth. </h5><br>  ‚ÄúFor several years now, the institute has been working on the so-called propulsion unit without ejecting reactive mass,‚Äù said Valery Menshikov, director and scientific director of the scientific research institute of the compressor station.  According to him, "scientists have already created a prototype of an engine of an unconventional type," ITAR-TASS reported. <br>  ‚ÄúThe movement of the experimental apparatus occurs due to the movement inside it of a liquid or solid working fluid along a definite trajectory resembling a tornado shape,‚Äù explained Menshikov.  ‚ÄúAt the same time, in the resulting motion effect, we may observe an unknown phenomenon of the interaction of the working medium with fields, the nature of which has been little studied, such as, for example, the gravitational field,‚Äù he added. <br>  ‚ÄúOn the prototype, we have already managed to fix the thrust up to 28 g, but it has been observed for a few minutes so far,‚Äù said the head of the department of the scientific research institute of the CS Yury Danshov.  ‚ÄúIt may seem that this value of thrust is extremely small, but if such a thrust acts on a satellite weighing 100 kg for 20 minutes, it will be able to raise its orbit by more than 2 km,‚Äù said the scientist. <br>  The life of such an engine will be at least 15 years, its developers claim, the maximum number of inclusions is about 300 thousand. Solar power is used to power the engine. <br>  According to scientists from the Moscow region, the propulsion unit can be used not only to control and correct the orbits of spacecraft and orbital stations.  ‚ÄúThis environmentally friendly engine can be used in the future in air and ground transportation,‚Äù said Menshikov.

      So this is not a stupid cut of modern money, but at least a multi-year development.  And for those who are not a reader, but a writer, I would like to quote an excerpt from the above news: <i>‚ÄúIn addition, Major General rejected the allegations that considerable budget funds were spent on creating a working prototype.</i>  <i>‚ÄúWe carried out all our research, it can be said, on a voluntary basis.</i>  <i>Experimental installations did enthusiasts with their own hands.</i>  <i>You can now re-calculate the cost spent on experiments kilowatt-hours, iron bands and electric motors.</i>  <i>The amount is small and taken from the profit we received from the performance of the main work, "said Menshikov to the newspaper."</i> This is by the way about power-saw benches. <br><br>  Well, a little about alternatives ... <br><br><h4>  Steam engines: </h4><br>  At the beginning of the twentieth century, gasoline engines were not taken at all with a bang, and quite the opposite.  Steam engines were much more popular, so at the beginning of the twentieth century, the French company Serpole was widely known.  The steam car of this company, built in 1905, developed a speed of up to 120 km / h.  The company offered for sale steam cars with power plants ranging from 5 to 40 hp. <br>  Another interesting episode: <br>  <i>Acquaintance at the final stage of the Great Patriotic War and in the first post-war years with foreign equipment, both delivered under lend-lease and trophy, indicated a serious lag of the domestic auto industry from the world level.</i>  <i>Some types of cars in our country have never been produced, and foreign samples had no analogues.</i>  <i>Work on the detailed study of foreign scientific and technical experience in the automotive industry was entrusted to the largest industry institute - NAMI.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>In the first post-war year, the work in NAMI was distributed in the following areas: gas turbine engines (head of the bureau AA Dushkevich);</i>  <i>high-traffic and amphibious vehicles (head of the bureau and chief designer BV Shishkin);</i>  <i>development of issues related to the use of new types of energy in cars (head of the bureau Ph.D. Vysotsky);</i>  <i>gas generator engines (head of the bureau S.O. Bruman);</i>  <i>electromobiles (supervisor of the prof. GI Babat);</i>  <i>cars with steam power plants (head of the bureau Y.A. Shebalin, consultant S.V. Tatischev).</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Professor Babat led the testing of the Bleikhert EL-1800 and EL-2002 electric vehicles, which ultimately led to the appearance of several models of domestic electric vehicles that were in limited use.</i> <i><br><img src="http://i064.radikal.ru/1002/06/af1e73bc3b58.jpg" alt="image"><br></i>  <i>The test results of the Sachsenberg under the leadership of Shebalin and Tatishchev were discussed on July 2, 1946 at the NTS of Minavtoprom.</i>  <i>The results of the discussion were reported "to the top," and on August 7 of the following year, the USSR Government Decree No. 2804 ‚ÄúOn the Mechanization of Logging and the Development of New Forest Areas‚Äù was issued, which was ordered to produce a prototype of a forest steam car.</i>  <i>The decree also instructed the Spetstechburo MLPP in Germany to manufacture a mobile power station, the Central Research Institute of Lesosplav - to design a steamboat, and the Design Bureau of MLTI - to develop a steam locomotive.</i>  <i>Leningrad Thermal Engineering Institute.</i>  <i>Kalinin and TSNIIME were to develop a steam tractor.</i>  <i>After 3-4 years, all of these works, except for the steam car and the mobile power station, were curtailed for various reasons.</i> <i><br><img src="http://s005.radikal.ru/i209/1002/64/90e0f02d502b.jpg" alt="image"><br></i>  <i>The first prototype of a steam engine truck operating on firewood was manufactured by NAMI (the developers of Shebalin, Kurbatov, Tatishchev, Bychkov, Korotonoshko, and others) in accordance with the deadline specified in the resolution.</i>  <i>In addition to the steam car, NAMI developed a draft steam tractor PT-54.</i>  <i>In 1949, two steam cars NAMI-012 were manufactured.</i>  <i>In some documents, the car is referred to as "0125".</i>  <i>The car was built on the chassis of the YAZ (MAZ) -200 truck.</i> <i><br><img src="http://s004.radikal.ru/i207/1002/d3/44801c3ca932.jpg" alt="image"><br></i>  <i>The steam engine had cylinders with a diameter and a stroke of 125 mm each.</i>  <i>Power at a shaft speed of 1000 rpm was 100 l / s.</i>  <i>Transmission gear in the usual "car form" at NAMI-012 was absent.</i>  <i>Instead, the cut-off mechanism was applied.</i>  <i>The change in cut-offs and reverse was achieved by axial movement of the cam shaft.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The NAMI-012 steam engine had three cut-offs for driving forward (25, 40 and 75%) and one cut-off for driving backwards (80%).</i>  <i>When driving, the driver, if he had to use the clutch, then only to engage downshifting, otherwise there was enough of the cut-off lever.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>It is not very convenient to serve firewood, just as it was done on a steam train or in a village stove, so they tried to automate this process.</i>  <i>The fuel from the vertical bins as it burned out under the action of its own weight fell on the grate.</i>  <i>One ‚Äúrefueling‚Äù was enough for 80‚Ä¶ 100 km of run.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>In the first half of 1950, the first copy of NAMI-012 was subjected to comprehensive departmental tests with a total mileage of 12,000 km, the results of which the USSR Council of Ministers decided to conduct state tests.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>State tests of two steam cars took place from November 1950 to August 1951. One car had a mileage of 26,000 km, and the other - 15,500 km.</i>  <i>Car recognized the "workable design."</i>  <i>At the same time, it was noted that the car, due to the increased load on the front axle, has low forest traffic.</i>  <i>For this reason, on the basis of NAMI-012, an all-wheel drive NAMI-018 was developed.</i>  <i>They made two copies of NAMI-018, which were in trial operation at the Pervomaisky leprompromozh of the Gorkles Trust and the Chervensky Lespromkhoz in Belarus.</i>  <i>Cars received generally positive reviews.</i>  <i>However, they did not have the best dynamics - their speed did not exceed 20 km / h.</i>  <i>True, especially to accelerate in the forest and nowhere.</i>  <i>Nevertheless, in prototypes, the task of creating a vehicle operating on popular low-cost fuel was solved.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>By 1959, all work on steam cars were stopped.</i>  <i>It can be assumed that this was explained not so much by the fact that, with smaller dimensions of ICE, using gasoline, more ‚Äúhigh-calorie‚Äù than coal briquettes and firewood of various degrees of moisture, have a higher power than noticeably changed at the state level resources.</i> <br><br>  My opinion is that if the same attention as an internal combustion engine were paid to the improvement of steam engines, then we wouldn‚Äôt have talked about the internal combustion engine, otherwise it would be a misunderstanding and clumsy development of enthusiasts at the beginning of the twentieth century. <br><br><h4>  Centrifugal motor </h4><br>  There are several options for implementation.  However, most of them are either based on or ‚Äúintersect‚Äù with the Clem engine. <br>  As far as we know, Richard Clem died of a heart attack shortly after signing a contract with a coal company.  His workshop was visited by representatives of the authorities and all his notes and drawings were seized. <br>  The story we know about is as follows: <br>  <i>A Dallas native developed a closed engine that supposedly produces 350 horsepower and works on its own.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The engine weighs about 200 pounds (about 80kg) and contains vegetable oil at 300 F (150 C).</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Inside the engine there is a cone fixed on the horizontal axis.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The shaft on which the cone is fastened is empty inside and turns into spiral hollow channels inside the cone.</i>  <i>They wind the cone and end at its base with nozzles (nozzles).</i> <i><br><img src="http://s003.radikal.ru/i202/1002/f4/c4ea26c9b7b4.png" alt="image"><br></i>  <i>Fluid is supplied to the central axis at a pressure of 300-500 psi, passes through spiral channels and is injected through the nozzles, which causes the cone to rotate.</i>  <i>The greater the fluid pressure, the faster the cone rotates.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>With a further increase in speed, the fluid heats up, which requires a heat exchanger and a filter.</i>  <i>At a certain speed, the cone starts independent rotation, independent of the engine.</i>  <i>The speed of rotation of the shaft reaches 1800-2300 revolutions per minute.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>As soon as the inventor had a heart attack and his documents were withdrawn, his son took one active engine to a farm near Dallas.</i>  <i>There he poured concrete at a depth of 10 feet, and the engine continued to work at that depth for several years.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>From further conversation it followed that the motor was tested by Bendix Corporation.</i>  <i>The test was to attach the engine to a dynamometer to measure power on the shaft.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Measurements showed that the engine steadily produced 350 horsepower for 9 days, which struck engineers at Bendix.</i>  <i>They concluded that a source that can produce so much energy in a closed system for such a long time can only be nuclear.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The design of the engine does not contain unconventional parts, with the exception of the cone with spiral channels and the hollow shaft.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Richard Clem worked in the field of heavy engineering in a suburb of Dallas.</i>  <i>He noticed that certain types of high-power pumps continued to work for some time after the power was turned off.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>His curiosity about this phenomenon led to the invention of the engine.</i> <br><br>  In addition to the options with a liquid in the engine case, there are developments of engines operating according to the Clem engine principle, but without fluids, and due to the work of air molecules when their temperatures change.  Engines based on the tornado principle. <br><br><h4>  Inertial propulsion </h4><br>  <i>Inertial, inertial propulsion (erroneous name ‚Äúinertial engine‚Äù) is a mechanism, an apparatus, a device that is able to come in a forward movement in space (or along the surface) without interaction with the environment, but only by moving the working fluid inside.</i>  <i>The possibility of such a mover is denied by classical mechanics.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The first inertsoid was invented by engineer Vladimir Tolchin in the 1930s.</i>  <i>The ‚ÄúTolchin cart‚Äù is a platform on wheels, at the top of which one or two weights move on the levers: one way slowly, and the other faster.</i>  <i>Although no power transmission leads to the wheels, such a cart comes in an uneven, but directed movement.</i>  <i>A similar effect (but with movement in the opposite direction) is also observed when the inercoid is installed on the floating model.</i>  <i>In the mid-1970s, the topic of inercoids was extremely popular: these cars were shown on television, popular youth science and technology magazines wrote about them.</i> <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/aYUfN1HszDU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhtPDm1r1YF-We3rM1iP1BhZjk0OA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/J756K9tGF5U%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhOlPERI2iAbpML38rBS_NCfktvOA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><br><h5>  Instead of conclusion </h5><br>  This is what I remembered to vskidku, not really rummaging through the network.  I am sure that there are other projects of alternative internal combustion engines, but I strongly doubt that they will be developed and launched into wide production, for the reasons I mentioned at the beginning of the article. <br>  PS In the end, Tesla achieved the transmission of electricity without wires in the early twentieth century, and the commercial implementation begins only now.  And I‚Äôm not very sure that this is a new invention, and not some old diaries, which, finally, they thought it necessary to pull out of the special stores. <br><br>  UPD.  1) There was a slight misunderstanding.  The test, which is in italics is not mine, so do not blame me for promoting "perpetual motion machines", etc. <br>  2) As <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/selenit/" class="user_link">SelenIT</a> correctly noted <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/selenit/" class="user_link">in the</a> section on ‚ÄúInertial Propulsion‚Äù, this is not the place as it cannot be attributed to engines, which I actually wanted to write about.  I will not delete it, so that some comments will not "hang in the air." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83237/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83237/</a></p>
