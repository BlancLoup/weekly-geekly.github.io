Simply, IE 6 does not comply with modern w3c standards, which makes it difficult to make beautiful, competent code, constantly making corrections to IE 6. amendments). <br><br>  Personally, I do not express claims to the browser because of its inconsistencies with modern layout standards.  First, I understand that at one time this browser has done a lot for the development of the Internet.  Secondly, I, as a professional in my field, know the problems of IE 6 and know how to get around them.  However, I can also complain that the imperfection of IE 6 does not allow to use the full power of technology and to do its work even faster and better. <br><br>  Why am I paying so much attention to IE 6?  Because still a huge number of Internet users see sites through IE 6.

      Why do users need to update the browser? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  If you think about it, users are not interested in the problems of web designers, they don‚Äôt care about the cost of developing websites, which depends on the time spent on fine-tuning the layout for displaying in IE 6. Users are even interested that they have to download extra kilobytes of patches for IE 6. <br><br>  But there is one very important point that users should definitely think about.  This is safety. <br><br>  Probably it is no secret to anyone that there are a huge number of viruses and Trojans on the Internet.  And, of course, most of them are written under the most popular browser, that is, IE 6. Try to see the results of issuing <a href="http://yandex.ru/yandsearch%3Ftext%3D%25D0%25B4%25D1%258B%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%2B%25D0%25B2%2B%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%2BIE%2B6">Yandex</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/search%3Fhl%3Dru%26sa%3DX%26oi%3Dspell%26resnum%3D0%26ct%3Dresult%26cd%3D1%26q%3D%25D0%25B4%25D1%258B%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%2B%25D0%25B2%2B%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%2BIE6%26spell%3D1">Google</a> on the query ‚ÄúIE6 security hole‚Äù.  You will see more than 40,000 pages pointing to various security holes in the browser.  Surely you yourself were attacked by viruses.  For example, you could have changed the start page and the "favorites", shortcuts to websites on the desktop (and these are only attacks that you see).  Also, your computer could become a member of the botnet and conduct ddos-attacks on various sites.  Well, in the worst case, the attackers could steal your passwords and use both your account to access the Internet and your electronic money, profiles on various sites or email. <br><br>  Of course, Microsoft is aware of the flaws in the browser and used to constantly release updates for IE 6, making it more stable and secure. <br><br>  However, there are 2 reasons for reflection: <br><ul><li>  Most users put only Service Packs for the operating system, which includes updates for the browser.  It turns out that the browser is updated too slowly and attackers can use its vulnerabilities. </li><li>  The auto-update feature is disabled in pirated windows. </li></ul><br><br>  Keep in mind that if you use browsers on the IE 6 engine (such as MyIE, Maxthon), you are also subject to the threat of a virus attack, because they do not protect against security holes of the IE6 browser, providing only more convenient for the user interface. <br><br>  And finally, I want to present a graph of the share of browsers under which users go to our blog (liveinternet).  This graph clearly shows a tendency to reduce the share of IE 6. <br><br><img src="http://i.li.ru/i/s/3mD9c4.png" width="450" height="350" alt="Share of browsers per week according to LI statistics" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Crosspost from my branch of <a href="http://blog.htc-cs.ru/post/2008-07-21-pochemu-ya-protiv-ie6.aspx">corporate blog</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29709/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29709/</a></p>
