      Of course, there are exceptions, with this I am not going to argue.  The purpose of my post is not to smear all with brown paint, but to tell about my view on the reasons for the extremely low level of industrial and managerial culture in modern Russia. <br><br>  In fact, it applies to almost all industries, just IT-specialists somewhat easier to change the domestic employer to the western or eastern. <br><br>  In the post-Soviet period, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa leader as a person who extracts material and other benefits for himself solely due to his position in the administrative hierarchy has taken root in the mass consciousness.  That is, it is more about the feudal lord than about a qualified manager.  While in some other cultures, there is a perception of the manager as a person who organizes processes and is personally responsible for the results of these processes. <br><br>  In addition to other factors, it is extremely unpleasant for a qualified specialist to work under the direction of a person who, I am sorry, does not really understand, not that the subject area, but even what an ‚Äúorder‚Äù, ‚Äúcommission‚Äù, etc., means.  At least at the level of the foreman of the military service (‚ÄúThe order is formulated clearly, briefly and clearly without the use of formulations that allow different interpretations ...‚Äù). <br><br>  I will give a couple of ordinary examples, and not specifically from the field of IT, in order to emphasize the managerial component. <br><br>  Not so long ago, I ordered a fresh air ventilation with installation. <br><br>  A man came to the measurements without any understanding what to do.  It turned out that he was a subcontractor who was told to drill the wall for the inlet ventilation system.  But its equipment is not designed for drilling holes of such a small diameter, in addition, it can not be used in residential areas.  A qualified engineer with extensive experience installing industrial systems felt clearly uncomfortable: he looked helpless, because  I could not solve a fairly simple task and wasted time on departure. <br><br>  The ‚Äúmanager‚Äù who sent him there is completely incompetent as a manager.  Obviously, the order that he gave was something like: "Uh, well, this one, in short, you need to put a bailout at such an address."  While I, an ordinary consumer, immediately explained that it required drilling a 100 mm diameter hole in a brick wall of a residential building 70 cm thick, with a slope of about 3-4 degrees at the height of the 4th floor and therefore an autotower would be required during installation, and .d <br><br>  This is a pretty typical case.  The problem is not that the ‚Äúmanager‚Äù does not understand anything in ventilation systems or does not understand anything in installation technology.  In principle, he does not understand what ‚Äúorder‚Äù, ‚Äúorder‚Äù, ‚Äúinstruction‚Äù is.  And this misunderstanding does not give him the slightest discomfort. <br><br>  Another example is from the industry that we so love to be proud of and often take the example of raw materials.  Oil field in the North.  The process of putting the well into operation occurs.  The boss is in a hurry and gives the order to increase the pump speed, qualified operators refuse, referring to the fact that this is not necessary, because  a number of technological errors.  The boss begins to be rude, he is reminded that in this case, according to the regulations, it is the duty of the technologist and chief engineer.  As a result, the chief engineer with the technologist increases the speed and burns the pump for several hundred thousand dollars.  The reason is the inability of the technical management to correctly interpret the data of the echo sounder (roughly speaking, the pump was immersed in paraffin foam, not in the well fluid, for this reason it was deprived of cooling, well, it is clear what happened next). <br><br>  Here we see not just incompetence in a particular subject area, but also the inability to delegate the decision to a qualified specialist.  And also irresponsibility, since no one was punished for bringing losses to the company for millions of dollars. <br><br>  I see such examples almost daily and I can write more than a dozen of such stories, a common feature of which will be the incompetence of the management and the absence of any sanctions against the management.  That is, we are not talking about isolated cases, but about a very specific management culture.  And if this culture cannot compete for qualified labor resources neither with America, nor with Europe, nor even with Asia - maybe the matter is still not in the <s>reel of the</s> insidious West? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285508/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285508/</a></p>
