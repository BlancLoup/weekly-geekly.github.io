How will it go?  Who will attend it?  This is nothing special, but you can better prepare and feel comfortable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a0/474/583/6a047458339c49929170f21459ac74ee.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  <b>1. Behavioral interview</b> </h4><h6>  In this case, employers are trying to learn about your personality and your interpersonal skills to see if you are a good fit for the position and how you will interact with the team.  They focus on experience, behavior, knowledge, skills, and skills associated with work.  In this case, you should answer the questions, giving examples from your previous work experience, mentioning your hobbies, as well as activities, school projects and volunteer programs in which you participated. </h6>

    <h4>  <b>2. Technical interview</b> </h4><h6>  During a technical interview, your job-related skills are evaluated, such as, for example, design skills or computer skills.  This type of interview is usually conducted by someone equal to you in status or by a specialist who is quite well oriented in what a new employee should be able to do, so it is in his power to determine your abilities. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>3. Case interview</b> </h4><h6>  It usually includes a business case with which the employer or employees of the company worked.  It usually includes a problem or task that needs to be solved.  In this type of interview, employers usually want to see your method of working with the problem, and what steps you take to solve it.  Often it is in this way that consulting companies are hired by employees. </h6><br>  <b>You can get acquainted with business cases <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/projects">on our website</a> - solve the problems of large companies, get a cash reward or the opportunity to get a job.</b> <br><br><h4>  <b>4. Trial interview</b> </h4><h6>  It's like a real interview rehearsal.  As a rule, the recruitment agency conduct test interviews with you so that you can get used to the situation and the environment and get better prepared.  This is a great way to get a sober assessment of your ability to hold on. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>5. Group interview</b> </h4><h6>  This type of interview allows you to simultaneously contact many other candidates for your position - after all, they will ask you questions!  For most applicants, this prospect seems truly frightening.  But do not worry!  You can find out how to distinguish yourself during a group interview by reading my previous blog post. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>6. Interview at the university</b> </h4><h6>  A similar event is held by employers in the territory of a college or university.  It is organized exclusively for students.  This is truly a good opportunity to show yourself if you are a student.  For example, if you participate in the "Career Day".  You are in a familiar place and generally feel more confident than if the interview was conducted at the company's office. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>7. Telephone interview</b> </h4><h6>  To conduct an interview with you on such a plan, they will call you by telephone. Companies often use telephone interviews to narrow down the list of candidates for the position.  Human resources departments prefer to communicate with applicants in order to obtain basic information about them, for example, to learn about their attitude to work, expected salary, readiness to move if necessary, etc.  You can read the previous entry in my blog to learn about the features of the interview by phone and how to successfully pass it. </h6></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296498/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296498/</a></p>
