This is the <a href="http://chrishecker.com/images/c/c2/Gdmphys2.pdf">second</a> translated article from the series of articles on the creation of the physics engine of the authorship of Chris Hecker.  If you have not yet familiarized with the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/449358/">first</a> , I recommend to do it, because everything will immediately become clearer.  Many thanks for the support of the first translation: it is very stimulating to work further and more!  Enjoy reading! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Physics, Part 2, Angle Effects </h1><br>  I just wanted to back up the door with something heavy, so that the intruder wouldn't enter me.  Do I really ask for a lot?  I want his car turned over and exploded in a certain place.  I want huge gears jammed before flattening me.  And I want to hastily build a piece that looks like a swing, in order to catapult a lovely, flaming gift through the castle's fortified wall.  Who can prevent me from making this all a reality?  You will assume that my opponent is in the game world, but in reality it is a physical engine programmer, because all of the above is based on the angular effect.  You can count on one hand those games where corner effects are implemented, not to mention finding at least one in which this is done correctly. <br><br>  The main reason why angular (or otherwise rotational) effects are not implemented in games today is that programmers believe that the physics describing the rotational motion is too complicated to understand and translate into reality.  The physics lessons in high school (where we all learned Newton's second law) usually do not talk about rotational effects, and it is not quite obvious how to move from the force applied to an object to the rotation of this object.  Of course, the dynamics of rotational motion is a little harder to understand than the dynamics of linear motion, but it is simpler than it seems.  Anyone who can create a physical engine in accordance with the material presented in the first article of the cycle will cope with the inclusion of the angular effects described in this article.  It is hoped that after the publication of this article, the world will be filled with games that use all the possibilities and advantages of angular effects, or at least you can create a game in which you, having curved up, shoot your friend‚Äôs leg in a deadly battle. <br><br><h2>  Brief repetition </h2><br>  Despite the fact that each of my articles is on a single topic, I always re-read what I wrote earlier in order to understand where I graduated.  I just looked at my first article on physics, and I am delighted: we managed to learn so much, and, moreover, we never wrote a program code or read additional literature!  Before we begin, let's refresh the material from the last article.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pg/pb/0a/pgpb0af7kv5hm83jcpr36sqemy0.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Table 1 contains the most important conclusions for the dynamics of solids.  From Equation 1, it follows that the coordinate vector (r), the velocity vector (v), and the acceleration vector (a) are related by derivatives (and integrals, if read in reverse order).  As a reminder, we mark the differentiation by time with a stroke (r ').  r 'is the same as dr / dt, and r' 'is the same as the second derivative with respect to time.  From Equation 2 it follows that the force is associated with a linear impulse (the product of mass and speed), mass, and acceleration.  The determination of the center of mass can be drawn from Equation 3 (this is the point where all masses and distances balance each other).  Equation 4 states that the total linear impulse of a solid is the sum of all its impulses, which, to our luck, are simply equal to the impulse of the center of mass (CM).  Equation 5 is a real gem.  It uses Equation 4 to demonstrate that the acceleration of the center of mass of an object is related to the total force (the sum vector of all forces acting on the object at a given time) by a scalar value, the mass of the object. <br><br>  To summarize everything described in the first article: we learned that the total force acting on our center of mass is equal to the sum of all forces applied to the body (including gravity, the wagon of the villain, an explosion nearby, the thrust impulse of our engine, etc. .).  Then we divided this sum vector into body mass in order to get the acceleration CM, and then we integrated the acceleration over time to get the speed and the coordinate of the body. <br><br>  Equation 5 is just a masterpiece!  You will see that there is no concept of points of application of forces to the body, and this is the key point for determining how the body will rotate under their action.  Equation 5 is correct.  In fact, it is excellent for finding linear acceleration.  We miss half the battle.  But everything is in order ... <br><br><h2>  What is your angle? </h2><br>  In the first article, rotation was ignored, so we needed only the radius vector and its derivative to describe our body configuration in 2D.  Now we add one more kinematics, the orientation (denoted by the capital letter omega - Œ©), in order to work with corner effects.  In order to set Œ©, we need to choose a coordinate system relative to a solid and a coordinate system of the game world, and the value Œ© will be equal to the difference of angles between them in radians, as shown in Figure 1. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o4/rz/dk/o4rzdk5znch5pep27kxox_ctvze.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Figure 1.</i> Definition of Œ© <br><br>  In the figure, the axes xw, yw are the coordinate axes of the game world, and xb, yb are the axes of the coordinates of the solid.  Œ© is greater than 0 if counted counterclockwise.  Here it is important to clarify why we study the dynamics of a two-dimensional world before moving into a three-dimensional one: orientation in 2D is a scalar value (the angle between coordinate systems in radians), while determining orientation in a three-dimensional world is much more difficult. <br><br>  As the body rotates, the magnitude of Œ© changes.  This change leads us to a different magnitude of kinematics ‚Äî angular velocity (denoted by the lowercase letter omega ‚Äî œâ).  In contrast to the coordinate and linear velocity of the body, we do not denote the angular velocity as follows - Œ© '.  However, sometimes we denote the derivative of speed with respect to time, or angular acceleration, as œâ '(this is another kinematics quantity) or Œ± (lower case alpha).  Do not blame me: I did not invent all these designations;  and in each book that I read, there are small differences.  Our angular counterpart for Equation 1 is: <br><br><p><math> </math> $$ display $$ {d ^ 2 Œ© \ over {dt ^ 2}} = {dœâ \ over {dt}} = œâ '= Œ± $$ display $$ </p><br><br>  <i>Equation 6</i> <br><br>  As in Equation 1, we differentiate œâ in time to get Œ±;  and if we integrate Œ± over time, we get œâ, etc. Everything is similar to the previous article: knowing the angular acceleration Œ±, we can integrate it twice to get a new orientation.  But the key point here is to know the value of Œ±. <br><br>  As can be expected, our goal for this article is to derive the angular analogue for each of the linear equations in Table 1, and then, taking into account the linear and angular equations and the force applied to the object, we can calculate its linear acceleration a and angular acceleration Œ±.  Finally, we can numerically integrate these accelerations to find new positions and orientations of our bodies. <br><br>  To begin with, we link the linear and angular values ‚Äã‚Äãtogether.  And this is a rather unobvious trick that uses angular velocity.  When calculating the dynamics, we often need to find the velocity of an arbitrary point of the object.  For example, when we calculate the collisions of solids, we must know the speed of the colliding points in order to understand how hard they hit each other.  If our bodies do not rotate, the speed of each point of the body is the same.  We can simply follow the speed of the center of mass of the body, and this will be enough.  Whereas if our bodies rotate, each point of these bodies can have a different speed.  Obviously, we can not calculate the speed of an infinite number of points of our solid body, so we need a different, better solution. <br><br>  One of the simple ways that are used to find the linear velocity of any point inside the object uses the angular velocity of the object.  Consider the case when the body rotates only around one fixed point O, without changing the coordinate of the body.  That is, the body rotates, but does not move.  From Equation 7 it follows how to calculate the speed of point B of a rotating body: <br><br><p><math> </math> $$ display $$ v ^ B = œâr ^ {OB} _‚üÇ $$ display $$ </p><br><br>  <i>Equation 7</i> <br><br>  We need to clarify a couple of points in Equation 7, let's spend some time on it.  First, I use upper indexing to show which parameter belongs to these points, so v ^ B is the velocity vector of point B of our body.  Similarly, r ^ OB denotes a vector drawn from the center of rotation of our body O to point B. A funny inverted letter T is a ‚Äúperpendicular operator‚Äù that acts on a vector (like the vector r in Equation 7) and rotates it 90 degrees counterclockwise arrows.  In other words, a new vector is built that is perpendicular to the old one.  In a two-dimensional world, a vector perpendicular to (x, y) is simply (-y, x).  You can easily check my words on a piece of graph paper.  Let's talk more about this.  The value of the perpendicular vector is determined by the angular velocity œâ and sets the linear velocity v ^ B.  Speaking in Russian, Equation 7 shows that the speed of a point of a rotating body is calculated by multiplying the perpendicular vector drawn from the center of rotation by the angular velocity.  How do I understand this?  Well, I read about it in the book, but it is obvious that such an explanation is not enough, so we will prove that it is true. <br><br>  Let us prove the truth of the conclusions from Equation 7 in two stages.  First, we prove that the value of the resulting velocity vector is correct;  then - that its direction is correct.  For the first part of the proof, consider Figure 2. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bc/68/za/bc68zahbdra2q6incbrowm0sceg.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Figure 2.</i> C = Œ©r <br><br>  Figure 2 shows the rotation of point B by an angle equal to Œ© radians along the rotation of a solid with a radius vector of length r directed from the center of rotation of the body O to point B. B has passed the arc length C, where C = Œ©r from the definition of radians.  (The radian angle measure is a measure of an arc bounded by the radius of a circle. The circumference of a circle is C = 2œÄr, because the radian measure of a circular arc is 2œÄ [or 360 degrees]). <br><br>  The speed of a point is the change in its time coordinate.  Therefore, we can find the velocity of point B ‚Äî in other words, the magnitude of the velocity vector ‚Äî by differentiating the equations of motion over time.  C = Œ©r is the equation of motion. <br><br><p></p><p><math></math><span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math MJXp-display" id="MJXp-Span-47"><span class="MJXp-mrow" id="MJXp-Span-48"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-49">d</span><span class="MJXp-mo" id="MJXp-Span-50" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 0em;">(</span><span class="MJXp-mrow" id="MJXp-Span-51"><span class="MJXp-mo" id="MJXp-Span-52" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 0em;">Œ©</span></span><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-53">r</span><span class="MJXp-mo" id="MJXp-Span-54" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 0em;">)</span><span class="MJXp-mtext" id="MJXp-Span-55">&nbsp;</span><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-56">o</span><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-57">v</span><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-58">e</span><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-59">r</span><span class="MJXp-mrow" id="MJXp-Span-60"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-61">d</span><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-62">t</span></span></span><span class="MJXp-mo" id="MJXp-Span-63" style="margin-left: 0.333em; margin-right: 0.333em;">=</span><span class="MJXp-mrow" id="MJXp-Span-64"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-65">d</span><span class="MJXp-mrow" id="MJXp-Span-66"><span class="MJXp-mo" id="MJXp-Span-67" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 0em;">Œ©</span></span><span class="MJXp-mtext" id="MJXp-Span-68">&nbsp;</span><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-69">o</span><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-70">v</span><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-71">e</span><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-72">r</span><span class="MJXp-mrow" id="MJXp-Span-73"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-74">d</span><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-75">t</span></span></span><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-76">r</span><span class="MJXp-mo" id="MJXp-Span-77" style="margin-left: 0.333em; margin-right: 0.333em;">=</span><span class="MJXp-mrow" id="MJXp-Span-78"><span class="MJXp-mo" id="MJXp-Span-79" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 0em;">œâ</span></span><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-80">r</span></span></span><div class="MathJax_SVG_Display MathJax_SVG_Processing"><span class="MathJax_SVG" id="MathJax-Element-3-Frame" tabindex="0" style="font-size: 100%; display: inline-block;"></span></div><script type="math/tex;mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-3"> {d (Œ©r) \ over {dt}} = {dŒ© \ over {dt}} r = œâr </script></p><br><br>  The radius is taken out for the sign of differentiation, since it is a constant (Point B simply rotates, without linear displacement), and the time derivative Œ© is œâ from Equation 6. Therefore, the magnitude of vector B is the velocity vector œâr. <br><br>  By considering Equation 7, we note that the velocity vector is correct, since the perpendicular does not affect the length of the vector and r ^ OB is the radius vector directed from O to B. Fuh, we are halfway there. <br><br>  In order to verify the correctness of the direction of the velocity vector in Equation 7, let us begin by making sure that the velocity vector should be perpendicular to the radius vector.  This assumption is intuitively understandable, because a point rotating around some other given point can move only perpendicular to the vector between these points.  It cannot approach the center of rotation or move away from it, or this movement simply ceases to be a rotation.  We can back up our assumption with calculations for vectors, but I am clamped in a certain framework by the length of the article, so we will assume that our assumption is correct.  (If you are eager to prove it yourself, differentiate the scalar product of a fixed-length vector with itself.) <br><br>  Finally, we must make sure that the vector is designated correctly, because the figure shows two vectors of equal length perpendicular to the radius: v and -v.  Since the magnitude of Œ© is measured counterclockwise, œâ&gt; 0 when the point rotates clockwise.  The perpendicular points in a clockwise direction, like the radius vector.  Figure 3 shows the conclusions from Equation 7: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gb/9k/7a/gb9k7aoyoseawqk8xixqtwxbscu.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Figure 3. The</i> relationship of linear velocity and angular <br><br>  We add Equation 7 to describe the rotation of moving bodies.  Consider the motion of a rigid body, as a simple movement of the center of rotation of the body and a simple rotation of the rest of the body around this point.  For those who are interested, this is the Shalya Theorem on the classification of movements. <br><br>  Shalya's theorem breaks our motion into two components - linear and angular.  Let the center of rotation of the body O be the only moving point, then use œâ to calculate the rotation around the point O, and this gives us the general form of Equation 7: <br><br><p><math> </math> $$ display $$ v ^ B = v ^ O + œâr ^ {OB} _‚üÇ $$ display $$ </p><br><br>  <i>Equation 9</i> <br><br>  Equation 9 states that we can calculate the speed of any point of a moving body using the linear velocity of the center of rotation of the body and, in addition, the velocity acquired during the rotation of the body. <br><br><h2>  Reason for our impulse </h2><br><br>  Now we can write the angular analogue of Equation 2, the equation of force.

It follows from this that the angular momentum of a point must be measured for a different place in the game world, in contrast to the linear impulse, which is determined for a given point (the product of its mass and velocity).  This is shown through upper indexing in Equation 10. The record L ^ AB states that the angular momentum is measured for point B from point A (the center of rotation of the body).  Imagine an arrow pointing from point A to point B. This arrow is the radius vector between two points, denoted by r ^ AB.  So, the angular momentum of a point is the scalar product of the linear momentum vector and the radius vector perpendicular to it.  This operation is called ‚Äúscalar product with perpendicular‚Äù, and is a 2D analogue for the 3D vector product, but we will discuss it another time. <br><br>  If you graphically depict what follows from equation 10, on paper - as I did in Figure 4 - you will see that it determines the measure of how the linear moment of point B "rotates around" A. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u9/hk/0c/u9hk0cxepzldmrszxpkcsfublfy.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Figure 4.</i> Momentum impulse <br><br>  Everything is correct if the momentum of point B points directly to point A, Equation 10 = 0 (since the perpendicular to r forms a right angle with p, and the scalar product will be equal to 0).  The greater the magnitude of the pulse B, directed perpendicular to A, the greater the magnitude of the angular momentum.  As you can see in Figure 4, the scalar product in Equation 10 has as a parameter the cosine of the angle Œ∏, which is contained between the perpendicular r ^ AB to p ^ B.  If we look at it from the other side, the magnitude of the scalar product is given by the sine of the angle œÜ between the original, not perpendicular r ^ AB and p ^ B (the sine is another key to unraveling the connection between the vector and scalar product).

From the foregoing it follows that the moment of force is connected with the force at a certain point by means of a scalar product. <br><br>  Finally, we obtained the dynamic equation, which uses the point of application of force, which was previously ignored in the linear momentum equations.  In Equation 11, a scalar product with a perpendicular is used as a measure of how much of the force applied to point B ‚Äúrotates‚Äù point A;  This ‚Äúrotational force‚Äù is called the moment of force.  Equation 11 allows you to find the numerical value of the moment of force - and hence the angular moment, if we integrate the moment of force, knowing the applied force and the point of application. <br><br>  Nevertheless, we still have not obtained the equation of the connection between the moment of force and the angular magnitudes of the kinematics that we need to rotate an object around its axis ‚Äî such as angular acceleration, angular velocity, or orientation.  Therefore, we cannot advance further until we derive a few more equations. <br><br><h2>  The moment we all waited </h2><br>  Before we make the connection between the dynamics and kinematics, we must define the total angular momentum, by analogy with how we determined the total linear momentum in Equation 4. I did not forget about the angular equivalent for the center of mass in Equation 3;  we will see it in the equation of the total angular momentum. <br><br>  The total angular momentum around point A is denoted by L ^ AT and is given by Equation 12: <br><br><p></p><p><math></math><span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit;"><span class="MJXp-math MJXp-display" id="MJXp-Span-228"><span class="MJXp-msubsup" id="MJXp-Span-229"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-230" style="margin-right: 0.05em;">L</span><span class="MJXp-mrow MJXp-script" id="MJXp-Span-231" style="vertical-align: 0.5em;"><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-232">A</span><span class="MJXp-mi MJXp-italic" id="MJXp-Span-233">T</span></span></span><span class="MJXp-mo" id="MJXp-Span-234" style="margin-left: 0.333em;

In the right-hand part, I used the definition of a linear impulse to represent p ^ i as the product of mass and velocity (mv).  This will be useful to me in the future in order to make something of Equation 12 with a more pronounced applied character.  The equation says that to find the total angular momentum for our object, it is necessary to sum the angular momentum of all its points.  For a solid body consisting of faces (rather than individual points), it is necessary to calculate the integral, by a non-discrete sum. <br><br>  Fortunately, we can simplify our calculations by introducing a new quantity called the ‚Äúmoment of inertia,‚Äù just as we introduced the center of mass to simplify the full momentum equation.  Recall that, thanks to Equation 7, we can find the velocity of a point through the angular velocity.  If the point A in Equation 12 is the cent of rotation from Equation 7, and the index of summation i in Equation 12 is the point B from Equation 7, then it is possible to convert Equation 7 to Equation 12. We get: <br><br><p><math> </math> $$ display $$ L ^ {AT} = \ sum _ {i} {\ vec r ^ {Ai} \ times m ^ i œâ \ vec r ^ {Ai}} = œâ {\ sum _ {i} {m ^ i \ vec r ^ {Ai} \ times \ vec r ^ {Ai}}} = œâ \ sum_ {i} {m ^ i (\ vec r ^ {Ai}) ^ 2} = œâI ^ A $$ display $$ </p><br><br>  <i>Equation 13</i> <br><br>  I will sign Equation 13 in more detail, step by step.  We first replace Equation 7 with 12 in order to get the sum in Equation 13. This replacement allows us to describe the angular momentum using the angular velocity.  Next, we put œâ for the sum, because it is equal for all points of the solid (the angular velocity is determined for the whole body, and not for each of its separate points), and we write the mass with the index i to the left, in order to see the dot product radius -vector on itself.  This scalar product is equal to the square of the length of the radius-vector (the scalar product of any vector on itself = the square of its length. Remember that the perpendicular operator does not change the length of the vector.).  Finally, we write I ^ A in order to designate the moment of inertia around point A. <br><br>  The moment of inertia for a two-dimensional solid is an extremely good number, because the points that make up the body cannot change their mass or move away from the center of rotation.  As a consequence of these two properties, the sum in Equation 13 is a constant for each body, so we can calculate it.  Speaking in Russian, I ^ A is the sum of the distances squared from point A to all other points of the body, and each such distance is scaled according to the mass of each point.  Just as for the center of mass ‚Äî if the body is more solid than a composite of discrete points, then the sums will turn into integrals.  And the moment of inertia will remain the same in magnitude and will have the same physical meaning. <br><br>  Determining the moment of inertia around a point is verbose, but think of I ^ A as a measure of how difficult it is to turn the body around point A. For example, imagine a pencil (a flat pencil).  If we measure the moment of inertia near the center of the pencil, we obtain a certain value equal to the sum of squares of distances, scaled according to the mass of each point.  Whereas if we measure the inertia at about the tip of the same pencil, we will get a larger value, because the farther the points with mass are removed, the greater the value of the squares of their distances.  Here it will be mathematically formulated that we understand intuitively: the rotation of a pencil around its center is much simpler (read it spends less power) than the rotation of it around one of the ends. <br><br>  Finally, we are ready to make a connection between the angular equations of dynamics and the angular equations of kinematics.  If we differentiate Equation 13, we get the total moment of force on the left, and the product of the moment of inertia and the angular acceleration on the right (I ^ A is a constant, we take it beyond the sign of differentiation): <br><br><p><math> </math> $$ display $$ œÑ ^ {AT} = {dL ^ {AT} \ over dt} = {d (I ^ A œâ) \ over dt} = I ^ A œâ = I ^ A Œ± $$ display $$ </p><br><br>  <i>Equation 14</i> <br><br>  This equation is the angular equivalent of Equation 5;  in fact, this is F = ma for angular dynamics.  This is the equation of the coupling of the total moment of force and the angular acceleration of the body by means of the scalar moment of inertia  If we know the moment of force exerted on our body, we can find its angular acceleration, and then the angular velocity and orientation in space through integration - by dividing the moment of force by the moment of inertia. <br><br><h2>  Dynamics algorithm </h2><br>  It is difficult for us to see it through this vortex of equations, but all of them are its integral part.  We derived enough equations in order to obtain the magnificent dynamics of a two-dimensional world with arbitrarily given forces and torques moving and rotating our objects.  How to use these equations?  Below is the basic algorithm: <br><br><ol><li>  Find the magnitude of the center of mass and the moment of inertia at the center of mass. </li><li>  Set the initial coordinates of the body, its orientation in space, its linear and angular velocity. </li><li>  Take into account all the forces acting on the body and the points of their application. </li><li>  Find the resultant of all forces and divide it by body mass in order to find the linear acceleration of the center of mass (Equation 5). </li><li>  For each force, construct a scalar product with a perpendicular between the vector directed from the center of mass to the point of application of force and the vector of applied force, add this value to the total moment of force in the center of mass equation (Equation 11). </li><li>  Find the quotient for the total moment of force and moment of inertia at the center of mass to find the angular acceleration (Equation 14). </li><li>  Numerically integrate linear acceleration and angular acceleration to update coordinates, linear velocity, orientation in space, and angular velocity (see the last article). </li><li>  Draw an object in the resulting coordinate, and go to Step 3. </li></ol><br>  In the algorithm above there are only two steps that I have not explained.  First, how to calculate the moment of inertia in Step 1 for a solid object?  Secondly, how to solve the problem with the forces from Step 3?  The answer to the first question can be found in a simple code example, which I will leave in the appendix at the end of this article (you will integrate the object by its area).  Many books on dynamics contain the calculated moment of inertia for frequently encountered forms of objects in the application at the very end, so you do not have to display them yourself every time. <br><br>  The answer to the question of how to calculate the forces from Step 3 depends on the application, but I will give some general recommendations.  First, such forces as gravity, always directed in one direction (down, in the case of gravity), do not create a moment of force, since they are pulling all points at the same time in one direction, although we We apply these forces directly to the center of mass.  Forces, similar to the force of elasticity, are applied to a certain point of the object, they will create a moment of force, therefore we consider them in the general case.  As we saw in the first article, the friction force is the same force directed in the direction opposite to the speed of the body. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can make a simple physical model that demonstrates frictional force and simply apply force to the center of mass, or you can choose which parts of the object friction forces will be applied to and can do this, which can create a moment of force acting on the object. The forces that bodies experience in collisions are a little more difficult, and we will get to know them in the next article. Forces, like a rocket engine, should be considered as forces with an application point (in this case, if one of the engines fails, you will start spinning around its axis until you adjust the steering wheel in order to balance the moment of force!). If you want something resembling gravitational rays from a UFO, then this force must be calculated as the force of gravity and not create a moment of force, or it must be applied to a certain point of the object,and will it rotate around that point while it rises up? The choice is yours.
