  <section class="page js-page"><h1>NVIDIA SHIELD</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ae9/5b5/706/ae95b5706802e86bf6c9e8edafa022d4.png"><br>  Today, the console market is already more or less settled - it has its own leaders, who divided users into several camps.  However, in addition to products from companies such as Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo, there are other consoles and various entertainment devices that might be of interest to fans of technical innovations in the gaming industry. <br><br>  Earlier this year, at CES 2013, the famous IT giant Nvidia announced its own Nvidia Shield game console, which went on sale on July 31, 2013 at a price of $ 299 (the company originally planned to set the price at $ 350, but before the release itself fell $ 50).  However, this portable console is available so far only for residents of the United States and Canada.  The expansion of the Russian market is planned no earlier than in a year. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Interesting features of Nvidia Shield </h4><br>  The new console works on Android 4.2.1, so users expect a simple and intuitive interface, which everyone has become accustomed to long ago.  Obviously, if the console is controlled by Android, it supports the entire base of games of this platform.  In addition, the console can be connected to any monitor and turn it from a mobile game console into a stationary one.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/93c/66e/081/93c66e08192b2ddae5c43609c2611f85.jpg"><br><br>  However, this is not the main thing!  The most interesting "chip" of the Shield: the ability to broadcast full-game PCs to the console via Wi-Fi.  To do this, we need a computer or laptop with a Wi-Fi module that will meet certain technical characteristics: <br><ul><li>  GeForce GTX 650 or GeForce GTX 660M for a laptop </li><li>  Intel Core i5 processor or higher (AMD support) </li><li>  RAM capacity - 4 gigabytes </li><li>  Operating system - Windows 7 </li></ul><br><br>  As shown by individual tests, this technology works quite well: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cls-XXfNmLM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255&amp;usg=ALkJrhiX2EPZgDDh6Qr-PecVfC15W7Zgcw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  So, for example, all fans of mobile games will have the opportunity to play some new Bioshock or Tomb Raider, lounging on the couch.  Another question is whether there are many such people in the world, for it is not that pleasant to prefer a full-fledged large monitor and a comfortable mouse with a keyboard. <br><br>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_Shield">Here</a> you can see the confirmed list of games for Shield. <br><br>  Technical characteristics of the device: <br><ul><li>  Processor: quad-core Tegra 4 with a frequency of 1.9GHz </li><li>  Display: five-inch IPS with a resolution of 720p (294ppi) </li><li>  Graphics: custom 72-core GeForce </li><li>  RAM: 2GB </li><li>  Permanent memory: 16GB + the ability to use microSD up to 64GB </li><li>  Interfaces: micro USB, mini HDMI output, 3.5mm headphone input, Wi-Fi </li><li>  Online services: Nvidia TegraZone, Google Play, Steam </li></ul><br><br>  Of all the features of the console, it is worth highlighting its rather impressive weight: 579 grams, rather big dimensions: 158x135x57 mm and a controversial design, which some Internet users already didn‚Äôt like.  Of the positive features - very good speakers, obviously winning in quality from most of these devices, as well as high battery capacity, allowing you to play video for a day without a break. <br><br><h4>  Purchase </h4><br>  As mentioned earlier, you can only buy Nvidia Shield in the United States and Canada. <br><br>  Console <a href="http://store.nvidia.com/buyshield">for</a> sale <a href="http://store.nvidia.com/buyshield">in the official Nvidia store</a> , as well as in NewEgg for a suggested price of $ 299.  However, both of these stores are not particularly friendly with Russian payment methods.  But you can try to specify the US billing address instead of Russian.  For this is quite suitable <a href="https://qwintry.com/ru/node/235424">address in the United States, issued by Bandera</a> .  As a delivery address, of course, you should also indicate the address in the United States, issued to you by the Parcel.  After all, the store delivers orders only within the United States and Canada. <br><br>  In addition to the device itself, in the company store you can order additional accessories to it.  For example, a good case: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cec/8f1/c4b/cec8f1c4bc8d6198989584bd93e1ff79.png"><br><br>  Delivery in the US from the official store NVIDIA paid.  Standard delivery lasts several days and costs $ 13.  Faster delivery costs more. <br><br>  Another alternative to buy is Ebay.  This is in case the trick with the American billing address still does not work and the seller cancels the order.  However, there is an extra charge for this device: if you search well, you can buy Nvidia Shield on Ebay at around $ 350. <br><br>  Now let's calculate the cost of shipping from the USA to Russia.  Together with the whole package, the device is unlikely to weigh more than a kilogram.  For a <a href="https://qwintry.com/ru/shield">parcel post, the</a> cost of delivering a package weighing 1 kg via USPS EXPRESS is $ 67.3 with all commissions.  Add insurance for $ 299 for $ 9.  Total comes to <b>$ 76.3</b> with insurance. <br><br>  Total, the device in Russia will cost us: $ 299 + $ 13 + 76.3 = <b>$ 388.3</b> .  Very good price for such an exclusive! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/189442/">https://habr.com/ru/post/189442/</a></p>
