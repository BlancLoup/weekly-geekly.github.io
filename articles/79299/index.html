  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Features of online shopping in Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For several years, more or less large goods in my family have been bought via the Internet.  The main arguments have always been: <br><ul><li>  Convenience - a couple of mouse clicks and waiting for confirmation by phone.  And the goods are already being brought to you at a convenient time. </li><li>  Cost - online stores have no cost to keep a chain of stores, so you can often buy cheaper. </li><li>  Time - no loss on a trip to the store and a long selection of goods.  Everything is at hand, in which case Yandex, Price.ru and blogs will help you find all the missing information. </li></ul><br>  It would seem that everything is fine, but over the past 2 months I have encountered some atypical amount of disgusting attitude in online stores towards customers.  I get the feeling that most companies spit on the quality of service, leaving on quantity. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And it concerns both small, medium and large stores: <br><br><h3>  Example 1 ( <i>small online store</i> ) </h3><br><h6>  Shop <a href="http://www.ital-parts.ru/">ital parts</a> </h6><br>  It was necessary to purchase a gift for friends in another city, in the form of a club frame for rooms.  Since the goods are niche, you can only buy them in one place.  The store has left a request for the framework, which on the site were available.  When ordering caused considerable surprise paid pickup (on the site declared as free).  Naturally, the framework was not available.  The store promised a framework in a few weeks, offering to monitor their appearance in the messages <strong>on the forum</strong> .  After the appearance of the goods in stock - I "sort of" agreed on self-delivery, asking specifically the question: <br><blockquote>  Hello.  Is it possible to come tomorrow beyond the framework? </blockquote><br>  To which he received the answer: <br><blockquote>  Good day! <br>  Yes, of course, come! <br>  We work from 9.30 to 18.00 </blockquote><br>  What was my surprise when I arrived at their office and found a locked door.  Calling on the phone from the company's business card, which was embedded in the file and serves as a sign, apologized to me and promised free shipping for such a misunderstanding.  After the request sent to the store to make a free delivery, specifically indicating that if it is not possible, then specify the time when I can definitely make pickup.  After a while they called me and promised to make her at a convenient time for me on the appointed day.  On the appointed day, as expected, no one called and did not deliver. <br>  There is no more desire to get involved with this store, and an acquaintance was left without a gift. <br><br><h3>  Example 2 ( <i>average online store</i> ) </h3><br><h6>  Shop <a href="http://bigtv.ru/">BIGtv.ru</a> </h6><br>  I wanted to order in this company a plasma TV.  Since he was going to place it on the wall, he also studied the range of accessories presented in the catalog.  When viewing one of the brackets, on the page the following text <br><blockquote>  WE ARE READY TO GO TO YOUR CONDITIONS! <br>  Not satisfied with the price of Benatek Plazma 4? <br>  Found a cheaper or want to get a discount? <br></blockquote><br>  And near the form of the message.  I gave links to 2-va store, where this bracket was much cheaper than in this online store and asked to give me a discount, since I was going to order another TV.  I received an answer <br><blockquote>  bracket price fixed </blockquote><br>  If a promise is made on the site, then its implementation should be at least considered, otherwise customers are lost.  For example, in my case, the TV and the bracket were purchased at another online store.

    <h3>  Example 3 ( <i>large online store</i> ) </h3><br><h6>  <a href="http://ozon.ru/">OZON</a> Store </h6><br>  The new year is approaching, and this is the time for gifts.  I have been picking up a gift for my girlfriend for a very long time.  Aby that after all you can not give a loved one.  A wonderful kaleidoscope was found in the OZON catalog, which would be a pleasant gift for my girlfriend.  And the OZON store brand itself inspired confidence.  Where, where, and here everything should be at the highest level (after all, the largest store in runet).  As a result, I ordered, and then paid for a kaleidoscope on December 21, based on the large credit of trust on my part of this company. <br>  On December 23, a text message arrived saying that my order was delivered to one of the points of issue and that I could pick it up within 10 days.  The next day, at this point of issue, having stood for an hour in the queue (the new year, as it was on the nose), it turns out that my order cannot be found.  After 10 minutes of searching, the girl on issue dragged a huge box weighing 4 kilograms (although the weight of my order is only 175 grams).  The box was not my order, but a toy fire truck ... After the box was returned, the manager grumbled under her breath that the money would be returned to the account, and she started working on other clients.  At home, by calling support, I find out that the money will be returned within 10 days after the ordered kaleidoscope is returned to the warehouse.  And considering that from 1 to 10 OZON does not work, then this will happen <strong>around January 15th</strong> .  At the same time, there were no kaleidoscopes (apparently, no one decided to make such a gift) was not in stock and there will be no supplies until January 15th.  At best, I will get the money back before the new year. <br>  Until the new year, it remains 6 days to search and order a similar gift now already past ... That's how my girlfriend was left without a unique gift for the new year.  As well as without a gift, most likely the unfortunate child, to whom the toy was intended, remained, and all because of the mistake of some OZON personnel, although there was little room for error. <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  From the foregoing, I do not understand: Is it really difficult to make a normal quality of service?  For example, you can take the FCC where you can order 3 days before the new year, and in a day they will be brought (instead of the usual the next day).  And in case of any problems (the car breaks, delivering the goods), they ring back several times.  And in the case of some more global problems (in my case, we forgot one of the goods positions in a broken car), they will recalculate the remaining positions on the go.  The chief of the online store will call with apologies, and then free of charge will deliver the missing position with checks, as 2 different orders, compensating the whole force majeure as a whole. <br><br>  I resent: as long as they make money on us without worrying about the quality of the services provided? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79299/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79299/</a></p>
