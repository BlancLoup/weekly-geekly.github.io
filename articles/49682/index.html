And we'll see. <br><br>  Brief background.  In an effort to be closer to the people, Canonical hosts <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOpenWeek">UbuntuOpenWeek</a> in the format of chat system developers with interested people.  After reading, I tried to briefly summarize the main thoughts that were touched in the live communication between the developers and the community.  Naturally, this is not a literal translation. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Noise and din in the "class" <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/openweekintrepid/KernelUpcoming">Kernel</a> .  Speaker: <a href="http://ben-collins.blogspot.com/">Ben Collins</a> . </h5><br>  The process of developing ubuntas is interesting.  Due to the fact that the git-tree ubuntu-next was created in Intrepid, we got 2.6.27 and not .26, as it should have been according to the development cycle of ubuntu.  In the normal cycle, they do not begin work on the distribution core while it is under active development.  But the advantages of .27go outweighed and we all got an improved suspend, wifi, hw support.  From the disadvantages of this approach, the presenter singled out an exception from the main tree of support for sparc and ppc platforms.  Soon their fate will be considered and maybe they will be included again.  The Jaunty will be .28, but this has not yet been decided. <br>  One of the priorities of Jaunty is the speed of loading the kernel.  Specific goals in seconds are not worth it yet, the main idea and scope for optimization activities are core modules. <br>  They also work closely with XOrg and strongly want to get a working kernel-mode-setting.  For all this entertainment with the core, Canonical has only 6 full-time nuclear developers.

      Finally, a question was asked about how soon (or far) in the future btrfs is waiting for us as the main fs.  The answer was received that not even 50-50, but 40-40.  Where are the other 20%?  The answer was witty: either ext5 will be out by that time, or Reiser will be released ... <br><br>  And this is only one meeting at ubuntu open week.  and packaging and reporting 101, reporting &amp; fixing bugs, kernel bugs, ubuntu vs debian, intrepid &amp; servers, ubuntu &amp; money. <br>  recommend! <br><br><h5>  About the relationship <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/openweekintrepid/DebianUbuntu">Debian and Ubuntu</a> .  Speaker: <a href="http://jameswestby.net/">James Westby</a> . </h5><br>  This hot English guy participates in the MOTU (Masters of the Universe) project.  The goal of the project is to support the <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/community/ubuntustory/components">Universe and Multiverse</a> repositories.  In parallel, he participates in Debian‚Äôs projects.  And this is what he told the community as part of the ubuntu open week: <br><br>  Debian is a great distribution that many people work on, including  and Shuttleworth.  When Mark created Ubuntu, he certainly looked at Debian, trying to fix a few things in it.  The differences touched org.  moments of membership in the development team and, of course, in some technical points.  The differences in the objectives of both projects allowed concentrating resources on supporting a small number of popular architectures, thereby strengthening other areas of development.  After all, the support of 11 (well, or how many official platforms does Debian have?) Requires tremendous efforts and slows down the release cycles.  The tendency in Ubuntu is to choose the best solution for a specific task that works really well, and in Debian they often try to try and maintain many solutions.  Efforts, of course, are both true, it all depends on the goals set before the distribution kit. <br>  The most important difference is that the author considers that it is much more difficult to become a member of the Debian development team, and for a non-developer it is almost impossible.  Perhaps that is why Debian is stagnating in terms of ‚Äúnon-programmer‚Äù tasks. <br>  To the question - ‚ÄúAre the Ubunthoids so harsh that if there is an alternative to Pulseaudio vs Alsa there is only one subsystem left?‚Äù gnome, xfce - no, but for MTA - yes. <br><br>  Then they quickly hushed up the rather stupid question of why Canonical was not eager to support third-party derivatives from Ubuntu and moved on to the problem of choice.  So, what's better for everyday work - A or B? <br>  The answer is not easy.  Many recommend Ubuntu to newbies because it is out of the box.  But it is best to download the live-cd of both systems and try to choose yourself. <br><br>  In terms of stability, Debian has advantages due to a more extended 18-month cycle, with stable but outdated packages.  Here is such a compromise.  Ubuntu, with his 6-month cycles, is in a hurry to bake new packages, but they also have an answer for those who like stability.  His name is LTS ... <br><br>  What does it mean to be Debian based for Ubuntu?  Did their tracks diverge after the first historical fork?  Of course not!  The start of each new release accompanies the so-called ‚Äúmerging‚Äù, the merging of the Debian and Ubuntu branches.  This process brings in Ubuntu as well as new improvements from Debian, as well as mistakes. <br><br>  Between distributions there is a mutual exchange of improvements and corrections.  Debian receives stable packages, and Ubuntu stops accompanying them and only imports them from Debian back, because they have no resources for all 15,000 packages. <br><br>  What does Ubuntu do to refute the well-established view that they give little to Debian?  Answer.  2nd things: give Debian's patches and make the process of contributing visible.  In Debian Stable, virtually nothing goes away and everything goes to Unstable, which, by the way, may be a visible factor for prosecutors who claim that Ubuntu takes a lot and gives little.  In fact, a system for tagging bugports and patches from Ubuntu has been developed, and anyone who wants can see the statistics in <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi%3Ftag%3Dorigin-ubuntu%3Busers%3Dubuntu-devel%40lists.ubuntu.com">the Debian bug</a> tracker.  We will believe in the word that they give :) <br><br>  The question of life and death - what will happen if Debian dies suddenly?  The answer was not very clear, so the question was asked again and even more insistently.  Will Ubuntu have enough developer power to start autonomous navigation with, for example, 8.10 and that's it.  Or everything is bad and the project is so dependent that it cannot be developed at least in terms of security fixes.  Answer: You need a lot of developers to release a release, but we'll see there. <br><br>  Then they praise Launchpad, praise each other for fixing bugs and ask to send fixes not only to Ubuntu, but also directly to the authors of the programs.  There is also a big request - to monitor the bugs as in Ubuntu‚Äôs bug tracker, and in Debianovsky.  They have a vision of the question that linking reports between systems is very important.  On this we wish them good luck, I hope the topic of the coexistence of Ubuntu and Debian opened up for us. <br><br>  I do not think that many have read it here, but if this is the case - thanks, leave comments and help move to the Ubuntu section. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/49682/">https://habr.com/ru/post/49682/</a></p>
