Today I want to pay attention to the opposite and return to our roots, the origins of our skills and the evolution of modern man. <br><br>  Having chosen the profession of a programmer, I uncontrollably wanted to compensate my efforts of sitting behind the code, to bring diversity into my life, to fill it with something close and pleasant.  My second hobby was fishing, namely spinning.  I have long dreamed of such days, trips to nature, to peace and quiet, where you could think about your perception, actions and plans.  In 2013, I made more than 30 nature trips to small rivers, to lakes in my area in search of a predator.  This passion is ‚Äúfrom the heart‚Äù, apparently from our roots, and I like it. <br><br>  But today, I want to write about a wonderful director, whom I was delighted with.  On Habr√© there are very few references about him, about his works and about his films.  Directed by Dmitry Vasyukov, the cycle of documentaries "Happy People".  The first films (4 episodes - spring, summer, autumn, winter) were shot in 2005 on the river.  Enisey about people who live and survive in those parts, about nature, hunting and fishing, about the harsh taiga.  In 2008, the film was seen by many, thanks to the Internet. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I found a band created by Dmitry Vasyukov on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SchastlivyelyudiHappyPeople">facebook</a> dedicated to his film series, and I‚Äôve recently opened a channel on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSgnRwJ2jYR7o_SXCwugbMQ">youtube</a> .
