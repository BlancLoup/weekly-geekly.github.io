Sharing ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Interestingly, it‚Äôs only in our situation that we constantly need people, or is it a common trend of all regional web studios ?!  There is always more work than we can do!  We constantly need people.  Adequate and inexpensive) Ads in newspapers, on forums, in institutes, calling friends and even social networks ... All of this in our region for several years almost does not bring the expected result.  What to do? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Who do we need? </h4><br>  I think that many studios will answer this question just like me.  We need adequate people who can quickly learn and implement in the production process.  To start programming websites or simple mobile applications - you do not need a lot of knowledge and skills.  With experienced full-time developers and studio standards, control and training opportunities for young people, beginners learn very quickly.  We are no longer looking for people with experience.  They have long been overbought by banks, large companies, spoiled by remote freelancing.  Yes, and to pay the salary, which is requested by ready-made specialists, is often simply not possible. <br>  Where to look for such people? <br><br>  Surprisingly, at first glance, wanting to work - no.  Announcements in institutes, bulletin boards, social networks - updated daily.  From vacancies we remove abstruse requirements, we leave only the knowledge of basic technologies.  We are luring a good salary for beginners, a good team, two monitors, fresh buns ... at least calls.  We understand that if the process of finding employees is not adjusted, then it will be hard.  The demand for such frames is growing strongly, and the demographic hole is still ahead.

    <h4>  Internship - a way that works </h4><br>  And so we accidentally discovered a way that works.  We replaced the word "Vacancy" with the word "Internship" and began to invite people to study at our company.  We offered senior students to study for a few weeks and try themselves in real projects.  For students it is free, but it was necessary to pass a rigorous selection. <br><br>  For 2 weeks we received more than 50 applications from different universities from those who want to sign up for an internship.  Over the following week, we selected 12 people, of whom we formed two groups according to the level of basic knowledge.  These were people who wanted to learn and work, having at least some kind of independent work experience (which is very valuable) and not burdened with family, children and the requirements of high salary. <br><br>  <b>What is the secret of this turn of events?</b>  Where were these people when we posted vacancies?  If we talk averaged, in my opinion, the young guys are just afraid.  They are afraid that they have no experience, they are afraid to appear weak at the interview, they are afraid that they will not cope.  This is understandable.  Most institutions do not teach modern languages, models and tools.  And to study all this while studying is often not enough time. <br><br>  When we invite for an internship, the psychological perception of where they are going changes.  People come to learn, where they will not demand a result from them, where there is no responsibility.  Naturally, only later, having tried our strength, having worked in a team, the interns have the awareness of ‚ÄúI can‚Äù, the uncertainty disappears, the desire to work appears.  And by this time they had become accustomed to the team, and learned what would be needed later in the work.  Isn't that what you need as an employer?  Choose from 12 people the most worthy and go.  The rest in the future. <br><br><h4>  Internship organization.  Our experience </h4><br>  Information about the internship posted on the website, on social networks, posted ads in the institutes and told the specialized teachers.  <a href="http://docs.google.com/document/d/1eqmBuq1B4_zL4aKiFXFd-MJznH3q6c9S1tM-OVnvPMs/edit">Sample ad</a> <br><br>  Internship program  We chose evening classes 3 times a week + practical homework.  Participants of the internship immediately warned that we will deduct for passes and failure to do homework.  <a href="http://docs.google.com/document/d/1ojwTZjLLQLtacTqE8nSQx4JZV0pLtFGsMCFAa1h73RI/edit">An example of a theoretical program for the course web development</a> <br><br>  Under each trainee they got an account in redmine, where they posted lecture materials, set assignments, monitored accomplishments and gave their comments.  Thus, the students got acquainted with our corporate project work system, and we managed to keep everything under control.  Initially, we planned that senior programmers would take on one or two students to advise on practical tasks.  But it turned out to be difficult.  More on this later ... <br><br>  We didn‚Äôt have a separate equipped room.  Therefore, for this purpose we used a negotiation.  All trainees had to be with their laptop.  This was one of the rules of admission.  We set up wifi with limited access to the studio‚Äôs online resources, and the mobile classroom was ready. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/df7/4ce/ede/df74ceede08dec8fe27422e3d9f0ed9b.jpg" alt="Internship web-canape"><br><br>  Classes were conducted by a technical director with the involvement of relevant specialists.  For this he was allowed to come to work by 12:00, as well as honor and respect) The first internship was not easy for him, because  the preparation of classes and their conduct is a very laborious matter.  Repeated courses are already easier, of course. <br><br>  At the end of the internship, students demonstrated their achievements.  Some of them completed the internship already being employees of our company.  We invited them to work with us, without waiting for the end of the course. <br><br>  Further a few conclusions over time. <br><br><h4>  Conclusions over time </h4><br>  Group internship is a good public way to attract fresh, uncorrupted human resources and identify potential employees among them. <br><br>  Despite the fact that the internship is a less profitable way of attracting new employees compared to a personal approach, it provides significant advantages. <br><br>  Free training increases the trust of candidates to the company, and work in a real infrastructure quickly plunges into a working atmosphere.  Internship is a good test for motivation and professional suitability, which can be difficult to calculate during an interview.  Moreover, we always have a choice - the opportunity to hire the best, and the less powerful and responsible to keep in reserve. <br><br>  Returning to the topic of assigning studio specialists to interns, we realized that in the period of pure (not tied to production) training, this does not make sense.  The question is not even in the elementary absence of many developers of pedagogical experience (the ability to navigate the level of someone else‚Äôs knowledge and quickly fill in the gaps in them), but that employees who work in production have no elementary experience.  The assignment of those responsible for the students is necessary already in production for the transfer of specific knowledge and experience in the implementation of tasks. <br><br>  Here is such, I hope, rewarding experience.  Ready to answer questions, and, with pleasure, we will listen to the views of users. <br><br>  Vasily Churanov and the <a href="http://www.web-canape.ru/">web-canape team</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139713/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139713/</a></p>
