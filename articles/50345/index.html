  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About computer science in general</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Authors: Vorozhtsov A.V., Vinokurov N.A. <br>  Yes, Mikhail Vasilyevich Lomonosov asks us, but let's allow ourselves to paraphrase ‚ÄúFor this reason, it is necessary to teach computer science, because it leads the mind to order‚Äù. <br>  Indeed, if you look closely at what computer science is now and try to isolate its main task, then by and large, only one thing remains - computer science teaches how to formalize entities and processes (= put your thoughts in order). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Formalization</b> is a strict description of something with a view to its use in practice. <br>  For example, a chemist creates a description of a substance in the form of a chemical formula.  According to this description, a practitioner chemist can predict the properties of a substance and construct it from ingredients. <br>  Formalization is somewhat similar to poetry.  The poet, oddly enough, driving himself into the framework of strict rules for constructing a poetic form, can express more and more convincingly than a writer a prose writer. <br>  And in computer science, the rules are even stricter.  It is required that the descriptions are understood not only by a person, but also by a mechanical device. <br><br>  In every science, they try to identify the main task.  For example, the main task of mechanics is: according to the current state of a mechanical system, determine its state after a specified period of time.  In geometry, this is the determination of the positions of points and the ratios of geometric objects from these ratios.  The task of physics is the prediction, explanation and use of physical phenomena.  The task of all mathematics is more difficult to formulate, but everything is clear with it - this is the queen of sciences, which is the fabric of all natural sciences, and above all, mathematics is an amazing world for mind games, close to poetry and visual arts.  This poetry of mathematics is the reason why we dare to replace the word in Lomonosov‚Äôs statement.

      Chemistry, biology, physics have the same task - to describe, explain, deduce laws, predict the properties (behavior) of substances, life on Earth, and the physical world, respectively. <br><br>  And what is dedicated to computer science? <br>  Informatics is a dump of the dead and the emerging technologies.  But besides this, there is in it some deep and important component that she can rightly be proud of - these are methods of formalizing and fighting with increasing complexity. <br><br>  Information became the analogue of matter in computer science - the set of bits. <br>  And just as in biology, cells are combined into tissues, tissues - into organs, and organs - into living organisms, also in computer science, ‚Äúimpersonal‚Äù bits are organized into information blocks, which in turn are combined at a new level, and so on.  As a result, the information becomes meaningful, complete form and begins to work on a person. <br><br>  A similar situation occurs with information systems (programs) that process information ‚Äî they also repeatedly transition from cells to tissues, organs, and living organisms. <br><br>  Of course, the engineer may notice that he has similar images when he thinks that the plant for the production of mineral fertilizers consists ultimately of bolts, brackets, pipes and metal plates.  But I would like to note that, in terms of the number of metasystem transitions, computer science, nevertheless, is a winner. <br><br>  While in the majority of sciences they try to construct comprehensive models, in computer science they are engaged in building models of models, developing methods for constructing models, etc. <br><br>  Apparently, the closest definition is as follows: <br><br><blockquote>  <em>Computer science is the science of methods of formalization, processing and organization of large volumes of information.</em> <em><br></em> </blockquote><br><br>  The adjective ‚Äúlarge‚Äù in this definition carries a meaning, and is not simply inserted for red word. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/50345/">https://habr.com/ru/post/50345/</a></p>
