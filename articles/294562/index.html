      <b>Reach and frequency have changed.</b> <br><br>  TV is still an excellent means of achievement, but it loses the frequency and attention of viewers.  Consumers have become multi-tasking (using other devices while watching TV), and it is easier for them to switch between tasks (sessions between switching from one device to another are very short).  This means that their attention is distracted from the TV while watching it.  Loss of frequency and attention is critical for the television industry and in areas where video is an additional resource. <br><br>  <b>Mobile devices are challenging.</b> <br><br>  Marketers have the opportunity to contact with consumers using mobile devices, allowing them to interact with advertising.  Attraction with the help of creatives can include the use of photo galleries, additional videos and work with social media channels.  Research shows that sales are growing at 6% among those consumers who interact with video advertising, and that they spend twice as much time with it than those who view static advertising. <br><br>  <b>Consumers are watching videos through multiple devices.</b> <br><br>  Consumers in general do not distinguish video content on TV or online, and you need to be prepared for the fact that in the future video will only be video, and not something big coming from the magic box.  Looking for entertainment, good sound and movement on any screen.  Do you remember when the last time your family was going to watch TV on a Saturday night?  Now it is something from the past, because the house is full of different screens - smartphones, tablets, laptops, etc., even if all family members are in the same room at the same time.  Capturing such an audience is becoming increasingly difficult for marketers, and the only way is to be everywhere where there are consumers. <br><br>  For example, the dynamic introduction of advertising during television shows.  The consumer will surely want the most suitable advertising for the content that is the main one.  And marketers will want to reach the most relevant audience. <br><br>  Thanks to the display of advertising along with suitable television content, you can not only create awareness, but also lead to intentions.  What do we mean?  For example, while watching a program on TV, on a mobile device, an advertisement that is suitable for the content is launched with a call to action. <br><br>  If we think as a consumer and use new technologies, we will create tremendous opportunities for the entire video community. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294562/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294562/</a></p>
