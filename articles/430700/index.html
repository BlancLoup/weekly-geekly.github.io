  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A unified online movie viewing system will start working in Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/045/2ca/7b4/0452ca7b40a477d8f4cf88b6608f9a2d.jpg" align="left">  Russian producers managed to achieve the transition of online cinemas to the online movie viewing system from Nielsen analytical company, as <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2018/11/21/787014-sistema-ucheta-onlain-prosmotrov">reported</a> by Vedomosti.  The transition will take place in the next few months, and it was initiated because the producers and distributors are not too happy with the quality of the data provided by online services for viewing content by users. <br><br>  The Association of Film and Television Producers (APCIT), which unites the majority of content producers in the Russian Federation, asked the Ministry of Communications for help in connection with the current situation.  On November 16, Deputy Communications Minister Alexei Volin held a meeting on this issue with media companies and online services.  The meeting was attended by such companies as STV, Art Pictures, Yellow, Black &amp; White (YBW), StarMedia, CTC Media and National Media Group holdings, Volga and Central Partnership distributors, Ivi online cinemas , Megogo, Okko and Yandex. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It should be noted that the incomes of online cinemas in Russia are constantly growing - now the growth rate is 30-40% per year.  Payments to Russian media companies at the same time grow by no more than 10% per year.  It is clear that the latter do not like it.  Three main models of monetization are used - either the purchase or ‚Äúrent‚Äù of a particular film, a series, a TV show, or a subscription payment, or a free viewing with the cinema's earnings on advertising.  The right holder receives a certain amount or receives a reward depending on the content views, new subscribers, ad impressions.  In the second case, the amount of income of the right holder depends on the statistics provided by the partners - in other words, on their honesty. <br><br>  Many producers and distributors do not trust the statistics provided by online cinemas too much.  Some companies are completely confident of hiding part of their income with Internet services.  It is for this reason that media companies have insisted that services begin to use Nielsen software.  This software platform was developed based on the solution of the Russian company Data Screen.  As for Nielsen, it is an independent analytical company that verifies the data provided - for example, through test purchases.

      Representatives of online cinemas, in turn, do not agree with the opinion of partners about their bad faith.  So far, none of the rights holders have directly accused them of theft.  However, online cinemas do not plan to provide all the data they require.  According to online cinemas, all this is commercial information that competitors can use.  Producers sometimes do not themselves understand how certain data are processed, and also underestimate the technical difficulties of collecting analytics. <br><br>  At the meeting, producers, distributors and online cinemas Ivi, Megogo and Okko reached an agreement according to which by 2019 services will begin to provide Nielsen with information on the content of companies that have agreed to this model of cooperation.  Initially, it will be only data on user payments.  Then the companies will discuss similar reporting on the subscription and advertising model.  Next, it will be a reporting system that is similar to the state system of a single film ticket operating in offline Russian cinemas. <br><br>  According to Nielsen, by the end of the year, the company plans to organize the supply of data from online cinemas, making some of the information open.  The agency has already agreed to supply data with 20 major film companies that operate in Russia, including 20th Century Fox.  In addition, there is an agreement with the studio Disney. <br><br>  It is worth recalling that on November 1, the largest Russian media companies, including television holdings and online cinemas, <a href="https://habr.com/post/428608/">signed an</a> official memorandum on combating piracy with Internet companies.  The most important point in the contract is the obligation of ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù to remove links to pages with pirated content from the results of the search results for users.  Right holders believe that piracy is the main factor that holds back the development of the online video content market. <br><br>  The copyright holders of the memorandum were signed by such companies as Channel One, VGTRK, Gazprom-Media, National Media Group, CTC Media, the Internet Video Association (combines online cinemas) and the Association of Film and Television Producers.  Internet companies that have agreed to sign the document - ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù, Mail.ru Group and Rambler Group.  The guarantor of this "deal" - Roskomnadzor. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/430700/">https://habr.com/ru/post/430700/</a></p>
