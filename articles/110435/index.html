      In general, Zyxel has 3 variants of keenetic routers: Zyxel Keenetic, Zyxel Keenetic 4G, ZyXEL Keenetic Lite. <br>  Differences in ‚Äústuffing‚Äù: Keenetic has it all, 4G has a less functional USB, and lite doesn‚Äôt have it at all. <br><br>  As it is written on the manufacturer‚Äôs website, and on the label above, this router supports wired internet connection via PPTP, L2TP, PPPoE and IPoE, as well as built-in support for 3G and 4G USB modems. <br>  At the same time, the manufacturer promises speeds of up to 70 Mbps over PPTP / L2TP and up to 90 Mbps over PPPoE, IPoE. <br>  The list of supported USB modems is on the zyxel website and it is quite large among popular models: <br>  Samsung SWC-U200 (Yota 4G), Airplus MCD-800 (Skylink CDMA) as well as the big three modems ZTE and Huawei. <br>  With all these features, the device also has a print server, support for torrents (client transmission), a 802.11n WiFi point. <br>  Also, the advantages include Link duo technology, i.e.  simultaneous access to the Internet and to the local network of the provider.  In fact, this is an analogue of Dual access technologies on Dlink and ASUS. <br><br>  On the back of the device there are 4 LAN ports, 1 WAN, a Wlan wireless network switch, a WiFi accelerated access button - WPS, and a recessed reset. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/bfcf8f7a/e0ca335a/6e2da23f/e79bec22.jpg"><br><br>  The multifunctional USB port is located on the left side, so everything is in place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/2b6444cf/5b2bc077/550c4e6b/3258ee3f.jpg"><br><br>  The web interface of the router is entirely in Russian, and is intuitive.  Also at the bottom of the device there is all the necessary information for the login to the admin panel. <br><br>  On the statistics page, all important information is immediately available, including the processor load and occupied memory, as well as the connected devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/1ad6061d/a216fed9/04d10bfc/3566e4b9.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Yota</b> <br><br>  First of all, to test the connection, we decided to try Yota modem - Samsung SWC-U200. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/0cd38780/a4b74d38/2c4328f1/3fbbad35.jpg"><br><br>  It was decided to test the speed via speedtest.net on a server in Khimki, as the most accurate one for reviews.  Result below: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a77/8df/f8d/a778dff8de54910f80f2905489b04416.png"><br>  Surely the result would have been better if the test was carried out at another time (not at 5 pm), as well as the possibility of connecting a modem through an extension cord. <br><br>  <b>3G megaphone</b> <br><br>  The modem from the megaphone also earned no problems at all, the benefit of the router is a set of settings for all major mobile operators in Moscow. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/556d3fe0/531b3f83/894a0379/91580d87.jpg"><br><br>  <b>SkyLink CDMA</b> <br><br>  The modem from Skylink (ZTE 5710) also connected without problems.  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãtest below: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b74/a72/0fb/b74a720fb4a6d7dc155c3b57d58b5ed1.png"><br><br>  Unfortunately, this device does not support 2 connections at the same time, which would be very desirable. <br>  Apparently, a backup line was not planned in devices of this class, and it should be looked for in devices of greater value, for example, DryTek vigor 2910 (~ 7000r). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/d497ea60/8871cfc0/b681fe6c/06b81391.jpg"><br><br>  Setting up a torrent and a printer in the web interface is not difficult; any user can handle it, especially since there is a detailed explanation for each menu.  When you connect a USB drive, be it a USB flash drive, or a hard disk, you can choose how access will be provided either via FTP (specifying a login password for a set of users, or anonymously), or through a regular shared folder on the Windows network (similar to indication of those who provide this access). <br><br>  Of the interesting features it can be noted that you can change the mode of operation of the WPS button to safely turn off flash drives, which can be useful if they are changed frequently, and simply for data integrity. <br><br>  It is also important to note that this unit supports IPTV when viewed on a computer or set-top box, there is also a corresponding page in the device interface. <br><br>  <b>Total</b> <br>  As a result, we can say that the Zyxel has an interesting feature set, which in many respects fits the criteria of active Internet users in Russia, while at a very attractive price, and not requiring any special knowledge to configure.  It is also worth noting that the manufacturer offers a 3 year warranty + an additional year when the device is registered on the site, which is a very impressive time for the router.  The quality of the service center is very high.  All devices delivered by us under warranty were restored within 24 hours. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110435/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110435/</a></p>
