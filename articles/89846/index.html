This is a fairly large network of computer equipment stores in the Volga region. <br>  After a couple of months, the hinge covers began to fall apart.  Within two years, these loops were repaired several times, then they fell apart again, then they were repaired again, then they fell apart again. <br>  I could not return it immediately after several months of purchase, since by law it was supposed to be a re-marriage. <br><br><h4>  Courts </h4><br>  After the third time, I came to the store and demanded to return the money to me.  There were long negotiations, then a long correspondence, which did not lead to anything.  Then I sued them.  At trial, it turned out that the firm had already closed, transferring all of its obligations to the legal successor firm.  As it turned out, this company is located in another city in the industrial zone. <br><br>  After the first trial there was a second trial, but on their own initiative.  According to the results of the second, I have to return the laptop to this company.  That is, I can not sell it, I have to give it to the bailiffs.

    <h4>  Bailiffs and Prosecutors </h4><br>  I won the trial more than a year ago, but no one was going to return my money to me.  I had to write to the prosecutor's office to stir up the bailiffs. <br><br>  And this week, the bailiffs sent me a letter - they returned the writ of execution.  They cannot return the money to me, because there is no one at the address of the successor firm. <br><br>  And another answer came from the prosecutor's office: <br>  <i>Requests made to state registration authorities.</i>  <i>According to the answer from the Federal Tax Service Inspectorate for Promyshlenny District, the debtor organization is not registered.</i>  <i>According to the responses from the RTI, the Fed, the traffic police, no property registered as Everest LLC has been identified.</i>  <i>According to the exit certificate at the address specified in the executive document, it is established that the organization at Samara, the Administrative impasse, 3 is not located.</i> <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  The pragma in which I bought a laptop is developing, it works under the same brand name, advertising is hanging all over the city.  People who sold me this laptop work there and even look good. <br><br>  52581 r.  I was not returned, ceasing enforcement proceedings, and by the decision of the second court I must return the laptop. <br><br><h4>  Afterword </h4><br>  Those who believe that all this hemorrhoids are wrong.  The whole process took almost no time and money.  Of the costs only 500 p.  on notarization of the power of attorney to the lawyer well and even lower costs for registered letters. <br>  I urge you to fight for your rights, sue, share experiences and ‚Äúglorify‚Äù such stores. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/89846/">https://habr.com/ru/post/89846/</a></p>
