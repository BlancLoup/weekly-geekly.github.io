  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Caring for users from the point of view of Nokia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It's not a secret, for quite a while I have been a fan of Nokia smarfon products.  I am satisfied with everything in them and it is a pleasure to use them;) But recently, I was faced with the following unpleasant situation, about which I want to tell you ‚Äúin two words‚Äù: <br><br>  In December 2008, the <strong>Beloved</strong> <a href="http://herurg.com/art/%3Ftag%3Dnokia-5800">Nokia 5800 XM</a> was inspired by its <strong>Beloved</strong> .  Knowing that the first firmware in Nokia‚Äôs smartphones was often buggy, they were immediately ready for trouble in using it - moreover, <a href="http://herurg.com/art/%3Fp%3D329">we were glad</a> that about most of them <a href="http://herurg.com/art/%3Fp%3D329">we were already aware of</a> (and practically nothing came out, thank God).  <a href="http://herurg.com/art/%3Fp%3D347">The data from the previous device was successfully transferred to this one</a> , after the smartphone they started to use as usual, not really installing additional software (so as not to reinstall it) - waiting for a fresh firmware.  The firmware was in the phone - the tenth (the first in the release for Russia). <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  And now, <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_nokia_5800/13908.html">there is information about the appearance of the 11th firmware</a> .  Class, I think, we are her ... Fucking!  NSU sniffs quietly in the corner and does not answer questions, the update ‚Äúover the air‚Äù (FOTA) also smokes bamboo.  Considering that I still do not suffer from marasmus, we started to find out what the matter was and it turned out that <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A4577224">there was no firmware</a> for our smart with product code <strong>0574888</strong> , but for " <em>not ours</em> " from <strong>0559245</strong> - <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_nokia_5800/13908.html%3Fthread%3D97876">there is</a> !  And both models are ‚Äúwhite‚Äù (with certificates and te.pe).  Okay, I think, not for the first time, Nokia already uses different product codes for the same models - maybe it wasn‚Äôt updated on the server‚Äôs firmware.  Let's wait until they update ... 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Then somehow I started to work - I did not check the output of the firmware.  And here, yesterday, I find out that the <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_nokia_5800/18188.html">20th firmware</a> has already been <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_nokia_5800/18188.html">released</a> , and is available for ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù models!  Yes, and so many delicacies in the nui ... OGO, I think, SHAKE - schA-schA will update our beloved friend ... You will not believe it - AGAIN BUTTER;) There is already a suspicion turned into confidence that our smart with product code <strong>0574888</strong> simply "forgot" for some reason, include in the list of updated.  <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_nokia_5800/18188.html">Selective survey</a> again confirmed my concerns - the devices from <strong>0559245</strong> and <strong>0559950 were</strong> perfectly updated to the twentieth.  True tovarisch with <strong>0559950</strong> lost the Russian language after the firmware, although he claims that the body is absolutely legal and donated to it by Nokia itself.  Miracles, and only - this is all strange. <br><br>  But, cynically, I am not interested in this in the first place (forgive me;)) - I wonder why our device is not being updated.  And today, at 11:30, I make a phone call right into the head of an unhappy girl from <a href="http://www.nokia.ru/support/contact-us">Nokia Care</a> support.  Why unhappy, you ask?  Yes, because she was already frankly <em>pissed off</em> with people like me with the same questions, ‚Äú <em>but pachimu at mine wasn‚Äôt schiezza, and Vasya from the side of the padout-breech was curved</em> .‚Äù  As a result of a short dialogue, I learned the following: <br><blockquote>  1. Nokia is aware that " <em>some models</em> " are not updated via the Internet and through the air (wow - yes, they knew!) <br>  2. It is recommended to roll in the SC and upgrade there (yep, go, stand in line, wait a week ...) <br>  3. They (Nokia) do nothing in Sliah - I quote: " <em>Probably, our technical specialists for some reason [!] Did not include your product code in the outgoing update</em> " (yopta, why is this ???) <br>  4. To the question " <em>when correct</em> " the answer is " <em>do not know</em> " (no comments) <br>  5. To the question " <em>who knows</em> " the answer is " <em>I do not know</em> " (no comments) <br>  6. To the question " <em>with whom should I contact, so that the situation was corrected</em> " answer " <em>on the English page of the Nokia site, you can write a technical letter to the technical staff and they can be answered [!]</em> ‚Äù (Fill in the answer!) </blockquote><br><br>  And Cho, famously, Nokia threw a third (three product codes allocated) of its Russian users.  I want to understand - why should I shove in the SC, if there is a wonderful update service at home in a relaxed atmosphere while drinking piffko?  I also want to understand why I, as an honest user, who bought the ‚Äúwhite‚Äù device and overpaid for it the N-th number of thousand rubles is discriminated against against the devices of the ‚Äúgray‚Äù import and some other honest users? <br><br>  If the representative of Nokia, monitoring blogs, notice this my writings - really want to hear a comment.  Especially considering that the crisis and the need to somehow (probably) keep their customer base (current and potential).  Anticipating some questions, I‚Äôll tell you right away: if a girl from <a href="http://www.nokia.ru/support/contact-us">Nokia Care would</a> competently answer all my questions and was ready to explain to me why I should ‚Äúwait‚Äù for my firmware, this post simply would not exist.  But vague arguments in the style of " <em>I do not know</em> " from the official representative of the company - this is too much! <br><br>  PS: I don‚Äôt mind if you fully or by reference distribute this message on mobile conferences and communities dedicated to Nokia in general and to the 5800 model in particular - the maximum number of people should know that Nokia no longer cares about its users as much as before. ‚ÄúThrow‚Äù them according to their vague whims or ‚Äúforgetfulness‚Äù of some specialists there.  Thank you all for your attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51576/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51576/</a></p>
