Although the event is conducted by <strong>Microsoft</strong> , there will be a place on MIX for presentations and presentations by independent experts from different companies and on different topics: Ruby, Python, SVG, HTML5, oData, jQuery.  A large number of reports devoted to UX. <br><br>  For example, <strong>Molly Holzschlag</strong> from <strong>Opera Software</strong> , which the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Holzschlag">Wiki calls</a> one of the most influential women on the Web, will read two lectures on open standards and <strong>HTML5</strong> .  <strong>John Resig</strong> will tell about <strong>jQuery</strong> , <strong>Miguel de Icaza</strong> about the open-source project <strong>Mono</strong> .  Dozens of other independent speakers will share their knowledge and thoughts.  About the report-discussion, in which representatives of Google, Twitter, Facebook and Microsoft will participate, read below.

      Some time before the start of MIX, data and information about new technologies began to leak into the network.  For example, the final version of <strong>ASP.NET MVC 2</strong> became available.  And before that, they talked a bit about the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/synergist/archive/2010/03/10/the-microsoft-silverlight-analytics-framework-at-mix.aspx">Silverlight Analytics Framework</a> opensource-project. <br><br>  Next, I will try to cover the reports and try to understand what awaits us on MIX'10.  A complete list of sessions with search, filter, descriptions of each can be <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/Sessions">found here</a> . <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  <strong>Open standards</strong> </h3><br>  Web and open standards are two inseparable things.  Therefore, there are many sessions on MIX on that topic.  As I already wrote, Molly Holzschlag will read a two-part report on HTML5.  <strong>Miguel de Icaza</strong> from <strong>Novel</strong> will talk about the open source project <strong>Mono</strong> .  Participants and experts from <strong>W3C Doug Schepers and Patrick Dengler</strong> will talk about the <strong>SVG</strong> standard.  Several reports are devoted to the new open standard for accessing data <strong>oData</strong> . <br><ul><li>  HTML5 Now: The Future of Web Markup Today </li><li>  The mono project </li><li>  OData: there's a feed for that </li><li>  Implementing OData: How to Create a Feed for That </li><li>  Improving the usability and security of OpenID </li><li>  Cross-Browser Best Practices </li><li>  SVG: The Past, The Present and the Future of Vector Graphics </li><li>  Participate in the Web of Open Standards </li></ul><br><h3>  <strong>Ux</strong> </h3><br>  A huge stack of reports is devoted to such a neutral topic as User Experience (UX).  Dozens of speakers from various companies will talk about their vision of UX problems and solutions.  Do not miss the report of <strong>Bill Buxton</strong> 's <strong>An Hour With Bill Buxton</strong> , who <a href="http://images.businessweek.com/ss/10/02/0201_worlds_most_influential_designers/5.htm">is called</a> one of the most influential designers. <br><ul><li>  Design Fundamentals for Developers (and Other Non-Designers) </li><li>  Design Tools and Techniques </li><li>  Great User Experiences: Seamlessly Blending Technology and Design </li><li>  Designing Rich Experiences for Data-Centric Applications </li><li>  Total experience design </li><li>  The Art, Technology and Science of Reading </li><li>  Practical Strategies for Debugging Cross-Browser Display Issues </li><li>  10 Ways to Attack a Design Problem and Come Out Winning </li><li>  Touch in Public: Multi-touch Interaction Design for Kiosks and Architectural Experiences </li><li>  Service Design Goes Social </li><li>  Creating Great Experiences through Collaboration </li><li>  Total Experience: A Design Methodology for Agencies </li><li>  The elephant in the room </li><li>  <strong>An Hour With Bill Buxton</strong> </li><li>  Modern Web Form Design </li><li>  The Laws of User Experience </li><li>  The type we want </li><li>  Design the Ordinary, Like the Fixie </li><li>  Lifecycle of a wireframe </li><li>  The Democratization of the Design Industry </li><li>  Treat Your Content Right </li><li>  Running with Wireframes: Taking Information Architecture (IA) into Design </li><li>  Microsoft Surface Goes Social: Research Project at the University of Linz </li><li>  Peanut Butter and Jelly: Putting 'Content Management' Back into Context </li><li>  From Comp to Code: A Design Communion </li></ul><br><h3>  <strong>Ruby, Python, PHP</strong> </h3><br>  Several MIX sessions will be devoted to Ruby, Pyhton, PHP.  They will tell you how to host applications in the cloud of PHP and Ruby On Rails. <br><ul><li>  Quickly Implementing New Cross-Browser Features with Ruby and Python </li><li>  Using Ruby on Rails to Build Windows Azure Applications </li><li>  IronRuby for the .NET Developer </li><li>  Pumping "Iron" on the Web: IronRuby and IronPython </li><li>  Building PHP Applications using the Windows Azure Platform </li></ul><br><h3>  <strong>jQuery</strong> </h3><br>  <strong>jQuery</strong> is a favorite library of many, got its portion of attention on MIX'10.  We are waiting for three interesting reports, including the report of <strong>John Resig himself</strong> , the creator of the library - <strong>How jQuery Makes Hard Things Simple</strong> .  Do not miss! <br><ul><li>  Six Things Every jQuery Developer Must Know </li><li>  <strong>How jQuery Makes Hard Things Simple</strong> </li><li>  Building a Next-Generation Web Application with Microsoft ASP.NET MVC 2 and jQuery </li></ul><br><h3>  <strong>Cloud computing</strong> </h3><br>  Much of the reports on MIX will be devoted to the topic of cloud computing.  This topic is becoming increasingly relevant.  And it is believed that Cloud Computing will change the way of working with computers and programs in the next few years.  In no case do not miss the report-discussion <b>Building Platforms and Applications for the Real-Time Web</b> , which will be attended by <b>Dare Obasanjo (Microsoft), Ari Steinberg (Facebook), Brett Slatkin (Google), Chris Saad (JS-Kit), Lili Cheng (Microsoft) and Ryan Sarver (Twitter).</b> <br><ul><li>  Cloud Computing Economies of Scale </li><li>  Building Cloud Services with Windows Azure Platform </li><li>  Building Offline Web Apps Using Microsoft Sync Framework </li><li>  Storm Clouds: What to Consider About Privacy Before Writing a Line of Code </li><li>  Designing and Delivering Scalable and Resilient Web Services </li><li>  Opening Up Opportunity with Twitter </li><li>  Lap around the Windows Azure Platform </li><li>  Copyright: A Cloudy Subject </li><li>  Building and Deploying Windows Azure-Based Applications with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 </li><li>  Microsoft Project Code Name "Dallas": Data For Your Apps </li><li>  Building Facebook Apps with Microsoft .NET and Deploying to Windows Azure </li><li>  <b>Building Platforms for Real-Time Web</b> </li><li>  Using Storage in the Windows Azure Platform </li><li>  Building Web Applications with Windows Azure Storage </li><li>  Adding the "Where" to the "When" of Social Applications </li><li>  Building Web Applications with Microsoft SQL Azure </li><li>  Connecting Your Applications with Windows Azure AppFabric </li><li>  Microsoft Silverlight and Windows Azure: A Match Made for the Web </li></ul><br><h3>  <strong>Windows Phone 7</strong> </h3><br>  Probably for many the most intriguing part of MIX'10 is the detailed story about the long-awaited update of the Windows Phone platform.  About Windows Phone 7 will tell a lot and detail.  More than 10 reports, including topics about the development of 3D-games, building applications using Silverlight and others.  And most importantly - a description of the capabilities of the new platform.  Look forward to. <br><ul><li>  Changing our Game - an Introduction to Windows Phone 7 Series </li><li>  <strong>Overview of the Windows Phone 7 Series Application Platform</strong> </li><li>  Windows Phone UI and Design Language </li><li>  Building Windows Phone Applications with Silverlight </li><li>  Windows Phone Application Platform Architecture </li><li>  Silverlight Performance on Windows Phone </li><li>  Development and Debugging Tools for Building XNA Games for Windows Phone </li><li>  Windows Phone Applications and Games Distributing and Monetizing </li><li>  Building Windows Phone Games </li><li>  Building a High Performance 3D Game for Windows Phone </li><li>  Designing and Developing for the Rich Mobile Web </li></ul><br><h3>  <strong>Silverlight</strong> </h3><br>  The RIA theme is becoming increasingly relevant.  Silverlight 4 - offers a complete solution to the problem of building rich applications in the web.  Both for entertainment projects and video broadcasts, as well as for serious business applications.  Not surprisingly, Silverlight will become an important part of MIX'10 - the fourth part of which is about to be released in its final form.  We are waiting for the release of a new version of SL4 during the conference and new versions of tools for working with it. <br><ul><li>  Microsoft Silverlight 4 Boot Camp </li><li>  Syncing Audio, Video and Animations in Microsoft Silverlight Applications </li><li>  Microsoft Silverlight 4 Overview: What's in Store for Silverlight 4? </li><li>  Authoring for Microsoft Silverlight 4 with Microsoft Expression Blend </li><li>  The Microsoft Silverlight Analytics Framework </li><li>  Using Windows Identity Foundation for Creating Identity-Driven Experiences in Microsoft Silverlight </li><li>  Stepping Outside the Browser with Microsoft Silverlight 4 </li><li>  Building the eBay 2 Minute Lister with Silverlight </li><li>  Microsost Silverlight 4 Business Applications </li><li>  Microsoft Silverlight </li><li>  Debugging Microsoft Silverlight Applications </li><li>  Introducing the Silverlight Rough Cut Editor </li><li>  Developing with WCF RIA Services Quickly and Effectively </li><li>  Unit Testing Silverlight and Windows Phone Applications </li><li>  Building an Accessible Microsoft Silverlight Experience </li><li>  Securing Microsoft Silverlight Applications </li><li>  Microsoft Silverlight Optimization and Extensibility with MEF </li><li>  Principles of Microsoft Silverlight Graphics and Animation </li><li>  Developing Multiplayer Games with Microsoft Silverlight 4 </li><li>  Flash Skills Applied to Microsoft Silverlight Design and Development </li><li>  Developing Natural User Interfaces with Microsoft Silverlight and WPF 4 Touch </li><li>  Building Large-Scale, Data-Centric Applications with Silverlight </li><li>  Search Engine Optimization for Microsoft Silverlight </li><li>  Accessing Web Services in Microsoft Silverlight </li><li>  Building Finance Applications with Microsoft Silverlight 4 </li><li>  Creating Effective Info Viz in Microsoft Silverlight </li><li>  An Enterprise Perspective on Silverlight 4 </li><li>  Tips and Tricks for Making Web Forms Shine with Microsoft ASP.NET 4 </li></ul><br><h3>  <strong>Internet Explorer 9</strong> </h3><br>  Another central topic of the conference should be information about <strong>Internet Explorer 9</strong> .  IE9 is expected to learn how to support SVG, get new HTML5 and CSS3 features.  In IE9, GPU-accelerated text and graphics will appear.  Developer Tool Developer Tools will be updated.  We are waiting with interest, probably during the conference will be released the public version of IE9 CTP. <br><ul><li>  In-Depth Look at Internet Explorer 9 </li><li>  High Performance Best Practices for Web Sites </li><li>  Internet Explorer Developer Tools </li></ul><br><h3>  <strong>.NET, ASP.NET, MVC</strong> </h3><br>  Judging by the vector of Web development by the number of reports, it can be concluded that traditional tools are receding into the background, and cloud computing and RIA are coming to the fore.  However, it is still very early to write off traditional web application development tools.  On MIX'10, there are dozens of reports on ASP.NET, including a new version of ASP.NET MVC 2. We‚Äôll pay attention to the report from Phil Haak and Scott Henselman, which Phil will try to crack the code. on MVC 2, which will write Scott. <br><ul><li>  Microsoft ASP.NET MVC Boot Camp </li><li>  Beyond File |  New Company: From Cheesy Sample to Social Platform </li><li>  Robots at MySpace: Massive Scaling a .NET Website with the Microsoft Robotic Studio </li><li>  What's New in Microsoft ASP.NET MVC 2 </li><li>  <strong>The HaaHa Show: Microsoft ASP.NET MVC Security with Haack and Hanselman</strong> </li><li>  Driving Experiences via Services Using the Microsoft .NET Framework </li><li>  Accessing Data in a Microsoft .NET-Connected Web Application </li><li>  Building Great Standards-Based Websites for the Big Wide World with Microsoft ASP.NET 4 </li><li>  Web Deployment Made Awesome: If You‚Äôre Using XCopy, You're Doing It Wrong </li><li>  Improving Software for the Modern Web </li><li>  The OpenRasta Framework for Building RESTful Applications </li></ul><br>
<h3>  <strong>Labs, New tech, Tools</strong> </h3><br>  A small part of the conference will take the reports on the experimental developments, which are developed in Microsoft.  For example, Pivot is an extremely interesting project on data visualization and a new understanding of working with them.  Another talk from functional programming guru <strong>Erik Meijer is</strong> about reactive extensions for JavaScript ‚Äî highly recommended.  At the conference will also present an open project CMS <strong>Orchard</strong> . <br><ul><li>  Building Pivot Collections </li><li>  Do You Speak My Language?  Unleashing the Power of Microsoft Translator </li><li>  Incarnate: Behind the Scenes </li><li>  Designing Bing: Heart and Science </li><li>  Advanced Web Debugging with Fiddler </li><li>  Deep Dive into Orchard Extensibility for CMS Developers </li><li>  <strong>Reactive Extensions for JavaScript</strong> </li><li>  Software and Web Entrepreneurs: Go Big with BizSpark and WebsiteSpark </li></ul><br><h3>  <strong>More</strong> </h3><br>  If the above listed did not help you much, then here are more topics to be covered during the conference: <br><br><h4>  <strong>Media</strong> </h4><br><ul><li>  Media Processing Workflow </li><li>  Microsoft Silverlight "Media": Moving at 60fps </li><li>  Smooth Streaming Live in HD: From Camera to Screen </li><li>  Smooth Streaming Live in HD: 2010 Olympic Winter Games </li><li>  Unlocking Audio / Video Content with Speech Recognition </li></ul><br><h4>  <strong>Windows 7</strong> </h4><br><ul><li>  Building Innovative Windows Client Software </li></ul><br><h4>  <strong>Patterns</strong> </h4><br><ul><li>  Understanding the Model-View-ViewModel Pattern </li><li>  Build Your Own MVVM Framework </li></ul><br><h4>  <strong>Design</strong> </h4><br><ul><li>  A Case Study: Rapid WordPress Design and Prototyping with Expression Web 3 </li><li>  Dynamic Layout and Transitions for Microsoft Silverlight 4 with Microsoft Expression Blend </li><li>  Microsoft Silverlight 4 Applications with Microsoft Expression SketchFlow </li></ul><br><h4>  <strong>SharePoint</strong> </h4><br><ul><li>  Designing Corporate Web Sites using SharePoint 2010 </li><li>  Building Rich and Interactive Experiments in SharePoint </li><li>  Designing an Internet-Facing Web Site Using SharePoint 2010 </li></ul><br><h3>  <strong>Discussion</strong> </h3><br>  Well, I propose to proceed to the discussion.  What do you expect most from the conference: the announcement of WP7 or details about IE9?  What reports interest you?  What topics seemed important, which - not very?  Share in the comments. <br><br> <a href="http://progg.ru/%25D0%2592-%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8-MIX10-%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2588%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7%25D1%258B-Microsoft-%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2585%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580"><img alt="Progg it" src="http://progg.ru/image.axd?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhabrahabr.ru%2Fblogs%2Fmicrosoft%2F87236%2F"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87236/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87236/</a></p>
