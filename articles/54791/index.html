  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Reflections on the project "Year of Youth"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So, my acquaintance with this project began with watching a video about a year of youth that for some reason was later called ‚ÄúForbidden Advertising for the Year of Youth‚Äù, which forbade why and why I don‚Äôt know (it would be interesting to know).  After watching the video, honestly I didn‚Äôt want to visit the site of the project, well, yes, the pathetic video, yes, I agree with many things, but I didn‚Äôt have any desire and decided to forget about this material. <br><br>  A little later, I met a friend, and he told me that he was registered on the project website and that he liked the idea, and he tries to take a more or less active part in the project.  He also offered me to register by his link.  Then I became interested much more than last time with this project and decided nevertheless to visit the site. <br><br>  The site is very well done and even beautiful.  The site contains news and other information.  But the most interesting is their several projects there, and even from time to time new ones appear.  I will not list the projects themselves; anyone can look at them on <a href="http://project.godmol.ru/">the project website</a> with a detailed description.  In the descriptions, by the way, the most interesting thing there is a lot of pathos and reality, with most of everything said, I agree.  After registration and in any of the projects, a ‚Äúpersonal account‚Äù with a list of tasks becomes available.  In other words, participation in a project resembles a game, you have a list of tasks (they are called missions) for the fulfillment of which a rating is issued, etc.  In general, the idea is good and allows at least how to organize and unite the youth.  But there are certainly disadvantages: the site is not always very convenient to use and transparent, for example, there is no function in the settings to change the project. You must write to the project manager or to technical support.

      In general, what is everything said here.  Yes, the project is undoubtedly worth the attention of young people and is very interesting, but still I have some questions: <br><br>  1. How effective will this project be and be able to help self-actualize young people today?  Or it will remain such a kind of game that does not lead to anything good, and even worse, having played it all will be forgotten about it over time. <br>  2. Within the framework of the project, all possible conferences, forums, meetings, etc. will be established.  But again, almost all of these events are held in major cities in the European part of the country.  But what about the hinterland?  Where are also a lot of young people. <br>  3. The project is supported by the government, as many know it has become famous for kickbacks and other crap.  Would not there be such cases in the project "Year of Youth"? <br>  4. Is the project aimed at youth development in general, or is it just some kind of imitation of activity?  Like, look, we do something for you. <br><br>  It would be very interesting to hear the opinion on the project as a whole. <br><br>  Actually the video itself: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/c1wT5yfNo8U&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhh7ICf_GUJ2vY3w4xjOkhYgOApUuw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/54791/">https://habr.com/ru/post/54791/</a></p>
