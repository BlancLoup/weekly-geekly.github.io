  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Service anonymous blog "Something like this ..." - rethinking and work on the bugs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6af/fe4/436/6affe44364134742a58582320a7d54dc" alt="image"><br>  About a month ago we launched Kak2tak.tk, which was already <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/272566/">written</a> on GT. <br>  After replacing the three hosters, the project finally worked steadily, and users delight us with feedback. <br>  Thanks to this, finally, you can answer the question - what have we created.  The original wording <i>‚ÄúForum is not a forum, a blog is not a blog, it doesn‚Äôt look like a social network ...‚Äù</i> has undergone some changes ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>UPD: In the evening of 26/04 was habraeffekt.</b>  <b>Thank you all for the load testing!</b>  <b>27/04 in the morning - normal flight (but they began to fumble in their pockets in search of money for an advanced hosting tariff plan).</b> <br><br>  Thinking of rethinking came from critical reviews.  Which (if you consider the service something akin to a forum) were completely fair. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt there a tree of comments?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhy do I need a captcha for each post or comment?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhy are there no instant notifications about commenting?‚Äù ... really, all these things add comfort when communicating.  But the point is that we did not strive (and do not strive) to create a forum or instant messenger.  The closest analogue of "Something like this ..." is in the offline world and is a fence on which any anonymous author can write "King is naked" or "Anya is a fool."  Sometimes along with such inscriptions there are comments ‚ÄúThis is for sure‚Äù or ‚ÄúFool himself‚Äù, but, you see, the main thing here is the starting topic.

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      So in our service, the emphasis is on the original message.  A person wants to anonymously tell something to the world (or non-anonymously, but to a limited group of citizens) - and does this in two clicks.  And comments - this is secondary.  That is why conveniences like tree comments, notifications on a smartphone or a mobile application were not originally planned.  Therefore, the general answer to all users who sent feedback: ‚ÄúThis is not a bug, but a feature.  And thanks for the feedback. ‚Äù <br><br>  But there is one request that we have seriously thought about.  This, forgive hospadi, pictures.  As you remember, initially it was (and is) placed on the ‚Äúwordiness‚Äù of the service, the URL in the message can only be placed inactive, there are no emoticons, and all the fun is bold, yes italics, and underscore.  On this we stood and will stand.  But the pictures have become a stumbling block.  Undoubtedly, you can put something like &lt;domenname.net/picture2329784.jpg&gt; in the body of the message and, ultimately, share the image.  Moreover, installing text-link browser extensions will make it even more comfortable to read a message with hyperlinks.  But we remember that our main person is the author of the message.  And he, the poor, will have to first go to some picture-hosting service, upload his image there, get a link, copy it to the clipboard and paste it into a message on Kak2tak.tk.  A chore?  We think so.  Therefore, the ‚Äúsmoke API imgurl‚Äù item was included in the todo list.  It will work like this: on the message creation page on the right there will be a photo upload button.  It will be uploaded to imgurl, and a direct link to the picture will appear here, which should be inserted into the message.  That is, embedded-media as it was not, and will not, but now place a link to the image will be easier. <br><br>  Actually, about this and the survey. <br><br>  Thanks for the comments and attention! <br><br>  PS Above the renaming of the service in the ‚ÄúAnonymous fence for the inscriptions‚Äú Something like that ... ‚Äù‚Äù we are currently thinking. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/393531/">https://habr.com/ru/post/393531/</a></p>
