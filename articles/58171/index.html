      Participation in such a tender will cost you time spent, nerves, strength, and even various other troubles (a lot of money). <br><br>  Today I will talk about how to recognize the tender, in which it is not worth participating, and about the “technologies” used by the budget sawyers. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Technology one: roll-back office, or a large sawmill </h2><br>  There are companies that have long and firmly specialized in “winning” tenders and mastering budgets.  The business process in the rollback office is simple: we know the right people, agree on the "winning" of the tender, they - roll back, we - the profits, and order the site from the very cheapest "developers". <br><br>  Why, with such huge budgets that are allocated to state sites, their quality is so sad?  Why not afford a normal developer?  First, a rollback to an official in such transactions can take up both 30, and 50, and 70 percent of the budget (the farther south, the more).  Secondly, the owners greed of the roll-office. <br><br>  Now you understand why on one very well-known portal, which still had “RAID burned down,” pieces of the site were loaded from the server of the “Association of young programmers in Bulbulistan”?  ;-) <br><br>  The main capital of such offices is communications with officials.  CEOs constantly hang out with the "right people", and relatively high patrons (some may even issue a state award) allow them to feel confident. <br><br><h2>  Technology Two: Pocket Firm, or Two-Handed Saw </h2><br>  Not every official has connections with a major pullback office.  And large rollback offices with serious patrons not every budget will agree to master. <br>  Therefore, many people do this: they start their own pocket-sized company (as an option, through a legal entity of friends or relatives), and they merge orders there.  And the orders are very different - from the manufacture of the site to the supply of office supplies. <br><br>  Then everything, as in the first version: the developers are cheaper - in your pocket more. <br><br><h2>  But what about the result, you ask? </h2><br>  Yes, of course, there is a technical task, there are some quality criteria.  But this does not prevent sawing loot and not be afraid. <br><br>  Firstly, in the case of a large kickback office, there are quite high patrons (remember, some may even hang a state award).  Always otmazhut.  If in a civilized country, an excuse about a “burned-out RAID” would not have been done, “then in our country - even things did not open. <br><br>  Secondly, who can check the quality level of the product and its compliance with the TK?  The one who takes the work.  And who takes the work?  That's right, the beneficiary and initiator of the cut. <br><br>  And so if there are conditions in the tender about “supporting the site” or there “making and placing a video in support” - this “support” and other “works” will not (this is simply unprofitable, done only to sift out competitors), and for their absence - no one will ask. <br><br>  The patronage of "big men" and the lack of mechanisms for independent control over the results of tenders makes these variegated sawing units very difficult to heat up. <br><br><h2>  Surely normal developers can not win? </h2><br>  They can, but only in a fair tender.  If the tender is known to be “sawing”, there is a multi-stage scheme for screening out unnecessary competitors. <br><br><h2>  Defense against unnecessary competitors </h2><br>  First, most studios can be eliminated by some formal criterion.  For example, if the sawing office “works on the market” for 5 years, and the turnover (not surprisingly, the state budget will have a turnover on cutting the state budget), for example, 20 million tugriks, then the requirements will be stated. <br><br>  Another criterion that people like to use is “experience in working with authorities”.  It goes without saying that the sawing companies, which specialize only on this, have such an “experience”. <br><br>  A couple of times I came across "technical tasks" in which it was required to ensure the operation of the site on a certain "system", and this "system" was nothing more than its own closed development of the office under which the tender was "sharpened". <br><br>  Another trick is obviously unprofitable conditions.  You will be offered to “maintain the site” for a year, fill it with content, etc.  If you do it conscientiously and qualitatively - hiring photographers, writers, journalists, proofreaders, content managers, then such “support” will devour the entire margin.  But remember who checks the result?  The initiator of the cut.  An office that “wins” in such a tender will not be engaged in any “site support”.  They planted a free student intern for the view, that's all.  It goes without saying that the haul-offers themselves will not complain about the quality of such “services”. <br><br>  Another favorite feature is to “wrap” the basic budget for developing a site into a wrapper from other “requirements”.  Let's say you are creating websites.  Specialize in this.  Why allow you to participate in the tender?  They add to the lot something that you don’t exactly specialize in (but what the sawing machine will be ready for): for example, make a video, make brochures, carry out “marketing research”, provide editorial support. <br><br>  Even if you try to find subcontractors and not lose all your margins (see above), you will be refused for formal reasons.  For example, these activities are not spelled out in your constituent documents. <br>  If you break through these barriers, be prepared for "friendly advice", and if you don’t hear them, you will be prepared for "unscheduled checks" and other troubles. <br><br><h2>  How to recognize a pre-lost tender </h2><br>  First, large rollback offices in each branch are known in advance.  They exist on a national scale, and in the city. <br><br>  If you see that such a sawmill is involved in the tender, then, most likely, a tender was made for it.  To participate in such a tender, of course, you can.  But, having prepared a detailed proposal and a set of accompanying documentation for 300 pages, stitched and printed, you risk finding your proposal rejected with the wording “dumping”. <br><br>  So it was, when in one of the previous firms in which I worked, we tried to participate in a big tender.  Our price offer was 15% cheaper.  A little later, colleagues from another company, who almost got involved in this hopeless enterprise, said that they were “secretly advised not to participate.” <br><br><h2>  Analyzing TK </h2><br>  If you see that in the technical specifications for the development of the site there are extraneous works (such as making a newspaper publishing the materials of the site) or the requirement of some very special technologies belonging to a particular office, consider whether it is worth investing time, effort and nerves in such a tender. <br><br>  <a href="http://blog.studiomade.ru/articles/business/pilorama/">***</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/58171/">https://habr.com/ru/post/58171/</a></p>
