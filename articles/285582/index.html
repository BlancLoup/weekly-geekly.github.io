  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Reflections on the staffing situation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Somewhat briefly - thoughts about what is happening in the Russian IT processes, from the personnel side, as I see them myself. <br><br>  First the current situation. <br>  Now we have an <b>overheated labor market</b> : there is much more work than there are specialists available.  Hence, active hunting and some wage growth (strongly depends on the specific region and specialty, of course). <br><br>  Now look at what happens in education. <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/150403/">30% of students chose an IT specialty in 2012</a> (I wonder what 2013 statistics will show). <br>  <b>IT as a whole has become ‚Äúfashionable‚Äù</b> , as it used to be with economists and lawyers. <br>  Why did graduates choose IT?  Apparently, as something that is "interesting, promising, innovative."  In addition, people go where the money is, parents say to the children - go there, you will always have money. <br>  IT works as a ‚Äúsocial elevator‚Äù - it provides an opportunity, if desired, and if you have the ability to ascend to higher spheres, without having the money and the right connections. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But back to education. <br>  I remember myself in the first year (20 years ago) - then, in our group, in 15 people, we dropped out a little, the same thing happened in the neighboring groups.  For a couple of years in the mathematical special group there are two people left.  Those.  In the first years, teachers were consciously ‚Äúcleaned‚Äù; among the students there remained those who are willing and able to learn. <br>  Universities now cannot afford to arrange ‚Äúcleansing‚Äù, sifting out students and improving quality: the approach to funding has changed, the nature of training has been forced to change with it. <br>  As a result - a further decline in the quality of training.

      Another side of the issue. <br>  Overheated market leads to the fact that there is a transition in IT people from other specialties.  This is not bad and not good, this process has always been and is, but in the current conditions it is intensifying. <br><br>  What does all this mean for us, those who are now working in IT? <br>  In general, as a result of the popularity of the direction, in 2-3 years we will get <b>much more young specialists at the entrance</b> - for the industry as a whole, this is good, filling the labor market with people should slow down the growth of wages. <br>  I hope that this will allow Russian IT to remain in a profitable zone in relation to competitors in the global market. <br><br>  The change in quantity will occur in parallel with the fall in the level of training of specialists "at the entrance" - it falls and will continue to fall. <br>  Companies have to build the process of training specialists, create and develop ‚Äútraining centers‚Äù. <br><br>  Along with all this, we will also get a <b>change in the motivation of specialists</b> : if earlier in IT there were those for whom this is really a ‚Äúvocation‚Äù, for whom this is really necessary, then now the motives are somewhat different. <br>  It becomes less self-motivated, more focus on money, position and other benefits. <br><br>  For the increasing flow of new "junior" will need to lead. <br>  Those who are now in the positions of "middles" should pay attention to the development of "soft skills" - people management, peopleware - soon they will find application. <br>  Of course, among the "new shift" there will be those who want to quickly grow into leads and managers without having the baggage of technical knowledge, which is fraught with a crisis of confidence. <br><br>  And last but not least, this factor can negate the whole increase. <br>  We are overtaken by the ‚Äúdemographic hole‚Äù of the 1990s, when the birth rate dropped dramatically (at least in 1998).  In IT, working age begins in the course of studying at a university - at about 20 years.  It turns out that the impact of this fall, we are already beginning to feel, and the peak falls around 2018. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b2f/86a/aa8/b2f86aaa8d7651c1c35d865d9f6268b4.png"><br><br>  In general, the situation with personnel certainly changes, whether it is good or bad - time will show. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285582/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285582/</a></p>
