Neurotechnology is also used in the military sector, the gaming industry (complexes for the development of cognitive abilities) and education. <br><br>  In the spring of 2013, the NeuroGaming Conference &amp; Expo was held in San Francisco, during which 18 companies from all over the world demonstrated "neurological" achievements in the field of entertainment.  For example, composer Richard Warp (Richard Warp) introduced the NeuroDisco system, which, using a special headset, allowed the listener to mix music in response to changes in his emotional state. <br><br>  Similar conferences are held in the field of education.  For example, during the <a href="http://www.potomacinstitute.org/academic-centers/center-for-neurotechnology-studies/cns-events-and-publications/9-cns/cns-events-publications/4-neurotechnology-enhancing-the-human-brain-and-reshaping-society">seminar on</a> ‚ÄúNeurotechnology: Improving the Human Brain and Changing the Face of Society,‚Äù conducted by the PIPS Institute for Political Studies, scientists shared their thoughts about how new technologies will help improve human cognitive abilities through biological, chemical, and sensorimotor solutions. <br><br>  As for Russia, neuromedical equipment remains the most intensively developing area.  For example, the domestic company Neurobiotics has developed a brain-computer interface that allows paralyzed patients to control exoskeletons using electroencephalograms.  The achievement was tested as part of the Cybathlon competition for ‚Äúcyborg athletes‚Äù. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UxymIpN9X10" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Another company operating in this area is Motorika, which was <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/archive/archive2/news/4410/">founded by a</a> graduate of the Faculty of Precision Mechanics and Technology at ITMO University Ilya Chech.  The team is working to create <a href="http://www.forbes.ru/tekhnologii/mekhanizmy-i-gadzhety/265071-pechatnyi-organ-kak-3d-pechat-pomogla-sozdat-deshevyi-prote">affordable</a> dentures using 3D printing to help children with hand injuries. <br><br>  At the same time, "Motorika" is developing and <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/science/cyberphysics/news/5364">bionic prostheses</a> , which can control the signals of the nervous system, removed from the forearm.  The developers are planning to launch the first Russian bionic prosthesis of the whole arm, and to date, a prosthetic brush has been created, which has <a href="http://motorica.org/protezirovanie/stradivary">been</a> successfully tested. <br><br>  Another promising area of ‚Äã‚Äãneurotechnology development is the education sector.  According to <a href="http://rusneuro.net/chto-takoe-nejronet/segmenty-i-proyekty/neyro-obrazovaniye">forecasts of</a> experts of the Neuronet group engaged in the development of the Internet, e-learning will soon be used for neural computing interfaces.  Virtual reality helmets will begin to monitor the student's psycho-emotional state, preventing ‚Äúburnout‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe popularity of online learning is growing from year to year, but there are a number of problems: up to now, no more than 5% of students successfully complete online courses,‚Äù comments Lyubov Lisitsyna, head of the Department of Computer Educational Technologies at ITMO University.  ‚ÄúThe way to solve the problem of poor performance of online courses lies in the development of e-learning technologies, in the use of new models and methods for implementing neural interfaces in order to expand brain resources.‚Äù <br><br>  Therefore, the staff of the University ITMO are developing to create special software and hardware systems for the study of human behavior during training.  The company "Neuronet" declare that neurotechnologies are a promising and promising direction.  They also suggest that in 2035 the scope of neuro-formation in the world market will be estimated at 280 billion dollars. <br><br><h2>  Features of the training of specialists in neurotechnology </h2><br>  The international analytical agency Markets and markets conducted a study and <a href="http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/brain-computer-interface-market-64821525.html">found</a> that one of the main limiting factors in the growth of the neurotechnology market is the lack of qualified technical experts to develop and maintain complex neural interfaces.  At the same time, according to research firm Allied Market Research, by 2020, the development of neurotechnology will be one of the most high-tech processes. <br><br>  First of all, this is due to the fact that neurotechnologies <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-degree-should-I-get-for-neurotechnology">are located</a> at the intersection of computer science, biology, medicine, materials science and mechanical engineering.  To succeed in this area, it is not enough just to be able to program - you need to know the structure of the central nervous system, understand how the brain functions, and understand the features of the human body as a whole. <br><br>  It was decided to unite these areas of knowledge at ITMO University.  From 2017, a new undergraduate program ‚Äú <a href="https://abit.ifmo.ru/program/8062/">Neurotechnology and Programming</a> ‚Äù will appear at the Department of Computer Educational Technologies.  As Lyubov Lisitsyna notes, at present there is nothing of the kind in Russia, and the decision to open is a reaction to the demands of the labor market. <br><br><h2>  What will graduates be able to do? </h2><br>  The first block of the training program includes programming in several languages ‚Äã‚Äãusing specialized software packages and specifications.  At the heart of the second unit is an introduction to the results of scientific research at ITMO University related to neurotechnology. <br><br>  ‚ÄúDuring the course, the student will acquire the skills to create software systems using neural interfaces to solve various problems.  For example, for personal identification, for determining the emotional state of a person, for developing cognitive functions, ‚Äù <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/education/students/news/6526/">says</a> Lyubov Lisitsyna.  Thus, the graduate will not only be a good programmer, but will also receive knowledge of artificial intelligence, biometrics, and affective computing. <br><br>  <i>You can get more information about the content of the ‚ÄúNeurotechnology and Programming‚Äù program, as well as ask a question directly on <a href="http://dce.ifmo.ru/np/">the</a> department <a href="http://dce.ifmo.ru/np/">website</a> .</i> <br><br><hr><br>  PS What else do we write on Habr√©: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/spbifmo/blog/324484/">A programmer without a diploma: what can and what can not give "home schooling" in IT</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/spbifmo/blog/323780/">How programs are designed: from UML to automata</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/spbifmo/blog/323774/">Big interview: how to enter ITMO University</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/324780/">https://habr.com/ru/post/324780/</a></p>
