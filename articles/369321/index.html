Today we will look at one of those with which, perhaps, TeachBase is most often compared: the world-famous, but funny <a href="https://moodle.org/">Moodle</a> solution that sounds only in Russian. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c21/441/fd5/c21441fd541c40548107adfbaea9f8f4.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Kingdom for horse </h2><br>  For obvious reasons, expensive LMS platforms are often unavailable for our schools.  But, following the proverb, ‚Äúthe need for invention is cunning,‚Äù teachers learn to do much with their own hands.  That is why the free open source Moodle platform has gained such popularity.  However, its free determines and its main disadvantages: <br><br><ol><li>  Everything will have to collect yourself, starting with the server, which will go to the platform. </li><li>  You will not have technical support.  She simply does not. </li></ol><br>  The second point is quite easily removed by the efforts of the numerous community, which this system managed to acquire.  But, nevertheless, there is a difference with professional technical support.

    <h2>  What is Moodle </h2><br>  Moodle's capabilities are difficult to block even for very serious corporate solutions.  The platform is a course management system designed for cloud-based learning.  This virtual learning environment can be customized from scratch directly to customer requirements.  It has a wide toolset of plug-ins, which allows the user to customize their own e-learning space for the specifics of future <a href="">courses</a> . <br><br>  Despite the fact that the system has a 14-year history, it has not taken root in the corporate segment.  First of all, because corporate customers view free products as inappropriate, based primarily on the fact that even if you don‚Äôt have to pay for the system itself, you will have to either pay for it or spend time or install a system crooked and in the end do not get anything, losing time.  And time is money. <br><br>  Despite this, teachers around the world are interested in the system and support it.  However, it should be noted that in order to deploy and configure the system, you need a specialist or in-depth knowledge of web development.  In addition, its implementation and bringing to mind for your needs will take precious time. <br><br>  <b>Dignity moodle</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Free system </li><li>  Almost unlimited customization options </li><li>  Ability to install on any server </li><li>  The presence of a wide range of functionality to ensure the learning process (there is almost everything) </li></ul><br>  <b>Moodle Disadvantages</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Design solutions out of the box </li><li>  Lack of professional technical support </li><li>  The need to build a system from scratch </li><li>  System complexity </li><li>  Requires technical competence in web development from the teacher </li></ul><br>  <a href="https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php%3Fd%3D272400">You</a> can learn <a href="https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php%3Fd%3D272400">more about the pros and cons</a> on the official Moodle forum. <br><br>  In a word, it‚Äôs not for nothing that Moodle has so many loyal fans.  At the same time, the system is not fully suitable for teachers who do not have the skills of web development or do not want to spend their time installing and debugging the system.  In this case, the teacher is looking for a ready-made solution, where he can simply download the material, gather students online and conduct a lesson. <br><br><h2>  Alternative solutions </h2><br>  Teachers keep up with progress, even if they do not use Moodle.  Skype classes are becoming increasingly common, as well as courses from teachers on Youtube, which often gather a wide audience due to the dynamism and quality of presentation. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/wZJVkYhOB4Y%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiq2y5qe0BtthYOHtq5s_bsuQuZ6w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  We by no means want to compare Skype with a holistic LMS platform, but this trend suggests that teachers are ready and willing to go online.  And, perhaps, the lack of technical competencies is the only thing that holds them back from systematic, targeted actions. <br><br><h2>  All the same, but with mother of pearl buttons </h2><br>  And here comes Teachbase.  Immediately make a reservation that we will not compare ourselves with Moodle - this is not quite correct.  Moodle has more features and more flexible customization options - in case you are ready to spend time and budget on the web developer who will build the system specifically for you.  In turn, Teachbase is a light cloud commercial solution with a simple interface and one of the most affordable price tags. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c8/d3d/086/7c8d3d08611f4e6584c917c215a6a181.png"><br><br>  Teachbase allows you to organize online courses from and to.  All you need to start is to register in the system.  The functionality of the system makes it possible, firstly, to properly organize training and testing material, testing, and secondly, to organize the workplace of students with the ability to monitor the performance of each individual student and the group as a whole. <br><br>  The platform allows you to conduct live courses through webinars, add pre-prepared courses to them and, thus, combine synchronous and asynchronous training.  Everything is in an easy and convenient interface where everything is ready for the work of a teacher, which significantly reduces the implementation time - from the idea to the finished course. <br><br>  The simplicity of the courses was already appreciated by teachers from various schools and training centers, who, within the online conference of Intel and Educational Galaxy, created their first courses from scratch to ready state in just 10 days.  Many courses now live their lives and up to 200 students attend them. <br><br><h2>  With a simple movement we turn a loaf of bread into a trolley bus </h2><br><img src="http://habr.habrastorage.org/comment_images/a96/57a/a87/a9657aa87c564222155f9ab8a149fe6b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Take Excel as an example: an excellent program, but to fully master its capabilities, you need to take a special course.  As a result, most people simply use standard formulas and ready-made graphs.  In Excel, you can even write programs.  ‚ÄúBut why?‚Äù And no one does. <br><br>  Teachbase and Moodle have their own circle of possibilities and their user.  We work for those who need to quickly launch their course, combine students and build the learning process to a greater extent, rather than devoting their time to deepening in web technologies and how to use them. <br><br> <a href="http://teachbase.ru/landing/%3Futm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_content%3DNews_268292"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b54/c26/9b1/b54c269b17a34122ba31a7f80eadd238.PNG"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369321/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369321/</a></p>
