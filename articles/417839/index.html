Many gamers trade in ‚Äúgear‚Äù, characters, pump over other people's characters for money, sell and buy in-game currencies.  In general, the possibilities are really a lot.  Some of the ways to earn quite honest, others - on the verge of honesty, and others - far beyond. <br><br>  German network security company Kromtech Security has <a href="https://kromtech.com/blog/security-center/digital-laundry">found</a> evidence that carders use stolen credit cards to purchase in-game currencies and things in mobile games like Clash of Clans, Clan Royale, and Marvel Contest of Champions.  Then they resell all this already for real money with the help of various services. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúA group of intruders using complex automated systems to acquire in-game resources launders money from stolen credit cards,‚Äù the Kromtech report says.

      And this is hardly something that can be done, since trading in game currencies, things, and various kinds of services is a solid source of income for many companies and individuals.  For example, the company Electronic Arts has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/31/wall-street-is-giddy-over-eas-surging-microtransaction-profits.html">earned</a> about $ 787 million on Star Wars: Battlefront II - this is only in-game purchases, not the sale of the game itself. <br><br>  Network security experts have previously stated that in-game currencies and everything connected with them are a great way for intruders to launder ‚Äúdirty‚Äù money without much risk and danger to themselves.  All this has been called the "cybercriminal dream".  To track such transactions, and even more so to block them, is extremely difficult.  Moreover, in most cases, it is also not possible to identify the attacker. <br><br>  Interestingly, back in 2011, the FBI representatives conducted <a href="http://www.annarbor.com/news/crime/fbi-agents-search-university-towers-apartment-during-probe-involving-world-of-warcraft-gamers/">several raids</a> in student dormitories, suspecting them of being abused in World of Warcraft.  Then it ended in nothing, but the epic trade with all sorts of gaming things and currency continues.  The infrastructure of trading virtual goods and currencies is especially well developed in EVE Online where there is also an in-game currency and the ability to launder money. <br><br>  Fraud attackers company Kromtech discovered, one might say, by chance.  Employees of the company have identified the MongoDB database.  She was not protected at all, and the base was opened without any problems.  As it turned out, it contained more than 37 thousand records with credit card data.  This database was created by cybercriminals who created automatic tools for stealing credit card numbers and entering them into the database with further use of this data to purchase game currency and goods.  Further, all this was sold, as mentioned above.  And all this is automatic and semi-automatic, so the authors of this whole scam did not waste too much time. <br><br>  So far, the creators of games where money is laundered from stolen credit cards have not commented on what happened. <br><br>  And it would be worthwhile to comment, since the method described above is far from new.  Now the machinations of cybercriminals were discovered only by chance - after all, not every day hackers leave credit card data, which they obtain in various ways, completely unprotected. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/caa/0bc/da7/caa0bcda78bca1ec215e22e5871c9170.png"><br><br>  Work with game accounts is conducted from specially created Apple accounts.  Such records are generated in large numbers using jailbroken iPhones of various models. <br><br>  After the account is created, the validation of credit cards begins.  As soon as a ‚Äúgood‚Äù card is found, funds are withdrawn from it for the purchase of in-game currency and other resources.  Then everything purchased is offered on other resources - and such ads are also generated automatically.  The result is a real ‚Äúwashing machine‚Äù for money laundering. <br><br>  Resources come true on the ‚Äúgray‚Äù market g2g.com - a platform where resources of the most different games are sold and bought, from World of Warcraft to the same Clash of Clans.  The cost of resources in a single ad rarely exceeds $ 90.  But carders have many thousands of such accounts.  According to the information security specialists, out of 37 thousand credit cards they managed to use about 20 thousand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/519/443/6e7/5194436e7a08f98533a915704db41eb5.jpg"><br><br>  It is not entirely clear how much money the attackers got as a result of turning their scheme.  But I managed to find out that she worked for only about a month.  After identifying it, the experts submitted a report to the US Department of Justice, as well as to the developers of the games themselves. <br><br>  It is worth noting that cybercriminals also used Android, but the system used by Google made it difficult to automatically launder funds, so it was mainly used by the iPhone and iTunes.  If you introduce more stringent security measures, then attackers will complicate the implementation of the voiced scheme. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/417839/">https://habr.com/ru/post/417839/</a></p>
