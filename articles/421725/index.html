I began my story about the hackathon in Wrike because Hackathon is like a fairy tale: enthusiasts gather to give life to their ideas.  An idea is being released, like a fairy-tale arrow, and then it may fall on the boyar's courtyard, or perhaps disappear in the swamp of everyday life.  And, as in a fairy tale, it is always exciting.  It‚Äôs not just that in a very short time, to assemble a team, and to make a product from an idea, and even show it so that honest people surprise. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vt/tj/fs/vttjfsyaoy0creit9_isnjp5kry.jpeg" alt="Kirill"><br><br>  But seriously, I want to share the experience of participation in the hackathon, where we have developed our augmented reality (AR).  I'll tell you about how we tried to find a ready-made AR SDK for our task, but we could not.  In the end, they decided to write AR themselves and succeeded. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  A tip </h3><br>  I love hackathons very much: I took part in several, I had to do it myself, and if I could, I would take part.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ts/f3/xx/tsf3xx6iuuvraiacvqn9dctht98.jpeg" alt="In search of happiness"><br><br>  Hakatons are often conducted by specific organizations, and this works for the company's HR brand.  The goals may be different: a story about a company or a product, hiring different degrees of aggressiveness, organizing a thematic community, searching for fresh ideas ( <i>despite the armies of their own productologists, it may be useful to get a bunch of ideas from dreamers with a straightforward look at the subject area</i> ) and so on. d. <br><br>  For participants it is an opportunity to get acquainted with the company, because often a hackathon is its reflection, and it is possible to draw conclusions about the internal kitchen.  To understand the processes in a company, you can look at how it organizes the hackathon: what are the limitations for projects participating in the hackathon ( <i>scope of tasks, subject area, technology, tools, etc.</i> );  the level of the event;  criteria and transparency of the competitive part;  refereeing - composition and quality;  what are the rules and methods of forming teams.  In general, companies are divided into those who conduct hackathons ( <i>internal or public</i> ) and those who do not.  I prefer those who conduct, because  these are more open companies. <br><br>  I myself go to hackathons not for the sake of victory, but for the sake of participation.  I am interested in: <br><br><ul><li>  <b><i>Try new technologies.</i></b>  On one ‚Äúfood‚Äù hackathon we took <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DUQy6HrUfa6I">Flutter</a> , and wrote the application for ios and android.  Although none of us have tried Flutter before, the truth is that we were able to <a href="https://habr.com/company/wrike/blog/330832/">Dart</a> . </li><li>  <b><i>To</i></b> get to know <b><i>and work with new people</i></b> , so after one of the ‚Äúcity‚Äù hackathons, I called an accomplice of the hakaton project to work in my team for the main job, which I never regretted.  Hackathon is a great way to check out a comrade in action. </li><li>  <b><i>To do something that I really need myself.</i></b>  On the internal hackathon they wrote down the application, which was later used in the work. </li><li>  <b><i>Just get positive emotions from creation.</i></b>  I really like the hackathon atmosphere! </li></ul><br>  Therefore, I am happy to participate in the wrike hackathons ( <i>this year was the third internal hackathon</i> ), where we invent and make wrike even better: some of the previous hackathon projects already live in our product, and some are in team backlogs.  The scale also inspires, despite the fact that the hackathon is internal, there are about 30 teams recruited ( <i>more than 100 people</i> ) - all with fresh cool ideas. <br><br>  On the hackathon 2018, I decided to try working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality">AR</a> .  In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVP,</a> I wanted to display wrike tasks ( <i>name, status, performers, etc.</i> ) on the mobile phone screen when hovering over a graphic code with the task identifier encrypted in it, as well as adding the ability to change the status and assign / remove the task from itself.  There is an idea, there is a hackathon, the case didn‚Äôt follow the team either.  On the appointed day everything began to turn out. <br><br><h3>  I asked ash </h3><br>  I don‚Äôt particularly prepare for hackathons in terms of setting up the environment ( <i>searching for SDK and frameworks; installing software; configuring, etc.</i> ), writing code in advance, etc., but I‚Äôm only working on ideas, features, thinking about what to do. etc.  Therefore, we conferred with the team that we would write in Java ( <i>it‚Äôs written on Android natively on it</i> ), and it was hypothesized that it was probably full of ready-made AR libraries.  Our plan is to take a convenient SDK, attach the <a href="https://developers.wrike.com/">Wrike API</a> to it, and then focus on writing the logic of our application.  Thus, our first task was to find a convenient Java AR SDK, which allows you to: <br><br><ul><li>  Draw something on a given virtual surface. </li><li>  Integrate / already contains a scanner of dynamic graphic elements ( <i>barcode, QR, etc.</i> ). </li><li>  Work with a low entry threshold ( <i>we are on the hackathon, we need to quickly</i> ): there is a demo, there is documentation, there is a free / trial version. </li></ul><br>  Looks like a pretty simple task.  And we started sorting through options based on articles like " <i>Top Augmented Reality SDK in 2018</i> " <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kr/et/ic/kretic2lyujcjcmsohl4oqmildw.jpeg" alt="Sun, Moon, Wind"><br><br><h4>  Google's <a href="https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/">ARCore</a> </h4><br>  First, we turned our views on Google.  They opened the " <a href="https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/java/quickstart">Quick Start</a> ", did everything according to the instructions, launched and, oh, a miracle, everything works: I have Androids on my desk, who can also be moved.  The feeling that we have found the "foundation" for our application.  But further disappointment followed, <a href="https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/java/augmented-images/">image recognition</a> does not work as we need: there can be only one picture, it should be clearly visible, and it should be from the base of previously known pictures ( <i>and we should have our own unique marker for each task</i> ).  And the saddest thing is the inability to control the focus, which makes it difficult for the user to catch the image we need for recognition.  The truth is now with the <a href="https://github.com/google-ar/arcore-android-sdk/issues/200">problem solved</a> , but we had to continue the search.  In general, Google was good, but not for our task.  And because of the specifics of the work of OpenGL on OSX, we could not make the demo work in the emulator and did everything on a live phone. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.vuforia.com/">Vuforia</a> </h4><br>  Read the documentation, watched the <a href="https://youtu.be/jAmU0L_wfV0">videos</a> , it looks impressive.  Many features, for example, <a href="https://library.vuforia.com/content/vuforia-library/en/articles/Training/Image-Target-Guide.html">Image Targets</a> .  We decided to try: registered, downloaded, collected, launched.  Demo application started, but neither on the emulator, nor on live android-e did not work.  Attempting to verify any function caused the entire application to crash.  It was decided not to waste time searching for a problem and fixing it, and moving on to the next SDK. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.wikitude.com/products/wikitude-sdk/">Wikitude</a> </h4><br>  We downloaded the SDK, went to the <a href="http://www.wikitude.com/external/doc/documentation/latest/androidnative/gettingstartedandroidnative.html">tutorial</a> , launched the demo.  There are a lot of opportunities here, the demo is immediately impressive, a lot of mini examples, we have played enough ( <i>for example, there is <a href="https://www.wikitude.com/external/doc/documentation/latest/androidnative/pluginsapi.html">face recognition</a></i> ), and, oh, a miracle, the demo already has QR recognition.  But the problem is that we get what is encrypted in the code, but do not know where it is located.  Began to understand how the QR scanner is arranged.  It turned out that it was made as a superstructure over <a href="http://zbar.sourceforge.net/">ZBar</a> in the form of a plus plug-in to the SDK.  First, a crazy thought came to uncover the gcc and finish the plug-in, so that it also gave the coordinates, but we stopped in time. <br><br><h3>  And they fought 3 days and 3 nights </h3><br>  Realizing that a good quarter of the time of the allotted days is behind, and we are still looking for our SDK (there <i>were tests and other solutions, not only described above, but also there was a fiasco</i> ), we decided not to look for a ‚Äúsilver bullet‚Äù anymore, but to take everything your hands  A new plan has matured: as a task marker, we take a QR code, as simple and common;  To recognize them, we take <a href="https://github.com/zxing/zxing/wiki/Getting-Started-Developing">ZXing</a> , which can recognize several codes at the same time and in addition to the value, the library also gives the coordinates of 3 ‚Äúsearch‚Äù points of the QR code.  And then on top of the code reader we will implement our AR.  We rolled up our sleeves and forward, we have 3 points, which means that with the help of affine transformations we can get everything we need. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jt/gi/gn/jtgigntu6lhizw2t9ndnp26ngas.jpeg" alt="Princess Frog"><br><br>  We did not begin to search for a library for mathematics, since the task is not difficult.  First of all, we made our class for the necessary recalculation of coordinates.  The final algorithm for working with QR code turned out to be rather primitive: <br><br><ul><li>  The image from the camera is transferred to ZXing, we get an array with the coordinates of the points and the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the QR code. </li><li>  From the 3 coordinates, we calculate the 4th angle of the square, increase the square one and a half times to cover the initial QR code, and get the basis for the card. </li><li>  Make a request to the Wrike API to retrieve data about the task. </li><li>  We draw a card, thanks to affine transformations, we save all distortions ( <i>viewing angle, rotation, scale</i> ). </li></ul><br>  We added an algorithm, it works, we test, we struggle with memory leaks, we add visual effects, we get pleasure from the hackathon. <br><br><h3>  And I was there, honey-beer drank </h3><br>  In hackathons, besides your product itself, it‚Äôs very important how you present it.  Everyone understands that you have a very short time and a technically beautiful solution is not expected of you, so you need to show the beauty of your idea.  I always like the story-telling approach, where it is clear to the audience, for whom the product is made, under what conditions it is used and what task it solves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t8/41/zw/t841zwppg11j60wwou4yqsa7ljs.jpeg" alt="Wrike hackathon"><br><br>  Therefore, in our presentation, in addition to demonstrating the obtained functionality, we called upon the power of imagination and described situations in which such augmented reality ( <i>AR glasses will soon become commonplace</i> ) can improve the lives of those who work not with a computer, but whose work is related to wrike.  For example, for the interaction between the designer-architect engaged in repairing the house, and the team that directly implements the project in the house itself. <br><br>  I think we honorably demonstrated our MVP, and caught our rays of love.  Summer is over and picnics and holidays are coming to an end, and we are thinking of devoting autumn evenings to the development of our Wrike AR. <br><br>  Thanks for the illustrations <a href="https://vk.com/sai_kinpub">Sai Kin</a> ! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/421725/">https://habr.com/ru/post/421725/</a></p>
