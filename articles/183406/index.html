  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to promote events in social networks? The story of one mass holiday</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We know that <b>the PR support of</b> one mass city holiday, attendance from 2,000 to 12,000 people, goes to a budget <b>of 600,000 to 2,000,000 rubles</b> .  Such a budget is spent mainly on radio advertising.  There may still be some advertising on TV and in print media, less often contextual (Yandex Direct) and media (banners).  Working with the site and in social networks is more difficult to outsource, so there is usually a brief announcement of the event and photos from previous holidays (if any), plus info logos partners.  Is it possible to gather a serious target audience through social networks?  We have proven that it is possible. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  ‚ÄúInternet experts have broken into two irreconcilable camps: some consider that social networks are excellent for commercial activities, others insist that this is a territory of consumers and here it is necessary to communicate, not sell.  Drovishk in the fire recently threw Coca-Cola.  Representatives of the company, which has 61 million friends on Facebook, shocked the market by claiming that communication in social networks "does not bring any tangible sales growth to it," and print advertising remains the most effective way to promote a brand, ‚Äù <a href="http://slon.ru/business/prodazhnye_druzya_zachem_nuzhna_reklama_v_sotsialnykh_setyakh-929460.xhtml">writes Slon</a> . <br><br>  The same article provides an example of Ben &amp; Jerry's American ice cream brand, which is able to achieve ‚Äú <b>noticeable sales growth</b> ‚Äù through games with the user on the territory of social networks.  ‚ÄúResearchers say that to buy on social networks it‚Äôs not enough to show people a paid ad - we need to get involved in a game, a competition, or any other interesting action.  The product itself is best offered for free or at a big discount.  In addition, it is important to link online and offline activity together, ‚Äù <a href="http://slon.ru/business/prodazhnye_druzya_zachem_nuzhna_reklama_v_sotsialnykh_setyakh-929460.xhtml">advises the same Slon</a> .

      <a href="http://www.kidsreview.ru/actions/kids-friendly-quest">‚ÄúKids-friendly Petersburg‚Äù</a> is such a new format of the industrial exhibition, where instead of boring stands and bored visitors, there is a common game scenario in which all participants are equally involved (children, parents, representatives of companies).  The exhibition-quest has already been held in St. Petersburg three times, gathering <b>from 3,000 to 8,000 visitors in 7 hours of</b> work ‚Äî a phenomenal, in fact, result.  With such indicators of attendance, the Quest ‚ÄúKids-friendly Petersburg‚Äù can consider itself the most visited exhibition project of children's and family subjects in the North-West. <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúWhere do all these people come from?‚Äù</b> - companies that consider participation in the exhibition ask us, ‚ÄúWill you advertise on the radio?‚Äù Well, we tried it once, advertising on the radio, and with a meager budget of 50,000 rubles, on Quest 3 people came from it.  More we did not go this way. <br><br>  Experience has shown that in St. Petersburg ‚Äúmeetings‚Äù on Facebook are not popular, in St. Petersburg ‚Äúlove‚Äù VKontakte.  We created a <a href="http://vk.com/kidsfriendly_spb">VKontakte event</a> and started announcing in it what awaits visitors to the exhibition: each of the 20-30 gaming stations (exhibition stands).  Firstly, participation in the event is free for visitors, and secondly, we know our target audience well for the <a href="http://www.kidsreview.ru/afisha/events">Children's Playbill of St. Petersburg</a> .  We worked long and hard with each of the companies, inventing with them a quest game for the Quest, which will attract both children and parents, and allow everyone to remember which company exactly organized this game and what can be bought from it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/945/d10/c01/945d10c01b24b7872781a197ada0a02f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Then we announced each gaming station briefly, <b>without the ‚Äúbest‚Äù, ‚Äúbest‚Äù</b> , ‚Äúbroadest‚Äù and ‚Äúevery mother knows‚Äù, and ‚Äúevery child loves‚Äù and so that it is immediately clear what will happen and for whom and why it is worth do not miss the event. <br><br>  We can summarize our actions as follows: we wrote for the target audience (families with children) that they can attend events that are interesting to them for free.  Of course, the campaign began through reposts in our main VKontakte group ‚Äú <a href="http://vk.com/kidsreview_spb">Where to go with the child in St. Petersburg</a> ‚Äù, as well as in the groups of companies participating in the exhibition, everyone was happy to talk about their participation in the fun project. <br><br>  Then we began to involve people in the game through multiple <a href="http://vk.com/kidsfriendly_spb%3Fw%3Dwall-38391494_861"><b>raffles of</b> small prizes</a> and even simply discounts on the services of participating companies.  In most cases, users had to correctly <b>answer a funny question</b> (necessarily illustrated with a vivid picture) and share the recording with friends.  Of course, it was already possible to pick up a won prize or a discount certificate at the event itself.  The more interesting the question, the mile the picture and the more prizes for the participants - the more reposts the announcement of the Quest.  When conducting draws on social networks, the process of selecting the winners should be very transparent, and the question should be ‚Äúcool‚Äù and intriguing, such as it is not ashamed to place on your wall. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7d4/898/359/7d48983596f43ab4290ab8b04bcaa2fe.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Two weeks before the date of the Quest, we began to place (300-5000 rubles for the post or by barter) announcements of the whole event, as well as individual stations, most attractive according to the description, in third-party groups of the kind <a href="http://vk.com/kudagospb">‚ÄúKudago‚Äù in St. Petersburg</a> . <br><br>  The result: about 1000 participants of the meeting and a little more than 1200 possible participants.  Statistics Quest visitors is as follows - <b>3360 people</b> , of which: <br><br>  <b>- 43.1%</b> followed the Quest announcements via VKontakte <br>  - 27.7% - through the site KidsReview.ru <br>  - 16% learned about the Quest from friends (also through social networks?) <br>  - 5.9% - from Yandex Poster for Children <br>  - 2.9% - randomly through search engines <br>  - 4.2% - from other sources (for work, through announcements in print and electronic media - we still sent a press release to our press base) <br>  - 0.2% - through Facebook <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/fJZUz9Q5oLc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgQ94Qzaf0aN8aaky3zTb0wEOGhnw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  After the event itself, we continued to work in social networks by actively responding to feedback and questions from participants, as well as posting numerous photo reports from the event.
