Rather, it still happens, even with the result, everything is already, in my opinion, crystal clear.  To be honest, she had already gotten me, and so I decided to take a break and write a useful topic on Habr.  Useful - because, perhaps, will serve as a warning to novice designers / layout designers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, some time ago I had free time - a lull in the main business.  I decided to spend this time with benefits, since the money is never superfluous, and I began to look for orders for any of my specializations.  And, characteristically, I found it almost immediately - a friend of my friend advised a certain comrade who needed to make a paper magazine design. <br><br>  I phoned with a friend, and then drove up to him personally.  Civil office, is engaged - it is really alerted - cleaning, legal services and something else there.  The owner wants a personal advertising and entertainment magazine, moreover, they have already released two issues that were not very successful, and desperately want a third, finally successful one. <br>  No question, chief, everything will be!  In addition, the prospects were most optimistic: there is an advertising manager and editor, and all the advertising modules and texts are available.  Lay out - and you're done.  Fortunately, until mid-December, when he was supposed to go to press, a lot of time remained. <br>  Agreed on everything, signed a contract, after which I stood in anticipation of materials. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The first call was that the materials did not appear immediately.  Moreover, something was simply missing, and advertising modules were not coordinated.  But we also have a manager and editor! <br>  After several calls and somewhere after the week, both of these figures finally drew on our doorstep.  It turned out the following: half of the advertisements need to be drawn from scratch, texts and pictures are not selected, a magazine grid and a list of headings are not available. And the materials from the previous numbers are scattered on the desktop computer and are chaotic to the limit.  Hello, sailed. <br><br>  It was not possible to explain to the employer that the selection of pictures and texts is a separate fee.  Outrage over digging in the garbage also went into the void.  Eh, quit everything then and do other projects ... But no, the prospect of my name appearing in a paper magazine (which is a good recommendation) overpowered all the possible points against.  We work on. <br><br>  Next - leapfrog with approvals and placement of the material.  Something had to be added practically before sending it to the press, because before that nobody had been able to come up with this ‚Äúsomething‚Äù.  Agreements with advertisers were about the same: at the last moment, the manager on nerves resorts and shouts that she is gone, someone does not accept the module due to the fact that the angle of disclosure of the triangle on the logo is 5 degrees more than what is needed 0.0 measured? .. <br>  Finally, it would seem, everything is ready.  We fill in on the USB stick and we send with the manager to printing house.  We are waiting for legal wages. <br><br>  Horseradish with two!  The next day it turns out that there will be no printing house, because the owner of the magazine for the first time in a month (!) Found time (!!) to look at his own future magazine (!!!) and found there twenty-three errors (!!!!).  I note that he had been asked to look at the materials several times before, but he replied that the editor was engaged in this. <br>  In convulsions we rule everything for two days.  Prepare for printing again ... <br>  Horseradish with two!  Again, something is wrong, and besides, as suddenly (!) It turned out, the printing house does not accept TIFF, only Corel or InDesign.  Okay, figs with you, pour in Korela.  And silence again. <br><br>  In general, I will not retell all the details of the last stage.  A lot of calls and mutual discontent.  "Brakes" from the management.  More brakes.  And further.  The result is that the employer has not been in touch for a week, simply dropping the call and not answering the SMS.  He did not receive his journal ‚Äî it is in my last edition, with the next series of corrections.  The previous versions that I gave are irrelevant for a number of reasons, therefore, it isn‚Äôt like to call it a ‚Äúkid‚Äù. <br>  In addition, the editor found out that not a single printing house will now accept a print magazine - the new year, s.  The signed agreement is, but the sense with it, apparently, is not enough.  Threatened with court - already threatened, no reaction followed. <br><br>  To be honest, looking at the four-flash flash drive, which this hero also left with me, I want to change the well-known phrase: I made the most stupid magazine in the world, and all I received was this stupid flash drive. <br><br>  Morality?  Do not work without prepayment.  Make a normal work plan.  Discuss all terms and conditions.  And duties.  Otherwise, you will run into such a ... dwarf.  A month of hard work is wasted and this damn flash drive will be a good reminder.  At least for me. <br><br>  Happiness to you, habrazhiteli, and happy New Year!  ) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79675/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79675/</a></p>
