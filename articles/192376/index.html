  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Post about Habr√© and good</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Here, on Habr√©, there is a very interesting indicator called Karma.  It is formed by the users themselves, allowing them to express a certain attitude towards others.  That is why, as a statistic, karma is a very interesting indicator.  By analyzing such statistics, you can see the "mood" of the community.  In the article I will try to slightly reveal the nature of the habosoobschestva.  Want to get to know him better? <a name="habracut"></a><habracut><br><br>  As statistical data, I took the history of the change in the karma of users from the service <a href="http://habrometr.ru/">habrometr.ru</a> .  Thanks to user <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/feedbee/" class="user_link">feedbee</a> , for the excellent service and data provided. <br><br>  I understand that not all users are registered there and everything that will be said below, perceive with some degree of inaccuracy.  But don't be disappointed, interested reader, there are quite a lot of users and a rather ‚Äúhigh-quality‚Äù sample.

    <h4>  Portrait sampling </h4><br>  Total Service Users: <b>18,539</b> <br>  Total logs that were recorded since the launch of the service: <b>17 976 030</b> <br><br><h5>  Sampling activity: </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/3ff/593/e23/3ff593e2383864538a8d77926e1e1d80.png"><br>  Inactive are those who have not indicated in the profile the date of the last stay in the habr. <br>  <b>To confirm the quality of the sample, let's compare the demographic statistics:</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/4a9/373/0cf/4a93730cfa58be2e3c1ca7e81fcca3fd.png"><br>  I did not find a way to determine the "middle" sex by user profile, so I included them all in the male half.  Given this, the percentages are identical. <br>  So, with the portrait sampled.  Now let's look at some statistics on users. <br><br><h5>  Visiting activity </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/58d/5ed/689/58d5ed6893430197ab4b90044b4c6e57.png"><br>  It can be noted that more than 6,000 users ( <b>36%</b> of active users) visited the site at least six months ago.  This indicates the variability of habrochanin‚Äôs character or the fact that he reads articles without authorization, perhaps with the help of RSS readers. <br><br><h4>  Karma </h4><br>  So, we have reached karma.  And the most intriguing question here is its merging and promotion.  As well as the reasons why this was done.  To begin with, a graph showing the volumes of merging and increasing.  For convenience, the indicators of karma were taken with a difference of at least 10 units in a period of a maximum of 10 days, since  there were days and even months when the habrometer lay peacefully. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/114/c5c/2f9/114c5c2f995209f25fb1cfcb553d55ec.png"><br>  It is clearly seen that for most users, karma grows rather than falls.  And it also shows that they furiously plus and merge with the same frenzy. <br>  But there is one <b>BUT</b> ... these are the reasons for the change in karma. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/a2b/f4e/1e3/a2bf4e1e3ceba3b372278da9f35ae48c.png"><br>  Only cases were analyzed when the karma was changed by at least 15 units, but this does not change the picture as a whole, since  and in this case, the ratio of 30% to 70%.  As you can see, the karma is poured mostly for comments, and lift for written articles. <br>  In analyzing the reasons for the discharge of karma, I decided to highlight the ways in which this can be achieved. <br><br><h4>  TOP 7 ways to be merged </h4><br><ol><li>  To justify an act, which is obviously bad, with bright colors (exactly the opposite).  And if you are somehow connected with the commission of this act, it is a little harder to make excuses. </li><li>  Insult someone else's faith, nation, love for Android.  As a rule, this is followed by holivars and eerie length of the thread in the comments, which are of absolutely no value in the context of the topic. </li><li>  To be not objective in a dispute, to emotionally prove one's point of view, without giving facts.  So you can show your not competence in the matter under discussion and attract the attention of others. </li><li>  Be a rogue. </li><li>  Foul language </li><li>  Before you join or start a discussion, do not get acquainted with the subject of conversation. </li><li>  Write an article violating the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/info/help/rules/">rules of Habr</a> . </li></ol><br>  That is the nature of the habrosoobschestva.  Constructive conversations are most valued here and do not tolerate ignorant behavior. <br><br><h4>  please </h4><br>  It all started with a desire to write about the growing level of negativity, depression, discontent with ourselves and in the society around us.  Together with knowledge and education, a lot of gray is being absorbed by us through the global network at an incredible speed.  Social networks, all kinds of portals, groups, newsletters ... all this connects one person with a whole crowd of other people who have their own world view and their own truth, which they often don‚Äôt mind sharing and, in some cases, impose.  I wanted to write that all information becomes more concentrated, accumulating in different forms and quantities everywhere around, not only in the virtual space.  We need to be able to filter everything and choose.  The main thing to understand is that the thought / action left / committed by you in any form can reach tens / thousands / millions of people, which should imply a corresponding responsibility. <br><br>  Be kinder friends (more tolerant, more humane, more positive).  Make love, not war. <br><br>  I wanted to write about it, but then I remembered that Habr is not my personal blog and did not highlight this idea in a separate article, but diluted it with statistics and a little analysis. </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/192376/">https://habr.com/ru/post/192376/</a></p>
