  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Geoportal "Voice of the People"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Description of the problem </h4><br>  Recently, there have been many interesting online services on <s>bending the</s> interaction of citizens and state / municipal authorities: RosYam, RosZhKH, DomDvorDorogi, etc.  But such services are designed only for one interacting side, only for citizens, and in no way (or almost at all) do not contribute to improving the efficiency of work in the authorities themselves.  In which, from an increase in the flow of circulation of citizens in the "classical" way, only the head begins to hurt more. <br>  How to make the municipal and regional authorities guaranteed to respond to the appeals of citizens in electronic form? <br>  And how can one offer citizens a normal mechanism for participating in the life of the district / municipality? <br>  We, in TsKU-1, proposed a solution for "crossing a hedgehog with a snake." <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Frontend </h4><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe system is to enable citizens to report problems in the housing and utilities sector, transportation, law and order, etc., with reference to the problem site, while not forcing them to fill tons of papers and look for addresses and phone numbers of controlling organizations. <br>  We saw the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa frontend for citizens in Tatarstan under the <a href="https://uslugi.tatar.ru/open-gov">‚ÄúPeople's Control‚Äù system</a> .  And they made their own <a href="http://odinarod.ru/o4">"Voice of the People"</a> . <br>  (We are afraid to lay out a direct link on Habr, so the domain is wrapped via CDN CloudFlare, but if <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/125823/">CloudFlare is ‚Äútupit‚Äù</a> , then the direct link is odinnarod.ru). <br>  For our region, in contrast to the Kazan project, OpenStreetMap maps turned out to be more successful than Yandex or Google.  But if the project started now, then we would think about using 2GIS. <br><br><h4>  Backend </h4><br>  And what to do with the backend?  After studying the principles of work in the district administration, it became clear that without a really working electronic document management system (EDMS) in the administration itself, the introduction of any electronic means of interaction between citizens and officials is simply impossible.  It will not work.  Accordingly, the project immediately reached a new level. <br>  We decided to make a frontend for citizens and implement the SED in the administration at the same time.  For reasons beyond our control, the duration of the active phase of the entire project was limited to 6 months. <br>  How in 6 months to introduce the SED in the administration of the entire area (250+ jobs)?  Actually, this is a separate topic, a large article.  After a brief search on the SED market, we chose the <a href="http://www.motiw.ru/">Motive</a> system, which has the key properties for our case: <br><ul><li>  The SED has grown from a system for monitoring the execution of orders, and very successfully "falls" on the structure of the administration. </li><li>  Web interface, no need to configure / support end jobs </li><li>  Simple and clear architecture LAMP with all the ensuing optimization / security / expansion features </li></ul>

    <h4>  Scheme of work </h4><br>  The scheme of the system is quite simple: <br><ul><li>  User registers and creates an appeal on the ‚ÄúVoice of the People‚Äù </li><li>  The appeal is moderated by us.  All appeals containing explicit spam / taboo vocabulary, etc., are rejected. </li><li>  According to the schedule, once every 10 minutes, data is synchronized between the servers of the Voice of the People and the SED.  This is done intentionally so that, in case of any problems on the front end, do not put the SED </li><li>  The appeal from the ‚ÄúVoice of the People‚Äù automatically generates the workflow within the SED with the assignment of tasks, deadlines, responsible </li><li>  The status of the passage of the document in the EDS are displayed in the "Voice of the People" </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Result </h4><br>  It is still difficult to assess the result of this project, because  we are just releasing the project in open navigation.  But now it is clear that we: <br><ul><li>  Set a precedent at district / municipality level </li><li>  Were able to overcome the inertia of thinking officials </li><li>  Dali tool in the hands of citizens and the authorities </li></ul><br><br>  I'd like to hope that Habraeffect will stimulate citizens and officials to constructive interaction. <br><br><h6>  About Us </h6><br>  <a href="http://ssc-1.ru/">TsKU-1</a> - First Municipal Center for Space Services, with such a big name, in 2010, a division was created at the <a href="http://odinuni.ru/">Odintsovo Humanitarian Institute</a> with the support of Roscosmos to introduce various GLONASS-based systems into real life.  A lot has changed in 2 years, but not the name, although we are still working with GLONASS.  Now we are actually acting as an IT consultant / outsourcer / integrator at the municipality / district level. <br><br><h6>  Special thanks </h6><br>  Special thanks to the <a href="http://www.teamlab.com/">TeamLab</a> cloud service for the donated platform for group work and project management, without which we would hardly have succeeded in ‚Äúcrossing the hedgehog‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/173009/">https://habr.com/ru/post/173009/</a></p>
