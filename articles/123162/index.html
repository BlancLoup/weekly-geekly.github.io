We need to approach the task from the systemic, informational side, in order to then distribute the obtained solutions (subtasks) to various industries. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Tangle of tasks - indeed, rather big and comprehensive.  That is why we are starting to discuss related issues not somewhere at the state level (the task is far from setting subtasks and solutions), not on a science fiction forum (all technologies for subtasks are now), not among idlers (the goal is not a conversation, but a solution ), and here, in the environment of information technology.  Moreover, half of the tasks will be related to the processing of information processes and will not leave the framework of the information industry. <br><br><h4>  The general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsolving the problem </h4><br>  We have a lot of ways to transport people, objects and goods. <br>  Starting from the pockets of jackets and jackets, ending with cruise liners.  This refers to the entire transport, from mail and couriers to passenger.  The problem is that the tangle of solutions to these issues now takes a lot of time and money from society, each of us, instead of solving the problem in a comprehensive manner, to unify the processes of production and maintenance of each element of the process.

      Follow from the decision, I will notice at once, interesting results.  For starters, list them. <br><br>  <b>Keywords</b> : module, salon, car. <br><br>  * Cars will be collapsible, modular.  Each module provides its own function - wheel, wall, body (interior), engine. <br><br>  * Salons are assembled into modules for transporting goods or people in their insides - the mode of container transportation or ‚Äúcompartment car‚Äù is executed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/744/97a/2e1/74497a2e1df0bf6d6da9386229b11f9c.jpg"><br>  * Unused during group transport, the modules are disconnected and used on site for their intended purpose in other transport. <br><br>  * As a result, there is no need for individual modules belonging to a person or a family.  All modules are available for general use.  What does not exclude the opposite - personal salons, wheels, walls of cars.  It does not exclude the machine being inseparable, but all this increases the cost of operation and the ability to use the future infrastructure or its specific parts. <br><br>  * car interior as a temporary home of varying degrees of comfort.  Hotels and cars from temporary assembly salons. <br><br>  * Saloon standard - standard shipping container. <br><br>  * (Video surveillance solves the problems of hacking, thefts while reducing the weight of the walls - the question is not surprising, but so that the concept of the solution is clear - it is solved in close connection with IT.) <br><br>  * There is no need for parking if there are no cars.  The cabin modules bring people and goods to the ports of the premises (parking lots), where they simply move people and goods to their homes.  Then the door closes and there is no car until the next need for it. <br><br>  * Parking is a door in a dwelling the size of a car‚Äôs cabin wall (about half the height of a dwelling).  In high-rise buildings, this is obviously an elevator door.  For large loads, it is also obvious that a door of full (double) height is provided. <br><br>  * Transportation of furniture and goods from the home is no less simple, just like people ‚Äî through the door of the parking lot. <br><br>  * The walls of the machine are heat and sound insulation and design solution.  They can complement and expand the interior, design a multi-seat interior of the modules. <br><br>  * The most interesting.  Joining salons to a public carriage is performed while the car is in motion.  The car can be either a simple assembly of modules with a minimal overall frame, an analogue of cars for transporting cars, but a more compact layout, or an analogue of a bus (part of the wheels of cars is used for movement), and a separate room on its wheels (analogue of a train).  In this case, the lounges are disconnected after the transfer of passengers or movement of goods, and the gateways are ready for the next connection of modules.  Thus, the fast-moving car does not need to stop to take passengers or cargo, and they need to use their car for the whole trip.  Docking of cabin-modules to gateways is possible at any time on the way. <br><br>  * Build salons in the "bus" is needed to save energy to move (less air resistance), remove from the composition of optional modules (walls, wheels), compactness of movement, movement of passengers or cargo between modules (sorting, logistics on the go), use of large transport tunnel section of 4 or 8 salons. <br> <a href="http://www.autocarsblog.net/modular-solar-car-concept-futuristic-2030-219.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/18b/4a7/b05/18b4a7b059400b18502ca2a5448d01bf.jpg"></a> <br>  * Road - an optional place to move a single saloon.  The most convenient is a narrow tunnel (or highway) for movements over short distances, from 200 m to 2-5 km along a closed rail track.  Pros - cleanliness, environmental friendliness, high speed and capacity with no movement in places of residence.  The small size of the tunnel in width and height (2 seats in width).  The release of the road through the gateway does not interfere with the movement of the next transport in the tunnel.  In sparsely populated areas there is no need for a tunnel. <br><br><h4>  Implementation sizes </h4><br>  In general, the general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãimplementation is already half understood from theses.  We have a standard size "bus", which fits in a width of 5 people.  So, taking into account the walls, we have the width of the passenger compartment - half of the modern bus.  The height is also half the height of the bus, so the cabin modules are placed in it in 2 floors. <br><br>  How modules on 2 floors will dock together is already a subtask.  Solving it will give the described interesting logistics opportunities.  how walls and wheels are detached is also a subtask, but for starters you can leave the wheels in their places.  The engine is also considered small, electrically or benzine, but modularity is important in order to save the total use and simple modules of different functions. <br><br><h4>  Using </h4><br>  Total, the movement of a passenger or cargo in the size and weight of 1-5 passengers seems so.  Upon request, the nearest salon of the required quality is moved to the door (or it is scheduled for a specified time; there is no problem to buy an individual salon and not leave it for the whole trip, use it always, pay for property or place it in your apartment (2 by 4 meters - not so a lot), driving it empty between its friends with co-users is the whole question of the amount of costs).  He waits, as needed, the customer, there are optimal times of docking with trains, if the trips are long and leaving the cabin, but otherwise there is no tension in use.  The customer pays the expenses on the fact of use with all the resulting micropayments. <br><br>  Micropayments are calculated honestly, otherwise there will be no such progress - transport for all, and everyone will not pay a triple and higher price compared to the alternative.  Therefore, costs should be minimal and effective.  This is another subtask - to provide honest micropayments.  So far, you can practice on the system with cellular operators (the topic of a large separate article), then move on to transport. <br> <a href="http://sharkride.com/blog/2007/06/05/cool-concept-cars/"><img src="http://s43.radikal.ru/i100/1107/d0/4043c5a16100.jpg"></a> <br>  Further - for the customer of the trip (passenger) everything is very simple.  He knows how he will drive and what he will be asked to do on the road if he has to go from salon to salon (recall that, for simplicity, he can book a trip in the cabin continuously, door to door and sleep on the road, wake up in nature, back in the evening difference in the account).  He can follow the movement, communicate with others by phone, change plans, choose a different route - there will not be a catastrophic increase in expenses, because there are no real expenses.  I didn‚Äôt go further - transporting is easier, costs less, cost is also less.  Ticket booking is forgotten as a relic of the past.  The system works on a person, and not vice versa.  If you first work on the competent design of the system ... Without the potential of fraud and legal incidents.  In general, this is also a subtask for economists. <br><br>  Thus, not contradicting the laws of nature, a person or his goods can smoothly flow from one place to another, in proportion to the distance covered and traffic difficulties.  At the same time, a person does not deal with the road - he is fully engaged in his own affairs, occasionally being distracted by geography in the event of a change in plans. <br><br>  With smaller loads it is easier - they do not need large elevators and large tunnels.  But once they are there, small loads can be thrown into the general flow of the tunnel, joining with the standard salons of "cars".  Those.  the task of transporting small cargoes will be solved auxiliary and have less energy consumption.  In particular, it will be much more convenient to move the goods for viewing from the store than the buyer to the goods.  And the store is the sum of containers with goods scattered around the world at every moment. <br><br><h4>  Infrastructure </h4><br>  How to build a safe freight elevator with a passenger compartment is a task, in general, solved.  Only, given the mass character, security should be higher. <br><br>  Observation and payments.  The system involves the unwinding of any crimes and a fair calculation, otherwise it simply will not exist.  Rather, it will, but overhead with security and thick containers for cargo will hit the pocket so that it is better to arrange observation and analysis of the actions of individuals on the freeways than to pay for steel walls and the damage caused.  Well, let it not soon, but you need to know the path before you go on it? <br><img src="http://i062.radikal.ru/1107/f7/d452de676ea4.jpg"><br>  Ecology and comfort.  It is done for the sake of ecology and comfort.  In order not to increase the volume of parking and roads, the time of queues, the path to transport and the mass of unnecessary non-system costs - escalators, services, workers, a number of models of inconsistent non-modular machines.  With a cheaper and faster system, they themselves will become unprofitable. <br><br><h4>  Where to begin? </h4><br>  I think we should start with micropayments without predatory commissions in simple trading calculations, with a communication and video system (to ensure observation of the goods being delivered), with the design of a modular vehicle assembled on the go as part of a bus.  The latter is key, but success in the world is very small.  Just look at what they write on the topic of ‚Äúmodular transportation‚Äù.  However, what can be thought up more logical and obvious than such a transport system, and not more and more powerful parking lots and the flow of individual cars? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/123162/">https://habr.com/ru/post/123162/</a></p>
