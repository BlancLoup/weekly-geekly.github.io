  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Investor tips</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <em>‚Äú80% of applications received today in inVenture are variations on social services topics.</em>  <em>80% of them do not even reach consideration at the investment council</em> . <em>‚Äù</em>  ( <a href="http://inventure.ru/blog/2008/05/22/bum-socialnyx-servisov-poziciya-investora/">InVenture blog</a> ) <br><br>  Although the figures are not all so specific, but most investors say that most applications are rejected.  The obvious conclusion is that the problem is not only in the weakness of applications, but also in the lack of awareness of the applicants about what exactly the investors want from them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Attempts by investors to clarify their requests on their website are present to some extent, which is an example of the continuation of the quotation above: <em>we estimate them, which methods of their design, development and promotion we consider effective. ‚Äù</em>  However, the problem lies in the fact that this topic is too extensive to start from a distance on a separate site of a specific investor (organization) and introduce people into common problems.  Hence the conclusion - there is an unfulfilled need for a certain specialized information resource for startups.  I mentioned this earlier: <a href="http://vrus.habrahabr.ru/blog/46087.html">Beginning Reflections</a> , <a href="http://vrus.habrahabr.ru/blog/46099.html">On the Representation of Ideas</a> .  It seems to me that it would make sense for investors (or someone) to make such a common project.  And on their sites to describe only their own specifics, some clarifying requests.  The expected result of this approach is to reduce the flow of inappropriate applications and reduce the burden on their study, which will make it possible to pay more attention to applications that are more or less suitable.  The latter is particularly relevant in connection with the following consideration, which I analyzed in some detail in the text <a href="http://vrus.habrahabr.ru/blog/46099.html">About the presentation of ideas</a> , and now I will only briefly repeat it. <br><br>  This concerns the idea, i.e.  very primary stage of the project.  Although the ideas of most projects can be formulated quite concisely, clearly and clearly, the most interesting in the conceptual sense is contained in the remaining minority and requires increased attention.  The task is complicated by the fact that this interesting is mixed with materials that are poorly formulated simply because the authors did not give this aspect due attention.

      The third consideration is taken from the experience of contact with specialized scientific journals (from the field of physics and applied mathematics).  There is a similar situation - the authors send articles that experts assess, and decide on the results whether to accept the article as a publication or not.  Here is just a variant of one idea only, since  building a business based on it is not supposed.  Well-known magazines with a good reputation, as a rule, give a good reason for their decisions.  At least, they try to do this even in cases of relatively new directions, where it is difficult to find specialists for evaluation.  The steepness of such behavior in the case of scientific journals lies in the fact that this assessment activity lies with reviewers whose work is not motivated by anything except respect and respect of the journal editorial board - they are not paid money, because of anonymity they do not become known in this judicial field .  And the work, meanwhile, is extremely difficult - you need to delve into the considerations of others and, perhaps, also mathematical calculations, which is probably no easier than a programmer to understand the code of another programmer.  And the responsibility is great - besides the decision of someone else‚Äôs fate, the reviewer also runs his reputation in case of an error.  If the journals see the point of maintaining their status at the cost of such efforts, then, obviously, this is eventually rewarded to them - the best material is sent first of all to them.  Because, even if the author was refused, the attention shown to his work considerably mitigates his possible chagrin and they will most likely ‚Äúpart with friends‚Äù.  It seems that a similar investor strategy would bring them stable advantages in reputation. <br><br>  Anatoly Milnera <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/startup/45581.html">read</a> that there is a ‚Äúevangelist‚Äù position in large American companies.  I liked the name) Do not forget, however, also about the court magicians.  If a venture investor deals with the future, his intuition must be sharpened.  And this is purely extrasensory quality.  (Although I dislike this word).  But the fact remains that having a good psychic in the investor‚Äôs team can ease the task and increase the success in selecting the best.  Of course, sense is not an expert, but he can quickly suggest useful things about people and situations, especially in the case of expert fluctuations.  This speed is not replaced by a simple psychologist, even good.  Because a psychologist needs to see a person or know something about him, and a good sense is not necessary.  The only problem is where to find such a good one.  Apparently, this is determined by luck and fate.  However, if you do not think in this direction, then you almost certainly do not find it.  And if you think, then you never know, maybe you are lucky ... In general, this is a problem, yes.  Another problem is that large managers and people with money usually do not tolerate anyone more advanced than they are in their submission.  Do not even tolerate the cause of the case.  But this is no longer a problem with the senses. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/28696/">https://habr.com/ru/post/28696/</a></p>
