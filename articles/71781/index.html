  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hello from the Kunstkamera stereotypes or "girl in IT"! = "Guinea pig"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Prehistoric </h4><br>  It may be that the search for Habra let me down, and all this was discussed here more than once.  I even guess that all this was already really discussed, I caught karma in both directions, gained fat from holivars (thousands of them).  To IT, all this has only an indirect relation, rather, it is a question of psychology and even biology.  I often hear different things as comments on what I do.  Absolutely different - it can be just bewilderment (‚ÄúYou are a coder? But you're a girl!‚Äù), Surprise (‚ÄúHow do you manage to combine tits and html ?!‚Äù), admiration (‚ÄúYou are smart, I do not know how!‚Äù) , misunderstanding (‚ÄúWhat did you forget in the technicals? Would you like to paint yourself something?‚Äù), rejection (‚ÄúGo prepare better, it‚Äôs more to your face and the floor.‚Äù) or humiliation (‚ÄúYou are like a guinea pig you have no relation to the sea or to pigs. "). <br><br>  To the fact that not all opinions are worth paying attention to, I came before the start of my sufficient liberal education.  Being not blonde 90x60x90, but in an inverted way, she still felt in school the full power of the title of ‚Äúwhite crow‚Äù and the anger of adolescents ‚Äìwound up on those who are not lagging in their heels.  At 8-9m class, I tried to cling to this hedgehog, but it didn‚Äôt help me to become equal among them by their standards.  From the very beginning, they got used to the fact that it only makes sense for me to spread rot or beg at my homework in Russian and literature.  Since then, I didn‚Äôt need to fit into the standards, because there was no desire to feel the quintessence of stereotype. <br><br>  But I want to talk not about who such fat people are (I have a hereditary parameter), but about why it is so difficult to perceive a girl who is engaged in non-human sciences.  This is especially clearly seen in competitions of technical specialties, for example, such a university as the MATI them.  Tsiolkovsky - there are practically no girls who want to become engineers.  So it was during my mom's studies there, who still teaches iron materials, aircraft designs, etc., confidently designs in almost any CAD system (from SolidWorks to little-known and highly protected domestic developments) and is well trained in terms of computer programs in different directions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  History tour </h4><br>  Since ancient times, there is a stereotype that the breadwinner in the family is a man.  He dares, he is logical, he is strong, he is the line of power.  A woman - his support and support, his rear.  So to say, neck at the head.  Not to say that it was bad and penis carriers had to be stifled in infancy.  This is too funny and ridiculous, because nature is built on balance.  There is someone to give birth and from whom to give birth, there is a time to throw stones and collect them.  One cannot even say that having a man in power in a state is a sign of his (state) militancy.  Wars are coming because the king‚Äôs wife asked the brunet, or she will tell everyone that he is sleeping with her first adviser.  The notorious bryuli needs to be taken from somewhere, and the treasurer hangs himself in the treasury from the lack of the subject of work.

      In ancient Greece, a woman could not be an actor in an amphitheater.  In ancient Egypt, women had more rights than in Christianity, including the opportunity to become a ruler.  Nonbiological sex in antiquity was not uncommon in both sexes.  But women never went to war, never hunted, did not occupy government positions, did not do hard work like construction or blacksmithing.  In Christianity, women generally have the unenviable role of a sinner who brazenly grabbed an apple.  The world is changing, but still people have a strange attitude towards misalliance, a woman at the bench, a man in pointe shoes and many other things that have ceased to be forbidden and move.  Because stereotypes remain, absorbed practically with mother's milk in our psyche.  You cannot get rid of them in the scale of society, but you can get rid of them within yourself. <br><br><h4>  Excursion to psychology </h4><br>  If you simplify all the tricks of definitions, research and research, stereotype is a stamp.  The template on which the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa social stratum is based, about a person in this stratum, about his possible behavior, values ‚Äã‚Äãand other attributes.  A small example: <i>A person standing in front of you wears a leather jacket, grinders and is currently listening to a player.</i>  <i>If you do decide to bother him (you never know, mb is angry and mad, all in the skin, long hair, bots are such that you can kill the entire future generation with one blow) and ask what he is listening to so interesting, what answer are you waiting for ?</i>  <i>It is clearly not the name of the Israeli duo, writing a decent trance mixed with national color, said quite politely and kindly.</i> <br><br>  In the example, we encounter two aspects of behavior that are unusual for the metalhead.tpl designated by the interlocutor: in-1x, no grumbling, rumbling and rudeness, and even less a blow to the green in the groin did not follow, but in-2x, the player is not Hero of Asphalt and Not a System of a Down song about Linux encoding problems.  Exaggerated, of course, but significant.  The girl who knows how to handle the technique at a level above the capslock blondes is something unreal from the Martian series in the ‚ÄúWar of the Worlds‚Äù.  The man in the corps de ballet is necessarily a homosexual with masochistic inclinations.  The old lady writing boiling water from a new addition to Half-Life does not have a normative description in the archives of our psyche at all.  And by the way, this is a very real case from the experience of my girlfriend at the box office.  We are surprised by downshifters, we cannot understand how we can voluntarily give up a good position with good money and good prospects for even better money.  It is difficult for us to understand how people who work not in the office of Wussy Poupkine Ltd. manage to live well and successfully develop, but at home and on themselves. <br><br>  There are many things that a person does not like.  For example, a person never gets used to pain.  Danger!  The first instinct of man is self-preservation.  For him, pain is an indicator that he instinctively does something wrong, something goes wrong.  We know from childhood that you can not stick your hand into the fire, poke your fingers into the outlet.  Most of these certainly useful stamps are assimilated by us from the experience of our ancestors.  We are taught by parents, not always explaining why (however, this is a pedagogical question), we are taught by the school, the street.  They give us social stamps - you need to study for fives, higher education is a prerequisite for success, a career should only move up (or you are a sucker), a woman should give birth, prepare and wash socks, a man - get nishtyaki for sharpening. <br><br>  A person does not like to make mistakes, because often mistakes entail pain.  Not physical, so mental.  Naturally, no one likes to repeat painful mistakes, so the following similar situation causes already corrected and laid into the scheme behavior, not rolled back unnecessary sensations.  All this is systematized and subsequently practically does not change until the rooster breaks out.  These systematic lines of behavior can live for a long time, several generations, before the rooster breaks out, and the line of behavior will have to either be dramatically changed in a stressful mode, or go for all the same nakatannoy and miss by some unclear opportunity.  Many prefer to be limited to the latter. <br><br><h4>  Non standard on standard </h4><br>  Our life is subject to certain laws.  As well as the page with html-markup.  In the header, we have temperament as a title, character meta tags, style files describing the associative perception of people and life events, and scripts of their processing and behavior generation.  In the body of the document there is a markup of the main life milestones, the attendant circumstances and minor incidents with copyright copy of parents in the footer, which, according to design and usability, should be nailed to the floor.  The styles and scripts in the header, written by parents, give statics of associations and dynamics of human behavior in all tags of markup. <br><br>  After the markup originally written by parents, we are engaged in other developers, adding new markup, styles, scripts under the current conditions.  First school, then college, work, spouse (s), and then we write the pages of children.  We are both pages and developers of these pages.  We can rewrite ourselves, but not everyone is ready to rewrite, add, and generally improve the code of ourselves.  But we love to rewrite others to fit our needs, and we are even afraid to give ourselves to gurus developers aka psychologists, but even we trust them more than ourselves. <br><br>  Not every developer constantly writes something of his own, very often he uses ready-made, already written solutions by someone.  As in work with the code, so in work with the psyche (yes,% username%, this is also work, I tell you as an educator) such decisions speed up the process of project development and getting a working result.  Mental stamps piling up in the mind, moving from parents to children, and then to their grandchildren.  In portals, for example, CSS sometimes grows to a catastrophic scale ‚Äî old styles that the new developer is simply afraid to touch, so as not to bring down what is.  The volume of stereotypes of behavior is also growing, accumulating old approaches along with new dynamics. <br><br><h4>  Leading up to the topic </h4><br>  Since the appearance of the first computers "in Russia", often collected by enthusiasts from scrap materials, because they simply could not or were expensive to buy in the store, the statistics tell us one thing - men are doing it.  The girls at the computer began to appear, mostly, only in firms that computerized the workflow and transplanted their secretaries and accountants from typewriters using keyboards.  Progress is rolling - the Internet is growing, there are ICQ, chat rooms, forums.  The image of the kapslok-blonde has formed - ‚ÄúALL THE PITCH IN THIS CHATTEE!‚Äù It is possible to talk about why this image has not been diluted so far, leaving again the stereotypes of ‚Äúbeautiful fool‚Äù, ‚Äúkept woman‚Äù, ‚Äúbedding under the boss‚Äù, "The business of women to give birth" and other joys of the present and the past.  To the fact that a girl can really fumble something in IT, the post-Soviet world will not come soon.  The person is initially mentally lazy, and the Russian person generally relies for the most part on chance. <br><br>  In fact, if you delve into yourself, you can (and easily enough) come to understand that there is simply no difference between a man and a woman in professional opportunities.  And it was not.  If a person has the ability to languages, he is able to learn English, and German, and French, regardless of gender.  If a person has the ability to analyze and predict, he can play on the stock exchange without damage to the wallet, whether it is a woman or a man.  If a person can draw, he can be both an artist and an artist.  To make an amendment to the specifics of the profession is generally not necessary.  If a girl is interested in the field of web development, not only from the point of view of beautifulness, but also from the point of view of how it all should work, what internal and external relations the product of development has, then nothing prevents her from learning and speaking on a par with men. <br><br><h4>  Finalizing </h4><br>  Actually, why does the Chukchi become a writer, not just a reader?  In search of an opportunity to get an invite to Habrahabr, I ran into the website for the distribution of invitations to any resources.  In the comments to the section Habra unsubscribed girl-IT girl, asked for an invite.  It is clear that they do not like beggars, especially in closed communities, but how far did you have to go below the plinth to comment on her request with that same notorious phrase about a guinea pig?  It still jars from such a memory, although it was not addressed to me, I am not even registered on that resource.  This begs a logical question - where are you from,% username%, do you know that this girl does not write adequately in Java or does not follow the grid of computers in some form, so for 20-30 at least?  But in the course of the matter, this question begs far from everyone, and far from all is logical. <br><br>  <i>No longer relevant paragraph:</i> I do not hope for an invite, even for at least a superficial understanding of the issue raised in the post.  I have no right to teach experienced people to live, I have no right to go into someone else's life and other people's habits.  Just if someone told me (so far, the Glory of the Abode of Peace, no one has yet thought of it) that I am a guinea pig with all the consequences and my place is at the plate, and not at the html editor, this person would have lost the opportunity to continue the race.  And although there is no ... I want to get an invite before the topic about Yot goes to distant pages, because I really want to talk about the fact that in our office on New Arbat this thing works through I won‚Äôt say. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/71781/">https://habr.com/ru/post/71781/</a></p>
