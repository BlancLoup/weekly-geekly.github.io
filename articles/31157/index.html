Young people who are well versed in the Internet and who want to teach their older relatives how to find a camera or, for example, a printer can take their computer under their control and show exactly where and what is located.  The ability to transfer files gives it a completely different color. <br><br>  Today, a company from Monterey, California, has released an update that includes several new features, the most interesting of which is file sharing.  We tested it today, and everything worked perfectly ... basically.  We tried to send six different batches of files, and they all went fine, except for one time when they were stuck.  We tried again and everything went fine.  File transfer is under testing, and we believe that this bug will be fixed soon.  The transfer did not work again when we tried to start a session from a hot spot in the Starbucks center, which was probably due to the configuration of the hot spot itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/613/f01/f48/613f01f4845eee9c8667e2ec9b85ca69.jpg" width="450" height="259" hspace="10" vspace="10">

      It's simple.  You download the program (access is limited, but Crossloop allowed VentureBeat readers to download <a href="http://www.crossloop.com/3b6io3">from here</a> . Use the username "xlbeta", password "filetransfer").  As we told last time, a small panel will appear on your display (see above) with the code that needs to be transferred to the user who wants to join your computer.  After connecting, you can click on the folder icon (see fig.) And the program will allow you to select files for transfer.  You can also simply drag the necessary files from the desktop directly to the panel.  The program will request permission to transfer from each user.  You can interrupt access by clicking on the icon with the keyboard, or switch the session to yourself by clicking on the icon with the green and red arrows.  During these sessions, either of the parties can control the cursor.  The gear icon calls for help and other information about the current session.  Everything is done so that anyone can use. <br>  File transfer is based on P2P technology, and provides high speed.  If for some reason a direct connection is not possible, it will be done through the company's own servers. <br><br>  We, for the time being, do not quite understand how this can bring in money.  The vice-president for development of the company informed that their primary goal is the distribution and acceptance of the service.  And then they will introduce a fee for additional features, such as changing colors and logo on the panel. <br><br>  It should be noted that other services such as <a href="http://www.gotomypc.com/">GoToMyPC</a> and <a href="http://www.logmein.com/">LogMeIn</a> also allow users to provide remote access to their computers and share files.  However, the ability to share files is worth their money.  LogMeIn takes $ 99 a month, and GoToMyPC even more. <br><br>  The service is available in 21 languages, and data is encrypted using 128-bit technology. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.diggreader.ru/">www.diggreader.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31157/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31157/</a></p>
