  <section class="page js-page"><h1>FATF want to tighten monitoring of the payments market</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In recent years, the tightening of control over transfers has been observed in the market of electronic payments, but representatives of the Intergovernmental Group for the Development of Financial Measures to Combat Money Laundering FATF <a href="http://kommersant.ru/doc/2927983">believe</a> that this is not enough. <br><br>  This week the FATF website published a document with recommendations for risk assessment as part of financial transfers.  The main message is the assessment of high-risk operations and the risk criteria for banking payment agents.  Non-risky are companies and entrepreneurs with high capitalization, audit reports and working with translations within the country.  High-risk transactions will also include transfers made with a higher commission. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúIn practice, the FATF innovations will mean that market participants are advised not to conduct high-risk operations or consider such operations suspicious, increase control over them and send notifications to the relevant authorities (Rosfinmonitoring), but at the same time there is a risk of increased regulator attention,‚Äù says the executive Director of the National Payment Council Association, Maria Mikhailova, representatives of Kommersant. </blockquote>

      Often, the problem of identification may occur during transfers from one individual to another, if there is at least one non-resident among them.  In the absence of access to such a database, payments are still made without entering customer information. <br><br>  Among the problems, experts note the ambiguous situation with commissions - if the average market transfer fee is about 1-1.5%, in the case of mobile transfers, it often reaches 8-9%. <br><br>  But the main problem even for QIWI and other systems will remain payments from non-residents - they may not contain data about users, and FATF suggests calling such payments as suspicious. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúCustomers who are not in the database have access to services for unidentified users,‚Äù QIWI was told to Kommersant without specifying this volume. </blockquote><br><br>  Representatives of the payment system noted that such users do not include those who had previously been authenticated at the QIWI office or at one of their partner outlets. <br><br>  WebMoney has long introduced the mandatory identification of users when making any payments.  In the absence of the necessary data, users can enter them directly during the transfer, after which they are checked against the database in real time.  By analogy with WebMoney, the Yandex.Money payment service also entered. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe commission for transfers from a mobile phone account with the subsequent issuance of money in cash is associated with their categorically higher cost for the mobile operator itself (the operator often pays for replenishing the mobile account without a commission on the fact).  We will study the recommendations of FATF, but they themselves are extremely attentive to the security of payments of our customers, and everything that is prescribed by law is implemented by the company, ‚Äùthe VimpelCom (Beeline) press service reported to Kommersant. </blockquote><br><br>  In general, FATF recommendations may complicate the process of money transfer between users.  But it will be possible to evaluate the consequences only after the publication of the first draft laws written on the basis of these recommendations.  At the moment, the Central Bank and Rosfinmonitoring do not comment on the published recommendations and do not plan to automatically implement the proposed changes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299048/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299048/</a></p>
