Surely you have already heard about them: phones, telephone exchanges, IP-cameras.  Now Grandstream is entering the videoconferencing market, and this actually changes a lot for both Grandstream and the market. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/muk/blog/266879/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fed/7fe/e45/fed7fee4588e42c8b3382078ae417af3.jpg"></a> <br><br>  So, Grandstream introduced the GVC3200, a new Android-based conferencing system that would cost customers much less than competitors like LifeSize, Polycom, Cisco, etc.  This platform works on Android 4.4 (it is planned to upgrade to version 5), is capable of transmitting an image in 1080p resolution and supports up to 9 simultaneously connected participants: 4 - Full HD, 5 - HD, 9 - VGA.  The device supports connecting up to three video panels via HDMI: 2 - for video conferencing and 1 - for sharing content from a PC (VGA or HDMI).  The GVC3200 uses a PTZ camera with 12x optical zoom and supports conference services IPVideoTalkPro.  Under the cat a detailed review of the Grandstream solution and additional services for video conferencing. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c53/4f5/347/c534f5347d164eb1a97d1e49f78540f7.jpg"><br><br>  The slogan ‚ÄúThis changes everything‚Äù - ‚ÄúIt changes everything‚Äù, is said loudly, but in reality it changes if not everything, then much, and not only for Grandstream itself.  Yes, there were video telephones in the line, but these are still solutions for video calls.  For video conferencing Grandstream chose a slightly different approach - the belief in the ability to change the video conferencing market by bringing this solution to its ‚Äúnative‚Äù market segment - SMB. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e3/442/fb3/4e3442fb3d41486c80418d877f7f8ab2.jpg"><br><br>  Nowadays it is believed that video conferencing is a big, expensive and complex solution.  Therefore, Grandstream took the path of simplifying such systems in terms of use, i.e.  provided an opportunity for an ordinary office user, even without technical skills, to independently deploy and use such a solution: they took it out of the box, connected it to the TV via HDMI, connected the Internet, - that's it. <br><br>  This device is controlled by the Android OS and works on open protocols, so it is very easy to interact and integrate into existing systems.  The system supports a sufficiently large number of functions that modern users need, and about which we will tell. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#5e8bb8">Where this decision may be relevant</font> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/464/4e8/76d/4644e876d61146bfbd7d064345aa9b80.jpg"><br><br><h5>  <font color="#5e8bb8">Small companies</font> </h5><br>  First of all, as already mentioned, Grandstream plans to offer its own version of video conferencing to small companies that have several offices around the country (countries) and who need to be constantly in touch - to hold meetings and meetings, and thus reduce the costs of business trips. <br><br><h5>  <font color="#5e8bb8">Universities</font> </h5><br>  Now the topic of distance learning is actively developing.  Schools, universities, and other educational institutions that do not have large budgets, can afford it for the organization of distance learning with the effect of the presence, for example. <br><br><h5>  <font color="#5e8bb8">Telemedicine</font> </h5><br>  Grandstream already has projects, unfortunately, not yet in our region (CIS), on telemedicine, when Grandstream solutions are used to organize mobile hospitals, to transmit video for medical purposes. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#5e8bb8">Easy to use and compatible</font> </h4><br>  Usually in small companies there is no dedicated administrator who sets up the whole complex of video conferencing systems - there are no resources for this.  Such companies need a simple system that is included - it has earned.  Also, quite often you need to be able to integrate with some third-party applications, because SMB has a diverse fleet of equipment.  Something has already been bought, it's a pity to throw it away, so they keep it, etc.  This VCS solution has the ability to integrate into the already existing IT infrastructure.  However, despite the fact that this model was created for the small and medium business segment, it can be used in large companies. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#5e8bb8">Affordable</font> </h4><br>  Grandstream positions its video conferencing solutions as affordable, even in comparison with its so-called competitors.  "Chinese counterparts."  If you compare the "A" brands - the difference in price is significant (from 100% and above).  With such an approach, Grandstream wants to reverse the situation when small and medium businesses have not even thought about video conferencing due to the high cost of solutions.  Now he is quite able to afford it. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#5e8bb8">Module Description</font> </h4><br>  The GVC3200 supports Full HD resolution and has a built-in video conferencing server (MCU) ‚Äîthat is, no additional servers or additional devices are needed for video conferencing.  With the help of one such module, you can arrange a video conference from 4 Full HD participants, 5 - HD, up to 9 participants - in the standard VGA resolution of 640x480.  The module has a Full HD-controlled PTZ camera that shoots video up to 30 frames per second, with a 12x optical zoom ‚Äî this is a good enough zoom for large meeting rooms.  A good set of built-in ports and interfaces: Gigabit Ethernet port, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0 for connecting speakers and remote.  You can connect the keyboard, mouse. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d16/a54/15a/d16a5415a10c4053b8719806c9e667ca.jpg"><br><br>  As shown on the slide, it is possible to connect up to three displays to a single terminal for displaying a different image.  You can also connect a computer via the VGA or HDMI interface to show presentations in a video conference.  For video transmission, the H.264 video codec or H.264 High Profile is used to transmit higher quality voice. <br><br>  The solution comes bundled with the IPVideoTalk Pro cloud video conferencing service.  If you used to encounter Grandstream videophones (GXV3240 and GXV3275 videophones), there is also a similar IPViewTalk service.  Thus, when you turn on the phone to the Internet, you automatically receive a certain number from the Grandstream cloud service without additional settings, and you can call other similar phones by this number. <br><br>  Grandstream plans to develop a similar service for video conferencing - it will be called IPVideoTalk with the Pro prefix - more on this below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/315/ddf/9d3/315ddf9d3b5245f294feed8c38c69447.jpg"><br>  <i>The installation of the VCS module consists of only two steps:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>1 connection to the TV and audio module</i> <i><br></i>  <i>2 Internet connection</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- everything can be used.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>For comparison, an example of a guide to installing a competitor is given - the user himself does not understand.</i> <br><br><h4>  <font color="#5e8bb8">What is included?</font> </h4><br>  The system is fully ready for use "out of the box", complete with: <br>  ‚Ä¢ the module itself, which includes a video camera, video terminal, MCU and built-in microphones, <br>  ‚Ä¢ external audio module, <br>  ‚Ä¢ remote control with batteries <br>  ‚Ä¢ the necessary set of different cables, including 4 HDMI cables of different lengths for connecting three TVs and a computer, Ethernet cable <br>  ‚Ä¢ power supplies, wall mount, all necessary screws <br>  ‚Ä¢ a booklet with instructions, a cover on the camera's optics and even a napkin <br>  So in the box you get the complete solution.  You don‚Äôt have to pay for anything extra - everything comes bundled. <br><br><h4>  <b><font color="#5e8bb8">No licenses!</font></b> </h4><br>  A very important point - there are no licenses.  Neither the video resolution nor the number of conference participants is licensed.  By paying a fixed amount, you get a solution with a free lifetime software update, with a guarantee that is provided in accordance with the laws of the country (as a rule, this is 1 year as a standard). <br><br><h4>  <font color="#5e8bb8">Grandstream IP Video Talk Pro Cloud Service</font> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d30/024/8e1/d300248e168942c09a973ce032e5ab5d.jpg"><br><br>  Suppose you have several offices in different cities.  In each office, you put on the terminal, included in the Internet.  The terminal automatically received a unique number from the Grandstream IPVideoTalk Pro cloud service, and you can already call this unique number.  It's simple. <br><br>  No need to install additional telephone exchanges, configure routers, etc.  This is the basic functionality of this service.  In the future, Grandstream plans to expand this service, additional services will probably be by subscription, but this later, since at the moment it is still in development.  But the free service of providing numbers for a simplified call is already working. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#5e8bb8">Interfaces</font> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a33/1ea/a1c/a331eaa1c7a141d9a917012929affb62.jpg"><br><br>  The system consists of one module, that is, it is all-in-one, 3 HDMI ports for connecting TVs, VGA or HDMI for connecting a computer.  SD slot for recording video conversations, two USB ports, one for connecting an external audio system, another for connecting a mouse, keyboard, flash drive (that is, you can connect everything that is supported by the Android system), one gigabit LAN port, a connector for the unit power supply.  There is also a built-in Wi-Fi n-standard module and two microphones on the front side. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#5e8bb8">Integration with third-party systems</font> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d05/c47/05a/d05c4705a4b84eeb9c147e6d5627f6c6.jpg"><br><br>  GVC3200 can be used as a SIP client of an existing system of manufacturers listed on the slide - LifeSize, Cisco, Polycom, etc.  Grandstream in its releases reports on testing with different systems, and can send the results of these tests upon request. <br><br>  The solution can work with third-party cloud-based SIP services, such as BlueJeans.  By the way, BlueJeans is a video conferencing system, a cloud service for multipoint conference.  This is a paid service, but his account is already integrated and pre-configured in the GVC module as well as IpVideoTalkPro, that is, if you want to become a BlueJeans subscriber, you can immediately start using this service. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#5e8bb8">Remote control</font> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/665/604/043/6656040435de48d38e1544afcb72d234.jpg"><br><br>  To control all this business uses a Bluetooth remote.  The fact that it is not infrared is quite convenient - you do not need to constantly send it directly to the terminal.  Bluetooth version 4.0 is used, in the upper part there is a touch panel for cursor control.  Powered by AAA batteries.  Works at a distance of 10 m. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bd6/1cd/7a1/bd61cd7a1bb343eeafd251ca9b170183.jpg"><br><br>  There is also an Android application that allows you to use any Android device as a remote, for example, your smartphone.  You can scan the QR code from the screen that leads to the application download page. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/355/63f/8f7/35563f8f7f004b149a80f28432ecbebc.jpg"><br><br>  There is also the ability to control GVC via the web interface.  You can go to the IP address, open the web interface, and all the functions of the console are also available: dialing, turning, presets, and so on.  This may be necessary if the conference is held in a large hall and a separate operator controls the system. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#5e8bb8">Google Play apps</font> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d1/246/2fb/8d12462fbc254d839ccd131c7e148586.jpg"><br><br>  Since the entire system runs on Android and is registered in the Google Play app store, it becomes very easy to install and work with third-party applications.  This is of course Skype, and further down the list: Google Hangouts, Microsoft Lync, etc., that is, everything that works on Android smartphones can be tried. <br><br>  It is also revolutionary that Skype, Hangouts and Lync subscribers can be connected to video conferencing along with other SIP participants.  However, today it is possible to attach only one such participant and there is a small nuance: the participant with Skype and the organizer will see and hear all the participants of the conference, while remote SIP participants can only hear the participant on Skype. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#5e8bb8">SDK available</font> </h4><br>  An SDK is available for customers who write their applications and use them on video conferencing systems.  Thus, it is possible to develop your own Android application. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#5e8bb8">SIP video phones</font> </h4><br>  As already mentioned, the solution works in any SIP network, if it supports video calls. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/778/a6a/5c7/778a6a5c78a94ffd9ec33bb7c3814380.png"><br><br>  The GVC Grandstream VKS system naturally integrates with its native Grandstream GXV3275 and GXV3240 videophones, which can be used as clients in video conferencing.  Plus, the manufacturer has a GrandstreamWave softphone, which is currently available for Android.  It is planned that the softphone will support video and will also work on Apple devices. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#5e8bb8">Video mixing</font> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4fb/d89/14a/4fbd8914afef421682b153378b5bb52c.jpg"><br><br>  The competitors in the basic solution if one of the participants connected in a low resolution, for example CIF, then all participants automatically switch to a low resolution.  To avoid this, you need to buy an expensive license.  Video streaming in VC Grandstream is free of charge, which also pleases. <br><br>  If a participant with a lower resolution connects to the conference, it will not affect other participants.  The system is able to combine different streams: one window will be in CIF resolution, for example, another window will be in Full HD resolution, and, in any case, with different types of streams from different devices, these streams will not affect each other. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#5e8bb8">Network bandwidth requirements</font> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/03d/d3b/f12/03dd3bf12f1e43dca3692a5729d5a0bd.jpg"><br><br>  The minimum channel width for each participant with Full HD stream is 1 megabit.  With HD resolution - 500 kilobits per second and VGA - 385 kbps at a stream of 30 frames per second.  The stream at the collection point of the videoconference is equal to the sum of all streams. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/491/409/b1a/491409b1afa74aef9c1dec594f8abbe2.jpg"><br><br>  If necessary, if there is a good channel, you can increase the bitrate, and then the same Full HD stream can be increased to 4 megabits, this will be the best picture quality and detail.  Ease of use, image resolution, image detailing ‚Äî all these things are quite subjective, so customers can easily agree and take the system from the distributor for a test before purchasing to make sure the conference is operating normally under the existing conditions. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#5e8bb8">Presentations</font> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/117/a31/f7c/117a31f7ce2b44ffb5dfd2cd85048ea4.jpg"><br><br>  The system allows you to connect your computer to show content, for example, to send a Power Point presentation during a video conference.  The speaker connects via HDMI or VGA, the presentation is turned on / off by pressing a button on the remote. <br><br><h5>  <font color="#5e8bb8">How the presentation system works</font> </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6c9/059/061/6c90590612cc4e7f8b397b2e8bd93480.jpg"><br><br>  The presentation is transmitted as a separate stream using the open standard BFCP protocol for the transfer of presentations.  This BFCP protocol must be supported on the server (telephone exchange) and the terminals of the other participants must be able to play in Full HD resolution.  A good feature of the GXV3200 is that the presentation is transmitted at up to 15 frames per second.  Most competitive systems transmit a presentation at 5 frames per second, so you can only transfer a static image.  When transferring 15 frames per second, it becomes possible to embed a video, for example, a desktop demonstration, etc.  Most likely, the discontinuity will still be, but the overall image will be smooth - there will be no annoying mouse jumps. <br><br>  Grandstream telephone exchanges and the IPVideoTalk cloud server support the BFCP protocol.  During the demonstration, you can choose various options for how you want your presentation to look: only a presentation, a presentation + people, etc. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#5e8bb8">Audio module</font> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/29a/fb3/b4b/29afb3b4b80a4b00b9c1c47a07fdb2c0.jpg"><br><br>  The main module has built-in microphones, but they are quite simple and operate within 2-3 meters.  Therefore, it comes with a separate OEM audio module from InFocus.  This is a desktop speaker that contains four microphones and a speaker.  It can be connected to a video conference via usb, or via Bluetooth, if you want to have fewer cables. <br><br>  By Bluetooth, you can also connect any third-party speaker with additional microphones, if you do not like the speaker that comes in the kit.  Also, if the customer already has a terminal on the table, it can be connected via Bluetooth or USB to the Grandstream videoconferencing system.  This quarter, Grandstream is planning to release its GAC 2200 conference phone - the announcement on the slide below is about this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0d3/101/bd8/0d3101bd82f14a80b38696a483dd2eed.jpg"><br><br><h5>  <font color="#5e8bb8">Calling options</font> <br>  You can call other devices in different ways: <br>  - normal SIP call when you dial another subscriber <br>  - using IpVideoTalkPro account dial the number that was automatically received by another module <br>  - call by IP address directly to the device bypassing the SIP server <br>  - call to application <br>  - and, finally, it is possible to make a voice call to any number <br><br></h5><h5>  <font color="#5e8bb8">Functions during a call:</font> <br>  - ability to add / remove users <br>  - give / take the right to vote <br>  - enable / disable camera <br>  - mixing video calls from third-party applications to our SIP videoconference <br>  - turn on / off the presentation (both the presenter and the participants of the conference can do this) <br><br></h5><h5>  <font color="#5e8bb8">Add members via third-party applications</font> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/182/53d/dc1/18253ddc1d5547ae85840ac782b445fa.jpg"><br><br>  If you need to call a subscriber on Skype, or on some other application, during the conference you select the menu "third-party application" and call the right one - Google Hangouts, Skype or Lync, etc.  Call the desired user, and this user is connected to the conference. <br><br></h5><h4>  <font color="#5e8bb8">Instruments</font> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ea/38e/64a/5ea38e64aa274897bd8f69f267e57b76.jpg"><br><br>  The system has a built-in channel monitoring function that shows the speed, frame rate, packet loss, picture resolution and voice parameters for each stream in both directions and right during operation.  There are also other tools that help in setting up and solving problems - among them there is a test measurement of the speed of connection to the Internet, logging of ip packets.  In addition, you can install a large number of useful tools with Google Play <br><br></h4><h4>  <b><font color="#5e8bb8">Recording conversations and conferences (without a license!</font> )</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f41/d85/ce7/f41d85ce7f9547b8a700a82161723643.jpg"><br><br>  In our opinion, this is a very cool feature with which Grandstream will consolidate its entry into the video conferencing market - recording video conferences.  All Grandstream competitors use separate servers for this.  Here you can insert the SD card into the terminal itself, press one button on the remote, and the system will start recording the video conference on the SD card.  Then you can download a video conference recording using the web interface. <br><br>  What is very important, this function <b>does not require any additional licenses</b> and additional servers, only a large SD card is needed (up to 32 GB is supported and the manufacturer promises to increase this parameter). <br><br></h4><h4>  <font color="#5e8bb8">Does the camera turn to sound?</font> <br>  Grandstream does not have such a function, in view of the fact that competing solutions of this kind, when the camera itself should automatically turn to sound, do not always work out correctly, the equipment often does not understand which side the speaker is from. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f2/79c/0a7/1f279c0a76024e23b5f434b213007b8c.jpg"><br><br>  Therefore, the manufacturer has solved this problem through the presets.  You program in advance the directions to which the camera will be directed.  When a particular person starts speaking, the operator presses the button of the corresponding preset number on the remote and the camera automatically switches to it.  Such presets can be up to 24. <br><br>  Presets can be controlled as a remote control, by pressing a certain button, or through a web interface.  The operator can select the desired preset via the web interface and direct the camera.  Also, if necessary, you can manually set or correct the zoom and rotation of the camera. <br><br></h4><h4>  <font color="#5e8bb8">Planning</font> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c57/8eb/91c/c578eb91c2604742acaf39a717000c5c.jpg"><br><br>  When you are planning a conference for the future, there is a mechanism for automatically organizing events.  Specify the parameters: name, time, date, number of participants and numbers of these participants.  At the appointed time, ‚ÄúH‚Äù the system will automatically start a video conference and call all participants.  Integration with the corporate calendar is possible, - the rest of the staff will see that, for example, today, at one o'clock, the negotiation is busy, as there is such a conference. <br><br></h4><h4>  <font color="#5e8bb8">Speed ‚Äã‚Äãtest ookla</font> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c5/751/63d/9c575163d59b4c609de156139ba33ee0.jpg"><br><br>  If the terminal needs to be quickly installed in a new place, you need to know the quality of the Internet connection.  Grandstream developers immediately integrated the Ookla Speedtest application.  You do not even need to install it separately from the Google Play market. <br><br>  This is very convenient even to demonstrate the solution to the customer.  Already at the stage of product demonstration you can make all the necessary measurements of the customer's infrastructure: - what is the channel of the customer?  - Is it suitable for video conferencing?  - what needs to be changed to install VKS?  Etc. <br><br></h4><h4>  <font color="#5e8bb8">findings</font> <br>  In our opinion, Grandstream has significantly expanded its portfolio, complementing it with a solution for organizing videoconferences.  Now the customer can receive not only telephony, but also video conferencing from one hand and, most importantly, without additional licenses.
