  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Master or work?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello.  According to statistics, at Habr√© there are quite a lot of people who are students, and also want to build their careers in the field of software development.  Therefore, I decided to write an article in which I discuss a little about the advantages of work and the magistracy, and also try to evaluate each of these options. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, we finish a bachelor degree in Russia.  Over the years we have become acquainted with the basics of mathematical analysis, linear algebra, discrete mathematics, mathematical logic, the theory of probability, and statistics.  In addition, we learned the basic algorithms and data structures, touched electronics / artificial intelligence / data processing / databases / something else specialized.  We also completed several course projects, thus studying a couple of new modern "trend" technologies (Node.JS, MV * javascript frameworks, NoSQL, JavaEE / Spring, ASP.NET MVC, QT, Xamarin, etc.).  In general, we received intro in those areas that are interesting to us. <br><br>  Also, do not forget that some of us have already gained work experience.  At least, everyone had summer internships / practices that allowed them to see how adult guys work. <br><br>  Let us summarize what we, the average students, are after graduation.  I think we are ordinary juniors in the area in which they specialized and carried out their term papers.

    <h4>  The first path - Master </h4><br>  Let's evaluate the advantages of the magistracy.  <b>Master's is:</b> <br><ul><li>  Higher degree; </li><li>  More serious theoretical knowledge; </li><li>  Two years that you can spend on something of your own (start-up, reading books, etc.); </li><li>  Simplification of emigration to some countries (to Canada, for example); </li><li>  Opportunity to move to Europe / USA with the help of a magistracy; </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Higher academic degree.</b>  It is believed that in Russia for a long time bachelors will be ‚Äúshort graduates‚Äù.  It is also considered that soon all vacancies (not in IT firms) will include the item ‚ÄúMD required‚Äù and not ‚Äúhigher education required‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Pros for:</b> <br><ul><li>  It may well be that such a demand will appear: in Russia everything is changing rapidly; </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Arguments against:</b> <br><ul><li>  Guys, do you want to be programmers?  The maximum that is now in vacancies is a requirement of higher education.  No one writes about the magistracy.  For interest, you can open Western jobs, there in 99% of vacancies indicated the requirement of BD, and not MD.  We remember that the main thing is experience and skills, and not a crust. </li><li>  It is believed that MD is needed only to develop in the direction of the scientist.  MD is a necessity for entering PhD. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>More serious theoretical knowledge.</b>  Indeed, in some universities you can pump well.  This is the Academic University in St. Petersburg, these are the programs of Yandex and ABBYY Lingvo in Moscow, this is the Master's program in Kontur in Yekaterinburg.  However, unfortunately, the majority of magistracies do not pump over you additionally.  Therefore, if you can enroll in the above programs - act, it will only benefit.  Otherwise, I attribute this clause to the arguments ‚Äúagainst‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Two years that you can spend on something of your own.</b>  Indeed, this time you have.  But is it true that all graduates are future CEOs / cofounders?  What then prevented you from doing your project during a bachelor degree?  Roughly speaking, the point is rather controversial, and it is individual for each of us. <br><br>  <b>Simplification of emigration to some countries.</b>  This item is clearly in the piggy bank "for" the magistracy.  If you want to move - think about this item.  While there is enough BD to move, but what will happen next is not clear. <br><br>  <b>The opportunity to move to Europe / USA with the help of a magistracy.</b>  Again, the point goes to the piggy bank for the magistracy.  If you can enroll in a foreign magistracy, then even nothing to think about - act! <br><br>  <b>Now for the cons:</b> <br><ul><li>  There is no possibility to work 40 hours a week (or it will be extremely difficult); </li><li>  A waste of two years of life: no one will appreciate MD, but will have to do a lot of formal things (GOSy on philosophy, explanatory note for a thesis on GOST, teaching activity). </li></ul><br><br>  <b>There is no possibility to work 40 hours a week.</b>  Many combine work and study in a magistracy.  However, is it convenient?  Working 20 hours, we do not get all the experience, and also have a smaller list of companies where we can work.  Working 40 hours, we practically do not appear at school: and then the meaning of admission (entered - learn!). <br><br>  <b>A waste of two years of life.</b>  This item is controversial.  Depends on where we can go.  The point echoes the more serious theoretical knowledge (one of the advantages of the magistracy). <br><br>  To summarize the option - to study in the magistracy.  If we can enter a decent place where you can really draw knowledge - then this is a really good option.  As a bonus, we get a move to another country (if this magistracy is not in Russia), or some bonus for emigration (if this magistracy is in Russia).  As another bonus (true, small) - improving the "crusts".  Otherwise, the magistracy is a very doubtful occupation, which will not allow you to start building a career (and go to the rank of middles in those two years of the magistracy). <br><br><h4>  The second way - Work </h4><br>  Let us go straight to the advantages of the choice of Work, as a further stage of development after the bachelor degree.  So <b>work is:</b> <br><ul><li>  Opportunity to grow from junior to middle in 2 years; </li><li>  Salary; </li><li>  The absence of the formal routine, which is in the institute; </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Opportunity to grow from junior to middling in 2 years.</b>  During this time, you will improve your practical skills.  This will allow you to go to the next level, moving from simple tasks (which usually come to the junior), to more interesting ones. <br><br>  <b>Salary.</b>  Very doubtful point for the programmer.  Who wants money - has long been at the moment (good, no one has canceled freelancing). <br><br>  <b>Lack of a formal routine.</b>  If you are lucky enough to get a normal company, then, most likely, you will forget how to write numerous reports, and even more so such nasty word as Gosts and Standards. <br><br>  <b>Minuses of work:</b> <br><ul><li>  No MD; </li><li>  Emigration to another country may be complicated; </li></ul><br><br>  <b>No MD.</b>  This item we have already discussed in the section related to the magistracy.  Here everyone has to decide for himself whether he will receive advantages from MD and a steeper crust. <br><br>  <b>Emigration to another country may be complicated.</b>  Yes, probably, this is true.  For example, when moving to Canada, MD in front of BD will bring you a few extra points in the competition. <br><br>  So, as we can see, the pros and cons of the work are almost the opposite of the pros and cons of the magistracy (which is logical when choosing from two orthogonal options).  The work will allow us to grow faster as engineers, but it will completely ruin a career in the university (and, a lot of places, and in R &amp; D) science.  Is it scary - everyone decides it himself. <br><br>  Let's summarize the article.  The pros and cons, both of the work and of the magistracy, are very obvious.  Work is a real experience.  Learning is a crust and, possibly, theoretical knowledge.  What is better - just choose you. <br><br>  It would be interesting to hear your comments in the comments.  If you are a manager, do you look at the degree, or is it only important for you to have it?  If you are an employee, have you often been asked what degree you have, or were you settled solely because of your knowledge and experience. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/226355/">https://habr.com/ru/post/226355/</a></p>
