Other people's mistakes are your advantages.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  An analysis of the competitive environment in the market can produce stunning results.  Weaknesses of competitors can easily be turned into advantages of your offer.  You may be amazed by the reality of the competition of the chosen market, and in some cases, solely on the weakness of competitors, without inventing anything personally, to create a unique UTP for the market. <br><br>  Any store has a weak spot.  Even Ozone, up to a certain time, had a problem with customer feedback, which resulted in 20% of failures.  What to say about less developed stores. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h5>  What should be the analysis of online shopping competitors? <br></h5><br>  <b>First</b> , the analysis must be done before you begin to enter information about products, draw design and customize your store.  Naturally, after you decide what product you will sell. <br><br>  Why?  It's simple. <br><br>  Analysis allows you to figure out how to organize the store is not worth it, and how to submit information on the site.  It is much easier to do it right than to correct the mistakes, right? <br><br>  For example, about the information among 5 sites with mobile phones, I did not find even a hint of <a href="http://www.nezname.com/%3Fp%3D13">audience segmentation</a> .  That is, if I‚Äôm looking for a business phone, I‚Äôll have to scroll through the entire catalog page in order to determine from the photograph that this phone is suitable for a business person.  What to speak about the characteristics needed by a businessman - the search may drag on very much. <br><br>  What to say about the design problems that affect 90% of all stores. <br><br>  <b>Second</b> , make a list in advance of the criteria by which you will judge the sites of competitors. <br><br>  What for? <br><br>  Because, being carried away by the process, some important criterion of site evaluation can easily fly out of my head.  And only thinking that it is important to evaluate, you can take into account all the necessary criteria.  True, anyway in the course of the analysis, add a couple to the list. <br><br>  A list can help.  First, what should be the site: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Simple; <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Convenient; <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Informative; <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Pleasant to the eye. <br><br>  Criteria for assessing information on the site: <br><br>  1. Transparent delivery and payment terms.  The brevity and clarity of their presentation; <br><br>  2. Loyalty program (stock discounts); <br><br>  3. Site navigation, convenience of the directory structure; <br><br>  4. Readability of the selling texts; <br><br>  5. The process of placing an order; <br><br>  6. Quality of information on the product page; <br><br>  7. The quality of the site support service; <br><br>  8. Pricing. <br><br>  Could miss something, so complement me if you come up with something important. <br><br>  In general, your feelings as a customer are important.  Pretend to be new to online shopping, and completely unaware of the product.  Go through the sites, write down all the thoughts that come to mind on a piece of paper in a column.  Think over them, abstract as much as possible from the subjectivity of your perception - I am sure that you will immediately cross out some of them.  Number on a scale of importance for the client and run according to the list of criteria, so that for each item you get a list of minuses of other stores. <br><br><h5>  What to do with the list? <br></h5><br>  If you ask such a question, think, is it worth it to create a store? <br><br><h5>  "Contraindications" </h5><br><br>  But I would also like to caution to draw hasty conclusions.  Here, too, the well-known proverb warns, and it is necessary to think about ways to turn other people's mistakes into their advantages thoughtfully. <br><br>  In some cases, there is a causal link that is not visible to the naked eye.  For example, a colorful ad unit on the product page in a prominent place, intriguing visitors to click on it.  It may seem to some that it is cool, and in fact interrupts orders. <br><br>  Undoubtedly, to conduct a good audit, you need the skills of Internet marketing.  Whatever the personal feelings, and no matter how objectively you try to approach the assessment, there are statistics, a psychology of human behavior and other wisdom.  In addition, the amount of experience and knowledge may be insufficient to identify all the disadvantages, look deeper than the confusing text about the conditions of delivery.  And most importantly find the right solution or application for your site. <br><br>  Almost the same thing, how to diagnose a patient and not be a therapist. <br><br><h5>  Personal experience </h5><br><br>  When I collected information about tenant companies for the article: ‚Äú <a href="http://www.nezname.com/%3Fp%3D564">Everything about renting online stores,</a> ‚Äù I noticed a bunch of flaws and unrealized opportunities in the information submitted through the site.  Honestly, I was amazed at how many most tenants, poorly inform potential customers about their offer.  Elementally reading the necessary information to form an opinion on the service, I compiled an approximate list of problems in my mind and came up with what was worth giving and even to attract clients to my proposal.  You can <a href="http://www.nezname.com/%3Fp%3D601">see how much information</a> I got to collect from sites. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/61657/">https://habr.com/ru/post/61657/</a></p>
