Details are changing, and it is this that ultimately creates the feeling that the product is completely different. <br><br>  Recently I was approached by an audit company that needed a new website.  In this regard, we could not find a compromise, however, the company and its team ‚Äúhooked‚Äù me and I took upon myself one of the most interesting and exclusive areas - torenic (financial investigations at enterprises). <br><br>  Describing the site, I can not tell you in detail about the process of its creation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Product </h5><br>  Forensic is a little-known service, the demand for which in Russia, judging by the statistics of search engines, is scanty.  But to solve the problem of bringing a new product to the market is at least interesting and useful for the mind.

      We talked closely with the head of the company, the ‚Äútop‚Äù of the manager.  I saw on the table of the director a book of Ural Suleimanov ‚ÄúRules for hunting rats‚Äù on how to determine theft in an enterprise and what can be done about it.  As a result, took to read. <br><br>  The book itself is unique.  It is interestingly written, there are many comparisons and allegories about rats and thieves, many examples and effective methods for determining the causes of theft. <br><br>  According to the head of the company, the book was purchased in the department of discounted goods, which in itself already speaks of the demand for the service. <br><br>  The book is undoubtedly useful.  However, it was written in a very tough, sometimes shocking style, when sometimes you feel uncomfortable and you think whether you are doing the right thing at certain moments. <br><br>  When it came back to the site, I suggested using the very ‚Äúformat‚Äù that I spoke about at the very beginning: a well thought out structure, navigation, correct and convincing materials, nice design ... <br><br>  But all this was not so, so I left this task for a while and waited for the solution to come by itself.  Our ‚Äúthinking machine‚Äù will still be processing the necessary information in the background. <br><br><h5>  Idea </h5><br>  Explain the essence of the financial investigation services so that you want to trust the performer, can only be through conversation or dialogue. <br><br>  And then I remembered an article written by the head of this company for one federal publication, which he showed me at the first meeting. <br><br>  This material was written in a very vital way, with examples and humor, therefore it was interesting and credible to the authors.  I read the article in just 15 minutes. <br><br>  In fact, it was the other side of the ‚ÄúRules ...‚Äù, with the correct presentation for the owners of the enterprise.  Namely, the proprietors are the main consumers of forensic. <br><br>  <b>It seemed to me that this could be the basis of the entire site.</b>  <b>Dialogue with the site visitor through the article.</b> <br><br>  The article was ready and well structured.  But the Internet always requires refinement of what comes out in print. <br><br>  I printed out the article, studied the material more carefully, determined how the final material should be structured and decorated, cut and ‚Äúsqueezed‚Äù some blocks. <br><br>  The result was a ready-made entertaining web text that can be read from the screen in 12-13 minutes with a cup of coffee at lunchtime. <br><br>  But this is certainly not enough. <br><br>  I began to look for good options for submitting articles on the Internet.  A good solution for me seemed to be sliders.  I am not a designer, so I could only sketch a layout on a modular grid. <br><br>  <b>The site has just been uploaded, but the layout is being finalized.</b>  <b>There are some "shoals."</b> <br><br>  I decided that for an experimental solution this is still sufficient: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/ecbb564d/18d41516/422e0928/1f347766.jpg"><br><br>  References from ‚ÄúWe know the reasons for the theft and how to deal with them‚Äù lead to pages about the company, why everything happens and what can be done about it, i.e.  about the service. <br><br>  In the event that the behavior of visitors shows that my idea was successful, we will make a more correct and professional design. <br><br><h5>  The experiment and the desired result </h5><br>  Here's what happened: <a href="http://forenzik.ru.nyud.net/">www.forenzik.ru</a> (I know that this word is written wrong in a bourgeois way; the <b>link leads to a site cast so that the main one does not fall</b> ). <br><br>  To attract the audience are used: <br><ul><li>  contextual advertising </li><li>  search promotion </li><li>  publication of articles on specialized sites dedicated to the services of auditing companies </li></ul><br>  It is clear that for me the most important result will be customer calls, but still interesting: <br>  <b>Does anyone finish reading what I have done?</b> <br><br>  This is only 12-13 minutes of really entertaining reading, and there are quite a few business owners among habrayusers. <br><br>  I would be happy to comment on the design, fonts and other things. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129102/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129102/</a></p>
