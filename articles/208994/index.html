      <br>
      To begin with, let's understand exactly how we exchange information.  In order to transfer your knowledge there are two options. <br><br>  The first is to create some kind of basis that will serve as the basis.  That is, to create a set of entities, determine their properties and take it all as a point of reference.  To make it clearer.  The basis is the axioms on which geometry is built, numerical calculus on which mathematics is built, etc.  This option was used to create a language, then religion, then science.  What is he bad?  The fact that if over time does not ensure continuity, then the original content will be lost and only the empty form will remain, which is essentially dead, because  does not reflect the original properties of the entity.  And it turns out that we seem to be speaking the same language, but in fact we do not understand each other, because  we see different content behind the same forms.  Such a problem arose in almost all natural sciences.  There mathematics, which was invented for the rapid assessment of quantitative characteristics, formed the basis.  And we argue about derivatives, integrals, infinitely small and infinitely large quantities, often without understanding their physical meaning.  Moreover, on these very abstract models we are trying to build more complex and therefore the data obtained do not reflect reality.  But instead of realizing our mistakes, we strenuously force reality into these ideal, but dead, models.  Consciously complicate very simple things. <br><br>  The second option is to use the existing concepts, which are the most accurate analogues of the described entities.  At the same time, assumptions are made in order to focus on the basic properties, leaving less significant ones in parentheses.  This is called a generalization.  Again, an example to make it clearer.  In order to explain to the child what the path of least resistance in an electrical circuit is, the following analogy can be used.  Conductors are tubes, electric current is water flowing through them.  Water will always choose the shortest path, flowing through the system of pipes, with the same current.  And the child who can not imagine or see the current, the analogy will be clear. <br><br>  In order to follow the first path, it is necessary to organize a new direction in science, a new religious denomination, etc.  All this is very long and will live only as long as there is a person standing at the source, or a person who received information from him in its entirety.  Therefore, we use the second.  Immediately make a reservation that you should not get hung up on forms.  Pails and stones can be easily replaced with a plastic bag and coins.  What matters here is what lies behind the external form.  The forms are chosen in such a way that they are understood by as many people as possible with technical education.  Well, of course, that the analogies will be completely incomprehensible to a person with a humanitarian mindset.  And this must be taken into account. <br><br>  So how is everything arranged? <br><br>  The most important organ is the brain.  He is responsible for ensuring all <b>physical</b> processes.  It consists of two parts: the right and left hemispheres.  The first is responsible for logic, abstraction and generalization and is called thinking.  With its help, we exchange information, structure it, summarize it and create complex systems on this basis.  The second is responsible for the images and is called intuition.  It is here that there are different insights in the form of a dream table of chemical elements or the solution of a complex task, over which one can unsuccessfully fight for a long time.  At the level of abstractions, we have at our disposal two computers.  One regular digital, which very slowly processes a large amount of source data and uses hash tables (as a pattern of thinking) for acceleration, but does not always produce the best answers, but is easy to use.  The second is analog, which is able to very quickly solve systems of differential equations of high order, but the answer is given in the form of not always clear graphs.  In addition, we do not understand exactly how to provide it with the necessary input data and principles of its work.  In the majority of women, the left hemisphere is most developed, in men, the right one.  Hence, all the funny stories about "female logic" and the cause of conflicts between representatives of different sexes.  A strong bias on either side causes various mental illnesses and personality disorders.  The physical separation of the hemispheres by the operation on the corpus callosum is guaranteed to lead to the appearance of two different personalities in one person. <br><br>  Since the brain is the most important organ, it must be very well protected from hacking.  Therefore, it is based on a set of basic programs that are responsible for breathing, heartbeat, digestion of food in order to extract energy, immunity, etc.  This is the hardware level and the possibility of intervention is almost eliminated, because  faces very serious consequences. <br><br>  The application programs are located at a higher level, some of which are transmitted to us in the form of gene information, and some of them are created by us in the learning process.  This, for example, the ability to walk on two legs, talk, etc.  It is these formed chains that are patterns of thinking.  When a person learns to walk, he controls this process first.  As the chain hardens, this process is less and less controlled by consciousness.  That is, its formation is the goal of learning. <br><br>  Consciousness is even higher.  This is a metaprogram that is able to control brain activity and create neural connections (programs like the base one) in the learning process to facilitate brain activity. <br><br>  But all this can be taught and animals.  How does a person differ from them? <br><br>  And here we come to the most important thing.  Above all this is an important component that is absent in animals.  We call it the function of evaluating our own actions.  It is implemented as a function with an infinite number of inputs and one single output.  Its purpose is to accept all available source information (including future predictions of consequences) for input and to give an answer whether this is the correct action or not.  It was difficult here, so I‚Äôll give an example.  An animal (even a predator) will never attack unless necessary.  For this to happen some event: either hunger or aggression from the side.  A man can just for the sake of pleasure kill animals.  Immediately make a reservation that this is not about the moral side of the issue, but rather about the rationality of such actions.  In the same way, a person can perform some kind of disinterested action without the slightest benefit for himself, but simply to make another pleasant.  No animal is capable of this, and the care of the offspring is just a basic program at the hardware level.  That is why, when we offend someone, we begin to ‚Äútorture the conscience.‚Äù  This is due to the fact that the evaluation function characterizes the action as incorrect. <br><br>  To make the above more understandable, I‚Äôll give a picture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/09d/33a/11f/09d33a11fb241eab49e233dcaf826189.png"><br><br>  I think that while the information is enough. <br><br>  And finally.  We all know perfectly well that the current always flows along the path of least resistance.  The physical model of our brain is just an analogue of such a network, where synaptic connections between neurons are conductors, neurons are the elements that make up the network, brain activity is electrical current.  Therefore, the brain, when generating a control signal, searches for the shortest branch of the entire decision tree in order to ensure maximum energy efficiency of the process.  The patterns of our thinking are just such branches, and the task of consciousness in time to understand that the patterns are outdated, eliminate unnecessary and create new ones.  And this process is infinite as well as knowledge itself and development. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/208994/">https://habr.com/ru/post/208994/</a></p>
