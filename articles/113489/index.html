So that as a result we can extract (ie, read) and use (apply) the knowledge moving in this process. <br><br>  We have more and more powerful computers and video cards, more and more wide monitors and fast browsers.  And at the same time we have constantly frozen forms of messages, answers, citations.  Only search engines and search functions slightly violate the established order of messages, producing results on the ranking of viewing conditions. <br><br>  It's not even about search engines.  We do not have the functions of convenient presentation and rearrangement of the representations of selected messages or their parts. 
      <br>

      <br>
      There is a list.  There is a tree that is not very convenient due to the two-dimensionality of the branches.  And there are many, many, almost identical type of representation converters into a readable form ‚Äî forums, blogs, and social networks. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It is high time to think and depict thoughts at the level of blocks of knowledge composed of thoughts and knowledge from different people.  To take them as they are and make up of what is, for example, in the same blogs.  Then add your own and check associations to search for similar thoughts.  But there is no tool for a unified and convenient representation of both others and their knowledge.  Yes, some are costing paper, diaries, books, Word, Notepad.  And the way they continue with these particles of experience is the magic of the action, each with its own. <br><br>  If at least for part of the information to improve the process of presenting on the screen, so that it is faster and easier to immerse in the further magic of the action - a lot of routine work on torsion of the mouse will disappear in numerous forums, news and even books.  We have a system for presenting knowledge in the form of book chapters or HTML book chapters with media inserts, but there is no tool for working with the information presented - everything is hidden in the magic of brain activity that everyone generates as he can. <br><br><h2>  Who needs it? </h2><br>  Yes, all this intense brain activity, for the sake of which we want to prepare informational food and the way it is prepared, is needed for very different purposes.  To whom - to have a rest from difficult work, to whom on the contrary - to load the brain with sequences and conclusions.  And who - just think of another post in the section "Abnormal programming". <br><br>  Most likely, the one who will receive the complete mechanism of work with information, now scattered in numerous books and programs, will benefit.  Plus, with the experience of neighbors and teachers, of course.  The mentioned forum engines are a very remote resemblance to the system being sought, even if there the quality of information is lower than the large author writings.  But they are presented as a prototype of the process of interaction between the thoughts of different authors, and therefore of different sources of information. <br><br><h2>  What prevents ideas from shooting? </h2><br>  It is hard to imagine that the forum engine will be able to turn the wheel of history.  Why not?  The paper on which the books were written, on which the same different ideas collided and translated into thoughts and deeds ‚Äî also turned the story.  And while, it must be admitted, it is more effective than its electronic substitutes. <br><br>  If you think about it, then probably one of the hindrances is that electronic information in the space of computer worlds (so to speak, let's call all the many screen impressions on which knowledge and books can be displayed and other creators' achievements) does not seem to be reliable.  Servers can be turned off, computers can break down, and the forum administration will take, and even close the page of civilians talking about Sberbank and destroy the process of crystallization of knowledge.  Vandals, in short, everywhere.  And only manuscripts do not burn.  Ideas placed in logical minds capture minds. <br><br>  We need a tool to crystallize ideas, independent of the effects of everything.  Paradoxically, it sounds.  You expressed the idea.  Placing it on the forum - you risk losing it by technical failure or arbitrariness of the administrator.  Having placed it at home, you risk becoming a never-learned genius who could save humanity, and his note remained unread, the idea not picked up. <br><br><h2>  Search for a solution </h2><br>  Let's look towards distributed information storage networks.  They wrote about them.  Some see the future in them and are already working on creation.  In order for information to become <u>indestructible</u> , it must be dispersed and duplicated in a <u>self-organizing</u> environment. <br><br>  The first condition of the power of ideas is fulfilled on the word "indestructible."  Information will become indestructible and independent of the arbitrariness of individual fragments of the network. <br><br>  The second condition of the power of ideas - their crystallization - will be fulfilled on the word ‚Äúself-organizing‚Äù.  If we get a tool for working with knowledge, we will be able to take into account that Vasya‚Äôs idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdrawing a mustache in a video for Youtube to a bear agrees with Petit‚Äôs idea about the future success of a commercial.  We gain knowledge of the basics of marketing policy.  No idea will disappear (of course, if someone picks it up), we can glue ideas together so as not to get tired of reading duplicates, we can start looking for ideas, knowledge as products of human activity.  Now, physics will not be a dozen thousand different textbooks in different languages, learning in different ways.  It will be a common knowledge with a number of views.  We need to have such a tool and implementation in order to get rid of the specifics of words and start working with the specifics of knowledge. <br><br>  We strive for knowledge in order to gain more control over the world.  "Who owns the information, then owns the world."  We need free and objective information, what our hypothetical knowledge system is intended to strive for.  Who (or what) will give us this system?  No, of course, not everyone needs the whole world, but knowing objective information and having knowledge, we (part of us) will learn, in theory, not to conflict and not let others hinder us. <br><br><h2>  Plans to capture the world (through the distribution of freedom) </h2><br>  The world can be captured by showing the opposite action to capture: constant generosity instead of tying down and hiding information (hello copier ...).  Every seizure of the world was accompanied by a bounty of gifts.  To them, in response, they carried gifts, and the real former invaders bit their elbows and hands, collecting the last crumbs of prey from fleeing slaves.  New invaders then always had levers of what can be controlled and how to pay for work.  And they became new invaders. <br><br>  The formula for the next invaders is unchanged.  Find that in the price.  Find how to free.  Find how to distribute, managing a new resource.  (The third word from the end is the key.) <br><br>  Will there be a bottom of resources when there is nothing to distribute?  Will society receive freedom or will it receive anarchy from a multitude of independent groups, ruled by something unknown, whether with rock (music), or with the cult of an idea, or with a cult of power, periodically capable of destroying any ideas? <br><br>  This is a separate philosophical and historical issue.  We see increasing instability of ideas and destruction of too fluid.  The fall of some values ‚Äã‚Äãand the growth of others. <br><br><h2>  What happens if we release everything in information management?  What does "everything" mean? </h2><br>  1) we will release the <u>information</u> itself - everything that can be obtained - will be received with Optional storage and distribution from just one place (even if it is not one place, but 10 ** 5 servers);  "Who owns the information, he owns the world."  And if the owner of the information dissolves among 10 ** 5 copies of the thesaurus and 10 ** 9 copies of vital knowledge for each person?  Who then will own the world? <br><br>  2) we will free up the methods of <u>presenting</u> information: having 20 capacious disks with a thesaurus of all information, we understand that we can move it very poorly - we learn the laws of physics from school, but physicists from around the world accumulate so many new theories in which only they will understand;  We learn how money and values ‚Äã‚Äãare treated - how the same number of managers who know how to make money will be divorced around, that their experience and knowledge will be valued below the simple work of a janitor and a garbage man.  How to deal with it?  That's right, and further release the information that will be useful, using the <u>view</u> to see it and having an <u>application</u> to use it. <br><br>  3) free up the ways of <u>using</u> information.  The process is already underway.  If earlier the manufacturing of the serial sample took the power of the plant, now the plant with layered printers and other robots provides affordable samples with a price tending to decline.  It is not the product that is valuable, but the knowledge of how to obtain it.  If then it is not necessary to spend life in business to receive goods, but simply the efforts of a mini-factory around the corner to the right, technology will be released. <br><br>  (Yes, yes, material resources - energy, minerals, substances - will begin to be appreciated. And then there will not be enough of them at all ... And this will happen not in 2 million years, but much earlier. But let's not be so pessimistic. There is also the Universe and all aliens are as strong as they are written about ... As long as we have fairly primitive tasks in the queue, voiced at the beginning of the article. Forums, blogs, social networks. In theory, the great ideas that only find, collect, get to work, and the same thing that a bunch of inits does  ovative conquistadors ... well, engineers who are building a new high-tech company.) <br><br><h2>  Where to begin? </h2><br>  Information on the web is.  We can read it.  But there is no way to process information. <br><br>  Let's take a closer look at the forums and compare them with the diaries of Faraday.  What is the difference in terms of information?  Instead of diaries, Faraday could use the forum to write his thoughts and reports on experiments, so that, through careful systematization, he finally emerges into those experiments from which we know him. <br><br>  There are not enough of the above conditions for ensuring reliability (indestructibility), independence (information is generated by the author, but will be destroyed - only general oblivion), work with knowledge (highlighting conclusions, knowledge, elimination of duplicates, unreliability). <br><br>  So, we need some (open source, obviously) system for working with information distribution, adding and processing it.  In its simplest form, these are the same repositories of files and records, but lacking the arbitrariness of destruction by specific owners of data carriers. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion: we need to work more carefully with the information: </h2><br>  1) free it from the chilling mechanisms, it will be everywhere, it will be impossible to close, destroy, ban, despite the fact that, say, the blogger‚Äôs charisma will be the driving force of a given blog and no one will replace it: the blogger will end - the blog ends; <br><br>  2) add and distribute general mechanisms replacing cumbersome engines: since information is freed from the engine as a tool for manipulation, it will appear (it is already there) the need for a new universal (like the same laws of physics) engine (can you not distribute it, but ‚ÄúOkay, wordpress, Bulletin Board, etc. - you will get some money, but no world capture);  the engine is needed as air, and this is for now the main conclusion of the current article; <br><br>  3) and then - to conduct a thorough productive work with the tools of this engine.  Their outlines are guessed in Google Wave - something new and unimaginable, therefore, so far it‚Äôs difficult to work at critical points.  It is then that the Faraday diaries will be replaced by their analogue, which, together with the thoroughness of the mind, will be the tool of the very handful of initiative conquistadors. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113489/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113489/</a></p>
