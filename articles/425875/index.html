    <ol><li>  Laptop with IPS matrix, but it will have a keyboard sag. </li><li>  Laptop with IPS matrix, but it will be very weak </li><li>  Laptop with IPS matrix, but it will be 2 times more expensive </li><li>  Relatively budget option with a good filling, but already TN matrix (and change independently on IPS) </li></ol><br>  I chose the last option, bought a HP 15-cx0026ur laptop, this is a budget equivalent of HP Omen 15, good cooling with two fans, all stuffing under one cover, up to 32 operatives, m.2 SSD (you can install both SATA and PCIe), keyboard for me I really liked the 4th i5 core processor of the 8th generation and a bonus discrete video. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kf/7y/8j/kf7y8j6ar9llsttbyrhbzxjuxje.jpeg"><br><br>  The best assistant for matrix search will be <a href="http://www.panelook.com/">www.panelook.com</a> , I think many are familiar with it. <br><br>  First of all, we open the lid of the laptop, pick it off with a fingernail on the side and a plastic card in a circle, everything is snaps on <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ey/ng/c_/eyngc_pvsm-1cxxuqfrjzoeskry.jpeg"><br><br>  Then we peel off the matrix, it is not bolted with a single bolt, it is fastened with double-sided tape, the tape has bottom tabs for which you can pull the tape along the sides and the matrix will fall off <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xt/wd/-c/xtwd-cz9qdksdtvneivcm1dn95u.jpeg"><br><br>  Now we look at the model of the matrix, I have <b>N156HGA-EA3</b> , I could not find its description on the <b>panelook</b> website, but I found a very similar <b>N156HGA-EAB</b> . <br><br>  Then there is a long process of selection in an advanced matrix filter with similar parameters (slim, 15.6, eDP), threw several in comparison and picked up the most similar IPS - <b>B156HAN02.1</b> , more precisely, I even found 4 similar ones, but in price and quality and availability local stores chose this one. <br><br>  In comparison, I looked at the exact dimensions, consumption, and especially carefully looked at the signal interface, as you can see, and the connector configuration, its location and manufacturer are the same, there were matrices with greater brightness, but they have almost twice the current, I was afraid that the laptop Firstly, it will be discharged much faster, and secondly, it may not be taken out for nutrition, so I took a relatively simple matrix <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wa/mz/ys/wamzysgvgd4pndq2--_yqmb07dw.png"><br><br>  I also paid attention to the section with color characteristics, I did not have to calibrate the colors, everything was displayed correctly at once. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j9/ck/rw/j9ckrwj8dqvfxupbpuva6gntv-i.png"><br><br>  In general, the process of replacing the matrix takes about 10 minutes and is made without a single screwdriver.  You only need to carefully disconnect one connector from the old matrix and connect it to the new <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ub/cf/ca/ubcfca0zblkvz932k-i9suk1mgc.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qv/1v/mr/qv1vmrhra9smu1ttwkolfzzsqje.jpeg"><br><br>  PS: The issue price is 4 thousand rubles for the FullHD IPS Slim matrix. <br><br>  I advise you not to tear off the protective films and not damage the matrix until you plug it in and make sure it fits perfectly. In my case, the store did not mind if I brought back a part that did not start on my laptop. <br><br>  Apply all instructions at your own risk, if I succeed, then maybe I was just lucky ... <br><br>  <b>UPD1: on urgent advice from the comments I want to write that it is desirable to de-energize the laptop by disconnecting the battery, there is a risk of closing the contacts and burning the iron.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/425875/">https://habr.com/ru/post/425875/</a></p>
