Current analytics systems fail in installation volumes.</b> <br>  Losses on the tracker can reach 20-50%.  This is due to the high loads of mobile analytics systems.  Losses are put on the shoulders of the traffic provider, who is offended and starts to cheat in response, but he needs to survive.

      <b>2. CPI is sold by those who do not have traffic:</b> <br>  Mobile traffic is the first two screens of your smartphone. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8bc/94c/e2b/8bc94ce2be384b87df252d6184655d45.jpg"><br>  Facebook, Google, Classmates, MoiMir - 95% of mobile traffic in Russia. <br>  They do not want to take the risks of the CPI model.  If they sell CPI, it‚Äôs very expensive.  Work on the CPC model. <br><br>  <b>3. Frode.</b>  <b>Simply put - deception.</b> <br>  Adding motivated traffic.  More on that later. <br><br>  <b>Types of mobile traffic</b> <br>  Traffic is of two types: unmotivated (advertising) and motivated. <br><br>  <b>Advertising traffic -</b> installations occur due to the usual advertising (banner, video or any other).  That is, people themselves show interest in applications, click on ads and go to the installation. <br><br>  <b>Motivated traffic -</b> users performing an action for a fee (most often monetary).  The application itself is of little interest to them, the main goal is to get a reward.  Such traffic is used only for lifting applications to the TOP. <br><br>  <b>Organic traffic -</b> direct installation. <br><br>  The two main advertising models are CPC (Pay Per Click) and CPI (Pay Per Set). <br>  <b>CPC-model -</b> you can buy only advertising traffic. <br>  <b>CPI-model -</b> you can buy as advertising traffic, and motivated. <br><br>  <b>How do many CPI (partner) networks work?</b> <br><br>  A ‚Äúnewbie‚Äù is entering the market - an optimistic developer who believes in fairy tales.  He orders 1000 advertisements per day for $ 2 at the CPI network. <br><br>  <b>What happens next:</b> <br>  The CPI network takes the order and distributes it to its partners (minus 30% of the commission already at $ 1.4).  Many partners buy motivated traffic of $ 0.4 from their partners, they pay $ 0.2 of remuneration to their performers. <br><br>  As a result: you received 1000 installations of $ 2.  The CPI network earned $ 600, the first-level partner earned $ 1000, the second-level partner earned $ 200, all performers also earned $ 200.  Everyone is happy and happy! <br><br>  The only negative - instead of users, you got a completely different product.  Yes, and the lion's share of your budget spread on the grid. <br><br>  <b>It is important to understand:</b> <br><ol><li>  Many CPI networks do not check the quality of traffic or they put a check on the shoulders of the advertiser = they do not value their customers. </li><li>  Many CPI networks do not check the quality of offers, think that all advertisers will be honest = they do not value their suppliers. </li><li>  CPI network is always in the black. </li></ol><br><br>  Conclusions: if you are unable to distinguish a motivated installation from an advertising one, you should not buy a CPI. <br><br>  <b>How to distinguish advertising traffic from motivated?</b> <br><br>  Advertisers need to track the behavioral indicators of attracted users.  This requires the use of analytics systems, for example, Mixpanel, Adjust or Flurry.  They allow you to calculate: <br><br><ol><li>  ARPU - the average earnings from one user. </li><li>  LT is the time spent by the user in your application. </li><li>  Churn Rate - user churn rate. </li><li>  The user plays or does not play. </li><li>  He passes the registration or not. </li></ol><br>  And other indicators to determine the "live" users. <br><br>  If the majority of users enter the application and spend no more than 30-60 seconds there, then this indicates that motivated traffic has led them there. <br><br>  In addition, advertisers should alarm the high conversion rates from clicks to installations.  For example, in Facebook they rarely exceed 15-20%, in Google AdMob - 1-2%.  Therefore, the conversion in an unknown advertising network at the level of 10-20% should make you think. <br><br>  <b>How do "seasoned" advertisers cheat on CPI networks?</b> <br><br>  The advertiser enters the CPI network and orders 1000 installations per day for $ 2.  But unlike the first situation, the advertiser insures and adjusts the tracker so that only every second or third installation is taken into account. <br><br>  Then he goes to the programmer and asks to make a so-called ‚Äúshaver‚Äù.  As with an electricity meter, every second or third installation is not counted. <br><br>  The CPI network pours 1,000 installations to the advertiser, and he says ‚ÄúI only see half of my statistics, so I‚Äôll pay only for it‚Äù and already receives an install not for $ 2 but for one. <br><br>  <i>This is how to turn off the electricity meter.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d1f/185/277/d1f1852779b60ede3ea82ed27cfa38f5.jpg"><br><br>  <b>CPC model as a solution.</b> <br><br>  Its advantages: <br><ol><li>  Absolute transparency of reporting. </li><li>  How many clicks bought - so many clicks received. </li><li>  No third parties.  Only advertiser and site.  Frode does not make sense. </li><li>  Eliminates motivated attitudes as such. </li><li>  Provides access to 99% of global traffic. </li></ol><br><br>  We will tell you more about the correct purchase of mobile traffic at a <b><a href="http://www.cybermarketing.ru/webmiddle193.html">free webinar</a></b> , which will be held on July 2 (Wednesday) from 12:00 to 13:00 Moscow time. <br>  All questions you can ask at the webinar, we will answer them online. <br>  <a href="http://www.cybermarketing.ru/webmiddle193.html"><b>Register for a webinar</b></a> - it's free. <br><br>  <i>Guys!</i>  <i>Let's not fool each other, because long-term money and contracts are much better!</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d81/c2f/f8b/d81c2ff8be6d16211df5a4e91603a977.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/228043/">https://habr.com/ru/post/228043/</a></p>
