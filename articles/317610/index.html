  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Test task as a means of collecting ideas</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the moment there are several companies of different caliber available that are engaged in mobile and other games.  Everyone needs high-end developers who are well versed in engines, languages, graphics, and related technologies.  And this is not by chance - they just don't take anyone.  If the candidate is a student, then the maximum can be counted on by the tester, and then, with n in 20 degrees of attempt. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4db/6c8/f41/4db6c8f416e84d8b8e7ebd5c957e14c3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Who is interested in the current state of affairs - I ask under the cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Described below is not the truth of last resort, but is based on personal experience and opinion.  So each programmer has a period of improving the work environment, tasks and tackle tasks that are really interesting.

      In fact, all sent letters and requests in 90% of cases are ignored or just get in spam.  You can increase your chances by contacting other contacts available on the official website or those found on the net.  But it also increases the chances of an internal ban and full ignore. <br><br>  So, we have the developer of mobile games NoName.  This name means a specific company, it makes no sense to mention it.  We make a request for a vacancy, we get a response within 1 hour - n days, and for some n it is equal to infinity.  It is interesting that having received the answer almost immediately, the further contact becomes longer.  As a result, we receive a greeting in the form of an HR response and an offer to perform a test task.  If you do everything quickly, it will look like a hack on the knee and will not produce the desired effect.  Therefore, allocating 1-2 hours will not be enough.  We have to spend time completing the task 5+ hours.  But it should be so, that the same should distinguish the candidate of one from the other and show concrete knowledge and skills. <br><br>  As a result, we get a test task with a description of plus or minus complexity from different sources.  The most interesting is that there are no conditions for the graphics to be super, animation and stereo sound with background music.  Everything is pretty primitive - enough circles, sticks and different colors.  You can use OOP, but you can not use it.  The style is not important, and there are no special requirements for the code, as a rule there is also no design for it.  Everything is simple - he took the studio, created a project, threw in a code, assembled it and sent it without unnecessary gestures.  But in fact, it turns out completely different. <br><br>  There were no special requirements and it was decided to use SDL2 so that you could build a different environment from XCode \ OSX.  Time was spent about 8 hours, some of them are video recording, screenshots and search for resources.  Thank you google for the kindly provided resources in the search engine.  The test task leaves irrevocably and demands about a week for consideration.  Even if you attach screenshots, videos and descriptions.  It takes 2 days and the question of the status, it turns out it has not yet delivered to someone who should look.  Ok, 2 days spent in the empty and the result is another 7 days "to look at." <br><br>  The result was not long in coming and after waiting 5 days a request for status was sent.  It turned out that they had already looked, but somehow they did not unsubscribe.  Does not fit.  Those.  being a developer who has spent several hours of his life on a task is completely depreciating, I think that there should be 10 minutes from the reviewer to unsubscribe what is wrong.  Maybe you need to modify or just everything is very bad, but the developer should know about it. <br><br>  This does not mean that NoName is bad.  The conclusion suggests only one - there is a collection of ideas.  Something like: write another friend, everything is ok.  And they are not the only ones, otherwise how not to explain the reason and problems of the candidate.  Maybe he was really good, or somewhere he really did everything very badly.  I think that there should be an answer and more than 2 lines. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Couple of pictures</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/419/5db/e90/4195dbe90ed9481fbab425d82c3c4b69.png" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b82/aad/72c/b82aad72c105441294039d99d7c3b359.png" alt="image"><br></div></div><br>  Below you can see what happened and see the source code on github.
