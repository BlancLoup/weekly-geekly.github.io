Model B121 was originally released as EP121, but in the Russian market it is positioned as a device for business and is oriented to the corporate market - hence the ‚ÄúB‚Äù index familiar from ASUS business notebooks.  In our review, we will learn more about this interesting device and find out how you can use Windows outside the usual computers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Specifications</b> <br>  Operating system: Windows 7 Professional <br>  Display: 12.1 "LED Backlight WXGA (1280x800) <br>  Processor: Intel Dual-Core i5 470um <br>  RAM: DDR3, 1 x SO-DIMM, 4GB <br>  Storage: 64GB SSD <br>  Wireless Interfaces: WLAN 802.11 b/g/n@2.4GHz, Bluetooth V3.0 <br>  Camera: 2 MPixel <br>  Dimensions and weight: 312 x 207.2 x 16.95 mm, 1.16 kg <br>  Interfaces: <br>  Digital pen, 2 USB 2.0 ports, audio jack (headphone / microphone), 1 mini-HDMI port, card reader (MMC, SD / SDHC / SDXC), power supply connector. <br>  Battery: <br>  4.5 hours in normal mode, 2.4 hours in HD video mode <br>  Accessories: <br>  User manual, warranty card, DVD with software, power supply, case (with stand function), wipe cloth, 5 spare pen tips and tweezers for changing them, optional Bluetooth keyboard with two AAA batteries. <br>  Contents of delivery <br>  The box for the tablet is different from similar-sized boxes for netbooks.  The quality here corresponds to the standard of the business series, no ‚Äúeco-friendly‚Äù yellow cardboard.  In addition to directly the tablet, charger and instructions, the buyer receives a cover, screen cleaning cloth and a stylus (with interchangeable tips).

      A few words about the case itself: it looks massive and strong, and its weight, which additionally increases the weight of the tablet, is justified by the reliability and quality of the materials.  Do not worry that after a few months of wearing the case is hopelessly izotrtsya. <br><br><h4>  Design </h4><br><br><img src="http://img220.imageshack.us/img220/4866/86801660.jpg"><br><br>  Externally, Slate is similar to other modern tablets with only a ‚Äúfront‚Äù screen part (changing which to achieve individuality is almost impossible - otherwise it will not be a tablet anymore), the back cover with head will give you internal technical power, to which other tablets still have a long way of consistent evolution. <br><br><img src="http://img528.imageshack.us/img528/600/79704375.jpg"><br><br>  On the back surface are visible slots for ventilation.  The front part has one prominent detail - a semicircular button on the right side.  Functionally, it serves as the Enter button and serves to switch between running applications. <br><br><img src="http://img13.imageshack.us/img13/7035/18034839.jpg"><br><br>  Unusual feature on the tablet - stickers, issuing participation in the product of Microsoft. <br><br><img src="http://img202.imageshack.us/img202/3474/81055948.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://img690.imageshack.us/img690/4351/43950369.jpg"><br><br>  On the tablet there was a compartment for the stylus.  Conveniently, when there is no cover at hand (on which, respectively, there is also a fastening suitable for the stylus). <br><br><img src="http://img690.imageshack.us/img690/1219/97775830.jpg"><br><br>  All buttons on the sides of the tablet - metal.  Looks very stylish.  In order for the tablet to be comfortable to hold, the lower and right side are devoid of connectors and buttons. <br><br><img src="http://img689.imageshack.us/img689/6992/90732748.jpg"><br><br>  On the upper face, the manufacturer has placed on / off buttons, a virtual keyboard call and a lever that locks the screen orientation change. <br><br>  The tablet is big.  Really big.  You can not write it in plus or minus, such dimensions are due to the problems solved on the tablet.  We'll talk more about them, but from the point of view of design, the Slate is a massive and stylish device, suitable mostly to men.  The tablet in the hands attracts attention, but its place is in office centers and stylistically ascetic homes.  Forget about the subway car in which you want to hold the tablet in one hand, reading a book. <br><br><h4>  Those.  opportunities </h4><br>  As is customary in ASUS, the device will delight users with a wealth of connectors and slots. <br>  Two USB 2.0 ports (where you can connect a mouse and keyboard, getting a full-fledged working tool), miniHDMI, a 3.5 mm combo jack (for headphones and a microphone), a connector for connecting a charger. <br><br>  Of course, there is room for SD / SDHC / MMC / SDXC card slots, expanding the storage of the tablet. <br>  ASUS Eee Slate is the world's only tablet running on the Intel Core i5-470UM. <br><br><img src="http://img528.imageshack.us/img528/4849/28176199.png"><br><br><img src="http://img443.imageshack.us/img443/4582/94046711.png"><br><br><img src="http://img846.imageshack.us/img846/9120/53380834.png"><br><br><img src="http://img809.imageshack.us/img809/4976/77448422.png"><br><br><img src="http://img804.imageshack.us/img804/6859/24364543.png"><br><br><img src="http://img197.imageshack.us/img197/2561/15785647.png"><br><br>  The speed of the processor, 4 GB of RAM, the presence of an SSD drive make the tablet the most productive device in its class.  However, there is a weak spot in the system - integrated graphics.  However, the desire to run games on a professional "work" device usually does not arise. <br><br><img src="http://img269.imageshack.us/img269/2419/10750087.png"><br><br>  Why such opportunities?  You can take advantage of the system in many applications.  For example, when surfing the web, working with complex Excel spreadsheets (this is hard to imagine on the ASUS Transformer even if the latter has a keyboard), and in general when using the Microsoft Office suite.  The relationship between performance and programs that require large resources, and determines the degree of professional use of the device.  Even other tablets on Windows 7 are set to "atoms", the performance of which is clearly below average.  Hanging tables are not what you want from a business device.  In this regard, ASUS Slate definitely wins. <br><br><h4>  Screen </h4><br><br><img src="http://img851.imageshack.us/img851/200/46016088.jpg"><br><br>  If you read our review about the ASUS Eee Pad Transformer or saw the device yourself, then you know at what level of quality the screen is in the latest ASUS tablets.  It would be strange if in the most expensive business product of the tablet family would stand a screen that is inferior to the massive "transformer."  This did not happen, so the impression is the most positive. <br><br>  The screen is capacitive touchscreen and supports Wacom technology, which allows you to recognize the pressing force when working with a special stylus.  Wacom is an obvious advantage of ASUS Slate, which translates the device into the category of professional tools for artists, designers, designers, and so on.  Subjectively, it is very convenient to use the stylus, however, only those users who are used to using Wacom tablets can evaluate the effectiveness of the implementation of the technology in the ASUS tablet. <br><br>  Slate is an absolute champion in many respects.  Including, on the screen diagonal - 12.1 inches with a resolution of 1280x800. <br><br>  The screen uses one of the most advanced technologies - AFFS (Advanced Fringe Field Switching), which further improved the IPS matrix.  AFFS has a reduced inter-pixel distance and an improved viewing area.  In addition to the listed advantages, the screen provides excellent color reproduction and high brightness.  As a result, the display does not "blind" in the sun. <br>  The display supports capacitive and resistive input - touching the fingers (and the MultiTouch allows you to use up to 10 fingers simultaneously) can be used along with the stylus. <br><br>  Already accustomed to meet in the ASUS tablet protective tempered glass Corning Gorilla Glass, which allows to avoid scratches even in contact with metal objects.  Such glass is installed in ASUS Transformer and you can evaluate its capabilities on this crash test video. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/EUcJnwyCtes%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhxsz2rQUoBFLwviR76uGL90d5AKQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Software </h4><br><br><img src="http://img72.imageshack.us/img72/2900/31872380.png"><br><br>  The most discussed moment in the history of the formation and development of the ‚Äúmost productive tablets in the world‚Äù has always been the fact of the inevitability of using the Windows 7 operating system. And before the release of the next version of Microsoft OS, which, as far as we can tell, is initially developed for ultra mobile products, discussions and disputes will not subside. <br><br>  So, the tablet has a 64-bit version of Windows 7 Professional.  There are no differences from the desktop version on the tablet.  To enter data on the screen using a virtual keyboard that can be accessed by pulling the edge in the upper left corner of the screen.  The keyboard is easy to scale depending on your needs.  And yet it can be completely removed and go to handwriting.  However, handwritten input is not yet of practical value.  The system poorly recognizes the sloppy handwriting, so you can not count on high-speed writing. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the tablet was in our hands just a few hours.  Getting used to the features of the reaction of Windows to the touch control during this time is difficult.  Honestly, the Android operating system, installed on ASUS Eee Pad Transformer, is far ahead in terms of intuitive reaction.  The main headache that we were able to deal with was the use of Internet Explorer, in which the usual actions (sweeping the page with a finger) led to unexpected consequences (instead of scrolling all the time, it was possible only to isolate a piece of text).  Such unpleasant features associated with Microsoft‚Äôs own vision rather than malicious bugs are found in many places in the system.  Perhaps this is a matter of habit, but all the time we wanted to use free ports and connect at least a mouse.  Fortunately, everything has to do with it in a device that is more likely a laptop without a keyboard than a familiar tablet. <br><br><h4>  Battery life </h4><br>  Let's just say: not bad for a laptop, not enough for a tablet.  Windows 7 and Core i5 clearly use the battery to the full: when using only the browser and wi-fi, you can count on three hours of uninterrupted work, no more.  When you turn on a computer game or HD video, get ready to connect the charger in about two hours. <br><br><h4>  Heat release </h4><br><br><img src="http://img14.imageshack.us/img14/3445/80614268.png"><br><br>  Oh yes, the cracks on the back cover can mislead you: it seems as though hot air is being blown out through them by a powerful roaring stream.  However, in reality, even when fully loaded with resource-intensive applications, the tablet does not heat up in the hands and does not create discomfort. <br>  The noise of the cooling system is audible, but not annoying at all.  It is noticeable only after using completely silent conventional tablets. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  Even before the device fell into our hands, we wanted to make a comparison with the ASUS Eee Pad Transformer.  However, as soon as we got closer acquainted with ASUS Slate, this desire was lost.  ASUS Slate B 121 is not a tablet in the usual sense of the word, and it is much closer to the class of notebooks.  ASUS Slate is more laptop without a keyboard, than the "pumped" tablet. <br><br>  ASUS Slate wins on most laptops with an excellent AFFS matrix, but is inferior in technical specifications, albeit slightly.  Most likely, you will not need more than 4 GB of memory, but I would like a newer processor, of course.  Inferior ASUS and the duration of battery life, but it is superior to competitors in ergonomics - you only have a screen to which, if necessary, you can connect an external keyboard.  Do it via Bluetooth and further increase your mobility. <br><br>  In our opinion, ASUS Slate is effectively used instead of an ultraportable laptop.  And let's not forget that the device is an image one, beating on the external effect is much stronger than a dozen other tablets. <br><br>  Another direction of the use of this tablet is purely professional.  There are tasks that can be effectively solved only under Windows.  And there are areas of specialization in which it is simply physically convenient to work on a productive Windows tablet: working with graphic applications using a pen.  If you're used to Wacom, but want more features, ASUS Slate can be your choice. <br><br>  There may be many niche areas of use;  the consumer has the right to choose in what environments the device should be used, from office tasks to medicine.  We will not list the entire list of directions in detail, but we would like to draw your attention to the following nuance: behind the bundle, high performance + mobility + necessary software is the future. <br><br>  Let's finish our review on a positive note: ASUS Slate is clearly only at the beginning of its development - not all of its features are yet revealed.  This is due to the limitations imposed by Windows 7. That is why the next release of Microsoft - Windows 8 - can make this tablet more attractive not only for artists, designers and architects, but also for ordinary users interested in switching from netbooks to more advanced devices. <br><br>  <b>pros</b> <br>  + Support for various input devices (pen, keyboard, etc.) <br>  + High performance <br>  + High-quality display <br>  <b>Minuses</b> <br>  - Battery life <br>  - Price </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132508/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132508/</a></p>
