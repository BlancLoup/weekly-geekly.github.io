  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review of the free online cinema ivi.ru, sharing with the owners</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On February 26, <a href="http://www.digitalaccess.ru/">Digital Access</a> launched the online cinema <a href="http://ivi.ru/">ivi.ru</a> , which works with copyright holders according to the revenue sharing model (advertising revenue sharing between the portal and the copyright holder).  Now on the portal posted 9 thousand hours of video. <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/video/85650/">News about the launch of the portal in Habr√©</a> <br><br>  The portal has a nice design (although the flash slider on the main page will spoil the impression for those who have flashblock enabled).  Search on AJAX. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Site structure</b> <br>  The portal has a three-level structure: <br>  video format (TV shows, movies, TV programs, Channels) <br>  categories (Funny, Action, Drama, Music, Animation, Glamor, Hobbies) <br>  tags

      <b>Movie watching page</b> <br>  The player is located on a dark background, it seems to me that this is a good solution.  The player itself also makes a good impression - there is a display of high-quality video (HQ), full-screen mode, the ability to insert video on other sites.  Social bookmarking buttons and Twitter posts are missing. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the navigation in the series is not finalized.  Go to the new series in two ways.  Firstly, by clicking on the list to the right of the player, secondly, after the end of the movie in the player (there is no automatic transition to the new series after the end).  In both cases, the series are not in order. <br><br>  <b>Content</b> <br>  The main difference of legal online cinema from the illegal is the lack of new products (and as a result of films made in the cinema with the quality of CamRip).  The shows are exclusively Russian, although for the most part, Lost, Doctor House, Heroes and other successful projects of the western industry of serial building go to online cinemas.  There are some ancient anime series (Onizuka, Helsing, etc.). <br>  In short, now those who use video rental have the opportunity not to go there.  Users of torrent trackers site content will not be surprised. <br><br>  <b>Advertising</b> <br>  So far, banners on the site advertise only movies and programs of the site itself.  Let's hope that this is not an advertising move and six months later the portal will not be hung with flash banners, like a Christmas tree and every 5 minutes the video will not be interrupted by annoying commercials calling to buy a subscription. <br><br>  <b>Sortsy</b> <br>  As a result of viewing the source, the following interesting things were recognized: <br>  Portal developers have neglected the description meta description and the keywords (page keywords), but have attended to the support of IE6.  The site uses visitor analytics liveinternet and Google Analitics. <br><br>  <b>Summary</b> <br>  I think in the near future a lot of sites allowing to download online cinema will add support for downloading movies from ivi.ru <br>  Also, most likely, the craftsmen will make a desktop player (or add it to an existing player, for example in an intv tuner) to watch movies not through a browser, but through a program (if there are ads in commercials that will spur the creators of such programs), as well as plug-ins and modules for various content management systems for quick video insertion into your site.  It would be great if the portal developers themselves were preoccupied with creating a player and modules for a CMS. <br><br>  Registration (and therefore personal account) is absent.  It would be great if she was in her account and had the opportunity to note that she looked.  Also, there is no RSS subscription. <br><br>  Personally, I am pleased with the opportunity to create my own absolutely legal online movie theater with the help of codes to insert films ;-) <br><br>  PS Especially for minusuyuschih- I do not support copywriting, just wrote a review of a startup pointing out the pros and cons in terms of usability and functionality. <br><br>  UPD.  Unfortunately, the site was not ready for the slashdot effect of the news media traffic, since it is now and from time to time it falls into a coma and loads video with impressive brakes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85659/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85659/</a></p>
