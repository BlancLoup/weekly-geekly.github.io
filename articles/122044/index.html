  <section class="page js-page"><h1>One of the users of the Bitcoin system stole 25 thousand "coins" (approximately 300 thousand US dollars)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/bc740e83/fe5a0647/b8ce358a/24a67ba2.jpg"><br><br>  The new Bitcoin payment system attracts many Web users who have already started working with these ‚Äúmonetary‚Äù units.  The system is young, and the problems have already begun - the other day one of the users said that about 25 thousand bitcoins had been stolen from him, that at the current rate - about 500 thousand dollars.  The most interesting thing is that even the creators of the system cannot say whether the money was really stolen or the user ‚Äústole‚Äù them - Bitcoin features are such that it is impossible to verify all this.  Niels Schneider, one of the initiators of the project, argues that the complex cryptography of the system really does not leave an opportunity to verify whether the theft was in reality.  In general, it is strange to hear it somehow, especially from developers. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The victim <a href="http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php%3FPHPSESSID%3D8ee18a7b85f1211a9b99540819c5f5b7%26topic%3D16457.msg214423">claims</a> that he got up in the morning and saw that there was no money in the wallet anymore.  The Bitcoin system is decentralized, and allows the participants of the system to remain anonymous in terms of savings, while making payments only wallets appear.  The robbed user of the system (we will assume that he was robbed of it) said that he kept all the data in encrypted form on his hard drive, and yet these measures did not help him in this case.  In addition, he says that he suspected something amiss in the evening, changed the password, set the PC to check for antivirus.  Some little things were found, but it seems to be not critical (I don‚Äôt know how the victim determined whether the viruses found were critical or not).

      Then he put the system on a full anti-virus check and went to bed.  When he got up - 25 thousand "bitcoins" evaporated from the account.  At the current rate, as mentioned above, this is about half a million US dollars.  However, the developers claim that it is possible to sell 25 thousand Coins for no more than 300 thousand dollars.  At the same time, the user from whom the coin was stolen, did not invest either 300 thousand or 500 thousand, he had previously bought these 25 thousand bitcoins for about $ 1,000 before the rate went up. <br><br>  But the fact remains that there is no money, and it is unlikely the victim will be comforted by the thought that he used to spend only $ 1,000.  Anyway, the actual losses - 300 thousand, no less.  This is much worse than the case with one of the SEO-Russia, which, according to him, was taken about 20 thousand dollars.  As you can see, here the amount is more. <br><br>  In general, somehow it turns out strangely - whether it was a theft, or not, if it was - the creators of the system can do nothing.  One can imagine to what level ‚Äúcrime‚Äù can rise, so to speak, in a payment system where it is impossible to return stolen goods. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/06/16/bitcoin_theft_claims/">theregister</a> <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> .  Thank <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/uzer/" class="user_link">uzer</a> for the link in the comments.  Symantec has <a href="http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/all-your-bitcoins-are-ours">identified a Trojan</a> whose sole purpose is to detect the wallet.dat wallet.dat file of the Bitcoin system and send this file to the attacker's mail.  In addition, the guys from Symantec found the Trojan source codes in some very specific forums.  Software whose sources are found by experts can also send the found wallet.dat file to the attacker's FTP. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/6a1f8c74/d572f67f/52c6259d/2336e831.jpg"><br><br>  Representatives of the company recommend choosing a strong password for working with a wallet, so that brute force cannot help an attacker. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122044/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122044/</a></p>
