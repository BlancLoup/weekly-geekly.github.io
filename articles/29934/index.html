  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Consult for free, and you will be paid for the work</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The issue was discussed by users Roman_Mix (http://habrahabr.ru/blog/i_am_clever/47354.html) and romanser (http://romanser.habrahabr.ru/blog/47343.html). <br>  Romanser acted as a principled altruist, disgraced the service, indirectly substituted a number of users, earned a reputation and did not earn a penny. <br>  Roman_Mix proposed a scheme on the verge of blackmail.  Money would, national glory and shock for the owners - no. <br>  My few kopecks. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Very often there are situations when people badly need your help, and not only the time resources spent are valuable, but the high qualifications and willingness to advise. <br><br>  A simple example: <br>  One local company was heavily substituted by a sysadmin.  He received sn about three times the average for his position, registered a domain for himself, used a personal virtual server, did not give anyone access to the admin area.  At some point after a conflict with the authorities, he collected manatka and went home, saying by phone that he would give the passwords for 2 million rubles. <br>  The company turned to us.  As a result of a rather interesting work, which in total took about 3 hours, we got both the site and hacked the password.  This work was done by us free of charge, mainly because prior to the decision we could not guarantee that everything would work out, and even assess the complexity of the work. <br>  Subsequently, we were paid to write a manual for website management, transferred to us on hosting, ordered promotion, etc.  The relationship is beautiful. <br>  Very often, we just help to write a letter to the domain registration center, set up spam filters, etc.  We never register domains for ourselves, even if the person himself permits it.  What for?  Then, to show that you are an adequate professional, ready to cooperate and, pardon me for the pathos, a noble person. <br>  This nobility or, more precisely, scrupulousness in some matters has a very specific material expression - they begin to trust you.  In 90% of cases, a request to tell a password from google analytics or mail in case of problems is reported without hesitation and without regret. <br>  They trust not only secrets, but also responsible work for serious payment. <br><br>  What is the conclusion?  In many situations, it is possible to earn money by making people really need a good deed, save a person, and not substitute third parties.  And here the key is not an opportunity to earn.

      In the case of BP, it was possible to contact the admins, show their qualifications and offer to show holes for payment.  Minor bug = 100 bucks, a critical hole with the possibility of theft of $ 1500 masterparoles.  A normal technical director would be convinced of the seriousness of the interlocutor and at least considered the situation more closely.  Could you find yourself?  Well, well done.  Would send - well, and God bless them, not the last project, let them regret later.  Out of sympathy for BP visitors, it would be possible to give descriptions, but this is a personal matter. <br><br>  It seems to me that a professional should foresee the consequences of his actions, and calculate them.  The reputation of a competent and careful specialist is often more expensive than the extra 30 pieces of silver. <br><br>  ps By the way, in my opinion it is not a sin to value yourself highly.  Once, an extremely capricious customer company refused to use our hosting and arranged a big bucha, demanding a manual for installing our site on a third-party hosting.  The manual of 10 lines was, there were no special requirements to the server, but deploying the dump was an insoluble problem for the customer administrator. <br>  Brought the whole brain, demanding help.  As a result, we concluded a contract for the installation of the site at a price three times the cost of hosting for a year. <br><br>  pps In our region, we hold a contest <a href="http://it-volgograd.ru/">it-volgograd.ru</a> sites.  It happens, serves sites that do not filter GET.  We in such cases show openness for injections, and of course, for free. <br>  What for?  But then - we are ready to spend 10 minutes to help, counting on respect and a future partnership. <br><br>  The reputation of an honest professional guarantees the relevance of services.  In the presence of the market, of course. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29934/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29934/</a></p>
