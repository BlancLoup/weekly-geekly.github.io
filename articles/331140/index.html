A year ago, on 13.6.2016, we launched our project. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/116/fb3/430/116fb343022c4981972c3b41ebaf700d.png"></div><br>  The first birthday, a year behind, we remember how it was ... <br><br>  What did not happen this year alone, we had to go through a lot: successes, joys, bases, intrigues, disappointments, etc.  etc.  Everything would be fine if we had the experience of creating games.  We could have avoided much on our way.  But we didn‚Äôt have experience, we didn‚Äôt have knowledgeable mentors or advisers either, we all learned about ourselves and also scooped information in various forums where indie developers shared their experience and gave advice.  But, as it turned out in practice, not all, not all tips are universal.

      We decided to recall how it was, and to publish, so to speak, the chronology of the most, in our opinion, significant events, both good and bad. <br><br>  In front of each event, we put down the signs + and -, which means the event was positive or negative. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  <b>How it all began</b> </h3><br>  Our small development team is out of gamers.  We played World of Tanks Generals.  When in April 2016, the WoT Generals team announced that their project would no longer be updated, we realized that we were losing the world in which we wanted to live.  It was necessary to create your own. <br><br>  And we created it! <br><br>  But cloning is not our way.  Pushing off from the idea, the team made its own completely original project.  Of course, it was not without problems and difficulties - and who is it easy? <br><br>  - 04/15/2016 Learn about the suspension of the game WoT Generals. <br><br>  + 13.6.2016 An idea to create your own game, a browser version of CCI in the setting of the Second World War, appears.  We discuss the budget in + - 50 000 rubles.  Of their own in the team - the ideological mastermind, the designer who began work on the interface, two mechanics, a translator to localize the game in English and several people who invested their personal savings.  On freelancing we find a programmer and an artist for images on cards. <br><br>  Getting started!  All are full of positive, we are already starting to take profits, we advise which one is better to buy a car, a house, a yacht, where to go to relax and where to invest profits.  Well, why not, we are developers? <br><br><h3>  <b>The first difficulties and the first joys</b> </h3><br><ul><li>  - 13.7.2016 The first puncture.  We understand that the ordered and paid images on cards in the form of posters do not suit us. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  + 13.7.2016.  We go to the social network.  We created a group of VKontakte and Facebook, as well as a page on Twitter. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  + 15.7.2016.  We make the decision to try our strength on the GreenLight site on Steam.  Create several layouts (screenshots) in Photoshop and collect video presentation. </li></ul><br>  Our first priority was to see if our game was interesting to people.  Many offered us to buy votes and go through GreenLight, we refused.  Moreover, we even acquaintances who decided to support us, asked not to vote.  Our goal was not to go through GreenLight by any means, our goal was to look at the true state of things around our game, we did not want to engage in self-deception. <br><br><ul><li>  + 18.7.2016.  In connection with the campaign for GreenLight, we decide that we will create a game emulator in the client. </li></ul><br><h3>  <b>Beginning of work</b> </h3><br><ul><li>  + 7.7.2016.  We find a programmer who starts writing a client emulator. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  + 7.7.2016.  We inform that in three weeks we are launching the Alpha test. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  + 26.7.2016.  The first independent video review, based on pictures from photoshop and video shows, on our game. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  + 26.7.2016 We are in the top 100 on GreenLight on Steam.  After a few hours they give us the green light, we go through the GreenLight and get the opportunity to sell the game through Steam. </li></ul><br>  Wings interfere with walking, and the halo does not allow to sleep at night.  We begin to realize that we are cool developers.  We agree on a set of holy rules, which consists of just one rule, so to speak, a set of one holy rule, which says that even if the GIANTS of the gaming industry, who issue AAA games, will offer us millions of dollars (and they will offer us them) we believe in this, a matter of time) for the fact that we sell them the rights to our masterpiece - we will not agree, we will not even discuss and bargain! <br><br><h3>  <b>Accomplishments and wrecks</b> </h3><br>  It's amazing how much can happen in one week. <br><br><ul><li>  + 27.7.2016 We have a news site. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  - 29.7.2016 The designer leaves the team. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  + 29.7.2016 We are inventing a know-how in CCI.  "Transition cards."  (Transition cards are not sold for money: they can only be won by the enemy in battle. If a player plays special cards and is defeated, they will go to the enemy.) </li></ul><br><ul><li>  + 1.8.2016 We find on freelance a new designer. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  - 3.8.2016 We understand that the game client emulator will not allow us to integrate the game on Steam. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  + 3.8.2016 We make a decision to abandon the browser version of the game and write a full-fledged client.  The programmer who has written to us the emulator of the client undertakes work. </li></ul><br><h3>  <b>Plans change</b> </h3><br>  We decided to tabulate the events that followed the appearance of the news site. <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Status </th><th>  date </th><th>  Event </th></tr><tr><td>  - </td><td>  5.8.2016 </td><td>  We understand that the game will cost us much more than we <br>  originally planned.

What happened?  And that's what.  The programmer announces to us that the game is not ready.  Later it turned out that he did nothing at all, just fool us and several times a week sent a fictional report on the work done, deceived us for two months.  And we, the naive, believed that his work was in full swing, did not insist on intermediate shows.  We worked without a contract, on trust, so there is nothing to show, the blessing at least returned the prepayment. <br><br>  It is difficult to convey our state, to say that we were disappointed - to say nothing.  It took several days to recover and decide what to do next: put an end to it or start virtually everything from scratch. <br><br>  We made conclusions and 10/23/2016 decided that the first thing to do is to draw up and sign an agreement, only then begin work with the performers, no more option ‚Äúon trust‚Äù. <br><br><h3>  <b>Starting from scratch</b> </h3><br>  In two days we find a new programmer, the price of his work is high, but we decide to get the first working assembly as quickly as possible.  We schedule the work, we approve, and he starts to work.  What's next?  And then - again, work, and again the table. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Status </th><th>  date </th><th>  Event </th></tr><tr><td>  + </td><td>  10.25.2016 </td><td>  Opening a new site / forum. <br><br></td></tr><tr><td>  - </td><td>  10.27.2016 </td><td>  We inform that in connection with the setup of the previous programmer <br>  PTA is canceled. <br><br></td></tr><tr><td>  - </td><td>  11.11.2016 </td><td>  Getting started ‚ÄúDeveloper Diary‚Äù with process reports <br>  create games. <br><br></td></tr><tr><td>  + </td><td>  11.11.2016 </td><td>  We hold a competition for the best "obzyvalka" based on the name <br>  Heroes of Card War. <br><br></td></tr><tr><td>  + </td><td>  11/13/2016 </td><td>  We refuse the full name of the game (stop publishing it) <br>  in favor of "obzyvalki" abbreviations HoCWar, easy to remember and <br>  sounds nice:-) <br><br></td></tr><tr><td>  + </td><td>  11/13/2016 </td><td>  We enter access packages. <br><br></td></tr><tr><td>  - </td><td>  11.11.2016 </td><td>  The team leaves the second mechanic. <br><br></td></tr><tr><td>  + </td><td>  11.11.2016 </td><td>  We find new mechanics, two people, not lovers, <br>  and professionals in the games of the KKI genre.

We start working on this. (Each player can see his own set of cells. The player cannot observe whether a unit is located in a hidden cell or it is empty. Visually, such a cell on the field is represented by a gray cloud. In general, the player sees the cells in which his units and neighboring cells.) <br><br>  + 1.12.2016 We come up with a ‚Äúknow-how‚Äù on the boosters in the game. (Instead of the usual boosters, where after the purchase, players get the number of cards that are in the booster, in our boosters there is a mixture of excitement and luck. We offer the opportunity to choose a certain number of cards. Choose a booster with 5 cards - you can open any 4 cards. 11 cards are available from 15, 23 cards from 35 are available. Each card boasts guaranteed premium cards. Guess the player‚Äôs premium cards or not depends only on luck and magic rituals believe in  many. <br><br>  And here are the next advantages - December 1, 2016 we present our first advertising art, and December 3, 2016 - the first stream on which we present the gameplay of the game.  Our mechanics play several games, talk about the process of creation, share plans. <br><br><h3>  <b>New Year's gifts and not only ...</b> </h3><br>  December turned out to be generous with both a plus and a minus sign: <br><br><ul><li>  - December 4, 2016. The translator leaves the team, he translated the news and localized the game into English.  We ask one of the mechanics to temporarily take on this job. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  December 5, 2016. We decide to upload the working assembly to Steam and set the status to ‚ÄúEarly Access‚Äù, yes, the game is still very raw, but many have long asked for the opportunity to try out the game. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  - 12.12.2016 We understand that one designer does not cope, we ask for help from a familiar, professional designer. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  December 7, 2016. We present the new design of the "Transition" cards. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  + 9.12.2016 We are presenting the design of premium cards </li></ul><br><ul><li>  11.12.2016 We present the design of the trophy cards </li></ul><br><ul><li>  - 12/15/2016 One of the 2 new mechanics leaves the team. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  + 12/19/2016 The working assembly is uploaded to Steam, we are waiting for the approval of the moderators. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  - 12/21/2016 Steam moderators returned the assembly and indicated errors during integration. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  + 12/22/2016 Fixed bugs and sent the assembly again to Steam. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  - 12/22/2016 Steam moderators returned the assembly and indicated errors during integration. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  12/23/2016 Corrected errors and sent the assembly again to Steam. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  - 12/24/2016 Steam moderators returned the assembly and indicated errors during integration. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  12/25/2016 Fixed bugs and sent the assembly again to Steam. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  12/29/2016 The game was moderated and became available on Steam. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  December 12, 2016 The PTA began.

Our actions: <br><br><ul><li>  + 3.4.2017 We make a decision that it is better to order all the necessary texts from a professional copywriter, we go to our native freelance. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  + 5.4.2017 Loading new build into Steam after replacing the graphics. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  + 6.4.2017 We remove the lock on Steam. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  + 9.4.2017 We inform that in a week MBT. </li></ul><br>  And - new difficulties: <br><br><ul><li>  - 23.4.2017 Steam does not translate the game into a free distribution, citing the fact that those who bought the game for real should have an advantage over those who will receive the game for free before transferring to a free distribution.  MBT is delayed. </li></ul><br>  Generally, an interesting story.  We sent a request to Steam and asked to transfer our game to a free distribution, Steam administrators asked us the question "What advantage will players who have purchased the game have for the money?" Frankly speaking, we did not expect such an outcome of the cases and were not ready for it.  From the very first days, we indicated that our game would be Free-to-play and even in the information about early access we clearly stated ‚ÄúAt the time of the MBT and after the release, the game will become Free-to-play, but there will be an in-game store‚Äù and all the players who acquired our game - 100% knew that in the end the game will be distributed free of charge. <br><br>  And finally, on 25.4.2017, we are launching a crowdfunding project on a boomstarter. <br>  Next is our favorite table. <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Status </th><th>  date </th><th>  Event </th></tr><tr><td>  - </td><td>  26.4.2017 </td><td>  The previous designer again submits a complaint to Steam and we repeatedly <br>  block the game. <br><br></td></tr><tr><td>  + </td><td>  27.4.2017 </td><td>  We are threatening the previous designer with a court for defamation, and he <br>  withdraws his claim to Steam. <br><br></td></tr><tr><td>  + </td><td>  28.4.2017 </td><td>  We remove the lock on Steam. <br><br></td></tr><tr><td>  + </td><td>  29.4.2017 </td><td>  We begin active work on the abilities of cards. <br><br></td></tr><tr><td>  + </td><td>  3.5.2017 </td><td>  Steam translates the game into a free distribution.

We publish applications with proposals on a number of sites. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  + 16.5.2017 The first version of our advertising in the form of a cartoon of the 40s. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  + 16.5.2017 We make a press release distribution. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  + 17.5.2017 The first offers from investors begin to arrive. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  + 20.5.2017 Destroying the worst bug of our game. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  + 23.5.2017 We start negotiations with one of the investors. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  - 25.5.2017 According to the results of the press release distribution, we are only published on several portals, disappointment, we expected more, at least comparable to the result of the first distribution. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  + 27.5.2017 We find a common language with the investor, we begin cooperation. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  + 28.5.2017 We receive the first funds from the investor and understand that we have a future. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  + 29.5.2017 We are beginning to work actively, we are thinking about expanding the state. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  + 31.5.2017 Make a decision to participate in the GTP Indie Cup. </li></ul><br><h3>  <b>June.</b>  <b>Summing up</b> </h3><br>  June is not over yet, so there are few events - but all are positive: <br><br><ul><li>  + 6.6.2017 We publish a new site design. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  + 13.6.2017 The first issue of our "newspaper" HoCWar News </li></ul><br>  Summing up, counting the pros and cons: <br><br><ul><li>  85 good points. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  32 Negative moments. </li></ul><br>  As we see, even with such a large number of negative points, there are more positive ones, although it must be admitted that some negative ones by their significance far outweigh the positive ones.  Here we have such a difficult and very diverse year, we hope that all subsequent years will be much more positive and the number of pluses will be much more than the number of minuses.  However, there will always be cons, where without them, as they say, ‚Äúbypassing the next rake, we are losing precious experience.‚Äù <br><br>  We still have a lot of work, many plans, ideas, etc.  In principle, we have everything to implement them: the team, experience, funding, the desire to work, and if no global force majeure happens, then we will succeed - well, at least we want to think so. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> We do not pursue the goals of anyone to specify or insult, that is why we did not mention the names of those who, in our opinion, turned out to be dishonorable and for this reason left our team.  It may seem that we have a problem organization system or project organizers are dishonorable people, because of which some comrades left the project.  But no, everything is exactly the opposite.  All the people who left our project at various stages are mostly dishonest performers, most, but not all. <br><br>  At the time of the start of the project, we, unfortunately, did not have experience in creating games, and we increasingly believed, hoped, etc., did not even sign contracts with anyone, as a result we were substituted, in a word, exceptional comrades came across.  It was probably worth it on the same freelance or on other sites where game developers communicate, to write in detail who and how relates to work, in order to protect others who may turn to them for services, but this is another story. <br><br>  Having passed the hard way, we earned experience that helped us, albeit with difficulty, but to assemble a strong, organized and serious team, each person in whom is a serious and decent performer, we can vouch for each team member, because they are tested by time and , most importantly, in deed.  We hope that we will continue to be a friendly, organized and serious team. <br><br>  Sincerely, the development team. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/371/fcc/0a5/371fcc0a5a3a4a3e88b5c1a7ee3a9827.jpg"></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/331140/">https://habr.com/ru/post/331140/</a></p>
