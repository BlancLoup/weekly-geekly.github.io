And ride in my apartment or office without the risk of crushing your favorite bug. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Many athletes can make a career without departing far from the sofa (attention: next to him, but not on him!).  If one of your friends is not involved in sports, because  hesitates to leave the house - let him stay there, but give him a link to this article.

      My name is Alexey and I have been thinking all my life that I can ride a bike;  but with this delusion I broke up, having got on the bicycle training of Petersburg <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">triathletes</a> .  As it turned out, I fall as soon as I sit on the bike (in truth, I really couldn‚Äôt sit on it).  The fact is that the training was carried out on cycle stations and the ability to keep balance on a bike while driving on a regular road didn‚Äôt help me here - the cyclists, which are discussed, do not tolerate unnecessary movements, such as stupid taxiing, which we usually do at the beginning. <br><br>  I responded to the offer to learn how to ride a bike right away, even though it sounded wild (had I ever done sotochka across the cross-road, especially without straining?).  ‚ÄúGet on the bike‚Äù helped me these guys, triathletes (professional amateurs as I call them now): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/22f/783/337/22f7833371524af6b1c40ef2b4748d27.jpg"><br><br>  From near to far: <br><br><ul><li>  Oleg, director of the construction equipment rental company, repeated finisher of the IRONMAN series competitions; </li><li>  Natalia, female trainer, nutrition consultant, is now preparing and preparing for the IRONMAN distance; </li><li>  Ivan, coach and triathlete, who took 3rd place at the World Championships IRONMAN 2016 held in America on the island of Hawaii.  And the repeated winner and medalist of this series; </li><li>  Alexey (my namesake), an entrepreneur, until (like me) falls off the bike. </li></ul><br>  It all starts without space technology: with a roller bike.  Riding on it looks boring, but try putting a bicycle on it and what you used to know about the ability to concentrate, keep balance and stay calm - now you need to make the most of it.  Actually, for athletes the ability to ‚Äúride a bike‚Äù means the ability to work without difficulty on such a machine, i.e.  You can learn how to ride only in the gym (or, at home, under the bellowing of a remote trainer or the meowing of a local cat).  Roller blades are used by professional cyclists (not to be distracted during the race and not to waste energy on constant steering and maintaining balance) and amateurs to improve their skills: the ability to concentrate and focus. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/854/2d0/d98/8542d0d981334fdb94e5516ce353e70d.jpg"></div>  <i>Rolling machine, photo from the Internet</i> <br><br>  On a roller machine, as in real life: first, gently, holding on to the wall, then more confidently, but occasionally falling.  Therefore, it is recommended to go between the wall and the easy chair, for example.  Once you have learned how to stand on the machine (you need one or two workouts), you can start working closely with the trainer and move on to a more interesting machine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d27/557/9c1/d275579c1f51407b98729950e80dca51.jpg">  <i>Out!</i> <br><br>  The idea is quite simple: we remove the rear wheel from a bicycle, put this machine instead, and pedal.  Something like this you probably saw from friends who bought an exercise bike, which most likely now only collects dust.  In fact, you need to get used to the horse on which you will be jumping at the crucial moment, and the bike station allows you to train on your bike (not only on the highway road, but also on the hybrid and MTB). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a1/fd3/ad6/3a1fd3ad6cf84068b206faf8ff805044.jpg">  <i>The electric motor, which, on the contrary, makes the life of the rider harder</i> <br><br>  Inside the machine - an electric motor (quite legal), which creates the necessary load on the cassette (a set of rear stars of the bicycle) according to a given program.  You can start with simple exercises and diagnosis of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems of the future rider under the supervision of a coach.  But it is much more interesting to <s>play Need For Speed ‚Äã‚Äãto</s> ride on a virtual track.  Take, for example, the French Alps: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/248/c5e/999/248c5e999cfc47f49a9f1e62354e4712.png">  <i>Alps home delivery</i> <br><br>  The bicycle machine connects to a computer, a computer to a projector or a TV (the guys with whom I trained have both, the projector is almost not visible in the photos), and - oops!  we are already going to the mountain or from the mountain.  We have beautiful landscapes in front of us, and the bicycle pedals have to be rotated exactly with the effort that would have to be rotated in real life on this very ascent.  The system allows you to imitate driving along the same route that you, for example, go to after competitions 4 months or ride the nearest serpentine with an attached smartphone to the steering wheel and then pour it into the network - this is how anyone can please their bike brothers who are not lucky with serpentines.  You even have to overtake or pass cars passing by it (figuratively, of course, because the wheel of the bicycle is not connected to the machine).  It would be cool to even connect VR glasses (full immersion) - I hope that this is a matter of the near future, but for now - you are going, looking at the screen and not suffering from the dreary feeling of driving to nowhere or to the wall. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r7mlZlQw6HY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> <i>How tracks are recorded</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/baf/22d/627/baf22d62767847b78671b948b80fb53d.jpg">  <i>Now it is not necessary to look at the wall</i> <br><br>  Of course, there are a number of differences from the real route: first of all, this is the absence of wind, hot sun and other weather conditions (for athletes, when the bill goes on for milliseconds, any whiff of wind, lighting of the track, etc.) is important.  Secondly, it will be necessary to ‚Äúremember‚Äù how to take turns, while already training on the street.  To recreate the atmosphere of racing, you can put a powerful fan on the contrary (there were such conversations in training, only I did not understand if anyone was joking or not) or ask your friend to push you sideways from time to time - anything can happen on a real route.  But thanks to indoor training, the bicycle organism will be completely ready to work in freedom, and as soon as possible, you need to go on a real road and practice there.  With the bicycle machine there are no specific requirements for the track for training - prolonged lifting and maintaining the body in good shape in the winter with ease on it are worked out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/478/81e/8e4/47881e8e4ed943ec9b27f251380500fa.jpg">  <i>Virtual finish</i> <br><br>  Now about the guys who ‚Äútaught‚Äù me to ride a bike.  The team is now preparing for the triathlon <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironman">‚ÄúIronman‚Äù</a> competition - this is a multisport race, when the athlete first swims (3.8 km in open water), then actively pedals (180 km), then runs the marathon distance (42 km) on his own.  The race itself is an international event, and it is not surprising that athletes from all over the world and at different levels take part in it.  Some of them train remotely by connecting a webcam and enjoying collaborative virtual training and chatting with friends.  Remote cycling is another argument for that friend of yours, who, although he does not dare to leave the house, still wants to play sports and communicate with his own kind. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/05e/03f/0d4/05e03f0d4c9e48bd993562747a7f91b0.jpg">  <i>Warm tube homely atmosphere.</i>  <i>In the photo there is a catch for attentive</i> <br><br>  Only professional athletes do not have to participate in triathlon competitions - most of them are amateurs.  The latter do not hesitate to use GoPro on their bike rides and send all the footage to their trainer to get valuable instructions for the next day of training.  The situation is more complicated with the pool: the pool is expensive (you can‚Äôt build it alone), and in a rented (read - public) local trainers may ask you to leave the institution, even if you train with your elder friend - there‚Äôs no space for telebridge and conferences.  But nevertheless, the trainers themselves remove the training material (in common people - ‚Äúvideo courses‚Äù) and instruct their students, and our team learned how to conduct full-fledged on-line training. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/445/081/ae7/445081ae751440b9b17583ee2ab017b1.jpg">  <i>Unusual combination of equipment for triathlon</i> <br><br>  Obviously, cycling trainings should take place on a smooth and dry track in the middle of an eternal summer, but what to do when there is snow around you for 9 months a year and there is not a single long and fairly steep climb, but you need to prepare for Mallorca serpentines? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/439/630/a30/439630a307ee49ae8f717b3bb5b93bbd.jpg"><br><br>  Aleksey sportfactory has already appeared on <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/sportfactory/" class="user_link">Geektimes</a> (number 4 on the first photo) - he can also be asked questions on triathlon. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/400059/">https://habr.com/ru/post/400059/</a></p>
