Moscow </h4><br>  Less than a year ago, I needed a hoster for my project.  By the will of fate, at that time my friend worked at the support center.  Without thinking twice, I settled on a shareholding from the Chemical Center.  The project was small, it worked fine and I calmed down for a while.  After a while, the limit on the number of file accesses began to be exceeded, and I had to switch to a VPS at the same host. <br><br>  Switching to VPS was very difficult.  Back then, I didn‚Äôt know Linux very well, and installing the Apache + Nginx + Memcached bundle was somewhat problematic.  Then it was required to establish statistics Awstats.  Then screw a couple more sites to the existing hosting.  A separate problem was the installation of mail.  It is a lot of domains, boxes it was necessary not on one for the domain.  It was rather difficult to organize all this on the existing base without certain knowledge through the console.  And finally, everything is installed, screwed, everything works. <br><br>  But after a while the server began to fall.  Periodically.  Once a day.  The number of letters with the subject ‚ÄúServer not working‚Äù began to exceed 10 per month, and a friend from the support service was fired four months ago.  Whatever I was trying to do, no matter how I monitored, the feeling is that some kind of cache scored all the memory or gc worked poorly.  The support wrote that every day (with a load of 100-150 unikals per day) the limit in user_beancounters was exceeded.  Sometimes the picture was like this: <br> <code>resource held maxheld barrier limit failcnt <br> kmemsize 4719688 8389126 8388608 8388608 24901153 <br> numtcpsock 12 120 120 120 3628 <br> tcpsndbuf 3416 482996 478932 786432 108970 <br> tcprcvbuf 0 514420 478932 786432 645</code> <br> <br>  After a while, I started getting MySQL errors: <br> <code>Error Number: 1030 <br> Got error -1 from storage engine</code> <br> <br>  The error occurred when performing complex instructions with many JOIN, HAVING and WHERE.  No matter how hard I tried to repeat it in Denver - without success.  But I don‚Äôt think that a sample of ~ 800 lines with LIMIT 0, 4 can kill MySQL so cool.

      After a long optimization of MySQL, nginx and apache became a little better - the errors climbed every other day.  Apache couldn‚Äôt fork new processes due to lack of memory, nginx went into the loop.  Having remembered the words of my friend ‚ÄúAll developing projects eventually leave the center to the west,‚Äù I decided - it's time! <br><br><h4>  Part two.  Erfurt </h4><br>  Many experts on the world of hosting could already guess where I landed, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.  Having once again studied the situation around the world of hosters, he stopped at the very (as it seemed to me then) simple and convenient, and, most importantly, cheap version - KEYWEB.  I just needed - Russian or English support, linux vps, root-SSH, the ability to add ~ 10 sites, the same DB, three times more mailboxes, backups and non-OpenVZ virtualization technology.  By registering, I was offered to pay the bill within 7 days, and provided me with an account to transfer my project to their site. <br><br>  Plesk.  Who has worked with his hands through 22 holes before, he will understand me - this is relief, a feeling of comfort and convenience.  Everything is done through a beautiful interface.  To check the transition of the zone, BIND is installed, it is possible to install nginx with one button, separate the database and mail into domains, different FTP access for each domain, well ... who worked, knows.  Another cloud of features and lotions.  I moved all my sites, changed the DNS, and, going to the technical address, I made sure of the work.  There were, of course, problems with support, as, for example, the answer is not to my question, but is this a trifle? <br><br>  I liked everything, and I went to pay the bill.  Keyweb ªovtsy invoice, which goes to Germany, so instead of the usual BIC, R / S and other things they have BiC, BLZ and other, incomprehensible to the ordinary man in the street, abbreviations.  By my great naivety, I assumed that Sberbank employs professional experts who can transfer money abroad, especially since they have stickers ‚Äútransfer abroad‚Äù, ‚Äútransfer abroad‚Äù hanging everywhere.  But I could not imagine that the whole Sberbank team would look at the bill to me, with a cherish turnip.  I was advised to contact another bank. <br><br>  Since Sberbank is in close proximity to my house, and any other bank (Legion or VTB24) can be reached either in 15 minutes on foot, or in a couple of minutes by car, I decided to choose the latter and ... did not drive!  The first snows had just melted, but in some places there was still ice porridge, water and ice, as if leaving the garage, the car sat on the bottom.  And neither there nor here.  Help arrived.  The car, of course, we pulled out, but the sediment remained.  It was a sign.  In the end, I never paid the bill - the zone went to a German server. <br><br>  And here it is - a terrible moment of awakening from the happiness and joy of Plesk.  <s>6 second ping.</s>  <s>Those.</s>  <s>minimum six-second ping.</s>  <i>The minimum time to open the page was 6 seconds.</i>  It happened that the page opened in 10 seconds.  And it didn‚Äôt suit me damn well.  I decided to wait another day and made sure of this wonderful phenomenon of servers in the city of Erfurt - 6 seconds. <br><br><h4>  Part Three  Moscow </h4><br>  Return bad omen.  Besides in the center.  It was decided to choose something else, since such experiments have gone.  A friend who has left the Center advised a new hosting provider, Logol.  These guys from HC conceived to create the best hosting provider and founded Logol.  Having walked on their site, asking the online consultant, I was hooked by user_beancounters that they offered.  Somewhere they were 2 times, more than in the chemical center, somewhere in 3-4. <br><br>  Practically just before pressing the ‚ÄúOrder!‚Äù Button, something sank somewhere, and I turned my attention to another hoster, Agave.  She has two times more beancounters than Logol‚Äôs, however, it costs a little more.  But there is a tricky one: either Debian and ISPManager Lite (+ 100rub), or CentOS and pens (with their own - for free).  The RAM, however, is 2 times less than that of the Chemical Center, but ... having decided that I should try to the end, I took hosting in Agave. <br>  ISPManager Lite pleased with its simplicity.  Backups were made directly in the air, the installation of the necessary components and mailboxes for individual domains were created by pressing a single button.  Comfort and happiness.  Not as cool as Plesk, but no more. <br><br>  There were, however, both uncomfortable and frankly awful moments in the Personal Account of the Agave.  For example, the domain join was killed: you need to choose a hosting, to which you should attach a domain, select a domain (in the .ru zone - 150rub., In .com - 600rub.), Choose a payment method (Sber, i.Money, webmoney, an account in another bank ), press to form a new order and only then see that the cost of services is 0 rubles. <br><br>  But now my sites just fly.  Fractions of a second - and voila!  I even forgot the linux commands! <br><br><h4>  Conclusion.  Hosters are different </h4><br>   lost all my trust, constant unsubscriptions of support, that I am a fool, constant problems with the server at 150 unique per day, constant reboot of the server, scripts that work everywhere, in HTs give an error MySQL. <br><br>  Foreign countries are not good for everyone either.  The plus is that ours are completely stable ... the watchmen will not come to arrange a mask show, for example, in the city of Erfurt.  But problems with payment and <s>high pings</s> <i>high opening time of the page</i> make it difficult to enjoy. <br><br>  I do not speak specifically about Agave, I also have a small website on Logola, and it works well.  I used to choose Majordomo as the most adequate.  Many sites that I have done are hosted there, because there ‚Äúthere were no gaps at all‚Äù.  After all, I, as a web developer, advise my clients and a hoster as well. <br><br>  This is my story. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92613/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92613/</a></p>
