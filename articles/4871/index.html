His next article, <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/2007_web_predictions.php">2007 Web Predictions</a> , written in collaboration with his colleagues, has been devoted to the coming year and the likely main trends in the development of the Internet industry in it.  Trends are divided into several large groups. <br><br>  <strong>RSS, structured data</strong> <br><br>  <b>RSS</b> , which became a recognized standard already in 2006, will <b>continue its victorious march</b> , will be integrated into Windows Vista and the updated interface of the most popular mail service Yahoo Mail.  In addition, we expect interesting (one can say innovative) solutions, such as the broadcast of advertising in RSS from <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/">Techmeme</a> .

      <b>Structured data</b> : an open standard for microformats supported by Microsoft and Yahoo, its competing counterpart from Google, their opposition and possible confusion - this theme will be one of the central in 2007. <br><br>  <b>Widgets</b> that already show off at every corner will continue to spread.  We should expect the emergence of commercial and multimedia applications implemented with their help. <br><br>  <strong>Corporate Applications</strong> <br><br>  <b>Web offices will continue to develop</b> , against the backdrop of the confrontation between Google and Microsoft against this background, supported by innovations of small startups (Zoho, Zimbra, ThinkFree). <br><br>  The corporate IT sphere will firmly include <b>collaborative and web applications</b> - virtual offices that allow you to organize remote team collaboration.  Corporate blogs will also continue to actively proliferate, although the discussion on this topic will continue due to the difficulty of defining the boundaries between confidential and publicly available information. <br><br>  <strong>Web development</strong> <br><br>  Rich Internet Apps (RIA) will be the main force in 2007.  The Apollo platform from Adobe is of the most interest, but Microsoft‚Äôs Windows Presentation Foundation and alternative solutions are not to be discounted.  For example, the platform OpenLaszlo.  Applications that harmoniously combine desktops and the Web, will win purely browser-based applications, giving much more functionality. <br><br>  On the other hand, Google will undoubtedly continue to promote its <b>internal browser applications</b> , gradually finding a solution to the limitations that AJAX has.  It is possible that applications that actively use vector (VML / SVG) graphics will be distributed. <br><br>  <b>Semantic Internet</b> will become a popular topic in 2007.  Companies like RadarNetworks and Metaweb should contribute to the early implementation of RDF. <br><br>  <b>Amazon‚Äôs Web services</b> , its advanced technologies (such as S3 and EC2), have encouraged other companies to create similar solutions.  It‚Äôs very likely that Google will take care of this, and Microsoft will most likely follow it.  Amazon itself will open more than one new direction. <br><br>  <strong>Search and online advertising</strong> <br><br>  Almost guaranteed, we will witness <b>shake-ups in the online advertising market</b> - AdSense will meet stiff competition from Microsoft's adCentre and Yahoo's new advertising platform. <br><br>  The market will require and will create a <b>new model of online advertising</b> , to replace the questionable modern CPC / PPC. <br><br>  2007 will be the time of the so-called <b>Search 2.0</b> or <b>vertical search</b> .  Technorati, Pluggd, Live Image Search and other specialized search engines of the new wave are still confidently superior to Google and other classic search engines because of their original way of organizing the release of information.  However, the giants will also not sit in bed.  Code Search and Health from Google, as well as <a href="http://www.searchmash.com/">the</a> innovations that are popping up on his <a href="http://www.searchmash.com/">test site,</a> speak of his active work in the same direction. <br><br>  <strong>Microsoft vs.</strong>  <strong>Google</strong> <br><br>  <b>Microsoft Windows Live</b> services will come out of beta, take the place of services on MSN and, thanks to the release of Windows Vista, will set the heat on their competitors. <br><br>  To counter the threat from these services, Google is likely to release some kind of <b>WebOS / GoogleOS</b> , rumors about which have been <b>talked</b> about for a very long time.  Again, it is likely that the OS will be based on Linux. <br><br>  <b>Open Source desktops</b> such as KDE4 and Xgl with Beryl with their 3D effects, along with new builds from Novell and Red Hat, will continue to attract well-deserved attention. <br><br>  <strong>Browsers</strong> <br><br>  <b>The second browser warfare</b> involving Firefox, IE and, to a lesser extent, Opera, Flock, Maxthon and other programs will crash more and will rage for a long time.  It is not known yet how Google will behave: its own, or at least someone else‚Äôs, but controlled, browser would not hurt this company at all, but its investors are unlikely to definitely appreciate such a move. <br><br>  Software makers turn to face WebKit. <br><br>  <strong>Multimedia</strong> <br><br>  <b>Internet TV</b> , thanks to YouTube / Google Video and alternative projects like the Venice Project from the creators of Skype, as well as the massive introduction of IPTV and BitTorrent. <br><br>  For <b>Peer-To-Peer</b> networks, the coming year will be the most successful.  growing traffic, convenient unified web-interface and cooperation with media companies - these are the main directions of their development. <br><br>  <b>Virtual worlds</b> , such as Second Life, will become an important platform for advertisers, marketers, and, on the other hand, an element of future social networks. <br><br>  <b>Virtual money</b> will find even wider scope. <br><br>  Community-based <strong>consumer applications</strong> will continue to look for successful business models to ‚Äúundermine‚Äù traditional business. <br><br>  After the boom of 2006, <b>social networks</b> will take a critical amount of time from their members, becoming, if I may say so, anti-social, interfering with real life.  This may cause a drop in the activity of network users. <br><br>  <strong>International network</strong> <br><br>  <b>OLPC</b> can give a good push to the adoption of thin client computers based on free platforms and the use of web applications. <br><br>  <b>Broadband Internet</b> access will spread further across the globe, hardly keeping up with the needs of services in the spirit of Web 2.0. <br><br>  <strong>Mobility</strong> <br><br>  <b>VoIP</b> will also become as familiar as any other voice communication that will hit the telecommunications industry. <br><br>  <b>Mobile Internet</b> will become an attractive medium for advertisers. <br><br>  <b>Equipment</b> , phones and other mobile clients to access the web, will begin to score points in the eyes of consumers. <br><br>  At the moment, in a survey of readers about what a big trend they consider the most important, progress in Internet TV and video services leads. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4871/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4871/</a></p>
