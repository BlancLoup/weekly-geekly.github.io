  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How I work with Remember The Milk</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Just yesterday, I wrote a <a href="http://ryav.habrahabr.ru/blog/71245/">post</a> about how difficult it is to store information about tasks / events in a network in a convenient form and always be able to control it.  I nevertheless found a solution, and it is quite valuable. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember The Milk</a> + ... </h3><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/ce7/fc7/23b/ce7fc723b6f4844282aaa0b4bbe23833.jpg">  This service is well known to all, but it is still unclear how widely it is used and whether it is used in full by Habr readers.  He does not have Russian documentation, so I want to briefly describe with examples what he can do and what he can still be taught. <br><br>  For a start it is worth understanding why we need it at all?  In its own way, this is a public calendar (or not public - at your discretion), which allows you to work with the ToDo list, various events, and also provides us with reminders with different settings for the time. <br>  Simply put, this is the Notepad + Pen tool with a bunch of features that is stored on the network.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  After registration, we get to the "main page", which looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/934/641/7f3/9346417f3ad00ced371fb74bfccdbc05.png"><br>  In ‚Äúcell 1‚Äù we see our account and service menu.  Let us examine it in more detail: <br><br>  <strong>Overview</strong> - the window to which we are at the moment.  We have a little below the ‚Äúcell 2‚Äù, in which there are three items: <em>today</em> (tasks for today), <em>tomorrow</em> (tasks for tomorrow), <em>overdue</em> (those tasks that have expired and which were not marked as completed). <br>  <strong>Tasks</strong> - the most important point in the project, which actually have to work.  It is a list of tasks and settings to the right of them (more on this later). <br>  <strong>Places</strong> - I don‚Äôt think that this function will be useful to me, but nevertheless, through Google, I found and noted the places of study and at home :) The item will be especially useful for those who use RTM as a group, and not individually. <br>  <strong>Contacts</strong> - something like "friends."  I also do not see the need for individual use. <br>  <strong>Settings</strong> - has a significant number of settings in which it will be pleasant to dig. <br>  <strong>Help</strong> - everything is clear (or not clear: only English). <br><br><h5>  Tasks </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/7f7/419/8c2/7f74198c20b9b25a742e6a424ba12130.png"><br>  On top of us are lists ( <em>Personal</em> , <em>Training,</em> etc.) and the ‚ÄúAll tasks‚Äù item (by the way, lists can be added / deleted / edited in settings). <br>  Below we can directly enter tasks. <br>  On the right we have information on the list.  There are no questions here and everything is very clear. <br><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/b70/86e/509/b7086e509557f1a1ae0c4b95aee4217d.png">  Well, let's try to enter a simple task and select it.  Now we see information about this task: the text of the task itself;  what list it is on;  deadlines;  repeat settings, duration;  tags and places;  are there links;  whether the task was ever postponed;  privacy settings.  If we do not need it, then you can not even edit it.  Otherwise, we only need to click on one of the items and set the desired values. <br>  At the top there is a ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù tab, where we can add any notes on the task, which is also quite convenient. <br><br>  However, if we are <s>too lazy</s> to edit a task every time, or we add a task through mail, twitter, then it would be quite convenient to specify all this data when entering the task itself.  Honestly, this is one of the most pleasant advantages of the service. <br>  As an example, I want to give this task: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/eb6/cbf/854/eb6cbf85470bf946d7784e496f7a5f55.png"><br>  After clicking on the enter, we get the already <a title="Link to the screen" href="">edited task</a> .  Isn't it nice?  Now specifically on the task properties: <br><ul><li>  to specify the <strong>date and time,</strong> we must enter a number (with or without time), or a day of the week (for example, <em>friday</em> ), today (you can just <em>tod</em> ) or tomorrow (you can <em>tom</em> ); </li><li>  to specify a <strong>repetition,</strong> we enter an asterisk (*) and the value itself: <em>month</em> , <em>week</em> , <em>2 day</em> etc.  That is an interval through which the task repeats; </li><li>  a dog is used to indicate a <strong>place</strong> (@); </li><li>  to indicate the <strong>name of the list</strong> or <strong>tag,</strong> use the pound sign (#); </li><li>  To specify the <strong>priority</strong> (from 1st to 3x), an ‚Äúexclamation mark‚Äù (!) is used; </li><li>  to indicate the <strong>duration of the task</strong> , the equal sign (=). </li></ul><br>  All of these features are available in both the regular web version and the <a href="http://m.rememberthemilk.com/">mobile web version</a> .  But if we are far away from the PC and we are not satisfied with the mobile version, then Twitter comes to the rescue. <br><br>  We need to connect RTM and Twitter.  This is done <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/services/twitter/">here</a> , after which we can ‚Äúcommand‚Äù the service via DM-tweets.  There are special commands (not only for Twitter: they are also suitable for mail and other neighboring services), we will now break down the main ones ( <u>! Attention</u> : the corresponding text is entered instead of points): <br><ul><li>  <strong>d rtm .. is</strong> used every time before adding a task; </li><li>  <strong>! c ..</strong> - complete the task; </li><li>  <strong>! p ..</strong> - postpone the task; </li><li>  <strong>@username ..</strong> - sends a message to another RTM user (it was not <strong>possible to</strong> test); </li><li>  <strong>! tod</strong> - task list for today (similarly <strong>! tom</strong> works); </li><li>  <strong>! gd ..</strong> - task list for the date (day of the week); </li><li>  <strong>! gl ..</strong> - the list of tasks in this sheet (similarly it works <strong>! gt</strong> - with this tag;! <strong>go</strong> - in this place). </li></ul><br>  Alerting on Twitter is also pleasing to the eye, so the joint operation of these services is quite convenient. <br><br><h5>  Settings </h5><br>  In the settings, we can edit the lists (as mentioned earlier), manage places, tags, but the most interesting is probably ‚ÄúReminders‚Äù.  At the very bottom, we can add various im-services, twitter, e-mail (in the paid version, it seems, SMS reminder is also available). <br>  On the ‚ÄúInformation‚Äù tab, we need to pick up an e-mail address for sending tasks through soap (from a phone or PC ‚Äî no difference) on the same principle as sending via Twitter was considered. <br><br><h3>  ... + <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar">Google Calendar</a> </h3><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/664/3ea/fe8/6643eafe82f136165e6d67b2322c58f2.gif">  One of the reasons why I synchronize Google Calendar and RTM is an SMS reminder.  Yes, yes, they are free.  They are sent directly 10 minutes before the deadline (again, this is not currently tested, but it works that way).  There is a reminder and by e-mail.  Waking up in the morning you have a list of tasks for the day in the mail (the main thing is to tick). <br>  Link Google Calendar and RTM <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/services/googlecalendar/">here</a> .  Then follow the Google calendar settings and there in the list of calendars select ‚ÄúNotifications‚Äù opposite the ‚ÄúRemember The Milk‚Äù calendar.  Next, add a reminder and select "SMS".  At the very bottom is the same tick that allows you to send a list of tasks to the e-mail every day. <br>  Please do not forget to set up the phone to receive notifications (this should not be a problem). <br><br>  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî <br>  Well, that seems to be all.  If you have questions or additions ‚Üí in the comments. <br><br>  <strong>UPD</strong> : Please for those who minus, unsubscribe what exactly is wrong. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/71321/">https://habr.com/ru/post/71321/</a></p>
