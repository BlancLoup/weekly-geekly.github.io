  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Road to sky</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  You know this feeling of good when you go somewhere, and so warmly, comfortably, light, the music plays good, and thoughts are far away, I don‚Äôt want to stop, go out ... And you are driven, driven through kilometers these tremendous iron things, which boil the energy of thousands of years hydrocarbons delivered from afar, even further than you go, driven by people, hurrying <nobr>somewhere</nobr> or not, past houses, big and not, other cars, fast and not too much, and it seems that with every turn people are more beautiful, the houses are cleaner, and the cars are quieter and more obedient, as if where you  and void should come out, absolutely no malice, no debris, smoke, like you've been there awaits a green alley, where children play, laugh their mischief <nobr>fat-seller</nobr> of ice cream, and shy girl with a stroller dreamy glances on them, then your baby, then spouse, enthusiastically telling <nobr>something</nobr> to a colleague on the phone.  And behind the alley you can see a tall hulk of glass and concrete, where in a spacious office filled with the morning sun, the secretary will smile affably and immediately remind you of the deadlines for the project, and you will inhale the trace of aromatic coffee in the transparent freshness of the familiar atmosphere, grin your forethought and proceed to Last revision, as always leaving mail, lists of news and updates of favorites, social networks, instant messengers and other small things for lunch - nothing will wait, everything will be in time ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  What actually happens - you know, of course, it happens almost every day.  And therefore, you try to choose a place, if not behind the wheel, then at least at the window, at the porthole, at the portal to the world, to see how the multi-colored pictures follow each other, almost uninterruptedly, almost independently of you, pleasant and not too familiar and not , bright and not so, but always in their incessant running they remind that the world will no longer be the same as yesterday, half an hour ago, like a minute, it will never be the same as in the last moment.  Let a little bit, a bit, a little, but different, a millimeter closer to a clean alley and leave across Europe on an electric car, a centimeter closer to a full-fledged, verified project and sincerely friendly secretary, a full meter closer to fresh air and real coffee, and maybe I really want to believe, even closer to her.  To her! <br><br>  And you land in blissful reverie, step on autopilot to your usual place, pour your regular coffee into an old mug, begin your usual work, write <nobr>something</nobr> in the editor, answer <nobr>someone</nobr> in the office, look through the network somewhere ... But inside does not disappear feeling: <nobr>something</nobr> is wrong.  Not like everything around, what I got used to, harnessed, without which it would be empty.  ‚ÄúNot empty, but free!‚Äù, - hints angrily from the inside.  - "What's next?  Yes, you know in great detail what's next, you fool.  How?  But you yourself must understand this, otherwise nothing will come of it.  Myself. "

      And you stupidly look at your good monitor, you want to, and you look at.  And everything seems to be as usual, and the conder is buzzing, and the clavs are knocking, and the mats come from the construction site.  But then the brain finally ends the search with predilection and makes a guess.  On <nobr>someone's</nobr> birthday you saw a printout on the door, among stickers and default photos, you read the phrase, but then you were dragged to a new toast ... <br><br>  To have what you never had, do what you never did. <br><br>  And you look at your code, or at your text, or at your layout, and start to boil.  You start to get angry.  Begin to understand.  You close your eyes, sigh, you open, and you begin to delete.  Carefully select and erase.  Then, just as calmly, you suddenly close windows that have become unnecessary, unnecessary tabs, you refuse fresh lulz in colleagues' monitors.  After a moment of silence, you win the desire to press Undo, another second - and you‚Äôre already googling the details of the very methodology that the boring lecturer in gray hair was talking about.  The one that should be used from the very beginning, which is now as clear as day.  Read about it a little more, and more, and bam!  You catch fire with excitement, that's how everything can be, slim, well, clearly!  And they would go with their gags!  All, you will not stop. <br><br>  Do not stop, if you do not regret yourself, if you sustain the gap pattern, if you conquer ordinariness, if you believe and understand that even the ladder, whose summit is hidden behind the clouds, consists of small steps. <br><br>  And then with each line, with each commit, with each build you will be closer to the dream. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/65178/">https://habr.com/ru/post/65178/</a></p>
