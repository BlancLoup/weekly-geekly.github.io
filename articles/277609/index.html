  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What to replace Cisco? Import Substitution Access Switches</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello colleagues!  Today I would like to talk about such an urgent problem as ‚ÄúImport Substitution‚Äù.  We will try to pick a replacement for access level switches.  In the light of recent events in some organizations, it is no longer possible to buy switches from manufacturers already beloved by us, such as: <b>Cisco, Juniper, HP, Extreme Networks, Brocade, Dell, etc.</b>  Many have a question: <b>‚ÄúAnd what should I change?‚Äù</b> .  Therefore, I decided to look for <b>possible domestic analogues</b> or switches from countries that <b>do not support sanctions</b> . <br><br>  And we will consider access level switches.  ( <a href="http://blog.netskills.ru/p/blog-page.html">The</a> differences between the access, distribution, and core switches <a href="http://blog.netskills.ru/p/blog-page.html">are</a> described <a href="http://blog.netskills.ru/p/blog-page.html">here</a> .)  As a reference, take one of the most common switches from Cisco - WS-C2960S-24TS-L. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/873/800/ee6/873800ee688a4fbf801a94ce72b56743.jpeg"><br>  If you are interested in this topic, welcome under the cat‚Ä¶ <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Key features of the <b>WS-C2960S-24TS-L</b> : <br>  Location: USA, San Jose (California) <br>  Port speed: 1 Gbps <br>  Quantity of Uplink (SFP): 4 pieces <br>  Estimated price: <b>$ 2500</b> <br><br>  In the selection of analogues, we will not go into a comparison of all the functionality, but take only key parameters, such as: <br>  - The switch must be managed <br>  - Second level switch (L2) <br>  - Mounted on 19 inch rack <br>  - VLAN support <br>  - Availability of security features (Port Security, DHCP-snooping, IP source guard, ARP Inspection, etc.) <br>  - Gigabit ports (it's time to switch from Fast Ethernet) <br>  - SFP uplink <br>  - Command line presence (cli) <br>  - The presence of at least some certificates (compliance, FSTEC) 
      <br>

      We will also try to compare prices.  All numbers are freely available on the Internet and may be incorrect.  Prices will be listed at the rate of $ 1 = 80 rubles. <br><br>  <b>To get started, go through the switches from the sky.</b> <br>  <b>1) Huawei</b> .  If you need to replace Cisco, this is the first thing that comes to mind.  It is a giant company that produces almost everything in the field of telecommunications.  Switches, routers, firewalls, servers, storage, wifi access points, equipment for cellular communication, has its own virtualization system ... The list can be continued for a very long time (and of course smartphones).  The company is developing very dynamically.  However, having familiarized myself with their model range, I discovered that they do not have second level gigabit switches.  With gigabit ports, there are only L3 models.  As an analogue, I chose the following model: <b>S2750-28TP-EI-AC</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb3/17a/da4/bb317ada49d345b4806515c6ae0a7cf7.jpg"><br>  Production: China, Shenzhen <br>  Port speed: 100 Mbps <br>  Quantity of Uplink (SFP): 4 pieces <br>  Certificate of Conformity in the field of communication <br>  Estimated price: <b>$ 500</b> <br>  Unfortunately we could not find information about the switching matrix. <br><br>  <b>2) ZTE</b> .  It is also a very large company with a large range of equipment (switches, routers, skhd, wifi, etc.).  I personally did not work with this vendor, but according to information from the Internet, this is practically the same Huawei, only slightly cheaper.  ZTE also lacks L2 switches with gigabit ports.  As an analog I picked up the <b>ZXR10 2928E-AC</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c08/c9e/cfb/c08c9ecfb273458a9c4d2abf40253514.png"><br>  Production: China, Shenzhen <br>  Port speed: 100 Mbps <br>  Quantity of Uplink (SFP): 4 pieces <br>  Estimated price: <b>$ 250-300</b> <br>  Unfortunately we could not find information about the switching matrix. <br><br>  <b>3) D-Link</b> .  This company does not need anyone to submit.  It is almost the standard for Internet providers.  A very large line of switches, you can pick up almost any task.  For some reason, not very good reputation of this equipment was fixed in the minds of most admins.  However, from my own experience I can say that switches of good quality and almost no problems with them.  I think that they have an ideal price-quality ratio.  As an analogue picked up <b>DGS-1210-28</b> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c84/d10/6b8/c84d106b8af2427e99806cd804ac543b.jpg"><br>  Production: Republic of China, Taipei <br>  Port speed: 1 Gbps <br>  Quantity of Uplink (SFP): 4 pieces <br>  Switching matrix: 56 Gbit / s <br>  Estimated price: <b>$ 250-280</b> <br>  Declaration of Conformity in Communications <br><br>  <b>4) Zyxel</b> .  This is the last vendor from the sky, which we consider in this article.  The main activities of the company are ADSL, Ethernet, VoIP, Wi-Fi, WiMAX and other technologies.  He also had experience with this equipment.  There were no global complaints.  As an analogue I consider <b>GS2210-24</b> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/86d/2c4/2db/86d2c42db6e046f09a7a0cab4915f148.jpg"><br>  Production: Republic of China, Hsinchu <br>  Port speed: 1 Gbps <br>  Quantity of Uplink (SFP): 4 pieces <br>  Switching matrix: 56 Gbit / s <br>  Estimated price: <b>$ 380</b> <br>  Declaration of Conformity in Communications <br><br>  <b>Now consider the domestic manufacturer.</b> <br>  <b>5) Zelax</b> - the leading Russian developer and manufacturer of solutions for data networks.  The company manufactures optical compression systems, routers, switches, multiplexers, modems, TDM over IP gateways, converters, protection devices and other communications equipment.  As an analogue, you can consider the ZES-2028GS. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d97/710/800/d97710800abd47e78cd93af55ec95f68.jpg"><br>  Production: Russia <br>  Port speed: 1 Gbps <br>  Quantity of Uplink (SFP): 4 pieces <br>  Switching matrix: 56 Gbit / s <br>  Approximate price: <b>unfortunately, it was not possible to find the price</b> . <br>  Declaration of Conformity in Communications <br><br>  <b>6) Nateks</b> - develops and manufactures a wide range of telecommunications equipment.  The product line includes access network equipment (multiplexers, switches), zonal and local communication networks (SHDSL, SDH, radio-relay systems, wimax), departmental and technological networks, GPON equipment.  I have no experience with switches of this company.  Estimated equivalent - <b>NX-3424GW</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/604/c0e/87a/604c0e87ab024f4a85148fed982f9a20.gif"><br>  Production: Russia <br>  Port speed: 1 Gbps <br>  Quantity of Uplink (SFP): 4 pieces <br>  Switching matrix: 64 Gbps <br>  Estimated price: <b>$ 800-900</b> <br>  Certificate of Conformity in the field of communication <br><br>  <b>7) QTech</b> is a Russian company specializing in the development and production of carrier-grade access equipment based on various technologies: xDSL, MetroEthernet, PON, Wi-Fi;  equipment for providing wireless access to 3G, building digital communication lines based on PDH / SDH technologies, as well as wireless digital lines based on RRL.  Just can not comment on this equipment.  As an analogue, <b>QSW-3300-28T-AC is</b> proposed <b>.</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c94/80e/479/c9480e4795f0438582863ac51da20870.jpg"><br>  Production: Russia <br>  Port speed: 1 Gbps <br>  Quantity of Uplink (SFP): 4 pieces <br>  Switching matrix: 56 Gbit / s <br>  Estimated price: <b>28,000 rubles ($ 350)</b> <br>  Certificate of Conformity in the field of communication <br><br>  <b>8) RKSS</b> - Russian Telecommunications Corporation.  Activities: <br>  Network technologies, including for critical infrastructure; <br>  Information Security; <br>  Integrated automated security systems; <br>  Situational analytical centers (CAC). <br>  I had no experience, but I know that this equipment is actively promoted in the state.  sector, oil and gas industry.  As an analogue - <b>RSOS6450</b> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/510/218/c9e/510218c9e9bf4242a0e3b78da4c2d479.png"><br>  Production: Russia <br>  Port speed: 1 Gbps <br>  Quantity of Uplink (SFP): 2-4 pieces <br>  Switching matrix: No information <br>  Estimated price: <b>No information</b> <br>  Certificate of Conformity in the field of communication <br><br>  <b>9) Rustelech</b> - developer and manufacturer of trusted telecommunications equipment.  I can not say anything about the quality of this equipment.  <b>RTT-A220-24T-4G is</b> proposed as a counterpart <b>.</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/74e/6e0/d18/74e6e0d18a014fb8a44f8fadb7bbd3d4.png"><br>  Production: Russia <br>  Port speed: 1 Gbps <br>  Quantity of Uplink (SFP): 4 pieces <br>  Switching matrix: 56 Gbit / s <br>  Estimated price: <b>From $ 1100</b> <br>  Certificate of Conformity in the field of communication <br>  Certificate FSTEC: Level 3 PD NDV and TU <br><br>  <b>10) Eltex</b> is one of the leading Russian developers and manufacturers of telecommunications equipment.  The main areas of development are GPON equipment, Ethernet switches, VoIP gateways, MSAN, Softswitch &amp; IMS, media centers, thin clients, etc. As an analogue, <b>MES2124MB</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b97&#10;/fc2/23d/b97fc223d6a64b5c9ba0c0af744bdc6a.png"><br>  Production: Russia <br>  Port speed: 1 Gbps <br>  Quantity of Uplink (SFP): 4 pieces <br>  Switching matrix: 56 Gbit / s <br>  Estimated price: <b>26000 rubles ($ 325)</b> <br>  Declaration of Conformity in Communications <br><br>  If you put everything in one table, you get something like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ed5/b55/7e4/ed5b557e44d14fcfab8a9abf225136be.PNG"><br>  This concludes our short review.  To summarize, we can conclude that currently there are a huge number of options on the market that can be considered as an alternative.  This conclusion concerns only access level switches with a rather limited list of key characteristics, which are sufficient for an average statistical task when organizing a network. <br>  It is also worth noting that now Cisco is actively dragging out part of the production of some equipment to Russia.  Whether Cisco switches manufactured in Russia will fall under the import substitution program is not yet clear. <br>  If you think other vendors should be present here, then write in the comments </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/277609/">https://habr.com/ru/post/277609/</a></p>
