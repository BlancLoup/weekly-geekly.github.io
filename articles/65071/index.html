      Immediately there was a question about the domain for the company.  The problem was that the domain yota.ru was busy seo-squatter.  These squatters did not respond to the letters sent to the contact email and even had to ask friends to give the contacts of these guys.  By the way, LJ worked perfectly: a couple of hours after the <a href="http://ymik.livejournal.com/165921.html">post</a> I received a letter with a business question ‚Äúwhat do I need?‚Äù.  The letter was sent to the authorities and began long negotiations to buy a domain.  (no one knew about the company and what it would do then, so, looking ahead, the domain was able to buy relatively cheaply;) <br><br>  Meanwhile, the service was written.  In addition to synchronization, it has already begun to overgrow with fat: mobile fotomes, sociality and other danuli.  There was a real need to call him something.  Negotiations on the domain yota.ru were still going on and they decided to invent a name from scratch.  Generally, it meets the following criteria: <br><br>  1. in the zone .ru should be free domain with the name of the service <br>  2. the name should ‚Äúshoot‚Äù: instantly remembered <br>  3. The name of the service must meet the requirement ‚Äúas it is heard - and it is written‚Äù with a minimum set of transliteration errors when translating from Russian writing to a Latin character <br><br>  Brainstorming has been going on for two weeks.  Constantly offered new names, within the team held their casting.  Attracted and friends.  Were tried and "contact" names (vsvyazi), and "tech" (synchronizate), and anglicisms (sync-me), and even all sorts of start-up generators. <br><br>  Did not like absolutely nothing.  At some point, the sound combination came to me - ‚ÄúYap-Yap!‚Äù. <br>  The phonetically name is very light, it is transcribed in RuNet uniquely (thank you, Yahu and Yandex!), But its mnemonic is built on double repetition of a simple three-syllable syllable.  This name is not remembered, it is driven in like a rusty nail in the head! <br><br>  "-Here it is!"  - I thought.  A small survey of friends on ICQ, Skype, as well as <a href="http://ymik.diary.ru/p43805917.htm">in blogs</a> , and - voila!  - register a domain.  Some time, however, it still took to convince the team members that the name was ‚Äúthe very thing‚Äù for the fun and useful service we planned to make.  Technological demos with a new name inside the company went off with a bang, and the name stuck.  By the way, the Koreans really liked the phrase "YapYap", once they even highlighted this point in the negotiations :) <br><br>  In the meantime, we bought out the yota.ru domain, and we began to make a corporate website.  The idea was voiced to combine all our services - a corporate site, Yota-music and YapYap under the same roof * .yota.ru, and, also, apply a unified design to them. <br><br>  We refused to start with the domain yap-yap.ru, and the design got rid of the funky motifs, became serious, became stricter and more similar to the main site.  It is possible that at this moment, for marketing reasons, it was necessary to abandon the name that has already become familiar to everyone and leave it with the internal name of the project, and launch the service with an impersonal domain like myphone.yota.ru ... But we did not find the strength to part with cheerful good-natured Yap and <a href="http://www.digitlife.ru/communication/htc-max-4g-presentation.shtml">It was presented</a> in November this way :) <br><br>  What we have now in the bottom line: the service is actively developing, more and more people are using it to transfer contacts and upload mobile networks.  And the name ... By the nature of my side activities, I often have to communicate with "serious people" who use a couple of phones to create a mobile mini-office.  And seeing the owner of Max4G or a yotamodem on the street, I‚Äôm not ashamed to come up and ask what they think about the company, about the phone, about services.  Naturally, one of the questions is ‚Äúhow do you perceive YapYap?‚Äù And, it should be noted that people who use the synchronization of contacts very rarely say ‚Äúyes, the name is some kind of stupid!‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/65071/">https://habr.com/ru/post/65071/</a></p>
