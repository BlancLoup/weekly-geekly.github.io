  <section class="page js-page"><h1>10 New Year Startups</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc0/bca/217/dc0bca217fba4d56b38fc769ef6b0881.jpg"><br><br>  Preparing for the main holiday of the year is, on the one hand, pleasant and joyful, on the other - vain and nervous.  For work, I had to shovel half of the runet, in search of original ideas and performers for the holiday.  As a result, it turned out to make a selection of Russian startups that will take at least some of the New Year preoccupations on themselves, raise their spirits and help entertain guests on a holiday. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Presents</b> <br><br>  1. You can not think of what to give to the boss, partner or aunt from Syktyvkar?  Service " <a href="http://ideipodarkov.net/">Gift Ideas</a> " will offer several options according to the specified parameters.  You can choose the reason, the addressee, the nature of the gift, the price range and location.  The service offers several options to choose from, as well as a link to the site of an online or offline store where you can buy a present. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      2. If you are a PR person or simply answer for work to clients and partners at work, then <a href="http://sesamegifts.com/">Sesame</a> will help you.  Here you can create a gift set, brand it and send it to the addressee.  You can use the service and for the design of personal gifts. <br><br>  3. Want a very, very unusual gift?  How about a bouquet of tangerines with fir branches, nuts and cones?  The start-up project ‚Äú <a href="http://vk.com/o_horosho">Very Good</a> ‚Äù makes unique bouquets of vegetables and fruits, there are branches in large cities of Russia.  Take a look at their instagram, it's interesting there! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4eb/1dc/b61/4eb1dcb6125a4ad880e6ddd553e1a215.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Entertainment for guests</b> <br><br>  4. Where to get artists for the holiday, when there are a couple of weeks left before the New Year?  Look for the <a href="http://www.poptop.fm/">Poptop</a> platform.  Resource helps you quickly and easily order entertainment industry professionals (DJs, cover bands, magicians, catering, photographers). <br><br>  5. There is no budget for artists, but do you need to entertain colleagues at a corporate party or a big company in a club that was shot in the evening?  The living wall from the <a href="http://hashboard.ru/">Hashboard</a> project will be an assistant in competitions and a platform for the creative expression of guests.  The project collects content with a certain hashtag in social networks and transmits them to the screen in the hall.  Set a tag and topic for posts, establish prizes for the most active and creative, and watch the guests have fun and send greetings to each other.  In the morning you can see all the posts in one place. <br><br>  6. You can also take guests at the holiday by recording a collective video greeting: for yourself, friends who are not around, partners or relatives.  The <a href="http://tabrier.com/ru/">Tabrier</a> resource will help in organizing the process - an event is created in the application, participants write congratulations, and the application sticks together videos, applies filters and music, and can even send it to the addressee on the desired day. <br><br>  <b>Postcards, snow and some heat.</b> <br><br>  7. Care and warmth - are rooted in trifles.  It became quite possible to send coffee as a gift to a dear person, even if he lives ‚Äúat a distance of distant lands‚Äù.  The ‚Äú <a href="http://fresend.ru/">Coffee as a gift</a> ‚Äù startup works with many coffee shops in Russian cities.  Find a suitable option and make each other enjoyable. <br><br>  8. Create a real postcard from a photo from a mobile and send it by mail to anywhere in the world <a href="http://eventcard.ru/">using the Eventcard</a> service.  Follow 3 simple steps and write good words.  It's simple. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f85/090/6f3/f850906f37104ab38788165c2875cf24.JPG"><br><br>  9. Surprisingly, the start-up team even took care of the snow around our houses.  With the help of the project <a href="http://plowzandmowz.com/">Plowz</a> you can find the snow plow machine closest to the house and order snow cleaning near your entrance or entrance.  Problem - the service is available only in America. <br><br>  10. The last service in the collection is difficult to call a startup.  He recently celebrated a decade.  But it is impossible to pass by him on New Year's Eve, especially if your grass turns green outside the window in December.  The site <a href="http://snowdays.me/">SnowDays.me</a> has been broadcasting online snowfall for many years and no one has yet managed to find the same snowflakes in it.  Fascinating spectacle. <br><br>  Do you know start-up projects whose services will be useful for the New Year? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297316/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297316/</a></p>
