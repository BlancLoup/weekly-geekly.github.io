  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What are the information management tools</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Effective business management in a modern global, open economy without active information consumption is impossible.  Information has become so much that it is impossible to do without some special devices, programs, algorithms and methods for its collection, processing, analysis, storage and distribution.  Such tools, the task of which is to achieve a beneficial effect in the ‚Äúimpact‚Äù on information necessary for management, we combine into a separate group ‚Äúinformation management tools‚Äù (hereinafter - <i>tools</i> ). <br><br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/24662/">After we have figured out</a> what they are - the <i>tools</i> - of what they are and why they are needed, let us turn to the question of their classification.  It allows not only to better understand what information management tools are, but also to compare them by necessity, based on distinctive features. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a5/d74/1f9/9a5d741f90e24c2da156a1d5037161da.png">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  How many problems we solve? </h1><br>  <i>The tool</i> can simply be estimated from the point of view of those objective functions that it implements.  Some <i>tools</i> allow to solve quite narrow specialized tasks, while others are suitable for solving a wide range of tasks from different subject areas on the basis of some common (typical) approach. <br><br>  <b>By functional scope, information management tools can be divided into:</b> <br><ol><li>  <u>specialized</u> - effective for solving specific complex and time-consuming, but algorithmically well-formulated tasks; </li><li>  <u>universal</u> - effective for solving problems of a general type without specialized algorithms and rules, but with a set of some common techniques, adaptations, hints, rules that are used in the combination chosen by the user; </li><li>  <u>complex</u> - effective for solving interrelated tasks of different levels of complexity and detail, but united by one semantic, resource or procedural base. </li></ol><br>  It is not by chance that the word ‚Äúeffective‚Äù is used in the definition of each group, and not, say, ‚Äúintended‚Äù or ‚Äúdeveloped.‚Äù  The user has the right to use any <i>tool</i> for various purposes, but the effect he receives will be appropriate.  It is difficult to expect from the use of a universal instrument of significant effect where complex is necessary.  So, the use of a spreadsheet editor for bookkeeping would be completely unproductive. <br>  Most often the <i>tool</i> can be clearly attributed to one of these groups.  The predominant criterion is the number of tasks realized with its help. <br><br><h1>  What operations do we perform? </h1><br>  Information management tools (especially those that are implemented using software products), regardless of the number of tasks, always at the same time offer several possibilities for performing various operations with information.  Since it is <i>informational tools</i> that are considered, this is an important classification characteristic. <br>  Having made an extended list of operations in which information plays the main role at the entrance and / or at the output, it becomes clear that a number of <i>tools</i> allow you to perform only limited their composition, and other <i>tools</i> make it possible to operate informational flows quite widely and fully. <br><br>  <b>A sequential list of information operations that the tool can implement is as follows:</b> <br><ul><li>  <u>selection of sources of information</u> - the definition and criterion selection of one-time and regular sources of information (data, information); </li><li>  <u>information gathering</u> - organizing and obtaining information from selected sources with simultaneous input filtering; </li><li>  <u>processing of primary information</u> - obtaining secondary (calculated, aggregated, compressed) information; </li><li>  <u>processing of secondary information</u> - obtaining user-friendly information based on the results of primary and secondary processing; </li><li>  <u>structuring and classification of information</u> - a special way of processing information of different levels for its ordering, indexing, etc .; </li><li>  <u>quality control of information</u> - control, selection and transformation of information, taking into account the assessment of its quality level; </li><li>  <u>the formation of analytical information</u> - obtaining expert level information on the basis of special methods of its processing with the formulation of conclusions and hypotheses; </li><li>  <u>selection of the information presented</u> - selection of information in the complex for its distribution among the target audience; </li><li>  <u>visualization (representation) information</u> - giving information of a special kind, which is convenient, understandable and effective for the target audience; </li><li>  <u>information dissemination</u> - the organization and implementation of information transfer to the target audience, including transferring information to an acceptable carrier and communicating information to the consumer. </li></ul><br>  Based on the capabilities of the <i>tool</i> to successfully support the execution of certain operations, it can be attributed to one of the following types. <br><br>  <b>According to the preferential implementation of operations on working with information, information management tools are divided into groups:</b> <br><ul><li>  <u>private tools</u> - allow you to perform separate (or separately) operations for working with information; </li><li>  <u>procedural tools</u> - allow you to perform and maintain a consistent (or fragmented) set of individual operations within the framework of solving a single task; </li><li>  <u>complete tools</u> - allow you to organize, implement and maintain a full cycle of operations within the framework of solving a specific task </li></ul><br>  This classification correlates with functionally targeted division into groups from the previous section.  But if, in this case, the main characteristic is ‚Äúthe number of specific tasks to be solved‚Äù, then in the latter case, the main one is the characteristic ‚Äúthe quantity and quality of information operations that are available to solve each individual task‚Äù. <br>  For example, the spreadsheet editor is a <b>universal</b> solution - by functional-target classification and a <b>private</b> tool - by operational classification. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Note on the spreadsheet editor</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  In the examples given in this publication, it should be assumed that the <i>tools in</i> question <i>are</i> evaluated in terms of their direct, unfinished functionality.  A well-known spreadsheet editor can be easily transformed from a universal tool into a specialized tool through programming.  But each <i>tool</i> has its limits and, at times, a programmable spreadsheet editor does not even help out macros, functions, and entire classes to solve specific problems. <br></div></div><br><h1>  What information do we work with? </h1><br>  If universal <i>tools</i> , most often, allow to work with any information, then specialized and complex ones are usually developed to work with information from a specific subject area.  Obviously, the more universal the <i>tool</i> , the more subject areas and tasks it covers and the more in-depth it allows you to work with them.  But sometimes only universal <i>tools</i> allow you to combine tasks from seemingly previously uncompatible subject areas. <br>  Since <i>management</i> tools are considered, the target subject areas most often are: accounting and reporting, economic and market analytics, logistics, marketing and consumer behavior, commodity circulation, project management, personnel management and corporate interaction, financial flows, resources and the like. <br><br>  <b>By the scope of the subject areas that the tool allows to solve, it can be assigned to one of the following groups:</b> <br><ul><li>  <u>target tools</u> - designed to solve a specific task from a specific subject area; </li><li>  <u>typical tools</u> - designed to solve several specific related tasks from a particular subject area or one relatively typical task from several subject areas; </li><li>  <u>system tools</u> - designed to solve different types of tasks from one or more subject areas. </li></ul><br><br><h1>  What is included? </h1><br>  Let's not forget that the view on the information management tool is somewhat broader than on a simple program or a control automation system.  A simplified <i>tool</i> can be thought of as a certain method embodied in a program, adapted for practical use. <br>  An automated system (application) is an immediate implementation of the method, but not the method itself.  And if the management forgets about it and shifts the emphasis in the choice of <i>tools</i> only in the direction of the ‚Äúcode‚Äù, then the problems will not take long to wait. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A little explanation</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Let's compare: the automated system ‚Äúaccounting program‚Äù and the information management tool ‚Äúaccounting‚Äù. <br>  In the first case - a specific application. <br>  In the second case, in addition to the program, it is obvious that there is a formal accounting methodology. <br>  It will look very strange if you try to apply an ‚Äúaccounting program‚Äù in business without the knowledge and application of the ‚Äúaccounting‚Äù method. <br>  But there are <i>tools</i> that have less obvious and legally unresolved methodologies.  For example, CRM.  So why does business allow itself to purchase such software for automation of management without an active understanding and application of the methods incorporated in them (standards, regulations, technologies, templates, methodologies, algorithms). <br></div></div><br>  <b>In the information management tool, we will enlarged three components:</b> <br><ul><li>  <u>methodology</u> - a theoretical basis for influencing information (its changes or measurements), embedded in the instrument and coming from a number of basic assumptions (hypotheses) about the achievement of the desired useful effect for the purposes of managing the organizational structure; </li><li>  <u>program</u> - an algorithm for influencing information implemented in a user-friendly format (via the UI - user interface) or in automated processes (via the API - application programming interface) based on the results of the routine implementation of which the desired useful effect is achieved; </li><li>  <u>practice</u> is the practical part of using a tool to influence information, which forms the best way to use it separately or in conjunction with other informational or other tools to achieve the desired beneficial effect. </li></ul><br><br>  The technique is the knowledge necessary for the proper application of the <i>tool</i> .  A program is the ability to effectively obtain consistently and controllably desired results.  And practice is the best experience of using a <i>tool</i> and embedding it in business processes (including some training issues). <br>  Talking about a full-fledged quality <i>tool</i> , in the absence of one of the indicated components of it can be quite arbitrary.  But if the <i>instrument is</i> valid (that is, it is applied with the result in practice), then to some extent all the components in it are - the question remains to what extent they are formalized and understood by the business (performers, managers). <br><br>  <b>Based on how clearly one or another of its components are present in the instrument, we make the following classification:</b> <br><ul><li>  <u>tool theory</u> is a tool in which only the method is present, but it is not implemented in the program and in practice (a peculiar theory about the possibilities of influencing information); </li><li> <u>application practice</u> is a tool in which there is only an understanding of a certain practical impact on information for which there is no theoretical assessment and, moreover, there is no implementation in the form of a corresponding program (successful application practice is a good starting point for developing a tool); </li><li>  <u>a simple program</u> is a tool in which some poorly formulated methodology is implemented in the program format, which has not been properly confirmed in practice; </li><li>  <u>an unprepared tool</u> is a tool in which a formalized method is implemented as a program, but without an understanding of the essence and method of its effective application in practice; </li><li>  <u>non-program tool</u> is a tool in which the formalized methodology is confirmed and understood in practical application, but for which a program has not been developed that allows it to be used a lot and effectively; </li><li>  <u>a simple action tool</u> is a tool in which a program with a certain practical application is implemented, but for which a method is not clear and obvious (theoretical basis); </li><li>  <u>A quality tool</u> is a tool in which there is a well-developed method, a convenient program has been developed and the practice of its application has been determined. </li></ul><br><br><h1>  And what is the conclusion? </h1><br>  The classifications of information management tools discussed above in this publication can be supplemented with several more - minor ones: <br>  - <b>classification of tools according to information carriers</b> (information flows, analog carriers, documents, etc.), <br>  - <b>classification by type of processed information</b> (digital data, audio, text, video streams, etc.), <br>  - <b>classification by applied technical and information technology tools</b> (distributed network, cloud technologies, use of encryption, digital information structuring, types of data indexing, etc.), <br>  - <b>classification by volume of processed information</b> (file data files, average data streams, big data, etc.), <br>  - <b>classification according to the complexity of implemented software algorithms</b> (simple algorithms that can be verified by recalculation, branched algorithms, complex multi-parameter algorithms, adaptive algorithms, etc.). <br><br>  The list can be continued by expanding the zone of attention and delving into the details.  However, the main classifications (which are discussed in detail) make it possible to understand what should be paid attention first of all when comparing some <i>tools</i> with others. <br><br>  A comprehensive comparative assessment of information management tools can be carried out using this special matrix: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d16/9c3/d08/d169c3d083734331a0bd0880fe0545b9.png"><br><br>  On the working field of the matrix, you can specify the position of specific tools (two or more), which will allow you to understand to which class of tools each of the bottom applies and how they relate to each other. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">It is convenient to specify the position of the instruments using the symbols</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b5/5f7/73d/9b55f773dfb64c40b029d832867c31b0.png"><br></div></div><br>  Here is an example of a comparative evaluation of several instruments on a similar matrix: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/06f/8bd/21f/06f8bd21f7994ecda06d3759ccd726f2.png"><br><br>  It is clearly seen that the tool "G" allows you to solve problems in a larger number of subject areas than tool "B".  A tool "A" having the best "operational" qualities is slightly inferior to the tool "G", but at the same time has a weak practice of application. <br>  Next to the designation of the instrument, you can put down the cost of its acquisition and ownership.  In a sense, this will help in making an adequate price decision on choosing a tool. <br>  The final choice for the business - what tool to take "into service" and how much to pay for it. <br>  But understanding the essence is easier to consciously choose the right <i>tool</i> that is suitable for a particular business and allows you to solve really important problems of organizational management based on the use of relevant information. <br><br>  <i>Information management tool are different and allow you to solve various tasks.</i>  <i>The right choice of a tool for a specific task is one of the important competencies of any professional who in the management system can form a equally important competitive advantage for the business as a whole.</i>  <i>And the right choice of a tool for solving an actual problem depends on the ability to evaluate its key characteristics, advantages and disadvantages, features and limitations in its application.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299516/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299516/</a></p>
