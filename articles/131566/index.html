The task of understanding the requirements for education is complicated by political, economic, social, historical aspects. <br><br>  It is undeniable that the proposed model of social development has the most significant effect on the requirements imposed on educational standards in society.  But it‚Äôs also true that society is heterogeneous and people with different levels of education are needed for the harmonious development of society.  A society consisting of some academicians, as well as a society consisting of unskilled laborers, has no future in the modern rapidly developing world. <br><br>  A well-thought-out, flexible education program, as a matter of fact, should solve the tasks of providing society with people with all the necessary categories of education.  Along the way, a properly constructed education system can also solve the problem of so-called social elevators, allowing gifted people to rise to the very top of society.

      In the modern world, it is customary to divide education into several parts: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ School education <br>  ‚Ä¢ Higher education <br>  ‚Ä¢ (Conventionally) Post-higher education <br><br>  Without pedagogical education, it is difficult for me to judge the tasks of higher and post-high school, although, based on the logic and experience of past life, one can point out the most important task of higher education.  No matter how trite it may sound, the task of higher education is to teach a person to learn.  That is, to find and systematize the information necessary to solve emerging problems. <br><br>  Then, it can be assumed that the task of the post-high school will teach the individual to teach others.  Although all this is controversial and very conditional. <br><br>  The only thing that can be said for sure is that the basis of all education is school education, and choosing the right school education strategy influences all subsequent stages of education and human life.  It is also impossible to forget that the period of receiving school education coincides with the period of physical and moral development of a person.  Consequently, it is possible to single out several theses concerning school education in modern society.  School education should: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Be publicly available. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Giving basic knowledge in core subjects <br>  ‚Ä¢ Instill public values <br>  ‚Ä¢ Develop physical fitness <br>  ‚Ä¢ Help choose a specialty <br><br><h4>  School education <br></h4>  As was shown above, school education, which is basic, has a great influence on the entire system of education and the development of a person.  For the correct solution of the tasks facing the school, it is necessary to correctly identify these tasks. <br><br>  We divide the tasks of school education into several stages.  In simplified form, it might look like this: <br><br>  1. To teach a child basic knowledge: <br>  ‚Ä¢ To read <br>  ‚Ä¢ Write <br>  ‚Ä¢ Think <br>  ‚Ä¢ Develop logical thinking <br>  And so on. <br><br>  2. Show the child the widest possible range of existing sciences and help you choose your future specialization. <br><br>  3. To give the opportunity to get the maximum possible set of knowledge necessary for continuing education in the chosen specialization, while giving basic education in other areas. <br><br>  Based on the foregoing, an educational school can and should also be divided into three stages: <br><br>  1. Primary school, three or four first grades.  Solves the problem of learning basic knowledge. <br>  2. High school, three or four classes.  Solves the problem of acquaintance with existing sciences. <br>  3. High school, four or five grades.  Solves the problem of completing basic education and student specialization. <br><br>  An additional advantage will be given by the spatial separation of schools, which will allow to dissolve pupils of different ages and eliminate their interactions.  Which, in turn, will exclude the possibility of various manifestations characteristic of high school, for pupils of elementary grades. <br><br>  There are some exceptions, for example, learning a foreign language is better to start in the early stages of education, so it is possible, if desired, to introduce foreign language teaching in elementary school. <br>  It is also necessary to take into account the individual abilities of students.  There are many examples where students are forced to study subjects that they will never be used in the future, to the detriment of those subjects that could help them in obtaining further education and self-realization.  In addition, the need to understand subjects at a deeper level than the individual abilities of the student allow, leads to unnecessary psychological trauma and obtaining low marks for knowledge, although this knowledge is not necessary.  The most acute problems are manifested in high school, when specialization has already been chosen and the necessary subjects are being studied.  Consequently, in high school, an individual approach to the choice of the level of knowledge in subjects is required, up to the possibility of obtaining additional knowledge in higher education that is accessible to all. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  Sees necessary: <br>  1. To divide, including physically, that is, to spread the building, school education into three stages: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Junior school (conditionally the first - the third class) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Secondary school (conditionally fourth - seventh grades) <br>  ‚Ä¢ High School (conventionally eighth - eleventh, and possibly twelfth grade) <br><br>  2. At the high school stage, introduce an individual approach to the level of the studied subjects, providing an opportunity to choose the level of complexity of the subjects, based on the results shown. <br><br>  3. Conduct periodic monitoring of acquired knowledge, that is, to conduct testing in the studied subjects every six months, starting from secondary school.  The results of all tests should have an impact on the final assessment of school education.  It is possible to exclude the results of secondary school from the final assessment of education. <br><br>  4. Provide state funding for additional education in universities for students of secondary and high schools, to ensure the general availability of additional subjects for students of different income levels. <br><br>  All of the above are basic steps, it will be necessary to revise the programs for pupils at various stages of school education, based on the tasks at each of the stages. <br><br>  The proposed approach will most fully realize the opportunities inherent in each of the students, which, in turn, will allow each learner to get everything they need to find their place in society and complete self-realization. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131566/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131566/</a></p>
