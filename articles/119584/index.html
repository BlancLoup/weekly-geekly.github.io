One of these successfully funded ideas was the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/danprovost/glif-iphone-4-tripod-mount-and-stand">Glif</a> project, an accessory that allows you to mount your iPhone on standard tripods and more. <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/de/79/de7986198606daea08c3a60deaf0c7b1.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The story of his success is a separate song, but not about that.  In short, I knew about the project in the fall of 2010.  Good idea, what else to say?  The news ran through thematic blogs and I forgot about the project until April 13 of this year.  It just so happened that it was on that day that I became the owner of Glif.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In fact, I became the actual owner of Glif almost a month later, but first things first.  The day was quite ordinary, the real spring was somehow late and I drank coffee while looking at the dull picture outside the window.  Suddenly, as they say, for some reason I remembered this accessory, and after 5 minutes I clicked on the Check out with PayPal button on <a href="http://www.theglif.com/">the project website</a> . <br><br>  The price of the accessory is $ 20 + $ 10 delivery from the USA to Moscow.  882 rubles were written off from my account, and a day later a letter came from the developers.  They were pleased to announce that they carried and sent my purchase through USPS First-Class Mail International.  The date of the expected arrival, by the way, was also indicated - around April 22-28.  The letter also contained a link for tracking the package.  The next day, she left the United States, and other information never appeared there. <br><br>  The parcel was a couple of weeks late from the promised date, but for the Russian Post the result is very good.  The packaging found in the envelope is made in a minimalist style - a simple but cute carton with an inserted accessory.  There are no instructions or anything else in the package, well, there are no instructions on how to use it in the design on the cardboard itself. <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/d4/86/d486ad1b7cc79408ebe45ff9af704baa.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Glif is made of Santoprene and does not scratch the case.  For the same reason, it is difficult to break, it is plastic and not very afraid to be in a bag under something heavy.  The iPhone fits into it tightly enough, but it does not provide a 100% retention guarantee.  If not successful combination of circumstances, there is a possibility that the smartphone will jump out of the accessory, although this moment simply enough to predict.  The geometry of Glif itself is very well calculated.  Function buttons and a connector are always available, unless you put Glif directly on the corner with the buttons, but in this case, due to the grooves on the inside, the fit density remains high. <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/2e/7e/2e7e3cec7cbdc5923dfbcb9413398e70.jpg"></a> <br><br>  In my opinion, the main function of Glif - mount to the tripod.  But, as it was actually conceived by the developers, it can be used as a stand for more comfortable reading on the surface, watching movies and so on.  In any case, it is always nice when the device, even in standby mode, looks at you, and not just lies on the table. <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/f1/f9/f1f994001924cee629399b245441ea5c.jpg"></a> <br><br>  With a small tripod, the iPhone can be raised to a certain height and placed as a second monitor, even though it is said loudly.  It is very convenient to make video calls via Skype, placing a tripod nearby and continuing to work at the computer. <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/1b/92/1b92080c489a25feeec80cd8437e165e.jpg"></a> <br><br>  But back to the main function Glif.  The developers themselves claimed that the iPhone was literally the best camera they had.  It is clear that if we talk about the photo, this is far from true.  Any DSLR performs its tasks much better than the iPhone, and having a large tripod, but not having a camera, is at least strange.  But when I bought Glif, I didn‚Äôt even think about photographing.  What really interested me was the shooting of the video with a smooth motion and without shaking the frame.  There is no video in my SLR, and the soap box shoots badly.  Here with 720p in the iPhone and nothing to compare.  A graphic illustration of these words can serve as a channel on Vimeo.  <a href="http://vimeo.com/channels/iphonehd">Rollers created using the iPhone 4.</a> <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/82/30/8230906e299285007b17c90d218208ef.jpg"></a> <br><br>  From the above, I can draw the following conclusion: A good, very high-quality thing.  The price, in my opinion, is somewhat overpriced, but the purchase fully met expectations and I look forward to when Glif helps me to shoot some beautiful video. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119584/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119584/</a></p>
