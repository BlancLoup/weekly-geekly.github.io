The law will affect only state bodies. <br><br>  The software should belong to the state, the municipality, a Russian non-profit organization or company with a share of Russian beneficiaries of more than 50% - this is the main criterion that makes it possible to consider software as domestic.

      But as it turned out, the registry of Russian software will not be ready for work within the specified period. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It is entrusted to the Ministry of Communications and Mass Communications to form and conduct it from January 1.  Software developers can apply for inclusion in the registry no earlier than this date, a ministry spokesman explains.  Moreover, the decree gives the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media two months only to develop a software classifier for the registry, and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev signed it on November 16: it turns out that the ministry still has time until January 16.  His representative, however, says that the classifier may be ready before - the Ministry of Communications is already working on it. <br><br>  The government assigns the Ministry of Communications and the Expert Council up to 65 days to consider each application.  And as long as there is no software of the corresponding class in the registry, purchases can be made as usual without paying attention to the prohibitions, the representative of the Ministry of Communications said. <br><br>  The entire Russian software market in 2013 was, according to IDC, $ 4.9 billion (156.4 billion rubles at the average exchange rate of the Central Bank), about 80% accounted for foreign software. <br><br>  In 2014, according to the National Association of Electronic Commerce Participants, government agencies acquired <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP">SAP</a> programs for 5.6 billion rubles, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle">Oracle</a> - for 4.6 billion rubles, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft">Microsoft</a> - for 3.05 billion rubles. <br><br>  The Chamber of Accounts already now prefers Russian software to foreign software, and with the advent of the registry, purchases of Russian software will increase, says its representative.  There are no plans to buy foreign software for the future, he adds.  There are no plans to increase purchases of foreign software at the end of the year and the Ministry of Labor.  Purchases of Russian software will be planned as the registry is filled, a ministry spokesman said.  The Federal Tax Service, according to its representative, will also wait for Russian alternatives with similar characteristics and terms of technical support. <br><br>  On Tuesday, the Minister of Communications Nikolay Nikiforov told reporters that about 150 software products were included in the preliminary version of the registry of domestic software.  Representatives <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE">of Kaspersky Lab</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25D0%25A1">1C</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25D0%25A1-%25D0%2591%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581">1C-Bitrix</a> , InfoWatch, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallels">Parallels</a> <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2015/11/27/618630-goszakupki-softa-ogranichat-postepenno">told</a> Vedomosti that they plan to apply for the inclusion of their software in the registry. <br><br>  November 20, "Megamind" <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/21432/">wrote</a> that the Ministry of Economy and German IT companies are discussing the prospect of selling foreign software to government agencies on new terms.  Foreign companies offer to partially transfer the production of software to Russia and soften the law banning the supply of foreign software to government agencies. <br><br>  Last week, at a meeting with entrepreneurs of the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg (Germany), Minister of Economy Alexei Ulyukayev discussed the localization of software production in Russia.  Representatives of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media were invited to the meeting, but were not present. <br><br>  The Association of European Businesses had previously requested that localized foreign software be incorporated into the created registry of domestic software.  The largest foreign IT companies represented by the Director General of the Association of European Businesses ( <a href="http://www.aebrus.ru/ru/">AEB</a> ) Frank Schauff were asked to postpone the entry into force of the law from January 1 to July 1, 2016.  During these six months, the association proposed to the Russian authorities to work out joint criteria for the localization of foreign IT companies in Russia, so that their software could also be included in the Unified Register of Russian software being created. <br><br>  Mr. Schauff also notes that ‚ÄúEuropean business in the past decade has made significant investments in the Russian Federation and planned to invest in the future,‚Äù but now foreign IT companies may suspend investment programs and even withdraw from the Russian market under the unclear rules of the game, Kommersant <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2845568">wrote</a> . <br><br>  In March, the Russian representative office of SAP turned to the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Industry and Trade with a proposal to conclude an investment agreement, under which SAP undertakes to invest in technology development in the country.  Later, Nikolai Nikiforov, Minister of Communications, said that SAP is in talks with Rostec on creating a joint venture in Russia, but this idea was not supported by SAP top management in Germany. <br><br>  The desire of foreign companies to preserve the Russian market and the flow of money is understandable and predictable, says Yevgeny Vasilenko, executive director of the <a href="http://www.arppsoft.ru/">Otechestvenniy Soft</a> software product development association. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt should be noted that foreign IT-companies are involved in sanctions against our enterprises and subjects of the federation.  Against this background, they are trying to prevent the support and development of their software industry in Russia.  Localize software is not possible, it is not the construction of factories.  The opening of foreign product development centers in Russia does not make the software controlled by Russia, ‚Äùshe reasons. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296812/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296812/</a></p>
