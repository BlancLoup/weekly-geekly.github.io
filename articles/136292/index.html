  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Compact gaming steering wheel Steelseries SRW-S1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I have been playing races on a computer for a long time, mostly Formula 1 simulators. F1 96, Grand Prix 4, Challenge 99-02 ... Now F1 2011. I have also bought myself a simple steering wheel.  Three years ago, I bought myself with my friends on the steering wheel more serious, I have this Thrustmaster Rally GT Pro, without a clutch.  Of course, driving with a wheel is much more interesting, but there are also paddle shifters for shifting gears, everything is as it should be. <br><br>  Unfortunately, these petals are broken, we did not have time to ride a single season with friends.  There were also constantly problems with feedback, it disappeared.  In general, it is known that the mechanics of game steering wheels and pedals do not suffer from special reliability, especially in low-end models.  Coupled with cumbersome, fragile mounting systems, the desire of the pedals to slide on the floor, this makes the use of such rudders extremely uncomfortable and unpleasant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/986/abb/1be/986abb1bef1f0b20708a2effeeba9885.jpg">

      And finally, I became the owner of the SRW-S1, the steering wheel, which has no attachment: the rotation detection is carried out by motion sensors.  There are no pedals either, the gas and the brake are controlled by the petals on the back of the steering wheel.  Yes, yes, the steering wheel must be kept on the weight and turned in the air. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I‚Äôll say right away that in Russia it was not possible to find it on sale at any of the Steelseries distributors, I had to order from the USA.  At the same time I ordered two rugs and two calculators - now I have Japanese calculators, made in China and transported twice over the ocean to the USA and back. <br><br>  The steering wheel itself costs $ 120, another 3.5 service commission, $ 6 packaging and filling out a declaration, as well as $ 45 - delivery to Russia.  Total 174.5 dollars.  The Russian Post delivered all over Russia, the whole package went for 27 days, 5 of them were processed within the United States, 17 moved between countries and another 5 were processed within Russia.  It should be borne in mind here that within the United States they were sent to another city, and here we were simply transported from the sorting center to my post office, where I arrived at 8 am. <br><br>  Everything was packed perfectly, such a box: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/858/ad6/de0/858ad6de0c33cbc68d8ee6090b033e39.jpg"><br><br>  And inside - this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e09/567/924/e09567924613dcf83cc1b1d4284b1ecc.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to the steering wheel, there is also an instruction and a $ 10 card in the game, about which a bit later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9a9/6c9/d09/9a96c9d099e95f97c3d228309d5224c0.jpg"><br><br>  So, the steering wheel.  It weighs about 500 grams, has one wire about 1.5 meters.  The central section is made of very smooth plastic, while the side sections give a very small amount of rubber.  The surfaces are very easily soiled.  Personally, it seemed to me that the steering wheel was too wide, it was a little inconvenient to reach all the buttons.  Perhaps, otherwise it would be inconvenient for people with large hands.  Nothing adapted.  In general, the steering wheel is very firmly made, nothing is hanging around anywhere, everything is pressed very clearly. <br><br>  The way I hold the steering wheel is constantly changing.  Sometimes on weight, sometimes putting elbows on the table.  In this position it is inconvenient to turn it to the end.  Therefore, depending on the intensity of the moment, the requirements of the route, etc., the situation is changing.  There is no talk of fatigue (and the feedback of the old steering wheel created a load), and this is rather a minus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c69/237/ea9/c69237ea9316ad7e6701ec594fcc211d.jpg"><br><br>  The steering wheel works without additional drivers with all games that support the steering wheel.  Of the rotary switches, only the leftmost is working everywhere, it switches 360 or 180 degrees of the steering mode.  For F1, of course, 180 is suitable, when turning 90 degrees means maximum turning of the wheels of the car. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the steering wheel has no feedback, does not vibrate.  Of course, vibration alone does not add to the sensitivity of control, and it is difficult to transmit a change in steering force without a steering column. <br><br>  At the top of the steering wheel there is an indicator of turns, the same as on F1 cars and other series.  Without a driver, it does not work, and after downloading one from the official site, everything is fine.  It shines quite brightly, but you should not look at the steering wheel.  When looking at the screen, these bright lights are visible somewhere below.  Since F1 2011 shows the same thing on the screen, there is little use but pleasure.  This works in all games that support revolving. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/038/7f2/d8a/0387f2d8a5392e3391d23d413a8303a5.jpg"><br><br>  On the reverse side are the gearshift paddles and the "pedal" of gas and brake. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b65/2c8/585/b652c85858815fdd3c7d68c2536c94c3.jpg"><br><br>  They will be easily reached, and, unlike my old steering wheel, it is convenient to press with the steering wheel turned.  Said and the fact that when turning the wheel can be shifted in space, it is more convenient for hands.  So far I have not been able to master the ride with this wheel with a manual gearbox, because having turned off all the simplifications, I encountered difficult pedals. <br><br>  I note that if I couldn‚Äôt manage to drive normally pedals without traction control, it turns out here.  This is probably because it is easier to combine pressing the gas and straightening the steering wheel when all this is done by hand. <br><br>  In games where you can always push the trigger until it stops such a problem does not arise. <br><br>  The gears are switched very clearly, the click takes place at the end of the lever stroke, you can immediately release it and press it again to quickly switch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d51/160/ca6/d51160ca6a723ee687339e5f71e93a5f.jpg"><br><br>  Although the manufacturer of the steering wheel is Steelseries, it was designed for the game Simraceway.  In it, the remaining rotary switches work, allowing you to turn on the assist on the go.  It seems to me personally that this is nonsense, it is inconvenient and who will constantly touch them. <br><br>  But it's cool that all the buttons are signed and do exactly what is written.  $ 10, which comes as a gift to the steering wheel, allows you to buy a lot of things.  F3 car in the game costs about $ 1.  Personally, I did not like the game due to the slow and very difficult to manage machines, but conceptually it‚Äôs just great.  So there will be fans. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2ee/390/fce/2ee390fce85605f6d702bb775ba4f66a.jpg"><br><br>  As a result, we have an excellent compact solution for car racing fans at the computer.  For consoles steering wheel does not fit.  Of all the analogs I know of, Microsoft Xbox 360 Wireless Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãWheel, this thing has no wires at all, but it can also vibrate. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136292/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136292/</a></p>
