I will not talk about the differences between operating systems, about them already written a lot of reviews and thousands of copies broken. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/2f0874d3/5efb4b84/65e53aad/379a02e3.jpg"><br><br>  The network also already has a lot of reviews of this phone, so whoever is interested can find them themselves. <br>  Here I will write only about my impressions, pros and cons personally for me, in comparison with the previous apparatus.

      <b>For those who do not like to read a lot, a brief summary: the device is gorgeous, but has its drawbacks.</b>  <b><s>Not suitable for audiophiles, see the review on gsmarena (at least at the time of the review).</s> Updates all fixed.</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, for the beginning of the characteristics and appearance: <br><img src="http://i.nokia.com/image/view/-/248304/medRes/1/-/Searay-cyan-Side-Right-png.png"><img src="http://i.nokia.com/image/view/-/248748/medRes/1/-/Searay-cyan-Front-png.png"><br><br><ul><li>  screen diagonal 3.7 ", resolution 480x800, PenTile AMOLED </li><li>  MSM8255 1.4Ghz processor </li><li>  8 megapixel camera, flash, autofocus </li><li>  16 GB of memory, no memory card slot </li><li>  weight: 142 g </li><li>  Maximum talk time on a 2G (3G) network: 13 (9.5) hours </li><li>  Maximum standby time in a GSM (3G) network: 265 (335) h. </li><li>  Maximum music playback time: 55 hours </li></ul><br>  Externally, the device looks just gorgeous, there was no one who would remain indifferent, even just seeing it.  The hardware stuffing is also pretty good.  Not supermegatop, but enough to work perfectly for any applications.  All games that I tried go without lags.  NFS Undercover struck me with the quality of graphics and smoothness of work, to be honest. <br><br><br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br><ol><li>  <b>Design</b> .  This phone really looks very cool, just does not look like all the other iPhone-like bricks.  In the hand is also great.  Build quality is super, there‚Äôs simply nothing to break :) </li><li>  <b>Updates</b> , and that says it all.  Update Desire S to 2.3.5 thank God came at the end of November, 4.0 can not wait.  The previous simple Desire update was exactly 1, from 2.1 to 2.2. </li><li>  The design of the WP7 itself.  Honestly, I am delighted.  Everything is very fast, smooth and comfortable.  Yes, it is unusual at first, but after an hour I felt quite confident. </li><li>  <b>Super fast GPS</b> is a huge plus for me.  Before that, my Desire S could search for satellites for 2 minutes.  Lumia 800 gets accuracy at 20m already in the room (he himself is in shock) </li><li>  Nokia maps are surprisingly good, just like their navigator.  They work quickly and efficiently, multitouch and so on.  For motorists a definite plus, because  navigation programs are usually around $ 100 </li><li>  Contacts, they are People Hub - a very handy thing, as it turned out.  You can immediately watch everything that happens in twitter / fb and comment it right there.  Convenient viewing of events through the contact: you can immediately see calls, messages, mail.  Here you can send a contact to your desktop. </li><li>  Pre-installed Nokia Music is a pretty good alternative to flooded music.  Plays all sorts of things from Ineta, for free and all that.  Here you can buy the track you like (it is unlikely that there will be a highly demanded feature in Russia;)).  The service saved me when I was on the subway and there was nothing else on the phone :) </li><li>  Whatever they say, there are enough programs.  Games, in principle, too, and the graphics quality is higher than the same android, thanks XNA.  I am very pleased that paid programs can almost always be tried in demo mode and are easy to buy. </li><li>  The camera - what can be said, the order of magnitude is best that I had before.  It is really possible to replace it with a simple soap box.  See <a href="">photo1</a> (night, a bit of lantern light), <a href="">photo2</a> (day, overcast), <a href="">photo3</a> (no light, only flash, white balance went from behind a tree in the background) </li><li>  Photos can be automatically loaded on SkyDrive.  Very convenient, from there they can be easily shared for everyone.  The same feature recently appeared on Google+ for android. </li><li>  Work with files / music only through Zune (This is also a minus).  To be honest, it's even more convenient for me to shower music through Zun, because  I use it all the time. </li></ol><br><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br><ol><li>  <b>Vibrate</b> really frustrating.  Vibro works only for the first second of the call, after that it is turned off for 10 seconds, then again for 1 second.  No, I understand everything, saving the charge and all that, but it‚Äôs impossible to feel. </li><li>  <b>Button "Search"</b> .  Damn, well, WHO HAD HAD to make sure that she always <br>  opens a stupid search page in IE ??  Deprive the prize, remove the eggs, so as not to multiply! </li><li>  Autofocus walks by the camera, and walks very well.  They promise to fix it in the January patch. </li><li>  PenTile AMOLED, however, is not the best solution.  Especially noticeable on a white background with small text. </li><li>  Eating a battery is not bad, which is not surprising, considering the 1500mAh battery and 1.4Ghz processor.  Again, promise to fix in December. </li><li>  Vindovy Marketplace loses to Android, at least according to the relevance of the proposed "similar" programs.  Well, and in general, not very good, but for myself I found <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-RU/apps/578ef361-c265-46b7-b6f4-63cbd7fbefe0">AppFlow</a> , which successfully eliminates the shortcomings of the market. <br>  <b>upd: the</b> market is NOT bad, but I lack the functionality from the above application, for example <br></li><li>  Difficulties with installing a ringtone (hi iphone).  Described in this <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/ru-RU/howto/wp7/start/create-ringtones.aspx">howto</a> </li><li>  The quality of music playback upset me.  Maybe it's in the built-in player, but the same tracks that were played on Desire S with clean and deep bass, on the Lumia 800, they wheeze with bass and cut the ear high / medium.  There is no equalizer.  I am glad that the effect is manifested far from everywhere. <br>  <b>UPD</b> confirmed: <a href="http://discussions.europe.nokia.com/t5/Nokia-with-Windows-Phone/Lumia-800-disastrous-audio-quality/td-p/1236759">discussions.europe.nokia.com/t5/Nokia-with-Windows-Phone/Lumia-800-disastrous-audio-quality/td-p/1236759</a> </li><li>  Work with files / music only through Zune.  However, if you need to quickly drop files from your phone, the Zune is redundant. </li><li>  The problem is in the formation of names in contacts (there is no landscape fashion) up to 16 characters, FIG will figure it out if people have similar surnames.  The same problem with the track names in the player. </li></ol><br><br>  <b>Total:</b> it was written at the beginning of the article :) In general, I really like the phone, it's nice to use it, I have never regretted the purchase. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Which is characteristic, the topic is in the black, the karma is in the minus.  Thanks (Windows | Nokia) to the haters :) <br>  <b>UPD2:</b> Thank you all, balance is restored!  At the same time added to the lists </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133973/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133973/</a></p>
