It seems to be in the TOP, but there is no traffic on it. <br><br>  Now, according to some requests, advertising and sorcerers occupy almost 100% of the first screen.  Is it bad or good?  Everyone decides for himself, it will still be like Yandex :).  Seeing this, people often ask themselves the question, how can my site even be seen when the entire first screen is full of Yandex services?  Why pay for promotion if search engines just do not visually reflect the site on the first screen?

There are more than a billion sites (an interesting article on Internet statistics in general <a href="https://www.web-canape.ru/business/vsya-statistika-in">www.web-canape.ru/business/vsya-statistika-in</a> ..) , and the search engines in Russia are only two (major). <br><br>  The most annoying thing is when everything is done well with the site, it is ‚Äúlicked‚Äù and all the indicators are normal, and traffic is 0. Everything was checked, it‚Äôs still 0. The site owner is watching the issue, and there are sites from 2007.  The situation is very unpleasant, offensive.  Often this is simply due to a lack of specialist competence.  He can check everything at least 100 times, but he will not find the reasons for the lack of traffic.  But there is a certain%, when just out of luck.  Naturally, in the eyes of the client, SEO does not work after that, everything is bad, etc.  As a result, all this is discussed in chat rooms, forums, groups, etc.  Negative reviews are written much more often than positive ones. <br><br><h4>  Reason 3 </h4><br>  <b>Outdated SEO approach</b> <br><br>  SEO is constantly changing.  In my personal opinion, it is now moving towards integrated Internet marketing.  A simple example: a site without good behavioral factors will not go far.  What to do to increase them?  Work on content, usability, page relevance, etc.  How to improve content?  Get the client to make live pictures, take real reviews, record video, etc.  In other words, as closely as possible to show the company from the inside.  Today, SEO requires an understanding of the client‚Äôs business.  And this is often more difficult than just working with meta tags and texts. <br><br>  For this reason, I would like to focus your attention.  Suppose entrepreneur Mikhail decided that he needed to "promote the site."  In 70% of people working offline, they do not understand exactly how they should move and what tools to use.  There is a phrase "promotion on the Internet" and that's it.  This is absolutely normal.  An entrepreneur should know his business well, and how to move on the Internet is the task of marketers who are not there yet.  He is a marketer himself. <br><br>  Mikhail decides to promote the site.  After studying several trainings and talking with colleagues he firmly decides - SEO is a great option.  As soon as there is a demand for a specific service, Mikhail will immediately be offered many options.  Expensive, cheap, with or without warranty.  In this situation, experts will not even think about business, about the feasibility and effectiveness of this tool.  Once there is a specific request - there is a specific offer.  I myself always did the same. <br><br>  Finally, choosing an artist, Mikhail begins to pay for promotion.  After 3-5 months, the outcome may be 3: <br><br><ol><li>  Michael hit the target and SEO works very efficiently.  Cooperation continues, all is well. </li><li>  Objectives achieved by 50-80%, but there is no exhaust.  It seems that the expert has achieved certain results, but the effect is zero.  Promotion does not pay off. </li><li>  Goals are not achieved.  Everything is bad. </li></ol><br>  With the first and third options, everything is clear.  Let's sort the 2nd option.  Having received the results from SEO only in numbers, but not in money, the question arises: did Mikhail need SEO promotion at all?  Often not - not necessary!  Especially at the start, with small budgets.  SEO is a long-term investment, one of the many marketing tools that is aimed at generating leads.  What else can give Michael leads?  What will lead faster than SEO?  1000 and 1 option.  Here are some: <br><cut></cut><br><ul><li>  Free registration in catalogs and thematic sites; </li><li>  Paid online advertising - Yandex Direct and Google AdWords (not always cheaper, but definitely faster); </li><li>  Cold call; </li><li>  Free chat rooms with a target audience; </li><li>  Soc.  networks - personal page; </li><li>  Cases on different resources or your blog; </li><li>  Lead search services in social.  networks; </li><li>  Crowd marketing; </li><li>  Advertising in large directories: Yandex maps, 2gis, google maps, etc .; </li><li>  Avito, Yula and other aggregators; </li><li>  Business sites such as TIU, PulsTsen, Satom, etc. </li><li>  All this can give first leads from the Internet much faster.  But not one specialist will not tell Michael that now it is better to invest in other tools than in SEO.  Especially when he wants it. </li></ul><br>  Summarizing.  Before you move on the Internet, first of all you need to ask the specialist the question, ‚Äúwhere is the best place to start?‚Äù.  The bad answer: with the optimization of meta tags and writing texts.  Good answer: from understanding your business processes.  Only when a specialist has an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwho exactly your client is, he is able to correctly draw up a strategy for working with the Internet. <br><br>  A concrete example from experience. <br><br><ol><li>  The first contact occurred by phone.  The man wanted a "big and complex portal."  The purpose of it was to generate clients for legal services and subsequent subscriber management.  Linking to CRM and its subsequent promotion through SEO.  There was even a small TK, in structure, etc. </li><li>  The second meeting was held in the office.  The client complained about inadequate prices and terms on the part of the performers with whom he had met earlier.  None of them tried to understand what is really required of the site?  We began to find out what goals the client has.  It turned out that developing a large portal is not necessary at all.  The goals are simple - to attract clients for legal services with a monthly fee plus the opportunity to contact an online lawyer.  For this, the usual landing page for 15000r is enough.  While the performers hinted at the amount of 1 million and up to 1 year, because the client always talked about a large and complex portal. </li><li>  The third meeting was held in coordination of the finished landing and the launch of the advertising campaign. </li></ol><br>  With this approach, in 2 weeks, the client will receive the first client and will pay 50% of the cost of advertising and website costs.  And even if it does not receive it, it will spend much less money than on creating a large portal and its subsequent promotion through SEO. <br><br>  After this incident, I completely changed the approach to work as an SEO specialist.  Now I do not offer SEO without making sure that it is really necessary.  I believe that this is the only way to provide professional promotion services.  Understanding internal business processes - SEO trend 2019. <br><br>  So why is SEO not working in 2019?  Because the usual understanding of this abbreviation has long been outdated.  There is internet marketing.  SEO is part of it, no more.  It is on this principle that I build my work.  For a long time I was just selling SEO, not knowing if it was needed or not.  Now the key action is an audit of the client‚Äôs business processes with the subsequent proposal of the most effective promotion tool. <br><br>  I thank all those who read the article to the end.  I hope I helped someone not to make mistakes at the start.  As a reward for your patience, I will be happy to help with the selection of the most effective promotion tool.
