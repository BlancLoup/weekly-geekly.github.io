      We are settling in social networks, following their laws, and the habra people went even further and found a new religion, the religion of virtual karma and virtual karmic destiny ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  What words came to our life in zero years? </h2><br><h3>  Words in Russia. </h3><br>  According to the Internet community Word of the Year, in RuNet, the <strong>main words of 2009</strong> were: <br><ol><li>  medveputiya </li><li>  anti-crisis, </li><li>  zomboyaschik, </li></ol><br>  and the main expressions of 2009: <br><ol><li>  second wave of crisis </li><li>  strong coffee </li><li>  starving enterprise. </li></ol><br>  Interestingly, the main word of 2007 was ‚ÄúGlamor‚Äù. <br>  And <strong>in 2008,</strong> glamor was in crisis, and significant words were <br><ol><li>  a crisis </li><li>  collider </li><li>  great power </li></ol><br>  Expressions 2008 <br><ol><li>  nightmare business </li><li>  peeling and rolling </li><li>  office plankton </li></ol><br><h3>  World words </h3><br>  According to the editors of the Oxford Dictionary, the world word of 2009 was the word ‚Äúto unfriend‚Äù, which means ‚Äúto remove someone from the list of friends on the social networking site‚Äù.  This word is also unique in that the verb ‚Äúto friend‚Äù in English has not been used since at least the 17th century. <br>  Among the contenders for the word of the year according to the Oxford dictionary were considered: <br><ul><li>  <em>funemployed</em> - an abbreviated employee who gets pleasure from his new status; </li><li>  <em>Zombie Bank - a</em> financial institution whose debts exceed assets, but continues to work thanks to government assistance. </li><li>  <em>tramp stamp</em> - tattoo in the lower back, usually in women. </li></ul><br>  It was this year that the word ‚Äútwitter‚Äù and many derivatives of it were added to the dictionaries, in 2006 the word ‚Äúgoogle‚Äù appeared, the words ‚Äúpodcasting‚Äù and ‚Äúblog‚Äù appeared in 2005 and 2004. <br><br><h2>  What were we dreaming about? </h2><br>  Look at what young people dreamed of in previous decades: <br>  - the youth of the 50s dreamed of being strong; <br>  - the youth of the 60s dreamed of being romantic; <br>  - young people of the 70s dreamed of being fashionable; <br>  - the youth of the 80s dreamed of being sports; <br>  - the youth of the 90s dreamed of being funny. <br><br>  And what was the dream of becoming a youth of zero years? <br>  - <strong>We all dreamed to be legit</strong> ! <br>  <strong><em>Illegal (synonym - stubbed)</em></strong> are people who constantly hang on the Internet and use various gadgets both for accessing the Internet and outside the Internet.  Definition introduced by <a href="http://elenara.habrahabr.ru/">me</a> . <br><br>  Gadgets are diverse and help to upload to the Internet, be in touch, keep what is downloaded, and, most importantly, they help to disconnect from reality. <br><br>  Here are our <strong>helpers gadgets</strong> : <br><ul><li>  laptop, netbook, mobile phone, communicator, - to enter our virtual life, </li><li>  mp3-player, bukrider - just disconnecting from the outside world during the road </li><li>  digital camera, flash drive - for subsequent uploading photos and videos to social networks and storing love downloaded from there. </li></ul><br><h2>  New 21st century disease </h2><br>  This is a ‚Äúsense of anxiety without a connection‚Äù among those who are temporarily illegitimate. <br>  In March 2008, Dr. Jerald Block published an article in the American Psychiatric Journal stating that Internet addiction should be included in the official list of psychiatric diagnoses. <br><br>  <strong>disconnect anxiety - anxiety when disconnecting.</strong> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.handcellphone.com/wp-content/uploads/3-13-08-disconnect-anxiety-pic-2.jpg"></div><br>  Internet users have been spending so much time online that they can‚Äôt even tell how many hours have passed.  They may even neglect the most basic human needs, for example, forget to eat or go to the toilet.  Such users feel angry, depressed and strained when Internet access is blocked or restricted.  In order to get the same satisfaction, they need more and more new software or they spend more and more time on the network. <br><br>  A study from the Solutions Research Group found that up to 68% of the US population is periodically very worried if there is no Internet connection or the inability to use a mobile phone.  The overwhelming majority of Internet addicts are young people, and after 50 years there is almost no dependence. <br><br>  It turns out that two-thirds of the population fell ill from the illness in zero years, and the young people are almost without exception! <br>  Should it then be considered a disease, since everyone suffers?  Probably, we do not suffer, but just live like that;) <br>  The ideas of the post appeared when reading the notes of <a href="http://vadimgalkin.pp.ru/">V. Galkin</a> <br><br>  <strong>Happy New Year!</strong>  <strong>Happy New Year!</strong> <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://babruisk-city.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/novyi_god_8.jpg"></div><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79786/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79786/</a></p>
