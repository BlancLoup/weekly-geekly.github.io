What a sin to conceal, I myself did this in my youth when I could not really appreciate the risks.  But in 15 years of legal practice, I firmly learned one simple truth: <b>if they want to leave you, they will definitely do it, and no contract will help you</b> . <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  When working as a full-time lawyer, I often came across a similar approach with accountants.  I had to take on the role of an arbitrator in disputes between managers and the financial department.  And now, in my own company, I struggle with such "alarmists."  <b>Fears arise from a lack of awareness.</b>  <b>Playing on customer fear is not the best way to get an order</b> .

      Perhaps the horror stories will work on some of the customers who have just started their way in business.  Personally, I find it funny when a client is frightened by cataclysms of a universal scale, which will necessarily arise if he does not immediately turn to a lawyer.  Any business owner who makes a decision will react to similar fears of a lawyer in a similar way, and this will not add to a specialist in authority. <br><br><h2>  Investment in the result </h2><br>  The value of legal services is not in protection from sanctions, but in solving the client‚Äôs current business problems.  Why does a client come to a lawyer?  He needs a ready-made result that does not require additional time for comprehension and implementation.  The solution should be simple, effective and proven in practice. <br><br>  No one needs to dive into the doubts that arise in the process of inventing a bicycle, when it already exists and has been used by its neighbor for one year.  And the question of risks disappears by itself, since  The existing solution has not failed before.  And if you need something special, then there are masters who will refine and polish the solution so that it will take into account any wishes of the client. <br><br>  Therefore, the value of the bike in the ease of movement.  At the same time, it is reliable and completely safe (except for a direct hit by a meteorite, of course). <br><br>  Similarly, <b>legal services acquire value when they help simplify the daily tasks of a client</b> , for example, to ensure unhindered passage of foreign exchange control under an overseas contract, to solve double taxation issues, to comply with the minimum necessary paperwork requirements (for tax, of course). <br><br><h2>  Buying a turnkey solution </h2><br>  Out of the need to quickly solve various tasks, an idea arose to provide the client with the possibility of using complex services as a set of simple products.  Services cannot be tried on in advance; their quality is inseparable from the contractor. <br><br>  Therefore, we have come up with a <a href="http://www.it-lex.ru/store">Shop of ready-made solutions</a> , in which you can order a clear product from experts in their field. <br><br><h2>  How it works </h2><br>  Consider the example of international contracts. <br><br>  1. First, we summarized the team experience with foreign counterparties in the framework of custom software development and distribution. <br><br>  2. Based on the analysis, a matrix of decisions on real cases with partners, banks and tax was compiled. <br><br>  3. After receiving the order, we compare its conditions with the matrix and select the most appropriate solution scenario.  We offer it to the client. <br><br>  4. Coordinating additional requirements to the client in the result, we perform customization of documents based on the chosen solution. <br><br>  5. We discuss the result with the client and, if necessary, make clarifications. <br><br>  6. At the exit you get a finished result that you can trust. <br><br>  As you can see, reducing legal risks is not an end in itself, but a pleasant application for solving business problems. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300712/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300712/</a></p>
