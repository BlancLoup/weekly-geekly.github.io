According to statistics, since 2008, investments in the construction of data centers in Ireland amounted to $ 4 billion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3d7/7be/5e1/3d77be5e1a53407bbe0669b5db474ef7.png"><br><br>  World leaders such as Google, Microsoft, Digital Realty and Amazon (AWS) did not remain indifferent to the emerald island and have already ‚Äúacquired‚Äù their Irish hyper-scale data centers.  Corporations built their data centers in Dublin.  All this contributed to the provision of permanent jobs in Ireland, the flow of additional highly qualified specialists into the country.  In 2009, Dublin became the first city in Europe, where Microsoft has placed its mega-center.  In October, Google opened a data center in Dublin. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/083/626/2c9/0836262c932a43b088e781246b1332d9.png"><br>  <i>Microsoft server farm</i>

      Apple and Facebook are also not going to stand aside and announced their intention to deploy server farms in the emerald country. <br><br><h5>  What attracts builders and operators of Ireland? </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ec2/f1e/68e/ec2f1e68eaac470781bb684a7337186b.png"><br><br>  Although in 2008 the country's economy suffered from the financial crisis, in 2014, GDP grew by 4.8% and by 3.9% in 2015, which indicates a stable political and economic environment.  The corporate tax rate in Ireland is also attractive at -12.5%.  Good connectivity - a large number of transatlantic backbone fiber-optic cables connect Europe to North America through Ireland;  developed telecommunication infrastructure.  23.7% of electricity is generated using renewable energy sources.  Due to the temperate climate, free-cooling technology is most commonly used to cool server farms.  The country has a modern data protection legislation that is compatible with EU legislation.  40% of the country's population consists of young people under the age of 29 years old, 43 thousand students with higher education in the field of mathematics or computer engineering. <br><br><h3>  Apple </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eea/530/bcc/eea530bccb86421e910cb1f378eaad0d.jpeg"><br><br>  In February last year, Apple announced its intention to build a new mega data center in Ireland.  A scenic piece of undeveloped land in the county of Galway was chosen.  The land that Apple was planning to use as a server farm is owned by Irish forest company Coillte.  The locals, however, did not like the idea.  To implement the project, Apple planned to deploy 18 diesel generators, which would become a source of noise and vibration.  Activists sent a formal objection to the project to the County Council of Galway, citing the fact that the site for the construction of the data center was chosen "wrong" and it would be better to locate the server farm near the existing infrastructure.  And the project itself does not quite fit in with the general plan for the development of the county of Galway (from 2015 to 2021).  There are still "pitfalls".  Environmentalists have also announced a boycott of such construction, since the territory of the future data center is located far from urban education, so it will be necessary to lay new telecommunication and power lines to the campus, deploy infrastructure that could disrupt the peaceful life of flora and fauna, bats, badgers. <br><br>  The advantage of building this data center can be - improving local infrastructure and providing new jobs. <br><br>  The project was approved by the local authorities, but the construction did not begin because of the complaint of activists, plus the American corporation is accused by the Irish opposition members of not paying state taxes.  Everything should be decided by the beginning of this summer. <br><br><h3>  Facebook </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0df/3db/f06/0df3dbf069724b26af268368fb378d5f.png"><br><br>  The American corporation Facebook has launched a project to build a server farm in Ireland.  Construction work is deployed in County Meath in the east of the country - not far from Dublin. <br><br>  The project will provide hundreds of temporary jobs for builders and dozens of permanent jobs for data center operators.  The area under the server farm - 31 thousand square meters. <br><br>  This will be a server farm built by analogy of the data center already built in Sweden (just south of the Polar Circle, in the middle of the forest on the outskirts of the Swedish town of Lule√•). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc5/c43/35a/cc5c4335a26a4c8ab420ce8ceeb9dd4c.png"><br>  <i>server farm in the city of Lulea</i> <br><br>  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote on his page on the social network that the new Irish server farm will be one of the most advanced and efficient in the world.  Inside it is planned to host ultramodern servers, data storage systems and network systems (Open Compute Project).  The data center will be powered using 100% renewable energy sources. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/277349/">https://habr.com/ru/post/277349/</a></p>
