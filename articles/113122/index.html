  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Idea motivation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  An idea is a thought underlying a particular behavior. <br><br>  Somehow caught the eye of the process of training, which was carried out with elephants.  The essence is as follows: little elephants tied to a tree with a chain by leg.  Naturally, a baby elephant struggled, a day a week, a couple of weeks, but at some point he stopped twitching and at that very moment he was removed from the chain.  Everything!  This elephant did not go anywhere - although he could do it at any time!  What happened?  With the help of an effort, an elephant introduced an idea, something like ‚Äúuseless to twitch.‚Äù  Moreover, the idea lying on the surface, but not subjected to a critical assessment, i.e.  absolute consent. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Previously, during the times of the Inquisition, they acted in a similar way - whole masses motivated for certain actions.  Some, especially "violent" with the help of efforts: torture, burned at the stake, the rest were motivated with the help of fear, if you are not like everyone else, they will also burn you or put you on a stake.  With the help of fear motivated in the thirties: the KGB, black craters, mental hospitals, nightingales.  They do not disdain even now: if you do not pay taxes, then let Khodorkovsky dream.

      A person in a state of depression or fear is able to perform ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù actions, but how loyal is a person in this state?  Indeed, in his face we get a passive enemy, a compressed spring that can crack so much that it does not seem like a little.  Sooner or later there will always be someone who will say "the king is naked."  In addition, if an employee is in a state of fear, then what initiative on his part can we say, ‚ÄúI would not lose my job‚Äù. <br><br>  However, the times of the Inquisition have already sunk into history and direct motivation by force is no longer so effective and acceptable in society, although there are notorious ones - the nineties.  Motivation by fear, one way or another, has the place to be from: ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt do it, fired‚Äù to ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt behave as you should, you‚Äôll burn in hell.‚Äù  But as mentioned above, the times are not the same, and in order to introduce the idea with the help of force into the masses, it is no longer possible, and the motivation with fear is not so effective. <br><br>  <strong>Motivation for aesthetics</strong> <br>  There is one more way to introduce an idea, but so skillfully that in most cases a person does not doubt that the idea is alien, imposed.  Imagine a situation where the ‚Äúbad‚Äù guy annoys the villagers, tramples crops, destroys houses, steals livestock, etc.  Then a ‚Äúgood‚Äù guy appears and blows his head off with one blow.  Good won evil - beauty, everyone is happy, the curtain.  Idea: you can kill if you are on the good side!  It now remains to fill the word ‚Äúgood‚Äù with a conceptual load, i.e.  what is or who is "good" and the support of the population in the crusades against the Saracens is provided to you.  The conviction is so strongly included in the agreement that it is not subjected to criticism in any way, and there is an unshakable conviction in the rightness of action.  There is nothing unnatural in protecting your home, your family, it‚Äôs rather a matter of well-known events in Ossetia, when the word ‚Äúgood‚Äù based on the idea ‚Äúyou can kill if you are on the good side‚Äù was tried to be filled with false meaning. <br><br>  <strong>Aesthetics in management</strong> <br>  ‚ÄúAnd let us, as a non-material motivation, we will hang photos of the best workers on the honor roll,‚Äù the situation resembles the hero of an honest dpsnik comedy club, the walls are bare, but on the honor roll.  In organizations from employees on the sidelines, I heard more than once: ‚ÄúLet this board be rolled up into a tube and put in your own‚Ä¶‚Äù.  I don‚Äôt understand whether the tribute to fashion or the sweet phrase ‚ÄúNOT material motivation‚Äù appeases the manager‚Äôs ear, but instead of debugging business processes, one often has to observe inhuman tortures in attempts not to materially motivate employees.  Well, the employee will not make a profit twice as much due to the fact that he will be hanged on the board of honor.  But if you precisely describe the whole process for the position, with specific results at each stage, it is possible that the documents will not be lost, and the client will not need to call back and ask, ‚ÄúDid you order goods from us for what number?‚Äù.  With clear business processes and concrete results, the games disappear: ‚Äúlet's be friends against him‚Äù is a beauty, isn't it? <br><br>  <strong>Instead of conclusion</strong> <br>  Conducted, somehow experiment with a pike.  They put her in an aquarium to fry, naturally she began to burst them.  Then the aquarium was divided by glass, in one side fry in another pike.  At the moment when the fish stopped beating the muzzle on the glass - it was removed.  What happened to her?  The answer is terrific - she died in the midst of food. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113122/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113122/</a></p>
