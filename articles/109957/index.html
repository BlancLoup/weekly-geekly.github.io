Today, there are 18 days left before the New Year, which means that the discount will be 18%.

      As mentioned earlier, the Family 10.1 software solution allows you to optimize income and expenses, as well as improve the efficiency of investment. <br><br>  And as for the program itself.  After the publication of the program information on Habr√©, we released an update 10.1.0, which includes the following: <br><br>  <b>Home Page:</b> <br><br>  + Fixed cost accounting on the main (when the 31st day of the month in some cases did not fall into the report).  Fixed bug with displaying the name of the past month.  Fixed scrolling of payment display periods on the main page. <br><br>  + Fixed display of tags on the main page when moving to other months. <br><br>  + Fixed display of the top 5 expenses when there could be a negative amount in the ‚ÄúOther expenses‚Äù field. <br><br>  + Fixed display of some tabs. <br><br>  + Fixed display of credits on the ‚ÄúHow much money is available?‚Äù Tab when debts exceed available funds. <br><br>  + Now you can customize the display of payments on the main page, indicating, show, or not already made payments.  Also, there were two new periods: until the current month (shows all planned payments up to the current month inclusive) and the current year (shows payments for the current year). <br><br>  + Fixed report on tags on the main (when viewing past months) <br><br>  + Improved the "Financial Results" module on the main page.  Now you can choose to compare two months, not only from the 1st to the last day of the month, but also only up to the current day. <br><br>  <b>Property:</b> <br><br>  + Added the ability to save and / or print a list of property (necessary for the insurance company in the inventory of property) <br><br>  + Fixed an error in calculating income from property / property expenses.  Now these values ‚Äã‚Äãare tied to the budget period. <br><br>  <b>Accounts and registry:</b> <br><br>  + Improved import from different formats.  Now, if there are records in the imported file where the category is not specified, the program still loads these records and then allows you to assign the desired categories. <br><br>  + Fixed the error that occurred when creating a check and the filter is on (when the current date is not in the filter) <br><br>  + The deposit has an opportunity to make any income and expenses, and not just transfers. <br><br>  + Now the program can close a credit account if it is repaid ahead of schedule.  Also, information about the loan has become more visual (the program indicates how much has already been paid, deletes payments already paid off from the plan). <br><br>  + Fixed a bug when adding a new category directly from the list of the registry when the created category is not displayed anywhere, but is present in the program. <br><br>  + Fixed a bug where when the filter "Operations for the entire period" was turned on, no entries appeared. <br><br>  <b>Budget:</b> <br><br>  + Fixed linear budget display. <br><br>  + Added the ability to transfer the planned balance for each category during planning.  If last month you planned to spend $ 50 on Entertainment, and spent $ 30, then when planning expenses for a new month in the amount of $ 50, the program will tell you that there is still $ 20 left from last month. <br><br>  + Added the ability to compare the plan with the fact in the "Budget" section when the budget is displayed linearly. <br><br>  <b>Investments:</b> <br><br>  + Now it is possible to plan deposits in the "Investments" section, taking into account the additional investments. <br><br>  + Added 24 new mutual funds <br><br>  <b>Reports:</b> <br><br>  + Fixed all reports that did not include the 31st day of the month. <br><br>  + Slightly improved display of the report "Capital change by day".  Now the report is perfectly readable even when selecting large periods. <br><br>  <b>Miscellanea:</b> <br><br>  + Changed the display of the names of some categories in the monthly report in white. <br><br>  + Fixed an error in the cash flow, with which the sums from checks were not included in the flow. <br><br>  + Fixed an error that occurs when trying to create a Backup file when exiting the program when the directory is not available (for example, creating BackUp on a USB flash drive that is not currently in the computer). <br><br>  I will be glad to hear your comments and suggestions for improving the functionality of the program.  Thank you for your attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109957/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109957/</a></p>
