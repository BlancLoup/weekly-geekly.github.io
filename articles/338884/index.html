With proper organization, it is able to reliably protect critical data, and in the corporate segment, accessibility and data integrity is the key to business continuity and business performance.  The topic of today's post is a backup system with deduplication functions.  Which of the many - you guessed it, but we will not get ahead of ourselves. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ba/612/269/0ba612269fa0fff514abc51c1b1f2963.png"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The implementation of data backup systems allows you to quickly restore information in a variety of situations, but these systems often have several disadvantages.  Here are the traditional problems of corporate backup systems: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Inefficiency</b> : up to 200% of the data is copied per week. <br></li><li>  <b>Slow operation</b> : copy speed is too low. <br></li><li>  <b>Unpredictable recovery time</b> : as a rule, in practice it is much more than planned. <br></li><li>  <b>Not very high reliability</b> : high risk of impossibility of recovery (according to Gartner, above 10%). <br></li><li>  <b>Problems with disaster recovery</b> : there is a risk of loss of tapes when they are moved to remote storage. <br></li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cc9/77a/f6c/cc977af6cd2945b20f3135b35b312faf.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">This is how a traditional backup system works.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Today, we need new backup and recovery solutions that will function effectively in the face of exponential data growth, tougher regulatory requirements, strict SLA requirements, and shrink backup windows.</font></i>

Simply put, it reduces the amount of stored data by removing repetitive data sequences. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f23/fee/6ac/f23fee6ac9ba7c756db58fadb638124e.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Deduplication allows you to send over the network and store less data.</font></i> <br><br>  Deduplication can work at the file, block or application level.  To further reduce the amount of stored data, deduplication is often combined with compression (compression), calling it all a compaction of data. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f93/05e/fba/f9305efba7d3a0c9b3ab21edd30d1be0.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">How the deduplication algorithm works and what it does.</font></i> <br><br>  In general, the deduplication algorithm searches for duplicates (data blocks) and replaces them with a ‚Äúdata pointer‚Äù - a reference to an exact copy of this data object.  Deduplication reduces costs by minimizing unnecessary work during storage and transfer of data. <br>  In backup systems, deduplication helps solve a number of problems and provides the following benefits. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3183c1">‚ñç Reducing backup windows</font> </h3><br>  With traditional backups, large amounts of data are transferred, so it is sometimes quite difficult to ‚Äúfit‚Äù into the backup window, and sometimes it is completely impossible.  Deduplication reduces the amount of backed up data, allowing you to perform backups within a selected window. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3183c1">‚ñç Reduce recovery time to reduce downtime</font> </h3><br>  Storing a smaller amount of backup data on disks instead of tapes significantly reduces recovery time.  The use of disks also simplifies the status checks and other operations to prevent failures. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3183c1">‚ñç Reduced storage costs</font> </h3><br>  Deduplication reduces backup data volumes and, accordingly, reduces storage capacity requirements. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3183c1">‚ñçPartial solution to the problem of increasing the volume of corporate data that require protection</font> </h3><br>  Deduplication allows you to efficiently back up increasing amounts of stored data. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3183c1">‚ñç Improving security</font> </h3><br>  Deduplication in combination with replication allows you to store copies off-site, eliminating the need for manual operations with tape media and increasing security. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3183c1">‚ñçSimplification of data protection in organizations with a branch structure</font> </h3><br>  Data in remote locations requires central protection and recovery.  With centralized backup, deduplication simplifies the process of transferring large amounts of backup data over the network to a data center. <br>  In general, deduplication is widely used as a tool to help cope with the rising costs of backup infrastructure while increasing data volumes and respecting backup windows. <br><br>  If we don‚Äôt go into details, the main reasons for using data deduplication in the backup system are reducing backup size and reducing the need for storage capacity, reducing network traffic, reducing backup window (backup time).  It is possible to do daily full backups to ensure fast recovery in one step. <br><br>  Deduplication backup systems can use various backup storage options, including tape drives and libraries, virtual tape libraries, disk arrays, data storage systems, including built-in deduplication, and cloud backup. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4e0/c29/2d9/4e0c292d9ba0e783bf551736cfda9ead.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Deduplication drastically reduces the amount of data transferred and stored, eliminating IT bottlenecks and reducing storage costs.</font></i> <br><br>  Deduplication reduces the capacity requirements by an average of 10-30 times, significantly increasing the speed and reliability of data recovery and retrieval.  Storing only unique data on disks also means that they can be replicated over remote networks across the network to remote sites for fast disaster recovery. <br><br>  To minimize disk space requirements, some storage systems have built-in data deduplication: it runs ‚Äúon the fly‚Äù (during backup or archiving), so deduplicated data is saved to disk. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3183c1">Types of deduplication and its effectiveness</font> </h2><br>  There are different types of deduplication with its advantages and disadvantages.  Online deduplication (on-the-fly) is performed as data is received, redundancy is eliminated even before writing to storage systems.  This reduces the number of I / O operations and storage, but the deduplication speed should be high enough not to slow down the backup process.  Typically, this deduplication is performed at the data source. <br><br>  Post-process processing provides the fastest possible copying of data, but for their temporary storage before deduplication additional capacity is required.  Sometimes these methods are combined: online deduplication continues until the data arrival rate reaches a certain limit, after which the transition to post-process processing takes place. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/478/838/f2a/478838f2a8062c3ed734613afc440fcc.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Comparison of deduplication at the source and post-process (postoperative) deduplication.</font></i> <br><br>  The reasons for such compromises are that deduplication is costly.  It requires computational resources, and it causes a decrease in system performance.  Therefore, you need to consider what costs are inevitable when using each method. <br><br>  Thus, there are two main deduplication schemes: in the first method, the data is processed on the client side (‚Äúat the source‚Äù), and after deduplication are sent to storage devices.  In other cases, deduplication occurs on end storage devices.  The first method reduces the load on the network, but requires the installation on clients of specialized software, client computing resources.  The second involves the use of more powerful and expensive storage systems, and the cost of the initial data transfer is not actually reduced. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ccb/b65/f5b/ccbb65f5bad00b4944c309236d8f69bf.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Deduplication can be performed at the source or directly into the data warehouse.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Depending on this, the computational load is distributed, which can also change as the block size changes.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">In any case, you need to take into account the relatively high requirements of deduplication to system resources.</font></i> <br><br>  Deduplication is most effective when the data is highly redundant, and also when it is copied and / or saved after making minor changes.  In general, unstructured data like document files, virtual machines, email, and archives give a high deduplication rate.  The volume is often reduced by 20-30 times.  Deduplication of structured data, such as databases, gives a smaller ratio (usually 5-8 times). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/269/a99/861/269a998615393e987cf5cec06899e29b.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">The effectiveness of deduplication examples.</font></i> <br><br>  In some hash-based schemes, data pre-processing is used to increase the deduplication ratio.  Significantly reduce backup time allows deduplication of variable length blocks when processing data on the client side, since only unique segments are saved.  This deduplication method is more effective than traditional deduplication of fixed-length segments, when even small changes in the data set result in a backup of the entire file. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f93/998/774/f9399877483090e5cb8d0db87f58247f.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Data deduplication technology.</font></i> <br><br>  Deduplication of variable length segments, which is performed on the client device, is implemented in the Dell EMC Avamar backup system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3f6/330/8ca/3f63308ca856dbfc03c8b9cde51dd218.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Deduplication in Avamar.</font></i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3183c1">Avamar: solution architecture</font> </h2><br>  Avamar is a comprehensive hardware and software solution for backing up and restoring data, allowing you to work in both real and virtual environments.  It supports data transfer optimization when working with different types of networks.  Recovery is performed in one step.  Avamar can be configured to work with a specific type of software (for example, Oracle databases) and a virtual environment. <br><br>  The Dell EMC Avamar system from the Data Protection Suite product family, integrated with the Dell EMC Data Domain storage system, can be deployed in a variety of ways and complete daily backups with it.  It supports virtualized and physical environments, enterprise applications, network storage systems (NAS) and PCs, data protection of remote offices. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3183c1">Avamar deployment options</font> </h2><br><table><tbody><tr><td width="200">  Avamar Data Store <br></td><td>  The easiest and fastest option, Data Store includes a Dell EMC certified dedicated backup device and Avamar deduplication software.

This allows you to reduce network load by 99%, get by 30 times less capacity of backup storage and reduce backup time by half.  And image recovery will occur up to 30 times faster than traditional backup. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/550/f94/c19/550f94c195657cb6ec0d83e1682b25dd.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Avamar + Data Domain support different types of loads.</font></i> <br><br>  A multi-threaded approach with Dell EMC Data Domain Boost software means that multiple simultaneous parallel streams can be created within a single backup session to speed up operations. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7f7/78b/d42/7f778bd42d1829f84729bbb88dd41e69.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Deduplication at the first copy.</font></i> <br><br>  It is worth noting that the backup of the same data is never performed twice.  The system separates the data to be backed up into variable length segments, compresses them and applies a unique hash identifier for each segment.  It then determines whether a segment has previously been backed up and copies only unique ones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3b8/c96/307/3b8c96307afd89b5a3413a3ee3c9bd66.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Avamar deployment options.</font></i> <br><br>  The Avamar Data Store integrates Dell EMC certified hardware and Avamar backup software with deduplication in a scalable, ready-made solution.

Avamar is integrated with VMware vCenter, VMware vCloud Director, VMware vStorage API for Data Protection, vSphere Web Client, and Microsoft Hyper-V.  There is also a special version of Avamar Virtual Edition (AVE) - an exclusively software solution for protecting virtual environments. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e49/086/72e/e4908672e360c7ba2dc082cb76d9ccfe.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Using Avamar to back up VMs in VMware using the data snapshot function of storage systems and software agents.</font></i> <br><br>  In a VMware environment, Avamar uses VMware Changed Block Tracking (CBT) to track changed blocks.  This speeds up the backup and recovery process.  And throughput is enhanced by intelligent load balancing across multiple proxies. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4dc/1bd/71d/4dc1bd71d2f4d38da43fc217a34134de.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Benefits of Avamar in protecting VMware virtual environments.</font></i> <br><br>  Avamar provides a quick one-step recovery for individual files or complete VM images in the original, alternative, or new VM.  If VM images are stored in Data Domain, you can immediately access the virtual machine by moving it to production with vMotion. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c8d/ec3/a05/c8dec3a0530f951ae7ea12a94ef4c9d0.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Backup guest virtual machines.</font></i> <br><br>  It is worth noting that VMware vSphere Data Protection (VDP) - a product for backing up virtual machines on ESXi servers - is built on the basis of the Avamar solution, which is deployed as a virtual appliance (Virtual Appliance).  The software works without agents, uses CBT and can recover not VM entirely, but also individual files through the browser. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1b5/0a8/5ad/1b50a85ad9836f4d43ebec33015568e7.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Dell EMC Avamar also supports backing up and restoring virtual machines running on VMware vSAN.</font></i> <br><br>  By integrating Avamar with vRealize Automation (vRA) and vCloud Director (vCD), you can use data protection services for a public, private, hybrid cloud, as well as for cloud software.  VRA Extension The vCD Data Protection extension builds backup services directly into the vCloud Director. <br><br>  Avamar also protects data from a private and hosted Microsoft cloud, including Hyper-V and Azure.  Administrators assign appropriate data protection policies using Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager.  Policies are applied when allocating virtual machine resources. <br><br>  By the way, Data Domain Cloud Tier supports Azure, Amazon, Virtustream and any devices that work with the S3 protocol. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c25/e6c/dae/c25e6cdae5f01467ca69b9cbb17914c9.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Disaster-proof solution: backup VM to the cloud.</font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a21/5a2/742/a215a27425b772ba0a4e470c1ee7e08a.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Cloud Disaster Recovery Architecture.</font></i> <br><br>  Avamar protects each VM using an image-based backup method and scans VM files directly into the Hyper-V file system.  Such data processing is more efficient than using agents.  Cluster Shared Volumes (CSV) allow multiple nodes to access all disks in clusters. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3183c1">‚ñç2.</font>  <font color="#3183c1">Backup Network Storage System</font> </h3><br>  By using the NDMP (Network Data Management Protocol) protocol, NAS backup time is reduced.  You can opt out of the long-term creation of basic full backups. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ce/a1f/2c0/6cea1f2c0d21851f953b6b0b0552c559.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Avamar allows you to back up and restore network storage systems using the Avamar NDMP Accelerator node.</font></i> <br><br>  When using the Avamar NDMP Accelerator node, zero-level backup is performed only once, during the first full backup.  Then only incremental level 1 dumps are applied. This significantly reduces backup time and negative impact on NAS resources, simplifies and speeds up recovery. <br><br>  However, there are no restrictions on the number or size of files and volumes to comply with backup windows.  Thanks to multithreading, Avamar can operate in large, horizontally scalable NAS (including the Dell EMC Isilon), providing higher throughput when transferring copy data. <br><br>  The fast incremental backup architecture of Avamar allows you to work with HDFS, while eliminating the bottlenecks inherent in traditional file-based backup. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3183c1">‚ñç3.</font>  <font color="#3183c1">Copying desktop and laptop data</font> </h3><br>  This option allows end users to protect and recover their data themselves - no need to wait for the help of IT professionals.

Data backup is performed automatically during scheduled backup windows when the PC is connected to the network. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f94/b9f/1a8/f94b9f1a82ed02d58c3a9c141bc44fc0.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Users can run backups on demand and quickly restore their data.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">The process is simplified by an intuitive interface and an integrated search engine.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">In this case, recovery is always performed in one step.</font></i> <br><br>  Dell EMC Avamar Workstation Solution is optimal for usability and scalability.  It offers a complete set of necessary tools to protect data from distributed networks of PCs and laptops.  Customers who have installed a Dell EMC Avamar solution will have real benefits from using data deduplication technology to optimize backup and restore procedures. <br><br>  The current problem is protection against the rapidly gaining popularity of ransomware viruses (Ransomware).  According to TrendLabs, in 2016 the number of known types of ransomware Trojans increased by 752%: from 29 types in 2015 to 247 by the end of 2016.  According to Kaspersky Lab, in the 1st quarter of 2017, 11 new families of ransomware Trojans and 55,679 modifications appeared (for comparison, 70,837 modifications appeared in 2-4 quarters of 2016).  First of all, attacks with the introduction of the ransomware are aimed at the most popular operating systems: Windows for workstations and servers, Android for mobile devices. <br><br>  To protect the backup and recovery environment from outside attacks, Dell EMC offers the <a href="https://www.emc.com/collateral/technical-documentation/h15740-dell-emc-ransomware-solution-sb.pdf">Isolated Recovery Solution</a> .  The backup system embedded in the customer's infrastructure (for example, based on Dell EMC Data Domain) is separated by a special gateway from the rest of the infrastructure and is connected to it only at certain points in time for backup.  Data backups remain recoverable. <br><br>  Thus, the main idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãIsolated Recovery is to create an isolated segment of the IT infrastructure that cannot be accessed from outside the network perimeter, as well as significantly limited access for internal users.  This area is backed up the most critical information for the business. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/095/708/7e3/0957087e34a34aae2e95d477eabd64f6.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Isolated Recovery: an isolated segment is connected to the main system by means of a gateway, which is opened to create backup copies at previously unknown points in time.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Stored data is additionally checked for the presence of malicious codes.</font></i> <br><br>  Even in the case of cyber attacks and the destruction of the working environment, Isolated Recovery solutions together with the use of Data Domain allow you to save backups and use them for further work.  However, the implementation requires a preliminary analysis of the infrastructure, identifying the most critical components, developing a data recovery strategy. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3183c1">‚ñç4.</font>  <font color="#3183c1">Backup of remote office data</font> </h3><br>  The system allows you to centralize backup and recovery in remote offices through a single interface. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b4f/60b/17a/b4f60b17a6fa7114fffaeb3567cf2242.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Remote office data protection with Avamar and Data Domain.</font></i> <br><br>  In remote offices, simple Avamar software agents can be deployed to servers without the use of additional remote hardware.  This allows you to back up data over existing WAN links to the central Avamar Data Store system in the data center. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a12/ac5/1a3/a12ac51a361ba46ff0d4163a644e98f1.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Multisystem Management - centralized management of all Avamar topologies.</font></i> <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3183c1">‚ñç5.</font>  <font color="#3183c1">Business critical applications</font> </h3><br>  Avamar provides backup and recovery for IBM, Microsoft, Oracle and SAP applications with high-performance deduplication, as well as management capabilities for application owners.  Unlike competitive solutions, in addition to traditional copying at the image level, there is an opportunity to organize the correct consistent copying of applications using special integration modules. <br><br>  In addition, when backing up to application-specific features, Avamar uses Dell EMC Data Domain Boost software to send critical business application data directly to the Data Domain system.  Companies can unify their data protection processes using this software and equipment for deduplication, and get a backup and recovery solution with high performance and scalability. <br><br>  The system is offered in the following versions: <br><table><tbody><tr><td width="150">  The product's name </td><td width="200">  <b>Dell EMC Avamar</b> </td><td width="200">  <b>Dell EMC Avamar Virtual Edition</b> </td><td>  <b>Dell EMC Avamar Business Edition</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  Description <br></td><td>  The Dell EmC Avamar backup system with deduplication provides fast, daily full backup and one-step data recovery. <br></td><td>  Protects virtual machines in virtual environments and remote offices.

It is suitable for protecting virtual environments, enterprise applications, remote offices, desktops / laptops, and network storage servers (NAS).  Companies that use VMware vCenter, VMware vCloud Director, VMware vSphere Web Client, Microsoft Hyper-V and VMware vSphere API for data protection users can use this software to optimize backup and recovery of virtual machines. <br><br>  Avamar has fast recovery and backup capabilities by reducing backup time and daily storage of changes only, optimizing network bandwidth, single-step recovery, has high reliability thanks to RAID and RAIN technologies, offers different deployment options, scaling to 124 TB with deduplication.  Users of desktops and laptops can use the recovery function for self-service. <br><br>  Avamar data deduplication features are more advanced than other similar tools.  The specificity of global deduplication is that, regardless of the type or number of external devices, sessions, data is copied once and stored in the deduplication pool once. <br><br>  For example, Veeam is characterized by deduplication within a single backup job.  The new next task means that even duplicate data will be copied again.  In the HPE backup solution, if two logical devices are created in the system, then there will be no global deduplication between these devices. <br><br>  The benefits of Avamar include support for protecting workstations, the presence of special modules for backing up most business applications (Oracle, SQL Server, Exchange, SharePoint, SAP, Sybase, IBM DB2, etc.), support for protecting virtual and physical servers. <br><br>  Backup and recovery tools provide tight integration with popular virtualization solutions such as Hyper-V and VMware vSphere.  In addition, Avamar can function as part of the Integrated Data Protection Appliance.  Among the new features of the product - support for clouds, tearing.  Avamar can also offer the option of organizing long-term storage in the cloud ‚Äî both with and without Data Domain. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/338884/">https://habr.com/ru/post/338884/</a></p>
