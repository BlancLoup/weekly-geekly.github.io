And he managed to create a test prototype.  Then he showed this thing to friends and even heard the word "investments".  Moreover, creating a simple page and recording a short video, he even found several clients who bought bracelets and customization from him.  Soon the number of customers reached 200. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At one particular point, he wrote an update. <br><br>  Since the bracelets are not updated on the Internet, you need to inform current customers that there is an update.  Ringing is expensive and lazy.  Sms-ki just expensive.  I decided to send a letter.  It would seem, what is the difficulty?  Connect the smtp-server and went to your pleasure.  But curiosity got the better and our hero decided to find out for what the mailing services take money.

      This is the preamble. <br><br><h2>  What is the mailing service </h2><br>  In this article, we are not analyzing the technical aspects, but the possibilities themselves.  Implementation can be discussed in the comments. <br><br>  So, suppose our task is to send a letter to 200 people.  If you want to do everything manually, you will need: <br><br><h3>  1. Editor </h3><br>  Now there are no problems with html-editors.  But there is a nuance.  The layout of letters is different from the layout of pages.  Not another universe, but there are nuances.  This can be found <a href="https://help.mail.ru/mail-help/rules/technical">in the mail.ru specifications</a> . <br><br>  Editors of mailing services take into account these nuances + often knowledge of css and html is not needed.  Just write the text in blocks and move them back and forth. <br><br>  If you do it manually and independently, you can use <a href="https://beefree.io/">beefree</a> or <a href="https://www.inkbrush.com/">Inkbrush</a> .  Or even abandon the beautiful template.  Who needs it. <br><br><h3>  2. Mailer </h3><br>  We are discussing the option when we will not write a bicycle and try to make it manually. <br><br>  Therefore, we take Outlook, because it is convenient to download the html template we created.  Just be sure to check that all the rules - most likely have to sweat a little more with the html-code, so that everything turned out as it looks. <br><br><h3>  3. Excel for segmentation? </h3><br>  Our hero has 2/3 clients - owners of android-phones.  Naturally, the upgrade instructions are completely different.  Mailing services allow you to divide contacts into segments.  For example, send one letter to iPhone owners and another to android users.  This is literally two clicks. <br><br>  The simplest analog I came up with is excel.  Filters and the CDF function will allow you to create a list.  Filters will help you select the right people, and VDP will help you to check for availability in other lists. <br><br><h3>  4. Crumble the base </h3><br>  Remember what we do by hand? <br><br>  The same Outlook allows <a href="https://support.office.com/ru-ru/article/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D1%258B%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8-b49118b6-c881-44e4-aeb2-dfff0c9b0333">mailing lists of up to 125 contacts</a> .  It turns out that in excel you need to break a segment into pieces of at least 100 people, because there is a chance that you will not be able to send. <br><br>  On the other hand, you can use, for example, the gmail interface.  The main thing is to find a mailer that allows you to send to groups, rather than manually add a thousand contacts. <br><br><h3>  5. Verify your details </h3><br>  Yes, distribution services allow you to specify the address from which the sender's name is sent +.  Therefore, you need to remember to write a normal name in the mail. <br><br><h3>  6. Substitutions </h3><br>  Maybe this happens that for each person you will need to write your own individual key. <br><br>  In mailing services, substitutions are created in two clicks.  How to do it manually in the mailer - I do not know.  If you yourself write your decision, then you need to immediately consider the possibility of pulling data from customer information, such as a name. <br><br>  By the way, according to UniSender data for 2015 in the CIS, 96% of the substitutions in letters are names.  Although it is quite strange - because you can use other data about the client.  It‚Äôs like buying a car to drive for seeds to a nearby stall ‚Äî ponto and fast. <br><br>  As an option, manually enter the names of people and each manually write a letter.  What is lazy - the developers do not. <br><br><h3>  7.Postavit tracking system reads </h3><br>  For the same gmail there is <a href="https://mailtrack.io/en/">mailtrack.io</a> , which allows you to track readings.  If you have conceived the newsletter manually, then you can use it. <br><br>  If you are writing your solution, then you need to add a transparent pixel image to each letter.  By downloading it will be recorded and the opening of the letter.  In mailing services do just that. <br><br><h3>  8. Mark all links with tags. </h3><br>  We need to know where people come from.  Therefore, links should be <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033867%3Fhl%3Dru">marked with UTM-tags</a> for Google Analytics and Yandex.Metrics. <br><br>  Alternatively, you can drive all the links in the abbreviation to have statistics.  But it will badly affect the deliverability. <br><br><h3>  9. Set the alarm </h3><br>  Or connect the module for postponing the sending of letters. <br><br>  Our hero kodit at night and writes letters at night too.  But his clients are half-hipsters, they have 100 messages in the mail every day.  I don‚Äôt want our letter to be lost among the offers of free coffee and mega training on pumping creativity. <br><br>  Therefore, you need to send after dinner, when a potential client is satisfied in the office after a meal. <br><br>  In general, all this is very controversial. Mailing services allow you to track the most convenient time for everyone or send, depending on the time zone.  Manually this is quite difficult to do. <br><br><h3>  10. Email authentication </h3><br>  If you need to send more than 5 thousand letters, then you need to think about this thing.  Well, or just to understand what they mean when they talk about dkim, spf, dmarc. <br><br>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_authentication">What is it in English?</a> <br><br>  Adequately, on the part of the user, this is written in <a href="https://sendgrid.com/blog/how-to-authenticate-your-email-in-5-steps/">sendgrid</a> , <a href="https://help.campaignmonitor.com/topic.aspx%3Ft%3D88">CampaignMonitor</a> and <a href="https://mailchimp.com/about/authentication/">MailChimp</a> .  Worse, but <a href="https://support.unisender.com/index.php%3F/Knowledgebase/Article/View/12/0/nastrojka-e-mail-autentifikacii%26">in Russian at UniSender</a> . <br><br><h3>  11. Wait </h3><br>  Mailing services are working to send millions of emails per hour.  Here you can see the <a href="http://delivery.mailchimp.com/">statistics for MailChimp</a> .  They claim that the letter to gmail will go in two minutes.  From "our" <a href="https://www.unisender.com/ru/features/">UniSender promises</a> 2 million emails per hour. <br><br>  Yes, in our case it is not critical, but what if the idea with bracelets is going to break and you will need to write to thousands of clients?  Then time will be an important parameter. <br><br>  Subjects triggers, transactional letters and automation, I do not touch.  It's too early for our hero. <br><br>  In general, of these 11 basic blocks is any mailing service + they usually very carefully monitor the deliverability and reputation of their servers. <br><br>  And our hero with 200 clients can use almost any mailing service for free. <br><br>  What could be the problem - mailing services usually require consent to the newsletter. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/306052/">https://habr.com/ru/post/306052/</a></p>
