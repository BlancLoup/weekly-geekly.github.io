A few nice things have been prepared for the release, even for those who have never used qvip before.  In addition to improvements, not without a fly in the ointment, about which we will tell.  As we said <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/im/66209/">earlier</a> , it is worthwhile to distinguish between a team of testers and partners from RBC.  Regarding the release, tell the name of the first, about the acts of the second. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  Service News </h1><br>  Honestly, in recent times, partners have been more encouraging than disappointing - just one new nuisance.  So‚Ä¶ <br><br><h4>  Alarma! </h4><br>  In the installer, there is now such a thing as <a href="http://wiki.qip.ru/QIP_Guard">QIP Guard</a> , which, when you change your home page from start.qip.ru to another, suggests again to make start.qip.ru as the start page. <br>  How to delete it, we <a href="http://wiki.qip.ru/%25D0%25A3%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">wrote</a> to wikikvipiya. <br> <a href="http://wiki.qip.ru/QIP_Guard"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5f6/fc4/d84/5f6fc4d84a5f41b956643d457b726d5a.png"></a> <br>  You can swear as much as you want, as you understand, we cannot change it.  We can only repeat: write, complain about <a href="">abuse</a> qip .ru.  They will read everything, and if there are many letters, they will give it to the authorities upstairs.  Perhaps your feedback will be able to change something in the policy of imposing services, but for now only the developer listens to the habrovchan opinion.  But, fortunately, the bad news ends there. <br><h4>  QIP Apps: Free Uchek </h4><br>  One of the key complaints about using QIP Infium is QIP-Jabber, which every user of an uninsulated mode must have.  Democratization is planned in this matter. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      So far, it has been possible to use not only the qip .ru account as the main QIP Infium account.  The list is large, more than twenty domains, plus any of your <a href="">own</a> .  Relative, of course, but still freedom. <br>  Users who are interested are already there, which is good news.  And yes, by the way, all domains in QIP Apps are full-fledged jabber servers with their own conferences.  I will dwell a bit on linking my domains in QIP Apps.  All user domains that are attached to QIP Apps receive all the services of qip in addition, but you can choose to attach only mail, only jabber, or both.  Since the project has not yet been published in the list of services, I give a link:. <br><br><h5>  Account deleting </h5><br>  In order to avoid misunderstanding, it is necessary to describe one more fact: among some users there is an opinion that the removal of the account was promised after the release.  It is not true.  Officials have expressed that it will be <i>possible</i> .  Nevertheless, it may indeed be, but you should not build such an opportunity to the rank of a project‚Äôs obligation to the user. <br><br><h4>  Jabber instead of ICQ </h4><br>  We want to introduce you to another server function that is related to the client and in some way affects privacy.  Its goal is to allow you to communicate using the Jabber protocol as much as possible, and using the ICQ protocol as little as possible. <br>  In 9034, if you search for ICQ contacts or Mail.ru account <i>on the QIP protocol tab</i> , then a request will be made to the server of metacontacts, and if the user of the required number has a qvip account, then instead of ICQ, his JID <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/qip/" class="user_link">qip</a> .ru will be issued. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c6b/b6f/cba/c6bb6fcba2637b596bfcf53ed5b2e270.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  For those who lead a double (and more <i>:)</i> ) life on the network (and among QIP users, alas, there are those who have so much fun), this function is unpleasant, so the setting ‚ÄúDisable JID issuance when searching for my ICQ‚Äù is provided.  The server function, so that it can be disabled on the personal page of <a href="http://qip.ru/settings">qip.ru/settings</a> and in the QIP-Jabber protocol settings.  The webpage has not yet been updated, but soon this tick will appear there. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0e6/a87/938/0e6a87938bb13caa49e11d80b0d01050.png" alt="Disable JID Search instead of UIN Search"></div><br><br>  The function is introduced only for domains included in QIP Apps, for isolated mode and for Jabbers other than QIP-Jabber, the function is missing.  For domains participating in the partner program also works, but only if the account is the main QIP Infium account. <br><br><h4>  Deleting history </h4><br>  Service The history of QIP kept your correspondence using the QIP-Jabber protocol, making it available to the user for entering the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/qip/" class="user_link">qip</a> .ru login and password.  To prevent the server from idle, the function is enabled by default.  Because of this, some were afraid that it might be available to other people and wanted to remove it.  We complained to the forum that deleting everything manually is bad - and one cannot but agree.  We decided that the functions be.  Most recently, one of the users wrote a program that deletes a story.  Now there is no need for it - we are happy to announce that the function of deleting the entire history has been added regularly.  Delete for health - on the main page of the service <a href="http://history.qip.ru/">history.qip.ru</a> . <br><br><h4>  Skins on site </h4><br>  To the good achievements worth noting the appearance of skins on the site. <br><br>  Not so long ago it was forbidden to lay out self-made installers of skins and other add-ons.  It was a very simple thing.  One of the self-made installers patch QIP in such a way that there was a bug.  Developers categorically did not like to spend time eliminating a bug in which they are not to blame.  Therefore, there was such a tough measure. <br>  You can still upload addons to the forum archives. <br><br>  So back to the site.  Skins on the <a href="http://qip.ru/skins/1">site</a> you can try on, download and add your own.  This is all functional simple.  Yes, to be honest, the site is not perfect.  Many claims can come up.  But not necessary.  Those who need to find on the forum archives.  Those who like it - will find on the site.  The main good of this site is the ability to create an officially approved installer, that's all.  In order to avoid unpleasant cases. <br>  The site, obviously, will change.  The plans generally create a centralized repository of all add-ons.  In general, my personal request, do not comment on its quality;) This is the first version. <br><br><h1>  Program news </h1><br>  On this, the necessary information about the services is finally given and we can go to the most interesting for Infium users. <br><br><h4>  General </h4><br>  From the last build, Infium has thoroughly moved towards the habrovchan expectations.  It was decided long ago described <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/ui_design_and_usability/58346/">trabla</a> with the launch of several copies of qip, closing it in the profile selection window. <br><br>  <b>The blog of the QIP project was actively maintained.</b>  The developer and we, as well as the staff of partner services, periodically covered innovations in the <a href="http://blog.qip.ru/">QIP Blog</a> .  We are going to continue to notify our readers about all the news. <br><br><h4>  Functional </h4><br>  During the creation of QIP Infium 9034, quite a lot of changes have occurred in the program's functionality.  Covering all is not possible, and not necessary.  We will try to present the main ones: <br><ul><li>  <b>Improved stability.</b>  The plugins that made a mistake now turn off automatically without causing the program to crash. </li><li>  <b>Compatible smilies.</b>  As part of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/im/65339/">idea</a> of unifying smiles, the first step has been taken.  Added a lot of new smiles (Kolobok Big Pack) By clicking the right mouse button to select, all smiles are shown, and when you click the left, only your favorites, pre-set by you.  In the incoming text displays all the smiles.  Thus, now you can add any smiles from any client, and use your usual set to send.  Everything is documented <a href="http://wiki.qip.ru/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D1%2581%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">on the wiki</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e37/768/afe/e37768afe6be2f10395775e0c7ccf89f.png" alt="image"><br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/0x3wKavN7gM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjbHDb_MujvUAf_Dc12TgHGMVlw-Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></li><li>  <b>Significantly redesigned contact list view.</b>  Now the user can determine whether he wants to see the avatars of the interlocutors or not, to set the positions of the elements of metacontacts.  These actions are available to any user using the <a href="http://wiki.qip.ru/ExStyle%2520Editor">ExStyle_Editor</a> program.  The menu function Settings-Contacts list is activated.  You understood correctly - in fact, this is the first option in a switch that is not enabled by default.  For the sake of experiment :) </li><li>  <b>Changed the logic of storing skins.</b>  Now the replacement of the skin takes a couple of clicks, and full replacement does not require rebooting the queue and replacing the system files.  Skins may contain: <ul><li>  protocol icons </li><li>  customer icons </li><li>  picture status </li></ul>  in this case they will be applied along with the skin. </li><li> <b>Added Facebook and Twitter protocols, as well as support for Juick instantblog</b> .  Yes, yes, on Habr√© there was recently an <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/im/79316/">article</a> about posting to Ruyku from Kvip, but then it was, so to speak, secret information ... And therefore that article was not entirely complete.  Now she would have added, at least, <a href="">this</a> . <br><br>  There are still people on Twitter who do not know about the corresponding protocol in Infiume.  Although they can be understood - not all use night builds, preferring stability.  For the convenience of using twitter, an add-in was added to the protocol of twitter - link shortening.  Who used, that knows who did not use - we advise to try. <br>  While the QIP Infium 9034 release was being prepared, Facebook decided to follow the path of progressive humanity and raised its Jabber server.  But this innovation is still damp and it will take some time to finalize and debug.  At the same time, the use of the Twitter protocol in the junction is more convenient at the moment, it is more verified (since it exists relatively long ago and the sharp corners were smoothed) and a bit more functional.  in particular, QIP Infium 9034 supports posting on the wall and individual notifications, while Facebook-jabber has yet to learn this. <br>  <b>Innovations of Windows 7 are used</b> , in particular, <a href="">tab transparency</a> , pop-up thumbnails: <br><img src="http://s003.radikal.ru/i204/1002/f5/006546c4274f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Specifying a browser to open links</b> , exactly.  Now you can <a href="">specify your</a> favorite browser if the malicious admin has installed IE as default on the system. <br></li></ul><br>  Unfortunately, the memory of a person is not long-lived, and some of the <a href="http://wiki.qip.ru/9034">innovations</a> for us, beta testers, are already mundane.  Now you, the users, have the opportunity to learn all the new items on themselves. <br><br><h4>  Achievements of national security :) </h4><br>  With this motto, I temporarily stop my story and give the floor to the developer.  It's about the digital signature of the QIP Infium distribution. <blockquote>  ‚ÄúFinally, we got our EDS.  First, it will allow us to provide higher trust among antiviruses and firewalls.  On some systems it is generally forbidden to run unsigned software.  Plus, there is a great opportunity to get certified by Microsoft and get the "Designed for Windows 7" tag.  The truth is not right now, for this it is necessary to fulfill a number of other conditions, in particular, full support for UAC, which we cannot yet boast about.  EDS also allows you to protect against modifications of binaries.  A kind of CRC.  From now on, if an unsigned Infium or its parts are being distributed somewhere, it can be safely suspected of being malicious and sent to services like newvirus@kaspersky.com.  It is strongly recommended to run only Infium from our EDS ‚Äù. </blockquote><br><br><h1>  ICQ news or notes indirectly related to qip </h1><br><h4>  ICQ after QIP publishes! </h4><br>  Habrasoobshchestvo, I think not much watching the news of ICQ (at least this news did not slip on Habr√©), but nevertheless there is something important.  Besides the fact that ICQ will be sold, except that last Tuesday her authorization server failed, except recently recalled Java, iPhone and WM clients, ICQ (for quite a long time) updated the version to 7 and launched ICQ Feeds service.  ICQ Feeds is the same microblog of statuses.  Every ICQ user has his own microblog.  Nothing like?  That's right, mblogi.qip.ru.  As in the queue, the function is disabled, but it is turned on by default.  And for all your contacts will be visible to your status. <br><br>  You can disable it at <a href="http://lifestream.icq.com/settings/">lifestream.icq.com/settings</a> <br><br>  Screenshots: <br>  <a href="">Apparently the user who is not in the contact list.</a> <br>  <a href="">What you can customize in private.</a> <br><br>  ICQ Feed allows not only your own microblogging from X-statuses to be maintained, but also to broadcast them to other services.  To deal with this is easy, just give here a screenshot of the settings. <br>  Screenshot: <a href="">Social Network in ICQ</a> <br>  I can not fail to note that the possibility of broadcasting X-statuses to Twitter was offered to QIP Infium users more than a year ago in a plugin. <br><br>  Thanks to the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/bighouse/" class="user_link">bighouse</a> and the community for helping to prepare this article. <br><br><hr><br>  <i>PS By the way ...</i> <i><br></i>  <i>QIP was released, with the first release of the QIP project being the Infium 9034 version. What will happen to QIP 2005?</i>  <i>Never mind.</i>  <i>QIP 2005 will still exist in the working version.</i>  <i>It would not matter to us that people use a modern client and an open protocol, but QIP 2005 remains.</i>  <i>To entice to Infium will be honest ‚Äúbuns‚Äù, as Sega-Zero says, and not by violent means.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Pps</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The release after three years of debugging and testing is still a solemn matter to some extent.</i>  <i>Therefore, I asked <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/segazero/" class="user_link">SegaZero</a> to answer your questions, which he kindly agreed to do on <a href="http://formspring.me/segazero">formspring.me/segazero</a> .</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>He also conducts a survey on what keeps users from switching to QIP Infium from QIP 2005 to <a href="http://qip.reformal.ru/">qip.reformal.ru</a> .</i>  <i>Please do not clutter up this resource with other suggestions.</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  <b>UPD!</b>  I feel, the paragraph about QIP Guard is not clear.  One more time: it is set only if you set the queue in the normal mode or when installed in the selective mode left the checkbox "Set start.qip.ru starting page".  Removal is described only for those who accidentally put this ‚Äúwonderful miracle‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84593/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84593/</a></p>
