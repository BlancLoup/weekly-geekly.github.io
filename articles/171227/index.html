Therefore, when the opportunity to feel like an analogue of the Samsung Galaxy S3, with the cost of only 13 thousand (actually 12990, but these are marketing tricks), I grabbed it with both hands.  I just want to warn you that the review was very subjective, but I wanted to tell you about the sensations from the phone (thank God, there are plenty of objective reviews, accompanied by measurements in parrots of all sizes and colors). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eb0/6d9/e8c/eb06d9e8cbf047f504b37a5739e1f4e3.jpg"><br><br>  The first impression was very strange: to be honest, SG3 always seemed to me a bit of a shovel.  Hell is really big.  So Highscreen Explosion, with the same diagonal, it seems even more.  It has a thick plastic frame, it has a thicker body.  Against it, the SG3 starts to seem like a very elegant little phone.  This is all the more strange that the devices are quite close in size. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/423/b4f/9f1/423b4f9f1db0feb994c055827a32ad0d.jpg"><br><br>  In general, the marketing positioning of Explosion as SG3 analog plays a bad joke with the phone.  This is a very nice phone, if we consider it as an independent device.  Comparison with the flagship of Samsung leads to somewhat overstated expectations, which have to be adjusted during the <s>play of</s> use.  But this is the case when they meet according to their clothes, but are escorted by the mind. <br><br><h5>  Box and warranty </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d75/75b/b1d/d7575bb1d42920b1f55d59345479a604.jpg"><br><br>  The phone comes in a nondescript look box.  Chinese roots (phones are made in heaven under the order and under the control of the domestic company Vobis Computer) are noticeable both in design and configuration.  She, equipment, very concise: instructions, charger combined with micro-usb cable and headphones, which should immediately throw. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/754/7dc/eb9/7547dceb97cda3f278f62fba68e8ace4.jpg"><br><br>  In addition, the box has a warranty card, which is quite unusual.  Instead of negotiating with a variety of service centers throughout our vast, Vobis invested in the box a coupon for sending a free phone to their Moscow service center by courier.  This, I think, is much more convenient and practical. <br><br><h5>  Appearance </h5><br>  The appearance of the phone is very similar to the previous Nexus (this is clearly seen in the first photo).  Related materials, like the back cover bend.  Only this is such a Nexus overgrown. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/37d/6d4/b86/37d6d4b86566c31d597a7d2fade589b7.jpg"><br>  <i>Picture from the review on the site <a href="http://www.mobiset.ru/articles/text/%3Fid%3D7544">mobiset.ru</a> .</i>  <i>So better to see the buttons</i> <br><br>  As a SIM card, the phone uses Micro-sim.  Why this is done, I honestly do not understand.  It can be seen that there is still a lot of space on the phone.  So much that there would not only be an ordinary Simka, but there and not two would be too crowded.  But, apparently, this is also a fad.  So I had to cut Simka.  By the way, <a href="http://www.thechinacellphone.com/micro_sim_template.pdf">this</a> template was very useful for trimming me.  We print, sticking on the back of a sim card, cutting along the contour.  It's simple. <br><br>  It is worth noting that specifically my specimen was distinguished by a certain curvature of the internal elements.  It can be seen that the SIM slot and the memory card are a little crooked.  But this, I repeat, cant specifically my specimen.  In the photo from the reviews it is clear that in most cases everything is fine with the assembly.  So I recommend to check the insides before buying. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c1f/27c/86f/c1f27c86f98c4a17aa59e469a377ae6b.jpg"><br><br>  It is worth making a small digression here: from the previous paragraphs it may seem that the phone has a lot of flaws.  In fact, they are all connected, as I said above, with high expectations due to comparison with SG3.  In fact, we look at the phone, which stands in the Russian retail (in which even the last nexus grows to 20 thousand rubles), only 13 thousand.  I repeat, 13 thousand, with characteristics comparable with the flagships.  After that, you start looking at the phone a little differently.  And the disadvantages of this end, and the dignity begins. <br><br><h5>  Performance </h5><br>  It is clear that with this processor, the phone is very productive.  This is, in fact, the main thing in the phone.  Games go with a bang (for example, Dead Trigger), nothing slows down, the video is shown with a resolution of up to 1080. If you compare it with the same SG3 (this comparison, apparently, cannot go anywhere), the interface works a little less smoothly.  But this is explained by the fact that SG3 is on board Android 4.1 (along with its Project Butter), while Highscreen Explosion has only 4.0.  However, manufacturers promise that in March the phone will receive an update to 4.1 and the smoothness of the interface will grow.  But even now the phone is managed quite quickly, the difference can be noticed, if you only have SG3 nearby and know what to look for. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e7f/7ce/2b6/e7f7ce2b6b737cb09f36119ded68052b.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, the phone has a very advanced multitouch.  Up to 10 touches.  I had to ask for help to take a screenshot, since all the fingers were occupied by the phone.  Why is he needed, for me it also remains a mystery - long live marketing. <br><br>  On the manufacturer's website there are pretty fast firmware.  Immediately after unpacking the phone, I climbed onto the site and downloaded the update.  It is set, by the way, a bit unusual.  It is necessary to download the update to the memory card and update it (it is more like installing custom firmware).  Therefore, I hope that the installation of custom (if they will) will become more or less painless.  In the meantime, there is no need for them.  The phone literally flies. <br><br><h5>  Screen </h5><br>  At first, the screen seemed none.  But here again, the spoilage of ammoled by SG3.  In fact, after about a week of use, you get used to the screen and its IPS colors seem more natural than those of SG3.  The clarity of the screen is also at a height that with a resolution of 1280x720 is not surprising. <br><br>  In general, to get rid of the disease, "the screen of SG3 is better" you need to put both phones nearby.  And then it turns out that the pictures are very similar.  Yes, Highscreen Explosion has a slightly more faded image.  But this is because amoleda colors are bullied. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ea3/dbc/145/ea3dbc14506eb8324651aef5f847755b.jpg"><br>  <i>I had a little focus left here, but the colors were transferred correctly</i> <br><br>  So who has a better picture, I would argue.  By the way, I specifically shot a little to the side so that it was clear that the viewing angle of the phone is quite good. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5bb/04c/a0e/5bb04ca0e43deaf0fb2f01bb5b12812a.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ac4/f77/0a5/ac4f770a56d0edfe4fff478a240bf130.jpg"><br><br>  There are, of course, Highscreen Explosion and a couple of drawbacks.  First of all, the glass on the screen is rather thick; this makes the screen glare and display a little worse than it could.  Secondly, the coating on the screen is clearly not oleophobic, so the screen will almost instantly stain.  And thirdly, because of IPS and good resolution, the screen decently consumes electricity.  Despite the large battery (2500 vs. 2100 for SG3), the Samsung phone has a longer life.  Still, low consumption of Amoled screens and mostly dark Android themes have an effect. <br><br><h5>  A photo </h5><br>  Since we have a flagship, but still a budget one, it would be strange to expect something grandiose from the photo.  But during the day it shoots very well.  At least close to SG3. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/09a/b5f/c21/09ab5fc21c75ee6cb8a0ecdcfc201440.jpg"><br>  <i>On the left is Highscreen Explosion.</i>  <i>Right SG3.</i> <br><br>  The text is also normal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/467/858/fd4/467858fd45d40d0f7f8f47c0cb7b5807.png"><br><br>  If you want to see the photos in the original resolution, they are available <a href="https://www.box.com/s/reefi2ouy4j4x2igi3in">here.</a> <br><br><h5>  Sound </h5><br>  But the sound surprised.  The player plays more than decently (especially if you throw out regular headphones and replace them with something normal).  The sound, let's say, is quite comparable with my regular iPad 2gen.  And this is more than a good comparison. <br><br><h5>  Instead of conclusions: </h5><br>  To be honest, unpacking the phone, I was ready for another compromise.  Understanding perfectly well at what price I hold the phone, I was mentally preparing for the worst.  Again, the first impressions were spoiled by the minute comparison with SG3.  But somewhere in a week it came to the realization that the phone is quite decent.  It works smartly, receives updates, takes good pictures and sounds great.  With toys, again, copes with a bang.  So the price tag of this phone is quite justified.  Alas, I‚Äôm not a very good photographer, so I didn‚Äôt manage to convey everything, but I hope I managed to tell the most important thing about this phone. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/171227/">https://habr.com/ru/post/171227/</a></p>
