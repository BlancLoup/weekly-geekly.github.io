Do we find out the truth?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/529/dac/f63/529dacf634082faf840c785d6e66e721.jpg"><br><br>  In 2005, along with many others, Matthew Thompson, 22, of Lubbock, Texas, was arrested by the FBI as part of Operation Sitedown.  This international initiative of law enforcement agencies ended with arrests on June 29 at the same time in 10 countries of the world; its goal was large figures of the so-called warez scene.  Thompson, or Wicked1, as he was known on the web, participated in the work of Centropy, the world's largest film pirates group. <br><br>  And now, after almost 7 years, this spring, Matthew announced his intention to write a book, his message on the kickstarter said that he was raising money for the publication, and also to get official documents and other information from the government to investigate and his accusations, which he was going to publish.  Later, in <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/i-was-a-member-of-centropy-the-worlds-leading-movie-piracy-group-120526/">an interview with torrentfreak,</a> he told in more detail what this book would be about and gave a small excerpt. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, he writes exactly how he got into this group over time, after participating in many other smaller ones, and what he did there.  And then follows this part:

    <blockquote>  My pirate life went up the hill.  I had access to everything that I wanted, I was a member of one of the largest groups that ever existed.  And then there was a Fastlink operation. <br><br>  The US Department of Justice together with the Interpol Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Office have been preparing this operation for many years.  They were going to destroy the Fairlight, Kalisto, Echelon, ProjectX, and Class groups. <br><br>  In 2001, during Operation Buccaneer, I was also in the business, but it had little effect on the pirate world.  Fastlink was different because Fairlight (FLT) and its partner groups were among the largest and most protected groups on stage. <br><br>  I woke up on the morning of April 22, 2004, and found what could well be called chaos in IRC (Internet Relay Chat).  Centropy's private IRC server did not work, and none of the group was on Efnet or Linknet, and virtually all of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topsite_%2528warez%2529">sites</a> I used were offline for security reasons. <br><br>  When I finally managed to get in touch with several friends of the sceners, they told me that FLT and most of their sites were covered, and that I had better lie down on the bottom for a while.  The fact that the FLT was covered didn't bother me much;  But their two American sites - Optical Illusion and DOH - were also covered, and I was on both. <br><br>  As most intelligent people would do, fearing to go to jail, I destroyed all my hard drives, and burned every single CD and DVD of the blanks I had in a remote field outside the city.  For the next 2 months, I disappeared from the pirate world, until my friends, korax and Dact, told me about a new cool gigabit stomping that was held by a dude named Griffen. <br><br>  Topsight was called CHUD (short for Can't Hold us Down).  Griffin and his website, as it turns out, will turn against us in the most terrible way that you can imagine ... <br></blockquote><br>  So Matthew finished his story, apparently expecting to interest future readers.  We do not know what happened next, but how this whole story ended, it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Site_Down">has long been known</a> .  As it turned out, the topsites of CHUD and LAD were organized by the FBI, they were used to lure and compromise the scenery.  The nickname of the agent who was in charge of them was really a griffin.  As a result of this operation, more than 40 people were arrested and convicted. <br><br>  There were quite a lot of controversial comments on the article, about the scene in general, about the Centropy group, about what he could write and post his story for free; in general, everyone agreed that many would like to buy or download his book.  But most importantly, with all this discussion, one old story has surfaced. <br><br>  Several people noted that the events of 2005, in which Matthew participated, strangely resemble a fictional story, shown at the same time in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/150239/">series ‚Äúscene‚Äù</a> , and that it is still unclear whether this coincidence was accidental or not.  Matthew confirmed that he was going to shed light on this in his book.  What were these events? <br><br>  The show is about a fictional, but also the world's largest film group, against which the FBI has been developing plans for many years.  At the beginning of June (3 weeks before the sitedown operation) the 9th episode of the series came out, in which a new character suddenly appeared, under the nickname ‚Äúgriffin‚Äù, and at the time when this happened, the instrumental composition of the Temple City group ‚ÄúParanoid Delusions‚Äù played in the background in which the phrase ‚ÄúHe works for the FBI‚Äù was repeated several times. <br><br>  Immediately after the arrests, in early July 2005, speculation began on the Internet about whether the authors of the series (many of whom, according to their admission, could not have been experienced) could try to warn everyone about the upcoming operation.  Information appeared on Bruce Forest, one of the founders of the company that filmed the series, and at the same time reviewed the state of the pirate world for MPAA and RIAA. <br><br>  In general, in the film you can, if you wish, find many strange coincidences with real events and names, especially since it was beneficial for the authors to increase their popularity, but the coincidence with the griffin - as one commentator noted, of all the existing conspiracy theories - is the most plausible.  The authors even published an official response, where they claimed that they could not have known about the plans of the FBI, and that they came up with a nickname themselves, hence the coincidence is accidental. <br><br>  Since then, there has been no information about the book or Thompson itself.  I will not judge what thoughts could arise from the FBI or sceners about a man who was going to tell in detail about the events of those years.  Do we ever know what actually happened then, or will it remain a mystery forever?  Most likely, it will become clear in the coming years. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/154875/">https://habr.com/ru/post/154875/</a></p>
