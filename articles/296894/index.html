There are textbooks on how a support agent should behave, but customer support is a two-way street, and traffic rules for the clients themselves will help not to get stuck in traffic and get to the goal faster (and safer).  Support has strong advice for the client, and we‚Äôll talk about them today. <br><br>  <b>Look at the sign</b> <br>  You do not pass the purchase on the card in the store.  Shout at the seller, call the administrator, call the terminal manufacturer or contact your bank?  Having made the right choice, you will be halfway to solving the problem.  Will the client wander in the darkness or come out on the illuminated road, it is decided just at this important moment of choice - who will help?  Forget about Zappos call center, where you can order pizza along with the purchase of boots.  In reality, support is only responsible for its service within its competence.  The seller with all the desire will not check the account on your card, and the bank employee will not agree on a discount for you.  Go where they can help you, demanding the impossible, you just delay the decision and attract disappointment. <a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>Select expression</b> <br>  Problems have arisen and you tear and toss, throwing lightning bolts at the support agent, who at this moment is the embodiment of poor service and product for you.  But your volume and rudeness do not correlate with the speed and quality of the decision.  A good support will still help, but a bad one will not.  Instead of convulsive dialing and ‚ÄúI'll arrange it for you there‚Äù, exhale, count to 10 and then call.  If you decide to write - write.  Now reread and delete the first option.  Write again and check before sending the number of exclamation marks - there should be no more than one.  Your anger and frustration can be justified, but let the support see the problem behind them, it will help to solve it faster. <br><br>  <b>Tell a story</b> <br>  Remember this game, when the leader thinks of the situation, and the guesser asks questions that can only be answered with Yes or No.  Typical customer situation with support.  What happened, only the client knows.  But does not say.  We have to torture - the process is unpleasant for both parties. <br>  In secret: in the support there are no people with extrasensory abilities, the ability to read on the ball and coffee and tea grounds and see the past and the future.  Introduce yourself, tell us what happened in order, give details.  This will save you from additional questions, incorrect forwarding and delaying the solution.  Yes, in another support, Sherlock Holmes is sitting, who, one by one, unravels a tangle.  But if the support does not have a <a href="http://usedesk.ru/">helpdesk with your history of calls</a> , then it is difficult. <br>  The more you describe the problem, the faster it will be solved. <br><br>  <b>Do not tell stories</b> <br>  To fix - describe (attention - Keyword) problem.  ‚ÄúYesterday we were given a salary, usually it is issued on the 30th day, but the accountant goes on vacation and therefore it was issued earlier.  I went to pay for the loan, but the department was already closed, and I had to stand in a traffic jam for half an hour to get to another.  On the way, the trolley bus broke down, I was late, because I had to pick up the child from school and take him to the music school, because they had a lesson ... ‚Äù.  If you heard snoring from a pipe, then it's time to get closer to the point.  The story of your whole life may be exciting, but a support specialist would prefer to find out as soon as possible how he can help.  If you wrote an email, you could hardly have spread it over several pages.  Therefore, calling in support, formulate the essence: what, when, how much, <s>with whom</s> . <br><br>  <b>Add screenshots</b> <br>  If you are not Leo Tolstoy and the descriptions are not your strong point, then it is better to send a picture of your mistake.  PrintScreen is a contra-ve.  It's simple:) It‚Äôs better to see support once, than to exhaust you with clarifying questions.  Do not forget a few words under the picture; a picture without a signature is a bad helper. <br><br>  <b>Wait a minute</b> <br>  Posted in support - take a break.  Drink coffee, eat Twix.  Hands again pulled to the keyboard?  Stop, wait a bit more.  Give time to read your letter.  The correct support with an auto answer will immediately tell you how long to wait.  If this does not happen, and the question is urgent - better call immediately.  10 letters every five minutes will not help, but only confuse support. <br><br>  <b>Give thanks</b> <br>  Good to share more difficult, it is not enough.  But if you are not greedy, it will ricochet.  Have you been helped?  Call, say ‚Äúgood job‚Äù - positive feedback charges and motivates even the most gloomy agent.  Your one thank you smile will spill over 100 calls after you.  And still catch life hacking - praise the company in public and you will be included in the list of VIPs, which now can not be disappointed.  On the emotions built any relationship, including between the client and the company.  Lay the foundation warmly and trust - and let it be already ‚Äúnot only business‚Äù. <br><br>  There is no problem of the company or "your" problem.  What arises between is always a common problem and must be solved together.  Do not fight with support, be for one thing, take a step forward - and your contribution to quality service will be rewarded. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296894/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296894/</a></p>
