This model was one of the first in Russia to ‚Äúlearn‚Äù to record video at a resolution of 1296p (2304 x 1296 pixels), which in RuNet is commonly called Super Full HD or even Mega Full HD.  This is a kind of intermediate option between Full HD and Ultra HD, that is, 4k.  I bet that in the course of a couple of years such registrars will appear on the market, but for now the maximum for ‚Äúblack boxes‚Äù is exactly 1296p. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c7f/937/79f/c7f93779f9b6f840ac0c9911cf085b3c.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To begin with, I‚Äôll give you some numbers in order not to return to them below: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Possibility of loop recording: yes, fragments of 1 or 5 minutes. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Video resolution: 2304 x 1296, 1920 x 1080 and 1280 x 720 pixels (frequency - 30 fps in all cases). <br>  ‚Ä¢ Photo resolution: up to 3 megapixels. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Diagonal viewing angle: 110 degrees for Super Full HD and Full HD and 120 degrees for 720p. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Recording format: H.264 / MOV. <br>  ‚Ä¢ G-sensor to protect the "emergency" video from erasing: yes, 7 degrees of sensitivity. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Motion sensor: is;  If the object moves in the field of view of the camera for 1 second or longer, the recorder will automatically start recording. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Auto-shutdown of the device as a whole or its screen (off / 30 s / 60 s). <br>  ‚Ä¢ Automatic recording start when the engine is turned on: yes. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Battery: there is, the capacity is 500 mAh, enough for half an hour of recording in Super Full HD. <br>  ‚Ä¢ LED-backlight: there is (it can be useful for shooting the scene of an accident from the side in the dark or to illuminate the gloomy face of the ‚Äúseller of striped sticks‚Äù who stopped you in the evening). <br><br>  With the basic functions (more precisely, with their presence), I think, we figured out, and now I smoothly turn to other features of AdvoCam-FD7 Profi-GPS, which cannot be described with numbers.

    <h5>  Equipment </h5><br>  The recorder is well equipped, and the matter is not even in the availability of those other accessories, but rather in the approach to their implementation.  In particular, the length of the power cord reaches 3 meters, so that it can be laid under the cabin casing so that the cord does not dangle over the latter.  The plug for the cigarette lighter jack has a USB port, so that in parallel with the AdvoCam-FD7 Profi-GPS you can charge a GPS navigator, tablet computer, smartphone or some other gadget without buying a splitter (it costs a penny, but the fact that his purchases are usually annoying). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/032/f48/990/032f4899013e92a8d8f7d0c82eff1f47.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d07/cbc/f68/d07cbcf68732a7d9838907ea4192607f.jpg"><br><br>  The spotting is relatively compact and very comfortable.  The holder consists of two parts that are connected by a hinge.  This means that the registrar can at any time turn in the direction of the driver's door to record a conversation with the inspector.  At the same time, the hinge is tight enough so that when driving on the famous Russian roads AdvoCam-FD7 Profi-GPS does not change position due to shaking.  The ‚Äúblack box‚Äù is powered through the holder, so that you can remove the device in one motion, without disconnecting the cable.  It is also very convenient.  (At the same time, the AdvoCam-FD7 Profi-GPS also has a miniUSB port, so the device can also be charged at home, from an outlet or computer.) The recorder is fixed to the glass using a suction cup, the air from under which is removed with a special pen.  She also serves in combination as a GPS-antenna. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aa8/218/3e1/aa82183e1e1ad2a0efed99e310a96c3f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4eb/31e/ede/4eb31eedefe0c44b4d4d0ffa9a746edd.jpg"><br><br>  Also included in the delivery package is a USB-miniUSB cable, a driver disk, instructions, a warranty card and a 4 GB microSD memory card.  It holds up to half an hour of recording in 1296p format, which is probably enough for most users (provided that the cyclic mode is used).  There are no AV or HDMI cables, although these interfaces are supported;  I personally do not see anything terrible in the absence of such "shoelaces" - I do not know a single person who would connect the DVRs to the TV.  All my friends use USB cables or card readers. <br><br>  Yes, I almost forgot: even in the box was found a brochure of the president of the board of legal protection of motorists Viktor Travin, which outlines how to behave properly in the event of a traffic accident.  It may well be that this brochure will be useful to someone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2a8/faa/1eb/2a8faa1ebaf2c519e7d092da9604b0f0.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Appearance, control keys and screen </h5><br>  Actually, I rarely came across registrars who were pleasant to pick up.  Expensive models are more or less, but the budget ones ... Here you have both curved panel joints, and cheap glossy plastic that instantly collects scratches / scuffs, and dangling elements, and burrs ... Meanwhile, the AdvoCam-FD7 Profi-GPS body just made a very nice impression: the device is almost perfectly assembled, and its panels are trimmed with gray soft-touch plastic.  I remember, about the same material (and in terms of color, and in terms of tactile sensations) was in HTC Sensation.  But in terms of design, the AdvoCam-FD7 Profi-GPS is rather secondary: it differs little from the AdvoCam-FD5 Profi-GPS model.  Although I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with that - design and design, China doesn‚Äôt give up, the car‚Äôs interior doesn‚Äôt spoil it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f9/28e/b65/2f928eb65a01c084a1e1f10aa090badd.jpg"><br><br>  Separately, I note a special influx on the back side (that is, looking at the road) side of the body: thanks to this element, which is found, by the way, in cameras, it is easier to hold the device in your hands. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1c1/17c/c53/1c117cc5317118c4450c94c33b7897a9.jpg"><br><br>  The control keys in AdvoCam-FD7 Profi-GPS are six pieces - two to the left and right of the screen, as well as a couple on the top edge of the case.  All buttons are rubberized and have a clear course.  Most of the key functions (start and stop recording, take a photo, etc.) are available with one click;  AdvoCam developers prefer to call this One Touch system (‚Äúone touch‚Äù). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ca/b34/01d/0cab3401d79767fd0a703342c0f30fab.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/303/554/d05/303554d0550590937bd728c97465912a.jpg"><br><br>  The screen of the 2.7-inch model - today such a diagonal is the standard for more or less expensive recorders.  The display is not bad, but no more than that: a couple of months ago my colleague published a review of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/203954/">the AdvoCam-FD5S Profi-GPS model</a> , as it has a 3-inch screen, and it is noticeably better - in the picture it is generally comparable with smartphones.  The AdvoCam-FD7 Profi-GPS is a bit worse with this, for the primary viewing of photographs and video clips the screen has enough features, but it‚Äôs better to carry out a detailed review of the content on the computer. <br><br><h5>  Video recording and photography </h5><br>  I‚Äôll say right away that I really liked the AdvoCam-FD7 Profi-GPS video quality: it produces good and detailed videos both during the day and at night (there are examples below).  There is no high resolution merit (of that 1296p), but rather for the high quality it is worth thanking a good set of hardware components.  It includes the Ambarella A7 processor (the flagship line of this company, although the exact processor model, alas, is not specified), a lens with 5 lenses made of coated glass and an Aptina matrix.  The latter is known just as the matrix for professional video surveillance systems. <br><br>  Car license plates are distinguishable at a distance of about 15 meters by day and 10 meters by night.  "Stars" from the lanterns, windows and car headlights on the video is not observed. <br><br>  On the video and photos, you can impose stamps of car license plates, time, date, speed and logo of AdvoCam.  The correct option, which, alas, is not found in all registrars. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/leyX1lJ5qq8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhaEE2lKWQWwpTRogK2YGl7RyViEQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/AtcoAPT4-xM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjELkMzmWMyWOKMdd5G7ELND4If7Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Of the pleasant moments, I note 256 MB of internal memory: you can copy an emergency video clip into it before giving the memory card to the inspector.  True, in order for such a procedure to become possible, it is necessary to set in the settings a cyclic record with passages by the minute.  Then the file in Super Full HD resolution will fit on this 256 MB drive. <br><br>  A couple of thoughts on the resolution of Super Full HD - is it necessary?  On the one hand, the difference with 1080p on a laptop with a screen resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels (which is the most common today) you will not notice.  On the other hand, the recorder is not a smartphone, and the life of a successful and reliable ‚Äúblack box‚Äù can be two years or five.  And there you look popularized and higher resolution.  Already, there are MacBooks with Retina screens, as well as Windows laptops and LCD monitors with high-resolution displays, too.  And then: this resolution can be useful for creating a freeze frame, because it can be much easier to see the same car numbers than on the video itself.  And the higher the resolution of the freeze frame, which is actually a picture, the higher the probability of something to consider. <br><br>  AdvoCam-FD7 Profi-GPS can take pictures: the maximum resolution of images is 3 megapixels.  Quality at the level of middle class smartphones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1bf/25b/746/1bf25b746d503d95b76c07cce3768c4a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b74/e7f/88a/b74e7f88a0072a37abe787a4425b53fc.jpg"><br><br><h5>  In the dry residue </h5><br>  I did not find any serious flaws in the device.  Although, of course, I would like to see here a screen from AdvoCam-FD5S Profi-GPS and at least 2 gigabytes of internal memory.  To ensure that it is guaranteed to fit a 5-minute segment of the video.  But these are rather not flaws, namely wishes.  Otherwise, everything is good: the quality of the recording, and ergonomics, and the assembly, and equipment.  For AdvoCam-FD7 Profi-GPS ask about 7 thousand rubles.  If the GPS module seems to you to be an extra component (like me, for example), then you can save a little and take AdvoCam-FD7 Profi in 6 or so few.  But in this case, you will have to say goodbye not only to the GPS module, but also to the G-sensor - the simplified model is also devoid of it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/211510/">https://habr.com/ru/post/211510/</a></p>
