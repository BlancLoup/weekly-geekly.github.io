Any speech is selected by the program committee.  Let's try to show how everything works. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  We already wrote in the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/scrumtrek/blog/348694/">previous post</a> that earlier our program committee consisted of ScrumTrek employees.  We ourselves selected reports and worked with speakers, but this year we have more than 200 applications for speeches, and it became clear that we need to expand. <br><br>  9 topics have been announced on AgileDays 2018.  Each topic is the future track of the conference.  Each track has its own curator.  Inside, we call him "track producer."

In this case, the team of guys from Octoberry, who help companies make successful products and services and increase the expertise of product managers. <br><br><h2>  What the producer is responsible for </h2><br>  First of all - for the "purity" of the topic.  The producer ensures that the reports correspond to the general concept of the track, which he, by the way, can clarify and change. <br>  Technically, the system works like this: a request for a speech arrives at the site.  On the board of the program committee, a card of a potential speaker is created automatically with a note about the chosen topic.  The producer of the corresponding track receives notification of a new application.  If the topic of the report corresponds to the stated topic of the track, the application is accepted to work. <br><br>  Of course, alone, the producer physically cannot physically check all the reports, so we, in consultation with the rest of the program committee, also attract assistant reviewers.  A reviewer is always an experienced speaker and competent expert. <br>  We don‚Äôt hide information about revisions and producers anywhere.  On the contrary, we proudly <a href="https://agiledays.ru/speakers/">announce</a> them on our conference website. <br><br><h2>  How we work with speakers </h2><br>  Inside, we call this process a review of the report.  We will use this terminology here. <br><br><h3>  Why do you need a review? </h3><br><ul><li>  Understand whether the report is suitable for a conference or not: relevant, interesting, whether Agile and so on do not contradict the topic. </li><li>  Give feedback to the speaker on the content, style of presentation, presentation, so that the report is really cool. </li></ul><br><h3>  How is the review </h3><br><ul><li>  We agree on a 30 minute call with the speaker.  We ask him to prepare a draft presentation or at least empty slides with titles.  This will help the speaker at a preliminary stage to think a little about his story. </li><li>  5 minutes - acquaintance, story about the purpose of the review and format of the review. </li><li>  We usually tell the speaker that the purpose of the review is to help him make a cool report through feedback. </li><li>  10 minutes - a short story speaker.  At this time, it is better not to interrupt it and record feedback during these 10 minutes. </li><li>  15 minutes - feedback feedback in the dialogue mode. </li><li>  If necessary, we agree on the next call. </li></ul><br><h3>  What to look for when reviewing </h3><br>  <b>Presentation style</b> <br><br>  It is advisable that it be informal, as if you are communicating with your team or friends. <br><br>  <b>Illustrations, artifacts</b> <br><br>  We always recommend inserting photographs (boards, teams, meetings, etc.), screenshots (Jira, requirements, ekselek, etc.) into the presentation.  In the presence of such artifacts, your report does not look like an empty theory, and it is easier for people to perceive information and ‚Äúground‚Äù it. <br><br>  <b>Format</b> <br><br>  One of the proven and effective is Story Telling.  In this format, the report is based on the principle of stories or fairy tales: there is a main character who finds himself in a difficult situation, tries to get out of it, but he does not work, he reflexes, comes up with a solution, and it works.  The presentation of cases is based on this principle.  This style of presentation involves the participants, makes them empathize.  But, of course, you can use other presentation formats.  For example, if we are talking about a review report. <br><br>  <b>Hall involvement</b> <br><br>  It is advisable to periodically throw questions into the hall so that the participants turn on and think out the report.  This allows for engagement.  For example, feel free to ask the audience how they would act in such and such a situation, what tools they would use to solve such and such problems, etc. <br><br>  <b>Text minimum</b> <br><br>  Beaten advice, which is still little listened to :) In presentations, it is desirable to avoid a large amount of text, otherwise you put the conference participants to make a choice, either read the text or listen to the speaker.  Try to use more visual images and short phrases in large print, fixing the main ideas. <br><br>  And, perhaps most important, the report should have been interesting :) <br><br>  For our speakers, we do special training in the evenings to help prepare ourselves even better and hone elocution skills. <br><br><h2>  Formal requirements for reports </h2><br>  When registering an application on the site, any speaker will get acquainted with our rules: <br><br><ul><li>  Compliance with at least one of the topics of the conference. </li><li>  Minimum theory, maximum case studies / practical experience. </li><li>  Focus on solving a single problem (or several related problems).  Too general reports, such as ‚ÄúHow Agile works with us,‚Äù will be rejected.  Reports where there are no issues or advertising present will be rejected. </li><li>  If you have already had a similar report at a conference, you should explain to the program committee what the differences will be. </li></ul><br>  <b>We do not consider:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  theoretical reports and reports in the spirit of ‚Äúas I understood what Agile is‚Äù; </li><li>  reports of Agile-consultants without case studies and specifying the names of specific companies where these cases were; </li><li>  about your own pseudo-scrum; </li><li>  selfPR; </li><li>  obvious things, for example: scrum in a small studio for 6 people; </li><li>  silage scrum, for example: scrum in sales (unless they are on the supply chain of value). </li></ul><br>  In conclusion, the rules are the same for everyone and there are no exceptions, including the conference sponsors.  All our sponsors know that you can‚Äôt just pay money and come with an advertising report or not go through a review on the basis that ‚Äúwe pay you money‚Äù.  In fairness, all sponsors treat this with understanding and gratitude.  It is important to explain in advance that a bad performance will be remembered much brighter than the sponsor's logo on badges and press will, which means that sponsorship money will be wasted. <br><br>  We hope that this post will be useful both to our speakers and conference participants, who want to understand why the program turned out exactly the same, and brave people who are dreaming, and maybe are already preparing their own IT events. <br><br>  Come to us on March 22 and 23!  The program is very rich.
