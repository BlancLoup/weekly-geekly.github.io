What managers are not learning, playing computer games. ‚ÄùPublished in Gazette. <br><br>  ‚ÄúFor three years in the Russian multiplayer online game DestinySphere, the PsiCorp clan was considered one of the most dangerous: it seized resources, won wars, expanded its social influence.  The clan consisted of about a hundred people, one of its creators, as well as a coordinator for foreign policy and intelligence, was a user with the inconspicuous nickname stmd.  Pavel Pavlyukov was hiding behind him, while he was a private entrepreneur, and now the general director of the Ivanovo Internet provider Severtelekom. ‚Äù <br><br>  Other positive examples in the article are from IBM, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and Stanford University.

      The text of the article in <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article.shtml%3F2007/07/24/129728">Vedomosti</a> for July 24, 2007, and personal experience below. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Personal experience, however, is strictly negative. <br>  The first time I got hooked on the game year in 1985-86 (+ - 2 years).  It was a Digger, by car which brand I can not remember.  Time, fortunately, was limited, but several sessions of several hours caused vivid pictures in memory and trembling in the fingers for another six months. <br><br>  In the late 80s he played a lot on his own Sinclair Spectrum, but there were no serious dependencies, he was happy to switch to programming in the built-in basic. <br><br>  I bought for a non-resident comrade the newest computer (Pentium 1, probably) and, as a test, played about 6 hours in the Heretic without stopping.  A few days after going to the institute, I looked around the corner and abruptly turned around at the rustle. <br><br>  The next time covered in 1997.  Instead of preparing for the defense of a diploma, trampled insidious NODs in Command &amp; Conquer on 386 machines.  Crawling all very slowly, but fascinating.  A couple of weeks went by in an almost zombie state - 4-6 hours of play per day / night and pictures from the game in between.  This period, fortunately, quickly ended - he even went to the army with relief.  For several days he mentally drove the tanks across the painted floor of the barracks, and then new impressions drove the game out. <br><br>  In the army, by the way, glanced at the real gamers.  He worked in accounting or financial department as a civilian, aged 23-24, he had something wrong with the musculoskeletal system and was very uncommunicative himself, but he was good at computers.  Somehow there was no electricity for several days, I went to headquarters and saw how he walked through the corridors, with an absent view, sifting through his fingers and looking unhappy, although in the connected state - quite adequate. <br>  Now the only game I play is balls on a PDA.  It is difficult to sit on it, but it still interferes.  When I do something difficult or difficult to make a call, I‚Äôll take the communicator and I will play balls for 2-3 games.  And when tired, it turns out not 2-3, but 10, you lose 20 minutes.  Maybe this is a rest, but somehow disgusting for the lost time.  It would be better to sing in chorus or wring out 20 times. <br><br>  I wish everyone to play, but do not flirt! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/12463/">https://habr.com/ru/post/12463/</a></p>
