  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tudulist for managers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There are a large number of systems of self-organization and task management.  I tried many of them, but I always faced the same problems: <br><ol><li>  <b>Irrelevant tasks in my tudulista</b> <br>  You decompose a volume problem into many, many subtasks, and then it turns out that this problem is solved much easier in a different way. <br>  Update tudulist after this unpleasant. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Unrecorded tasks</b> <br>  You do something in passing: for example, talking to a colleague over coffee, you accidentally solve many questions about your project. <br>  It is clear that this task will never fall into a tudulist. <br><br></li><li>  <b>There is no forest behind the trees</b> <br>  For a bunch of small tasks on the project you lose sight of its global goal, its diplomatic context.  After some time, it is difficult to prioritize strategic tasks (and therefore you are engaged in continuous workflow), interconnections between tasks are lost. </li></ol><br>  I fought with tudulista until I decided to change jobs, and I did not have to write a big document ‚ÄúTransfer of Affairs‚Äù for all my projects. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The document "Transfer of Affairs" was: <br><ul><li>  a list of all my projects; </li><li>  global tasks for each project (described in a way that is understandable to the new employee who comes after me); </li><li>  a brief description of what has been done; </li><li>  a detailed description of common tasks and problems that still need to be completed or solved; </li><li>  For some tasks or problems, the following steps are outlined in the todo list format (if they are already clear). </li></ul><br>  About two weeks before leaving the company, I lived on this document, updating it as work progresses.  And suddenly she noted that finally my projects became absolutely transparent, I don‚Äôt have to remember anything.  Everything important is recorded, goals and objectives are obvious.  Problems began to be solved instantly, and the tasks ceased to hang because the division into todo-tasks (one-way, which can sit-and-do) and strategic tasks (which sit-and-do cannot be done, but by which the following todo- task).

    <h4>  Practice </h4><br><br>  Turning to a new job and starting a new task, I decided to stick with the found format. <br><br>  I made a special notebook in <a href="http://evernote.com/">evernote</a> , and in it I got a separate note for each project.  The note begins with a plate of two columns. <br><ul><li>  The left column contains general, global goals, objectives and problems of this project. </li><li>  In the right column there are tasks that can be performed to get closer to the goal, to perform a global task, or to solve an existing problem.  In this column, it is important to keep exactly one-way "village-and-made" tasks. </li><li>  Under the tablet is a log of what was being done on this project.  For example, if in the corridor I came across a colleague Masha, and she blurted out some information about my task to me, then I fix this fact in the events on the project for the day. </li></ul><br><h4>  Organization of the working day </h4><br>  Now my working day is built like this. <br>  In the morning, the first thing I do is open a note with the current project, run through its global, strategic goals and objectives.  I critically think about whether something has changed, whether something new has become known globally. <br><br>  Then I run through the list of known to-do tasks, assess whether the status has changed for any of them (for example, if the task has been delegated, if the task has not been completed), or if new tasks have appeared.  Then I select tasks for today (not more than three). <br><br>  Then, under the tablet, I write the current date, write down the three selected tasks for today, go for coffee and proceed to their implementation. <br><br>  If during the day there are new tasks that are immediately executed, they are also recorded in the log of today.  If a new task cannot be immediately performed, then at first it is assessed for compliance with the overall global goals of the project.  If it complies with them, it will be recorded in the right column next to the corresponding global goal. <br><br><h4>  The investigation </h4><br>  The consequence of such a system was a rare clarity of the brain.  It turns out that in one place are stored goals, tudu tasks and a complete log of work on the project.  Thus, you can disconnect from the project at any time for an arbitrarily long time, without fear of forgetting something. <br>  Returning, quickly run through the recorded, and immediately turn to work. <br><br><h4>  About a beautiful future </h4><br>  By the way, the following quotation from <a href="http://prometa.livejournal.com/365171.html">the</a> LJ-user <a href="http://prometa.livejournal.com/">Prometa</a> <a href="http://prometa.livejournal.com/365171.html">post</a> is most suitable as a global task for the optimal self-organization system for me: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúRecently, I thought that some ideal life and planning would be one non-priority to-do list for everything.  Without division into urgent issues, problematic, protracted, domestic, creative - just one list from which you can do everything - everything will be important and useful for everything.  Not a single extra or optional item on which you can and do not spend time living.  And everything is equal, balanced, whether it is the head of research or the reorganization of bookshelves, a joint meal, the choice of a new dress, the reduction of financial plans.  To be engaged only in nonrandom and important, so that there is no place for division into the affairs of the first and second priority.
