As a result, everyone dances and sings again, the winning credits in the finale are all happy and happy, and weary, but infinitely happy heroes, to a romantic melody, dissolve into the sunset. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Everything is right almost that way.  Of course, there are certain nuances, they are generally worthy of attention, I don‚Äôt even want to mention ... but we will try to look at the body itself, without, so to speak, a hospital sheet.  To do this, you need to start from the beginning:

      <b>1. Ready-made boxed solution with modifications, development from scratch, or even try to save money and buy individual modules so that they can be screwed.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  It usually starts with this.  Heavy throwing - between the decision to buy everything at once in the developed complex with finishing to fit your needs and between the wide gesture of throwing headlong into the abyss of zero development.  Well, as a third option - nashakalit where the thread is ready-made modules to try to fasten them to the portal already developed by myself (from this I wrote in one of the articles) - this is my favorite part by the way :) <br><br>  <b>a)</b> Ready packaged solution. <br><br>  Do not flatter yourself, ready-made solutions for MS Sharepoint 2013 - does not happen, and can not be, by definition.  In the entire world market of the planet called "Earth" - this does not yet exist.  There are basic solutions that are really already prepared by the developer in a digestible form for implementation, but they simply cannot physically reflect all the nuances of your business.  Moreover, they are not designed for the final customer, but for the convenience of implementing the contractor itself, in order not to do the same work at the initial stages and not waste the customer‚Äôs time and money to write a news module for example or a telephone directory in hundredth time, well, of course for the customer to understand - how all this good will look in the end.  The module is created - tested, and put on the system with lightning speed, and then there is already a refinement of the nuances taking into account the specifics of the company and the possible application of a unique design. <br>  Why write basic bases for each customer from scratch - when you can apply and systematize ready-made modules and dramatically reduce the time for primary integration.  It is extremely profitable and convenient. <br>  This is essentially a ready-made boxed solution.  But it can never be ready for the needs of absolutely ANY company, and of course always minimal, but improvements are required.  Moreover, in relation to the finished modules - this can be either an additional 2-3% of the work, or 200-300% of the work from above.  Here it depends on the wishes of the customer. <br>  It is absolutely amazing to see when adult guys in costumes are sincerely and seriously surprised that it is precisely the specificity of their company that for some reason is not taken into account in the product. <br>  They say ay yay yay as bad.  I would like to say authoritatively - well, you can not initially take into account the requirements of all customers at once.  Some companies have an oil company, while others sell apples, and they all have different business processes and nuances, as well as methods and needs for voting, news, honor boards, employees and cards.  Here, for example, the news module - it is yes, it is suitable for everyone - there may be minimal improvements for a ready-made solution, and for example, the telephone directory policy, for all its completeness, cannot satisfy any interests without additional settings, since it is necessary to take into account the structure the company and its branch distribution and the number of departments and still knows what. <br><br>  <b>b) Development from scratch</b> <br><br>  Suppose the customer spat the developer in the face (with saliva, as they spat before historical imperialism) and blurted out that they didn‚Äôt need anything ready, they say, submit full customization. <br>  Fine.  No problem.  This is something that any contractor is waiting for, like, Professor Moriarty.  The price is greatly eroded by the sheer uncertainty of the outcome, respectively, it is extremely difficult to calculate and explain the price of a project in reality, which means we take as much money as we can carry.  Another question is that there are two pitfalls here: <br><br>  <b>Stone Namber van:</b> The customer of the fullness of the entire final picture that he wants to receive on the exhaust is not clear for himself (in most cases).  And if it is - it is extremely vague.  Something like the Spanish conquistador - who understands under the hood space that somewhere there is a golden Eldorado, and here exactly where - hell knows. <br><br>  Accordingly, this gives an unprecedented scope for calculating the total estimate in the most approximate and extremely favorable tones for the performer.  Here you can cram and unique design (the price by the way - without a ceiling), and a bunch of important, but completely unnecessary functionality and costs for baths, kickbacks, cafes and long-legged secretaries.  All this is of course only if the customer has a lot of small yellow circles in the wallet and the magic phrase ‚Äúdo the guys - the uncle pays how much you say‚Äù sounded in the air :)) <br><br>  <b>Stone Namber Tu:</b> The customer is in a state of moderate understanding of what he needs and even the Technical Assignment is present.  The technical task is always turbo.  If there is a TK - then everything goes like clockwork.  That's right - hop!  And like clockwork ... Often I pay attention - that the customer with the presence of those tasks in the callused hand is always more cheerful and liberated, rather than the one who does not have it.  So to say - good words and Colt can always do more than just a good word ..! <br>  The nuance is that if the task is available in full and detailed scope, and the project was not carried out - this always causes reasonable suspicions.  Where is it from? <br><br>  And who made it?  If the pros were schooled, then why didn‚Äôt they carry out the project, and if the writers simply TK, who led the project to write this technical task and where did this character go?  And in general, why is the TK separate from the project?  The topic is specific - it is not a dacha to build, when designers draw a plan - but builders build in accordance with this plan.  In the image of Sharik, everything is a little different - if the contractor can make a smart TK - on the development and implementation of a project based on MS Sharepoint 2013 - then at 99% - he should be able to put it into practice.  Every time - seeing the customer excellent TK - we ask ourselves, what moments could have prevented the contractor from interfering with the execution of the project in accordance with his own written plan.  When clarifying the circumstances, of course the extravaganza begins - basically it is a bunch of reciprocal reproaches, starting from the financial component (customers have squeezed money) and ending with screams that the performer is a fool.  Well, in general, it is clear that it is a dark matter. <br><br>  Development from scratch is money and time.  That's it.  Not only that - it's big money and big time.  No, of course it is clear that the contractor then standard modules and web parts (which he still has) will do on those engines that are already implemented, does it make sense to saw again the same thing?  And then the design will still be applied uniquely - we don‚Äôt forget about the magic phrase :) But the client doesn‚Äôt need to know that!  It is necessary from scratch - well, it will be from scratch.  Winners are not judged.  But the time that could slip through a couple of weeks - due to the official use of ready-made developments - will stretch a couple of extra months and add an extra zero to the sum of the final estimate. <br><br>  It goes without saying that really finalized improvements (that is, something that really requires serious development and implementation in the project) - will be implemented separately in blood and then, with additional gray hairs of the lead project and its main accomplices - technical engineers and progers, who have feathers on knightly helmets wilted, but wrestling spirit will not lose.  But this thing is understandable - it is not included in the box - it means there are no questions.  It is necessary to do additionally - it means it is necessary.  The final price tag for the development of modules supposedly "from scratch" and actually developed from the very beginning - will still be extremely favorable and three times higher than the finalization of the finished solution, and that means the sea, palm trees and convertibles - to everyone involved in the process from the developer - provided .  And the client on the exhaust gets a truly unique product - which is always a pleasure to present to the sauna business colleagues for songs of gypsies and dancing bears. <br><br>  <b>c) Save and buy individual modules</b> <br><br>  My another favorite part :) I love customers who scour the developers for what purpose the thread is almost free then, so it would work and be cheap. That is, a lot of meetings and presentations are appointed, cheeks are inflated, many impressive people are sitting in expensive suits - but what either sensible they are not ready to pay and are not going to.  It is about millions - and the thoughts initially about the amount of the order of thousands of orders for 50 rubles - no more.  And accordingly, first and foremost, it is the gentlemen of fortune - freelancing who are considered. <br>  Right freelance dream!  And the funny thing is that very often serious outsourced specialists are one of the best specialists in the world.  It is always a pleasure to work somewhere in Prague and to carry out orders as they arrive from the snowy Russia, especially when your favorite business warms the soul and pocket.  But why do they think that they are ready to sell their strength and experience for three kopecks?  This is where this came from?  Of course, we are talking about literacy and professionals.  But the customer of this type is extremely confident - that if freelancing means it will be very cheap, but better free! :) <br><br>  <i>It looks like this:</i> <br>  With the help of the customer‚Äôs IT specialists, a servachok is being installed.  MS Sharepoint Foundation is molded on top of it and SQL Express is screwed (well, that is, everything is more free).  Next, there are several sections in which processes flop at a primitive standard level.  Everything else is hammered by a powerful static (practically does not bear dynamic load) - that is, just a bunch of texts "about the company", "our departments", "employees", "documents", "news" and so on.  In general, it looks like more or less from the literary sites of the 90s, but with modern, irregularly cropped images at the edges, processed by the elusive local PR man.  Oppaaa - the portal is ready - we show the management.  The leadership usually sees this when grimacing in the style of Mrs. Marple, in principle, it approves for free, but you want that kind of creativity and whatever it would all like to work ...!  Accordingly, the idea is born that it is necessary to do some sort of customized lists and tie something functional to them.  And what should be done?  Right!  Exit found.  Buying a ready-made solution in the complex - expensive, zero development - this is wildness in general, hiring a team or specialist in the company staff - as it is vague in prospects, and your IT specialists will not tolerate such arbitrariness and can compete a competitor with corporate coffee, all that remains is to buy it immediately something that is cheaper, I mean a couple of modules - if only they would do at least something - if it can positively affect the favorable view of investors or owners.  I mean a bit and cheap! <br><br>  So buy the most simple and visually pleasing: News and birthdays of employees :)) Gip gip onwards!  So either find an office that zabakhaet and insert a couple of their ready-made modules, or fun but prudent freelancing - which will do the same, but at a more attractive price. <br><br>  Further developments are quite understandable and predictable.  5-6 meetings with developers from small to large were held, no one craves to implement something for fifty dollars (since you won‚Äôt get problems with such clients, and the exhaust is extremely dubious), and freelancers are ready to take it right now, but again on an advance payment , moreover, the larger the portfolio and, as a result, the experience, the less prepaid the advance payment.  Moreover, Microsoft developer-level outsourcers - especially from cities with the lovingly romantic name of Prague, Munich, Limassol, London, etc.  - simply refuse to understand the amount of prepayments of less than a thousand euros.  I am silent about Ukraine and Belarus - they generally know the price for themselves (which is by the way right) and similar offers are accepted only for a serious advance payment, moreover, projects are not taken below a certain amount.  By the way, they honestly talk about their employment and calendar performance. <br>  In general, we have what we have - the client is rushing, doing something necessary, the authorities are scolding (besides, all this violence is exposed both to management and potential contractors, as a finished project that has been completely completed on its own, there are literally a couple of points to do ... right now then for 15 minutes). <br><br>  Okay - let's go further. <br><br>  <b>2. The choice of implementer - contractor.</b> <br><br>  A fairly widespread opinion is that we open a search engine - we enter a request and immediately there will be a hundred companies in the list that will do everything right now.  That is, right now and right here they will.  By the way, in the literal sense, it is STO companies that can perform a similar front of work. A guy is a piece-specific and highly specific job.  Well, how to build a house or a car to collect.  That is, there are many declared offices in the search engine, but really fighting ones - as always, on the strength of pieces 9-10.  Moreover, throughout Russia.  For example, building materials are sold by many, but few can provide the whole range of services for building a cozy mansion in the suburbs. <br>  Accordingly, there is exactly the same. <br>  There are large integrators - there are medium-sized ones, but small ones simply do not exist.  For one simple reason - small offices simply do not have the resources to implement it or they do projects so that they are difficult to consider in the general statistics.  If there is a mention of the word ‚ÄúSharepoint‚Äù on the company's website, this does not mean that they really can do something in this area. <br>  It is ugly easy to check a potential contractor‚Äôs company for competence ‚Äî simply enough (even without visual negotiations) ‚Äîto demand in the ultimatum tone ‚Äî access to the demo version.  If demo access is given, then the company moves to the second round of selection, but if in response there are excuses like: <br><br>  - the technical specialist fell ill <br>  - ill manager <br>  - the Internet channel is covered <br>  - the server is currently being transferred to another site <br>  - the ball is being moved now, therefore there is no access temporarily <br>  - Windows server is rearranged too <br>  - the cleaner brushed up the cable <br>  - a dragon flew into the windows and devoured the teller <br>  - they promise to send access, but they do not send it, because ... well, just like that, that's all, but by voice over the phone they are very actively communicating. <br><br>  etc. <br><br>  Forget it.  And never remember.  Since there are only two possible types of companies that can be performers in the project: <br><br>  <b>a)</b> Very large integrators are included in the top IT companies of the Russian Federation (the price tag is appropriate), of course, with the availability of the MS Sharepoint-based development department, since it may not be and they will also, quite calmly, simply attract someone more professional in the narrow specifics of project implementation.  This will of course be unknown to the customer, but will be included in the final price :) <br><br>  <b>b)</b> Medium-sized companies that coordinate upon your request immediately send access to their demo version or make a presentation thereof at a meeting.  It is easy (literally in five minutes) - confirms the degree of competence of the contractor.  And you can score diplomas and certificates, because they are recruited at the expense of completely different means and do not affect the level of specific personalities of the developers leading your project. <br><br>  <b>3</b>  <b>Number of employees performing the project</b> <br><br>  Usually one of the first questions - how many employees in your company - will work on my project?  The standard answer is yes everything is there :) <br>  I don‚Äôt know what to say here.  In general, the splitting into categories of projects is approximately the following: <br><br>  1 technician + 1 project leader - in case the complexity and cost of the project in the area is up to 800 thousand rubles <br>  2 technicians + 1 project leader - in case the complexity and cost of the project is in the region from 800 to 2.5 million rubles <br>  3 technicians + 1 project leader - if the complexity and cost of the project is in the area from 2.5 to 5 million rubles <br>  4 technicians +1/2 leading project - if higher, but again in complexity. <br><br>  Everything else - by very strong agreement, regardless of the size and level of the company.  (Size does not affect the level) <br><br>  Of course it is clear that the whole company and the entire staff work on a separate project.  That is, printer paper carriers, secretaries, couriers, various <br><br>  managers of all types, and consultants of all that is possible, as well as analysts of everything and everyone.  That is, the characters of the sea.    .      ‚Äî       ‚Äî    5-6   .   ‚Äî         2-3    .      .
