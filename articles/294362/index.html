In a month, we made 2500 registrations and made an operating profit.  How we did read the article. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I decided to write the article yesterday, opening wordstat and seeing how many people are looking for our service.  When I saw, it seemed to me very little, but these are the results for the month. <br><br>  After comparing the indicators with other callback services, I realized that in principle we began to look for us in a month more than those who are more than six months on the market.

If you look at the dynamics of CallbackHunter, they had 110 requests in the first month <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b24/801/dd5/b24801dd57154f2696f39dd9eca43c8d.jpg"><br><br><h4>  The decision to create a service </h4><br>  On June 25, in our group on the business of VKontakte, I voted on whether they needed a callback service for calls from any form on the site (initially it was planned as the main advantage and UTP) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/583/d04/497/583d0449796343a4b02a2aa6c9ccf57a.jpg"><br><br>  Voting obviously showed that such a service was needed by our audience.  So, on June 25, 2015, product development was launched.  No name yet.  Initially, the idea was to make a product that will call from all forms on the site.  Said and done, that day the development of the service began. <br><br>  Immediately the requirements were set: <br><br><ul><li>  Service should be very simple; </li><li>  Service should be as described as possible.  Each element must contain a certificate to reduce the number of calls; </li><li>  The service should be as automated as possible.  What would it serve a minimum of people; </li><li>  We do service without external investments.  Only the resources of three people.  Me, Igor - development guru and Diana - sales wizard. </li></ul><br>  All these requirements are derived from previous experience in developing and promoting services.  Previously, I wanted to have a big team, which I achieved and there were times when 150 people worked in the company, now there are about 110. <br><br>  But now I wanted to make the service as automated as possible and as autonomous as possible.  What service would do as few people as possible. <br><br>  During development, it was decided that a single function of the call from the forms would not be enough, and the subscribers of the group began to ask if there would be a button.  It was decided to make a full service callback one of the functions of which will be a call from any form on the site. <br><br>  We decided to chop cabbage from people for each lead as much as 50 rubles.  But after the start they decided to revise it, but more on that later. <br><br><h4>  Development </h4><br>  Month of development is sleepless nights, dozens of hours of discussions, choice of technologies and hard work. <br><br>  Since it was decided to make the service as automated as possible, it was decided to make the main sales through transactional letters. <br><br>  Prior to this, there was experience only with GetResponse, and we perverted by making a transactional mailing through it.  Necessary mails were transferred from campaign to campaign, and autoresponders were sent to the campaigns, who sent letters. <br><br>  It‚Äôs good that our account was blocked because if you don‚Äôt send mail to the API when sending a letter, then the email goes to the entire database.  If this had happened after the launch for us it would have been a disaster of a huge scale. <br><br>  Then we found the mandrillapp and started sending letters through it. <br><br>  In total, in our transactional mailing, which sells about 50 different letters for different scenarios on the machine.  All letters come personally from one of the team members who is responsible for the service site about which the letter is sent. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/124/6ee/a51/1246eea5193d4b32a2164b2b5ee9bb8a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/67e/5a3/191/67e5a3191884464f9f4e32c2c1fe1051.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7da/939/6e8/7da9396e82ad4b69b2a9fcf0852cf01a.jpg"><br><br>  Letters with information about calls and reports come from our staff postman - robot Vasya <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e5/f28/b5c/7e5f28b5cec947e7b8702689cf5a36c8.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Launch </h4><br>  Somewhere from 26-27 we started the service in testing.  They put the cost of the lead 50 rubles without a call time limit.  We decided to sell through cold calls.  We made the first installation, received the first payment.  But for some reason there was no joy. <br><br>  And there was no joy because we did not differ from anyone in the market and it killed.  I wanted to build up from everyone and we began to look around ... <br><br><h4>  Uniqueness </h4><br>  On Friday, July 31, having worked for a week, we sat down and took hold of our heads.  Hooked into the office hookah.  From hookah smoke dizzy.  The kettle did not have time to boil.  A cup of a cup of tea and coffee were sent to our stomachs. <br><br>  Of course, I wanted to earn fast.  But we overpowered ourselves and decided.  Let's make a service in which there will be a minimum of costs, and first of all employees and we will set the lowest possible price. <br><br>  We abandon the model that is accepted on the market and turn it upside down.  Leave a minute without extra charge, and we will take payment for the service.  And make two versions that differ in functionality.  Free can be used as much as you want, paying only for minutes of conversation.  Paid will give advanced functionality for only 750 rubles per month.  The cost of a minute of conversation is 4 rubles. <br><br><h4>  Recycling model </h4><br>  For technical processing model took 2 days Saturday and Sunday.  Work has begun to boil.  I had to rewrite a lot of code, a lot of letters, completely redo the landing page. <br><br><h4>  Restart </h4><br>  On Monday, August 3, 2015, we started.  It was necessary to bring the first wave of users who would pull up the next ones, someone would become partners and start bringing customers. <br><br>  It was decided to attract the first users from the mailing list on my base.  I conducted many webinars, distributed my free courses in exchange for mail, so the base was assembled.  We loaded this database into the service of Pechkin Meil, many thanks to them and made a newsletter. <br><br>  Registrations rained down.  I sat and every minute pressed the F5 button updating statistics.  This is a fabulous feeling.  I have seen numbers grow many times when managers sell.  But then the numbers grew in a system that developed itself. <br><br><h4>  First day </h4><br>  And so for the first day we made about 500 registrations.  The main driver of growth was the recommendation system, which we laid from the very beginning and the high virality of the service. <br><br>  We offer to make a repost on your VKontakte page in exchange for replenishing the balance by 20 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f6/7c6/f06/0f67c6f061a14b61a5fc45776b685728.jpg"><br><br>  Quite a lot of people use this feature. <br><br>  It is important that repost texts are marked up with hashtags, which allows you to choose some more traffic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/583/d04/497/583d0449796343a4b02a2aa6c9ccf57a.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Affiliate Program Development </h4><br>  I saw a great development potential in the affiliate program.  Since we do not earn money on minutes of conversation, it was decided that we would pay the partner 200 rubles for active registration out of our own pocket and 32% for life from all payments for the service. <br><br>  The uniqueness of our affiliate program is that when a client puts a widget on his website, the affiliate link of the person who brought him is hung up in his widget <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e42/f8b/e37/e42f8be37d3c47be9bb1adaabbadd973.jpg"><br><br>  Sites are visited daily by people including entrepreneurs.  Someone wants to install the same widget on your site.  Follows the link and puts an affiliate link on its website in the widget.  Schematically, the affiliate program can be represented as a diagram <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7bd/c31/de1/7bdc31de1bd24dc29bab2d1c0cb60f39.png"><br><br>  Those.  in fact, it is enough to install the widget on 10-20 sites and start getting new customers to your network on the machine. <br><br>  During our work statistics has been revealed that 10,000 visits to client sites give 1 registration.  It turns out that having 20 sites with a attendance of 500 people the network will grow daily on 1 site. <br><br>  Then it was necessary to partner with other market players with a similar target audience. <br><br><h4>  WIN-WIN partnership </h4><br>  The first with whom we started were LPTrend - the designer of landing pages.  Did the newsletter on their base.  Received about 250 registrations. <br><br>  Our next killer partner was a professional platform for creating an online store InSales.  We have placed our application in their market place.  While the InSales have not distributed the newsletter, only those who find it in the store are registered.  About 30 registrations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cfd/bc4/cf5/cfdbc4cf504948a7b008c563b9e39337.jpg"><br><br>  Then we started with a convenient component for an online store for Jommla Xenmart, also integrating into their component. <br><br>  Then start with the designer of landing pages LPmotor.  Work is currently underway on technical integration.  According to the results I can not unsubscribe.  Until the end of September will be implemented. <br><br>  Now I am negotiating with setup.ru and nethouse.  Just thinking how to make a component for WIX <br><br><h4>  Content marketing </h4><br>  Good results were obtained by placing articles on Spark and Megamind.  In general, probably 400 registrations arrived from these services for the month. <br><br><h4>  Paid traffic </h4><br>  Also for the test paid paid advertising in Yandex Direct and VKontakte.  Of course, it‚Äôs not necessary to talk about objectivity at this level, but our task is to generate money without investments and only what is earned in CallbackKILLER will be reinvested. <br><br><h5>  In contact with </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d7c/6fc/18a/d7c6fc18a68b4d05898c41535b51c799.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce7/9a1/2cd/ce79a12cd88249f8a8d2919009889c2e.jpg"><br><br>  <b><i>Registration cost was 30 rubles 62 kopecks.</i></b> <br><br><h5>  Yandex Direct </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/241/063/bac/241063bac96b46db8bdd081decfafc6d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b85/101/a75/b85101a752ab4b7cab82f5ab334e4028.jpg"><br><br>  We ourselves do not climb into these areas.  We give to partners - let them earn.  It is very important for us that the partners feel comfortable and can earn with us. <br><br><h4>  Numbers </h4><br>  This is all the lyrics, I think it will be much more interesting to hear about numbers, conversions and money. <br><br>  Registrations - 2587 users <br><br>  Set the code - 30.69% - 794 users (not the site) <br><br>  Pay for communication - 19.71% - 510 users <br><br>  Pay for service - 5.8% - 150 users <br><br>  Total we received 150 paying users per month.  This is 127,500 rubles.  Why the figure is more than 150 * 750, because 150 is the number of users, and they pay for 170 sites. <br><br>  Today we launched a service in Ukraine at a price of 2.5 hryvnia per minute. <br><br>  We are preparing the launch of the service in Kazakhstan and Belarus.  The launch of other countries takes time, as we connect local IP telephony operators to keep the price as low as possible according to our strategy. <br><br>  Always free <a href="http://callbackkiller.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmmozg-first-blood">CallbackKILLER</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294362/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294362/</a></p>
