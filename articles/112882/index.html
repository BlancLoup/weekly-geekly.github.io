Actually, the main claims to the current Nokia 3 smartphones: <br><ul><li>  Rejection of the production of tubes on the android. </li><li>  the late transition to the touch-interface and multi-touch, slow development of software in general and the hardware of the "previous generation". </li><li>  Curvature of desktop software and services ¬´OVI¬ª, which, moreover, is not available either under Mac or Linux. </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  All three points are very closely related to each other, it is difficult to argue with them.  During 2008-2009, the situation was exactly this, but <b>I want to convey to you my idea that Nokia is actively working to correct them</b> .  I intentionally will not touch on the topic of MeeGo, because I did not have anything to do with it. <br><br>  1. <b>Refusal to produce pipes on the android.</b> <br>  There is little that can be said, except to recall the past merits of Nokia in the production of ‚Äúsmartphones for people‚Äù and let the giant decide for itself.  In the end, do we need another manufacturer of Android phones?  Maybe Nokia simply cannot release a good product here, but does not want to release a bad one?  After all, on the iron component, phones from Nokia only now begin to pull up to the lower bar of normal androids, and they are far from ‚Äúgood‚Äù stuffing (for example, 1 GHz, 512 Ram, Tegra 2).  So is it worth blaming Nokia for the fact that it may simply not have the right suppliers and production facilities?  On Windows Mobile, she didn‚Äôt bother herself at the same time - this is not her production segment.

      2. and 3. <b>Touch interface, old OS and old hardware, terrible web services.</b> <br>  In early 2010, I lost with 5800, and also helped a friend set up the Nokia N97 (he did not wait for the Moto Droida to come to us) and was horrified.  Almost everything was bad.  OVI suite just killed me after a well-developed and stable PC suite.  But summer came, I was faced with the need to change my old <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/asus_p750-2170.php">ASUS P-750</a> under Windows mobile 6.5.  The phone was taken under the second number, Internet 3G (Utel) and the GPS with the cradle in the car was very necessary.  I took the <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_5800_navigation_edition-2906.php">5800 Navigation Edition</a> , mainly for the cards of Nokia, which just recently got free navigation, and the native cradle in the kit.  And I was very pleasantly surprised.  The latest firmware was surprisingly quick, smooth and stable.  Compared with the beginning of the year - the earth and sky.  Cradle, by the way, also pleased - very thoughtfully done.  Following the results of 6 months of use - I am still very pleased with the phone.  For 250 CU, which I gave for him, this is a miracle machine.  Most importantly, I repeat, I was struck by the evolution of the firmware.  True, the services and software OVI still caused a gagging urge. <br>  Half a year has passed, I decided to change my E66 Nokia.  In my opinion, this is generally the best non-touchscreen smartphone ever, it works fine, but the charging plug loosened up and sometimes began to move away.  After revising all possible androids, I accidentally stumbled upon <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_c6_01-3524.php">Nokia C6-01</a> , and in its price category (375 U.E.) it remained out of competition.  Even though I have been promising myself a year to go, finally, to an android, I still took this device - it really hurts.  After testing it, again I was amazed at the development of Nokia.  It‚Äôs not that I didn‚Äôt see this in Android or iOS, but I didn‚Äôt expect such progress from Nokia. <br>  In addition to the excellent assembly - the body of black steel and glass "Gorilla Glass" (as on the IPhone), filling and magnificent capacitive screen, the operating system again made a leap forward.  I have something to compare with - a gift from a girl who was once mine, an iPhone 1g with iOS 3, a friend‚Äôs iPhone 4g and a brother‚Äôs iPad + a bunch of different Androids.  What can I say, Symbian ^ 3 almost caught up with them.  There are interface flaws here and there, but they are few, and remain less and less with each new firmware.  Many applications are lagging behind in the implementation of multitouch, but they also pull up.  The Birds are great :-), downloaded from the native ‚ÄúOVI‚Äù upstor. <br>  By the way, about OVI.  I scored on the software update for half a year, and avoided services like a fire, but under the new phone I climbed the Software update tab.  And again, a pleasant surprise, a new, very user-friendly interface (sketched from iTunes), stability is better by several orders of magnitude and online services that are already pleasant to use.  Yes, the OVI store on the phone itself sometimes says that it cannot launch the application after installing it, but this is treated by launching through the general menu. <br>  As for the versions for Linux and Mac, I think, here again the philosophy of Nokia, ‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt port the raw product, first we‚Äôll bring it to Windows, then we‚Äôll port it normally‚Äù.  I hope not to wait long. <br><br>  Why did I write all this?  <b>I believe that Symbian OS under the wing of Nokia over the past year has developed no less than Android or iOS, it does not bend at all and it has a place in the future.</b> <br>  And yet, one should not expect much from Nokia‚Äôs ‚Äúflagships‚Äù - it somehow didn‚Äôt work out for her, N97, N8 is an example.  The real treasures of Nokia releases in the segment 150-400 CU.  I would like to gratefully recall <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_n70-1153.php">N70</a> , <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_e50-1566.php">E50</a> , <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_e66-2426.php">E66</a> (all of them, by the way, serve the new owners until now, even the E66 stopped losing the charger), and wish Nokii, first of all, to quickly update the browser under Symbian ^ 3 to the level of the leading market players ( although the Opera Mini 5.1 + Mobile 10.1 bundle still works quite well). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112882/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112882/</a></p>
