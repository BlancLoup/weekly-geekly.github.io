  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The future of the online media industry: through the prism of trends 2014-2015</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The topic of choosing the direction of media development has always been at its peak: ‚Äúwhere to go and how to survive‚Äù is the fashion trend of the last decades of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV.  Here is one of the numerous expert opinions - Denis Maximov, Managing Director of OMD MD |  PHD Group: <a href="http://adindex.ru/publication/opinion/media/2015/02/4/120073.phtml">‚ÄúPublishers must turn back to paper</a> . <a href="http://adindex.ru/publication/opinion/media/2015/02/4/120073.phtml">‚Äù</a>  The author cites data on a 10% fall in the advertising revenue market and calls on his colleagues: ‚ÄúPublishers need to turn back to paper ... It‚Äôs impossible to say indiscriminately that publishers have paid less attention to content, but most of our publishers have stopped anticipating changing consumer demands.‚Äù <br><br>  In early February, an interesting <a href="http://kazanfirst.ru/feed/39013">public discussion</a> took place <a href="http://kazanfirst.ru/feed/39013">among several leaders of the media industry</a> , in which they shared their views: Daniel Trabun, editor-in-chief of the Afisha magazine, Mark Shein, Lentach community manager, and Pavel Pryanikov, deputy editor-in-chief of Lenta.ru. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The discussion took place after the publication of a large study ‚ÄúMedia Citation Rating in 2014 and Development Forecasts‚Äù of the Brand Analytics analytical center, the full text of which is available at <a href="https://br-analytics.ru/blog/rejting-citiruemosti-rossijskix-smi-4/">br-analytics.ru/blog/rejting-citiruemosti-rossijskix-smi-4</a> . <br><br>  Naturally, when publishing any research, it is difficult, and sometimes impossible, to present to readers and experts a collection of all the data - you need to choose one or two main ideas and focus only on them.

      This supplement to the study focuses on the formation of a "new type of media" - the new Mass Information Systems - which formally do not fall, for whatever reason, under the "Procrustean bed" of the term "Russian Means of MI", but being symbolic, recognizable and authoritative resources for millions of readers and commentators. <br><br>  What will be called the ‚Äúnew type of media‚Äù, which does not fall under already familiar media concepts, blogs, aggregators, experts still do not know, maybe someone of the readers will be able to come up with a succinct and precise term, like IoT, that stirred up the Internet industry - ‚ÄúInternet of Things‚Äù. <br><br>  Also, the media industry will have to expand the gradation and boundaries for the new direction, it is already clear that the new media have a radically new level of interaction with readers and a very significant amount of user content (User Generation Content).  The active use and attraction of UGC is first spotted, and now massively used in the most ‚Äúmobile‚Äù segment of traditional media ‚Äî in television: Life News, P24, Pepper, and others. The channels have entire programs formed from video users in the broadcasting network. <br><br>  For a comparative analysis, below are the top media from the already mentioned study, "The citation rating of the Russian media," as well as leaders from the <a href="https://br-analytics.ru/blog/rejtingi-citiruemosti-russkoyazychnyx-blogov-i-tematicheskix-internet-resursov-za-yanvar-2015/">"Citing rating of Russian-language bloggers</a> . <a href="https://br-analytics.ru/blog/rejtingi-citiruemosti-russkoyazychnyx-blogov-i-tematicheskix-internet-resursov-za-yanvar-2015/">"</a> <br><br>  <b>Top media citation rating in social media (January 2015):</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7aa/ebd/25c/7aaebd25c3684704b85c472194ffcdd3.png"><br><br>  <b>Top social media citation rating (January 2015):</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/424/fd2/70d/424fd270d9294f958076ed0393728a93.png"><br><br><h2>  The citation rate of information resources of a new type in social media (January 2015) </h2><br>  Below are data on the top 10 Russian-language (not necessarily Russian, not necessarily media, non-blog of a specific person) information resources, links to which are actively used in communication by users of Russian social networks and blog-platforms, commentators of news and information materials: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d9d/550/57d/d9d55057d3314bf989ce87c33428f090.png"><br><br>  As can be seen from the above data, Rusvesna.su, Meduza.io and Ridus.ru perfectly compete with Life News, TASS and Vedomosti.  Thematic resources Babyblog.ru, Habrhabr.ru and TJournal.ru, as well as ‚Äúsituational‚Äù and ‚Äúsocium‚Äù blogs - ColonelCassad, Navalny.com, NStarikov.ru - are referenced no less than thematic publications such as Ukraina.ru (23,615 references) or to the materials of InoSMI (inosmi.ru) - 32,272 references. <br><br><h2>  findings </h2><br>  The industry of content resources on the Internet is constantly on the move: over the past year, popular bloggers have become the media, and some print media have "lost" paper versions or switched to digest almanacs, shifting the focus to the Internet versions. <br><br>  Numerous aggregator sites are rapidly developing, but only a few of them have been able to aggregate not only news from other source sites, but also, more importantly, an active audience of readers, commenting and discussing materials of publications, using links to articles as arguments and factography. in social media discussions. <br><br>  It is those online publications, regardless of format and jurisdiction, that can: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>attract an active audience of</b> readers, writers, commentators; </li><li>  show interest in sharing information, the <b>ability to hear and listen to people</b> ; </li><li>  <b>to form an expert community</b> in a specific region, area of ‚Äã‚Äãinterest, subject matter, ensure success for the coming years. </li></ul><br><br>  PS As a free advice: in many editions there is already a position that can be interpreted as a ‚Äúcommunity manager‚Äù or ‚Äúcommunity manager‚Äù.  It makes sense to consider the option of inviting people from the gaming industry to such vacancies who have been successfully engaged in ‚Äúmanaging‚Äù large audiences for years - hundreds of thousands of residents of ‚Äúvirtual universes‚Äù, and in fact - real people in all their diversity of interests and opinions. <br><br>  It‚Äôs hard to figure out where to get more experience: by the way, a professor-expert on game currencies in popular multiplayer games has been invited to the post of Minister of Finance in the new Greek government: he was lucky to conduct more <b>successful</b> financial experiments than the heads of the Central Bank of developed countries put together. <br><br><hr><br>  For the calculation of ratings for January, nearly <b>800 million messages from 35 million authors</b> published in social media for the period from January 1 to January 31, 2015 were processed.  Data sources for analyzing messages were popular social networks and services: VKontakte, Twitter, Odnoklassniki, My World, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, G +, as well as blogs, forums, news articles and commentaries to them, thematic sites and discussion groups. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/284058/">https://habr.com/ru/post/284058/</a></p>
