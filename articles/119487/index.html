In this issue we present you two Sergeyev - Burkova and Nedoroslev. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Sergey Burkov, Mentor 500 Startups, member of the advisory board of the Skolkovo Foundation and the Russian Venture Company.</b>  Sergey was the first director of the Moscow development center of Google, where he led the development of products and technology for both the Russian and global markets.  In less than 2 years, Google Russia has significantly improved the quality of Russian-language search, launched more than a dozen products, tripled traffic and increased its share of the Russian web search market from 10% to 27%.  Sergey also led the integration and further development of technology, which grew out of Google‚Äôs acquisition of start-up company Dulance, Inc., which he had previously founded.  The result of this effort was a search engine of new-generation products, able to find any product that is sold on the Internet.  With the help of artificial intelligence technologies, the search engine retrieves the names of goods, prices and images directly from the pages of online stores.  This approach allows you to cover almost all small and specialty stores around the world that sell any, even the rarest of goods.  (The search for products for Russia, Google Shopping, is based on this terminology.).  Before joining Google, Sergey founded and led three startups.  The aforementioned Dulance, a search engine for new-generation goods, was bought by Google.  Invincible Data Systems was one of the first companies in the world to develop transparent disk encryption and e-mail (it was acquired by VASCO Data Security).  Bilbo Innovations, Inc.  Invented and produced pedals for the computer ‚ÄúSTEP ON IT!‚Äù.
