According to the agreement signed between Infin and Mars One shareholders, 100% of One Ventures PLC is transferred to Infin for ‚Ç¨ 87 million. In the future, 97.5% of the project‚Äôs shares will be offered for sale on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúMars One is very pleased with the Infin acquisition.  This step gives us the opportunity to raise capital through the sale of securities on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.  This step also coincides with our goal in attracting international support to create a permanent settlement of people on Mars: our followers around the world will have the opportunity to be part of this adventure and literally ‚Äúget a piece‚Äù of this historic event.  We have a solid business that may be of interest to those who are looking for opportunities to diversify their investment portfolio, ‚Äùsaid Bas Lansdorp, CEO and co-founder of Mars One.

      In the light of recent events, the sale of Mars One to another company with the subsequent sale of securities is another attempt to find funding for a controversial project. <br><br>  Previously, the Mars One project management made a number of loud statements that did not correspond to reality.  In 2013, the project authors <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/205586/">launched a</a> crowdfunding fundraising campaign <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/mars-one-first-private-mars-mission-in-2018">on the indiegogo site</a> , within which $ <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/mars-one-first-private-mars-mission-in-2018">313,744</a> out of a stated $ 400,000 was raised. <br><br>  Huge questions were caused by the financing of the project, because the figure of $ 400 thousand for a space launch is insignificant.  The authors of Mars One tried to get out through the promise to turn the flight and life of the colony into a reality show broadcast on TV, but no agreement was reached by the end of 2015, and that date was called the last date.  At the same time, Mars One <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/261954/">requested $ 15 million</a> from investors for additional research. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/16a/ad5/380/16aad53808074c3db1186377ceab6eec.png"><br>  <em>Comparing the cost of the Apollo program and the declared value of Mars One</em> <br><br>  Then, in 2015, the project was shaken by a number of scandals, including the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/247576/">exposure of the company's management by Joseph Roche</a> , who was an employee of Mars One.  According to Joseph, the company‚Äôs management was actually ‚Äúpumping out money‚Äù from the hype around the project.  Problems with the project also arose after the fact of overstatement of the number of people willing to participate in the program was revealed. <br><br>  Perhaps the leadership of Mars One will be able to raise funds.  But now they have a serious competitor in the person of Ilona Musk with his Martian program.  And, unlike Mars One, the founder of Tesla Motors and SpaceX has its own aerospace company, rockets that successfully fly, technologies and production facilities in the field of energy and batteries, without which colonization of Mars is impossible, and investor confidence. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399093/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399093/</a></p>
