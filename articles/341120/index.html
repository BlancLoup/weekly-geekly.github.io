Another year of your life in anticipation of the promised career and professional growth, shares, options and full financial independence.  Oops!  One more!  Congratulations, you are in a stale project. <br><br>  How did you get here?  Chose a short track curve with a young promising dream team and a mega-interesting innovative challenge?  You just need to be brave, bold, skillful, and here he is, successful success sticks out of all the cracks.  Young millionaires are already waiting for you in their club. <br><br>  Or maybe you chose a reliable federal career path in the world famous IT giant, ready to learn and grow from junior to leading specialist?  Go for a long time, but you will reach for sure.

      Each option is good in its own way: on a curved path, you can get stuck crookedly, and on the federal highway - federal.  Now tell you how. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x1/zl/9-/x1zl9-zr5hib0go62g9qvyl0reg.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Mega-interesting project </h3><br>  We will do a mega-interesting project, we need cool developers, but we will not think about salary and sales!  Is the project interesting?  Interesting!  Well, it means that everyone will line up at the checkout.  Is logical <br><br>  And all of a sudden, at some point the money runs out.  And, it seems, it is necessary to say that thanks to all, everyone is free.  However, in this situation, the management behaves mega-interesting: ‚ÄúGuys, we are about to find money!‚Äù Or ‚ÄúWe are about to buy - wait a bit!‚Äù Or ‚ÄúRejoice!  We are interested in the King of the World!  We need to sit for a couple of nights and urgently fasten a non-network / VR / blockchain here (substitute the necessary one from Google Trends) ‚Äù.  And so the years pass. <br><br>  <b>My advice:</b> <br><br>  Search for a new, even more mega-interesting project at the first salary delay.  I understand that lovers are interesting, like drug addicts, which means that you just need to change from one substance to another in time. <br><br><h3>  Mega-interesting project, but full of money! </h3><br>  It would seem that last time everything came up against low-lying money.  But now it's 100% sure: you have found an oligarch who is ready to bash you like with a machine gun.  And at the end of each meeting, he assures: ‚ÄúThere is money!‚Äù.  If you tell him that it is unreal unreal, and he does not have enough money, then he perceives it as a personal offense and starts screaming: ‚ÄúI will never run out of money!‚Äù So ‚Äã‚Äãyou cheerfully tuck one chip, then at least cheerfully tuck one more thing, and still a lot of money.  Then they tell you that you can‚Äôt cope and that you hire ten more people to help you.  And then the money still runs out. <br><br>  <b>The advice is the same:</b> <br><br>  At the first sign of saving ... Oh, sorry!  Of course, optimization! ... we are looking for a new interesting project.  Who will be the last - that and water.  Those.  he will go to the forest to negotiate with the investors for the next round. <br><br><h3>  Mega-interesting project, but the money is full and they still do not end </h3><br>  So, you already have a lot of assistants, you work in a team of the coolest specialists you have ever seen, you screw one chip, another, a third ... Yes, a hundred chips!  They climb like a zombie during the apocalypse ... You are not in the ‚ÄúSberbank‚Äù case? <br><br>  Oh, there are so many chips that you no longer understand which team is cutting, and why they are needed.  You are stuck in a crazy functionality, and time is over, and the project is rapidly losing relevance. <br><br>  <b>Tip:</b> <br><br>  Do you know what will happen next?  Probably, optimizers will come to you soon.  Here you need to answer yourself the question of how you are tied to this mega-interesting project, how nice you are to receive these good money, and how ready you are for anal optimization. <br><br>  And by the way, you may not answer yourself this question, but rather go further downstream towards rectal optimizers.  Most likely, at the first acquaintance with sounding this answer will come to your mind itself. <br><br><h3>  Mega-interesting project, but the money is full and they do not run out of time, too, as you want </h3><br>  Then a colleague asks me: ‚ÄúHow is that?  How is it possible that money and time do not run out! ‚ÄùAnd very simple.  This means that the project is so uber-interesting that you are paid very little and you are on state funding.  Congratulations, you are rotting in a scientific research institute or in another state structure!  Your laboratory got stuck, the department got stuck, the whole scientific research institute got stuck. <br><br>  <b>Tip:</b> <br><br>  I have bad predictions.  I'm not sure that anal optimizers will have time to come to you before you get old, research institutes and government agencies have a very high degree of viscosity, in which optimizers themselves often get stuck. <br><br>  If you are a progressive scientist and do not want to rot, then you are constantly looking for a laboratory or a department, and maybe also a scientific research institute where you still haven't had time to completely get stuck.  If you do not get scientific articles regularly, then you either need to quit, or look for a stronger team in which something is moving. <br><br><h3>  Mega-interesting project, but the money is full and they don‚Äôt run out of time as much as you want, but not scientific research institutes and not a government </h3><br>  Think I slipped into insanity?  By no means!  This option is so trivial that it is even difficult to think about it.  And all is banal: we walk on our own.  This is your own mega-interesting project.  Money and time do not run out while you are alive, and there is no top management and bureaucracy above you that hinder your work.  So what is wrong ?!  Yes, just two things: one thing after another.  And, behold, you are no longer a programmer, but an accountant / supply manager / caliper and floors here in the evenings you sweep. <br><br><h3>  findings </h3><br>  Summarizing the experience gained, I dare to say: get stuck - wali.  Apparently, during the fixing process, some special hormones are produced in the brain, which only pull to the bottom.  Moreover, it is worth to blame both ordinary employees and managers, and even the founders.  Believe all this will be better, but that's another story. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/341120/">https://habr.com/ru/post/341120/</a></p>
