In everyday life there are both common terms understood by the IT community, and purely fancore.  On the eve of the New Year, we decided to get a little confused and put all the terms and expressions together.  The result was a small non-dal dictionary. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Amnesty</b> - the task to unban all users. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  - On February 29, we send a letter about amnesty.

      <b>Java boyars</b> are developers using Java.  Can be used with any respected programming language, but not suitable for PHP and JavaScript. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  - Java boyars, how to add an HTTP request header to the context of a logback? <br><br>  <b>Unloading to Zeplin</b> means our work is over here. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  - Unload layouts to Zeplin. <br><br>  <b>Move buttons</b> - be a UX / UI designer. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  - What do you do at work? <br>  - I move the buttons. <br><br>  <b>Detox</b> - feature to reduce the toxicity of content and comments. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  - In the detox branch, a new task appeared. <br><br>  <b>Stuck build</b> - Russification team Build -&gt; Clean Project. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  - After the change of branches, my build is not going to. <br>  - Stick him up. <br><br>  <b>Throw in rezolv</b> .  <b>Rezolv</b> - Worklflow.  When the task is ready, we throw it into rezolv. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  - Throw in rezolv. <br><br>  <b>Deadly conflict</b> - the conflict of merging edits from different branches in the same place. <br><br>  <i>Example of use</i> : when the control system cannot decide how to apply the changes, you have to throw up your hands and vaguely exclaim: ‚ÄúWhat the fuck is this, Sergey?‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Chandelier</b> - Adobe Illustrator. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  - I do in the chandelier. <br><br>  <b>Manifesto</b> - rules of the game for teams. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  - Welcome to the team!  First of all, get acquainted with the manifesto. <br><br>  <b>Finish the little things</b> - when the task is not ready, but the ideas of one designer are already over, you can transfer it to another, so that he can ‚Äúfinish the little things‚Äù.  Or continue to suffer over it yourself. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  - And I will finish the little things later. <br><br>  <b>The man</b> is the candidate. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  - Christina, to you man. <br><br>  <b>Deployment window</b> - the time interval in which the deployment can be performed.  By agreement, this is lunchtime in Moscow, when users from the United States are asleep and have little traffic. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  - It is necessary to secure 5 features. <br>  - But you did not get into the window! <br>  - Then tomorrow. <br><br>  <b>Reinstall the card</b> .  Pods (abbreviated from CocoaPods) is a project dependency manager.  Often, when there are problems with the compilation of the project, reinstalling the pods helps (pod install command).  The joke is that in any incomprehensible situation, you need to reinstall the trash and try to assemble again. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  iOS # 1: My project is not going to. <br>  iOS # 2: Reinstall scams! <br><br>  <b>Pixel perfection</b> is perfect.  Usually used when it comes to icons, but in general, everything should be ‚Äúpixel perfect,‚Äù everything. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  - This icon is not pixel perfect. <br><br>  <b>Shelf</b> - sheer drop in graphics and subsequent recovery. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  - I see the regiment in the number of registrations.  Nothing changed since January 1? <br><br>  <b>Popabol</b> is a dumb thing that hurts users a lot, or a problem that seriously affects a business, which is why it comes from management. <br><br>  <b>Listen to traffic</b> - means that you need to use the sniffer to connect to the device and start listening for incoming / outgoing requests. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  To test part of the tasks, as well as to locate defects, it is important to understand which requests are leaving the client device (smartphone) and that the server is responding to it.  This can be done by listening to traffic. <br><br>  - We do not pass authorization. <br>  - Listen to the traffic: what we send, and what the server sends. <br><br>  <b>Cut by Progard</b> - remove unused classes in the project when building with ProGuard. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  ‚ÄîIn our country, I dragged a bunch of unnecessary classes. <br>  - The bulgarian will be cut. <br><br>  <b>Roll on 100</b> - 100% of users see changes. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  - Anrids rolled by 100. <br><br>  <b>Reopen</b> - update changes in your local repository. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  - Infused feature, I recommend re-upgrade. <br><br>  <b>A pen</b> is a function (method) that can be called and retrieved the necessary data. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  - Where can I get information about the user? <br>  - Pull the handle user. <br><br>  <b>Stylgide</b> - the most important thing in design. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  - Stylgayd - he either is or he is not. <br><br>  <b>Skip handles</b> - transfer the task from one status to another yourself, without the help of a bot. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  - The task is not transferred to the test. <br>  - Skipni handles. <br><br>  <b>A</b> specs document is a feature specification. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  - Everything is written in specs, but check with customs. <br><br>  <b>Stress to regress</b> - regression testing is monotonous and tedious, so not everyone likes them to do, as a result - sometimes stress occurs during a regression. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  When it comes time to regress, then some testers experience stress (an eye begins to twitch, for example, attacks of suffocation and so on). <br><br>  <b>Customs</b> - moderation team content. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  - Customs tins. <br><br>  <b>Under Uganda, to start under Uganda</b> <br><br>  Uganda is a country where there is no Internet, and the easiest way to isolate the environment is to take it to another country.  That is, if the user is in Uganda, then only Ugandans will be able to see its content, but there is no Internet in Uganda, so real users will never be able to see what is going on in testing and, accordingly, they will never get entities that are not ready for production ( may lead to errors).  Therefore, we see only real errors from users. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br><br>  - How are we going to test, so as not to stumble production? <br>  - Let's test under Uganda! <br><br>  <b>Fichebag</b> is an error found in testing a specific task. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  To collect testing metrics, it is important to separate component and integration defects, as well as to be able to clearly localize them in the context of ongoing test activities.  Fichebag is one such way. <br>  - I returned the task to the test. <br>  - Is that the one that had a bunch of fichebags? <br><br>  <b>FeatureBranch</b> - branch (branch) in Git, in which the feature is made. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  A big feature is decomposed into several tasks.  Each task has its own branch.  All tasks on this feature are merged into one branch (feature branch) for further testing and merging with the main branch of development. <br><br>  <b>Ficcate</b> is a process whereby lower priority features are removed from development into a version. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  - We have too many tasks for the version.  All just do not have time.  It is necessary to conduct ficcate. <br><br>  <b>Frieze</b> (also known as freezing) is the first step in creating a release in which the core team assembles ready tasks from others. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  - Today we are freezing, so I will add an article tomorrow. <br><br>  <b>Hotfix</b> - changes made to a running application "on the fly", without stopping work.  It is used to eliminate urgent errors and vulnerabilities. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  Dev # 1: It seems that after the last release the load has increased 15 times! <br>  Dev # 2: It's time to release a hotfix! <br><br>  <b>Hook</b> - event trigger.  A branch goes down, and the hook sends it to the assembly.  Such relationships are great facilitate the work of the developer and make invisible layer of infrastructure, leading to all the beautiful buttons. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  - How do you see the work of a devops-engineer? <br>  - Spread hooks all around and press the button. <br><br>  <b>Hell color</b> - any color that looks like hell. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  - The link color is hellish, but it cannot be changed. <br><br>  <b>Charlick</b> is a tool for monitoring HTTP / HTTPS traffic. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  - Advertising does not come. <br>  - Look at the charlie that there. <br><br>  <b>To stagger</b> is to take some kind of unsafe action.  In everyday work, ‚Äústagger something‚Äù means ‚Äúto perform actions with something that can potentially cause problems‚Äù, which is used to warn others. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  - I'm staggering experiments, crouch! <br><br>  <b>Estimate</b> - before accepting a task for testing, it is necessary to evaluate it, so that after you have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe actual remaining labor costs for a task or a task pool, and also, upon completion of the task, compare the plan or fact.  Estimate - the same assessment. <br><br>  <i>Usage example</i> : <br>  Before testing, the specialist evaluates the upcoming tasks in man-hours.  If the assessment (estimate) is not, then utter the following phrase: <br>  ‚ÄúI looked at the board with our tasks.‚Äù  Where is the estimate, friends? <br><br>  And what professional slang and terms do you use?  Share the most interesting and fun in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/433666/">https://habr.com/ru/post/433666/</a></p>
