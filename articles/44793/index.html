The speakers were full of optimism and happily told how it is cool and easy to develop for mobile devices - in general there is no difference, under which they lead the development, they say, works the same way. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Introduction </h4><br>  Using standard controls, it is very difficult to make a high-quality modern user interface.  Knowing that Silverlight is a competitor to Flash, but from MS, I was very interested in finding out how things were going on the fronts :) I recently watched <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flashlite/">Adobe Flash Lite -</a> I didn‚Äôt like it terribly. <br><br>  I watched this 70-minute <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/PC10/">video</a> .  I won‚Äôt lie, i‚Äôm completely stupid chatter, but nevertheless, I carefully watched and listened, where there was something to watch and listen to :)

      So, what we were shown ... To begin with - a small joke for the seed: <br><br><img src="http://darkest.info/habr/slwm/vs.png" alt="Visual studio"><br>  <i>Is this Visual Studio for Devices ?!</i> <br><br><img src="http://darkest.info/habr/slwm/app1.png" alt="App"><br>  <i>Wow, compiled and launched Hello, World</i> <br><br>  In short, the salt of the joke was that the gentlemen had shot a studio in the resolution of 400x240 and renamed it in Silverlight, after which they had fun running on the device (by the way, that same Samsung i900 Omnia, known as WiTu). <br><br><h4>  Mobile Development Perspectives </h4><br>  After a brief introduction on the importance of developing for mobile devices, the speaker (Giorgio Sardo) began to interview the audience: <br><br>  - raise your hand to those who have a mobile phone (all) <br>  - raise the hand of those who have a mobile phone on Windows Mobile (almost all) <br>  - who has two mobile phones (again almost all) <br>  - who has four?  (Only he himself raised :)) <br>  - Well!  Oh yeah, another question - who has an iPhone?  Yeah thanks!  There is a door over there, thanks for coming!  (cackling in the hall) <br><br>  In short, everyone has mobile phones, respectively, it is quite obvious that developing for mobile devices is very beneficial. <br><br><img src="http://darkest.info/habr/slwm/forecast2010.png" alt="Forecast 2010"><br>  <i>Time Machine from Microsoft - forecasts for 2010 :)</i> <br><br>  In short, everyone is waiting for a bright future of development in C # for a huge number of devices on Windows Mobile ... and Symbian S60!  Well, finally, straight, beauty, can not be!  After all, Nokia with its symbian holds about 75% of the smartphone market, it would be very nice to get on this platform with its software! <br><br><h4>  Demos </h4><br>  Then entertaining demos began.  To start Giorgio for a minute or so nakolbasil floating from right to left along the gradient <b>vector</b> duck.  Beauty! <br><br><img src="http://darkest.info/habr/slwm/duck.png" alt="Vector duck"><br><br>  Slot machine with Gates (well, damn, can not help but it): <br><img src="http://darkest.info/habr/slwm/slot.png" alt="Gates machine"><br><br><h4>  Performance (Brakes) </h4><br>  And then the presentation started what I had suspected from the very beginning and I was sure in advance that I would see it, although I really didn‚Äôt want to.  These were the brakes.  Yes, yes, they are the ones that you most hate on super-powerful multi-megahertz devices. <br><br>  A demo of the toy was shown, in which the brakes were tangible.  But for some reason nobody said anything about them, as if everything should work!  Disgustingly: (No, it didn't slow down everywhere, but the full-screen animation in menus was no good, it would be better if it didn‚Äôt exist at all than that. <br><br>  In the next demo, it was shown that gestures (screen strokes) work for free, know only process it.  The demo, surprisingly, was not very slow (because the animation in it was not full-screen, small ellipses were animated). <br><br><img src="http://darkest.info/habr/slwm/ell.png" alt="Jumping ellipses"><br><br>  The following demo skillfully show photo albums, a list of images for which was taken from the web.  In addition to the demo itself, they showed some XAML and C # code using Linq. <br><br><h4>  Ways to launch applications </h4><br>  One common point for all demos - they run <b>inside IE</b> .  Damn, I hope that when it comes to the release, it will still be possible to make standalone applications.  Well, what the hell - to run on the device software inside the browser.  IMHO absolutely no gate :) <br><br><h4>  Questions from the audience </h4><br>  There was a little more demos, and then it was time for questions and answers.  First of all, the question was asked from the audience about why vector graphics were not smoothed ( <i>in the video you don‚Äôt understand that there is no smoothing!</i> ).  The answer was predictable - well, uh, finally, it's all raw beta, work and work more.  We are still poyuzayu hardware acceleration, etc.  But we are working, after 2 weeks there will be significant improvements!  ( <i>Figase, the peasant has a statement!</i> ) But I don‚Äôt know about smoothing, I‚Äôll be more specific, come up later. <br><br>  Most recently, I wrote about the difficulties with <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/mobiledev/44327/">transparency</a> on WM.  And this sore question was heard from the audience - in the Compact Framework there is no support for the alpha channel in PNG, but what about this in Silverlight2 for mobile?  The answer was the same - the transparency of the buttons works exactly, and what about the PNG - come to us at the exhibition, chat.  It's a shame, but the answer to the question remained behind the scenes. <br><br>  There was also another interesting question - could it be possible to get from the Sliverlight application to the Compact Framework libraries?  The answer is no, everything is within the framework of the Silverlight set of APIs.  ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to suspicious things like PInvoke on a web-site‚Äù :) <br><br>  And finally, an excellent question - Silverlight uses the compact framework.  Excellent if it is already installed.  And if not, what, first put the CF, then Silverlight, and only then the software?  ( <i>realistically, as I imagine, it becomes scary already :)</i> ) <br>  Answered that Sliverlight will pack CF 3.5 and roll it right away if it doesn't find it. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  As a result, there was an ambivalent feeling - on the one hand, everything is pretty cool, but the brakes and work through the browser somehow upset ... it's like <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flashlite/">Adobe Flash Lite</a> - the animation significantly slows down, the "programs" open up in a flash player - well, this is no good programming ¬ªIMHO :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44793/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44793/</a></p>
