      In addition to the words for the introduction, I also have no information about where I came from this netbook and in what configuration it will meet our harsh reality.  But it's the little things, right? <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/20.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So, for sure, many have heard about programs such as <b>OneLaptopPerChild</b> , in which many serious men in jackets invest considerable sums, but in which many still do not believe.  For those who do not know, without going into details, the goal of this program is to create an extremely affordable laptop computer that could in every way promote the education of children even from developing and poor countries.  No matter how it was there, this device has a very mediocre relationship - I wrote this text so that many fans of cool alloy technologies would not point a finger and say ‚ÄúFiii, but this is a toy!‚Äù. <br><br>  No, gentlemen and a few ladies, this is not a toy.  This is a prototype of such a device, but not from some little-known desktop, but from a company that does not need an introduction from <b>Intel</b> .  The fact that this is a brainchild of a silicon giant is not clear at first - there is no label on the device - neither brands nor labels.  Only one sticker - <b>Intel Atom Inside</b> , that, in the light of the latest netbooks that I tested, already inspires some peace of mind. <br>  This device is intended solely for educational purposes and, therefore, most likely it will not be sold in free access.  Okay, I'm not a predictor - it will be as it will be, but for now let's look at what is. <br><br><h3>  Appearance </h3><br>  It is clear that for educational purposes and for an adequate cost / quality ratio, many compromises had to be made, therefore, it is not worth waiting for buildings with metal finish with a fine texture.  In this case, matte white plastic, which has a slightly rough surface, is almost universally used.  Thanks to this, the issue of multiple fingerprints was resolved;  the surface itself is not brand at all - in which case the pollution can be wiped off with a simple soft eraser. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/123.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But there are two parts with different properties - a blue semi-gloss plastic front cover and a rubberized handle for carrying a netbook, a very fancy, but convenient shape.  Apparently, the impression of "toy" just creates this blue cap, but in general it is very practical. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/58.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The handle, which allows you to carry a netbook as a briefcase, is made to last and it becomes clear that it will not fall off soon.  The rest is just an unusual interface element, but, I must admit, very convenient.  It is even strange that other manufacturers of computer assistants do not adopt it. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/19.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the front panel there are three indicators - work, battery and wireless. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/104.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  From the bottom (which is already made of gray plastic) there is practically nothing attractive for children, so it is unlikely that they will have a desire to get into some kind of pencil where it is not necessary. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/67.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It's simple - a two-piece battery with two locks, a closed system compartment and a pair of vents. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/97.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In one of the corners you can see a piece of the stylus - yes, there is a touch screen!  But more about that later. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/77.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the left side there is a VGA port for connecting an external monitor, a vertically oriented USB port (2.0), a slot with a rubberized insertion card reader slot (SD / SDHC) and a ‚Äúpull-off‚Äù button in the switch (s). <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/27.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the opposite side, there is an RJ-45 connector for connecting to a wired network, another vertically-oriented USB port (a mirrored solution for right-handers and left-handers?), Gills and two audio jacks for connecting headphones and a microphone, respectively. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/310.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If you look at the device from the front, then in the middle you can see a rotating camera, which was initially ‚Äúhidden inside.‚Äù  To her left is a microphone. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/47.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the back side is a power connector from the AC adapter, a Kensington lock hole and, in fact, a carrying handle.  One feels that Intel engineers approached the design of the device wisely - there is a small recess on the handle, where you can put a piece of paper with text behind a plastic partition.  You have to agree that if hundreds of children have such ‚Äúportfolios‚Äù, it would be rather difficult to find one among others without such trifles.  Well, the "anti-theft" lock is also not at all superfluous - it will, to some extent, ensure the safety of the netbook. <br><br>  The lid can be opened like a book (almost 180 degrees), if you wish, you can turn it at the same angle clockwise or against (I remind you that the similar <b>EeePC T91</b> turned only clockwise) - as a result you will get a full-fledged small tablet. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/161.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Screen </h3><br>  The netbook has a display diagonal of 8.9 ‚Äùinches and a resolution of 1024x600.  The matte screen allows you to avoid parasitic glare, but it behaves quite predictably in the sun.  Yes, the image in direct sunlight is not the strongest side of matte screens.  For the rest, there are no complaints about the quality of the image - the available brightness is enough to work in all other light environments. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/171.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  An interesting feature is the ability to automatically rotate the image depending on the position of the laptop in space - in <b>T91</b> this was done only in manual mode. <br>  Above the screen is a webcam, which in the embedded software is capable of producing a 1.3 megapixel interpolated image.  By the way, such an image quite slows down with the active movement of the object, however, there are no delays at lower resolutions, which is very surprising.  The camera is very serious, capable of producing a good picture - just enough for skype. <br>  Below the screen there are two speakers - I dare to suggest that the sound quality they give out to audiophiles may not like it) is sufficient for all others.  I preferred to listen to music through headphones, since I got the new Razer Moray + - great! <br>  To the left of the display, on the frame, there are 6 indicators (some of them duplicate the diodes on the front side) and a button to open the quick launch window for applications (more on that later). <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/141.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Keyboard </h3><br>  This is perhaps what I didn‚Äôt like most about this device.  I'll start small - there are no Cyrillic letters, but it is a matter of time and region.  Then - the buttons are small (as on the <b>EeePC 701</b> ) and without gaps - you can print quickly, but not so comfortable.  On the other hand, it should be remembered that the device was not designed for mothers and fathers, but for their children.  The buttons are dark gray - and on this color purple Fn-icons do not look very good, sometimes merging with the background. <br>  I didn‚Äôt like the layout - instead of a button with a tilde (~), one goes right away, so almost always, wanting to type ‚Äú1‚Äù, I dialed a two.  The small right Shift is out of habit so much to the right that it is almost impossible to use it - the button is inactive.  Little Enter, Slash and Backspace - brrr. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/151.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, it is printed well (in English), the key travel is small and quiet, buttons are pressed quite easily. <br><br><h3>  Touchpad </h3><br>  In this model, a rather simple but good touchpad from Synaptics is installed.  It is not multitouch - from the chips you can only mark the vertical part on the right, serving as a scrollbar.  The touchpad is very pleasant to the touch, but the keys below it are even more pleasant.  They are pressed very easily and almost silently - completely different touchpad sensations.  I put a plus sign. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/113.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Stylus - despite the fact that it is somewhat similar to a cheap Chinese wand, it is convenient) Not sliding, optimal in weight and in size (like a pen) - I think children will really like this bonus and forget about the mined-in keyboard.  By the way, it is necessary to recognize that touch control for children is closer, more comfortable and understandable than other types of communication with the digital environment.  So, a white (non-sliding) stylus made of rough plastic is an ideal way to poke a neighbor on the desk. <br><br><h3>  Turn on and work </h3><br>  As I said, the device is turned on with a button on the left side of the case, which needs to be slightly moved.  Immediately after that, the diodes light up and ... from the right end (from the air vent) a light hum of the cooler begins.  I do not see any justification for this - after all, all systems of similar performance (and design) cost only passive cooling!  The only noise in them is the hard drive, and here it is ... solid-state!  In general, it would be possible to make an absolutely silent machine, but, apparently, they were shy.  Well, or decided that in this case there will be nothing to improve in the next model :) <br><br>  The device loads quickly enough - about 30-40 seconds.  When the ‚Äúbook‚Äù came into my hands, it already had two accounts - an ‚Äúadult‚Äù user and a kid.  In the first case, the most common Windows XP Home with a very good set of software was loaded.  In the second case, the same Windows was launched, only having an amazing friendly (childish) interface that can be changed.  Everyone who saw the shell for the first time asked - ‚Äú <i>What kind of Linux is this, I don‚Äôt recognize something</i> ‚Äù.  There are no screenshots of the interface, but it is partially present on the video. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/eJQ66z0ObPY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjlQH4vZnVsQ6O9R9XDqnEk5URf6w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  So, let's talk a few words about the programs of the adult interface. <br>  The first thing I want to mention is handwriting.  In the <b>EeePC T91</b> , 4 input methods were available (from a standard keyboard, from the on-screen keyboard, handwriting recognition, and writing directly with scribbles).  Immediately I counted only 3 ways - the first three of the above. <br>  I really liked the ‚Äúink‚Äù, with which my scribbles were displayed on the screen - I would never have thought that I had such a beautiful handwriting) <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/writr3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The entered text is recognized (by the letter in each cell), and each letter can be rewritten if desired. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/write4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The choice was only English, but again, this is a matter of time.  One of the interesting differences from the T91 is that the on-screen keyboard has mathematical symbols on a separate tab, which I had previously copied through the standard symbol table. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/write5.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/write6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Intel Quick Launcher</b> or the Quick Launch toolbar (yes, the one that is called by the button on the screen or via a shortcut on the desktop) is a large black window on which various shortcuts are located, the number of which can be changed.  If there are more of them than can fit on the screen, then just an arrow will appear that will turn over to the second page - and so on.  Of course, the solution is not as elegant as that of the T91 (where it was also implemented by a special carousel), but more practical and versatile. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/QuickLaunch.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Scroll through the preloaded software labels further.  <b>Evernote</b> is a useful third-party program that allows you to store a lot of different information in order.  I will not describe everything, it's easier to run through the <a href="http://evernote.com/">official site</a> . <br><br>  Awful, just awful ... I was surprised by the program for managing the network profiles and device power profiles.  For the network, the program uses the <b>Intel Network Manager</b> ( <b>Easy Lan</b> ).  The principle of operation is - click on the program, create a new profile, give it a name, an icon, indicate the type of connection (wire or Wi-Fi). <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/easylan4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Selecting Wi-Fi, on the next tab, the program offered me to specify the network identifier (or scan the space), specify its type (Auto / b / g / n!), Type of protection and key for authorization. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/easylan5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  If everything works out, then on the next page there will be a clear picture of the network operation and some data - the selected profile, IP address, signal level, speed and connection status. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/easylan6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Thus, even a child will be able to cope with setting up and changing profiles if necessary (at school, at home, at McDonalds, at ...).  Network scanner is also implemented in a very unusual way. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/easylan3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The second program, for managing energy-saving profiles - <b>Intel Power Manager</b> is just a fairy tale.  No, I like what <b>ASUS</b> did ( <b>Super Hybrid Power Engine</b> ), but in this case more flexibility is available.  Initially there are several profiles (Classmate, Reader, Max Performance), by selecting any of which in the program window, below you can observe its settings for battery and network operation.  You can create your own profile, which I immediately tried to do.  Almost everything is configured - processor speed (from maximum to minimum + adaptive mode), backlight level, network speed, communication module activity, sleep time ... and the same for the case if the power cord is inserted.  Then a beautiful icon is assigned to the profile and everything can be used.  <b>Just super!</b> <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/power-manager.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/power-manager2.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/power-manager3.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/power-manager4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Intel Quick Controller</b> is a small program that allows you to quickly change the volume and brightness, calibrate the screen, turn on the auto-orientation of the image, or simply rotate the image on the screen.  Funny - you can turn off the cursor) Windows without a cursor - how romantic. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/quick-controller.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Intel Education Administrator USB Generation Tool</b> - I have not tried it, but it seems that the program that allows you to create a ‚Äúsalvage‚Äù USB flash drive, from which you can boot from a backup or restore it. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/usb1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  To work with the camera provided a third-party program - <b>ArcSoft WebCam Companion</b> - as a homework assignment for self-study. <br><br>  Well, perhaps the most attractive program - <b>ArtRage2</b> .  In fact, this is a graphic editor, very functional, but due to the touch screen, it is simply impossible not to dwell on it (it's so natural).  Absolutely everyone who got a device tried to portray something ... as a rule, nothing interesting occurred to anyone, and if it did, they didn‚Äôt have the right skills ... well, I conclude that the random number generator is still competitive :) <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/artrage2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The editor is designed more for drawing than image editing.  For this, he has everything - brushes, pencils, erasers, paints, etc ... and I am surprised at how cool and easy it is. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/artrage3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  But I liked even more how the whole picture is drawn on the screen.  Let me remind you - in the EeePC T91, the screen was sensitive not only to the touch of the stylus, but also to the hand, so you could only work on weight. <br>  Immediately, the screen is less sensitive for the hand (you can put it and draw with a stylus), but at the same time, it‚Äôs comfortable to use the interface with your finger.  If you rotate the screen and make it the letter "L", i.e.  to organize an "easel", the screen does not fall under the weight of the hand (even mine, not to mention the nursery).  The stylus is drawn very conveniently - to the <b>Wacom</b> tablets, the screen is, of course, far away, but it is really cool!  Cool, cool, cool! <br><br>  The last thing I would like to pay attention to is special software for monitoring children's profiles for adults. <br>  First you create a profile for the child, specify its level (younger age, school age, teenager, normal user).  Depending on this, the appearance of the desktop changes.  In the second step, we indicate which programs to allow the child (from the list of established).  Then we can choose the widgets that will be on the desktop - sticky sheets, games, calculator, file manager, clock ... Then we specify how to be with the icons in the tray - you can not show them or only show certain ones.  You can prohibit turning on and restarting the computer.  Well, quite a great idea - the bonus system.  You can give your child points for spending more time in developmental programs, or depriving him of just playing games.  Also in this software package, you can create a list of students and schedule of lessons.  From the ‚Äúclient‚Äù side, it all looks in read mode. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/child.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/child2.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/child3.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/child4.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/child5.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/child6.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/child7.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/child8.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/child9.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/child10.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/child11.png" alt="image"><br><br>  This is how it is. <br><br><h3>  Performance </h3><br>  The speed of this device can be compared with the performance of a good expensive netbook.  At the very beginning, I did not specifically mention any technical characteristics, but now I will not turn away. <br>  So, a productive processor with low power consumption, it‚Äôs <b>Intel Atom 270</b> with a frequency of <b>1.6 GHz</b> on an <b>Intel 945GSE chipset</b> .  512 megabytes of RAM inserted into one slot of the two (i.e., you can upgrade the machine quite well).  A 16GB solid-state drive is an excellent solution, because the Netbook will be designed for the most active everyday use.  The integrated <b>Intel 945GME</b> module with 8 megabytes of memory is responsible for the graphics. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/cpuz.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/gpuz.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In <b>Max Performance</b> mode, the <b>CPUFreeBenchmark 2.2</b> test netbook passes in <b>75.17</b> seconds, which is an excellent indicator.  For comparison, the <b>ASUS EeePC 1005</b> netbook on the <b>Intel Atom 280 processor</b> (1.66GHz) passes this test in <b>71.31</b> seconds.  And <b>EeePC T91</b> - in <b>85.24</b> seconds! <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/cpufree1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Intel ClassMate PC</b> calculates Pi in <b>SuperPi 1.5</b> to one million decimal places in <b>96.141</b> seconds ( <b>EeePC 1005</b> - <b>89.594</b> seconds, <b>EeePC T91</b> - in <b>107.609</b> seconds). <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/pi.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The solid-state drive in the <b>HDTunePro 3.50</b> program also proved to be quite good, showing a very small random access time and good speed performance.  The linear reading graph of a very unusual form (even I guess at what it is connected with), the maximum speed is <b>37.2</b> MB / s, and the average is <b>34.7</b> .  The SSD in <b>Asus EeePC T91</b> showed more outstanding results (Mb / s) - <b>61.8</b> and <b>54.3,</b> respectively. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/hdtune1.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/hdtune21.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/hdtune31.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I did not measure work time, but it is about 4-5 hours. <br><br><h3>  Check weighing </h3><br><br>  <u><b>pros</b></u> <br>  - Something new on the netbook market, ideological; <br>  - High-quality assembly, practical durable case, carrying handle; <br>  - The touch turning matte screen; <br>  - A good camera and SSD-drive, a small possibility of an upgrade; <br>  - High performance; <br>  - Good work time; <br>  - Excellent software component !!!; <br><br>  <u><b>Minuses</b></u> <br>  - I think it was possible to do without a cooler; <br>  - Inconvenient keyboard; <br>  - You can still work on the exterior. <br>  - I'm afraid I won't be able to buy it :) <br><br>  I think it‚Äôs generally foolish to take a minus appearance. It‚Äôs not an image model for businessmen, but a tool for children.  And they really liked it! <br><br><h3>  Total </h3><br>  Well, how do you devaysets?  Honestly, I am very surprised!  Despite the fact that it is designed for children, it‚Äôs impossible to call it a ‚Äútoy‚Äù.  More precisely, it is possible - studying the features and software, I started playing so much that I did not notice how nearly a day had passed) <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/191.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In terms of performance, the device comes on the heels of modern netbooks that are sold to ‚Äúadult kids‚Äù, which is good news.  The presence of high-quality touch screen will be appreciated by every child, so I have no doubt that children will immediately find a common language with the device.  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãthis "book" - without hesitation you would buy your child, maybe even yourself, your wife and parents.  You must agree, the company Intel really turned out a very interesting fusion of modern technology.  I think the company can think about the formation of a new field of activity in which it will definitely have some success. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4f5/b12/002/4f5b1200282e620b479767d7c45dbc0b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Successes to you and bright future.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/68390/">https://habr.com/ru/post/68390/</a></p>
