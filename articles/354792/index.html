We are open to cooperation in any areas of activity and in any direction, offering truly reliable services on the most modern server hardware.  Such as we use ourselves from day to day for other areas of business.  This, of course, will be about leasing <a href="https://vps.house/">VPS Windows</a> servers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>VPS.house</b> is not just another one-day hosting, it‚Äôs own project of the telecommunications company Global Communications LLC, originally created as a system integrator that solves everyday automation tasks for large and medium-sized businesses: exam solutions, integration of LEU and ROVD, solutions for medical centers and hosting companies, multifunctional robots for algorithmic trading and much more. <br><br>  Over the years, our own infrastructure has grown to such an extent that it allowed the direction to provide cloud services, to which projects of partner organizations and organizations have been successfully transferred over the past few years, thousands of external systems of new clients, both legal entities and individuals, have appeared.

    <h3>  Affiliate program </h3><br>  We try not to make revolutions from the usual things, our program for partner projects is a classic solution in a modern and convenient design, offering 2 options for interaction between us, you and your clients (users): <br><br><ul><li>  Providing <b>affiliate links</b> </li><li>  Providing <b>affiliate promo code</b> </li></ul><br>  The starting conditions of the affiliate program assume the receipt of <b>10% of deductions</b> from the expenses of the given client.  As the number of active servers grows from such clients, the percentage of deductions increases <b>to 20%</b> . <br><br>  Creating your own promotional codes, you can choose the percentage of discount for the client from the base cost of the server in the configurator on the site.  This percentage will be deducted from your partnership percentage.  So you can immediately provide a discount for your customers at all 10%, and start earning your own income only when the number of customers increases and along with it the percentage of partnership deductions for your account. <br><br>  To participate in an affiliate program, you do not have to be a VPS.house client yourself and keep some kind of server; you just need to create an account and activate the affiliate program in your account. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://vps.house/partner/about">You can read</a></b> more about the conditions of the affiliate program <b><a href="https://vps.house/partner/about">on our website</a></b> . <br><br><h3>  API features </h3><br>  The API functions we have created describe everything that you can do with the server in your account: create, delete, change configuration, manage state and much more. <br><br>  Opportunities in essence allow you to create your own unique cloud service (this is a real <b>White Label</b> ), for your customers only you will be the final service provider and VPS.house will not appear anywhere.  You are free to set prices for services arbitrarily. <br><br>  Taking into account the fact that in conditions of high competition and price dumping, it may not be very interesting to create an isolated service from scratch and promote it, but to introduce the possibility of receiving a <a href="https://vps.house/"><b>virtual server by a</b></a> client who already uses any of your services - a solution that already more than once it was brought to life by the partners of VPS.house.  These can be brokers' private offices (many of their clients require an included 24x7 computer with stable Internet access), services selling software subscriptions / licenses, etc. <br><br>  In addition to the basic functions, you can also <b>create your own ready-made template</b> with pre-installed software and the appearance of the desktop.  According to your request, we will save it and provide its unique identifier so that you can use it to create new servers for yourself or your clients instantly and fully automated! <br><br>  Also to all servers created through the API, we offer to use the promotional code, which gives an eternal <b>discount of 5% for any number of servers</b> ! <br><br>  You can learn more about our API, as well as <b><a href="https://vps.house/learn_api">get acquainted with the documentation with examples, on our website</a></b> . <br><br>  <b>VPS.house</b> is not a service to provide services ‚Äúas is‚Äù, we are always ready to help solve any non-standard tasks of your business.  And the round-the-clock support service is ready to professionally advise you on the most complex issues related to cloud technologies. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/354792/">https://habr.com/ru/post/354792/</a></p>
