  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is interesting to listen to IT person on the radio?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Prologue </h4><br>  I watched TV, once, still studied in the intern <b>and</b> those.  And now there‚Äôs almost nothing to watch, I love the radio more.  So I dreamed since childhood to become a DJ on the radio.  Oddly enough, but dreams tend to come true. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Body </h4><br>  Soon there will be a month, as I conduct a section about the Internet on the Kazakh radio.  The radio station broadcasts throughout the territory of Kazakhstan, <s>almost</s> without advertising on the air;) hard to believe, but it is.  We are listened to by people in the city, as well as by the fire in the steppe, and the children in the villages.  While in Kazakh I tell them about the simplest thing: what is the Internet;  Kaznet;  blog;  e-mail and so on, I prepare myself my audience, so to speak. <br><br><h4>  Plans </h4><br>  I plan in the future to come out twice a week (kaz / rus) in prime time up to 15 minutes, and already telling people news, events and news about IT technologies.  Do not just take a 30 second interview with the guests, but already at least five minutes to discuss a certain event.  As you know, there is something to tell the people and it seems (the radar praises and likes himself) I am good at it.  I would like to share the ratings of the program, but as I heard our and a number of other FM radio stations refused the services of measuring the ratings of programs because of their distrust of the providers of such services.  We also have plans not to record the program, but to go on the air.  Wash, radio - this is live.  There is someone who is learning this business.  If we start to make a program in Russian, I will definitely upload them for you, and there is a chance that you too can become heroes of the program. <br><br><h4>  For sample </h4><br>  So far these are only flowers in the form of a rubric of ~ 4 min. Length.  and they are in Kazakh.  How will that show, so I immediately or you know the Kazakh language?  ;)

    <h4>  Asked </h4><br>  I would like to ask you for advice, ideas and recommendations.  Since the radio can not show the picture as on TV, while telling about the new service on the Internet, I need to be able to ‚Äúdraw‚Äù a picture in the listener's head.  While we study.  And what about telling more about services or about events?  You can tell more news.  Maybe you know the analogs of such programs in radio stations in your city?  I think it will be useful to keep in touch with them.  In fact, I am a programmer-technician with a bias in the web, and I will gladly read various books / blogs about radio journalism or the journalists themselves. <br>  What will be interesting to listen to IT-shnik on the radio in terms of info? <br><br>  Ps.  Since I manage the whole program myself, I will try to implement all the interesting ideas. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83391/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83391/</a></p>
