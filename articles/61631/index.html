    <h3>  Stomach </h3><br>  <strong>The stomach</strong> is a muscular organ with a capacity of 1.5-2 liters, designed primarily for the mechanical processing of food and the breakdown of certain proteins by means of hydrochloric acid and enzymes secreted by it.  Depending on the nature and method of cooking, food can be in the stomach from 4 to 10 hours.  The longest time in the stomach fatty food is delayed and less - fluid. <br><br>  <strong>The stomach loves:</strong> <br><br>  <em>Mode.</em>  At least three, and preferably four meals a day in small portions at about the same time.  This allows the stomach to tune in to the rhythm of food intake and produce the necessary amount of gastric juice in a timely manner.  Ritual.  It is important to treat food carefully, without haste and in good spirits.  This will improve the digestive process, and attention will allow to monitor the quantity and quality of food intake. <br><br>  <em>Meru.</em>  The extra piece will not do him good.  Rising from the table, you should feel a slight feeling of hunger, which in a few minutes will be replaced by a feeling of fullness. <br><br>  <strong>The stomach does not like:</strong> <br><br>  <em>Binge eating.</em>  The stomach does not like it when its owner constantly overeat, swallow food in huge chunks or eat a full meal right before going to bed.  A stomach filled with food does not physically manage to process gastric juice and digest a large amount of food, especially when taken at night.  Unprocessed food enters the small intestine, but since the digestion process did not have time to complete - the food cannot be fully digested and half of it goes to waste.  If such gluttony is repeated day after day, the ligamentous apparatus of the stomach does not withstand the load and stretches to incredible size.  So a person becomes a slave to his stomach.  Lovers of food, he often stretched to 10 liters or more!  To force the muscular apparatus of the stomach to be squeezed only by incredible efforts of the will, and often this problem requires medical intervention. <br><br>  <em>Stress.</em>  As a rule, in response to strong anxiety in our body, adrenaline is released, which has an inhibitory effect on the hunger center in the brain.  But if this system fails or weakens, then a backlash occurs and the slightest excitement only stimulates the person‚Äôs appetite. <br><br>  <em>In a hurry.</em>  Food on the go does not bring the necessary pleasure and saturation.  Snacking along the way, a person, as a rule, ceases to control not only the frequency of meals, but also its quantity. <br><br>  <em>The hunger strike.</em>  To starve yourself is as undesirable as to overeat - any extremes are harmful to a balanced system.  If you still decide to starve, it is desirable to do this under the supervision of doctors. <br><br>  <em>Smoking.</em>  The stomach and after lunch will react to a cigarette negatively, but smoking in the morning on an empty stomach can seriously harm health, provoking a whole range of diseases. <br><br><h3>  Intestines </h3><br>  <strong>The intestine consists of two sections: the</strong> thin (5‚Äì7 m long) and the thick one that exceeds it in diameter (1‚Äì2 m long).  In the intestine the splitting and absorption of water, trace elements, proteins, fats and carbohydrates into the blood and lymph occur.  Digestion time in the small intestine takes from several hours to several dozen.  In terms of physiology, the maximum time spent in the large intestine is up to 24 hours. During the day, the intestine can process about 4 kg of food. <br><br>  <em>Warm food.</em>  Cold or excessively hot dishes and drinks irritate the intestinal mucosa. <br><br>  <em>Fiber-rich foods.</em>  Fiber is only partially digested by our body and therefore plays an important role in the process of excretion, as it increases the motility of the large intestine.  The richest in fiber are cereal (buckwheat, pearl barley), fruits (apples, plums), dried fruits (especially prunes), vegetables (carrots, beets, cabbage, greens). <br><br>  <em>Dairy products.</em>  Kefir, yogurt, cottage cheese and other sour-milk products have a beneficial effect on the intestines, maintaining a healthy microflora and inhibiting the development of putrefactive processes. <br><br>  <em>Early dinner.</em>  Eating easily digestible food no later than 19:00 will allow you to have a good rest while you sleep, not only for you, but also for your intestines, for which sleep is also necessary. <br><br>  <em>Morning Awakening.</em>  An intestine, accustomed to emptying in the morning, works much better during the day and does not create a feeling of excess weight.  A glass of warm water drunk on an empty stomach or an apple eaten before breakfast contribute to this. <br><br>  <strong>The intestine does not like:</strong> <br><br>  <em>Annoying foods.</em>  The irritating products include spicy, fatty, spicy, and smoked food and alcohol.  These products during systemic use lead to inflammation of the intestinal mucosa and constipation. <br><br>  <em>Overheated fats.</em>  Fats and oils left over from previous cooking should not be reused!  From such a "saving" in the intestines rotting microflora flourishes. <br><br>  <em>Poorly cooked food.</em>  Unwashed fruits or poorly peeled vegetables also will not give the intestines pleasure, as well as poorly roasted or, on the contrary, overdone meat or fish.  The intestine is a great specialist in terms of the quality of cooked food. <br><br>  <em>Excess fiber and sugar.</em>  Given that the intestine "loves" foods rich in fiber, it is also necessary to know their measure in them.  Overeating foods high in fiber and sugar (sweets, fruits, berries, nuts and raw vegetables) can lead to the development of fermentation and bloating. <br><br>  <em>Antibiotics.</em>  More than 400 species of beneficial bacteria (in an amount of about 1013) reside in the human intestine.  Healthy intestinal microflora is involved in the synthesis of many vitamins, helps to absorb food better, but, unfortunately, it is very sensitive to all types of antibiotics, which often leads to the development of dysbacteriosis. <br><br>  <em>Dehydration.</em>  Especially the intestines are sensitive to the lack of water in the hot season.  Impaired water balance makes peristalsis difficult and leads to constipation. <br><br><h3>  Pancreas and Gallbladder </h3><br>  The pancreas is the main "cook" in the digestive process.  During the day, her ‚Äúkitchen‚Äù produces almost 800g of pancreatic juice, which is necessary for the enzymatic breakdown of proteins, fats and carbohydrates.  Nutrients split into simpler compounds are absorbed in the small intestine.  In case of malfunction of the pancreas, the entire digestive system suffers.  But the pancreas is not the only body that breaks down nutrients.  Equally important in digestion is the role of the gallbladder, in which the bile produced in the liver accumulates.  The gallbladder is oblong in shape and reaches a healthy size with a small chicken egg.  The role of bile is mainly in the breakdown of fats, stimulation of the pancreas and strengthening intestinal motility. <br><br>  <strong>Pancreas and gallbladder like:</strong> <br><br>  <em>Mode.</em>  These bodies prefer to eat fractional 4-6 times a day in small portions at the same time.  Fiber-rich foods.  Vegetables, fruits, grains, bran are foods that normalize intestinal peristalsis and gall bladder.  They also reduce the prerequisites for stone formation, but it is advisable to use them after pretreatment. <br><br>  <strong>Pancreas and gall bladder do not like:</strong> <br><br>  <em>Irritant.</em>  These products include alcohol, sweets, fried fatty foods (smoked meats, sausages, seasonings).  Raw foods.  It is not recommended to eat raw fruits and vegetables in excessive amounts, especially during the cold season. <br><br><h2>  Let's sum up.  The basic principles of nutrition: </h2><br><ol><li>  <b>Try to limit the number of products of animal origin in your menu: fatty meats and fatty dairy products.</b>  Lard, sausages, wieners, sausages, butter, sour cream and cream is better not to use at all or in small quantities and as little as possible.  Cook on vegetable oils, but be reasonable in quantities, as a rule, cooking of vegetable oil requires quite a bit. </li><li>  <b>Try to eat a balanced diet, eat at least 4-5 times a day, adhering to the proverb: "Eat breakfast yourself, share lunch with a friend, and give dinner to the enemy."</b>  Science has confirmed folk wisdom: the body best absorbs and uses the morning meal, and a light dinner 2-3 hours before sleep will protect you from being overweight.  IMPORTANT: get used to not eating at night, remember that you want to sleep, not only you, but also your organs. </li><li> <b>Eat small meals.</b>  It is not at all rational to endure hunger all day, to eat both first and second and third at lunch in one sitting - this will not only make it difficult to digest dissimilar foods, but will also overly stretch the stomach walls, which will require more and more of you. more food.  It is enough to eat a small plate of porridge for breakfast, for lunch only a portion of the second or soup, and for dinner - a salad.  In between main meals you can, for example, drink a glass of milk or sour-milk products. </li><li>  <b>Your food should be complete in composition, contain all the necessary proteins, fats and carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and its caloric content - to meet your energy costs.</b>  This means that fruits, vegetables, greens must be present in the daily diet, they are the main sources of vitamins.  Do not exclude from the diet natural products, replacing them with low-calorie semi-finished products.  Eat a full meal, but pay attention to its quantity: do not you overeat? <br></li><li>  <b>Eat sweets as little as possible, try replacing sugar with fructose or honey.</b>  First, sugar is not the best helper on the road to health.  Secondly, it is wrong to expect sweets to kill your appetite: carbohydrates are very quickly absorbed, and hunger will return to you faster than you can waste the calories eaten.  Be sensible: it will be much better for your body if you learn to eat not three cookies for tea, but for example one or replace it with a piece of cheese. <br></li></ol><br>  The basic principles of good nutrition will allow you to lead a full life and maintain lightness in the body and good spirits. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fc0/ba2/c8b/fc0ba2c8bbc5ea3fc96d5b736c1fb7ab.jpg"><br>  <a href="http://mkifiles.ru/files/pitanie.pdf">Full version</a> (pdf, ~ 770Kb) <br><br>  PS From myself I just want to add: "Be healthy!". <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> At the request, I post another <a href="http://mkifiles.ru/files/gripp_orvi.pdf">‚ÄúFlu and SARS‚Äù</a> (pdf, ~ 700Kb) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/61631/">https://habr.com/ru/post/61631/</a></p>
