  <section class="page js-page"><h1>twitter what are you doing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  How strongly I have penetrated <a href="http://twitter.com/">twitter</a> in the last week.  I wondered why he had such an effect on me, in thinking about it the thoughts went, rushed far, far away, in unknown directions. <br><br><img src="http://formazon.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/formazon_twitter_3.gif"><br><br>  The first few days I used it as suggested - I wrote about what I was doing, of course, not too primitively <strong>‚ÄúI came home, I was very tired, I‚Äôll go to sleep right now‚Äù</strong> )), but still I quickly got tired of it, got tired of reading this from other users, because when the Internet takes a lot of time and there is still a whole stream of information in the brain that needs to be digested ... As a result, I stopped spending my time on it.  Then somehow in the subway, I had such an unusual state, I sat and thought about life, and after five such stations, they took the <a href="http://twitter.com/formazon/statuses/796801726">form of a clear thought</a> , which for me personally was of great interest, because it went beyond my usual thoughts ... there was a need to write.  It was here that I realized what the convenience of <a href="http://twitter.com/formazon/">Twitter was</a> by going into it through the opera, I recorded what was born by my brain. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of course, you could write this idea anywhere, in any way you like, but the essence of Twitter is just that my friends can read it, as well as the second effect that it produces on me.  The effect is amazing simplicity and ease from the idea to the site.  I really like the logic and design of the site, it's great when you see your thought and nothing extra: <strong>banners, a heaped flash, glamor buttons</strong> and <strong>lots of additional information</strong> .  You visit the site and here it is <a href="http://twitter.com/formazon/statuses/796801726">your thought</a> flies among the clouds:

    <img src="http://formazon.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/formazon_twitter_1.gif"><br><br>  I still wonder how the Internet, and specifically websites, as start-ups often say, from <strong>informational resources are</strong> gradually transformed into some services of <strong>human-person</strong> interaction, a <strong>person with his things</strong> , a <strong>person with his thoughts</strong> and a <strong>person with his life</strong> .  Two or three years ago I couldn‚Äôt even imagine what the Internet would turn into, so I don‚Äôt even think about what we will use in 2010, unless of course the aliens erase the Internet or something else ... Although there is one thought, it looks like now the next step should be done not the Internet, but the devices through which we interact with it ... <br><br>  The third effect is versatility and the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/link/go/40276">number of client applications</a> with which you can work with twitter.  But personally, I like to do it through the site, even from the phone.  I decided to post the most interesting posts on Twitter in my <a href="http://formazon.com/">blog</a> .  By the way, who has an interesting tweet, I will gladly add. <br><br>  These are the thoughts that visited me on Saturday morning. <br>  - </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24247/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24247/</a></p>
