Namely, to find time for a <i>low-priority</i> and very uncritical task - to learn ruby ‚Äã‚Äãon rails.

      Thirdly, I not only mastered the rails, but also wrote a service for SCRUMguides, which we have been using for 9 months now.  For some reason, it turned out much worse for the professional rubists we hired in 2010-2011. <br><br>  Maybe the whole thing in the knee? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f0d/2e4/9c1/f0d2e49c13576f8b075ee166a5e653bc.gif" alt="image">  Or was the fact that no one drove me, I did what I thought was necessary to do, at a pace in which I could work and not chase the results?  <a href="http://www.confeture.com/">By the</a> way, I am still surprised that our <a href="http://www.confeture.com/">confeture.com</a> has already gone through two major conferences.  And survived!  Of course, this is an unfinished product.  This is a launched product ‚Äî a minimal viable product ‚Äî and it still has everything ahead, including serious UX refactoring. <br><br>  But it is not about the product.  It's about what <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Slack-Getting-Burnout-Busywork-Efficiency/dp/0932633617">DeMarco calls "Slack</a> . <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Slack-Getting-Burnout-Busywork-Efficiency/dp/0932633617">"</a> <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  From the English google-translator, translates "slek" as "sagging", "calm" or "beating baklush". <br><br>  <i>Pickling pears</i> is more to my liking.  In addition, that pears can be cooked excellent jam.  And if you're lucky, then candy! <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  I do not advise you to tear the knee ligaments - it is expensive.  But I want to offer you two metaphors that recently help me at <a href="http://scrumguides.com.ua/scrum-for-teams-and-customers/">trainings</a> to explain the <i>benefits of idle workers</i> . <br><br>  <b>1. How often do you see bartenders rubbing glasses?</b> <br><br>  I am constantly (well, in the sense, when I sit opposite the bar).  They <i>really</i> do it all the time.  I wonder is it nervous?  Is it like a tiger in a cage that constantly goes around the perimeter? <br><br>  No, bartenders do this with the utmost attention and importance.  And I do not know about you, but it always gives me pleasure to look at them at this time.  As in other matters, and use icy mojito from a clean glass. <br><br>  Why are we so afraid of leaving our teams for several days <i>without work</i> between sprints.  Surely you do not have dirty dishes, unclean code, or at least ideas "to play"? <br><br>  We have a training case with such a case: ‚Äúwhat to do if the product uoner did not show up to plan the sprint?‚Äù 90% of the participants think that it is worth starting the sprint without it.  Why?  <i>In order not to stand idle</i> .  But isn't it better to wipe the glasses or scrub the floor in McDonalds, than to prepare an unnecessary cocktail or big bag to throw?  You decide. <br><br>  <b>2. How long have you been in the relay?</b> <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/be1/973/38d/be197338d0765e1e5ddcd47bdbe2b44e.jpg">  Probably the last time at school in physical education class ... But even if you had it fifteen years ago, like me, you still remember the expectation of transmission. <br><br>  I really don‚Äôt remember how it was, but I can easily imagine myself as a relay ... <br><br>  I pull my hand.  A little bit more my friend will run to me.  I grab his wand and start.  Actually, this is no wand.  But there is no time to think, you need to tear with all your might.  Especially because fifty meters ahead of me nervously waiting for my second friend.  He is immobilized and looks at me with the utmost attention.  No, not on me, <i>on the wand</i> .  He still does not know that this is no wand ... But there is no time to think.  I rush as quickly as possible, knowing that now all the girls of the class are looking at me (yes, she is also).  But there is no time to think ... And now, after five seconds, I stand with my hands down on my knees and wait for normal breathing to return to me.  And at this time, my friends bring this fucking stick to the finish line. <br><br>  What are watching the audience during the relay?  What does our fizruk watch all the time?  To ensure that the baton was in motion all the time.  Only in this way will the team achieve the best result.  Even if for this most of the team has to <i>stand idle</i> . <br><br>  Now you know what is common between the bartender, baton and rattling pears.  This is SLACK.  Do yourself a tattoo with such a word or what? <br><br>  But no, it will not work, there is no time. <br><br>  Something like this. <br>  Your cree <br><br>  I am down, my dear. <br>  And take care of your knees. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/163215/">https://habr.com/ru/post/163215/</a></p>
