  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Build a coworking in the Crimea. Part Two: Presentation and Idea Verification</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sloboda/blog/232205/">first part,</a> we talked about how the Sloboda idea appeared, how we broke it into hypotheses and how they were tested. <br><br>  Having shown our prototype on the Tomsk land, we decided to enter the All-Russian level.  The next step was the presentation at the largest event for startups in Russia, <a href="http://startupvillage.ru/">Startup Village</a> , which took place on June 2-3 in Skolkovo.  We plunged into the work processes and only the day before, on Friday, we realized that it would start on Monday.  As a result, we only had one day to prepare, but we did not intend to miss this opportunity. <br><br>  It was decided to present Sloboda in an unusual format: to treat everyone with Crimean wine and at the same time pitch the project.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  Task: <br>  - buy 150 bottles of Crimean wine, while stores sell alcohol; <br>  - till 7 in the morning print a poster and buy a stand under it; <br>  - print flyers (and before that, make a design and impose them). <br><br>  In general, the work in Moscow and Tomsk was in full swing all night. <br><br>  At first we were preparing to exhibit on the first day of the conference: we distributed the roles, thought out the design of the counter, and the bottles were already fervently ringing in the trunk as we drove up along the concrete road to the conference site.  But by agreement with the organizers, it was decided to postpone our performance on the second day.  So we had the opportunity to take a break and gather strength, walking through the fields of Skolkovo, admiring the nanocoses (at a price of 55 million rubles each). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/64b/9de/3fd/64b9de3fd6604940b65912c10fbe78bd.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ed5/1a2/089/ed51a20898734d1f92bdf1cd787d2062.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/009/eaf/53f/009eaf53f1c14a38a0372407cbda3bf7.jpeg"><br><br>  Day two, 6:30 am, round-the-clock printing.  We collect cups with stickers that read ‚ÄúDrink the Crimean, Sloboda treats‚Äù with the address of our site.  At first, we planned to heroically glue the stickers ourselves, a couple of hours before the start of the wine spill, but thanks to the delay, we gave this task to outsourcing.  As a result, a specially selected person, who sat at the table in quiet conditions, took 5 hours to paste over 1000 glasses.  By evening, the 3x6 cm sticker will remain our only weapon in promoting the Sloboda brand. <br><br>  We were lucky: the place we got was near the free water source, and this drastically increased the throughput of our improvised bar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fd4/1c7/011/fd41c7011ae64d43ab0680fee0c69843.jpeg"><br><br>  The first half of the day turned out to be successful: people passed by, were interested, took photos of our mini-stand, someone even thanked for free water.  Everything was fine until one of us got a sunstroke.  Gradually, it became clear that one Leshe Kistenev and with a spill, and with a pitch can not cope. <br><br>  But we did not come for nothing.  25 boxes of Crimean wine were waiting in the basement, there was nowhere to retreat.  ‚ÄúDrag‚Äù, like a marshal before a decisive battle, gave an order to Lesch. <br><br>  By the way, in addition to the wine, we bought cherries.  At first they wanted to take a box (5kg), but in the end they took three - and did not lose it at all.  At first, the employees of the neighboring kiosks attacked her; apparently, foreigners were talking incomprehensibly.  Passersby connected to them.  While the wine was just beginning to find its consumer, the container with cherries was rapidly emptying.  Testing the hypothesis ‚Äúthe conference visitors will drink the Crimean wine‚Äù revealed and confirmed a completely different hypothesis: ‚Äúthe cherries had to take more, much more‚Äù (* confused *). <br><br>  In the meantime, tasters with participants' badges began to appear, and the experiences receded.  Opened, poured, told, repeat the cycle. <br>  - you what? <br>  - I would be white dry. <br>  - Yes, and I red dry. <br>  - What is the wine in this series? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e9/588/e13/6e9588e134ee4631acab8ab8a48207aa.jpeg"><br><br>  Suddenly, success came, the appropriate ones literally said the following: ‚Äúwe heard that very tasty wine was poured here somewhere.‚Äù  If they talk about you, then hooked!  And then it flew by itself: among the visitors there were Tomsk citizens who helped pour and bark, and because they were treated to wine, the employees of the neighboring kiosks shared pastries, which the visitors immediately received. <br><br>  The wine turned out to be just right: there was almost no demand for the last glasses.  By this time, there were only a few visitors left, but practically at each table there was a glass with the inscription ‚ÄúSloboda treats‚Äù telling our story without our direct participation.  This is how we, a small company from Tomsk, gave to drink one of the biggest conferences in Russia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/738/865/69e/73886569e16c43a5b5828ac09333afe3.png"><br><br>  In the next post we will tell you how we landed in the Crimea, and about finding a suitable site.  Stay tuned! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/234645/">https://habr.com/ru/post/234645/</a></p>
