In the article we tried to describe the advantages and disadvantages of adding new functionality to the website of the online store. <br><br>  <b>Comparison / selection of analogues</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/97b/722/6fe/97b7226fea02bbd7496dcfa91eef7137.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For buyer: <br>  1. The ability to once again make sure that the selected product is better. <br>  2. Seeding doubts in the buyer at the expense of the correctness of the choice of this product. <br>  3. The ability to see the characteristics of not just a specific product, but the whole category of goods, also in comparison with the product that the buyer considers.  This may lead to the discovery to the buyer of the hidden characteristics of this group of products. <br>  4. The ability to not steaming, find an analogue and quickly buy. <br><br>  For marketer: <br>  1. The increase in time that the user spends on the site <br>  2. Increase user confidence in the online store <br>  3. In some cases, an increase in the time taken by the buyer to make a purchase.

      For the business owner: <br>  1. Additional statistics on what product look for analogues. <br>  2. Additional costs for maintaining the functionality of this functionality. <br><br>  Conclusion: <br>  Introduction of selection of analogs and products for comparison is most often applicable for the B2B segment, when a wholesale company selling goods through an Internet distribution system (personal account) allows its partners to choose the replacement of the necessary goods, because in B2B there is often the possibility of using alternatives. <br>  In the segment of B2C sales, the need to implement this functionality can be very controversial.  Perhaps, in B2C, interesting, in our opinion, technologies created by the project <a href="http://kuznech.com/">kuznech.com</a> will be used <a href="http://kuznech.com/">once</a> .  Technology will allow for example to pick up a girl like a bag, shoes, etc. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dfa/29a/2f0/dfa29a2f0218ddfa5307afafc9918884.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Customer Reviews / Ratings</b> <br><br>  For buyer: <br>  1. The ability to verify the quality of the goods <br>  2. The opportunity to be disappointed in the quality of the goods <br>  3. Gives confidence in the impartiality and honesty of the seller <br><br>  For marketer: <br>  1. The ability to manage demand, if you write reviews and moderate other people. <br>  2. The increase in time that the user spends on the site <br>  3. Increase user confidence in the online store <br>  4. In some cases, an increase in the time taken by the buyer to make a purchase. <br>  5. The possibility of concentrating on the site of a community store discussing a product, and therefore increasing the number of loyal users <br><br>  This functionality is for the business owner: <br>  1. The ability to draw conclusions when purchasing goods of various manufacturers. <br>  2. Additional costs for maintaining the functionality of this functionality. <br><br>  Conclusion: <br>  The introduction of the ability to leave reviews and read others gives the online store specific marketing advantages.  In our opinion, an interesting project that allows to implement this functionality is <a href="http://www.testfreaks.ru/">www.testfreaks.ru</a> .  The service allows you to use product reviews left on various websites of the Runet (unfortunately, there are not many product categories in the service yet). <br><br>  <b>With this often buy</b> <br><br>  For buyer: <br>  1. Gives you the opportunity not to forget to buy an accessory or the necessary add.  equipment to the goods <br><br>  This functionality for the marketer: <br>  1. Provides the ability to increase the average bill <br>  2. Increase user loyalty to the online store <br>  3. Provides the ability to make successful promotions on products that are often purchased together. <br><br>  This functionality is for the business owner: <br>  1. Additional costs for maintaining the functionality of this functionality. <br><br>  Conclusion: <br>  The introduction of a function on the website of an online store, which can push the buyer to purchase a related product, is usually quite cheap, but brings a significant positive effect to the business.  Depending on the online store platform used, this functionality is implemented by programming or purchasing a ready-made module. <br><br>  The general conclusion is this: if you want to apply new functionality in your online store, first evaluate them from different sides, and not just from the client, then your innovations will be as effective as possible! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/175965/">https://habr.com/ru/post/175965/</a></p>
