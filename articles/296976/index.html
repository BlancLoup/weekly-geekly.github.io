  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Contextual Advertising: Quotes vs. Negative Keywords</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Suppose you sell air conditioners and created an advertising campaign in Yandex.Direct or adWords.  You wrote an ad, specified the keyword `air conditioners`.  Now your ad will appear to all users whose request includes "air conditioners".  Even if the user asks Yandex for "repair of air conditioners." <br><br>  At first glance, there is nothing wrong with that - because you are not paying for impressions, but for clicks.  A user who is interested in repair is unlikely to click on your ad.  However, ‚Äúempty‚Äù impressions will lower your CTR, and the cost of the position depends mainly on this indicator.  As a result, in the future you'll pay more per click. <br><br>  There are two methods of dealing with leftist shows.  The first is negative keywords, the second is "quotes" (in adWords, strict correspondence).  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/107330/">There is an opinion</a> that negative words are worse.  However, it is not.  90% is better to use negative keywords. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

 "air conditioners reviews" 
 "air conditioners lg"
 ... </pre></blockquote><br><br>  May be a <b>mixture of</b> quotes and negative keywords <br><blockquote><pre> "air conditioners" 
 air conditioners reviews -compressor -repair -mobile -...
 air conditioners lg -compressor -repair -mobile -...
 ... 
</pre></blockquote><br><br>  Negative soft filter, which is not prohibited, is allowed.  Quotes hard - what is not allowed is forbidden.  Negative words leave trash, and quotes along with trash filter out and useful queries.  At first glance it may seem that the more accurate, the better and you should always use quotes.  However, this is not the case. <br><br>  <b>Unreasonable decrease in coverage - money draining</b> <br>  Suppose we arbitrarily reduce coverage.  For example, turning off the display on even hours.  The number of clicks will decrease.  To return clicks to the previous level, we will have to raise the bid and pay more per click.  As a result, for the same number of clicks, we will need to pay more.  Unreasonably reducing the coverage we drain money. <br><br>  In other words, splashing water with a child is not our goal. <br><br>  <b>15% of Google searches never met before</b> <br>  Some quotation supporters cite the fact that 15% of Google‚Äôs search queries have never met before.  And minus-words can not be cut off.  However, it means that these queries are just a unique combination of words and do not contain new words.  It would be fun if Google users would come up with a billion new words per day. <br><br>  If the user enters "repair of air conditioners in the Balashikha for 1000 rubles," then this query will quietly be minimized by the word "repair." <br>  But to predict all requests in the style of "air conditioner lg for 10,000 rubles with a guarantee" is impossible, so quotes are losing here. <br><br>  <b>CTR calculation features</b> <br>  The cost of the positions depends on the CTR.  The more CTR you have, the less you have to pay per click.  However, what CTR uses Yandex for calculation?  Just splits clicks into impressions?  It is unlikely, in this case, the cost of the positions immediately after the creation of the ads would be very much jumped due to statistical errors. <br><br>  For example, if you have only one impression, then the clicks / impressions will be either 1/1 = 100% or 0/1 = 0%.  And if there are no shows, then the average CTR is not defined at all.  Yandex uses a CTR forecast, rather than a simple average. <br><br>  If you have no impressions, the forecast will be equal to the average CTR of your competitors.  Further, the more impressions you have, the more the forecast takes into account your ratio of clicks / impressions.  Therefore, if our real CTR is higher than that of competitors, it is more profitable for us to have more impressions.  As your predicted CTR increases with impressions, this reduces the cost of a click. <br><br>  The average skill of users of Yandex.Direct is not high, more than half does not use negative words and other syntax.  So be sure that your click / impression ratio will be higher than your competitors. <br><br>  Displays to calculate the forecast are taken into account for 28 days and for each keyword separately.  Therefore, it is more profitable for you to have one keyword with 1000 impressions, than to split it by 10 to 100. Here the negative keywords win, other methods involve crushing. <br><br>  <b>Convenience of work</b> <br>  In the examples at the beginning of the article, it is obvious that using negative keywords is much more convenient.  The text is much smaller and can be transferred to the level of an ad or campaign.  If you use quotes or a mixture, you need to enter a lot of text.  And Direct has an unpleasant feature - when editing, it displays all keywords in a heap, separated by a comma, and not each on a separate line.  If there are more than 10 keywords, then finding something in this mess is difficult.  Editing turns into flour. <br><br>  Yes, do not forget about the limit of 4 thousand characters, which is easily exceeded with quotes and a mixture.  We have to create two or three ads.  As a result, the statistics need to be summarized in the head, but in order to edit one ad, you need to change as many as three. <br><br>  In adWords, word order is even more fun with strict compliance.  Those. <pre>  "Moscow air conditioners" </pre>  in Yasha, it is [Moscow air conditioners], [Moscow air conditioners], [Moscow air conditioners] on Google. <br><br>  If you use a mixture or quotes, then the statistics on keywords is given separately and you have to summarize it in your head. <br><br>  <b>Exceptions</b> <br>  Of course syntax is useful.  But such cases are not more than a few percent. <br><br><ul><li>  A lot of trash.  More than 2/3 hits trash.  Need to use a mixture. </li><li>  Very small budget.  The budget is not enough to cover the entire coverage, even at a rate of 1 cent.  And at the same time we need targeted traffic.  Need to use quotes </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296976/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296976/</a></p>
