  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Saa Prominent future, cloudy prospects?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Someone doubts that SaaS and Cloud Computing will occupy a significant market share, some don't.  SaaS is beneficial primarily to soft builders, and Cloud Computing to new-generation hosters.  And in a consumer society they are the drivers, not consumers.  Or not‚Ä¶ <br>  Recently, articles and laudatory and frightening sense.  About how much happiness will be spilled on us when we switch to these technologies, marketers will tell us.  Than they were initially dangerous Stallman himself wrote.  People who are less detached from real needs write about potential problems.  Practical users write about their experiences with different clouds, pros and cons. <br>  I want to try to reflect on the problems and propose a draft solution that would certainly suit me. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Further I as well as several habr-authors to me will just write "cloud" instead of SaaS and / or Cloud Computing.  Nonspecialists do not care, and experts, and without that, laugh at the whole article. <br>  Also, to simplify, I divide people into opponents and defenders of clouds and hyperbolize them somewhat. <br>  So, what causes a feeling of uncertainty and discomfort for a potential cloud user - ‚Äúcompany‚Äù, when he thinks about using ‚ÄúSaaS‚Äù, ‚Äúcloud hosting‚Äù or full immersion into ‚Äúcloud‚Äù. <br><br><h3>  1. Privacy </h3><br>  Opponents of the clouds are afraid of transferring their databases to outside companies.  They will be taken there.  Defenders argue that the SLA should protect against this, and most of the leaks of private information on statistics came from just staff members. <br>  In general, both sides are wrong.  It all depends on the details.  If the company‚Äôs network and KIS administer ‚Äústudents‚Äù ‚Äúfor food‚Äù, then moving to a cloud hoster, where the connection is encrypted, SLA is monitored and only professionals work, will significantly enhance information security.  If, on the contrary, you have a real sysadmin and / or a qualified developer, and the cloud is doubtful, or ‚Äúas a result of a programmer‚Äôs error‚Äù collects private information on the side, there is reason to beware.

    <h3>  2. Support 24 * 7 </h3><br>  The management of the company is afraid that if the system collapses, it will not be responsible for the restoration of work.  And the admins of the companies, when the googlodks were lying were obviously not at ease from absolute helplessness.  The defenders of the clouds rest on the exceptional rarity of such collapses.  And at the same time they point to the ability of careless administrators to drop the system in exactly the same way for several hours.  A memorable fall of Yandex convinces that the pros can mess up.  In general, under this item, an honest score of 1: 1.  But from the point of view of the company's personnel, it is more pleasant to kick a specific person and not a distant cloud.  By the way, while typing this article, a painless error <code>‚ÄúGoogle Docs has encountered a server error or bug.

We are looking into the problem now. <br> Please try one of these interim solutions: <br> * Reload this page. <br> * Download the document by right-clicking it in the main document list and selecting "Export."‚Äú</code> <br> <br><h3>  3. Inherited Systems </h3><br>  KIS which was created on Clipper, Fox Pro, MS Access 2.0, or 1C, used not only for the sake of balance leads to incomplete and / or transition to the clouds.  In general, without solving this problem, the value of clouds is generally not visible.  But SaaS not only does not suffer from this, but, with a flexible approach, the authors, on the contrary, can benefit from similar traditional applications.  The problem with legacy systems is usually that if everything works, management simply does not want to pay for technology upgrades. <br><br><h3>  4. API Standards </h3><br>  Like offline life, API standards are a powerful competitive tool.  There can be no talk of universality or cross-platform speech.  Well, except about the cross-platform client, displayed in the browser part.  But unless GMail is a classic, it also supports the POP3 and IMAP mail standards besides the web interface. <br><br><h3>  5. Internet addiction </h3><br>  Opponents of the clouds are not very much sticking out the total dependence of the clouds on the Internet connection, since the vast majority of potential consumers of cloud services are absolutely dependent on the Internet.  Although I would like to be able to work offline, and synchronize when the connection is restored. <br><br><h3>  6. Vendor dependence </h3><br>  Opponents compare going to the cloud with voluntary surrender to the cloud hoster.  And apparently due to the lack of imputed arguments, the defenders of the clouds ignore these fears.  And what about a company that has made a bid for one API or a hosting provider, and they, roughly speaking, have either bent or become painfully unprofitable. <br><br><h3>  Solving all my problems with SaaS and Cloud </h3><br>  The only way to solve all the problems listed at once is Open Source.  I see it as follows. <br>  There is an installation package for Cloud or SaaS, not only the client part but also the server part.  And the settings allow the local server to be made backup so that it can work as one single or local backup of the cloud. <br>  Let's go through the problems in the reverse order. <br>  <b>6</b>  Vendor dependency is no longer a problem: you can go to another cloud hoster simply by installing its server part.  You can deploy the server itself. <br>  <b>5</b>  When you turn off the Internet office will work with a local server.  Of course, it will not be able to completely replace the cloud / SaaS and most likely it will slow down, but the main work will not arise. <br>  <b>4</b>  You can always attach the gateway to any protocol to the open software.  As an outstanding example - jabber, which has transport to almost any IM network: ICQ, Mail.ru, vkontakte, MSN, IRC and others. <br>  <b>3</b>  This is debatable, but it seems to me that it is more profitable to transfer the legacy system immediately to the open source database (but it is not necessary to make it open itself). <br>  <b>2</b>  If you not only set yourself a local server, but also hire an admin, you will receive both the stability of the cloud and the local person in charge. <br>  <b>1</b> .  Openness should at a minimum facilitate the search for points of uncontrolled abuse of privileges.  And as a maximum, it will allow you to fully protect yourself from enemies under the condition of through encryption. <br>  <b>0</b>  divided into me. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92321/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92321/</a></p>
