      First you need to turn off the laptop and disconnect it from the mains.  Then turn it over and remove the battery. <br>  We take out the hard disk (2 screws, red circle), drive the laser disks (1 screw, red square) and unscrew the bottom cover (red triangles).  It is worth noting that the screws on the cover are not completely unscrewed, they remain attached to the cover, which is undoubtedly convenient. <br><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f36/034/93b/f3603493b5e38896d4a244db7e35ce8a.jpg"><br><br>  We remove the bottom cover, slightly prying it in a special recess on the right, except for the screws it is held by several more latches.  Before us appear the insides of a laptop. <br>  We unscrew the 2 screws under the battery in order to get further to the screws holding the keyboard. <br><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/739/f8f/75a/739f8f75aafc3f71220e9bf6e450650c.jpg"><br><br>  We turn over our laptop and gently hook the panel above the keyboard.  Dell laptops are characterized by such a panel, sometimes it is not even fastened to the screws and can be easily removed in order to get to the keyboard screws. <br><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7b7/fad/30b/7b7fad30b825302fffde75e8db88eed6.jpg"><br><br>  <u>!!!</u>  <u>Attention:</u> this operation must be performed without jerks and as carefully as possible, because  the panel is connected to the motherboard with a cable that can be damaged. <br><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9c8/467/5da/9c84675dac168239526b802ced424546.jpg"><br><br>  After raising the bar above the keyboard, 2 screws will be available that secure the keyboard itself.  We unscrew them, after which we lift the keyboard by the upper edge by moving ourselves to 25 ¬∞ degrees and by moving upwards we take it out of the case. <br><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cab/5ad/974/cab5ad97451238446b2966f189972f91.jpg"><br>  <u>!!!</u>  <u>Attention: the</u> keyboard is also connected to the motherboard with a cable. <br>  Now the plugs of the top panel and keyboard plugs are available. <br><br>  Flex top panel is mounted in a special connector.  To remove it, you need to move the mount brown (preferably simultaneously from both sides).  Most of the cables in laptops are attached in this way. <br><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0ef/013/310/0ef013310f0568bcb41ba90aa5a21e49.jpg"><br><br>  The keypad cable is fastened in a similar connector, but removed a little differently: it is necessary to slightly pry the brown presser bar, turn around, it will release the cable. <br><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d2c/ee3/8d5/d2cee38d584174d17a54bd3224147429.jpg"><br><br>  Now you need to free from all the wires of antennas and cables cover with a screen. <br>  The loop for transferring the image to the screen is under the keyboard (already taken) on the left.  It is enough to slightly pull the special ‚Äútail‚Äù (in our case, blue) and disconnect it from the laptop motherboard. <br><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ecd/185/6af/ecd1856af75840fd25b525b278136e37.jpg"><br><br>  Now you need to disconnect the wires leading to the antennas of wireless devices.  Turn the notebook upside down again and disconnect the antenna connectors from the devices.  In our case, there was only a wi-fi adapter.  In the other slots you can put a couple of different devices, for example, a WiMax module, a 3G modem, a Turbo Memory for a couple of gigabytes ... This expands the possibilities of the subsequent upgrade of the laptop very widely. <br>  It is worth noting that, regardless of the configuration, antennas are divorced for all 3 pci-e slots. <br><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/463/b6d/5e2/463b6d5e25abc7b77046dd4443d1d130.jpg"><br><br>  Carefully remove the wires from the grooves (they are fixed with special projections). <br><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2eb/dd0/545/2ebdd05450236c1ea882f2babd707f52.jpg"><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/115/7a2/6c1/1157a26c1bf52261066671763daa8deb.jpg"><br><br>  After disconnecting all the wires and cable, proceed to disconnect the laptop screen from the main body. <br>  In the lower part of the case, unscrew one screw on each side, fastening the screen brackets (marked on the case with the letter D) <br><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7a8/f3a/9c6/7a8f3a9c68dc0d0b4e7267e96fb8b051.jpg"><br><br>  To the right and left of the keyboard, unscrew the 4 screws with a large hat (2 on each side) and the fifth one for the future (it does not hold the brackets, but you still have to unscrew it). <br><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6e1/0ff/5c9/6e10ff5c94810b9c6e58a729486afb64.jpg"><br><br>  Safely remove the screen, pulling it up, and set aside. <br><br>  In this notebook configuration, there is no bluetooth module, but the prudent manufacturer did not deprive the laptop of a corresponding cable, leaving the possibility of self-improvement (if you buy a bluetooth adapter).  It is located under the keyboard.  left.  We simply draw the wire from behind the ‚Äúears‚Äù and remove the cable from the connector. <br><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/db0/90d/4b7/db090d4b74d3cbecedb91723589d46bb.jpg"><br><br>  For further parsing, you need to unscrew the 2 screws under the keyboard, disconnect the touchpad cable, the indicating unit cable (indicators on the front panel) and the speaker connector. <br><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c15/8f1/067/c158f106763535e41307025a1eabd8a7.jpg"><br><br>  Turn over the laptop.  Now you can remove the radiator from the processor. <br>  Unscrew the 5 screws and carefully raise the radiator. <br><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8d5/c14/193/8d5c14193f32146a91942ce28354daad.jpg"><br><br>  <u>!!!</u>  <u>Attention:</u> during the unscrewing of these screws you cannot use a large amount of physical force and press on the motherboard.  Strong pressing and deflection (deformation) can damage it! <br><br>  In our configuration, the laptop was equipped with a Celeron processor installed in socket P, which allows you to install a Core 2 Duo processor on the Merom (Santa Rosa) core, for example, the T7250 2.0 GHz. <br><br>  Unscrew the remaining screws located below. <br><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/121/0f2/439/1210f243971e79968ab7bb8c29486a71.jpg"><br><br>  After all the screws are unscrewed, you can open the laptop case by simply lifting the top silver part. <br>  <u>!!!</u>  <u>Attention:</u> in the place where the drive was, there are several latches that need to be gently snapped off without breaking off. <br><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a82/d9a/4d5/a82d9a4d5dbbd9ac684d22a84a35cc94.jpg"><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/464/856/428/4648564284cdf2be8aa73d04789020ee.jpg"><br><br>  Next, remove the bar on the front panel, where the holes for the headphones, microphone and card reader are located, and behind which there is a microphone and an infrared port (IrDA). <br><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e4e/193/ea2/e4e193ea2c65f3850e4f451442402e93.jpg"><br><br>  Finally, we got to the laptop motherboard, take it off. <br>  To begin, disconnect the cable connecting the board of the laptop's power buttons to the motherboard (highlighted with a red oval).  We will divide further actions into 3 parts (see the Legend in the photo) <br><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c72/c23/b15/c72c23b15e8312e02320f9c31050462f.jpg"><br><br>  1. Disconnect the expresscard slot by unscrewing the 4 screws and the cable loop of the wireless on button.  It is worth noting that the switch is not simple, in conjunction with the Wi-Fi Catcher function, allows you to detect a wireless network signal without turning on the power of the computer. <br><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d9e/282/0b0/d9e2820b0d31f272a27a234ab9e695d2.jpg"><br><br>  2. Move to the left side, unscrew one screw and disconnect the connector of the cooler that cools the processor heatsink. <br><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f1c/37e/b63/f1c37eb63d5938a0196d9c015fb91a58.jpg"><br><br>  3. In the upper right corner, unscrew another 2 screws that secure the card with two usb connectors and an s-video video output <br><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5f7/87b/4d9/5f787b4d953ea3ea9b419388feeb253a.jpg"><br><br>  Now you can separate the motherboard from the bottom of the case.  Carefully remove the board from the case, given that all the connectors are slightly deeper in the sidewalls of the case.  We display the motherboard in such a way that these connectors painlessly come out of their slots. <br>  The cooler remains on the case, remove it by unscrewing 2 screws. <br><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3b7/b10/7de/3b7b107de380d734c04d78702250bbf9.jpg"><br><br>  If necessary, remove the speakers and switchboard wireless network. <br><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2ec/539/f34/2ec539f346dda596150ca66ab26d1664.jpg"><br><br>  The board with the laptop's power buttons is glued, more precisely secured to a double-sided tape. <br><br>  Here we see a laptop motherboard, if necessary (or desired), by unscrewing 3 more screws, you can disconnect the additional power connector board and the usb port board and the s-video output. <br><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/08a/953/989/08a953989b7531b928bbae9925a14709.jpg"><br><br>  Let's proceed to the analysis of the laptop screen. <br>  At each of the four corners are rubber plugs covering the screws.  Most often they are glued on a double-sided scotch, but it happens and just keep in the recess.  Slightly we hook them, and screws which are turned off become accessible. <br><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/13b/4a1/49a/13b4a149a353761201302426fcfdf3d3.jpg"><br><br>  The following is a somewhat time consuming procedure to detach the screen frame.  This frame is held on snaps located around the perimeter.  Sometimes there is, in addition to the latches, double-sided tape.  With akkutnymi movements we derive the frame from the latches, hooking it from the inside. <br><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/02f/3e6/e36/02f3e6e36315d4395dc3f38d37d751f7.jpg"><br><br>  <u>!!!</u>  <u>Attention:</u> it is necessary to act without pressure on the matrix in order not to damage it. <br>  It is convenient to use an auxiliary tool for this operation, for example a plastic card. <br><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/57a/ca8/e0a/57aca8e0a0560646d1c81d8c8d419fac.jpg"><br><br>  So, the frame was safely removed, the screws securing the matrix with the side slats on the cover became available.  Unscrew one screw on each side, below (marked with a triangle). <br><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1ea/b8e/277/1eab8e27797e3e296372efd250d35fbf.jpg"><br><br>  Remove the matrix along with the train.  Also on the body of the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãfixed inverter board, powering the matrix illumination lamp.  A 30pin cable is plugged into the matrix connector and secured with tape. <br><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ada/307/60f/ada30760f303e1ab26dd2eb4cb9c2254.jpg"><br><br>  Under the matrix, on the screen cover you can see 3 antennas for wireless devices installed in the pci-e slots. <br><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d47/e4e/990/d47e4e99043f2e5265bec17726b1407f.jpg"><br><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f39/631/0a2/f396310a211069908a5216e366b97a90.jpg"><br><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1d5/a69/ac4/1d5a69ac40ac503da759c07e091668f4.jpg"><br><br>  Also, in the upper corner you can see a magnet.  It is necessary for the reaction of the laptop to close the lid (at the bottom of the case, to the left of the touchpad, there is a corresponding sensor). <br><br><img title="how to disassemble a laptop" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/32a/863/0e9/32a8630e9747496655dccc7dba2b3563.jpg"><br><br>  This is how we completely disassembled the Dell Inspiron 1525 laptop. In order to assemble it back, it is enough to go through all the steps in reverse order, no difficulties should arise.  The only thing you need is not to confuse the screws, for this you can memorize in advance which one where did you twist it, or lay out in separate piles. <br><br>  Let's try to sum up a certain result. <br><br>  Pros: <br>  - a large selection of colors; <br>  - a wide range of configurations; <br>  - the possibility of upgrading through 3m pci-e slots, a connector for a SIM card and a place for bluetooth; <br>  - Wi-Fi Catcher function, allows you to detect a wireless network signal without turning on the power of the computer; <br>  - a wide range of ports (hdmi, s-video, IrDA, ExpressCard, etc.) <br>  Unworthiness: <br>  - design "on the fan"; <br>  - short battery life; <br>  ... <br><br>  Actually the advantages and disadvantages of a thing is purely subjective, and it is not worth discussing it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/53477/">https://habr.com/ru/post/53477/</a></p>
