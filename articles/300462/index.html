Honestly, the time flew by quite unnoticed.  But if you look back and look at the results of the past months, you realize that we could really do a lot.  When you see that your playground is running continuously, the mood rises! <br><br>  <b>First steps in the region</b> <br><br>  Armor went almost immediately after opening: from the second week of work.  At the same time, the first residents began to appear.  Although the workload of all sites was minimal, we showed financial results.  Toward the end of November there was a pre-New Year boom, one might say: customers came and came. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We felt a significant impact in February, making a mixture of paid and free events.  It was a productive partnership with Denis Zatsepin, the head of Media School.  ‚ÄúMedia School‚Äù functioned in parallel with other events, there were days when the movement was from morning to evening.  And it is noteworthy that this did not prevent our residents, which also increased.  Thanks to this partnership, a large number of people learned about us - we gave an excellent information wave!

We carried out activities not only in our coworking, but also in other venues.  For example, they became partners of the Samara Business Development Platform Forum, which was held at Expo Volga.  There we talked about how coworking helps minimize costs.  For example, when a large company sends its employee to the region, it is more profitable to pay not a whole office, but a separate equipped workplace.  Work began with a new audience: occupancy increased to 80%. <br>  Due to the throughput system of BC Tower from the moment our site was opened, we keep statistics on visits.  For 4 months we had more than two thousand visitors, and at the moment - even more.  And this is without staff.  Seriously! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/87b/a86/15c/87ba8615cf1f8bc6a01f86f3b65b9a0b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Inhabitants</b> <br><br>  If we are asked who your client is and ask him to describe - age group, type of activity - we will not be able to give an exact answer. <br><br>  Both men and girls come to work for us - of all ages.  If we talk about the professional activities of visitors, then most of them are IT entrepreneurs.  It so happened that people in this area are pulling into coworking.  There is one proverb: a fisherman sees a fisherman from afar.  Our residents are such ‚Äúfishermen‚Äù.  First, he sits fishing on his laptop, and then creates a small community around him. <br>  But, of course, the activities of our clients are not limited to the IT field.  For example, two of our residents have created a project related to the production of blinkfangs (note the design with the display, which is broadcast video to attract attention).  In addition, some of the clients are employees of our business center who do not have their own negotiation or lecture hall. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/119/701/d3c/119701d3c83db594cd27b4022f84ec3b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There are even foreigners among co-working residents.  We have a Frenchman who has been living in Samara for two years and is engaged in teaching.  He even wrote an article about us in French!  But what is interesting, almost all of us work with foreign companies.  In general, our visitors are active and promising people.  They have a clear understanding of what needs to be done to achieve the goal. <br><br>  <b>Atmosphere</b> <br><br>  In words it is difficult to describe what atmosphere prevails in coworking.  You just need to come and plunge into it.  But if in two words: democratic and business.  Communication in coworking on "you", everyone knows each other. <br>  Visitors generally sit at their laptops, taking short breaks;  someone can leave for an hour and then come back.  A break at a time that is convenient for you is one of the advantages of coworking.  Each of the residents chooses for themselves the effective time of work.  They know not only what to do, but WHEN to do it.  This is what distinguishes them from ordinary employees who come to the office and sit at the prescribed eight hours.  A person must work for the result. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/044/ae7/9ee/044ae79ee4d8c5d17fe2c593b3b31f8a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>First problems</b> <br><br>  Of course, not everything is so smooth.  Our first disturbances were connected with residents: a person often worked with us for a month, everything was great, but then he left, saying that he was not ready to constantly pay money for renting working space.  And we did not know what to do: the attraction mechanisms were involved, but the demand in Samara was not yet fully formed.  Then, of course, new people came to the place of the retired people, and everything began to get better. <br><br>  At the moment, we have 14 permanent residents.  In addition, we are currently negotiating with two companies that want to place their employees in our coworking - about 8 people. <br>  Work on coworking is ongoing, we are trying to improve.  But coworking is still unusual for a province, so we cannot predict demand. <br><br>  <b>Perspectives</b> <br><br>  Ahead of the summer - a special time, when the mood of all non-working and thought only about the holidays.  During this period, a reduced demand among residents is expected, so we will focus on the meeting room and lecture hall - we will promote them.  We also plan to perform on the youth form ‚ÄúiVolga‚Äù on the shifts ‚ÄúLittle Homeland‚Äù and ‚ÄúMedia Wave‚Äù.  We hope that we will survive the summer with the same success rates as in February or March. <br><br>  If we talk about global plans, then, first of all, it is to fill coworking with a sufficiently large number of residents.  Work and develop the project.  When this goal is achieved, it will be possible to think about expansion. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/ccf/6e1/366/ccf6e136668f92ca54cf027e7eaa8b2a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  _____ <br>  We are always open to the client, focused on his interests.  We are constantly improving and moving forward.  If this is not done (taking into account that this is a new area for Samara), then the demand will be small.  But when new and new people come and, most importantly, they are satisfied - this is good news! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300462/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300462/</a></p>
