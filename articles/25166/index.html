  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ubuntu to Toshiba: pitfalls</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Technical part under the cut. <br>  The desire to put Ubuntu on your machine arose a month after buying a laptop.  Black and gray Toshiba A200 13O was bought so to speak out of love, and not according to the calculation.  It all began with the murder of the vista that was on board, which was eliminated for some subjective reasons and due to programmatic brightness adjustment.  It was installed from the site of the bios producer under the pig (under Vista on the site of its bios, under Khryushu-its).  Appeared hardware brightness control and TP.  But after not very comfortable, but pleasant-looking beauties under Vista, on Khryusha it was quite dull to work.  Still hunting to go ahead.  And I also wanted not to take a steam bath with the virus - to come to the office with a laptop with linux and not to think that when servicing you can infect a handful of Windows-type machines with projects, which in monetary terms will bring the office a sickly loss. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The first time I crammed on a typewriter 7.10.  I played, but I could not adjust it so that when connecting the ears, the built-in speakers were cut down.  I waited for 8.04 - the problem did not go away, but I did not want to retreat.  Not right away, but by assembling als by a specialist for HDA Intel, profanity, <strong>options options snd-hda-intel model = lenovo</strong> in <strong>/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base</strong> managed to get them to function normally.  And then after the reboot, you need to transfer the plug. <br><br>  Soon it turned out that in order for bluetooth to function, it was necessary to load the Windows so that it would cut down the device, and then reboot into ubuntu, which, naturally, was absolutely worthless.  Started digging.  It turned out that it must be cut in manually with the command <strong>sudo toshset-bluetooth on</strong> .  But then it all started.  An error emerged that the kernel does not hold my Toshiba: <strong>required kernel toshiba support not enabled</strong> .  This is a Ubunt where my toshset defaults ... When I tried to load the <strong>toshiba_acpi</strong> module, I <strong>got</strong> <strong>no such device</strong> .

      It is now possible to systematize everything in a pair of sentences and indicate that bluetooth does not work due to problems with ACPI.  But to come to this conclusion, it took a long time .. <br><br>  It was here that I remembered how, on one of the evenings after several sleeping modes, my Toshiba, under ubuntoy, <strong>almost burnt, as I simply didn‚Äôt get a (!) Fan</strong> .  That's where the problems with ACPI fit into the course of events.  For the same <strong>toshset</strong> allows you to work with a fan.  Naturally, <strong>fnfxd</strong> could not <strong>speak</strong> without loading the <strong>toshiba_acpi</strong> module. <br><br>  There was a question - why the module is not loaded?  It begs that the system does not see Toshiba in the laptop.  After certain thoughts and wanderings, no idea was born. <br><br>  Bios <br><br>  <s>We need a native bios ... that was in the database from the factory.</s>  By the way, the other day I discovered that the Ubuntu site now <a href="http://webapps.ubuntu.com/certification/list/%3Fsearch%3Dtoshiba">states</a> that Toshiba A200 is compatible (?) From 7.10 and 8.04. <br><br>  Those bios may well be involved in the commotion ... I downloaded the bios under whist.  Well, let us omit that they have there the auto installer of the BIOS from the Windows hard-coded path of the Windows on the C drive (I have it on E) - I overcame it with the help of manipulations.  Duck there also turned out to be a phoenix, too, even if it was turned under whist ... And then I killed my own kada with a pig. <br><br>  Here are the things here.  And I like Ubuntu so much)) Although I sometimes get to hang it under zero. <br><br>  <s><strong>PS:</strong> would get backup factory bios toshiba a200 13o =)</s> <br><br>  <strong>upd0:</strong> <br><blockquote>  sudo toshset -bluetooth on <br>  required kernel toshiba support not enabled. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  sudo modprobe toshiba_acpi <br>  FATAL: Error inserting toshiba_acpi (/lib/modules/2.6.24-16-generic/kernel/drivers/acpi/toshiba_acpi.ko): No such device </blockquote><br><br>  did the same for <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/krig/" class="user_link">krig krig</a> : <br><blockquote>  dmesg <br>  ... <br>  sudo modprobe toshiba <br>  ... <br>  dmesg <br>  ... not a supported Toshiba laptop </blockquote><br><blockquote>  lshw <br>  ... <br>  description: Notebook <br>  product: Satellite A200 <br>  vendor: TOSHIBA <br>  version: PSAE0E-00Y019RU <br>  ... </blockquote><br><br>  <b>upd1:</b> <br>  in the course of the discussion they found out that the native bios does not solve the problem <br><br>  <b>upd2:</b> <br>  Apparently, the problem is that toshset does not work with toshiba'mi on phoenix'ovskih bios <br><br>  set omnibook: <br><br>  <b>sudo apt-get install subversion build-essential linux-source linux-headers-generic</b> <br>  <b>svn co <a href="https://omnibook.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/omnibook/omnibook/trunk">omnibook.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/omnibook/omnibook/trunk</a></b> <br>  <b>cd trunk</b> <br>  <b>make &amp;&amp; sudo make install</b> <br>  <b>sudo make load</b> <br>  add omnibook to <b>/ etc / modules</b> <br>  <b>gedit /etc/modprobe.d/omnibook</b> <br>  there we push <b>options omnibook ectype = 12 userset = 1</b> <br><br>  bluetooth now works <br>  I have a BIOS under XP <br><br>  There was a problem with sleep modes - after the resumption of work, the cooling fan of the probe is not cut, the bluetooth and tp die off. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/25166/">https://habr.com/ru/post/25166/</a></p>
