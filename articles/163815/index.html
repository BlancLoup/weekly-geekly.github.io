Among these initiatives are new advanced training courses and resources for IT specialists, teaching and technical and technical materials for university professors, as well as expanded educational programs that provide students with direct participation in solving real business problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1b2/88b/ce1/1b288bce17863c79f1d7c2f8e1c94f1d.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9ee/7b5/13f/9ee7b513f7207b3ae08e46e3b160e9f6.jpg" align="right">  These capabilities will help solve the problem of a severe shortage of human resources described in the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/techtrends/%3Flang%3Dru">IBM 2012 Tech Trends Report</a> .  The report, compiled by the division of <a href="http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/centerforappliedinsights/overview/">IBM Center for Applied Insights</a> , notes that only one out of ten organizations has qualified specialists who are necessary to introduce new technologies: business intelligence, mobile and cloud computing, and social business.  In addition, almost half of the students and teachers surveyed during the survey believe that their educational institutions have serious problems in meeting the growing market demand for qualified specialists in the field of modern technology. <br><br>

    <br><h5>  <b>New curricula, technical materials and advanced training courses for teachers</b> </h5><br>  The United States <a href="http://www.bls.gov/">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> ( <a href="http://www.bls.gov/">US Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> ) estimates that in the United States alone, the number of IT jobs will increase by 22% by 2020.  In an effort to help educators better prepare students for the realization of this potential, IBM has introduced the largest expansion of its <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/university/academic/pub/page/academic_initiative">Academic Initiative</a> since its launch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d15/a15/5c0/d15a155c0bef054444f4583d3c0d0442.jpg"><br><br>  For the first time within the framework of the Academic Initiative, IBM will be offered access to curricula and refresher courses on IT security to help students gain the necessary knowledge and skills on modern means of protection against IT threats.  Security issues are considered one of the two main obstacles to the widespread adoption of advanced technologies, but also one of the key areas of employment growth.  The number of information security specialists is expected to nearly double by 2015. <br><br>  IBM‚Äôs new security offerings include: <br><br><ul><li>  A pre-prepared curriculum based on real-life IT security scenarios that will help students better understand the existing problems facing enterprises and conduct an in-depth analysis of the trends identified and described <a href="https://www-935.ibm.com/services/us/iss/xforce/trendreports/">in the X-Force report</a> . </li><li>  Free access to IT security software that teachers can use to teach students how to test applications, as well as test networks and virtual servers for vulnerabilities.  Teachers and students can remotely connect to the latest <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/ru/z/index.html">zEnterprise mainframe</a> , a secure system that can be used to prepare students for solving real-world problems using corporate IT skills. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/297/ea0/624/297ea06244e10e7da0afdc99eb4ad87a.jpg" align="right">  The ability to provide access to the latest enterprise-level technology directly in classrooms at no extra charge is extremely important for acquiring skills.  In addition to resources in the field of information security, IBM now provides software licenses and materials for self-study in the following areas: <br><br><ul><li>  Big Data and Analytics - Teachers can now use the software to work with <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/bigdata/">Big Data</a> in the classroom by accessing IBM's various offerings to process Big Data.  <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/infosphere/hadoop/">Hadoop-</a> based e-books and learning modules are also available for students studying business disciplines and computer science. </li><li>  Commerce - Teachers can now use digital marketing and analytics software in the learning process that IBM offers as part of the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/ru/ru/smarter_commerce/overview/index.html">Smart Commerce</a> initiative.  With the help of a series of training modules, students will be able to study such topics as conducting comparative assessment tests (benchmarking), as well as learn how to develop software code to identify patterns of consumer behavior. </li><li>  Mobile Computing - New training modules based on HTLM 5 and DOJO are preparing students to develop mobile applications.  Teachers can also download IBM mobile application development software to give students more practical opportunities. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3ca/e73/c80/3cae73c8010db021b716b27e4a4ad138.jpg" align="left">  Helping faculty members develop skills in the field of modern technology, IBM today introduced the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/065eaf68-e1e1-409e-9826-75575a1a3d09/%3Flang%3Dru">Knowledge Exchange</a> .
