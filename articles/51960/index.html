  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Web Surfers Challenges</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Ten years ago, when the Internet was a curiosity, I cheated by participating in various TV and radio quiz shows using my access to the network.  That is, I did not know the answers to the questions, but simply very quickly knew how to find them on the Internet.  Which allowed me to win movie tickets a couple of times, a couple of books and CDs, and appear once on local television.  All these skills were useful in life - and now, at the request of friends, I find what I need on the Net.  "If it is on the Internet, I tell them, I will find it for you."  However, do not consider it for bragging.  I am sure that many people are able to quickly find any required information. <br>  And in connection with this, I thought somehow: why not make clever puzzles in the style of, say, ‚ÄúYour game‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat?  Where?  When? ‚Äù, But especially for those who love and know how to search on the Internet. <br>  And I began to write such puzzles.  Some of my friends didn‚Äôt like them at all, someone scratched their turnips and stopped in the middle of the way.  And someone liked it, and they spent a few minutes (or hours) of their precious time solving these puzzles. <br>  If you have free time, you have the skills to search for information and you want to try your hand - try to solve several such tasks. <br>  All you need is basic knowledge, Google, Wikipedia and your other favorite sources of information. <br>  Problems can be solved immediately from the tail, lowering the beginning.  I would recommend to solve all the same sequentially, from beginning to end.  Then guessing may be more interesting.  Because here the goal is not speed and not the accuracy of only the final word, but the disclosure of the whole chain. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  We kindly request for those who solve puzzles - do not write answers in your comments :-)

    <h4>  Task number 1 </h4><br>  He ridiculously wanted a woman on the phone, and all the while he sang a funny song in his own language.  The first word in the chorus of this song, if you change the stress (and the last letter), will become the regional center of Russia.  Expand the name of the city backwards and remove the last letter, you will get the name of one well-known trademark.  The manufacturer of this brand is based in a certain country, whose symbol will indicate the plant.  Rearrange the letters in the middle of the received name of the plant and add the letter that is in the end of both polar terms, meaning the most powerful human feelings.  You will receive the name of the city, which is located in a country where another well-known trademark is produced (but in a different area), whose name is consonant with a certain category of household goods.  Count the number of similar elements in the emblem of this trademark and multiply this number by itself.  Turn the numbers in this number, and from the number obtained, subtract a quarter of the number of similar elements in the emblem.  To this new number add the number of letters that make up the name of that regional center.  The resulting number will mean the year of the last century, in which the famous Russian poet died exactly on the world's most famous independence day of one of the countries.  This poet is known for his translations into Russian of many works of the world and his own works, including a fairy tale, the title of which uses a number that can again mean the year of the last century, in which one important and terrible event took place that shook the whole world.  Name the most famous work of that famous artist who has the same name as the person who played the main role in the grand production of this event. <br><br><h4>  Problem number 2 </h4><br>  First look at the worldwide sign of mercy.  Think about what you can do with it, and use it as a letter without adding or subtracting elements in this icon.  Take what unites the legendary author of the most famous stories about the future, or the role of the most famous Gascon, or the performer of the most spectacular pop smash of the past about the dead and werewolves, and also the name of the one who came up with the most touching story about the old loser and his battle with the imaginary and also remember the name of that ruler of the collapsed empire, which was the first and the last in this incarnation ... And then use the same first letter of the sign that you find in all five cases, as if slightly different, but still very  It seems these features are not sounded.  Duplicate this letter and remove it alphabetically by the end to as many places as you find in the name of a famous and once-existing rock band, named after a large predatory animal, whose founder and guitarist tragically died on the scene.  And also take the letter with which the name of the national group begins, which gave the world an album, the name of which includes the numeral and the profession of a defender who protects not people.  Arrange the received symbols to make the word familiar to you.  Use your knowledge or vocabulary and translate the word into Canberra and Plymouth.  Learn in the resulting word a new meaning: some kind of action.  Remember who could, in a different guise, carry out this action.  Remember also that he always needed everything in the world, for which he was and was not.  Reflect and find the most appropriate and widespread rhyme to the resulting word, meaning this very need.  And now remember the time period bearing the same name as the romantic story, which was popular more than half a century ago, in which the legendary person, named like the specified word-rhyme, shone from two sides at once. <br><br><h4>  Task number 3 </h4><br>  The famous son of the Turkish citizen pestering the underground millionaire with notes, offering to ship citrus barrels, and signing in the name of the heroes of the eponymous novel of the famous Russian writer.  In the title of another famous novel by this writer there are as many letters as there are sharps in one scale.  The protagonist of this novel wore a surname, which included the word for a mammal.  And there are fewer letters in this word than in the name of the main character, exactly the number that will be obtained by subtracting the number of days in the shortest winter month from the number of days in the shortest summer month of the usual year.  Take the last letter of this mammal name and flip along the horizontal axis.  Assign the resulting letter number 1. Again, go back to the word meaning a mammal.  Take the first letter in the name of a mammal and move alphabetically by the number of steps you can get if you subtract from the number of letters in the same name of the main character of the novel of the famous writer the number of letters in the name of the novel about this character.  Assign the received letter number 2. Take the first letter in the name of the beloved child of the participant in the adventure, led by the famous son of the Turkish citizen, and the knowledge of the animal world of that part of the world where the Nile River flows will help you.  Assign the received letter number 3. Again return to the name of the mammal.  Remember the main antagonist of this animal, and take from it the first letter.  Give it the number 4. Now copy the letter # 3 and put it at the beginning and at the end of a new word.  Put the letter # 1 before the last one, and the letter # 2 after the first one.  The letter # 4 make the third in a row.  After it, put the clone of the letter # 3 again.  And you get the name of one city.  Now replace the fourth letter in the word with a bagel, removing the same letter at the end.  Having written the received word twice, you will easily recognize that short word between them that I had in mind. <br><br>  <i>And finally, the most difficult task for today.</i>  <i>No one and my friends could cope with it yet.</i>  <i>Maybe you will have it in the teeth?</i> <br><br><h4>  Task number 4 </h4><br>  ... It was a great year.  When the metal on the tree connected the two great waters.  And when two brothers from a distant northern country built the prototype of the greatest device from the same tree and metal, which will determine the future a century later. <br>  And it was a tragic year.  When the great commander died, in whose honor several ships and the whole lake were named, and which ordinary people called the father-benefactor.  And when that ruler died, in which the war was shamefully lost, in which that commander participated, whose name was the same as that of the father of the ruler.  And in that year, the greatest researcher of numbers did not become, whose name is one of the most popular methods of influencing images. <br>  ... We will take the first digit of that year and remember the letter in the alphabet with such a serial number.  Then take the second digit, put the first digit in front of it and again remember the letter in the alphabet.  Now let's do the same with the third digit, putting the first digit in front of it.  And for the fourth time, double the first digit before putting after it the fourth digit of the year.  Copy one of the letters to make five letters.  Rearranging these letters, as we like, we find the word, which is the work of a famous writer, who died so many years before that wonderful and tragic year, which is obtained by doubling the number, which is obtained by adding the numbers that double the number consists of. <br>  ... Take this new word of five letters and replace one of the copied letters with a new letter that looks like a geometric shape.  And then again we shuffle letters, having received a new word from five letters.  Also the name is strange, foreign.  The servant owning what has this name was called similar to the name of a fragrant spring flower, which is considered the national flower of the country, where a cruel ruler who was dearly loved by his people lived for a long time, who had many names, one of which meant literally - the third child named Stone.  And the owner of the property itself was often called exactly the same thing as the object, which is a necessary thing for any self-respecting adventurer, if he needed the means to take his life. <br>  ... So if you take the name of this subject, and forget about the first two letters of this word, you get a new word that should be read from the end.  And now we need to replace the first letter in the first letter from the name of that spring fragrant flower, and we get a part of the old name of the city located in the country where a cruel ruler with many names ruled for a long time.  And this city belonged to many countries, including the country in which at that time the descendant of the ruler, who died in the indicated at the very beginning of the year, and bore the exact same name, ruled.  But exactly one hundred years after that very year, the city had forever remained the country of the spring flower. <br>  ... And if you take the second half of the old name of this city, you get the name of one legendary ruler.  From this name you should take as many first letters as carbon atoms in a fragrant dweller of hardware stores, which is the simplest representative of a class of substances whose name is similar to the name of valuable commercial fish from distant seas, whose meat has a shade of color that is present on the flag of a small European country who gave the world the one who dreams crossed a fish with a man and took his leg away from a fearless metal warrior.  And so, taking these first letters of the name of the legendary ruler, you should insert in front of the last letter the letter that will stand at the beginning of a meek word, meaning the largest of the living, whose tail is turned across.  And then at the very end you should add the second letter from this short word.  It will be easy to guess what the word should be, and add the missing letters at the end. <br>  ... And then you can easily give the name of the imaginary center, which is found in what the resulting word means. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51960/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51960/</a></p>
