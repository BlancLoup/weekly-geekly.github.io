      The first QS report on the return of investment in the European <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/%3Fmode%3Dabout">Full-Time MBA</a> program in 2015, which was published on January 23 at <a href="http://www.topmba.com/">www.TopMBA.com</a> , shows that the 46 leading European full-time MBA programs reviewed in the study are characterized by a very high return on investment . <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Main conclusions</font> </h2><br>  ‚Ä¢ For employers, a full-time MBA program is more valuable than other qualifications.  The average salary of a graduate of the European MBA program is $ 91,586 compared to $ 45,500 for graduates of <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/education/magistratura-za-rubezhom-shag-za-shagom/">master's programs</a> .  The average salary of MBA graduates in the financial sector and banking services is $ 95,050, compared with the salary of $ 53,127 graduates of the master's program.  The average salary of MBA graduates in consulting is $ 88,250, compared with $ 47,228 for graduate students. <br><br>  Julie Koffman, chairman of the World Women's Leadership at Bain &amp; Company, says, " <i>We are going to hire over 400 MBA graduates this year. We need to hire talents to support our growth</i> ." <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Europe, with a predominant number of annual programs and high salaries, boasts the highest return on investment in MBA in 10 years.  The average European program in 10 years is $ 0.67 million. 20 years after the end, the average return on investment of a graduate of the European MBA program is $ 2.9 million. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The sustained position of the Full ‚ÄìTime MBA in Europe is supported by the fact that, on average, 85% of graduates get a job within three months after graduation, and most international graduates meet the requirements of a visa and can stay in the region. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ In all, 20 business schools in Europe showed a graduate return on investment of $ 3 million or more in 20 years, including: IE, IESE, ESADE and ESIC in Spain;  INSEAD, HEC Paris and EDHEC in France;  IMD and St.  Gallen in Switzerland;  Cambridge, Cranfield, Imperial, London Business School, Oxford and Warwick in the UK;  Copenhagen Business School in Denmark;  Mannheim and WHU in Germany;  SDA Bocconi in Italy, and RSM in the Netherlands. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ MBA graduates in Europe, on average, can recoup their investments in a business school in just 30 months.  In some European schools, graduates recoup their investments in 20 months or less: ESIC (15), Bath (16), Edinburgh (17), Strathclyde (17), Mannheim (19), Durham (20 months). <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Salary growth after MBA in Europe averages 85%, increasing from $ 50,226 to $ 91,586 after graduation. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Graduates from 12 European business schools increase salaries by more than 90%.  Vlerick has the highest rates (155%), St.  Gallen (150%), University of Edinburgh (146%), ESMT (145%), European University (138%), HHL Leipzig (127%), MIB (114%), HEC Paris (112%), Durham (111 %), Bath (110%), EMLYON (110%) and London Business School (107%). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a36/a92/be1/a36a92be16f24f7da61756074be615d5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Nunzio Quacvarelli, co-author <a href="http://www.topmba.com/why-mba/publications/qs-european-business-school-roi-report">of the QS return on investment</a> in the European Full-Time MBA program in 2015, says: " <i>This is the first report prepared by QS experts to give applicants for MBA programs clarity on the expected return on investment, which is most likely to be achieved by full-time MBA programs at a recognizable European business school. Further, QS will take into account the number of entrepreneurs and business leaders from each business school whose preparation is their fundamental value</i> . " <br><br>  <i>We remind you that in order to enter the full-time MBA programs, it is required to pass the GMAT / GRE, IELTS / TOEFL tests.</i>  <i>We recommend to get acquainted with the articles in <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/tests/">our blog</a> on the topic of test preparation.</i> <br><br>  The author of the article is Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/284016/">https://habr.com/ru/post/284016/</a></p>
