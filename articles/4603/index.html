  <section class="page js-page"><h1>For the virtual "Sotovik" the real battle began</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, the domain name <a href="http://www.sotovik.ru/">sotovik.ru has</a> twice changed its owner, although the site itself has not undergone any visible changes.  The reason for what was happening was the conflict (see the habrashema <a href="">‚Äú</a> Power Alignment <a href="">around Sotovik‚Äù</a> ) between Sotovik Information and Analytical Agency (Sotovik IAA), which still controlled this resource, and the new structure with the similar name Sotovik Information Agency (IA "Sotovik").  The first of these companies is headed by Viktor Strizhak, who was responsible for the operational management of Sotovik since the beginning of 2005.  Behind the clone company, the Sotovik news agency, stands Karina Novikova, who in 2003-04, together with her then-husband Dmitry Kalashnikov, <a href="http://www.ournokia.ru/news/%3F%26id%3D3106%26t%3D2%26d%3D">already controlled Sotovik</a> . <br><br>  The site was managed by the Sotovik IAA under an agreement with the owner of the corresponding domain and trademark, Yusar organization.  Since its inception in 2004, shares in ‚ÄúYusar‚Äù have been distributed between unknown persons on the market: Inna Smolkova (75%) and Ekaterina Arkova (25%).  At the beginning of this year, Ms. Smolkova transferred her share to Larisa Novikova.  In September, the new owner initiated the removal of the director general of Yusar, Mr. Stryzhak, and the election of her daughter Karina to this position.  Since Mr. Strizhak continued to lead the Sotovik IAA, the contract with this organization was terminated, and management was transferred to the Sotovik IA. <br><br>  However, Ms. Novikova was unable to begin her duties.  According to her, the technical director of Sotovik, Andrei Myagkov, was abducted, who later informed relatives about the transfer of all passwords from the site management to Strizhak.  Then Ms. Novikova discovered that without the necessary decision of the Yusara participants, a new version of the company's charter was registered, according to which the 100% of its participants must be agreed to (instead of 2/3, as it was before).  Since the change of management was not supported by Ms. Arkova, the tax inspectorate re-registered as general director Stryzhak.

      The accusations against Stryzhak are denied by the lawyer of IAA Sotovik and Yusar Vyacheslav Chekhovskaya.  ‚ÄúThe acquisition of 75% of the limited liability company (LLC) Yusar was carried out in violation of the preemptive rights of Ms. Arkova, who is now challenging this deal in the Moscow Arbitration Court,‚Äù said Mr. Chekhovskaya.  ‚ÄúNot being able to become a legitimate general director, Karina Novikova resorted to a tried and tested raidrean method: she began the procedure for liquidating Yusara, and her mother became the liquidator.  Then Novikova Sr. refused to liquidate and appointed Novikova Jr. as the General Director.  After receiving the opportunity to manage the domain, Novikova moved the site to their own servers, updated it independently within a few weeks and offered advertisers to renew the contract for her company. ‚Äù <br><br>  Denies Mr. Chekhov and the fact of the abduction of Andrei Myagkov.  ‚ÄúIn fact, Ms. Novikova seriously intimidated him, but after giving him security guarantees, he returned to our company,‚Äù explained the lawyer.  - Generally, if Mrs. Novikova were right, she would have appealed to the court, but so far all the lawsuits on this dispute have been initiated by our side.  Moreover, we found on a number of documents submitted to Novikova a fake of Arkova‚Äôs signatures, and therefore a criminal case was initiated. ‚Äù <br><br>  At the moment, the site has returned to the previous servers, and Mr. Strizhak again manages the domain.  He also assumed the duties of the editor-in-chief of Sotovik.  The publication itself continues its work, although several of its leaders, who are now creating a new edition, have passed to Mrs. Novikova.  At the same time, Karina Novikova leaves no hope of gaining control over the Sotovik.  ‚ÄúWe are confident that the authorities will take the side of the rightful owner, not the raiders, who are ready to seize the company by any means,‚Äù she said. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4603/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4603/</a></p>
