  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New Yandex.Store - what, why and why</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today it became known that Yandex is launching its own Android application store.  We asked Alexander Zverev, the manager of the Yandex.Store service, to answer a few questions for Habr's readers and our site App2Top.ru.  For example, how they plan to compete with Google Play, how much interest they will give to developers and whether there will be any advantages for content creators from Russia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d96/ef2/d91/d96ef2d9126912df2ae85f91c90b60f3.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Why did Yandex decide to start creating its own mobile app store? </h5><br>  This is a logical step for our mobile ecosystem - a set of applications that solve basic user tasks.  We already have a mobile search, there are mobile maps, we provide a cloud service and a shell for the Android interface.  The only thing missing was the own app store.

    <h5>  Some time ago you introduced your own shell for Android, now here‚Äôs your own store, is it worth waiting for you in the foreseeable future of the original OS? </h5><br>  So far, Android seems to us to be a completely open and promising system, which makes it possible to create alternative services. <br><br><h5>  Why does the Android platform need another stop?  After all, it often happens that users simply do not notice stor, trying to compete with GooglePlay.  How did you solve this problem? </h5><br>  They do not notice those stor, which compete in the free market.  Let's just say: users do not notice the second stor, even if they belong to serious brands.  And this is due to the fact that the user doesn‚Äôt have any needs in the additional application store: if both pages are good, then they will have the same content and there‚Äôs no point in using both.  And we focus on manufacturers of devices and mobile operators, who will preinstall Yandex.Store as the only application store.  And so the question of the struggle for the user will be transferred to the sphere of competition between devices. <br><br>  Yandex is one of the few companies that can offer users, at least in our local markets, a complete ecosystem: as I said, these are Search, Maps, cloud services, Mail and now the Android market. <br><br><h5>  What type of devices will you focus on - tablets or smartphones? </h5><br>  We already have an agreement with the manufacturers of the three tablets.  And we see that the market is interested in our product.  In general, Yandex.Store will be universal, we will try to make it so that you can install it and find suitable applications for any Android device. <br><br><h5>  What do the partners get from this company?  For example, a megaphone? </h5><br>  We share profits with them, for them it is an opportunity to earn money from the content.  And, besides, it is an opportunity to provide our customers with good localized services. <br><br><h5>  What is the advantage of Yandex.Store smartphones for users? </h5><br>  At least, in these services.  They will be better than all analogues, at least in local markets - for sure. <br><br>  In general, for us this is the first product that we will immediately launch ‚Äúfor the whole world‚Äù.  Today we are announcing it in Moscow, at our conference, and tomorrow at AppsWorld in London. <br><br><h5>  At the moment, you have entered into a licensing agreement with Opera for 40 thousand applications.  How else do you plan to increase your application portfolio?  Will Russian developers have priority on entering Yandex.Store with their own applications? </h5><br>  There will be no preferences.  I very much want the public to perceive Yandex.Store not as a Russian, but as a great international history. <br><br>  As for attracting developers, that is why we gave them the opportunity today at the conference to work with the alpha version, leave their feedback - we want to take into account their wishes.  And tomorrow in London we will also communicate.  Of course, later we will take part in various events, organize master classes, etc.  We can tell a lot of interesting things to developers from a technical point of view.  But the main idea is to make adding an application in Yandex.Store as simple as possible: they need to spend only 5-7 minutes to get another sales channel for their product. <br><br><h5>  How many languages ‚Äã‚Äãdoes Yandex.Store support? </h5><br>  At the start there will be two languages ‚Äã‚Äã- Russian and English, but in the future we will localize it to others. <br><br><h5>  Do we understand correctly that soon, for example, in the USA it will be possible to buy an Android-smartphone with a pre-installed application store from Yandex? </h5><br>  We hope that this will happen :).  To do this, we will need to negotiate with the relevant foreign vendors, and we will be happy to do that.  In Russia, agreements with several manufacturers of devices already exist, for many partners this is interesting and beneficial. <br><br><h5>  How much interest will you take from profits? </h5><br>  As much as all the rest - 30%.  At the same time, regardless of the type of payment (and we want to immediately support mobile commerce, which allows you to debit money from your mobile phone account), the final cost will be the same for the user, and the amount of profit for developers.  That is, the developer always gets his 70%, and the remaining 30% are shared between us, the partner and the billing. <br><br><h5>  How will the upruva process take place? </h5><br>  We start with basic stories: post-moderation, community posts.  In general, there are many ideas on how the process can be improved - in the future we plan to implement them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153045/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153045/</a></p>
