      Today, the average sleep time is 6 hours and 45 minutes, and a hundred years earlier it was 9 hours.  Our ancestors went to bed at sunset and woke up at dawn, so sometimes their sleep reached 11 hours. <br><br>  Today, to sleep 8 hours is already a rarity - electricity, Internet and television are doing their job. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Why sleep is important:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  In the dream, our body is restored and regenerates. <br><br></li><li>  In a dream, a growth hormone is produced - <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD_%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0">somatotropin</a> . <br><br></li><li>  Sleep is important for the normal functioning of the immune system. <br><br></li><li>  In case of incomplete sleep, there is a tendency to gain excess weight - this is due to the hormone <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BF%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD">leptin</a> , an overwhelming appetite, produced during sleep. <br></li></ol><br><h1>  How to find time to sleep </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1bc/e9c/c2d/1bce9cc2dad3a9aed962e96312f9c30f.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Due to the high rhythm of modern life, it‚Äôs not always possible to find eight hours of sleep.  Perhaps the adoption of two factors will help you: <br><br><ol><li>  <b>All cases do not alter.</b> <br>  It is impossible to be in time everywhere, the more things are done, the more new ones appear.  This is an endless loop. <br><br>  However, efficiency is affected not only by the time that is allocated for work, but also by the state in which it is performed - due to excessive fatigue, attention and concentration fall, more errors are allowed, which means you have to spend extra time on correcting them. <br><br>  Allowing yourself to get enough sleep, you will improve your health and health, as well as begin to get more pleasure from life and work.  Believe me, it's worth it! <br><br></li><li>  <b>Do something that is fun, and forget about the rest.</b> <br>  Make a to-do list for which time is spent at work and at home.  Let it consist of two columns - something that is enjoyable and pleasant to do, and what you don't want to do, but it is necessary because of a sense of duty.  Begin to refuse cases from the second column, unless, of course, the refusal does not lead to your arrest or dismissal, and soon you will understand how great it is to allow yourself to do what you want, and not what you supposedly should. <br><br>  After a couple of weeks, you will have extra time not only for sleeping, but also for yourself and your family, as well as hobbies and hobbies. <br></li></ol><br><h1>  Sleep hygiene </h1><br><h3>  Here are some tips to help improve your sleep hygiene: </h3><br>  Do not consume caffeine after 4 PM and limit alcohol before bedtime.  It is better to drink a soothing herbal tea. <br><br>  If reading or watching a video helps you sleep better, use it.  Also, taking a hot bath before bed and maintaining a cool temperature in the bedroom will improve the quality of sleep. <br><br>  Train yourself not to solve problems or work issues in bed.  For this, it is best to use a dedicated workplace. <br><br>  If you can not sleep because of the many thoughts in my head, then try to think about something pleasant.  If this does not help, make a list and put it off until the morning, repeat as necessary, if necessary. <br><br><hr><h3>  How to deal with the to-do list </h3><br>  Divide the list from the list into three columns: in the first - problems and projects, in the second - everything that can be done to solve them, in the third - cases that you want to do.  Usually in the third column the lowest points. <br><br>  Leave the first two columns to chance, and you will see that many of them are solved by yourself, without your participation. <br><br>  It is important to remember that no one will be able to redo all the cases, so do what you want and it will be what is really important for you. <br><br><hr><br><h1>  Natural sleeping pills </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/49b/d5f/ddc/49bd5fddca9bbda462f21ebbc9f9c47b.jpg" alt="image">  <i>Meet this some kind of lettuce there, perhaps wild.</i> <br><br><h3>  Important: Although most natural hypnotics do not have a sedative effect, be careful and consult a doctor! </h3><br>  <b>Santianin (Suntheanine)</b> <br>  Tianine is an amino acid found in green tea leaves.

Because of this, the level of oxygen in the blood falls and the brain receives a signal of suffocation, after which it sends an impulse to open the airways. <br><br>  Usually, people suffering from SOA are not aware of what happened, but they experience side effects: <br><br><ul><li>  Disturbed deep sleep. <br></li><li>  Permanent reductions in the level of oxygen in the blood cause morning drowsiness, a decrease in concentration, and can lead to sharp mood changes throughout the day. <br></li><li>  Increased blood pressure. <br></li></ul><br><h3>  Causes of sleep apnea </h3><br>  <b>The main reason is overweight.</b> <br><br>  Due to excessive weight in the prone position, the angle of inclination of the head can change and lead to compression of the respiratory tract. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>A simple way to treat sleep apnea</b> <br><br>  If sleep apnea manifests itself when you are lying on your back, then try to avoid this position.  This will help sleep in a T-shirt with a pocket sewn to the back, which sews a tennis ball. <br><br>  This will make sleeping on your back uncomfortable and help you roll over without waking up. <br>  on the side or belly. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC_%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D1%2585_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3">Restless Leg Syndrome</a> </h2><br>  Sufferers from restless legs syndrome (RLS) feel the need to constantly move their legs, if it occurs mostly at night, then it is called the syndrome of periodic limb movement disorder (PDHC). <br><br>  The exact causes of RLS are unknown, but it is assumed that it is caused by a lack of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25BE%25D1%2584%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD">dopamine</a> in the brain.

Effectively taking vitamins with an iron content of 30-60 mg and 100 mg of vitamin C for better absorption of iron.  Take best on an empty stomach, every day or every other day. <br><br>  The level of ferritin in the blood in restless leg syndrome should be kept at 60-120 ng / ml. <br><br>  <b>In any case, before taking vitamins, you should take a blood test and consult a doctor.</b> <br><br><hr><h3>  If the above methods did not help improve sleep, consult your doctor, as you most likely will need intensive therapy with taking sleeping pills and sedatives. </h3><hr><br>  <b>Sleep well and be healthy!</b> <br><br><hr>  A source: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/298/4db/00e/2984db00ec29976fe5187bcc9de7e96a.jpg" align="left"><br>  <b>Jacob Teitelbaum</b> <br>  <b>Always tired.</b>  How to cope with chronic fatigue syndrome <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/323220/">Introductory article on chronic fatigue syndrome</a> <br><br>  Publisher: Mann, Ivanov and Ferber, 2017 </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/323494/">https://habr.com/ru/post/323494/</a></p>
