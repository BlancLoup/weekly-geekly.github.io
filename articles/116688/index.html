  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Brief description of potential home information systems (1971)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Paul Baran, one of the architects of the ARPANET network (a prototype of the modern Internet), published in 1971 his extremely fantastic forecast for that time on how such information systems can be used in the future.  After 40 years, the forecast surprises with its accuracy, except that the author has greatly exaggerated the craving of mankind for education, and the rest is as if talking about eBay, Amazon, Google, etc. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. Non-cash public transactions.  Record any financial transactions with the issuance of a check to the seller and the buyer, reliable recording and updating the balance in computer memory. <br><br>  2. Personal newspaper.  A set of pages with text and graphics, possibly including photos, the organization of which was predetermined by the user, taking into account his preferences. <br><br>  3. Computer school instructions.  At the lowest level, the computer distributes tasks for the day for each student and receives a report at the end of the day.  At a more sophisticated level, such a service will use a color display with real-time video display, voice input and output, and a program that adapts to each student's performance and character.

      4. Trade transactions (store catalogs).  Interactive programs, possibly with videos that describe or show products at the request of the buyer, tell him prices, location, time of delivery, etc. <br><br>  5. Person-to-person (paid work from home). Video and fax service that replaces the daily personal contacts for middle managers.  It can also be used for customer service by a pharmacist, doctor or his assistant. <br><br>  6. Films and theatrical productions from the video library.  Requires color and good sound. <br><br>  7. Computer tutor.  Using a catalog of educational programs, the computer will interactively train a student (usually an adult) in a given subject. <br><br>  8. Record messages.  Probably the same type as now, but may include video memory (the patient shows the doctor a rash, which he found). <br><br>  9. Assistance of the secretary.  Handwritten and dictated letters can be typed by the secretary remotely. <br><br>  10. Home letters and messages.  Letters and notes are sent straight to and from home as if by fax. <br><br>  11. Mass mailing and advertising by mail.  Higher print runs, larger pages and the use of color may be necessary to attract the attention of the consumer, otherwise see clause 10. <br><br>  12. Operator telephone service.  Storing the recorded messages or notes, who to call - perhaps computer logic will recognize emergency situations and redirect the call. <br><br>  13. List of prices for groceries, information and order.  Grocery prices are listed as an example of current, up-to-date information on perishable goods.  A color video display may be needed to check selected purchases before ordering. <br><br>  14. Access to corporate documents.  Information in the documents is encoded for security: regularly updated files are available with cross-references to fragments with more detailed information.  Synthesis can also be possible. <br><br>  15. Ticket prices and reservations.  How travel agencies work now, but with exhaustive coverage and faster.  Prices are lower; information on differences between airlines, including services, menus, etc. may be available. <br><br>  16. Past and future events.  Events, dates of events and their brief description;  small announcements of future theatrical productions, recordings of the past. <br><br>  17. School correspondence.  Taped or live school, university or vocational courses are available on request for inspection or study. <br><br>  18. Diary and schedule of meetings.  Pre-recorded special meetings or recurring events are stored in a programmable diary. <br><br>  19. Computer help at meetings.  The computer participates on an equal footing in meetings, answering questions, communicating facts, discovering connections and extrapolating trends. <br><br>  20. Newspapers.  Daily newspapers, possibly printed at night, arrive to the reader for breakfast.  Special issues come out after important events. <br><br>  21. Evening television courses for adults.  Non-interactive broadcast mode, live courses - a wider range of topics than now. <br><br>  22. Banking services.  Money orders, transfers, consultations. <br><br>  23. Legal information.  The Bar provides computerized legal advice, issuing precedents, decisions in similar cases, reporting on the jurisdiction of various courts. <br><br>  24. Information about sales.  Any sale at a user-specified distance from the house and the specified product will be displayed on the home display. <br><br>  25. Consultation service for consumers.  The equivalent of Consumer Reports magazine lists the best products, determines product ratings, etc. <br><br>  26. Meteorological service.  Weather forecasts for the whole country and individual territories or special forecasts (for farmers, fishermen), warnings about hurricanes and tornadoes, similar to the existing services. <br><br>  27. Schedule of buses, trains and airplanes.  Centralized referral service with a single phone number. <br><br>  28. Restaurants.  At the user's request, the type of restaurant (Japanese, for example) is determined, the ability to book a table, the menu and prices are displayed.  It may be possible to display images of dishes and table arrangement. <br><br>  29. Access to the library.  After an interactive ‚Äúbrowsing‚Äù on the ‚Äúlibrary computer‚Äù and a request for the cost of either a hard copy by fax or a low-quality video transmission, a book or magazine is sent directly to the house. <br><br>  30. List of all services available through the home terminal.  It includes prices or a monthly fee for each of them. <br><br>  <i>About the author: <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D1%258D%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD,_%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB">Paul Baran</a> (1926‚Äì2011), American engineer of Belarusian origin, one of the architects of the ARPANET network.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116688/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116688/</a></p>
