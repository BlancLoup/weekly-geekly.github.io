  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Google Search Quality prohibits link exchange and recommends SMO.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As it is known, the largest search engines, like <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> and <a href="http://www.yandex.ru/">Yandex</a> , are in a state of permanent struggle with an army of optimizers, whose task is to raise sites in search results for one or another key query by any means.  Often, as a result of such ‚Äúlittering‚Äù of search results, the relevance of the search suffers, therefore search sites traditionally consider optimizers as enemies, although they recognize the right of site owners to promote their projects.  The only question is what methods of promotion they have the right to apply. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Search sites behave very secretively.  They not only hide internal ranking algorithms, but even keep secret methods of dealing with optimizers.  That is, SEO-shnik sometimes do not know what exactly they are allowed to do and what is not allowed.  They get their own information and exchange information at conferences where Google representatives secretly penetrate. <br><br>  Search Quality is directly involved in the fight against black optimizers.  That is why the revelations of employee Stephanie Ulrike Durr (Stefanie Ulrike Durr) from the Search Quality office in Dublin caused such a strong reaction among SEO specialists. <br><br>  The notorious <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2006/12/building-link-based-popularity.html">post</a> was posted on the <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/">Official Google Webmaster Central Blog</a> on Friday evening.  It was written as a result of a meeting between the Google Search Quality team and independent SEO specialists at the SES conference in Paris.

      Stephanie explains by what parameters reference spam is determined.  Prohibited methods for obtaining incoming links are clearly <a href="http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py%3Fanswer%3D35769">described in the Quality Guidelines</a> , but before that, optimizers were able to still benefit from such dishonest methods as buying inbound links and exchanging links.  Now, says Stephanie, significant changes have been made to PageRank's algorithms, so the weight of links is now calculated in a new way, which should hit the link sellers a lot.  Moreover, an extra few people have been thrown at the solution of this problem, who will correct the work of the algorithms. <br><br>  According to Stephanie, from now on, optimizers cannot be guided by link exchange, because this practice will be severely punished.  Instead, Search Quality recommends using other ways to get inbound links.  For example, an effective method of acquiring links on social media sites has recently emerged, that is, writing interesting texts and placing links on sites like <a href="http://www.digg.com/">Digg</a> or participating in social question and answer services such as <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/">Answers</a> .  This optimization method is completely legal and, by analogy with SEO, is called <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/tag/SMO">SMO</a> . <br><br>  After the appearance of these recommendations among optimizers, a <a href="http://www.seroundtable.com/archives/006991.html">stormy discussion ensued</a> , in which Adam Lasnik from Google took part.  The main question that torments them: will Google punish only for a paid link exchange, or for free, too?  How does the system distinguish one from the second and how will it calculate the tripartite exchange schemes?  And in general, the link exchange appeared on the Web even earlier than Google, so it‚Äôs not for her to judge webmasters. <br><br>  The original post by Stephanie Duerr is referred to simply as ‚Äúlink exchange.‚Äù  As follows from the explanations of Lasnik, apparently, the system will punish any such exchange. <br><br>  In general, the staff of the Quality Guidelines give the optimizers traditional advice: in the optimization process, focus on users, not on the search engine. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4853/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4853/</a></p>
