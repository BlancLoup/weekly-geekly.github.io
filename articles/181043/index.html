The topic would seem hackneyed, but as it turned out, every writer stumbles upon the same rake as his predecessors. <br><br><h4>  As I come to this </h4><br>  Actually, the story was planned exclusively about the thesis of the it-orientation, and not about the graduate school, as such, but without some preface, the motivation of the decisions may not be clear.  Part of the thoughts can be attributed to dissertations of any kind, but there are also thoughts concerning technical areas only. <br><br>  For personal reasons, after graduating from the university, he stayed in the same city, right there in Russia for a couple of years (although the mood is ‚Äúporativalitelnoe‚Äù).  Initially, graduate school was not planned, but a couple of months before graduation, I realized that this time is enough for something more substantial than 3 years of work as a system administrator.  I decided to put efforts into the mainstream of science. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I talked with the future supervisor, he was only in favor.  Also approximately decided on the topic (there were some developments already).  Immediately make a reservation.  I wanted something that would really be of some value, and not just an ephemeral candidate of technical science.  I wanted the <i>practical</i> significance of their work.  Yes, and it-like orientation should contribute.  The plans were completely clear.  Admission, fulfillment of the formal requirements of the Higher Attestation Commission for the first year or two, calm writing of the dissertation, protection.

      Then he entered the graduate school and ... And there was a sharp meeting of a graduate student with the asphalt of reality of Russian science. <br><br><h4>  Directly thesis.  (The following applies to Russia) </h4><br>  It all started quite well.  Nauchruk said ‚Äúwork!‚Äù The first 3-4 weeks, and I already have a couple of conferences, an article in a peer-reviewed publication, new on the way.  Another conversation with the students on the topic of approval.  Actually, enthusiasm ends here.  By this time, the Nuru and spoke out against my topic.  Failed to convince.  Cause?  The reason I just ran out: big data is too specific, there is no global research. <br><br>  The situation is unpleasant.  But after talking with others (and even graduate students, and already candidates), he concluded: <br>  <u>1. It is necessary to come to the postgraduate study either with a ready-made piece (pulling at least something close to the chapter), or not to turn to a more or less positive statement of the topic.</u> <br>  Only after this, take up writing articles and conferences (unless, of course, this is not the case when it is just interesting to speak / write / make).  Otherwise, the efforts and material costs (all this is not at all a thousand rubles worth) will go to pieces.  Since the relationship to the topic of the thesis will not have.  It would seem, despite the fact that he recognized the person well, while still a student with him.  When the denser work begins, much more can be seen. <br><br>  <u>2. The main goal of postgraduate studies (naturally after the research itself) is to write a thesis.</u> <br>  This must be remembered and not to forget to periodically remind the academic director and the department, and, if necessary, to say absolutely no.  The situation is such that graduate students hang a lot of work, turning them into gratuitous labor.  There are friends on whom (even without registration at the department as an assistant) they hung 3-4‚Äì5‚Äì5 pairs 2-3‚Äì4 days once a week.  What translates into a load almost equal to the officially registered teacher. <br><br>  This also includes various work at the department.  R &amp; D, compilation of textbooks, teaching materials, educational complexes, and so on. <br><br>  And again, here are the various activities, personal affairs of the department staff and supervisor.  It's one thing to help several times.  Quite another, when the abuse begins on the part of the supervisor.  Nothing good comes when a graduate student chasing both left and right, at that event, and here on an open day, and even sits at night doing an informatics / English assignment for a blockhead son for tomorrow.  There are even stories on the postgraduate forums when he worked almost as the personal driver of his teacher, taking him from his drinking room and making other trips, but didn‚Äôt say no, afraid to spoil the relationship a little.  But even so, relations are unlikely to be so good as to just then thoroughly facilitate later protection. <br><br>  We must remember.  It is already much easier to finish filing a thesis with a file than to try to assemble it in pieces for a long time.  In the case of an exorbitant load, the collection option is likely to happen in pieces. <br><br>  <u>3. Work with one person.</u> <br>  What do I mean by this?  The supervisor is a graduate student one.  It may happen that other persons may begin to interfere in the work process (for example, experienced teachers of the department).  They may be followed by advice or insistent recommendations to apply in the thesis, do it.  Accordingly, before you do something on their advice, think, is it necessary?  Discuss this with the supervisor.  In my case, it was a person who very strongly recommended including UML in my work, moreover, so that it influenced the meaning.  Naturally, the proposal was almost immediately rejected, since the UML had no relation to the topic of the thesis, and if I had included it there, I would have taken an interest in the place of an outsider: ‚ÄúWhy is this here?‚Äù.  And it could also be phrases like ‚Äúneural networks‚Äù, mathematical-economic modeling. ‚ÄùThere is nothing wrong with them. It‚Äôs bad when they are tried to be applied completely out of place. <br>  It must be remembered that when defending, it would hardly be appropriate to say ‚ÄúWell, one of our teachers told me so‚Äù ... <br><br>  <u>4. Focus on world science, and not only on Russian.</u> <br>  The problem of Russian science lies in the fact that many of its representatives are stuck in the polar world "we and the stupid bourgeois imperialists abroad".  If nauchuk close to such sentiments, then it is bad.  But alas, there are few options.  One of them is to be guided by the world, but not to spread much about it.  Naturally, I consider the situation when the applicant himself wants to achieve something, to do something.  For the formal degree of a candidate bathing in a small lake, Russian science may be enough.  From item 4 it follows item 5 and 6. <br><br><h5>  Specificity associated with it </h5><br>  <u>5. English.</u>  <u>Must have.</u> <br>  Significant works, as a rule, are published in English.  Accordingly, to use them, the language is needed.  And all the more necessary if there are intentions to publish not only in the Russian Federation.  Language in general becomes mandatory for the it-industry, since it is one of the convertible industries (as opposed to the same lawyers).  If I hadn‚Äôt had a language before that, I would probably spend the first half of the year in graduate school to study English. <br><br>  A plus, of course, is knowledge of some other language.  I do not know these.  But the 6 days spent on translation and awareness of two articles from Japanese and German were worth it.  Their content prompted thoughts that later degenerated into a publication, from which, in turn, a certain amount of material went into the dissertation. <br><br>  <u>6. Imagine where it may then need / can be applied.</u> <br>  Well, if so.  In fact, this implies an intelligible work, with justifications and the answer to the question ‚ÄúWhy is all this necessary?‚Äù.  It may seem that if the work is written on it-thematic, then the point can be neglected, they say, and just as clearly.  Maybe clear.  But not for others.  The specificity and availability of the answer to the question "why ..." can help defend their point of view.  I neglected to defend my point of view for the reason that ‚Äúand just as clearly‚Äù and received as a result of claim 1 with the time thrown to the wind.  Partly due to the stiffness of people.  Many continue to think in categories that were relevant in it 20-30 years ago.  But nowhere (at least in the Russian education) this cannot be avoided. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Of course, it is difficult to go somewhat at odds with the prevailing opinion of many pundits, but otherwise what science will work out?  The situation at the moment is such that Russian science is ill with pride.  For this reason, we are threatening to create our own university rankings.  For this reason, we have so many works, ‚Äústudies‚Äù and models that no one will ever use in practice or for further research, which are transfused from empty to empty light without bringing something new. <br><br>  The problem is that beyond the forest, most do not see the trees.  Everyone wants globality, everyone wants students with ‚Äúglobal research‚Äù, but no one wants a specific product that spills over into technology, a specific product, because it is ‚Äúnot global‚Äù.  But if you allow yourself to be pulled into this swamp, then there is little chance of bringing something new.  Do I have to try?  I guess it's yes.  After all, if you do not try to change the situation, then it will not change (if you associate yourself with Russia and its science).  And even if you do not become attached to Russia and mark in other countries, then you should ask yourself the question ‚ÄúIs it not a shame to me to answer about my qualifying work when asked?‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/181043/">https://habr.com/ru/post/181043/</a></p>
