Wilk [Howard J. Wilk] - a chemist, a specialist in synthetic organics, has not worked in his field for a long time and lives in Philadelphia.  Like many other researchers working in the pharmaceutical field, he was the victim of reductions in R &amp; D in the drug industry in recent years, and is now engaged in part-time jobs not related to science.  With free time, Wilk tracks the progress of a company from New Jersey, <a href="http://brilliantlightpower.com/">Brilliant Light Power</a> (BLP). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This is one of those companies that are developing processes that can generally be referred to as new energy extraction technologies.  This movement, for the most part, is a resurrection of cold fusion - a short-lived phenomenon in the 1980s involving the production of nuclear fusion in a simple desktop electrolytic device, which scientists quickly dismounted. <br><br>  In 1991, the founder of BLP, Randell L. Mills [Randell L. Mills], announced at a press conference in Lancaster (Pa.) About the development of a theory according to which an electron in hydrogen can pass from its usual, basic energy state into previously unknown, more steady states with lower energy, with the release of huge amounts of energy.  Mills called this strange new type of compressed hydrogen, " <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/27787/">hydrino</a> ", and has since been working on developing a commercial device that collects this energy.

      Wilk studied Mills theory, read papers and patents, and did his own calculations for hydrino.  Wilk even attended a demonstration at the BLP site in Cranbury, New Jersey, where he discussed hydrino with Mills.  After this, Wilk still cannot decide whether Mills is an unreal genius, a delirious scholar, or something mean. <br><br>  The story began in 1989, when electrochemists Martin Fleischman and Stanley Pons made <a href="">an amazing statement</a> at a press conference at the University of Utah that they had tamed the nuclear fusion energy in an electrolytic cell. <br><br>  When the researchers applied electric current to the cell, in their opinion, deuterium atoms from heavy water, which penetrated the palladium cathode, entered into a fusion reaction and produced helium atoms.  The excess energy of the process turned into heat.  Fleischman and Pons argued that this process could not be the result of any known chemical reaction, and they added the term "cold synthesis" to it. <br><br>  After many months of investigating their mysterious observations, however, the scientific community <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/isubscribe/journals/cen/81/i34/html/8134sci3.html">agreed</a> that the effect was unstable, or absent altogether, and that errors were made in the experiment.  The study was rejected, and cold fusion became synonymous with garbage science. <br><br>  Cold fusion and hydrino production is the holy grail for extracting infinite, cheap and clean energy.  Scientists cold synthesis disappointed.  They wanted to believe in him, but their collective mind decided that this was a mistake.  Part of the problem was the lack of a generally accepted theory to explain the proposed phenomenon ‚Äî as physicists say, it is impossible to believe an experiment until it is confirmed by theory. <br><br>  Mills has his own theory, but many scientists do not believe it and consider hydrino unlikely.  The community rejected cold fusion and ignored Mills and his work.  Mills did the same, trying not to fall into the shadow of cold fusion. <br><br>  Meanwhile, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãcold fusion changed its name to low-energy nuclear reactions (NEJAR) [low-energy nuclear reactions, LENR], and it exists further.  Some scientists continue to attempt to explain the Fleischmann-Pons effect.  Others have rejected nuclear fusion, but are exploring other possible processes that can explain excess heat.  Like Mills, they were attracted by the potential of commercial applications.  They are mainly interested in the extraction of energy for industrial needs, households and transport. <br><br>  A small number of companies created in an attempt to bring new energy technologies to the market, business models are similar to models of any technological startup: identify a new technology, try to patent an idea, generate investor interest, get funding, build prototypes, hold a demonstration, announce the dates of workers devices for sale.  But in the new energy world, deadlines are the norm.  No one has yet made the last step with a demonstration of the working device. <br><br><h2>  New theory </h2><br>  Mills grew up on a farm in Pennsylvania, received a degree in chemistry from Franklin and Marshall College, a medical degree from Harvard University, and studied electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  As a student, he began to develop a theory, which he called the " <a href="http://brilliantlightpower.com/atomic-theory">Big United Theory of Classical Physics</a> ", which, he said, is based on classical physics and offers a new model of atoms and molecules that depart from the fundamentals of quantum physics. <br><br>  It is believed that the only electron of hydrogen snoops around its nucleus, being on the most acceptable orbit of the ground state.  It is simply impossible to move the hydrogen electron closer to the nucleus.  But Mills claims it is possible. <br><br>  Eric Baard, a journalist who <a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/news/quantum-leap-6420156">wrote about Mills</a> , once noted how shockingly the thought about the controversial hydrogen model looks like: ‚Äútelling physicists that they were wrong, it's like telling American mothers that they misunderstood apple pie‚Äù. <br><br>  One of the physicists is Andrea Rathke, a former researcher at the European Space Agency, about whom the agency‚Äôs website said that he ‚Äúexposed a large number of nuts‚Äù.  In 2005, Ratke analyzed the theory of Mills and published a paper in which he pointed out that this theory is erroneous and incompatible with everything that physicists know ( <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/7/1/127">New J. Phys. 2005, DOI: 10.1088 / 1367-2630 / 7/1/127</a> ). <br><br>  He is currently working as a researcher at Airbus Defense &amp; Space, and says he has not monitored Mills since 2007, since the experiments did not observe unambiguous signs of excess energy.  ‚ÄúI doubt that any later experiments have been scientifically selected,‚Äù said Ratke. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI think it is generally recognized that Dr. Mills‚Äôs theory, which he put forward as the basis of his statements, is contradictory and incapable of making predictions,‚Äù continues Ratke.  ‚ÄúOne might ask, 'Could we have so successfully stumbled upon an energy source that just works, following the wrong theoretical approach?'  ". <br><br>  In the 1990s, several researchers, including a team from the Lewis Research Center, <a href="http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/sensors/PhySen/docs/TM-107167.pdf">independently reported</a> replicating the Mills approach and obtaining excess heat.  The NASA team in the report wrote that "the results are far from convincing," and did not say anything about hydrino. <br><br>  Researchers have suggested possible electrochemical processes for explaining heat, including the irregularity of the electrochemical cell, unknown exothermic chemical reactions, recombination of separated hydrogen atoms and oxygen in water.  The same arguments were also quoted by the critics of the Fleishman-Pons experiments.  But a team from NASA clarified that researchers should not discard this phenomenon, just in case Mills came across something. <br><br>  Mills speaks very quickly, and is able to talk about technical details forever.  In addition to predicting hydrino, Mills argues that his theory can ideally predict the location of any electron in a molecule, using special software for modeling molecules, and even in such complex molecules as DNA.  Using standard quantum theory, scientists find it difficult to predict the exact behavior of something more complex than a hydrogen atom.  Mills also claims that his theory explains the phenomenon of the Universe expansion with acceleration, which cosmologists have not fully understood. <br><br>  In addition, Mills says that hydrinos appear when hydrogen is burned in stars such as our Sun, and that they can be found in the spectrum of starlight.  Hydrogen is considered the most common element in the universe, but Mills argues that hydrino is the dark matter that cannot be found in the universe.  Astrophysicists are surprised to see such assumptions: ‚ÄúI have never heard of hydrino,‚Äù says <a href="http://astro.uchicago.edu/~rocky">Edward W.</a> [ <a href="http://astro.uchicago.edu/~rocky">Edward W. (Rocky) Kolb</a> ] from the University of Chicago, an expert on the <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/outlook/dark-universe/index.html">dark universe</a> . <br><br>  Mills reported successful isolation and description of hydrino using standard spectroscopic methods such as infrared, Raman, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.  In addition, according to him, hydrino can react, leading to the emergence of new types of materials with "amazing properties."  This includes guides who, according to Mills, will revolutionize the world of electronic devices and batteries. <br><br>  And although his statements contradict public opinion, Mills‚Äôs ideas do not seem so exotic compared to other unusual components of the Universe.  For example, muonium is a well-known short-lived exotic entity, consisting of an anti-muon (a positively charged particle resembling an electron) and an electron.  Chemically, muonium behaves as an isotope of hydrogen, but it is nine times easier. <br><br><h2>  SunCell, hydrin fuel cell </h2><br>  Regardless of where the hydrino is located in the plausibility scale, Mills told him ten years ago that BLP had already advanced beyond the scientific evidence, and she was only interested in the commercial side of the issue.  Over the years, BLP has raised over $ 110 million in investments. <br><br>  The BLP approach to creating hydrino manifested itself in different ways.  In the early prototypes, Mills and the team used tungsten or nickel electrodes with an electrolytic solution of lithium or potassium.  The supplied current split water into hydrogen and oxygen, and under the right conditions, lithium or potassium played the role of a catalyst for absorbing the energy and collapse of the electron orbit of hydrogen.  The energy arising from the transition from the ground atomic state to a state with a lower energy was released in the form of a bright high-temperature plasma.  The heat associated with it was then used to create steam and power the generator. <br><br>  The BLP is currently testing a <a href="http://brilliantlightpower.com/suncell">SunCell</a> device in which hydrogen (from water) and oxide catalyst are fed to a spherical carbon reactor with two streams of molten silver.  The electric current supplied to silver triggers a plasma reaction with the formation of a hydrino.  The reactor energy is captured by carbon, which acts as a ‚Äúblack body radiator‚Äù.  When it is heated to thousands of degrees, it emits energy in the form of visible light captured by photovoltaic cells that convert light into electricity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/06a/25a/cec/06a25acec5368a2e040b9fb92beaca74.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Regarding commercial developments, Mills sometimes looks like a paranoid and sometimes like a practical businessman.  He registered the trademark "Hydrino".  And since his patents claim hydrino invention, BLP claims intellectual property on hydrino research.  In this regard, the BLP prohibits other experimenters from even conducting basic hydrino studies, which can confirm or deny their existence, without first signing the agreement on intellectual property.  ‚ÄúWe invite researchers, we want others to do this,‚Äù says Mills.  ‚ÄúBut we need to protect our technology.‚Äù <br><br>  Instead, Mills appointed authorized validators claiming that they can confirm the validity of BLP inventions.  One of them is an electrical engineer from the University of Bucknell, Professor Peter M. Jenson [ <a href="http://www.bucknell.edu/engineering-college-of/academic-departments/electrical-and-computer-engineering/faculty-and-staff/peter-mark-jansson.html">Peter M. Jansson</a> ], who is paid for evaluating BLP technology through his consulting company Integrated Systems.  Jenson argues that the compensation of his time "does not in any way affect my findings as an independent researcher of scientific discoveries."  He adds that he "refuted most of the discoveries" that he studied. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe scientists at BLP are doing real science, and so far I have not found any errors in their methods and approaches,‚Äù says Jenson.  ‚ÄúOver the years, I have seen many devices in BLP that are clearly capable of producing excess energy in meaningful quantities.  I think that the scientific community will need some time to accept and digest the possibility of the existence of low-energy states of hydrogen.  In my opinion, the work of Dr. Mills is indisputable. ‚Äù  Jenson adds that the BLP faces difficulties in the commercial application of technology, but the obstacles are business, not scientific. <br><br>  In the meantime, BLP has held several demonstrations of its new prototypes for investors since 2014, and published videos on its website.  But these events do not provide clear evidence that SunCell really works. <br><br>  In July, after one of the demonstrations, the company announced that the estimated cost of energy from SunCell is so small ‚Äî from 1% to 10% of any other known form of energy ‚Äî that the company ‚Äúis going to provide autonomous individual power sources for almost all fixed and mobile applications that are not tied to the grid or fuel sources of energy ".  In other words, the company plans to build and lease SunCells or other devices to consumers, charging a daily fee, and allowing them to get rid of power grids and stop buying gasoline or solarium, while spending several times less money. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis is the end of an era of fire, an internal combustion engine and centralized power supply systems,‚Äù says Mills.  - Our technology will make all other types of energy technologies obsolete.  Climate change issues will be solved. ‚Äù  He adds that, apparently, the BLP may start production, for the start of stations with a capacity of MW, by the end of 2017. <br><br><h2>  What is in the name? </h2><br>  Despite the uncertainty surrounding Mills and BLP, their story is only part of a common saga about new energy.  When, after the initial statement of Fleischmann-Pons, the dust settled, two researchers began to study what was right and what was not.  They were joined by dozens of co-authors and independent researchers. <br><br>  Many of these scientists and engineers who often worked on their own funds were interested not so much in commercial opportunities as in science: electrochemistry, metallurgy, calorimetry, mass spectrometry, and nuclear diagnostics.  They continued to set up experiments that produced excess heat, defined as the amount of energy produced by the system, relative to the energy required for its operation.  In some cases, nuclear anomalies have been reported, such as the appearance of neutrinos, Œ±-particles (helium nuclei), isotopes of atoms and transmutations of some elements into others. <br><br>  But in the end, most researchers are looking for an explanation of what is happening, and they would be happy even if a modest amount of heat would be useful. <br><br>  ‚ÄúNEJR are in the experimental phase and are not yet theoretically understood,‚Äù says <a href="https://www.ece.seas.gwu.edu/david-nagel">David J. Nagel</a> , a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University.  George Washington, and a former research manager at the Morphlot Research Laboratory.  ‚ÄúSome results are simply unexplainable.  Call it cold fusion, low-energy nuclear reactions, or something else ‚Äî enough names ‚Äî we still don‚Äôt know anything about it.  But there is no doubt that nuclear reactions can be launched with the help of chemical energy. ‚Äù <br><br>  Nagel prefers to call the NEJAR phenomenon "lattice nuclear reactions", since the phenomenon occurs in the crystal lattices of the electrode.  The initial branch of this area focuses on the introduction of deuterium into the palladium electrode by applying a high energy supply, explains Nagel.  Researchers reported that such electrochemical systems can produce up to 25 times more energy than they consume. <br><br>  The other main branch of the region uses combinations of nickel and hydrogen, which gives up to 400 times more energy than it consumes.  Nagel likes to compare these NEJAR technologies with an <a href="https://www.iter.org/">experimental international thermonuclear reactor</a> based on well-known physics - the fusion of deuterium and tritium - which is being built in the south of France.  The cost of this 20-year project is $ 20 billion, and its goal is to produce energy that exceeds the consumption by 10 times. <br><br>  Nagel says that the NEJAR region is growing everywhere, and the main obstacles are lack of funding and unstable results.  For example, some researchers report that to trigger a reaction, it is necessary to reach a certain threshold value.  It may require a minimum amount of deuterium or hydrogen to run, or the electrodes must be prepared, giving them a crystallographic orientation and surface morphology.  The last requirement is usual for heterogeneous catalysts used in the purification of gasoline and petrochemical plants. <br><br>  Nagel admits that the commercial side of NEJAR also has problems.  The developed prototypes, in his words, are ‚Äúrather rough‚Äù, and a company has not yet emerged that has demonstrated a working prototype or has earned money on it. <br><br><h2>  E-Cat from Rossi </h2><br>  One striking attempt to put NEYAR on commercial rails was made by <a href="http://andrea-rossi.com/">engineer</a> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/243787/">Andrea Rossi</a> from <a href="http://ecat.com/">Leonardo Corp</a> , based in Miami.  In 2011, Rossi and his colleagues announced at a press conference in Italy the construction of the ‚ÄúEnergy Catalyzer‚Äù desktop reactor, or E-Cat, which produces excess energy in a process where nickel serves as a catalyst.  To substantiate the invention, Rossi demonstrated E-Cat to potential investors and the media, and appointed <a href="">independent verifications</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e2e/eaa/010/e2eeaa01076c5d50ccb3c7e00a1ba5df.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Rossi claims that a self-sustaining process occurs in his E-Cat, in which the incoming electrical current triggers the synthesis of hydrogen and lithium in the presence of a powder mixture of nickel, lithium and lithium aluminum hydride, which results in a beryllium isotope.  Short-lived beryllium decays into two Œ±-particles, and excess energy is released as heat.  A part of nickel turns into copper.  Rossi talks about the absence of both waste and radiation outside the apparatus. <br><br>  The announcement of Rossi caused the same unpleasant feeling in scientists as cold fusion.  Rossi causes many people to mistrust because of its controversial past.  In Italy, he was accused of fraud because of his previous business scams.  Rossi says these accusations are a thing of the past and don‚Äôt want to discuss them.  He also once had a contract for the creation of heat installations for the US Armed Forces, but the devices supplied to them did not work according to specifications. <br><br>  In 2012, Rossi announced the creation of a 1 MW system suitable for heating large buildings.  He also assumed that by 2013 he would already have a factory producing annually a million units with a capacity of 10 kW and the size of a laptop, intended for home use.  But neither the factory nor these devices happened. <br><br>  In 2014, Rossi sold the technology under a license to Industrial Heat, an open investment firm <a href="http://cherokeefund.com/">Cherokee</a> , which buys real estate and cleans up the old industrial zones for new development.  In 2015, Cherokee CEO Tom Darden, a lawyer and environmental specialist by education, called Industrial Heat "the source of funding for inventors of NEJAR." <br><br>  Darden says that Cherokee launched Industrial Heat because investment companies believe that NEYAR technology is worthy of research.  ‚ÄúWe were ready to make mistakes, we were ready to invest time and resources to find out if this area could be useful in our mission to prevent pollution [of the environment],‚Äù he says. <br><br>  Meanwhile, Industrial Heat and Leonardo had a fight, and now they are suing each other about violations of the agreement.  Rossi would get $ 100 million if the annual test of its 1 MW system were successful.  Rossi says the test is finished, but Industrial Heat doesn't think so, and they fear that the device is not working. <br><br>  Nagel says E-Cat has brought enthusiasm and hope to the NEUAR region.  In 2012, he argued that, in his opinion, Rossi was not a fraud, "but I do not like some of his approaches to testing."  Nagel believed that Rossi had to act more carefully and transparently.  But at that time, Nagel himself believed that devices based on the NEJAR principle would be on sale by 2013. <br><br>  Rossi continues to research and announced the development of other prototypes.  But he talks little about his work.  He says that 1 MW devices are already in production, and he received the "necessary certificates" for their sale.  Home devices, he said, are still awaiting certification. <br><br>  Nagel says that after the recession of the joyful mood associated with the announcements of Russia, the status quo returned to NEJAR.  The availability of commercial NEJAR generators has shifted by several years.  And even if the device withstands the problems of reproducibility and will be useful, its developers will have a fierce battle with the regulators and its acceptance by users. <br><br>  But he remains optimistic.  "NEYAR can become commercially available even before their full understanding, as was the case with X-rays," he says.  He has already equipped a laboratory at the University.  George Washington for new experiments with nickel and hydrogen. <br><br><h2>  Scientific Heritage </h2><br>  Many researchers who continue to work on the NEJR are already retired scientists.  This is not easy for them, because for years their work has been returned to non-reviewed from mainstream journals, and their proposals for reports at scientific conferences have not been accepted.  They are increasingly worried about the status of this area of ‚Äã‚Äãresearch as their time runs out.          ,     ,      . <br><br> ¬´  ,        1989      ,        ¬ª,     [Melvin H.
