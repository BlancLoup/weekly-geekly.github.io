      <b>news</b> <br><br>  - <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/blog/ue4-is-free">Unreal Engine 4 has become free for everyone</a> .  Previously, it was distributed by subscription: all users who paid the money will receive compensation.  Tim Swinney, founder of Epic Games, considers this a good business step, because the main user agreement remains in force.  If a game created with the Unreal Engine 4 generates income of more than $ 3,000 per quarter, the developer must pay 5% of total revenue. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/5orTzUuZPOg&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgculan2lBwYLr7fat_C6cZp8KJCw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  - Autodesk introduced <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/campaigns/stingray">the Stringray game engine</a> , which will support direct integration with 3D content creation tools.

For developers, this will be the first console release. <br><br>  <b>Not without scandals: a new wave of Gamer Gate</b> <br><br>  Mark Kern, one of the main developers of World of Warcraft, Firefall, Diablo II, Starcraft and founder of Mek Entertainment, started a real Twitter war against corruption and deceit in the gaming press. <br><br>  Mark Kern blamed the major gaming portals of Kotaku, Polygon, and vg247.com for inciting conflict after the episode of the TV series ‚ÄúLaw and Order‚Äù dedicated to video games.  <a href="https://www.change.org/p/kotaku-lead-the-way-in-healing-the-rift-in-video-games%3Fjust_created%3Dtrue">The developer created a petition</a> in which he asked for publications to stop writing about scandals and start a series of publications about gaming ethics, women in the industry and the positive aspects of video games. <br><br>  In response, Patrick Garrath from the portal vg247.com wrote an article in which he ridiculed Kern's requirements and advised the developers not to sign the petition.  At the same time, his tone was ... slightly threatening. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/002/58a/bc4/00258abc4c05480a8e792688d35419ad.png"><br><br>  Nathan Grayson, a Kotaku portal journalist who had previously been implicated in the scandal involving Zoe Quinn, joined the discussion.  Actually, it was this scandal that initiated the GamerGate phenomenon. <br><br>  Polygon's Ben Kucera posted a tweet in which he wrote that everyone who supported GamerGate and the petition should stop reading its materials. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/89b/a2d/6c8/89ba2d6c8a954e3cae2a593e3987f2a3.png"><br><br>  And then - even more fun: Ben Kucera was one of the participants of GameJournoPros - a group of journalists from large publications who put the developers on the general blacklist, put pressure on their colleagues and manipulated public opinion.  Their postal correspondence was published in September, and caused a lot of negativity. <br><br>  All these events resulted in a new wave of GamerGate at GDC 2015. Journalists, players and developers have created thousands of tweets (already about 70,000) with the text ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna be a free and unbiased gaming press.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d59/881/adc/d59881adc35b4e69ae49760dd2883955.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/963/052/219/96305221916042cab04a115749bd6b91.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/626/98f/fd7/62698ffd79724134bdbac1f48a471383.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/745/c8d/28b/745c8d28b59744cf8a3dccde9a35cad5.png"><br><br>  Will the conflict be further developed - we find out tonight. <br><br>  Several gaming trailers and a whole ton of interesting photos from GDC <a href="http://alwaysingame.tumblr.com/post/112591463188/gdc-2015-1">can be found on this blog.</a> <br><br>  Also, the GameStop portal <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/videos/gamespot-presents-the-mix-at-gdc-2015/2300-6423622/">organized a live stream with developers</a> , where you can watch interesting gaming news and listen to the stories of representatives of gaming companies. <br><br>  Despite the huge number of reports and new information, on the first day of the conference we did not receive so loud announcements or releases.  However, the situation may change today, as we are waiting for presentations from NVIDIA, Unity, Valve and Amazon. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/252053/">https://habr.com/ru/post/252053/</a></p>
