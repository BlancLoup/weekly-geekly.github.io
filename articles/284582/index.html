  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where is the casino?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <a href="http://gdecasino.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/3a/24/3a24984667d29601117cf33cf52015ce.png" alt="image"></a> <br>  In January, saw the light of the project <a href="http://gdecasino.ru/">‚ÄúWhere is the casino?‚Äù</a> , Representing on the maps of 40 cities more than 200 points, which in the opinion of the public are gaming establishments.  Nowadays, there is less and less trust in the authorities, and the Internet community has repeatedly proved itself as a real tool for solving the problems of society. <br>  The objective of the project is to show that despite all the attempts of legislators to deal with gambling activities, the law ‚ÄúOn the gambling business‚Äù still has many holes and loopholes that allow businesses to continue their existence.  I think there is no need to describe in detail the principle of the site‚Äôs work, so we‚Äôll dwell on the legal side of the issue and find out how it happened. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  How did it happen? </h5><br>  Everyone knows that many laws of our country are imperfect.  For example, the law "On the gambling business in the Russian Federation."  Due to numerous loopholes in the law, slot machines, lottery clubs and even full-fledged casinos with blackjack and queens have proliferated throughout the country.  Since July 1, 2009, gambling outside the special zones is prohibited in Russia, including on the Internet, but this ban has not affected the lottery business.  After that, the owners of slot machines began to convert them into lottery. <br>  The case slightly moved from the dead center after the adoption of the <a href="http://www.rg.ru/2010/07/30/loterea-dok.html">Federal Law of the Russian Federation dated July 27, 2010 N 214- ‚ÄúOn Amendments to the Federal Law‚Äú On Lotteries</a> ‚Äù.  Following this law, the conduct of incentive lotteries using mechanical, electrical, electronic or other technical devices is prohibited.  But progress does not stand still, and the business moved to a new round of evolution - electronic goods stores. <br><br><h5>  How does it work now? </h5><br>  The principle of action of modern clubs is simple.  Now the visitor does not insert bills into the bill acceptor of the slot machine, but deposits his money into the cashier.  The club administrator, in turn, changes his money for the so-called "electronic tickets", with which a visitor can do anything.  For example, sit down at one of the computers located here and play a virtual lottery.  Most often access to such lotteries is carried out through the Internet, and the servers are located somewhere in the Bahamas and do not fall under Russian justice.  In case of a win, the administrator can redeem "electronic tickets" back - this is how the payout procedure is paid. <br><br><h5>  What did the project achieve in a month and a half? </h5><br>  The main achievement is a big resonance in the local and federal press.  Many probably read articles in KP and Rossiyskaya Gazeta, or even saw stories on TV.  Checks "lottery clubs", at least in Saratov, have become frequent.  But, unfortunately, there has not been a single complete closure so far - after a prosecutor‚Äôs check and removal of equipment in a few days, everything starts on a new one. <br>  In Russia, there is still no law that will allow to deal with the gambling business once and for all.

In addition, you can contact the project team through info@gdecasino.ru, the project needs regional moderators. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/284582/">https://habr.com/ru/post/284582/</a></p>
