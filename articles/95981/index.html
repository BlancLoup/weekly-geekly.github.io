On the faces of parents, sister, common-law wife, holding in his arms his one and a half year old son, is also not a hint of premonition of what will happen in this train (No. 2A, Moscow - Vladivostok) in 4 days. <br><br>  The road was coming far away - from Omsk to Khabarovsk (5 thousand km), from there by bus to the place of service - to the city of Bikin, to the motorized infantry unit.

      He didn’t rush into the army, but didn’t hide from her.  He was ready better than many of his peers to deal with her: he had boxing and Greco-Roman wrestling, he was also technically savvy — he studied in absentia in a chemical-mechanical technical school, worked at “Tekhuglerode” (one of the few successful industrial enterprises in Omsk), managed to play in the amateur theater.  He made plans - quite earthly.  “Here,” he said to me, “mother, I will return from the army,” says Tatyana Suslova, “I will set up a cottage: we will all live together happily ever after.”  With Oksana, they scheduled a wedding on June 26th.  And then the agenda came. <br><br>  Their relationship can be judged by the number of calls and text messages that they exchanged during these 4 days.  The first time Oksana called on May 19, two hours after the train left, “Not that she was worried about him, it was just like that that we had with him: we didn’t part with us for a long time and called back all the time: we asked how were things.” <br><br>  On 19, 20, 21st, Roman was in a cheerful mood: “Everything is in order - he met the guys.”  In the car - 30 draftees. <br><br>  On the 22nd in the morning at 10 o'clock 11 minutes, she dialed his number and heard a deaf voice: "They will kill me here or they will kill me." <br><br>  - Yes, that's exactly what he said, literally, - insists Oksana.  - I asked: "Who will kill you?" He replied: "Lieutenant, ensign ..." It was bad to hear - the battery was sitting down, and they did not let it charge it. <br><br>  The connection has been lost.  For 15 minutes she tried to call again.  Unsuccessfully.  Then he himself called his friend's mobile (his last name is unknown, his name is Joseph). <br><br>  “Roma whispered that food, water, cigarettes had been taken away from him, for some reason they were separated from everyone and almost under escort they were taken to the toilet,” says Oksana. <br><br>  She never spoke to him again.  On the next call, Joseph answered: “I do not understand what is happening.  We were all intimidated ... ”Then the connection was lost with him. <br><br>  On the morning of May 23, Tatyana Suslova was called by the commander of the unit (military unit 46102) of the Bikinsky garrison: “Your son killed himself — hanged himself in a public toilet at the railway station.” <br><br>  Autopsy and concealment <br><br>  Omichka Alma Bukharbaeva received a similar message from the same garrison 7 years ago.  About the death of her son Marat "New" told in the publication "Do not open!" (July 24, 2006).  With such an order, the command of military unit 2049 sent the mother a zinc coffin.  Alma order violated.  The autopsy revealed the following: a broken nose bridge, gray temple, on his hands - traces of handcuffs.  There was no strangulation furrow around the neck (loop trace), although in the telegram signed by the unit commander, as well as in the medical certificate issued by the forensic laboratory of the Far Eastern Military Institution, it was stated that the soldier hung himself.  There were no internal organs in the body.  All this was witnessed by the medical assistant of the midwife center, as well as the imam and 7 elders of the village, where the deceased was brought to bury. <br><br>  The body was sewn with one straight seam - from chin to groin.  The military prosecutor's office in Omsk did not give a sanction for re-examination.  According to the description of the seam, according to Alma and eyewitnesses, expert Leon Reich (head of the complex examination of the Omsk Regional Forensic Expertise) expressed doubt that it was an expert autopsy: if the organs are removed for analysis, then the incision line goes to the chest, then splits.  And then, in a person who committed suicide by hanging, as a rule, internal organs are not examined: the cause of death cannot be found in them. <br><br>  Two weeks after the funeral, the commander of the military unit sent a telegram: “An error has occurred, I apologize, your son, Burtubaev Marat, died tragically during military service.”  And the point.  No explanation from Colonel Bondarev followed. <br><br>  Marat was the fifth Omsk, who died in Bikin under mysterious circumstances.  On the following, Aleksey Aparine, “Novaya” told in the article “The Sixth” (April 12, 2007).  Alexey was found hanging on a belt with a huge hematoma on his head from a strong blow with a heavy object.  In the investigative documents - darkness inconsistencies, but to prove that the son is not a suicide, the parents could not. <br><br>  Stitched with the same thread <br><br>  According to the parent committee “Memory”, Roman Suslov is the seventh.  The original version of his death was also erroneous.  On the same day, the lieutenant Glushakov, who accompanied the recruits, called the mother of the recruit.  He said that Roman did not hang himself at the station (as the unit commander had previously stated), but in the toilet of the car. <br><br>  - I asked: what happened there?  - says Tatyana Anatolyevna.  - He answered: I do not know.  Roman behaved calmly and generally made a good impression on him.  No one there oppressed him and did not take away anything from him.  Everything was in order, and suddenly ... I asked the lieutenant: Does conscience bother you?  He answered: no, he does not torture, there were 30 of them, you will not follow all of them. <br><br>  I got through to Glushakov.  The lieutenant did not answer the questions: “I have already given explanations to the competent authorities.  Do you trust them? ” <br><br>  Investigation of the death of Roman Suslova is conducted by the military investigation department of the UPC of the RF in the Far Eastern District.  The case was initiated under the article "bringing to suicide."  According to preliminary data, the cause of death was "mechanical asphyxia."  News portals cite the investigator for particularly important cases of Vladimir Lymar: “There were no injuries on the body of the deceased recruit.” <br><br>  The coffin of Roman Suslov arrived in Omsk on Saturday, May 29.  His parents took him to the city of Kalachinsk, having agreed in advance with a good friend - a forensic scientist.  He refused to do the medical examination.  Perhaps he was embarrassed by the absence of the strangulation furrow in the “hanged man” on his neck, the presence of many bruises and hematomas on his face, back, hands, about which nothing was said in the Khabarovsk examination report.  Or maybe it seemed strange long seam - from the chin to the groin (photo - at the disposal of the publisher).  Same exactly as the son of Alma Bukharbaeva.  And also: on Roman’s hand, there were marks of injections (one on the finger, the other in the area of ​​the elbow joint), which, his relatives say, he didn’t have when he got on the train.  They don’t take blood from the dead - it is rolled up from them.  They take it from the living — for example, before the operation, to make sure that there is no inflammatory process in the blood, or, say, an injection is given during anesthesia, when an anesthetic is injected into the vein ... <br><br>  Border state <br><br>  During the trial in the Bikinsky garrison court, Khabarovsk expert Tereshin answered a question from Alma Bukharbayeva: “Why does my son have no internal organs?” Answered: “Don't you know that a kidney on the black market costs 50 thousand dollars?”.  In addition to the judges and the prosecutor, 6 people heard these words (five soldiers and a contract ensign).  As we reported in the article “Do not open!”, During Marat’s service in Khabarovsk, according to statements filed with the prosecutor’s office, 112 kidneys were excised without the permission of patients and their relatives, and the adrenal glands and spleens were also removed.  Prosecutors suspected that this was the cause of death of 56 donors.  43 recipients also died.  But local officials managed to pay off the scandal (!). <br><br>  The peculiarity of the Bikin garrison is that it is located close to the border with China, where the internal organs of a person are in “freer circulation” than in other countries.  An international scandal even arose around this topic in 2006: As reported by France Press, the representative of the US State Department Adam Ereli demanded that the Chinese side investigate cases of illegal organ sales.  Here is a fragment of the interview of the radio station France International with the representative of the World Health Organization, Mr. Noel: <br><br>  “Correspondent: According to the newspaper Le Figaro, WHO declared that foreigners could go to China to buy organs, especially those sentenced to death.  Can you confirm it? <br><br>  Noel: Everyone knows about it.  Everyone can see this on the websites of agents (organ sales) on the Internet.  These websites really see organ transplants in China as a landmark. ” <br><br>  We, for our part, do not assert anything - we simply state the facts that should be investigated by the competent authorities, as Lieutenant Glushakov put it.  For their information, Suslov is not the first recruit who “committed suicide” on the way to the Khabarovsk Territory.  On June 29 last year, a 21-year-old Kurganian Alexander Mazhuga (by the way, Roman Suslov was discovered in a belt loop several kilometers from Birobidzhan) was found hanged in the toilet of the train Chelyabinsk - Birobidzhan.  Alexander's relatives, who spoke to the Russian authorities on YouTube, are sure that the guy was killed. <br><br>  On December 15, 2009, a recruit from Tuva was found in a loop in China.  An assistant to the public relations of the military prosecutor of the Far Eastern District, Andrei Metchenko, said in local media that several days before the state of emergency the military prosecutor's office of the Bikinsky garrison opened a criminal case against the conscript under the article “unauthorized abandonment of the unit”. <br><br>  Information on other cases of the death of Russian soldiers in this military unit can be independently found by the competent authorities on the Internet. <br><br>  Tatyana Suslova’s statement was made by the Omsk military prosecutor’s office.  I think the version that Roman committed suicide should raise great doubts with the supervisory authority. <br><br>  PS On June 4, Roman's parents were informed that his case was taken under the personal control of the deputy.  Russian Defense Minister Nikolai Pankov <br><br>  From the Editor <br><br>  On June 3, the Omsk regional military registration and enlistment office picketed the parents of the dead soldiers, called up at different times, but in one place - the city of Bikin, Khabarovsk Territory.  According to the Pamyat parent union, seven Omsk were killed in this border area with China.  You can talk about a strange coincidence (seven cases in one garrison) and the mysterious circumstances of the death of young people.  But for their parents, who took to the streets, these coincidences and these circumstances are of secondary importance.  The main questions for them are: why did this happen, who should answer and what should be done to prevent the tragedy from happening again? <br><br>  Seven dead - inconspicuous losses for the Russian army.  Seven families - an insignificant figure for the country.  All this is so, if we abandon the human dimension of each “private” tragedy.  So it is our life that “inanimate objects” is becoming more and more, and fewer people.  Most, perhaps, our big deficit.  That is why we believe that the case of the Bikinsky garrison should be investigated at the highest level with the participation of the Chief Military Prosecutor's Office, with the involvement of the Committee of Soldiers' Mothers and the Commissioner for Human Rights in Russia - as a matter concerning not only the army, but also society as a whole. <br><br>  George Borodyansky <br>  our sob.  correspondent, Omsk <br><br>  Information from the specialist: <br><br>  I'll tell you about the scheme of the criminal business in medicine.  It is as follows: some southerner comes, conditionally, to some big boss who is involved in transplantation.  With a case full of dollars.  His nephew is in the clinic, and he cannot get a kidney transplant.  Southerner puts the case on the table and asks for help.  The chief may try to refuse, but if this person is gangster, it is difficult to argue ... The chief takes a pack of dollars out of the case, say, ten thousand.  He calls the person who is responsible for the collection of organs, gives him money and says: "So that the kidney is in two or three days."  Order is an order.  Comrade goes to his office.  Calls a young doctor who just came after school.  His salary is small.  And then he is given two thousand dollars: "That the kidney was!" This friend with his friend goes to the hospital, where their classmate works.  He asks: “How many dying patients are on the apparatus?” - “Four”.  - "With the first group there?" - "Yes."  - "Here you have a thousand dollars, provide a donor."  - "Everything.  Will be done.  Come at night. ” <br><br>  PS here I sit and think in what state we live. <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95981/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95981/</a></p>
