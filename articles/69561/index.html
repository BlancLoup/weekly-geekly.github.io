  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The police should hack more</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the United Kingdom has signed up for an EU strategy aimed at countering cyber crime, which pushes European police officers to remotely monitor personal data. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This plan caused a wave of concern that the government is increasing the powers of the police to hack citizens' computers without a court order. <br>  UK police have already conducted a ‚Äúsmall number‚Äù of such operations under this law. <br><br>  However, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the United Kingdom said that the agreement with the European Union will not affect the police. <br><br>  The plan drawn up by the EU Council provides a broad description of how to improve the fight against cyber crime, including calling on countries to allow remote searches if they are already carried out within the framework of national legislation.

      In a report on this agreement, the Council stated that "a new strategy is proposing (for the police and the private sector) to resort to remote inspection." <br><br>  British law already allows police to remotely access computers in accordance with the 2000 Investigation Authority Act 2000, which allows surveillance to "prevent or detect" serious crimes. " <br><br>  The spokesperson for the Police Chiefs Association (Acpo) told The Times that the police had already conducted a small number of such operations for 194 hidden inspections of dwellings, offices and hotel rooms last year. <br>  ‚ÄúThe United Kingdom agreed with the strategic approaches to tracking cyber-crimes with other EU member states, but this is not related to the current laws of the United Kingdom,‚Äù the Ministry of Internal Affairs said, adding that the plan is not binding and is not limited in time for the strategy. <br><br><h2>  "Complex Products" </h2><br>  Jacques Barrot, vice president of the European Commission, said the ruling was intended to ensure that EU countries were ready to fight cyber crime. <br><br>  Professor Peter Sommer, an expert on cyber crime at the London School of Economics, doubts that this strategy will increase the number of police hacking. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAll the products are already there, they are available for a long time and are quite complex, most likely they will not be used very widely,‚Äù he noted in a statement to the BBC. <br><br>  Most antiviruses and firewalls will detect penetration attempts, since  they are designed to prevent the launch of remote access applications and trojans that hackers and police hackers use, too, he explained. <br><br>  Professor Sommer also noted that the evidence obtained through hacking is very difficult to use in court because the prosecution is obliged to prove their authenticity. <br><br>  ‚ÄúUsually, during a judicial inspection of computers, special attention is paid to ensuring that nothing was recorded on the computer during the examination,‚Äù said Professor Sommer.  "As soon as you resort to a remote connection, it becomes uncontrollable." <br><br>  <i>And you say we have a police state.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/69561/">https://habr.com/ru/post/69561/</a></p>
