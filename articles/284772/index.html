  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sentenced in Russia's first criminal case of computer phishing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In Moscow, a sentence was pronounced on the first criminal case on computer phishing in Russia, of which more than 140 clients of a large bank became victims.  It was possible to condemn hackers with the assistance of Kaspersky Lab specialists. <br><br>  The Chertanovskiy Court of Moscow found Evgeny and Dmitry Popelyshev brothers guilty of committing crimes under Part 2 of Art.  272, Part 1 of Art.  273 and Part 4 of Art.  159 of the Criminal Code (unauthorized access to legally protected computer information, the use and distribution of malicious programs for electronic computing equipment, as well as fraud committed by a group of persons by prior agreement with causing large-scale damage). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It has been established that the brothers Evgeny and Dmitry Popelyshi, having studied the information on specialized Internet forums, as well as the basic principles of the remote banking service system, developed a plan to steal funds from the accounts of clients of one of the major Russian banks. <br><br>  For technical support, the brothers attracted a student from Kaliningrad, Alexander Sarbin, who developed a copy of the original remote banking service web page.  On this fake webpage, hackers have placed the phone numbers they rented as technical support contacts.  They also took advantage of the Trojan, which, after being activated on an infected computer, replaced some of the parameters involved in the bank-client functionality.

      As a result, any customer calls to the banking site were redirected to servers owned by hackers, where they created a fake web page.  There, the clients, unaware of the fraud, entered their personal data - a unique number, password and variable code, necessary for a one-time payment order for money transactions.  This information was kept, processed. <br><br>  In addition, as previously reported by the investigators, in order to obtain new variable codes, the attackers called customers or sent SMS messages, appearing as technical support workers and declaring the need to re-enter the variable code, referring to a software failure. <br><br>  Having received the identification data, the hackers, on behalf of the clients, sent remote orders to transfer funds from their bank accounts to the accounts of third parties controlled by themselves, after which they cashed in various ways. <br><br>  It took about a year to identify the criminals of the police and the FSB.  As noted by the SD of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the successful investigation was helped by the participation of highly qualified specialists from ZAO Kaspersky Lab in it. <br><br>  More than 170 citizens from 46 regions of Russia were recognized as victims in a criminal case.  The damage from the actions of hackers was about 13 million rubles.  In order to secure a civil action, their property was seized. <br>  The court appointed Evgeny and Dmitry Papelysham a sentence of 6 years ‚Äôimprisonment with a probation period of 5 years, as well as a fine of 450 thousand rubles each.  Alexander Sarbin was sentenced to 4 years of imprisonment with a probation period of 4 years and a fine of 200 thousand rubles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/284772/">https://habr.com/ru/post/284772/</a></p>
