Putting it in a stream of content is the easiest way, but certainly not the best. <br><br>  A new subscriber needs additional information.  How did your company evolve?  How can you help him?  How to use your service?  Answers to these questions are a long but sure path to forming a loyal audience.  Beginners need a simple instruction that will help them get up to speed as soon as possible.

      Interaction with new subscribers should begin with welcome letters that will help achieve the following goals: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Create a good first impression.</b>  A beautifully decorated welcome letter can increase brand awareness, introduce the user to the company and current offers. </li><li>  <b>Show mailing value.</b>  Tell us how often and what information the subscriber will receive from you.  Focus on the usefulness of mailing. </li><li>  <b>Continue the dialogue with the subscriber.</b>  With the help of welcome letters you can tell about all your capabilities and the quality of services provided. </li><li>  <b>Return a potential buyer.</b>  The goal of your newsletter is not only to create warm, friendly relations with the client, but also to inspire him to buy, as well as to increase the conversion. </li></ul><br>  Excellent examples of welcome letters can be seen from foreign companies, they have long understood the effectiveness and necessity of onboarding. <br><br>  For example, AirBnb gives beginners a small instruction on how to use the service: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c5b/6e9/55a/c5b6e955a6734f0fb05ec0d412b5b4a0.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><h2>  Lack of communication between the audience and content </h2><br>  As advertiser Bob Hoffman said: <blockquote>  "Modern marketing is mistaken, thinking that consumers want to interact with brands, want to have some kind of relationship with them." </blockquote><br>  People subscribe to emails for the sake of information that will help them succeed in their professional or personal life.  Unrelated messages remain unread. <br>  That is why marketers should not perceive emails as a sales channel and make mailings, focusing only on their needs, not taking into account the desires of subscribers.  Concentrate on a specific user experience and deliver relevant, relevant to the subscriber content. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff1/73d/d6e/ff173dd6eae0458d935e01e9c5d2488f.png" alt="image"><br>  Make sure that the content of your emails is what your subscribers need.  Otherwise, your messages are doomed to failure. <br><br><h2>  Late delivery </h2><br>  The distribution schedule is the key to loyal readers and, consequently, to success for your business.  People need to understand when to wait for messages, otherwise your results will be extremely inconsistent.  If you plan to check the subject of the message or the calls to action, the dispatch time is the variable you should consider. <br><br>  Notify users about the schedule during the subscription.  If you have promised to send letters every day, then keep your word.  If you are obliged to send one message per month, then it is better not to break promises. <br><br><h2>  Send messages, even if you are not asked </h2><br>  Surely you are familiar with the situation when, when registering for a webinar or downloading an e-book, in addition to the necessary content, they start sending you spam with materials that you did not ask for.  It is annoying.  According to statistics, 49% of consumers who have had a negative experience with content, say that this has seriously affected their trust in the brand. <br><br>  Remember: interaction with subscribers is a privilege, not a right. <br><br>  By giving them a choice, you show respect for their needs and create trust.  In the future, to maintain it, you will need to offer the content that your audience expects.  If you send a newsletter to those who did not subscribe to it, you ruin this trust. <br><br>  Respect your subscribers, send content that is valuable to them, and then success will not take long. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/328096/">https://habr.com/ru/post/328096/</a></p>
