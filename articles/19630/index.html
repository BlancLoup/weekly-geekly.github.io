  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rewind me please</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Imagine a classic situation ... <br>  You are dissatisfied with your organization of affairs and the distribution of time and want to finally do your projects / sports / repair.  You make a list of strategic goals and a plan, months for six, to achieve them.  Of course, you do not forget to tie each goal to a specific date.  You may even draw a Gantt chart.  It remains quite a bit - to follow the plan.  But what a bad luck: one day you didn‚Äôt get enough sleep, the other didn‚Äôt feel very good, the third - in the morning you are rude in a cafe, which reduces the pleasure from the morning dose of caffeine and irreversibly spoils the mood for the whole day.  Options - a million.  The result is one: the desire to do business is lost.  I want to transfer everything to tomorrow.  Tomorrow everything will be different, right? <br><br>  In the end, tomorrow turns into the day after tomorrow, the day after tomorrow - in a week.  The first milestone of your project is passing - naturally to no avail.  And then all the other aspirations are sucked up by the swamp of the routine.  And of course, it's like the new year / birthday here and with it comes the realization that time has passed, and nothing has been done in the desired direction.  And everything seems to be correct, but circumstances did not work out.  What's wrong?  Most likely - the problem of motivation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, motivation is a motivation for action. <br><br>  I often talk about the tendency of people to look for a magic pill.  That is some kind of universal tool that will work the same for everyone.  Just do: one, two, three - and get the result.  Unfortunately, there is no such pill.  Well, everyone is good, say lists.  But at the same time, I met people for whom keeping a to-do list is wild.  Because for them it is easy to keep in mind 10-15 tasks sorted by priorities.  I do not know how for you, for me - this is quite problematic.  Anything will be forgotten.

      The same can be said about motivation.  In general, it is divided into two types: motivation-from and motivation-to.  For example, a person begins to play sports to get rid of health problems.  That is, he is not satisfied with the current state of affairs, and he seeks to get away from him.  Or in another way: someone sees on the counter of the iPod store, and decides to take a hack, so that it becomes possible to purchase it.  He strives to possess him.  And if to speak in a simple way, then we are talking about the carrot and stick method. <br><br>  Knowing what type of work you have more efficiently (this is determined empirically), you can more productively carry out work on the organization of affairs.  One who has better motivation ‚Äî to ‚Äî you can first make a list of goals in order to understand what you should strive for.  If motivation-from works better - make a list of what you are not comfortable with at the current moment, do timekeeping. <br><br>  What helps me maintain motivation: <br><ul><li>  Goals <br>  It seems to me that to keep in mind the goals you are striving for is simply necessary.  To do this, you can make the appropriate lists and review them regularly.  The result - it becomes an order of magnitude easier to separate important matters from non-priority ones.  This helps not to get involved in the routine and constantly move in the chosen direction. <br></li><li>  Working environment <br>  I already understood that for me the number of people in the room in which I work and the level of noise practically do not matter.  However, what is really critical for me is the free space on the table: a laptop, a PDA, a notebook with a pen, nothing more.  Unnecessary items terribly distract my attention. <br><br>  In general, the influence of the working environment on productivity is well written in the book by Tom DeMarco, <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/2338486/%3Fpartner%3Ddeadline">The Human Factor</a> . <br></li><li>  Music. <br>  Probably, this is not very good, but I have a consumer attitude to music.  I am constantly looking for performers and compositions, after listening to which there is an influx of strength and energy. <br></li><li>  Video. <br>  I don‚Äôt know why, but I am just miraculously influenced by <a href="http://rutube.ru/tracks/157895.html%3Fv%3D200e9fd5570fb75d94725c677338f4c1">such videos</a> .  The only pity is that their effect is rather short-term and lasts no more than a couple of hours. <br><br>  In general, for the two previous points in NLP there is a very specific definition - an <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AF%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%258C_%2528%25D0%259D%25D0%259B%25D0%259F%2529">anchor</a> (... a means to fix and remember some feelings that will emerge at a subconscious level in a certain situation ...). <br></li><li>  Books <br>  With reading, the situation is similar to music and video, only I manage to get a more long-term effect by thinking about the ideas I have gathered. <br></li></ul><br>  One could still mention the trainings on personal development.  Although I did not participate in them, but those of my friends who visited them - noted a huge surge of strength and desire to act (and this is in addition to the knowledge gained). <br><br>  Separately, I want to note one important detail - the rest.  What does he have to do with it?  It seems to me, how many do not spur the driven horse - anyway, it will not run faster. <br><br>  What can help a particular person is quite difficult to predict.  It is important to look for, try and evaluate the result.  And, of course, you need to remember the golden rule: everything is good in moderation.  Excessive motivation interferes with work in the same way as, for example, a large amount of coffee consumed. <br><br>  Original <a href="http://deadline-as-lifestyle.blogspot.com/2008/01/blog-post_31.html">here</a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19630/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19630/</a></p>
