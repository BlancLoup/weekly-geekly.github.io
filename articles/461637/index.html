The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãone of the Saudi princes is more like a description of a project from a science fiction novel.  There will be flying taxis, sparkling sand dunes in the dark, artificial rain and much more.  For example, every night an artificial moon will rise above the city, and realistic dinosaur robots will appear in the amusement park. <br><br>  The plan for creating the city is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-princes-500-billion-desert-dream-flying-cars-robot-dinosaurs-and-a-giant-artificial-moon-11564097568">already ready, this is not just an idea</a> .  Moreover, the project has already begun to be implemented.  The project description without detailed technical documentation takes more than 2300 pages, and this document fell into the hands of the Wall Street Journal. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  True, there are not too pleasant moments there.  For example, local tribes are planned to be ‚Äúinvited‚Äù to other regions where they can lead a life similar to before.  Who does not wish to move will be moved by force.  Well, the inhabitants of the city will be "under the hood" - the state will monitor them 24/7.  All this is similar to the cities of the future from anti-utopias of various authors.

      As for the project, starting in 2017, Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud has been working on its development.  Its cost is estimated at $ 500 billion, so this is a very significant amount even for Saudi Arabia, where projects in the billions and tens of billions of US dollars are being implemented.  However, the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC">project was supported and funded by the Saudi State Investment Fund in the amount of $ 500 billion</a> . <br><br>  The project indicates that the city will be built on a desert site (in fact, almost the entire region is a sand desert), but artificial rains and irrigation systems will turn the city state if not into paradise, then into something close to this.  In any case, it will have its own agriculture, which will supply fresh food to the table of local residents.  The latter are supposed to be able to reserve tables in top-class restaurants, at least those of the locals who are not used to cooking at home. <br><br>  Actually, the project is not new, it was previously reported that this is a Saudi project of a smart and tourist cross-border city, which according to the plan should be located in the far north-west of Saudi Arabia, in Tabuk.  It should also include marine territory located at the Egyptian and Jordanian borders.  It is estimated that Neom will provide many investment opportunities in a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã26,500 km¬≤ and will extend over 460 km along the Red Sea coast.  Now there are new details of this project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/239/64c/8ef/23964c8ef81a8d817110de1e17e3cad9.jpg"><br>  <i>Muhammad ibn Salman</i> <br><br>  Together with ordinary teachers, computer holograms will be taught at schools, and the largest companies in the world will be offering jobs here.  Well, so as not to be bored, the local sands will flicker in the dark. <br><br>  According to a representative of the project development team, Neom (the city will be called that) will become the most modern settlement in the world.  The technologies that are planned to be used here will be at the forefront of science.  Part of the technology will be used to track the activities and location of each of the local residents.  In addition, law enforcement agencies will automatically receive information about the crimes committed - apparently, from the same surveillance systems that are mentioned above. <br><br>  Face recognition, biometric technology will become a daily practice for the residents of Neoma.  So, while relaxing on those very shimmering dunes, somewhere nearby there will be an observation drone that will transmit information about all the actions of a local resident or guest of the city. <br><br>  Well, genetic medicine will provide an opportunity to get "people of the future" who will be stronger and smarter than most of the living.  As far as one can understand, the Saudi prince conceived not just a city of the future, but a region in which a man of the future will appear.  It‚Äôs still difficult to judge how much all this is legitimately possible to achieve, but the Saudi princes have already implemented many different projects that initially seemed impossible. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/461637/">https://habr.com/ru/post/461637/</a></p>
