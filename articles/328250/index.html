"The Irresistible" by Adam Altera </h2><br><p></p><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ccc/cc5/89f/ccccc589f8de45be8b56b2e45711465e.jpg"></div><p></p><br><p>  The book "The Irresistible" (the original title of "Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked," was not published in Russian) is an impressive study of behavioral psychology and marketing professor Adam Alter about how various media resources are increasingly strong influence on humanity.  More and more people spend their time on social networks and for some it becomes a real problem.  Why are social networks, such as Instagram and Facebook, so attractive to people, and what explains our general dependence on social networks?  All this can be found in the book of Adam Alter. </p><br><p>  ‚Üí <a href="http://a.co/bCYRv8e" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a> </p><br><hr><br><h2>  2. ‚ÄúMove fast, disrupting things‚Äù by Jonathan Taplin </h2><br><p></p><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/31e/e45/893/31ee45893e6b4c1db894b0a5545b0af7.jpg"></div><p></p><br><p>  In the book ‚ÄúMove quickly, disrupting the order of things‚Äù (the original title is ‚ÄúMove Fast and Break Things: How Facebook, Google, and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy‚Äù was not published in Russian) Jonathan Taplin talks about how several entrepreneurs in the 90s and in the early 2000s, they created three powerful world monopolies - Google, Facebook and Amazon, which now determine the future of music, film, television and news.  Taplin tells the stories of the creators of these companies, how they have to put up with the spread of piracy on their sites in order to create a marketing monoculture in which we have to live. </p><br><p>  Since 2001, revenues of producers of cinema, music, traditional media have fallen sharply, while at the same time, Google has grown from $ 400 million to $ 75 billion.  The redistribution of money and the development of the monopoly of Internet companies poses a huge threat to society and democracy, because all power will be concentrated in a narrow circle of people interested in obtaining huge profits from the use of personal data of their users.  In his book, Jonathan Taplin offers several universal recipes that will help develop and build a business in the face of the tremendous growth of the influence of the Internet giants. </p><br><p>  ‚Üí <a href="http://a.co/dkD0BqO" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a> </p><br><hr><br><h2>  3. ‚ÄúPlan B‚Äù by Sheryl Sandberg and Adam Grant </h2><br><p></p><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/967/8f1/10b/9678f110b3eb4786801a51fb7d686380.jpg"></div><p></p><br><p>  The book "Plan B" (the original title of "Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience, and Finding Joy", was not published in Russian) was written by an amazing duet.
