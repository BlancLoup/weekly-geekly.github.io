      ... the dark sky was heavy with a beer belly on the dirty city.  The wet oxygen-free air of the fish flowed around the nine-storey buildings in search of plastic bags and men pissing on garages.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_insane/53691/">Vasily</a> hopelessly drove himself to the side of the apartment and unwanted wife.  ‚ÄúIt is not clear,‚Äù Vasily thought for some reason, at the height of the fourth floor, but the apartment with his wife inside continued to stubbornly advance. <br><br>  Zykno klatsnuv predatory castle, Basil identified the eyes of his wife, many times known to him.  ‚ÄúI was fired from the office,‚Äù the head of Vasily blurted out, not meeting expectations, exhausted by a thirst to infect the uncomplicated with his cosmic misfortune.  ‚ÄúThat is, I myself ... But they, too, had time to be the first ...‚Äù Vasily's eyes found a cupboard and began to look at him, ashamed of her craven head. <br><br>  ‚ÄúVassenka, how is it?  It can‚Äôt be completely necessary for us! ... ‚Äù- the loving Vasily and his spouse's salary constructively joined the controversy with an unfeigned squeal.  ‚ÄúYou said that a good programmer is always needed by stupid fatty merchants, and they constantly give him money for it!‚Äù The woman who was not meant for that continued to take care of the financial flows of Chinese manufacturers. <br><br>  Vasily took off his shoes, not using inappropriate hands, moved in the direction of the sofa and, reaching, fell obliquely with felled larch.  ‚ÄúGet out, fool.
