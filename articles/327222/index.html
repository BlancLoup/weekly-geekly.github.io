  <section class="page js-page"><h1>3D modeling and high performance computing (HPC) in the development of new products</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Three-dimensional modeling is increasingly being used in industry to develop and visualize new solutions, improve their quality and performance, reduce the number of defects and drastically reduce development time.  Bill Mannel, vice president of high-performance solutions in the HPE server category, talks about the role of IT infrastructure in the development of new products. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ef/61a/00b/6ef61a00be8f49439b08e6fdc481bcff.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The development of new products represents a great potential for growth of manufacturing companies, as the <a href="http://www.supplychaindigital.com/procurement/2136/The-product-life-cycle-is-in-decline">product life cycle continues to decline,</a> and companies receive an increasing share of revenues through the release of new products. <br><br>  Manufacturers are constantly looking for new strategies that will allow them to improve the product development process, bring them to market faster and take a leading position in a rapidly changing environment characterized by a high level of competition.

      <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/top-performing-manufacturers-using-simulation-in-design-phase-to-cut-costs-time-to-market-says-new-aberdeen-group-report-55824467.html">Studies have shown</a> that advanced manufacturers who regularly apply three-dimensional modeling in the early stages of product development use an average of 1.6 times less physical product prototypes, bring products to the market 158 ‚Äã‚Äãdays earlier and save up to $ 1.9 million in development compared to with companies that do not report on the use of modeling. <br><br>  Three-dimensional visualization of new products provides manufacturers with a number of advantages in the development process: <br><br><ul><li>  Products can be tested in a virtual environment, allowing developers to try thousands of product configuration options and make countless changes in the time it usually takes to create only one physical prototype. </li><li>  You can simulate the "natural" behavior of the product, identify potential problems in the functioning of the product and make changes immediately and at no additional cost. </li><li>  You can create a digital representation of the mechanisms and their individual parts to check their work and improve technical characteristics. </li><li>  Three-dimensional models allow you to quickly make changes to test new ideas and innovative solutions, while avoiding unnecessary costs of funds, time and resources. </li></ul><br>  Manufacturers who widely use the capabilities of three-dimensional modeling should invest in the development of IT infrastructures with a high degree of scalability, reliability and extensibility to perform complex tasks of modeling and analysis.  Limiting the size of models or the number of simultaneous simulations leads to delays in product development and jeopardizes the manufacturer‚Äôs competitive advantage. <br><br>  Limited performance, memory and storage space in traditional systems are no longer enough to perform the demanding modeling tasks that manufacturers face today.  <a href="https://www.hpe.com/ru/ru/solutions/hpc-high-performance-computing.html">High-performance computing technologies</a> help developers significantly improve productivity by accelerating product development, performing more complex computational tasks, and encouraging collaboration across the organization. <br><br>  GEA Ecoflex, one of the largest manufacturers of solutions for the food and energy industries, decided to expand its modeling capabilities in order to accelerate product development and ensure that its heat exchangers' lineup meets the technical requirements of customers.  By creating a two- or three-dimensional model and simulating the operation of its products in real conditions, the company <a href="http://www.esss.com.br/pdf/conteudo/case-study-simulation-driven-product-development-speeds.pdf">was able to reduce the period of development of heat exchangers from two weeks to two days</a> and achieve significant savings by reducing the number of physical prototypes. <br><br>  Customized high performance computing solutions, combining <a href="http://www.ansys.com/%3Fgclid%3DCL7_87T8pssCFQ9Zhgod5dMJKw">best-in-class software</a> and <a href="https://www.hpe.com/ru/ru/servers/density-optimized.html">powerful hardware</a> , allow you to increase productivity, create a foundation for future innovation, and help you make sound technical decisions based on data. <br><br>  In today's tough competition, manufacturers must master technologies that allow them to expand their modeling capabilities and bring products to market faster than their competitors.  Modernization of the IT infrastructure is crucial for the growth of the company, as it allows manufacturers to get the maximum benefit from the rapid market entry of their innovative products. <br><br>  <b>About the author:</b> <br><br>  <i>Bill Mannel - Vice President of Solutions for High Performance Computing, Big Data Processing and the Internet of Things in the HPE server category.</i>  <i>Responsible for developing and implementing strategies in a growing market category that includes HPE Apollo, HPE Moonshot and our new products designed for computing at the periphery of the network - the Edgeline line of servers.</i> <br><br>  Useful links: <br><br>  <b>1.</b> High Performance Computing News Webinar - <a href="http://p.brighttalk.com/hpe/ru/%3Fcommid%3D230609%26utm_source%3Dpost%26utm_medium%3Dsmm%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr">Watch the Record</a> <br>  <b>2.</b> Hewlett Packard Enterprise Acquires SGI, Strengthening Leadership in the Fast Growing Segment of Big Data Analysis and High Performance Computing Solutions - <a href="http://www8.hp.com/ru/ru/hpe-news/press-release.html%3Fid%3D2314408">Read the press release.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/327222/">https://habr.com/ru/post/327222/</a></p>
