Of course, every normal person wants this ‚Äúunfortunate step‚Äù in his work to be the last and will not be repeated. <br><br>  With ‚Äúrakes‚Äù or mental traps, you can easily cope if they lie in front of you in all its glory, without any disguise.  But this is not always the case, and often we do not see and do not understand what our mistakes are.  The purpose of this article is to get acquainted with the most "popular" mental traps that Andre Kukla described in his book. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Mental traps </h3><br><h4>  1. Perseverance </h4><br>  The first of the mental traps.  Its essence lies in the fact that we continue the work, which is obviously doomed to failure or does not give us the former pleasure.  The most typical example, we watch the most boring film, only because of stubbornness and the fact that we were taught from childhood to finish what we started.  In the end, it's just a loss of your time and a spoiled mood.

    <h4>  2. Amplification </h4><br>  This is a trap and we fall into it when we put more effort into the achievement of the goal than necessary.  The so-called endless pursuit of perfection or perfectionism.  It is also worth remembering the notorious ‚ÄúPareto principle‚Äù, the essence of which is that 20% of the work brings 80% of the result and vice versa: 80% of the work brings 20% of the result. <br><br><h4>  3. Fixation </h4><br>  When fixing our progress towards the goal is blocked.  We cannot start a business until we wait for a call, permission, inspiration, etc. <br><br><h4>  4. Reversion </h4><br>  We lost, time is gone.  But if at this stage we are still worried about the same problem, it means that we are trapped in reversion. <br>  Reversion is the temporary opposite of fixation.  When fixing, we work fiercely to speed up the onset of a frozen future.  With reversion, we strive to change the irreversible past.  Here you just have to accept it and take it for granted. <br><br><h4>  5. Advance </h4><br>  A trap we fall into starting too early.  We recycle when the same result can be achieved more easily a little later.  A typical example, a training session, when a student for a couple of weeks of preparation, performs all that is necessary according to the curriculum, which was stretched for the entire semester. <br><br><h4>  6. Resistance </h4><br>  Resistance is a disease "well, a little bit more."  Reluctance to change the course of action, under the influence of external circumstances (a bell at the door, while watching a movie or an alarm clock and we do not want to get up so much, but still have to, so there is no point in delaying it). <br><br><h4>  7. Tightening </h4><br>  We definitely decided on some business, but it is difficult for us to proceed to it.  Setting aside for later, inventing insignificant cases in order to postpone the performance of unpleasant duties. <br><br><h4>  8. Separation </h4><br>  Attention is indivisible in principle.  To work, to work, to rest, is to rest.  When on vacation we think about work and when at work we think about rest, we will not be able to do both qualitatively. <br><br><h4>  9. Acceleration </h4><br>  Acceleration is a trap that we fall into when we do something with more than necessary speed.  (Acceleration is a mirror image of a pull)  As they say, everything to fulfill life is not enough, so do not be killed on this score.  Infinity minus one is also infinite, so there‚Äôs no point in hurrying.  Acceleration will only root the habit of vanity. <br><br><h4>  10. Regulation </h4><br>  When our thought marks the fact that the door is open, we think descriptively.  When we decide that the door should be closed, we think prescriptively.  Regulation is a trap of useless prescriptions.  We fall into the regulation trap when we prescribe some behavior in a situation where the impulse would be the best conductor. <br><br><h4>  11. Formulation </h4><br>  The trap of continuously speaking our thoughts about what seems to us true. <br>  The most obvious damage caused by the formulation is that it leads to separation.  Whenever we describe or evaluate an event or experience before they end, we do two things at the same time.  On the one hand, we admire the sunset, on the other - we talk or think about it.  Separation destroys pleasure.  In fact, we cannot truly admire the sunset and at the same time evaluate it, because when we do the assessment, we distract from sensory experience.  As soon as we say: ‚ÄúOh, how wonderful it is, isn't it?‚Äù The miracle disappears. <br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br>  We constantly rely on prescriptions because we do not believe in the power of the impulse. <br>  The habit of constantly ‚Äúcontrolling the situation‚Äù - and each situation - forces us to work without rest, without giving any benefits.  In other words, she leads us into a trap and whose name is stress. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149408/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149408/</a></p>
