      <em>‚Ä¢ While the implementation of <a href="http://www.robo-hunter.com/news/3-professii-kotorie-roboti-osvaivayt-vsyo-luchshe">creative tasks</a> , including design, machines can not afford, those who work as office managers and <a href="http://www.robo-hunter.com/news/robotizirovannaya-avtomatizaciya-ubiica-rabochih-mest-v-sfere-it">in the field of IT</a> , may well lose their earnings due to robots.</em> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Robots have already captured many jobs that used manual labor, and for many decades have replaced people on production lines, but it is quite possible that very soon they will also do the <a href="http://www.robo-hunter.com/news/rabota-uhodit-k-robotam-i-belie-vorotnichki-takje-v-zone-riska">work of office workers</a> - the so-called white collar workers. <br><br>  A survey of managers of various companies shows that the world depicted in the popular series ‚ÄúPeople‚Äù, where the line between technology and man is very blurred, may well become a reality - in the very near future. <br><br>  So, 70 percent of managers are ready to consider the possibility of <a href="http://www.robo-hunter.com/tags/roboti-uje-rabotayt">using robots</a> in their team, and almost half do not mind replacing people in their team with robots. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/396/3c6/5ae/3963c65ae0df8130971b52dc9f85a84f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><br>  In the series "People" depicts a world in which the line between humans and robots is extremely blurred.  As a survey of top managers shows, in a short time, robots can become much more common in the workplace than they are today, and could do administrative work. <br><br>  The survey, conducted by <a href="http://www.expertmarket.co.uk/">Expert Market</a> , also confirms recently published data, according to which developments in the field of AI pose a threat to jobs occupied by humans. <br><br>  While creative activities, such as marketing and design, cannot be performed by robots, representatives of areas such as finance and IT, as well as office managers should consider the possibility of losing their jobs due to competition in the face of robots. <br><br><h3>  DO YOU NEED TO BE AT THE ROBOTS OF RIGHT? </h3><br>  An expert in the field of law warns that the <a href="http://www.robo-hunter.com/news/roboetika-nam-nujni-universalnie-prava-etika-i-zakonodatelstvo-dlya-robotov">legislative framework is</a> not keeping pace with the development of technology and needs to be updated in case of <a href="http://www.robo-hunter.com/news/esli-robot-ubet-cheloveka-kto-budet-vinoven">disputable situations involving robots</a> . <br><br>  He also argues that today <a href="http://www.robo-hunter.com/news/luchshie-umi-planeti-iskusstvennii-intellekt-mojet-istrebit-chelovechestvo">artificial intelligence has</a> reached maturity, and that we must begin to solve these problems before they arise, as the line between the robot and the human becomes more and more blurred. <br><br><blockquote>  "For the first time, robotics combines disparate data and the ability to cause real harm," says Ryan Calo from the University of Washington School of Law.  - Robotic systems perform tasks in such a way that their outcome is not always possible to predict in advance;  and robots also contribute to the blurring of such a fine line between man and the instrument. " <br></blockquote><br><br>  Most respondents believe that robots will perform better administrative roles ‚Äî answer phone calls, email, and write reports. <br><br>  Among the main advantages of using the work of the robot is that they will be better able to cope with the routine work, they will not go to hospital and leave. <br><br><blockquote>  A spokesman for Expert Market said the following: ‚ÄúThe results show that most people are quite normal with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãworking shoulder to shoulder with robots. Many managers are not overly worried that they may have to replace their employees with robots, and almost half of the respondents said that they will not feel guilty if they choose a robot to humans. Maybe in order to protect yourself in the future, you should learn design or something like that. " <br></blockquote><br><br>  As part of a survey on attitudes towards robots and automation, 200 top managers from various industries spoke out <br><br>  In many areas, robots are used to speed up production lines and ensure consistent quality. <br><br>  However, in early July, a robot killed a technician at a car factory after the latter hooked on an automated lever. <br><br>  Some professions are more suitable for robots than others - for example, robots can perform the duties of office managers, work in the field of IT and finance, but can not cope with creative roles or leadership positions.  In the film ‚ÄúChappie‚Äù, which also starred Hugh Jackman, robots took many jobs, including began to perform police duties. <br><br><h3>  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS ALSO DANGEROUS, LIKE NUCLEAR WEAPONS </h3><br>  Artificial intelligence can be just as dangerous for humanity as nuclear weapons, according to one of the most famous scientists of our time. <br><br>  Professor Stuart Russell, a scientist who directs leading research in the field of artificial intelligence, fears that with the rapid development of AI, humanity is "rushing towards a precipice at high speed." <br><br>  He believes that the military can use this technology in weapons, in fact, giving control over it into the hands of AI systems. <br><br>  His views coincide with the fears of other famous people, including Elon Musk, who recently spoke about the dangers of artificial intelligence. <br><br>  Professor <a href="http://www.robo-hunter.com/news/stiven-hoking-cherez-100-let-kompyteri-budut-imet-vlast-nad-chelovechestvom">Stephen Hawking</a> also joined the group of leading experts who signed an open letter warning of the need to guarantee that the AI ‚Äã‚Äãwill be used only for the benefit of mankind. <br><br>  Dr. Stuart Armstrong of the Institute for the Future of Humanity, which was founded in Oxford, also predicted that intelligent robots would soon be able to take control of entire countries. <br><br>  He believes that this is a race for time, in which it is necessary to develop protective mechanisms relating to the research of artificial intelligence, before the robots can outwit us. <br><br><blockquote>  Professor Hawking said: "The development of artificial intelligence can mean the end of the human race." <br></blockquote><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/L3mQF7GZjQU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg1MY8UNRr2b7sTrtqb4yda8p12cg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><br>  In many films in which the question of AI is raised, many jobs are occupied by robots, which allows the human race to devote more time to rest;  but, as in the series ‚ÄúPeople‚Äù, everything can remain in order until the robots have any malfunctions and become increasingly difficult to control. <br><br>  According to the survey, most managers would prefer that robots look like machines rather than people, but at the same time 68% said they would like robotics to free up more time for them. <br><br>  Executive positions <a href="http://www.robo-hunter.com/test">were deemed unsuitable for robots</a> , while 52 percent of those surveyed said they were ready to use robots for office management, 44 percent said that machines could do work in IT, and 28 percent said they were ready to use robots in areas of finance. <br><br>  Only 15 percent of respondents were concerned that robots could take over the world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/311/7ea/cd2/3117eacd24336ac7fc907d994fa9724c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The graph shows the types of work that, in the opinion of respondents, could be performed by robots, with answers to calls and administrative activities most likely, then the list includes typing, replies to emails and reporting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ff4/0cd/798/ff40cd7985419d3d985418078fd016dc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Managers were asked to name the main benefits of <a href="http://www.robo-hunter.com/news/roboti-na-rabochih-mestah">using robots in the workplace</a> , while most often respondents said that they would not take the sick-cars and would perform tasks according to a single standard. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/366283/">https://habr.com/ru/post/366283/</a></p>
