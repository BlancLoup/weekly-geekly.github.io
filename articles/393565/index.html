  <section class="page js-page"><h1>In pursuit of speed. New SD Card Standards: Now Supports 8K Video Recording</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Hi, Giktayms!</b>  Having accepted SD as a single standard for memory cards, manufacturers began to actively modernize their designs.  Since the release of the first drives of this format in 2000, several of its generations have been released: SD 1.0, SD 1.1, SDHC and SDXC.  They differ in the maximum possible capacity - up to 2 GB in SD 1.0 and a maximum of 2 TB in SDXC.  By the way, the last standard appeared in 2009, that is, in nine years the theoretical capacity of cards has increased 1024 times.  Along with the volume went the improvement of other characteristics, the most important of them - the recording speed.  And now presents new standards that allow you to shoot in 8K resolution. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/274966/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/58f/7ca/e70/58f7cae707e24e4682837577d9e507b7.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Who is ordering music?  The non-profit organization <b>SD Card Association</b> establishes specifications for flash drives and closely monitors their compliance with manufacturers.  Until recently, there were six categories.  These are C2, C4, C6, C10, U1 and U3.  The numbers show the minimum write speed: C2 - 2 Mb / s, C6 - 6 Mb / s, and so on.  The letter U stands for Ultra High Speed: U1 - 10 Mb / s, U3 - 30 Mb / s.  The actual parameters of the drive can be higher, then you are lucky with the drive.  Capabilities in the video directly depend on the class of the card.  For example, C4 and C6 allow you to record in Full HD resolution (1080p), but photographing at the time of shooting will not work - the speed of the card will not be enough.  This option appears with a C10 or U1 standard card.  Category U3 allows you to shoot in 4K and, until recently, it was the fastest card. <br><br>  Now the SD Card Association in the SD Card 5.0 protocol adds a new designation class - VSC (Video Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãClass).  Cards of this standard will be marked with the letter "V".  The system also affects old card formats, so confusion may arise.  Bring clarity: there are five fresh notation - V6, V10, V30, V60 and V90.  V6 equals C6, V10 is the same speed as in C10 and in U1.  The writing speed on a card with the V30 index is at least 30 Mb / s, that is, it is the same with U3.

      V60 and V90 have nothing to do with Volvo cars - these are new memory cards with a high write speed and previously they did not stand out in a separate class.  V60 allows you to record data at a speed of 60 Mb / s, V90 - 90 Mb / s.  They open access to video in the resolution of 8K (7680x4320 pixels).  Things to do: find a camera that supports this resolution.  Despite the fact that the 4K format is already commonplace for so many action cameras, the mass appearance of 8K will take more than one or two years.  Although the pace of development of technologies is also not worth discounting: first, relatively low-cost cameras will appear, and after them the popularity of televisions and monitors with support for ultra-high resolutions will soar to the skies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/688/dfd/36c/688dfd36ca2e43c5b6f51368ca56f764.jpg"><br><br>  SD cards work on the NAND type of flash memory.  This is a three-dimensional array that allows you to place cells more compact compared to the previously used NOR architecture.  At the same time, access to sectors is more complicated.  The NOR memory chip was introduced by Intel in 1988.  The format is called the markup of stored data - NOT OR (‚Äúnot or‚Äù).  The peculiarity of the type lies in the high speed of access to information.  The principle of reading data does not imply a consistent reference to it.  The peculiarity of the NOR-structure is the random access to any sector with information.  This is necessary in situations in which data is read in random order.  NOR-type memory is sometimes used in mobile devices for the functioning of the operating system and the BIOS in computers. <br><br>  Memory NAND (NOT AND, "not and") appeared later.  Its key difference from NOR is that data is read not arbitrarily, but sequentially.  All data is collected in blocks.  This led to some features of such a memory.  Firstly, the NAND type does not know how to access a specific byte, in contrast to the NOR memory ‚Äî only blocks.  Secondly, reading is faster than writing information.  At the moment, NAND-memory is actively developing and getting rid of its main drawback - the difference in speed between writing and reading data.  This type of memory is now used almost everywhere where information is entered sequentially - in digital cameras, smartphones, tablets, navigators and other gadgets.  The development of NAND-type allows you to increase the speed of data recording, which makes it possible to work with ultra-high-resolution video.  This explains the introduction of new V6-V30 formats.  Their write speed will be higher than in U1-U3 standard cards precisely because of more advanced NAND memory. <br><br>  Increased recording speed and new classes have a positive effect not only on 4K-8K shooting.  Before them, by and large, it is necessary to live.  But what is commonly used right now is Full HD.  Here the V60 and V90 standards will come in handy in slow motion when the mode is 120 frames per second.  Over the same period compared to shooting in Full HD / 60fps, a larger amount of information is recorded, and the speed of entering information on the memory card plays a significant role.  New classes of speed allow you to transfer more movement in the frame, moreover, the probability of missing a fragment of movement is almost eliminated.  This is useful in, for example, records of sporting events and other dynamic scenes - even though the cheetah is chasing an antelope in a program about wildlife. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b4e/031/f7d/b4e031f7dafa461796eb6ddddcbcd548.png"><br><br>  It is important to take into account the volume of the card.  For example, the GoPro HERO4 Black Edition camera will fit only 2 hours 13 minutes of video in Full HD at 120 frames per second, and reducing the frame rate to sixty, respectively, will allow you to record almost four and a half hours of video.  Depending on the camera settings, one second of such video can take up to 30 MB in volume, and the card recording speed should be high - not lower than V30, and just in case better than V60.  The familiar Full HD at 60 frames per second also comes out rather big, and slow cards may not have time to bring such amount of streaming information. <br><br>  The new standards apply to all types of SDHC and SDXC SD card generations.  The classification for miniSD and microSD is the same.  V60 and V90 are created with a large margin for the future, and the speeds of the standards V6-V30 are actively used.  The format of SD-drives is developing, this is evidenced by the modernization of the NAND-type of memory and the work on increasing the write speeds.  Let's see how long it takes for manufacturers to implement the fastest standards in their products. <br><br>  Thank you for your attention and stay with <b>Kingston</b> on Hiktatimes! <br><br>  For more information about Kingston and HyperX products, visit <a href="http://www.kingston.com/ru">the company's official website</a> .
