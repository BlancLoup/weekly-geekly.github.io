On the one hand, such a process requires a large one-time mobilization of the efforts of children from different teams, but on the other hand, it gives the opportunity for quick large hiring.  FunCorp organizes such a Hiring event for QA engineers on March 16 in Moscow, then I will talk about this format in more detail, and also touch on the cost of living issues in Moscow so that interested readers from other cities can ‚Äúask the price‚Äù. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Typically, such activities are carried out in two stages: first, applicants perform a test task, and those who have successfully completed it receive an invitation to the office.  We are waiting for candidates from both Moscow and other cities.  For candidates from other cities are paid flight and hotel.  Several interviews are conducted throughout the day, and at the end of the day a successful candidate receives an offer. <br><br>  <b>More information about the event and stages can be found by clicking on the <a href="http://funcorphiring.com/">link</a> .</b> <b><br></b> <br>  A significant proportion of candidates come from other cities, and I would like to tell you more about how to ask and decide to move, and what the company usually helps to make this process as convenient as possible.  Directly with the move itself, companies often help by offering a relocation package. <br><br>  <b>Conditions for moving at FunCorp:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Compensation of tickets for the relocation of the employee and his family members; </li><li>  Compensation of temporary housing for a week (for idle budget - 25,000 rubles, for family budget - 35,000 rubles); </li><li>  Lump-sum payment on arrangement - one monthly salary; </li><li>  Support and care of the People Operations team from the first minute after the offer.  We have a telegram chat where you can ask any question (districts, schools, shops, etc.). </li></ul><br>  Much more difficult to ask the price and decide on the move.  We often received questions about the cost of living in Moscow from the children we were transporting, and therefore we decided to make a small cheat sheet for the future.  We did it together with our QA engineers. <br><br>  <b>The main expenses in Moscow are as follows (prices are in rubles):</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Accommodation (for rent): 35,000 - 40,000 (Good odnushka on m. River Station within walking distance, on a straight green line, 20 minutes to the office on m. Belorusskaya) </li><li>  Communal - 3,000 </li><li>  Products and household chemicals - 20,000 </li><li>  Clothing (a pair of jeans or sneakers) - 5,000 </li><li>  Directions (metro) - 2,200 (monthly pass) </li><li>  Directions (taxi) - 2,000 (5 different trips) </li><li>  Telephone, Internet - 1,500 </li><li>  Entertainment (coffee shops, restaurants, cinemas) - 9,000: </li></ul><br><ul><li>  2 times in the movie - 1,000 </li><li>  2 times a coffee house - 1,500 </li><li>  1 time restaurant - 3,000 </li><li>  Zoo - 500 </li><li>  Concert - 3,000 </li></ul><br>  Total: <b>77,700 rubles per month</b> for constant monthly expenses. <br><br>  Do not forget about variable costs: vacation, household appliances, and so forth. <br><br>  By the way, there is still an excellent resource <a href="https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Moscow"><b>Numbeo</b></a> .  On it you can learn about the cost of living, housing indicators, medicine, crime, including the cost of living in Moscow: <br><br><ul><li>  A single person monthly costs: 38 381.56.36 rub without rent </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Rent Per Month: </li></ul><br>  - Apartment (1 bedroom) in City Center 57,716.62 rub <br>  - Apartment (1 bedroom) Outside of Center ,7 33,763.16 <br><br>  Total: 72,000 rubles per month, which is close with our calculation of 77,700. <br><br>  If you have a family of several people, then new scenarios appear. <br>  Most likely, you are already considering the option of a two-room apartment, and at the same River Station the price will be in the range of 40,000 - 50,000.  (The most complete and proven database of rental apartments on the <a href="https://www.cian.ru/">link</a> ).  On the other hand, the total income is also increasing, since in Moscow there is a big chance to find a job for both.  According to Rosstat for 2018, the average salary in Moscow was about 80,000 rubles per month.  If two people work, the cost of growth grows less than the total income increases, which means that it is easier to save for a mortgage or pay a mortgage loan. <br><br>  We talked in some detail about the costs, and now we would like to mention that the majority of IT companies offer a social package that compensates for a number of expenses (food, sports, medicine, training, etc).  FunCorp is no exception. <br><br>  <b>Our social package:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  LCA, including dentistry </li><li>  Fitness compensation 40,000 r. </li><li>  Macbook or iMac to choose from </li><li>  Breakfast and lunch at the office </li><li>  Training budget of 50,000 p. </li><li>  Payment for participation in Russian and foreign conferences </li><li>  Participation in FunTech own meetings </li><li>  Team Building Budget 4,500 r.  per quarter </li><li>  Corporate events </li><li>  Bonus at birth </li><li>  Birthday gift </li></ul><br>  But what our employees who have already moved say about moving to Moscow (by the way, the ratio in our office of Muscovites and non-Muscovites is 1: 3): <br><br>  <b>Mikhail (Novosibirsk)</b> : <i>‚ÄúMoscow is a concentrated city.</i>  <i>And it's not just about money and traffic jams.</i>  <i>Here are going to people who have decided to change something, who do not want to stand still.</i>  <i>People with grandiose plans and burning eyes, going far forward.</i>  <i>And when they get together, really incredible things happen.</i>  <i>I want to be in such an environment where it will be almost impossible to stop.</i>  <i>And there is only one road - forward! ‚Äù</i> <i><br></i> <br>  <b>Ilya (Ulyanovsk)</b> : <i>‚ÄúThere is a huge potential for development in any area of ‚Äã‚Äãinterest.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The opportunity to work with the best people on global projects and learn from them. ‚Äù</i> <i><br></i> <br>  <b>Vladimir (Penza)</b> : <i>‚ÄúI have a short, actually) I moved, because</i>  <i>in my city there are simply no companies left with interesting projects in which I would like to work.</i>  <i>Usually in regional cities you are limited to 1-2 companies in general. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  We are waiting for all those who are interested in our Hiring Event on March 16.  If you have any questions, we will be happy to answer them in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441306/">https://habr.com/ru/post/441306/</a></p>
