  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Welcome to the Alawar blog</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello to all users <br>  Today we open the corporate blog Alawar on Habr√©.  For those who do not know, we are engaged in publishing and distribution of video games of the popular casual format. <br><br>  A publishing house is a producer expertise, financing a game project and packaging a product in accordance with all the requirements of the geimindustry.  It is on the side of the publisher that the localization, testing, and vrapping of the game takes place with the protection system.  Now we are publishing games on 17 platforms, including PC, Mac, iOS, Android, consoles, social networks, etc. We have already created more than 280 of our own games, and plan to do even more. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f7d/24a/ed0/f7d24aed0d169767ceb89a6a605d15c8.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We develop distribution on 30 of our own sites, as well as access to our games for customers is provided by 1,500 partners around the world (here we consider both web partners and hardware vendor presets for devices), about 50 connected billing systems, and as a result we distribute almost petabyte distros per month. <br><br>  As a result, we have accumulated a lot of experience in the technological sphere - both the production of games and the organization of a technological distribution platform.  We are actively experimenting with technology.  We find new platforms under which to write games, and we port our best products there.  We are often the pioneers of Russian gamedev at these sites.

      From the latest news, the most interesting is, perhaps, the new and still ‚Äúexotic‚Äù platforms that we have studied as an experiment. <br><ol><li>  For us, a great event is the release of Farm Frenzy 2 (aka Farm Frenzy 2) on Windows Phone 7. Not only the platform is interesting here, but also the fact that we published from Microsoft Game Studios. </li><li>  The first game from Russian developers on PS Vita is our Treasures of Montezuma. </li><li>  We are also mastering the Kindle platform, having released more than 10 games already, we are conducting various marketing experiments. </li><li>  They released "Montezuma" on the Release Candidate Windows 8. The game for the first week in WinStore collected more than 10 thousand races. </li><li>  We are also actively working with HTML5 and released our ‚ÄúTanchiki‚Äù as one of the first Russian games in the Chrome Web Store. </li></ol><br>  This blog is an initiative of those Alawar employees who are responsible for the technical implementation of our games: meeting the requirements of platform holders, forming technical requirements for games on different platforms, ensuring uninterrupted operation of servers under load, payment systems, protection systems, etc.  Plus, it seems to us an interesting idea to connect sometimes to the content of this blog of artists of our games - specialists from our studios have a great experience with 2D and 3D graphics, this topic is very interesting for readers of Habra. <br><br>  Once a week we will issue an extended technological article, post-mortem.  They will not have water, but will only concentrate on the experience of a whole team of our developers, administrators, technical producers, porters.  We will sharpen texts so that they are useful not only to game studios, but to the widest possible circle of technical specialists.  And in the breaks between large articles, we will publish some interesting news about the gaming industry, about conferences, about our life, i.e.  We will write about something gaming. <br><br>  Here are the next announcements: <br><ul><li>  Our web-department will soon publish a post on how to deploy multiple versions of sites on the same YII instance. </li><li>  The system administration department is already working on the text about server migration without stopping sites. </li><li>  Our experience publishing applications for Windows 8. </li></ul><br>  If you have any suggestions, ideas, suggestions, we will be very happy to read them in the comments. <br><br>  - Alexander Pogrebnyak, <br>  Technical Director Alawar </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153087/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153087/</a></p>
