  <section class="page js-page"><h1>5 million accounts have already been registered in ProtonMail cryptographic mail.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/th/le/pi/thlepilz3opbk2a_1kaoduiyztq.png" align="left">  In 2013, employees of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), with the participation of colleagues from Harvard University and MIT, developed <a href="https://protonmail.com/">ProtonMail</a> , an encrypted mail service.  He is in Switzerland.  According to the <a href="https://protonmail.com/about">developers</a> , the service is protected from the actions of American and European laws, primarily from the control of the NSA.  The main goal is to ensure security and respect for the privacy of users.  In a sense, ProtonMail was a response to the closure of Lavabit cryptomail after the <a href="https://habr.com/post/223649/">attack of the American special services on its creator, Ladar Levison</a> .  The Swiss company Proton Technologies AG is not subject to US law, which minimizes the likelihood of such a scenario. <br><br>  In September 2018, ProtonMail reached a significant milestone: <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/49041-protonmail-ceo-andy-yen-interview">5 million registered users</a> .  ‚ÄúWe want you to be able to completely de-gleify your life,‚Äù said co-founder and CEO, Andy Yen, in <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/49041-protonmail-ceo-andy-yen-interview">an interview</a> with <i>Inverse</i> .  - ProtonMail provides all the [necessary] functions, as well as security and privacy that Google cannot provide.  This is our long-term vision. ‚Äù  In addition to mail, encryption of documents, spreadsheets and everything else will appear in the future. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Open beta testing of ProtonMail <a href="https://habr.com/post/223809/">began in 2014</a> .  ProtonMail messages are not stored openly on servers, but are encrypted on the client side.  Two passwords are used for authorization: one for logging into the account and downloading encrypted data, the second for decrypting.  Password recovery for decryption is impossible; if it is lost, the correspondence cannot be recovered.  At that time, ProtonMail was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hollieslade/2014/05/19/the-only-email-system-the-nsa-cant-access/">called the</a> only mail service to which the NSA could not access. <br><br>  Against the background of the current privacy situation on the Internet, cryptographic services like ProtonMail are very relevant.  For example, the <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore%3Fdate%3D2014-01-17%25202018-09-17%26q%3DProtonMail">dynamics of search queries</a> shows a serious increase in the popularity of ProtonMail in the period from 2014 to 2018.  According to Yen, from January 2017 to September 2018, the number of ProtonMail accounts increased from 2 million to 5 million. Some well-known journalists who write on information security topics <a href="https://followerwonk.com/bio%3Fhmac%3Dd6e86342e7654ce9571e65512441b78c83112e6f%26q%3Dprotonmail.com%26ts%3D1537200698%26s%3Dsocial_authority">indicate that</a> <code>@protonmail.com</code> mailboxes: this also contributes to the popularity of the service.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y1/qv/in/y1qvinkfljeefpw9cbcbiyyzngs.png"><br><br>  Interestingly, Google has been <a href="https://habr.com/post/398581/">hiding ProtonMail from search results</a> for ‚Äúsecure email‚Äù, ‚Äúencrypted email‚Äù, etc. for a long time.  For example, the table below shows the search positions for ProtonMail for ‚Äúsecure email‚Äù and ‚Äúencrypted email‚Äù requests, as of the beginning of August 2016 in the main search engines.  Everywhere the first or second page, except Google, in which ProtonMail was not ranked at all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9df/30c/b44/9df30cb44fedefe916705af1bcf0336a.png"><br><br>  Only after the publication of the problem, Google ‚Äúfixed the bug‚Äù, although it did not disclose the details of exactly what this ‚Äúbug‚Äù was. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/99a/70e/85c/99a70e85cce6b3400e5073c1810a54ab.png"><br><br>  ‚ÄúThis case tells us about a previously unnoticed danger, which is called‚Äú search risk ‚Äù(Search Risk).  The crux of the problem is that any competing service, such as ProtonMail, can be easily suppressed by search engines or by the government that controls these search engines.  This can happen everywhere, regardless of state borders.  For example, even considering that Google is an American company, it controls more than 90% of European search traffic.  In our case, Google was the reason that ProtonMail‚Äôs global growth was 25% less for almost 10 months, the <a href="https://protonmail.com/blog/search-risk-google/">developers wrote in the official blog</a> .  ‚ÄúThe only reason we survived and we write this story is that ProtonMail became so widely known, word of mouth, and our community was too big to ignore.  Many other companies are less lucky. " <br><br>  Of course, it is difficult to compare the popularity of ProtonMail and Gmail with 1.2 billion accounts.  But today, end-to-end encryption is the only way to protect your email messages from prying eyes, including from large Internet companies that scan email traffic, analyze email content and perform user profiling to show them relevant Internet advertising. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/le/rs/qw/lersqw8lokagyu31aksbfhwpgla.jpeg"></a> <br>  <i><font color="gray">Traceroute from Turkey to protonmail.com passes, but the site does not open</font></i> <br><br>  ProtonMail and related <a href="https://protonvpn.com/">ProtonVPN</a> (free VPN) are faced with opposition not only from major Internet companies.  Periodically, servers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/27/protonmail-suffers-ddos-attack-that-takes-its-email-service-down-for-minutes/">are subject to DDoS attacks</a> , and in some countries this access is blocked at the state level.  For example, in March 2018, the Turkish authorities <a href="https://protonmail.com/blog/turkey-online-censorship-bypass/">blocked access</a> to protonmail.com.  Turkish telecommunications companies use <a href="https://dyn.com/blog/turkish-internet-censorship/">DNS poisoning</a> , disguising their servers as Google DNS resolvers, as well as other methods of blocking. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iz/km/nj/izkmnjvxegpnpzfi6oly_ejkbja.jpeg"><br>  <font color="gray"><i><font color="gray">Graffiti in Istanbul, <a href="https://dyn.com/blog/turkish-internet-censorship/">source</a></font></i></font> <br><br>  In Russia, access to ProtonMail and a free service to circumvent <a href="https://protonvpn.com/">ProtonVPN</a> censorship is not difficult <a href="https://protonvpn.com/">yet</a> . <br><br>  The situation with the violation of privacy on the Internet is such that cryptographic services are becoming a matter of prime need for ordinary users, just as TLS-certificates and HTTPS traffic encryption become an integral attribute of any web site. <br><br>  <i>Note</i>  ProtonMail is the most famous, but not the only secure mail service.  A complete list of mail servers with encryption scores can be found <a href="https://dismail.de/serverlist.html">here</a> .  According to security assessments, Mailbox.org and Posteo.de are currently leading in this list.  In fifth place is Tutanota, in seventh place - ProtonMail. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/05/o-/dv/05o-dvkzspbevqklw-adprboggo.png"></a> <br>  <font color="gray"><i><font color="gray">Click to view full ranking as of 09/18/2018</font></i></font> <br><br><hr><br> <a href="https://clck.ru/EFgck"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kx/0f/mf/kx0fmfjomyxkckip9bo1l48sxsq.jpeg"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/423729/">https://habr.com/ru/post/423729/</a></p>
