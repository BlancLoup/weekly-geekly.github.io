      And now to the point. <br><br><h2>  What did you do before Intel? </h2><br>  In 1993, I graduated from the Physical and Technical Institute with a specialist in quantum radiophysics, defended my thesis in postgraduate studies in quantum optics, spent a year in Germany as postdoc, worked in Nizhny Novgorod for a couple of years, and then joined Intel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/368/4d3/724/3684d372401d31122125acef5fc096b9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  How did you get into Intel? </h2><br>  I came to Intel in 2000, when the company opened its first R &amp; D site in Russia, in Nizhny Novgorod.  I came to the company as a senior engineer in the direction of DSP, then I had a couple of my projects, after which I moved to a division that was engaged in research in the field of wireless technologies and the development of WiFi and WiMAX products.  Now I work as a technical policy manager, my area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility includes innovative projects with strategic partners and work with ministries, departments and all our partners, both industrial and various organizations, associations that contribute to the development of the market and the entire habitat for WiMAX and other promising technologies. <br><br><h2>  Why is Intel? </h2><br>  I worked in this industry for a Russian company, and it became interesting for me to participate in truly large projects that are possible only in a large company. <br><br><h2>  What does your work day look like? </h2><br>  Three days a week I come to the office, write documents and articles, work with the mail.  On one of the days, if it turns out this way, I try to postpone four or five meetings in the city, no longer coming to the office.  And one day a week I work from home - I do almost the same thing as in the office, but I do not need to spend two hours on the road.  With the advent of the WiMAX network, I had the opportunity to work almost anywhere in Moscow without getting out of my car.  My working day starts in different ways, but it usually ends after midnight. <br><br><h2>  A new wireless internet standard, WiMAX 2, is being developed. </h2><br>  Yes, now IEEE 802.16m standard is being prepared, this is the next generation of WiMAX.  Official adoption of the standard is planned for mid-2010.  One of the main innovations is the mandatory support of the channel width of 20 MHz and work both in the time and frequency duplex.  There will probably be questions about it - perhaps readers will want to understand the difference between WiMAX 2 and LTE, because it makes sense to compare these two technologies directly. <br><br><h2>  802.16.2-2004 and 802.16e-2005 are not compatible in their technical specifications? </h2><br>  Yes, there are two different protocols, fixed access - 16d and mobile access - 16e.  Moreover, the differences affect both the channel level and the physical level.  The 16e technology uses a more complex frequency multiplexing method - OFDMA, and due to this it is possible to more efficiently use the spectral band.  Also in the mobile access function is implemented to transfer a mobile subscriber from one base station to another without loss of connection (handover).  And here it is important to note that the full implementation of this function requires not only appropriate innovations in the access protocol, but also a serious modernization of the operator‚Äôs infrastructure. <br><br><h2>  A completely consumer question - is it possible to deploy a WiMAX network arbitrarily? </h2><br>  Here is the moment - if you can afford to buy a Wi-Fi router, then you cannot afford to buy a WiMAX router.  In order for you to use WiMAX technology, you must have an operator license (this is from a regulatory point of view), that is, you must have frequencies, you must have a huge package of all sorts of papers, permits and approvals, starting from the State Radio Frequency Commission, The radio frequency center, which makes the examination, in which channels and in which locations you can use WiMAX, and ending with the Rossvyaznadzor, which comes at the end and says: ‚ÄúSo, you have deployed, and now let's see if you made all the rules  but. "  That is, WiMAX is, as I said above, carrier technology is not at all private, and this is only one, but its important difference from Wi-Fi technology. <br><br><h2>  So you work with all these officials and promote the standard? </h2><br>  Rather, the development and promotion of Russian regulatory documents.  This is one of my key projects, but far from the only one. <br><br><h2>  Is there any resistance, pressure from their side? </h2><br>  You know, probably a sin to complain.  If you look at world practice, then Russia, I‚Äôm not afraid of these words, in terms of WiMAX ahead of the rest: we have all three bands set by the WiMAX forum, which are 2.3, 2.5 and 3.5 GHz.  Moreover, the 2.3 range, and after the August meeting of the GKRCH and 2.5 GHz, is open for the deployment of the mobile WiMAX version.  Certain issues remain in the 3.5 GHz band, but there are specific difficulties there, since this band is used in Russia by fixed satellite communications, which has a higher priority for the state.  By and large, the only problem remains the lack of a free frequency resource for building new networks. <br><br><h2>  The question that arises in everyone who uses Yota - people complain about the problem with the houses, that the house is blocked by a signal, and a person who has fallen into a sleeping area - on the map it may be marked as completely covered, but in fact there will be no connection.  How to deal with it, what does Yota do about this and will WiMAX 2 solve these problems? </h2><br>  You know, I would share these problems.  The question of the new standard, which will be adopted only next year, is a separate topic.  It is clear that all equipment manufacturers and those companies that implement WiMAX are waiting for this standard to appear, and, most likely, will pick up this technology and release their products from the very beginning - but this is a matter of the future, and I do not expect commercial products based on standard before 2011.  I don‚Äôt want to talk about Yota‚Äôs plans regarding the implementation and upgrade of the system to support the 16m standard, but it‚Äôs clear that such an upgrade will require some additional resources. <br><br><h2>  But will Yota be easier, because by this time there will already be a ready infrastructure? </h2><br>  Yes, in terms of infrastructure, the 16m standard is no different from the 16e. <br><br>  Returning to the current problems of coverage, I would compare the situation of what is now happening with WiMAX, with the advent of GSM in Russia.  If you remember, the first GSM networks appeared in the mid-nineties, and for five or six years we regularly looked at the coverage map of Moscow - is there a network, no network?  This is quite a natural childhood growth disorder - no operator can afford to build a complete network from scratch, turn it on, and only then begin to provide services.  Now WiMAX networks are built in the first approximation.  It has a fairly large number of base stations, but their number is that of Comstar, that Yota has so far significantly less than the number of base stations of our GSM operators - at least in Moscow.  The first 3-4 years, cellular operators built base stations, plugged holes in the coating, fixed radio planning problems in places where interference occurs - some house is blocking something, or some new building is beginning to block something.  Before the situation when WiMAX networks are absolutely ripe and they just need to be supported, far enough - I think that in two years it will definitely go away.  Nevertheless, I can quite authoritatively tell you that Yota and Comstar now cover more than 80% of the city - if we are talking about Moscow. <br><br><h2>  Tell me, when will the bright future come, in which we all will use WiMAX-phones or some wonderful new technologies that will cancel GSM - say, a kind of mobile VoIP through several different protocols? </h2><br>  You know, I remember VoIP seminars and conferences on the Internet, dating back to 1996.  VoIP is probably one of the first killer applications lying on the surface of using IP, by and large VoIP is already ‚Äúin place‚Äù - please take it and use it.  At the same time, forecasts were such that another two or three years, and regular telephony would die.  But this did not happen either then or now, and therefore it is a thankless task to make plans for the future. <br><br>  Look here.  Consumers are always trying to find a more optimal, cheaper and more affordable service.  It is clear that when we go to another country, we need to either buy a local SIM-card, or watch how our account is rapidly melting in international roaming.  Naturally, in such a situation we want to use VoIP - and this is the only alternative, if you need to talk about work or for a long time.  The population can be divided into two parts: 5-10 percent are early adopters, people who are interested in everything new.  The first phone came out with a Yota 4G - a thousand dollars worth it, but it's okay, I wonder, they buy.  However, 90% of the population, and even more, are arranged differently - they have a home phone, a cell phone, and a clear social circle: neighbors, friends, and this is enough for them.  Of course, everyone wants to have something cheaper and more interesting, but the trigger does not work - to give up one technology in favor of another does not work yet, no one can take over and change GSM for VoIP overnight. <br><br>  VoIP is developing all the time, almost all corporations use VoIP when communicating between offices in different countries and different cities.  In Intel, all internal telephony is packaged in IP.  These two technologies ‚Äî switched and packet-based ‚Äî exist in parallel, so in order to say that at some point people will begin to abandon traditional telephony, you need to get some sort of critical mass of VoIP users, and this critical mass is not ten and not twenty percent.  When the situation is 50 to 50, then it will be possible to seriously talk about the end of GSM.  And now the share of VoIP is still within 10-15%. <br><br>  In addition, there are regulatory barriers, and where they come from is also understandable.  Traditional fixed and mobile telephony operators are fighting for their business.  If you now go and try to lobby for VoIP operators, equal to other operators, access to the M9, nothing will come of it - VoIP will simply not be allowed there, because our cellular majors have a serious lobby and they will guard their business to the last.  Of course, this whole situation will end up with the fact that the old operators are transforming - companies that are rich, experienced, they manage to get out of this situation, and when VoIP starts to win, they will be the first to raise this technology to the banner - this is how the business works. <br><br><h2>  That is, as soon as we see that the well-known cellular majors are transforming into VoIP companies, then this will be a signal that this point is close? </h2><br><br>  I think this will be one of the indicators.  Look what happens.  Operators are becoming universal.  Vimpelcom bought Golden Telecom.  Golden Telecom previously bought a lot of regional assets.  In the same Lower, I have friends who worked in a small alternative operator, then Golden Telecom bought them in 2006, and VimpelCom bought them all a year ago.  The same stories take place everywhere: say, Corbin bought Golden in Moscow, then they moved to VimpelCom.  What does this mean?  The fact that large operators are gaining packages of various communication and access technologies.  Major money and VimpelCom, and MTS still brings voice GSM-traffic, but now these operators are overgrown with various side businesses.  This allows them to be more flexible, it allows them to more easily transform to the immediate needs of the market, and, ultimately, to form these requests themselves.  Having several alternative technologies in your portfolio, you feel much more confident than when you rely on only one technology, even if it‚Äôs super profitable at the moment. <br><br>  .................................................. .............................................. <br><br>  <b>Agree, interesting!?</b>  But it may be even more interesting!
