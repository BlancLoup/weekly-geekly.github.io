A piece of paper that had just been plucked from a branch glowed, slowly losing its radiance as it died out.  With a pleasant even light, the hand of the local clergyman was shining after the prayer service, but for some reason the light circle was breaking and fading away after quiet silent troubles at home. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4c8/1eb/721/4c81eb721bc155d6dee3465331185ab2.gif"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  It was found that those who suffered from one disease or another had a strictly defined change in the structure of the luminous crown - the luminescence of a sick person suddenly changed: there appeared dark spots, spots, a once-flat field turned into torn pieces.  It is curious that in some cases it was possible to fix this change even before the first symptoms of the disease appeared ... ‚Äù

      In many pseudoscientific publications, the Kirlian effect is mentioned as allegedly proving the existence of a so-called ‚Äúbiofield‚Äù or ‚Äúaura‚Äù.  However, since it is observed only when an external source of high-frequency voltage acts on the body, it is reasonable to assume that the Kirlian effect has nothing to do with the ‚Äúbiofield‚Äù. <br><br>  Over time, with the physical essence of the "Kirlian effect," scientists figured out.  Of course, the photos do not glow human biofield.  After all, a similar glow arises around an ordinary nail.  Exaggerating, we can say that the pulsed electromagnetic field in which the photographing takes place, pulls electrons and photons from the object under study, which create a radiant crown.  But if the luminescence of objects is always constant, then the luminescence of a person and other biological objects changes, depending on some deep processes going on in the body. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dd8/71e/5ec/dd871e5ecbbdc416e22741c47e57fa78.gif" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b5e/473/57b/b5e47357bd68ae6237280c7552fa9c44.gif" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/75f/bfa/68a/75fbfa68a4e516becf235a49cb0d2bd9.gif"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/82e/267/214/82e2672141e492b6cb3919b56017f3d1.gif"><br><br>  Comparing the halos of healthy and sick people, scientists have learned from the pictures of the discharge on ten fingers to draw conclusions about the state of all human organs.  Of course, the device is unlikely to make an accurate diagnosis.  For example, he will report that the subject has liver problems.  Moreover, it will do it long before the person feels the symptoms of the disease.  Not without reason, these devices work already in 63 countries of the world, including the USA and all Europe. <br><br>  There are still many ‚Äúmyths‚Äù about the prospects for using Kirlianography ‚Äî it can also look into a person‚Äôs soul.  It is called the only way in the world to objectively assess the psychological characteristics of a person in general, and the current psychological state in particular.  It seems that, together with the Ministry of Internal Affairs, an approach has been developed that makes it possible to identify people prone to illegal actions. <br>  Even such perspectives as reading information from the brain of a deceased person are considered.  It is said that at the end of the 80s, similar work was carried out at the Research Institute of the USSR KGB.  Researchers shot an encephalogram from a dead man, and then tried to extract useful information from it.  What ended the experiments is unknown.  But, maybe, this seemingly fantastic task will someday be solved. <br><br>  But perhaps the most surprising feature of the Kirlian effect is its ability to accurately determine which external influence on a person is harmful and which is good. <br>  For example, a number of researchers who conducted experiments with this effect say that people who speak on a mobile phone have their ‚Äúaura‚Äù beginning to distort and very quickly take on a painful look.  And only 30 minutes after the conversation, she returns to normal.  Devices based on the ‚ÄúKirlian effect‚Äù clearly show the adverse effect of electromagnetic radiation on humans, even in the case when these emissions do not exceed the established sanitary standards.  True, I did not manage to find any official reports. <br><br>  Currently, the Kirlian effect is used to find hidden defects in metals, in agriculture, using the effect, it is possible to check seed germination, distinguish diseased plants from healthy ones, and Kirlian effect has been successfully used for express analysis of ore samples in geology. <br><br>  The classic says: Kirlian camera is necessary for research using the Kirlian method, a device that creates and fixes a Kirlian image.  So for its assembly, an adjustable high voltage source, a transparent electrode with a dielectric layer, a highly sensitive digital camera, a housing, etc., are needed. <br>  The essence of the method is that the object is placed between the capacitor plates, which are made of Plexiglas.  In the high-frequency field, the object between the plates acquires a special form of electrical conductivity, the so-called capacitive conductivity.  An electric charge appears in it, which does not move, as in metals, but, on the contrary, is held at the same points where it occurs, causing a glow of different brightness corresponding to the conductivity of the placed object.  The glow is visible visually. <br><br>  The electrode must have maximum transparency, sufficient strength, uniformity and low resistance of the conductive coating, to withstand high voltage.  For such purposes, homemade devices suggest using electrodes made of two glasses, between which salt water is poured, or a thin coating of indium and tin oxides (ITO) (resistive touch panels for mobile phones are well suited as the latter). <br>  The camera must be selected with maximum sensitivity (with a good CCD matrix) and the possibility of manual focusing within fairly wide limits. <br><br>  In the network, on thematic forums there are many schemes of this camera.  Craftsmen make it out of anything: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/644/6cc/ed0/6446cced021381b4d41fe8f27d83a90c.gif"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4dc/4bb/87c/4dc4bb87c046c388c05ec28ff14c92b5.gif"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ca4/f6d/ec1/ca4f6dec1833fdd41f767a4f8449f24e.gif"><br><br>  Even from piezo lighters: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c5f/b43/493/c5fb43493bc150719221c2d0217e877a.gif"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/539/27b/530/53927b530381a2503dc43714c63c88f1.gif"><br><br>  But what do we see?  Since the object to be photographed must be placed in the gap between the plates, and this is a gap of less than 0.5 mm, it can be concluded from this fact that the Kirlian method cannot be used to take photographs of a person.  At the same time, the market is filled with large swindlers who are trying to sell ‚Äúa unique product - MbGA aura-camera‚Äù, which allegedly reflects the psychological state and energy centers of a person (Today the cost of an instrument based on the ‚ÄúKirlian effect‚Äù is comparable to the cost of a domestic car) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2f7/75c/c94/2f775cc946f3c1e38bdbae3c983aeaae.gif"><br><br>  And by petty crooks who, for money, using the above equipment, take photos of the ‚Äúaura‚Äù of the people who applied, and as a result get the following result: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1f7/f06/da7/1f7f06da75b99d07729b0b901601f4df.gif"><br><br><br>  And for the manufacture of such photographs the most unpretentious equipment is used: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2f7/75c/c94/2f775cc946f3c1e38bdbae3c983aeaae.gif"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a1a/039/a3e/a1a039a3e7d0b73b9c3ccf366ca4d5e5.gif"><br><br>  That is some kind of box with electrodes, which has nothing to do with Kirlian‚Äôs camera, an ordinary webcam, and a laptop.  Oh yeah, I forgot the most important thing - "Special Software".  And the whole business.  Interestingly, and these electrodes at least soldered to something?  It turns out all the pictures of the "aura" around the human body that are published on the Internet are nothing more than speculations of programmers who are developing software for the gas-discharge visualization method? <br><br>  I rummaged through all Habr, and did not find a single topic about this effect, about this equipment, about my own user experiments.  Is it really not interesting to anyone? <br>  Share, maybe someone sorted out this black box with electrodes, maybe someone touched the software live?  What is inside? <br><br>  P.S.  Why are people being led to this divorce of crooks, do everyone really want to believe that it is so easy to monitor their condition? <br>  Pss  Or maybe I can do an application on an iOS application ‚Äî I put a finger on the screen, and it gives you an aura, and diseases, and a purpose in life.  Great! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/165417/">https://habr.com/ru/post/165417/</a></p>
