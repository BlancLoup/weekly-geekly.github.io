      Logically composed, but - based on incorrect premises. <br><br>  2) Plus, it is argued that the free flow of information is the essence of ‚Äúsocial development‚Äù, which is also true, but there are nuances. <br><br>  3) the conclusion follows - Akopov <s>should be killed about the wall</s> is wrong and his proposals should not be considered. <br><br>  In fact, it is not the free flow of information, but the free exchange of information that drives society. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In the field of open software, the idea that the free flow of information enriches the community is true and moving.  You wrote for free, he added it for free, I used it for free and reported for free that there was a bug somewhere, and we fixed it - it really moves. <br><br>  <i>But the original topic of Akopov is about films.</i>  <i>Let us return to them, and we will not mix the realities of the open-source development-and-use with other social aspects of the dissemination of information.</i> <br><br>  What is the exchange in the situation ‚ÄúI am watching your film‚Äù or ‚ÄúI am reading your book‚Äù or ‚ÄúI am not a programmer and not a tester, I just use your software‚Äù without paying for the viewing right? <br><br>  This is <b>consumption</b> , not exchange. <br><br>  Consumption without production as rights without obligations - the society is not developed. <br><br>  Why not call a spade a spade: copyright was, is, and will be present in all areas - industrial and / or public.  Its non-recognition does not contribute to the development of society. <br><br>  Society violates copyrights for the replication of digital products due to the fact that it is technologically simple.  And it will break as long as it is technologically possible.  If we were to be returned to the age of terrible typewriters "Yatran", and suggest kindly reproduce several books on Java ... And try in such conditions to find "fans of freebies" or "willing to violate copyright." <br><br>  <i>// I have a samizdat copy of The Master and Margarita from the mid-eighties.</i>  <i>It is very valuable in him that his sheets were among the first in a carbon-paper, therefore the text is distinguishable.</i>  <i>It‚Äôs hard to even imagine how long it took to reprint a copyright infringer that was unknown to me ...</i> <br><br>  It is strange that the undoubted violation of the law is recognized by the author of the topic as a boon to society. <br><br>  It is rather a blessing for individuals. <br><br>  1) If you ask these individuals how they relate to copyright on all sorts of films there, the answer will be, " <i>Ya-ya, you must freely reproduce!</i> " <br><br>  2) And if these individuals are given letters that ‚Äúyou have the right to distribute all kinds of films there,‚Äù and that this is the number of your bank account to which the money from the rental should be charged, then the answer to the question about the attitude to copyright will drastically change on " <i>Shoot all the pidarassen who sit in the torrents!</i> " <br><br>  A. Galich was already talking about such a metamorphosis in the 1960s ( <a href="http://geo.web.ru/bards/Galich/part51.htm">Ballad of surplus value</a> ).  There, our simple Soviet dude, suddenly found out that an unknown aunt Kaleria in the country of Fingalia had left a land and a factory in inheritance.  The dude started drinking with joy and sent all his bosses to hell. <br><br>  <i>But he came to a little by Monday,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Sat down to watch the transfer on TV.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>News announcer tells me</i> <i><br></i>  <i>About successes in the space field,</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>And then: We send a message from abroad.</i>  <i>The revolution in Fingalia!</i>  <i>The first decree of the people's government on the nationalization of lands, factories, factories and all other industrial enterprises.</i>  <i>The peoples of the Soviet Union greet and congratulate the brotherly people of Fingalia on their glorious victory!</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I look at the screen as gag,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>So how is it, everything national ?!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Well this is ours, I shout, with aunt Kaleu,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Well I gathered for this in Fingalia!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Scoundrels, screaming, loafers you!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>That's all, I scream, Marx's tricks!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Oh, there is no sadder story</i> <i><br></i>  <i>What about this surplus value!</i> <br><br>  3) Well, and if these individual people also participated in the production of these films there, spending money, you will most likely find fierce copywriters even among the ideological promoters of open-source ideas. <br><br>  <i>Somewhere on the bachet there was a replica of the designer: you put copyright marks everywhere, and make sure that no one else has your photos, and at the same time you cram Photoshop - how is this possible?</i>  <i>The designer did not answer.</i>  <i>For - yes, it is possible (albeit wrong).</i> <br><br>  It should be noted that: <br>  * freemen on the Internet ends as it develops, <br>  * punishments for offenses are always appointed personally, and not all at once, <br>  * illegal action - always a violation, without discounts on circumstances. <br><br>  Therefore, such a proposal: copyrights should be violated in a meaningful way, hiding and ashamed, knowing what you are doing, and taking responsibility for your decisions, rather than declaring that ‚Äúthis is good,‚Äù and even more so it is impossible to hide behind this matter in society. <br><br>  And then we really get to ‚ÄúAccess to the Internet by definition of the iris is allowed.  See the list of programs allowed for you to use on the left ... " <br><br>  Well, yes - to use Ubuntu does not mean calm and cleanliness.  Illegality is not only in the software.  Music, movies, books - everything falls under the question "Is this content authorized for use?" <br><br>  Threat For clarity: <br>  * I am not a copywriter. <br>  * I am not an anti-pyrast. <br>  * I paid money for some software, and this is normal.  But some software I have, mgm, alas ... <br>  * I fully work in Ubuntu (because it rules), and the licensed Windows works for me on the laptop (as a result of the acquisition). <br>  * On licensed discs, I only have super-movies that I specifically sought for the position in my video collection.  I do not record consumer goods on disks and do not aspire to store on HDD either. <br>  * music in my mp3.  Most - loot.  'mp3 is not a crime' :) A smaller part (super music) - removed from licensed discs in high quality.  Some of these drives are mine, in the closet. <br>  * Most of my CDs are audio books, which I poured in large numbers when I lived and worked in Kiev.  Not counterfeit. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96864/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96864/</a></p>
