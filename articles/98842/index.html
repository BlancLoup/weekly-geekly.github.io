  <section class="page js-page"><h1>OpenSource Electronic diaries system: a year later</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A year ago, Habr√© <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/edu_2_0/64223/">started the</a> way of my <a href="http://school-record-book.ru/">system</a> , designed to provide an easy start for informatization in schools.  For those who are too lazy to follow the link and read: written in Django, ascetic OpenSource system of electronic diaries for schools.  Since this publication much has changed. <br>  I tried to divide a bunch of pleasant and not so much happened during this time events into categories. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Technology </h4><br><br>  The most important change that occurred during this time is a change of license.  I gave up the GNU GPL v3 in favor of the New BSD License, which became the red flag for development.  That same evening, <a href="http://ikagroup.ru/">IKA GROUP</a> contacted me and offered integration with their ‚Äú <a href="http://e-sch.ru/">E-School</a> ‚Äù project.  Thanks to this cooperation, a nice interface and a bunch of new functions appeared in the system (all at the expense of ICA GROUPS).  Since then, if your school is working with my system, then at any time you can integrate it with turnstiles, an electronic library, a coffee shop, and many others, which will probably be developed in the near future. <br>  IKA GROUP has stimulated the creation of a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/recordbook/wiki/API">REST API</a> (JSON is used as a data transfer standard), which allowed free integration with other software and technical solutions.  Also, it became possible to print letters with grades for sending to parents, settings for third-party applications, the administrator had the opportunity to set marks, the student had the ‚ÄúPhoto‚Äù profile field, the opportunity to use the system in Ukraine (12-point system), the method of class presentation in the system created the basis for the implementation of billing, the possibility of SMS notifications and the development of a testing system. <br>  When communicating with parents, principals and school teachers, the question arose of SMS notifications with grades.  The problem has been solved only recently by the development of a special gateway.  The implementation scheme is as follows: <br><ul><li>  There is a special sms-gate, which is engaged in receiving messages from a copy of the System of electronic diaries and broadcasts to their parents.  By default, you can use my gateway, but you can change it to a third-party, as long as it conforms to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/recordbook/wiki/GateAPI">specification</a> .  (you must first register a copy of the system on the gate) </li><li>  The student's profile indicates the phone numbers of the parents, which are then transmitted to the gate. </li><li>  Parent pays for SMS in a way that is convenient for him (at the official gateway only payment via SMS is realized) </li><li>  Since then, the parent receives notifications about the adventures of his child by SMS. </li></ul><br>  Those who at the time of reading wish to offer me a super lucrative offer on SMS marketing, please do not worry.  The official gate sends and receives SMS through AvisoSMS, which is quite satisfied and I am not going to refuse. <br><br><h4>  Society </h4><br>  The project participated in the All-Russian Olympiad ‚Äú <a href="http://olimpsozvezdie.narod.ru/">Constellation</a> ‚Äù and took the third place in the ‚ÄúEducational Systems‚Äù nomination, giving first places to two electronic HTML textbooks, which seemed to the <i>competent</i> jury more difficult technically and more common among educational institutions, despite my examples of using the system and the absence of these from opponents.  Well, to hell with them. <br>  For the system and other merits, the kind state invited me to the ‚Äú <a href="http://fp2010.ru/">Winners Forum Breakthrough 2010</a> ‚Äù, the site of which is now working very strangely.  There, I signed an agreement with Rosmolodyezhu on information support for me, as the author of the system.  Half a year has passed since then, and all I received from this truly useful organization was two letters asking them to fill out questionnaires about the material situation of me and my family.

    <h4>  Where used </h4><br>  The system is partially used in the Bryansk City Lyceum No. 1 named after A.S. Pushkin, for which, in fact, everything was created.  Unfortunately, the inertia of the manual does not allow to implement the system completely. <br>  In the cadet naval corps named after Andrew the First Called, my system is used in conjunction with turnstiles.  I suggest everyone to admire the news reportage: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/dEObCM3A1JM&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhh8a_ooDcWydp9aLP0FvaTCWST_ag" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In all schools of the city of Krasnodon of the Luhansk region my electronic diaries system is being introduced, unfortunately, without any integration with anything.  Unfortunately, the project has no <a href="http://adminblog.krasnodon-online.ru/">website</a> , but there is a <a href="http://adminblog.krasnodon-online.ru/">blog for the</a> head of modernization. <br>  Also, the system is slowly and hardly implemented in the 62 schools of the city of Bryansk. <br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br>  Surprised how a trial project student can be so in demand.  Very shocked by the slowness and sluggishness can make decisions of school principals when they are offered, sorry for moveton, freebie. <br>  The system still does not have a logo and a decent site - alas, for a year, there was not a single designer altruist (yeah, a vulgar hint). <br>  Thanks for attention.  If you want to offer cooperation, I will be very happy. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98842/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98842/</a></p>
