Unambiguous interpretation of requirements, wishes <br>  and the will of the client. </h3><br>  <b>Worst case:</b> <br>  The client's wishes are transmitted by the PM to the encoder as is (vague, <br>  unintelligible) <br>  A requirement or task is formulated, for example, like this: ‚ÄúMake it <br>  more green, increase the font, move this block to the left, <br>  "Design this page in a general style." <br>  <b>Good practice:</b> <br>  PM, as far as possible, <br>  ascertains the requirements and wishes of the client and passes the specified <br>  coder requirements.  The requirement or task is formulated, for example, <br>  like this: "Use this # 0BB822 green color."  "Increase the font <br>  up to 18 pixels "," move the block 3 pixels to the left. " <br>  <b>Impact:</b> <br>  The more ambiguous and vague <br>  the requirement, the more time you need to spend on it <br>  performance.  Lack of clear criteria increases the difference <br>  in the vision of the end result of the customer and the manufacturer (remember <br>  a picture with swings and different visions of the result by different participants <br>  project) <br>  Do not flatter yourself with the imaginary autonomy given by the client in the decision. <br>  any questions because  autonomy logically suggests <br>  lack of strict acceptance (critical evaluation) by <br>  customer per se.  In practice, the client always asks to change <br>  or change some things again.  Should reduce the variability <br>  to a minimum <br>  <b>Actions:</b> <br>  <i>1. PM:</i> Clarify all ambiguities, articulate <br>  clear acceptance criteria.  Carefully treat the little things. <br>  Use the technique ‚ÄúDid I understand you correctly?‚Äù And others <br>  <i>2. HTML Encoder:</i> Inform PM about all issues and issues. <br>  ambiguity <br><h3>  2. Understanding what is happening and compound <br>  coding processes. </h3><br>  <b>Worst case:</b> <br>  PM does not understand the essence of the process <br>  layout, selects the wrong sequence of work coder <br>  in the project, cuts time, reduces the amount of work. <br>  PM does not see or understand the influence of design on functionality (when <br>  design makes change the work of the functionality). <br>  <b>Good practice:</b> <br>  PM clearly understands what <br>  the places of his project and at what stage he needs work <br>  with html.  Understands and considers possible risks, holds events <br>  to prevent them. <br>  PM notices places where design affects functionality.  If given <br>  location is critical - discussing changes with the project team;  if a <br>  No - discusses ‚Äúredrawing‚Äù with the client, taking into account the existing <br>  opportunities. <br>  <b>Impact:</b> <br>  Misunderstanding of what the result consists of, and how to achieve this result, <br>  leads to the existence of activities that are not included in the assessment.  This, as a result, <br>  leads to an overrun of project time. <br>  The source material for coding - a static picture showing <br>  special case of the site.  The result is a dynamic site.  Respectively, <br>  Acceptance is not in accordance with the ideal conditions shown in the picture, <br>  and on the current (actual) situation. <br>  <i>Example:</i> At the entrance there is a PSD (or several PSD) <br>  for your own CMS.  At the first assessment, it seems that adaptation <br>  design can consist only of the task "cutting and stretching on the CMS". <br>  However, CMS is not just the main page.  This and the results page <br>  search, archive page of news and articles, etc.  Unaccounted pages <br>  have their own features and elements that are not displayed on the PSD and need <br>  at least in the minimal ghost to the overall style.  So need <br>  new task - adaptation of the design of existing blocks to the new <br>  design.  This task can not be done immediately.  It stretches, <br>  since, including the new functionality, the client appears <br>  New questions and wishes for the design of new pages (customer, buying <br>  CMS may suddenly want to include functionality that is <br>  in CMS, but was not intended at the beginning).  Creation of a situation of trawling <br>  and overrun project time.  Because  time has been estimated for <br>  visible pages at the beginning of the project (and this, for example, one main <br>  page), but by commitment we have to adapt the CMS for <br>  customer, and his new requirements are invested in this commitment. <br>  <b>Actions:</b> <br>  <i>1. Workflow:</i> PM, providing HTML design <br>  coder for review, gets an expert opinion on possible problem <br>  places, places of influence of design on functionality, issues that <br>  should be clarified with the client. <br>  <i>2. Workflow:</i> Hold ‚Äúopen days‚Äù, <br>  when colleagues explain to each other the specifics and characteristics of their <br>  work, discuss the difficulties and measures to eliminate them. <br>  <i>3. Workflow</i> Outline Problem Solving <br>  or the problems themselves in the local wiki (either as documents, descriptions, <br>  FAQ) thus creating a knowledge base. <br>  <i>4. PM:</i> Notify HTML coder about upcoming jobs. <br>  Discuss possible existing bottlenecks, find out the probability <br>  some unplanned activity, discuss risks and activities <br>  to reduce their effects. <br>  <i>5. HTML coder:</i> Evaluate your project activity, <br>  specifying all activities to perform the task.  Exhibit <br>  performance percentages of tasks in existing project tracking <br>  systems.  Notify risk exposure, consult in arising <br>  issues. <br><br><h3>  3. Understanding the terms and conditions of the platform used or <br>  of the project </h3><br>  <b>Worst case:</b> <br>  PM agrees with the requirements <br>  customer relying on ease of implementation or existence <br>  similar functionality in the system. <br>  RM has only basic knowledge of the system. <br>  <b>Good practice:</b> <br>  Perfect when PM <br>  well knows the system in which he works (has a versatile <br>  experience with the system) and in discussion with the client relies on <br>  your experience. <br>  A more realistic option when PM calls a consultant <br>  project (or an experienced developer) to assess the labor costs <br>  on creation (change) of a functional or discussed works. <br>  <b>Impact:</b> <br>  Knowledge of system limitations <br>  will allow even at the stage of setting the task by the client <br>  and labor costs of implementation, to prevent situations where it is necessary <br>  answer for obligations, and the solution of the problem requires large <br>  unplanned time and resources, unstable solutions <br>  ("Crutches"), etc. <br>  <b>Actions:</b> <br>  <i>1. Workflow:</i> Use consultant in project <br>  with the consultancy task (in addition to this task, he may <br>  do not participate). <br>  <i>2. PM:</i> Before starting a project, examine the system, consult <br>  with colleagues (or consultant) and explore previous work experience <br>  my colleagues. <br>  <i>3. Workflow:</i> Outline Problem Solving <br>  or the problems themselves in the wiki (documents, descriptions, FAQ). <br>  <i>4. Workflow:</i> Conducting general events <br>  to increase the level of competence of the systems used (knowledge <br>  system and its limitations is necessary and the encoder.  See point 7. Works <br>  HTML coder). <br><br><h3>  4. Objectivity. </h3><br>  <b>Worst case:</b> <br>  PM can not arrange <br>  project priorities in critical situations, treats the current <br>  The situation in the project is far from the true state of affairs.  Picks <br>  quick and often adventurous decisions. <br>  <b>Good practice:</b> <br>  PM has and offers <br>  sequence of work for the emergency version of the project, <br>  checks and rearranges work on the situation, tries to use <br>  stable solutions, sees the entire project as a whole, consults <br>  with the project team before making a decision (even if it‚Äôs known <br>  that the opinion of the project team will be different). <br>  <b>Impact:</b> <br>  No comments <br><h3>  5. Control of the project and individual parts <br>  at different stages. </h3><br>  <b>Worst case:</b> <br>  PM checks the project at the end. <br>  <b>Good practice:</b> <br>  PM verifies results by <br>  the progress of the project at each stage (by milestones) or upon completion <br>  task, etc.), carries out operational control. <br>  <b>Impact:</b> <br>  Not controlling the project on each <br>  stage, PM increases the likelihood of cost overruns <br>  and the failure of deadlines.  The situation is worsened by the fact that, in the case <br>  control at the end responsible for the current situation in <br>  the project, according to PM‚Äôs vision, is only an HTML coder (if task <br>  ‚ÄúStretch‚Äù last in the project).  And the fact that you still need <br>  again attract resources for development, testing and, possibly, <br>  re-tightening. <br>  <i>Example:</i> There is a project in which the design <br>  at its beginning there is no.  Development went without a prototype and without design, <br>  functional specification only.  The client has sent rolled <br>  design or PSD, and after that the HTML coder enters the project.  Situation: <br>  in the design part of the functional is drawn, which differs from <br>  the one that is made.  Moreover, the implementation of the difference can still pull <br>  20% -60% of the time already spent on development.  Consequently <br>  - simple HTML coder and deadline for delivery. <br>  <b>Actions:</b> <br>  <i>1. PM:</i> To exercise control at all stages (and <br>  in between) the project.

    <h3>  6. Effective communication. </h3><br>  <b>Worst case:</b> <br>  PM discusses common to the project <br>  moments with each project participant separately.  Project participants <br>  communicate and solve operational issues, too, "everyone with everyone." <br>  IM project discussion takes a lot (or even more) <br>  time than doing the task.  There is a need to discuss <br>  working moments with several people at the same time (except for <br>  also the same). <br>  <b>Good practice:</b> <br>  All project participants are in the know <br>  Changes and discussion of common for the project details. <br>  <b>Impact:</b> <br>  ‚ÄúEvery-one‚Äù communication is always <br>  leads to the fact that missing some details on the project, important <br>  for all participants (details, changes, sequence <br>  performing tasks, etc.). <br>  <b>Actions:</b> <br>  <i>1. Workflow:</i> Outline Results <br>  communication, report on the results of all project participants.  Whenever possible <br>  discuss common details at the maximum of project participants. <br>  <i>2. Worker</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Process:</i> Assign strict dates and times for project meetings with mandatory <br>  the presence of the whole team.  Summing up (cut). <br><br><h2>  The working process </h2><br><h3>  1. The presence of one reporting body, one chain, one director <br>  tasks. </h3><br>  <b>Worst case:</b> <br>  The need to report to several people, get jobs from several places. <br>  <b>Good practice:</b> <br>  The ability to respond to one <br>  by a certain person (most often by the PM of the project) PM is responsible and makes all the key decisions, <br>  sets tasks, etc. <br>  <b>Impact:</b> <br>  When to report to <br>  by several people, it looks like this: tell <br>  first, discuss, answer questions.  Tell the second, discuss, <br>  answer the questions.  Tell the first that you decided with the second, <br>  discuss, answer questions.  Tell the second comment <br>  and what was decided with the first one (God forbid that the second has no comments <br>  or suggestions).  Thus, the solution to the problem does not begin. <br>  before discussing it.  Despite the apparent illogic of such actions, <br>  they happen.  The particular drama is that they happen just <br>  at the most inopportune moment - when the project is overspending <br>  time (since except PM'a in the control of the project includes new <br>  people are higher leaders.  And each of them must <br>  get up to date and make new decisions). <br>  Having shifted the first Parkinson's law for this situation: the more <br>  people deal with the same problem, the more chaos. <br>  <b>Actions:</b> <br>  <i>1. Workflow:</i> Make decisions by chain. <br>  Make as much effort as possible so as not to tear off the final <br>  artist from work on the task.  Discussions hold a group. <br><br><h3>  2. Availability and compliance with standards and requirements. </h3><br>  <b>Worst case:</b> <br>  Lack of standards or <br>  their non-compliance. <br>  <b>Good practice:</b> <br>  Availability and compliance with standards. <br>  <b>Impact:</b> <br>  Non-compliance and lack of standards <br>  causes the same errors to be repeated from project to project <br>  (inconsistencies, irrationality, time overruns, etc.).  Availability <br>  standards not only avoids mistakes, but also increases <br>  quality of the final product.  The use of standards should be <br>  brought to such a level that it becomes an automatic process <br>  and did not make you think or remember "how is it according to the standard", <br>  and allowed to focus on solving the problem. <br>  <i>Example:</i> A very simple example of how it seemed <br>  would a minor thing affect the logic or time of the project.  AT <br>  one of the standards is to mark * (asterisk) fields, mandatory <br>  to the fill to the left of the field name.  Failure and absence <br>  control over the execution led to the fact that on different forms <br>  The project part of the stars was to the left, the part to the right.  Because  leave <br>  this is not logical, then time was spent on bringing all such <br>  places to standard. <br>  <b>Actions:</b> <br>  <i>1. Workflow:</i> Introduce and ratify standards. <br>  Some time to monitor their compliance. <br><br><h3>  3. Presence and cultivation of knowledge base, past experience, etc. </h3><br>  <b>Worst case:</b> <br>  Experience is not outlined anywhere, the knowledge base is missing. <br>  <b>Good practice:</b> <br>  Information - an intangible asset of the company that you want to protect and preserve. <br>  It often happens that one person knows what others do not know.  In such <br>  the absence of this person in the project - the risk of the project. The existence of a base <br>  Knowledge - a way to improve skills and experience. <br>  <i>Example</i> : Electronic Library, Local Wiki <br>  - good examples of knowledge base organization (subject to periodic <br>  replenishment useful articles). <br>  <b>Actions:</b> <br>  <i>1. Workflow:</i> After the project take notes <br>  potential for repetition in other projects places (description <br>  "Problem - solution", instructions for the implementation of some actions). <br>  <i>2. Workflow:</i> Bring to each employee <br>  Information about the existence of a knowledge base and promotion (promotion) <br>  its development. <br>  <i>3. Workflow:</i> Create a centralized electronic <br>  storage with books in electronic form (folder on the server).  Create <br>  a special section in the local wiki with reviews, reviews and recommendations <br>  on existing books. <br>  <b>Finally, I would like to wish you more interesting projects, new experience and good practice.</b> <br><br>  Like this article?
