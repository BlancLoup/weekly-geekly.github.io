  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Apple is creating an iPhone-like Netbook!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Appearing several fresh news, indirectly confirm the assumptions put forward in the September article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/apple/40069/"><strong>"Steve Jobs is trying to invent Dynabook again!"</strong></a> <br>  1) <a href="http://www.deepapple.com/news/32304.html"><strong>‚ÄúResults Q4'08 under the microscope.</strong></a>  <a href="http://www.deepapple.com/news/32304.html"><strong>Details, details, nuances "</strong></a> : <br>  ‚ÄúThe new-fashioned netbooks got the Jobs performance of the‚Äú nascent device class ‚Äù, which Apple CEO immediately contrasted to the iPhone with similar functionality and reduced form factor.  However, in fact, in the asset of Cupertino, there are already a number of some "netbook" developments that will work as the demand for such devices grows.  Answers to questions about potential Apple tablets were categorically denied ... " <br>  2) <a href="http://www.deepapple.com/news/32324.html"><strong>‚ÄúRead my lips: Apple de la e no-book‚Äù</strong></a> : <br>  "- Jobs also said that the company has prepared a" number of extremely interesting developments, "which will go into action when the netbook market begins to expand rapidly. <br>  This is quite consistent with the information that I was provided by an anonymity company specialized in search engines: at this point in time, there are visits to Web sites from an unknown Apple device, the screen resolution of which is stuck halfway between the iPhone and MacBook ... " <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  3) <a href="http://www.cybersecurity.ru/hard/57630.html"><strong>"On the market there will appear netbooks based on ARM processors"</strong></a> : <br>  ‚ÄúA British developer of mobile processors, ARM today distributed information about the imminent appearance of netbooks based on ARM Cortex A8 and A9 processors.  Initially, these processors, which have ultra-low power consumption, were designed as solutions for smartphones and new cell phones. <br>  ‚ÄúIn the future we intend to enter the netbook market.  Relevant announcements should be expected over the next few months, "said Rob Coombs, director of mobile solutions for ARM ..." <br>  4) <a href="http://itua.info/news/communications/17369.html"><strong>‚ÄúGood Internet only with Intel?‚Äù</strong></a> : <br>  ‚ÄúIn the iPhone, as Intel‚Äôs vice president of mobile business, Shane Wall, said, there are problems when running a number of Internet applications. <br>  Although in reality, the flaws of the iPhone need to be blamed not for Apple, but for the manufacturer of its processor - ARM, a British company, as not only Apple, but also other manufacturers of mobile communication devices have problems with the fact that their smartphones built on architecture ARM, have insufficient performance, as noted by Pankaj Kedia, Intel's director of ultra-mobile ecosystems ... " <br>  5) <a href="http://www.deepapple.com/news/32334.html"><strong>"Intel apologized for criticizing the ARM processor"</strong></a> : <br>  ‚ÄúIntel today had to apologize for the excessive frankness of its top managers, who called the slow ARM processor the main misfortune of the iPhone communicator ...‚Äù <br><br>  <b>PS:</b> <br>  Apple iPhone display 480 x 320-pixel resolution <br>  Apple MacBook display 1280 x 800 (native) <br>  Average between them ~ 800 x 600 display resolution <br><br>  The Sony eReader PRS-505 / LC readers and the new Sony PRS-700 Reader Digital Book have exactly the same resolution.  And they say that they are in great demand in the USA, so this product is now in short supply there.  And actually reading books in electronic form is convenient, but the old Sony PRS-505 had a huge disadvantage, because it does not allow searching for the right words in books, but only allows you to read books while turning the pages.  The search function is a very necessary thing and perhaps in the new Sony PRS-700 model it will be implemented, because  it appeared Touch-interface and the ability to control the reader poking at her finger. <br>  But still, the <b>Sony PRS-700 is</b> as <b>good</b> as it <b>gets</b> : <br>  - E-ink display can work for a week, or even more; <br>  and a bunch of <b>flaws</b> : <br>  - no search; <br>  - there is no possibility to launch a third-party program, for example, a Bible search created as a Java applet; <br>  - there is no possibility to watch Video; <br>  - no connection and the ability to work in InterNet; <br>  - Well, finally a black / white screen. <br>  Therefore, it seems that the market is ready to meet Apple's iPhone-like device with a screen resolution of 800 x 600, which can compete with both Sony readers and Asus Netbooks :) </div>
