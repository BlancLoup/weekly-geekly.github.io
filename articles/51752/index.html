  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Thoughts after the seminar ‚ÄúWe need to act!‚Äù NET, Start-up, crisis and opportunities that Anton Nosik spent</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I always wanted to see Anton Nosik live.  It‚Äôs one thing when reading different rumors, articles and notes about a person, it‚Äôs quite another to see how he behaves, how and what he says. <br>  I will share my thoughts on what I heard and my vision of how the seminar was held. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h6>  Intro </h6><br>  Anton immediately makes a good impression, he is an interesting interlocutor, but, unfortunately, Anton Borisovich often leaves aside, talking about minor things.  Fortunately, as easily Anton returns to the main line, without losing the essence of the monologue. <br><br><h6>  Israeli Munchausen </h6><br>  I can not say that I learned something fundamentally new.  Anton Nosik talked about obvious things that everyone who sees beyond his nose notice (did the <i>pun come out, or did I try hard?)</i> . <br>  Anton talked about the scam of Israeli banks that bought their own shares for the clients' money, thereby artificially raising the value of their own financial papers.  Immediately I recall the feat of Baron Munchhausen, who managed to pull himself along with the horse out of the swamp, using only the musculature of his hands and his own hair on his head.  The Baron did it all, but the Israeli banks somehow didn‚Äôt.

    <h6>  Little graphomania </h6><br>  Anton talked about how the forces of the USSR sabotage groups created hotbeds of tension in the Middle East, which led to local wars, disruptions in oil supplies and, accordingly, an increase in the prices of black gold and the demand for weapons.  I am not a historian, and history is not a simple science, due to the fact that historical ‚Äúfacts‚Äù are difficult to verify.  I do not think that the main objectives of the USSR were the tasks of maintaining high prices and oil and the demand for weapons.  Such tasks were, but they were secondary <i>(this is my opinion)</i> .  If we turn our attention to the attitude of the United States and the USSR to Israel, it can be noted that the attitude has often changed, and from sharply negative to quite benevolent and vice versa.  The United States pursued and continues to pursue the main goal - the massive creation of areas of controlled chaos.  Metasystem - humanity is not centralized, the destruction of one of the nodes will not lead to the destruction of the system.  If you remember, the 9/11 attack, initially perceived as the beginning of the end of America, was overpriced a couple of days later, and everyone understood that the two towers that fell would not affect the economic power of the states.  One military confrontation between the Palestinians and Israel will not lead to a crisis in the East, so the wars in Afghanistan and then in Iraq were continued.  From the middle of the 20th century, the United States was engaged in creating areas of controlled chaos throughout the earth, and the USSR responded symmetrically.  How it ended, we know.  I strongly disagree with the fact that the USSR was engaged exclusively in raising oil prices. <br><br><h6>  The Munchausen case lives and wins (author's note) </h6><br>  With the economy, the states turned out much better.  Concentrating in its hands the main cash flows, America crap one's pants.  Together with her all the others crap one's pants.  The problem is that the states will calmly come out of the crisis, but all the others will not.  The operation to centralize one of the subsystems of humanity - the economy was successful.  The destruction of the basis of the economy - banks and KO shatov, led to the fact that almost all countries that took part in global economic relations got into a deep pool.  And the landing script was written long ago.  See how easy it is to manage a system with a single center?  States just as easily want to manage humanity, as a metasystem in which we still live. <br>  If you pay attention, the story of Anton about the Israeli banks, trying to repeat the feat of Baron Munchausen repeated.  America handed out money to the right and left, borrowers took money and invested it ... in American securities (our dumb-headed economists, son-daughters of ministers did just that with our money).  Thanks to Anton, I realized that after his story. <br><br><h6>  Birthday every 18 months </h6><br>  Gates was mentioned, in particular, his words about the Internet, and about how these same words were taken back two years later - Gates, who had seen the death of the Internet, a gathering of bespectacled freaks, by the 96th year claimed that the Internet was the future.  The example with Gates emphasizes the thought of Anton - that business that survives is able to adapt to the realities, not to insulate itself from the surrounding reality.  Gates "rebuilt" the company again every 18 months, this is one of the main reasons why MS still lives and smells.  ‚ÄúSo that the eggs do not stagnate,‚Äù Anton said somehow.  :) Funny.  But true.  It's bad when eggs stagnate, even in business. <br>  According to Anton, during a crisis, it is necessary to cut not everyone, but non-production bones - any corporate souvenir, vehicle fleet and other <s>stuff</s> .  It's hard not to agree. <br>  Anton said that the crisis is a wonderful time for dropping husks and merging fools.  He gave examples of how in the ‚Äúera of grace‚Äù strange people came into projects and demolished them.  He told about e-start, which was supposed to be the first electronic gloss.  In the birth of a startup, many well-known and talented runetts took part, a little bit about the e-start can be found here: the <a href="http://www.artlebedev.ru/news/2000/algrelease_68.html">page on the CAL</a> .  The project was destroyed by a friend who is not a friend to us at all - Mr. Mac Kinsey. <br>  Fools were all rating agencies, auditors (which, for example, did not save Yukos). <br>  Anton believes that robbery by you know who should be less.  And I do not believe.  And you? <br>  He told an interesting story about Rosno, where his office burned down, and then it turned out that Rosno herself is the 9000th reinsurer of the building.  And from two twin towers one was insured.  He urged not to save where you can burn, carefully assess the risks and insure as much as possible against them.  You will lose more then.  On the other hand, if you go for it, your sandwich will not fall as butter down, and your sleep will be strong and deep. <br>  Auto.ru and ixbt.ru were marked, it is to the conversation that portals, blogs, social.  Networks existed 100 years ago, lived and developed remarkably.  There was a boom of blogs and blogospheres, everyone started talking about blogs, before that there was a boom of portals, then - networks.  As you can see, the most useful ones remained, all stupid projects were taken and ‚Äúscreamed‚Äù <i>(formed from ‚ÄúKarachun‚Äù, the term of A. B. Nosik)</i> . <br>  Engage in social networks, vseravno that run for the train, which left three years ago.  I think so too. <br><br><h5>  Summary </h5><br>  Summing up, I will note the main thoughts. <br>  1. A crisis, this is for wimps, for those who have long been looking for a reason to leave the business or to remain without work, but could not find a reason. <br>  2. A crisis is an impetus to development, when there are more offers from skilled workers, and all silly competitors are bent because they are morons.  Survive the strongest. <br>  3. A crisis, not a crisis - what's the difference?  Do not create idols and think with your head. <br>  4. In business there is a place for everyone, even in the social.  networks.  Following point number three, think about what you will do and who will need you with your SS.  Until you understand, nothing happens. <br>  5. Do not look for those responsible for the crisis, you will quickly find them.  Look for a way out of the crisis - this task is more difficult. <br><br><h6>  From the author </h6><br>  Frankly, I expected more.  My story well reflects what was at the seminar - a lot of talk around the bush, much less about reality, reality.  In addition to the pleasant impressions from the story of Anton <i>(it is interesting to listen)</i> , I still have a small summary of 5 pages, a couple of fresh ideas and not the darkest thoughts.  The seminar was more like the story of a man who manages to do business, despite the critical situation in the country.  We listened to the attitude of Anton to the crisis, about the various comical tricks of contemporary Russian business, about how Anton created interesting projects. <br>  Anton tried to do a SWOT analysis, but I did not write a word about it.  Sorry, my language doesn‚Äôt turn to call common sense an abbreviation of four letters.  But I can encode this abbreviation with a special three-letter word. <br>  Anton said the right words.  More I can not give any assessment and form your opinion.  Whether Anton follows the rules about which he told us, only his colleagues and business partners can tell. <br><br>  In general, guys, the recipe "how to make a startup and sell for 9000 billion dollars" does not exist.  Damn, I didn‚Äôt surprise anyone.  We continue to think with our head and work! <br><h6>  Used Books </h6><br>  Anton talked about such books: <br>  Pharonomics, The Death of an Empire by Gaidar, Gates's Road to the Future. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51752/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51752/</a></p>
