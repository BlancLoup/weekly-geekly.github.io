  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Faraday Future - Tesla's mysterious competitor from the Middle Kingdom - may be the brainchild of LeTV</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/98b/acf/e12/98bacfe1287246f897fc0f0e50e829c7.jpg"><br><br>  Recently rumors about who is behind the mysterious company for the production of electric Faraday Future.  And while some believe that this is the work of Apple giant Apple, it‚Äôs more likely that Faraday Future belongs to the Chinese company Leshi Internet Information &amp; Technology, also known as LeTV, which is also called ‚ÄúChinese Netfix‚Äù.  In order to think so, there are many reasons ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, Chinese billionaire Jia Yuetin, president of LeTV, at the end of last year said that his company has been developing an electric vehicle for a year, and that he intends to acquire a license for the production of electric vehicles that could surpass the acclaimed Tesla Ilona Maska . <br><br>  In 2014, Jia Yuetin described his plans for the construction of electric vehicles as follows: ‚ÄúThis is our dream and passion.  Look at the skies of China, all responsible citizens want to correct the current environmental situation.  It's true". 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      According to various sources, this spring, Jia Yuetin invested his own $ 1.2 billion in LeTV, then withdrew this money, apparently hoping to support a new project related to the creation of electric vehicles. <br><br>  It can be hoped that the Beijing company is developing a ‚Äúrelatively affordable‚Äù internet-connected smart car.  Recently, LeTV has hired first-class automotive engineers, luring them away from Tesla itself, as well as from other American companies.  It is not excluded that the Chinese giant plans to build electric cars not only for the domestic, but also the American market, giving battle to the enemy on its own territory. <br><br>  In the table below we see that last year in Garden, California, office premises were purchased by LeTV ENV. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a4b/8b3/f72/a4b8b3f721834835884dfd04be9ec1f5.jpg"><br><br>  Further research suggests that Chinese film producer Chaoing Deng will take over as CEO.  According to LinkedIn, Chaoin Dan holds the position of director of the Chinese company Le Vision Pictures, which in turn is a branch of LeTV. <br><br>  Zapple New Energy Vehicle Company is perhaps another name for the future Faraday Future, since LeTV ENV (or Energy New Vehicle) is listed as the buyer of the premises of offices in Gardena for Faraday headquarters, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich was 11,520 square meters in Gardena. <br><br>  In accordance with the statements of "knowledgeable" people, the founders of Faraday Future are going to position the company as a competitor to Tesla, based in the United States.  The fact that ‚Äúthe Chinese do not want to buy Chinese products‚Äù makes them take this step. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296208/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296208/</a></p>
