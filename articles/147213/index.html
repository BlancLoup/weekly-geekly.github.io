No, new multimedia laptops cannot be considered ‚Äúultrabooks,‚Äù but the changes have become truly radical.  In addition to the expected changes in the hardware, ASUS decided to redesign.  Common features with previous models of the series can be traced, however, we are faced with modern devices that can please not only the appearance, but also a number of surprises. <br><br>  Update received several models (N46VZ / VM, N56VZ / VM, N76VZ / VM).  The differences are not only in the size of the display.

      On the differences and similarities we will talk on the example of the laptop ASUS N46. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Specifications:</b> <br><br>  <b>Processor:</b> Core i5-3210M / Core i7-3610QM. <br><br>  <b>RAM:</b> 4 GB (with expansion up to 8 GB). <br><br>  <b>Display:</b> 14.0 "16: 9 HD (1366x768) / matte. <br><br>  <b>Discrete graphics:</b> NVIDIA GeForce GT 630M (2 GB DDR3). <br><br>  <b>Storage:</b> <br>  1 TB 5400 rpm; <br>  750 GB 5400 rpm / 7200 rpm; <br>  500 GB 5400 rpm / 7200 rpm <br><br>  <b>Ports and communications:</b> two audio ports (microphone / headphones), VGA / D-Sub, three USB 3.0, RJ45, HDMI, card reader.  Bluetooth 4.0, wi-fi 802.11 b / g / n. <br><br>  <b>Dimensions:</b> <br>  34.5 x 24.1 x 2.7 ~ 3.2 cm. (On Core i3 / i5 processors); <br>  34.5 x 24.5 x 2.7 ~ 3.4 cm. (On the Core i7 processor). <br><br>  <b>Weight:</b> 2.4 kg.  (with battery) <br><br>  <b>Appearance</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/470/e7c/ad2/470e7cad21b1ba5f395e5b4e57c9c6a4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>ASUS N55SF with a glossy plastic coating.</i> <br><br>  Perhaps you remember one of our previous reviews, or you yourself own the predecessor of the N- "sixth".  In this case, to understand why the changes in design are called radical will not be difficult. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e3a/6bc/d65/e3a6bcd6555629d3fedfc6cccf2176e4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Dark black tones with oily luster of glossy plastic have completely sunk into oblivion, giving way to light aluminum design.  There are no sharp edges of ZENBOOK and reflective surfaces.  The corners are emphasized streamlined, and the decorative and acoustic grille on the keyboard adds airiness.  It seems to me that this style is more suitable for a living room than for an office, but this is already a matter of taste. <br><br>  To say that ASUS N46 is completely made of aluminum, unfortunately, it is impossible: the bottom cover is plastic, the top one, on which the ASUS logo is placed, is trimmed with metal only to the edge, where the plastic bar is laid, under which the antennas of the wireless modules are located.  The ASUS logo is also made of plastic, but transparent, which provides illumination from the side of the display LEDs.  Display edging - opaque plastic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7a8/f12/610/7a8f126107250e526ab08d00c677a262.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If we talk about design, then the claim is only to the bottom cover - it has a noticeable compartment for the hard disk.  Removable bottom panel provides quick access to memory / hard disk. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/481/2d6/d36/4812d6d36bd4db70ecbc3ab088fc8d01.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The working panel is trimmed with aluminum, it is just nice to hold hands on it.  In addition, it is not brand, fingerprints do not remain. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ee4/fdf/37c/ee4fdf37c5cdfe8deb6482c819ddc397.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The top of the working panel is decorated with a special feature - concentric circles from black dots.  At first it may seem that this is an unusual solution for acoustics, but this is not so: most of the surface of the lattice is decorative.  Such designer refinement may not be entirely practical, given the omnipresent dust, but it certainly looks modern and attracts attention. <br><br>  <b>Interfaces</b> <br><br>  There are no connectors on the back of the notebook.  On the front side there is a multi-format card reader, five indicators of activity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c7a/d15/677/c7ad1567790bc39db47f9a9f3aaad5db.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7a5/29a/e63/7a529ae6356b59db8cddc534f0982af6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the right side there are two audio ports, a USB 3.0 port, an optical drive, a subwoofer output (it comes in the box), a Kensington lock.  On the left - two ports USB 3.0, HDMI, RJ45 (under the latch), radiator cooling system, D-sub and charging jack. <br><br>  <b>Work panel</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/30d/c4b/7c4/30dc4b7c47cc010be12c9f9bd96911ee.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The keyboard layout is typical for 14-inch models, there is no digital block.  The main innovation - adjustable backlight.  Do rubber keys a good move.  Due to the hard metal base, the keyboard is not pressed through. <br><br>  In the upper left corner of the working panel there is a soft-key to which you can assign the execution of one of the fixed actions or the launch of any application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1f5/74d/fb2/1f574dfb23b81c9595b13f5377ab245f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The touchpad of ASUS N46 is wide, with a concentric pattern, decorated in the same way as the entire panel.  It is convenient to use it, however the corners of the touch panel, which act as keys, are pressed with force.  Probably, ordinary users will not pay attention to this, but after the active use of the ASUS G74 touchpad (soft and sensitive, like a hamster skin), it was unusual for me. <br><br>  <b>Screen</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a41/1f2/fae/a411f2fae0ea1f191f7e2df608ea0299.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>In room.</i>  <i>The colors of the display may seem cool, but this is easily corrected by software.</i> <br><br>  You won‚Äôt surprise anyone with a matte display - it‚Äôs there, and it‚Äôs nice.  But with the screen resolution the situation is ambiguous.  On the one hand, the resolution of 1366x768 is fairly standard for a 14-inch matrix, and ... it seems not so much.  But if this is an important, fundamental point for you, you can make a choice in the direction of the N56 / N76, in which FullHD 1920x1080. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4e5/298/016/4e5298016f3dd05c17bb1eb183e56442.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>In the sunlight against the backdrop of his majesty carpet.</i> <br><br>  Horizontal and vertical viewing angles - 150 and 120 degrees.  Yes, this is a TN matrix, from which you should not expect fantastic results, but the display is bright, with good contrast and good color reproduction. <br><br>  <b>Performance</b> <br><br><img src="http://img268.imageshack.us/img268/4240/56651047.png" alt="image"><br>  Rejoice, lovers of synthetic tests: ASUS N46 is based on Intel Ivy Bridge processors.  In the reviewed model, the Core i5-3210M is installed, and the models with the Core i7 3610QM 2300 Mhz are now on sale. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/060/fa3/e52/060fa3e52308b470c25397825b238a37.png" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/493/c93/538/493c9353880344dc454fcbe2ec9aef79.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The laptop's graphics subsystem is built on the Nvidia Optimus hybrid solution, which allows you to switch between the integrated Intel Graphics HD 4000 core and the discrete one from Nvidia.  In this case, the standard model N46VM (as in the review) is equipped with graphics GeForce GT630M ‚ÄúFermi‚Äù, and the more advanced N46VZ ‚Äî GeForce GT650M ‚ÄúKepler‚Äù.  The latter is a development of the Fermi architecture, with the main difference being that the technical process was reduced from 40 to 28 nm (with all the necessary advantages). <br><br>  Cards have good performance.  Modern games are at medium and high settings.  You can learn more about the gaming capabilities of the cards <a href="http://www.notebook-center.ru/video_353.html">here</a> (GT630M) and <a href="http://www.notebook-center.ru/video_372.html">here</a> (GT650M). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/69b/e2c/8e2/69be2c8e22a11673112148329f21f35b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The amount of RAM in engineering samla is 6 GB, although you will rather find versions for 4 or 8 GB on the official sale. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/123/5da/584/1235da5842bdbaa74d37feb9a7d2f6ac.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The classic hard drive SEAGATE Momentus ST9750423AS 750 GB, SATA II, buffer memory 16 MB is used to store information.  The model has a spindle speed of 5400 rev / min. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5dd/ef4/225/5ddef422575472c8db1659801505d801.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The data transfer rate is not very high, but the disk is not noisy and is great for storing music, movies and games. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c0f/353/ba6/c0f353ba64606c2d1a11cba5100616b7.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Windows performance rating: the minimum value of 5.8 is typed by the integrated Intel graphics card.</i> <br><br>  <b>Sound</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/41a/83a/2df/41a83a2df35fecebfc004bd08db6cda0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Actually, why do we need tracks and videos.  The sound quality of ASUS laptops has long been satisfactory.  Much credit goes to Bang &amp; Olufsen, with which the very first N-laptops were created.  The ASUS N46 has excellent 2.1 acoustics.  Perhaps the external subwoofer can already be considered the standard de facto for multimedia laptops.  2-3 hours, which the notebook will last offline when playing video, is enough to experience all the advantages of a real cinema. <br><br>  But this does not mean that there is no place to strive further.  Acoustics in a laptop is still the most difficult to update element of the system.  But we have already reached the stage when you can stop bashfully connecting headphones / external speakers whenever we want to listen to music or watch a movie. <br><br>  <b>Battery life</b> <br><br>  In economy mode (reading mode), the laptop worked more than 5 hours.  In this case, only Intel integrated graphics were involved.  The video playback mode is 2 hours 30 minutes. <br><br>  <b>Heat dissipation and noise</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d05/414/a0c/d05414a0c30765272a8840044854b13d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The dimensions of the laptop allowed to thoughtfully place the cooling system.  Externally, the device heats up slightly, despite the powerful hardware stuffing, while the working surface remains comfortable for hands.  You can feel the heating only from the side of the blowing grille, the bottom plastic cover is slightly heated.  At the same time, even with a high load, the laptop is not annoying with noise. <br><br>  <b>findings</b> <br><br>  ASUS N46 has a practical, modern body, in which attention is focused on the aluminum finish.  The design is dominated by smooth lines, light colors, and the decorative grille adds visual appeal. <br><br>  However, the device clearly lacks a certain elegance: a thickness of 3.2 cm and a weight of 2.4 kg.  Nevertheless, the body is characterized by high rigidity, the keyboard does not bend, and a fall from a small height does not seem to cause serious damage. <br><br>  Matt surface finish this time is not an exception, but the rule.  The matte display provides the necessary level of comfort in high light conditions, and the keyboard backlight helps out in total darkness. <br><br>  ASUS N46, like the N56 / N76, is a long-awaited update of the popular line of multimedia laptops, in which the usual hardware upgrade was combined with radical design changes and spectacular, but not always obligatory, bells and whistles. <br><br>  The laptop can not boast a record battery life or low weight, but perfectly serves as a home entertainment center.  Games, movies and music - that's what it takes to use this laptop. <br><br>  pros <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ New design <br>  ‚Ä¢ Hardware stuffing <br>  ‚Ä¢ Matte screen <br>  ‚Ä¢ Keyboard backlighting <br>  ‚Ä¢ Aluminum finish <br>  ‚Ä¢ Only USB 3.0 ports <br>  ‚Ä¢ High-quality acoustics <br>  ‚Ä¢ Heat dissipation and noise <br><br>  Minuses <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Thickness and weight * <br>  ‚Ä¢ Battery life <br>  ‚Ä¢ Prints may remain on the cover. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Low screen resolution ** <br>  * <i>At the same time, ASUS N56 is not much heavier, but ASUS N76 weighs 3.58 kg already</i> <br>  ** <i>Only ASUS N46</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147213/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147213/</a></p>
