We write on anything, we solder everything that can be soldered.  Own, small laboratory for carrying out hellish experiments. <br>  A sufficient number of friends, acquaintances, customers who support us.  And confronting <br>  we have various tasks.  Sometimes these tasks generate, in addition to the main product, also a secondary one. <br><br>  Today I will tell not about the main thing, but about the product that we accidentally created.  Born he <br>  thanks to this chain: <br><br>  Removed statistics from a special technology (did and did) -&gt; <br>  Jokes about remote control of a 50-ton trawl (we want, but so far there is no time) -&gt; <br>  Returning to the earth with the thought that this is fun, to manage something -&gt; <br>  Familiar, with his constant trips to the country and the inclusion of the heater to something <br>  there is not frozen and not burst.  Comrade wanted a simple piece of iron.  To stuck it and <br>  it all worked.  So that, without going to the country, he could turn on and off his boiler.

      Offhand.  We had an extension cord.  There was a cell phone. <br> <a href="http://tinypic.com/view.php%3Fpic%3D345bkia%26s%3D5"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/037/4cf/215/0374cf215d13f48315afb29378df8bac.jpg" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a> <br><br>  And I wanted something like this: <br> <a href="http://tinypic.com/view.php%3Fpic%3D95pf79%26s%3D5"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8e2/47e/7e0/8e247e7e061991189dc42a0f3eadc4f1.jpg" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a> <br><br>  Well, or, as an option, in the most extreme case - like this: <br> <a href="http://tinypic.com/view.php%3Fpic%3D30kyf11%26s%3D5"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/95e/be5/f43/95ebe5f43972f733fee521e93f88b54b.jpg" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The idea was like that.  We take the extension cord, open it, push the smart brain inside, close it. <br><br>  Let's go to the store.  Bought extension cords.  They are all so different.  And inside, on average, the same. <br>  Lousy.  There is little space.  Wiring is in disarray.  And sometimes - also poorly soldered. <br><br>  The extender must be of a quality assembly (so that we do not have to repair it first), <br>  there should be a lot of space in it for the brain to fit in.  Well, zhelezyachnik, put the requirement <br>  by the presence on the extension of individual switches on each outlet. <br><br>  He motivated it with all sorts of tricky words, but all I remember is a separate one. <br>  tire on each outlet. <br><br>  Having ditched a dozen extenders, we chose the base and below it will be in the photos. <br><br>  In order to remotely manage something, we need to do the following: <br>  - Provide a channel for transmitting commands <br>  - Install something that will turn the load on and off <br><br>  We took as a basis one of our glands (satellite monitoring of transport) threw out <br>  See superfluous (gps module) added relyushki and altered power supply, because <br>  it is very rare to have 220 volts in the vehicle‚Äôs electrical network (I‚Äôve only seen this on the RDK-250, <br>  but he is still a monster).  I corrected the program, added management via SMS.  And that's all. <br><br>  Put aside the keyboard.  Take a soldering iron.  :) <br><br> <a href="http://tinypic.com/view.php%3Fpic%3D2ef2jwh%26s%3D5"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ff/45a/967/0ff45a96786d69a9ed6e05840fee0e0a.jpg" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a> <br>  Great extension cord.  We analyze it. <br><br> <a href="http://tinypic.com/view.php%3Fpic%3D3584bpx%26s%3D5"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c19/096/f8b/c19096f8be1a33cffa11547350427c14.jpg" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a> <br>  Just a little inside, right?  And this is the best extension cord we have prepared. <br><br>  To me, the programmer, the concept of a draft program is known for a very long time.  And everything is simple - did not go <br>  rolled back or erased.  Earned - unreleased.  And what are the drafts of those who solder?  Like these ones: <br> <a href="http://tinypic.com/view.php%3Fpic%3D302nk07%26s%3D5"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e2c/b79/b3c/e2cb79b3c4822129e6696ea151c8da02.jpg" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a> <br>  In the picture, by the way, you can see those relyushki about which I wrote above.  and that <br>  cute shiny bun in the bottom of the extension is modern, inexpensive, <br>  gsm-gprs modem.  The thing is useful to us because it can accept-send sms.nu and, also, if necessary, connect to the Internet via gprs. <br><br>  The need to connect to the Internet is.  Sometimes someone wants to add to the possibilities. <br>  something new, I write code, I send a special secret SMS to the extension number, it <br>  connects to the internet, connects to our update server and downloads a new one <br>  firmware.  Then he reprograms himself.  On the other hand, if no new features you <br>  No need - you will never know about such an opportunity. <br><br>  In general, having estimated the sizes, having drawn the shemka and the printed circuit board - we make the first prototype of the printed circuit <br>  fees.  In the modern world - everything is done via the Internet.  You send the drawing to the office, which <br>  makes payments, agree everything, they invoice, you pay it, wait a week and <br>  Your handbag, right in the lab, brought ready-made scarves.  Here they are, greenbacks, on the photo. <br> <a href="http://tinypic.com/view.php%3Fpic%3D25jz38y%26s%3D5"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7c3/9dd/ef2/7c39ddef2bdfd0d81c678856bd3ac941.jpg" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a> <br><br>  On one outlet goes two scarves.  Like so safer - corrects me, my zhelezyachnik.  On one <br>  low-voltage, but the high-frequency part (processor, memory, watch ‚Äî everything is like everyone else‚Äôs), to another <br>  board, food, and relyushki.  On one of the boards, we will also install a symbol holder, so that you can stick <br>  Simcard of your favorite operator. <br><br> <a href="http://tinypic.com/view.php%3Fpic%3D2jea4vd%26s%3D5"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7d7/de7/937/7d7de7937eaae46002c662b9746a377c.jpg" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a> <br>  We solder one of the boards.  Install the power converter, relay. <br><br> <a href="http://tinypic.com/view.php%3Fpic%3Da2zotz%26s%3D5"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/264/9c1/acf/2649c1acfd750852202a68caa5148a44.jpg" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a> <br>  The second one is on its way - there is a processor, a simholder and some small things on it <br><br> <a href="http://tinypic.com/view.php%3Fpic%3D1rxagx%26s%3D5"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d7/007/341/0d70073413e6d25b7212103d37c8fd39.jpg" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a> <br>  and collect them in a sandwich :) <br><br> <a href="http://tinypic.com/view.php%3Fpic%3D1fftyu%26s%3D5"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5c2/84e/49a/5c284e49ac2c03dfa128d7b748d25783.jpg" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a> <br>  Further, everything is completely simple, we throw out the ‚Äúnative‚Äù switches, and add our special ones.  With bright <br>  backlit.  And the ability to taxi this backlight programmatically. <br><br>  After that, fill in the extension with a fresh firmware (I wrote a simple OS for all of our <br>  glands and now just reassemble it for various needs.  oc takes about 30kbytes, can <br>  all that is written above + if necessary, satellite navigation + protection of the borders of our homeland <br>  humanoid robots).  We shove everything that turned out in the case, add street magic, <br>  and all  gsmrozetka ready. <br><br>  Here, according to the canons is hot, there should be a photo of the resulting device, but I will not insert it. <br>  Because externally, from the purchased extension cord, our piece of iron differs only in a narrow gap <br>  Simholder in the board.  So we will save you traffic. <br><br>  ps <br>  somehow I will write about the creation of the same piece of iron, but sharpened to the server rack.  in the case of U1. <br>  here is a secret photo of the beginning of work on its prototype <br> <a href="http://tinypic.com/view.php%3Fpic%3Dwisdbc%26s%3D5"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/19e/f25/59c/19ef2559c2c049ae78676b8bf5cd069b.jpg" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/54683/">https://habr.com/ru/post/54683/</a></p>
