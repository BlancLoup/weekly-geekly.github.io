But, since very few habrayusers know about us, here is just one sentence describing our occupation: <br><br><h6>  "Network Academy LANIT" - a training center offering training in IT-areas. </h6><br>  The company's blog will feature articles about the IT world, written by both ordinary employees and our Director, some information on courses and certifications, and something else that we think may be useful or interesting to you. <br>  Hopefully, the community will take us into their ranks. <br><br>  So, the article from Dmitry Izmestyev: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When choosing an IT training center, a specialist or company must, first of all, decide what it is planned to receive from the training.  Depending on the answer to this question, it is necessary to form selection criteria

    <h4>  1. Authorized or not? </h4><br>  An authorized training center must implement a strict standard defined by the vendor, that is, the same authorized course in different countries of the world, in principle, should look identical, with minor amendments to the instructor‚Äôs identity and national traditions.  In addition, receiving authorization, the training center undertakes to ensure an adequate level of training.  In order to receive confirmation of authorization of the center you are interested in or simply to quickly find the nearest authorized training center, you can go to the page of the representative office of companies (for example, <a href="http://www.microsoft.ru/">www.microsoft.ru</a> , <a href="http://www.novell.ru/">www.novell.ru</a> , <a href="http://www.oracle.ru/">www.oracle.ru</a> , <a href="http://www.sco.com/">www.sco. com</a> , etc.).  All centers that have actually passed authorization must be on the vendor's website with addresses and coordinates for communication. <br>  It happens that there is simply no corporate training on the necessary product.  So, it will be necessary to study for some authoring.  It is worth wondering who has already worked on this program, whether it has recommendations from colleagues, whether it is approved by the vendor, whether it is tied to certification programs. <br><br><h4>  2. Universal or profiled? </h4><br>  Among the authorized training centers there are universal and specialized.  What type of preference?  An unequivocal answer to this question is impossible.  On the one hand, a specialized training center, for example, on Oracle should read courses on these products better than all other educational institutions.  Although a large universal training center can afford to have a large number of specialized specialists in various fields, which guarantees the quality of education.  On the other hand, a universal training center is convenient for those who are going to attend not one, but several courses.  And yet: multidisciplinary training centers are a certain circle of contacts, the opportunity to exchange experience with colleagues and coaches, not limited to a single product or a single methodology. <br><br><h4>  3. Training conditions. </h4><br>  Find out how many classes in the training center, how conveniently they are located, how they are equipped, whether students are provided with free food, other infrastructure.  Oddly enough, but all this improves the quality of education, although it affects the price. <br><br><h4>  4. Qualified instructors. </h4><br>  It is worth wondering whether the instructor of the course of interest has certificates: how many and which ones.  If he has not only mandatory coaching, but others, it increases his value and competence.  An instructor may specialize in one or several areas.  As practice shows, it is more convenient and more productive to communicate with a specialist who owns a wide range of issues.  It is easier to find a common language with him, since he will be able to appeal to the already existing knowledge and skills of the other products. <br><br><h4>  5. Tutorials. </h4><br>  Authorized textbooks are very different from copyright textbooks.  The system of authorized training as a whole, and each of its components individually debugged over the years.  The main advantage of proprietary methods and textbooks is that not a single second of the time paid by you is wasted, and there is nothing in the textbook that would not be useful in the future.  It is also necessary to find out whether the benefits remain with the students - they can be very useful. <br><br><h4>  6. Warranties. </h4><br>  A serious training center ensures that the listener, dissatisfied with the quality of training, will be able to take the same course free of charge from another instructor. <br><br><h4>  7. Price issue. </h4><br>  Before making a final choice, it is necessary to determine the overall price level in the market.  The cost of training for similar courses in different centers can not be too different.  Excessively low price should cause serious concerns, since such a reduction is possible only by excluding any components from the learning process: these can be branded textbooks or a simplified course program.  The only way to safely save on training is to follow the marketing campaigns of educational institutions.  The presence of such (seasonal discounts, additional benefits, gift certificates) is, by the way, another argument in favor.  As only large educational companies that actively interact in the market can afford such actions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98562/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98562/</a></p>
