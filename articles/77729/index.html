Topics about studying and, oddly enough, children, it became more than <s>9000</s> .  And once I read <a href="http://averkin.habrahabr.ru/blog/77623/">it</a> in one sitting <a href="http://averkin.habrahabr.ru/blog/77623/">, this is this</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/study/77630/">this</a> , I even got to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/the_future_is_here/39616/">these</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/the_future_is_here/55307/">topics</a> .  The sublimate of the points of view of most commentators has precipitated into the brain - ‚ÄúI am twenty years old.  I talked with children.  Where the world is heading ... ‚Äù <br><br>  Habragospod, for which you make a humiliating assessment of a whole generation based on, albeit a long but unsuccessful experience of communicating with a few representatives thereof? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  A short list of problems concerned about the future of the nation, because of which there was no successful contact with the colors of life.  Subjective view of the obvious </h4><br>  <b>Time</b> : School students are more or less disliked by schoolchildren.  Well, I do not want to sit on algebra - but I have to.  Hmm, well, since it's so boring, I'll take a look at the paper from the ballpoint pen case.  Solving specific problems is more interesting to me than abstract ones. <br><br>  <b>Two</b> : Children come to classes from home and return there.  If Google finds 11,500 pages to the query ‚Äúcan I scream at children,‚Äù maybe it‚Äôs not children?

      <b>Three</b> : Children are not representatives of another kind.  They have a small body and <s>so far there is</s> no clich√©d look at many phenomena and processes.  Will it occur to you to lisp with an unfamiliar adult?  To ask him, ‚ÄúDid you not forget your head at home?‚Äù Why I don‚Äôt know the language spoken with children is very different from Russian. <br><br>  <b>Four</b> comrades informatics teachers: Schoolchildren probably met the computer earlier than they did with you.  And therefore, they are unlikely to want to study data compression algorithms if they consider that a computer is a machine for ‚ÄúVKontakte‚Äù.  I will draw an analogy: the child loves football more than anything, and the physical education teacher tries to explain to him how interesting it is to dance with the ball.  In addition to this, the physical instructor sincerely believes that football is a stupid and senseless sport.  I would not believe this man. <br><br>  <b>Five</b> : A teacher of the same computer science interacts with an individual class of forty-five minutes and a half hours a week.  These are not his daughters and sons.  He has no time to get to know the children closely.  Therefore, the thought ‚ÄúChildren are stupid and they have no incentive to fix it‚Äù becomes the opinion of the overwhelming majority;  dissenters are <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/study/77623/">not respected</a> (there was a link to the commentary, hello, <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/futuroshock/" class="user_link">futuroshock</a> !) <br><br>  All of the above in no way contributes to the motivation of a person to learn.  Ten years ago and earlier, the current education system was more or less effective.  But a thriving consumer society gave schoolchildren mobile phones, computer games and social networks.  The choice is multimedia or ‚Äúin the old fashioned way‚Äù, with Cossacks-robbers and respect for teachers ‚Äî children are obvious. <br><br>  And now, you will not believe: <br><br><h4>  Really existing model of society children-adults, which proves that everything is not so bad </h4><br>  I have been working as a counselor in children's health camps for four years (yes, since I was sixteen).  I bow my head before the gracious readers: I am still a child, I have a little experience, the value system is different from the right one, and the syllable is clumsy.  The leader I‚Äôm so-so: my children periodically smoked, fought, ran for the territory and behaved disgustingly.  But for some reason they refused to bathe and roll in order to practice a non-obligatory dance and to fool around in front of the whole camp for the letter printed on the printer. <br><br>  Motivating children is difficult, and I get it badly.  But the situation works for the counselor.  Children come to the camp from different cities.  Some - from the neighboring village, they know "where to get" and which of the "local" can precipitate the upstart leader who "builds a lot of himself out of himself".  Others are Muscovites with relevant inquiries, who are waiting for a ‚Äúreal party‚Äù, but as a result, 80% of village children with village ideas about disco are at the evening disco.  Others are Chukchi in general, and I am not joking: my girlfriend had a detachment in which children from Chukotka saw the sea for the first time, spat on the request ‚Äúnot to dive‚Äù and - oil painting: children swim like children all over the beach, and in the square 4 * 4 meters out of the water sticking out the legs and heads of teenagers with persons who have lost their virginity nerds. <br><br>  So, the situation works for the counselor.  Children in most cases do not have a number of friends and relatives.  No one knows anything about them.  They have not settled down yet.  And in the new environment they can try to be realized in the same way as it does not work at home, where every dog ‚Äã‚Äãknows: this one is a teacher, this one is neither fish nor fowl, this one is a deranged juvenile delinquent, and the environment does not give a single step back from its usual role .  Naturally, there are factors working in the opposite direction: in the opinion of the authors of the wikestat about rest, "... rest will include such stages: fatigue, relaxation, recuperation, entertainment."  Children go to the camp, again I repeat, swim-sunbathe-eat-sleep, and not make costumes from plastic bottles, draw posters and spend hours learning the words of a fairy tale for an evening event.  But in order to get what you want from the children, you need to explain why you need it, and at the same time be honest with them in everyday communication (without an adult snout and / or substitution of concepts).  Well, the flow is already up to you. <br><br>  What are you worth - go ahead, I know a cool game, collect a squad, I will tell the rules. <br><br>  Yes, I have one thing, I can only entrust him to you.  Do you exactly?  I can trust you? <br><br>  Guys, I know one psychological training, but you probably will not like it.  Yes, and it is difficult.  I‚Äôll just leave the printed rules to you, if you want, you can spend it yourself. <br><br><h4>  I, of course, wildly sorry </h4><br>  Education and recreation are different things, and I understand that the conditions of the hostel, the common dining room and the round-the-clock society, such as they, require from the teenagers a different behavior model from the school.  But it <b>infuriates</b> me <b>that children can be considered bad and stupid</b> .  Children are good!  Not any definite, but all!  I had kids in the squads, for whom I was an adult uncle, and sixteen-year-old foreheads were taller and wider than me.  There were children from Krasnodar, Rostov-on-Don, Grozny.  Everyone in one way or another, in one capacity or another, and on this or that day of the shift, revealed himself and made him remember. <br><br>  Children do not want to learn - the problem, but the problem is not in them.  This is the fault of their parents, the company, the authors of the curriculum.  Children behave disgustingly - terrible, but try to make sure that they do not have it before.  How?  I do not know.  I do not teach children, but I try to organize a successful and memorable summer vacation for them.  And I somehow get it.  Because they understand that from the world in which they can be themselves, they have to return to the study-work-pension series filled with complexes and duties.  Well, of course, everything is not so tragic, but any children cry at the end of any shift. <br><br>  Total: the world does not roll into the abyss.  At least the one in which I live. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : I lived a few more years, reread the post and decided to explain a little what exactly I had in mind in some cases. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77729/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77729/</a></p>
