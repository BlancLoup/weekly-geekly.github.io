  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Keyboard overview for PS3 controller</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In principle, keyboard overlays for game controllers, they are Messenger Kit, they are also ThumbPads, they are ChatPads, are not the first subject of gaming necessity, because the text on PS3 can be entered using a regular gamepad: yes, difficult, yes Hemorrhoids, but still possible.  However, if any game (say, Killzone 3) with a terrific multiplayer, which implies constant communication, has captured you completely and does not want to let go of its strong embrace, you should think about buying such a mega-device. <br><br>  Certain irresponsible comrades will probably ask us a question: do you need a keyboard on the fig when PS3 has a great opportunity for both voice communication in the game and for sending voice messages?  The answer is: of course, the importance of voice communication is difficult to overestimate.  However, the Messenger Kit rules in two situations: first, it is necessary when voice communication is impossible or undesirable (for example, you decided to relax at the console in the evening after work, and your little child fell asleep).  Secondly, ChatPad can provide a good service when you play online with foreigners, whose English sometimes has such a monstrous accent that you simply cannot do without ‚Äúsubtitles‚Äù.  And finally, you shouldn‚Äôt discount the category of citizens who, instead of discussing the issue on their mobile in two minutes, prefer to give each other twenty SMS messages for half an hour. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Immediately make a reservation that our review will probably turn out to be somewhat one-sided with a serious bias towards the PlayStation's native keyboard.  But there are reasons for this.  Firstly, ChatPads of other manufacturers in Russia are almost impossible to get, secondly, they do not have a Russian layout, and, thirdly, other devices are objectively more cumbersome.  However, to the point. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/e27251b0/6c2728c0/5055d7d1/43d8789e.jpg">

      The first thing the user finds when removing the keyboard from the box is the absence of any additional components.  And they are not needed: to make ChatPad work, it‚Äôs enough to charge it with a mini USB from the PS3 gamepad, which is included in any console model, for 3 hours.  The weight of the device is only 60 g, so any insinuations that the Messenger Kit somehow weighs down the controller and prevents the gameplay - from the evil one.  Externally, the device looks very stylish and high-quality, and so organically fits into the concept and visual style of the Sonivan gamepad, that after a couple of weeks of use, it is no longer possible to present them separately from each other.  Fastened ThumbPad to the controller in the manner of fasteners, clips, which is very convenient. <br><br>  The keyboard has two layouts: English and Russian, and the language of Shakespeare, for once, is in opposition to the great and mighty: Russian letters are twice as large as English letters.  All the function keys that the user is used to on the computer keyboard are also present: Esc, BackSpace, CapcLock, Left and Right Shift, Enter, Space and function arrows.  On the sides of the device on the site of "bamerov" are blue and orange buttons, which are responsible for entering alternative values. <br><br>  Some complain that the buttons on the Messenger Kit are too small, but in our opinion, typing text on it is just as convenient as, say, on a BlackBerry smartphone, and indeed on any mobile phone.  A matter of habit and only. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/2f59a23b/c265dcbf/428cfccb/c780348a.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/ad3935d2/bc3ea2c2/24b3ae91/b85a8d4f.jpg"><br><br>  A keyboard from a well-known world leader in the production of gaming devices would also seem like a good choice, if not for its monstrous dimensions.  However, for those for whom the size does not matter, you may like the somewhat larger size of the keys, compared to the original Messenger Kit from Sony.  This device also connects to the controller in the manner of a clip and works from a Bluetooth transmitter connected to the console via a USB port. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3e453cd4/72226dd2/02f26b54/f206fe6c.jpg"><br><br>  Finally, ChatPads from two Australian manufacturers Hive Accessories and PowerWave, differing only in name, are the least reasonable choice.  Firstly, this ThumbPad is not attractive from the visual point of view, and secondly, this thing is rather difficult, considering that it works from two AAA batteries.  It differs from the Sony and Mad Catz keyboards in the square size of the keys.  It is noteworthy that it is located below, and not on top of the controller, as in the products of competitors.  However, whether it is good or bad is up to the consumer. <br><br>  Summary: objectively, the PS3 keyboard is the best one presented for the test.  Both visually and functionally.  Well, is this device for you a product from the category must have - you decide.  But we would recommend! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125099/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125099/</a></p>
