Obviously, the opposite is also true: to achieve a result, it is necessary to test different approaches and get invaluable experience, which, as we know, is ‚Äúthe son of difficult mistakes‚Äù. <br><br>  Adapting a new software product in a company is not easy, as it may seem at first glance.  Here we need the appropriate experience and a special approach.  The situation is quite typical when such an initiative encounters a wall of misunderstanding of employees who do not want to try something new.  Most are just afraid of change!  Even if, as a result, work can become easier and more enjoyable. <br><br>  What is the way out?  After all, to optimize work sooner or later you still have to, so as not to be left behind, and it is better to do it earlier in order to maximize the competitive advantages.

      Let us consider the conditions under which employees themselves would advocate such integration, and did not do so by order from above.  So, first of all it follows: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Make contact with colleagues</b> </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c1/101/5cc/9c11015cc9cb42e6b56e80208cf30066.png" alt="contact with colleagues"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Deployment of the software product should not occur solely at the behest of the management.  This, in most cases, is doomed to failure.  People need to understand what advantages a new solution will give them and what they will get as a result.  It is necessary to analyze different opinions, and on the basis of them to build a strategy of behavior.  If it is not quite clear to the employees why the whole process is being undertaken, it is worth telling what benefits the product will provide and how the benefits are expressed specifically for each of them.  Close contact is very important for effective teamwork and directly affects the success of integration. <br><br>  I remember very well the time when in our company everyone communicated via ICQ (yes, through the already forgotten ‚ÄúICQ‚Äù).  But at some point, management decided that it was not safe enough and you should transfer everyone to Jabber with setting up your own server for secure information exchange.  Employees resisted at first, but when they conducted a clear educational program and it became clear to everyone that this was about the company's information security, we realized that this was the only correct option. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Set clear goals</b> </li></ul><br>  Software automation as a tribute to fashion is a waste of money and time.  It is necessary to clearly understand what problem this particular product is designed to solve and how.  Otherwise, you just can not massively use it on an ongoing basis. <br><br>  Due to fierce competition in its field, Harsh International, a leading manufacturer of equipment for feeding animal feed, has been constantly resorting to innovative ideas for over 70 years to stand out among competitors.  The last major task was the deployment of computer-aided design (CAD) based on Solid Edge from Siemens, which allowed using 2D and 3D models to quickly change the initial design of the equipment based on customer requests.  As a result, the company has firmly occupied the niche of complex, individual projects that are inaccessible to most competitors. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Consciously choose a solution</b> </li></ul><br>  Usually the goal can be achieved in different ways and there are many software alternatives.  It is important not to get lost and not to get confused.  The most optimal choice: from the point of view of the end user.  The effectiveness of such a project depends on how clear and convenient it is to use the system. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Teach product handling</b> </li></ul><br>  No matter how easy and intuitive the system is, a clear instruction is always needed to use it.  It will not be superfluous to create a work schedule in it, with which each employee should be acquainted.  In addition, you can order a specialist consultation: in most cases, it is relatively inexpensive and will pay off with interest. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce1/fec/a9b/ce1feca9be6e4f19b0de1a5cfb18c6ad.png" alt="application training"><br><br>  According to the Association for ATD (The Association for Talent Development), in 2013 in the United States organizations <a href="https://www.td.org/Publications/Magazines/TD/TD-Archive/2014/11/2014-State-of-the-Industry-Report-Spending-on-Employee-Training-Remains-a-Priority">spent an average of $ 1,208 per year</a> per employee for staff training and development.  At the same time, 2/3 of the budget was spent on internal training.  In Russia, this figure is still much more modest - in 2012, the average expenditures of companies amounted to <a href="http://www.pwc.ru/ru/press-releases/2013/saratoga_2013.jhtml">9,900 rubles per employee</a> per year, respectively (which, at the weighted average USD rate for 2012, was $ 318), but at the same time investments in staff training are growing much faster in Russia than in the US (+ 30% against a modest + 1%). <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Track usage regularity</b> </li></ul><br>  It is not enough to deploy an IT system in an enterprise; it is also necessary to create prerequisites for its regular use.  If this is a tool without which it is impossible to imagine the work of one or another employee, then it does not take much effort to establish regular activity in it.  If the software product has any alternative (for example, CRM and MS Excel, Pyrus and e-mail, etc.), create conditions under which the employee will be more comfortable using the appropriate solution.  Here you can take certain stimulating steps and even apply the ‚Äúcarrot and stick‚Äù method: for example, rely on bonuses only for projects established in CRM (in our case, <a href="https://www.amocrm.ru/">amoCRM</a> ) or by tasks (in <a href="https://pyrus.com/ru/">Pyrus</a> ) that were successfully completed on time. <br><br>  What is your experience in integrating new software products? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294408/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294408/</a></p>
