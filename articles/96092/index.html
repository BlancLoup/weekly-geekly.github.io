Before that, in an interview with the Russia-24 TV channel, he <a href="http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html%3Fid%3D367125">told</a> about his intention to bring <i>order</i> to the entire Runet.  Akopov left his comments directly under the <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/app1850211">article of</a> Tsyplukhin, who clarified the situation to schoolchildren. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/156/bf2/ce4/156bf2ce485bb3e6bfff6bf2e739ee5b.jpg"><br>  Apparently, the representatives of VKontakte will be forced to respond to this parish. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  * * * * * <br><br>  Hello, dear Vkontakte Network User!

      Everyone who believes that this story has been started in order to use the Vkontakte network to draw attention to the problem of so-called ‚Äúpiracy‚Äù is absolutely right.  We call it not piracy, but theft, since the ‚Äúreal‚Äù pirates (those in children's books and in the movies) are somewhere noble and certainly cheerful people. <br><br>  I am writing here because the editorial board of VKurse turned to me for comments on my statements, for which I am very grateful to the editorial board.  Therefore, I will first make a copy-paste regarding the questions sent to me, and then I will try to answer them in detail. <br><br><img src="http://www.talismantv.ru/files/208/akopov1.jpg"><br><br>  First of all, I have to somewhat correct the messages that appeared on this topic in the media, because, unfortunately, our colleagues from the information services who were present at the meeting reproduced quite accurately the MESSAGE held last week at Sistema, but not its CONTENT. <br><br>  It was a meeting of representatives of Russian film companies, state and public organizations, IT-specialists and lawyers.  This meeting was called VOR.NET, and was dedicated to coordinating joint actions to eliminate content theft on the Internet. <br><br>  I want to emphasize that in this case we are no longer talking about charity, political speculations and other chatter that accompanied the problem in recent years, but that the problem needs to be solved finally (the terms were different, I belong to a group that considers the problem will be solved in 1.5-2 years, some colleagues believe that it will take up to 4 years). <br><br>  Let me first answer the question "why now?"  The question is committed fair, which can clarify a lot.  Indeed, the fight against illegal content throughout the world was conducted quite sluggishly and many people could get the impression that the status quo of the first years of the Internet‚Äôs existence would last forever.  Why is it now that the world film industry has declared this phenomenon ‚Äúthe last and decisive battle‚Äù?  There are two reasons. <br><br><h4>  First </h4><br>  Until recent years, there really has been little FREE LEGAL PROFESSIONAL content on the Internet.  The reasons can be discussed, the film industry‚Äôs fault in this, of course, also exists.  Our industry is distinguished by extreme conservatism and even the death of the neighboring music industry was perceived by filmmakers and television people as ‚Äúsomeone else‚Äôs misfortune‚Äù and did not lead to active actions in its defense. <br><br>  Everything began to change less than two years ago, when NBC Universal, Fox, and then Disney ABC (the three largest television networks and the three largest film companies) supported the Hulu.com project, which offered free movies and series to these American companies on the Internet.  The instant rise in popularity of Hulu.com has convinced everyone that the free (ad-supported) model of licensed professional content can live.  In a year - one and a half, models of placing films and TV series appeared on the network, which were organized by the audience, the film masters, and the television broadcasters.  New terms and legal constructions have appeared (for example, catch-up rights, that is, free screening on the Internet immediately after the premiere on television). <br><br>  The same years saw the rise of Netflix, which provides access to the latest films immediately after the end of film distribution, in parallel with the DVD release or immediately after it - this is a paid service, but the cost of the show (called rent) is lower than the price of a movie ticket.  You can also download the full movie - for the price of a DVD. <br><br><h4>  All this is already working - in the US </h4><br>  And we have?  Would you like to have all these services at your home tomorrow? <br><br>  So - the first part of the task in Russia has already been solved, which, I hope, you already know.  In recent months, free services have been launched in our country, working with LEGAL PROFESSIONAL content.  There are already FOUR (!!!) - firstly, of course, Tvigle.ru is a pioneer of legal video content in our country, and then, in order of appearance, Ivi.ru, Tvzavr.ru, and Zoomby.ru.  Next - in recent years, all Russian TV channels (and these are the owners of most of the content) have got official websites on which a significant part of their products is posted.  Moreover, the completely official Internet cinema opened Mosfilm Studio, which, it would seem, is written to be extremely conservative.  It is paid, but it collected the best of what has been done by domestic cinema for decades.  According to Zhvanetsky - it seems that we, ‚Äúchronically lagging behind,‚Äù are now ‚Äúchronically ahead‚Äù !!! <br><br>  What remains?  Yes, for now, none of these services have new American TV shows or new American cinema.  It will, of course, appear.  In a year - if we eradicate theft in a year.  Ten years from now - if we eradicate theft in ten years. <br><br>  And why do you need to eradicate theft, if everything is already working?  The sad answer is that all these organizations, which started with free content, all Russian studios and channels that provided content for them, do it today at LOSS, because the same content is available on illegal sites.  These projects can live only through advertising, and advertising appears only with appropriate attendance, and where can we get visitors from, if everyone has already seen everything on thieves' resources?  Add - out of habit (not by malicious intent)! <br><br>  So, the first reason why our industry went into the ‚Äúfinal and decisive battle‚Äù was that we fulfilled, albeit with a delay, the desire of the public to create platforms for free professional content on the Internet. <br><br>  And the second reason is Google TV and similar systems, which were announced literally in recent weeks and which will be distributed in millions of copies over the next year or two.  They are cheap and they will even allow your grandmother to easily output video from the Internet to a large TV screen in your living room.  Google TV and the ability to watch videos from the Internet on the big screen is a great invention that certainly opens up great opportunities for viewers and for the industry.  But if you do not eliminate the sources of the stolen content, this is already a ‚Äúdirect and obvious threat‚Äù to the legal construction of the information space.  While there was a struggle for computer screens, the film industry and television were, frankly, relatively calm.  Computers were relatively small, the channels a couple of years ago were mostly narrow, the video went bad and poor quality.  But suddenly, in just a couple of years, it turned out that there were almost 45 million computers and fast Internet channels in our country !!!  Movie and TV people all over the world suddenly realized that the struggle had gone for the ‚Äúholiest‚Äù ‚Äîthe television in the living room. <br><br><h4>  But not only TV people understand this. </h4><br>  The Internet in its current form (call me conservative) - with its very specific ideas about ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù, seriously worries people who are responsible, for example, about raising their children.  The ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù of the spread of porn, foul language, violence, extremism, cannot come to a large family screen.  (Just don‚Äôt butt me with the fact that today on TV and so over the edge of violence and low-mindedness - firstly, I also don‚Äôt like it very much, secondly, it‚Äôs ‚Äúflowers‚Äù ‚Äã‚Äãcompared to what‚Äôs happening on the Internet).  And although many do not like philosophy or history, considering it to be boring sciences, it is these sciences that provide the key to a simple and obvious prediction: the Internet will not have ‚Äúabsolute‚Äù freedom, simply because it does not exist, has never been, and never will be in human society .  She was for a while, until no one understood to the end what the Internet was.  Fashionable "cyber - libertarian" views that the Internet, allegedly, "finally" will give mankind absolute freedom - this is nonsense that is spread by people who have not done well in school.  And those who studied well can see the future.  Here are a few quotes from one person who studied well: <br><br>  "... users get huge amounts of information that is not always true."  "... the most idiotic appeals can instantly gain popularity" "... communication tools do not always follow the values ‚Äã‚Äãof a democratic society."  "... information ceases to be a means of ensuring the rights and freedoms of citizens. All this harms both the country as a whole and individual people."  The fact that many are embarrassed to say, fearing that they would be accused of clamping down on democracy, was voiced by the president of a country that would like to consider itself ‚Äúthe most free‚Äù, Barack Obama, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hcoyG-Ck3-VwZB7fqpUFXbffoObg">on May 10, 2010</a> . <br><br>  I think the answer to the question ‚Äúwhy now?‚Äù Already explains a lot. <br><br><h4>  Now about the particulars </h4><br>  Our Russian film companies will announce the strategy of their actions at the beginning of autumn.  Participate in the action will be the companies-members of the Association of film and television producers, television channels, as well as any other organizations that they deem necessary.  I will not reveal the big secrets, the sequence is presented as follows: <br><br>  Russian film companies will openly address all Internet users with a request not to post videos, music, literary, photo content, which rights are not granted to you explicitly (in writing), in the Internet services available to the unlimited circle of people.  (When you buy a DVD or watch a legal site, these rights are granted to you for private viewing - this is written in small letters on each disc and each legal site).  We will warn you that when you are offered to place content somewhere ‚Äúat your own peril and risk‚Äù, when sites state that they are ‚Äúnot responsible‚Äù for the content you post, it is possible that this is a trap, it may push you to break the law, which will answer YOU PERSONALLY, and not just the owners or operators of the site.  If you are not sure that you have the rights to host such content, it is better not to download, not to send such content to the repositories, where they can become publicly available.  The same goes for loading and streaming content.  We will try to explain everything in as much detail as possible. <br><br>  Next, we will post in the press a list of sites on which illegal content is noticed.  Of course, (answering questions 4 and 5), the site can be IN CONTACT, YouTube, and any other well-known sites where illegal content will be noticed (and documented).  We will offer them to remove illegal content from their sites.  But it‚Äôs not just bans.  We can offer sites to switch to completely legal models of work, for example, hosting the players of legal video content sites.  We will, of course, be open to discussing any such models.  In this case, users may not notice anything at all - just at one point, illegal content will be replaced by legal. <br><br>  Understanding that this can take a lot of time, we will give this time to the appropriate sites.  It seems that several months will be enough to understand that legal issues have been resolved, technical issues may take longer. <br><br>  We very much hope that the owners and managers of the largest sites will gather somewhere together and agree with each other to switch to the legal model.  That would be the greatest proof of the fairness of the world for millions of people.  This could be called a civil feat.  In fact, I do not think that, for example, the network of Vkontakte was created in order to post a stolen video - just the loading and viewing functionality was implemented, and then it turned out ‚Äúas always‚Äù.  And even more so, I do not think that the audience of the network will run away if only links to the legal video remain in it. <br><br>  We all very much hope that this will all end and that the question will be settled with peace. <br><br>  But if it fails, then we will distribute between 20 companies the responsibility for filing claims, for example, to the 20 largest remaining thieves sites, without distinction of names and origin.  And win them.  Today, the legislative base is ready for this, and judicial practice is tightening.  And most importantly, the law is on our side.  And now he is on our side, because the logic of History has come to this. <br><br>  But then - if someone from the site owners continues to persist that the users themselves have stolen the video on their website ... (honestly, if they continue to CONNECT you), and the user will insist that he knows neither about what rights, he is like ‚Äúfor freedom‚Äù and so on, claims will be filed against such malicious individuals.  But you personally will not do this? <br><br>  By that time you will have a lot of legal videos on legal sites - why do you personally need these adventures? <br><br>  You will have a lot of content for free and without advertising - many TV shows, concerts, music videos, popular science and entertainment programs will be available on this model.  Here there is always a place for the production of independent studios, young authors who are just beginning their creative path. <br><br>  The main part of the content will be available on the advertising model.  This is the majority of Russian and foreign TV shows, films older than 6-12 months from the date of release.  But after all, advertising on the Internet is much less in the way than on TV?  Who prevents the fact that all the great Google actually lives only on advertising? <br><br>  And, of course, there will be paid content - this is the freshest of our and foreign films, some foreign TV shows, for example, if you want to watch them on the day of their first show in the USA.  And it can not be stolen and put somewhere for free.  It will be necessary for an adult to wait a few weeks until the rights for a free show are revealed.  This is the most difficult thing that shines for you in a new model of life.  Do not stand it?  Or find a way to earn a hundred rubles and see for money? <br><br>  And, finally, about "30 million criminals."  Thank you for calling it hyperbole, as you learned in school in literature classes.  In response, I confess to the Internet language, it was the trolling that caused the flame.  This is just a call for responsible behavior.  This is a call not to joke with the article of the Criminal Code, which promises up to 6 years. <br><br>  But if you call me a copywriter, I will strongly object.  For as it is said in your own Internet encyclopedia Lukomroye (by the way, an incredibly talented example of modern Russian literature, albeit a hooligan one), a copywriter is a person who MISSES copyright.  I hate them myself, on occasion I am ready to tell a few stories.  We do not abuse, I hope.  Just insist on their own and your rights.  And you do not abuse.  The Internet often compels the use of evil, and we will try to use the good. <br><br>  I really want to see the country - in order, and you happy. <br><br>  And please study well.  I say this because I understand that you, dear Network User V Kontakte, are under 18 years old.  Otherwise you would have all that I‚Äôm talking about would already know. <br><br>  Yours, Alexander Akopov <br><br>  * * * * * <br><br>  Runet waiting for a serious change? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96092/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96092/</a></p>
