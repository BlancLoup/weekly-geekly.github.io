It is clear that visitors did not know about it, so the trickle of 25-centovik did not dry out.  But at one moment the rights holders, who were not particularly favorable for the administration of the mentioned site, came across the site and decided to punish its owners.  A lawsuit was filed in court, and the judge, having considered all aspects of the case, decided to impose a fine in the amount of 950 thousand dollars on the creators of the site BlueBeat.com.  The money confiscated from the unfortunate sellers will go to the holders. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  It is worth noting that this site now does not carry out illegal activities.  But in 2009, Media Rights Technologies, which owned this site, sold music not only to Beatles, but also to Radiohead, Coldplay, Bonnie Raitt, and other groups.  By the way, the site was quite popular, since during the existence of the site more than 67 thousand songs by The Beatles alone have been sold.  By the way, at that time the Beatles music was not on iTunes.

      The court considered the case of the company and its website since 2009, and only now the court ruled a huge fine.  Interestingly, the site owners tried to justify themselves by the fact that they were selling not ordinary musical compositions, but music, rewritten by means of a ‚Äúpsycho-acoustic simulation‚Äù, and therefore all the music files sold by the service do not belong to the copyright holders.  In general, the court found the weight of this nonsense nonsense, and imposed a punishment. <br><br>  As for the site, its owners are trying to negotiate with the right holders, and the contract should be quite large-scale - in fact there are about 800 thousand records.  By the way, the company Media Rights Technologies believes that now it has the right to sell music, since all the fines have been paid, and the agreement with the owners of rights seems to have been almost reached. <br><br>  Apparently, the guys made good money on counterfeit music, since Media Rights Technologies, having paid almost a million dollars, continues to work. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110329/ap_en_mu/us_emi_beatles_lawsuit">yahoo</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116448/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116448/</a></p>
