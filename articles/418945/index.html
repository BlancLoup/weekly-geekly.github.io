However, the ICO still has not lost its attractiveness, so it makes sense to carefully study their endless list in search of a ‚Äúdiamond‚Äù. <br><br>  I would like to emphasize the importance of conducting my own search, and repeated, before investing.  The number of projects without a serious approach, developers or any implementation of the blockchain technology is simply amazing. <br><br>  As already mentioned, despite the problematic nature of the search, there are still a lot of good projects and this article lists the 10 best ICOs for August 2018. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Menlo one </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zy/ot/jw/zyotjw7pkh6v-xlcggst9fto5ne.png">

      Menlo One is a powerful platform for developing decentralized applications.  Menlo One provides users with functionality that can avoid any problems associated with the sale of tokens.  Users will only need to configure the profile once according to their KYC / AML requirements, after which participation in the sale of cryptocurrencies will be as simple as choosing the number of tokens that you can buy with one click.  The system will also automate the purchase of tokens from upcoming sales, which will enable users to set up a purchase once and soon receive a notification that their purchase was successful. <br><br>  Menlo One is built on its own distributed database (the result of three years of research and development), which is stored in a decentralized network and uses the security guarantees of public blockchains, such as Ethereum and other distributed databases.  The platform includes an orderly, interactive and social element.  One of the components of a multi-tier platform called HashGuilds encourages other more experienced users to create reviews, evaluate and signal to all users of the platform about the emergence of high-quality ICOs. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://www.menlo.one/">ICO website</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://menloone.docsend.com/view/zgf6d4e">White book</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://t.me/Menloone">Chat with creators</a> <br><br><h3>  VogoV </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/un/jg/sk/unjgsk7d5w9fqc8tfbljkoer4om.png"><br><br>  Porn and blockchain.  Cryptomaniac dream.  VogoV is an adult entertainment studio in Los Angeles that produces and distributes high-quality 4k content as well as virtual reality video.  Within this studio, the decision making process for producing adult video is decentralized.  This means that each token holder can vote for the content that is being prepared for creation.  Scenarios, participating actors and actresses, and other aspects of creating content are amenable to voting within the framework of a voting agreement. <br><br>  The project was founded by Alexey Mayetny (Marcus Dupri) - the city of Russian porn, as he is the only Russian actor who received ‚ÄúPorn Oscars‚Äù and recognition in ‚ÄúPorn Hollywood‚Äù.  According to AVN and XRCO, Alexey is the best actor in the world in 2018.  Also, project advisors are Bridgette B, top actress, and Rocco Siffredi (Rocco Siffredi), a legendary actor and producer who won over 40 Porn Oscars. <br><br>  OGO coin, the project token (ERC223), allows not only to participate in voting on content production, but also to pay for goods and services in a safe and anonymous way, which is typical of Ethereum.  But the value of the token does not end there either, since the OGO coin gives a real and substantial discount to several large porn sites with exclusive paid content, as well as to a number of smaller, but also popular resources.  One of the main partners of the project are TeenMegaWorld and TmwVRnet, which offers a discount of 3 times the amount when paying in OGO coin. <br><br>  Since VogoV aims to become the main player for working with cryptocurrency in the $ 100 billion industry, they are developing OgoShift, which is positioned as a cryptocurrency infrastructure.  In fact, OgoShift includes 4 products: wallet, payment system, stock exchange, marketplace.  Wallet is a single point of access to all products.  How much it turned out to find out, then there is a chance that we should expect the release of the wallet in the very near future.  The OgoShift payment system is already connected to a number of sites of the project partners and is undergoing alpha testing.  Also, the payment system is in the process of integration or is already integrated with NATS. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://vogov.io/">ICO website</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://vogov.io/VogoV%2520White%2520Paper%2520v1.0.pdf%3Fv%3D1.0.1">White book</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://t.me/VogoV_official">Chat with creators</a> <br><br><h3>  Qravity </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mi/ef/rq/miefrqjkvmnla2p7i1g-kfa1n9m.png"><br><br>  The Qravity platform will become a place for developers where they can collaborate in creating content and monetizing their products. <br><br>  Developers will be able to secure their work using the implementation of the blockchain technology and will be able to sell their products, such as articles, music and videos using this platform. <br><br>  Qravity focuses on joint projects and offers a fair distribution of nailed on the basis of value added.  With each sale of the product, the distribution of profits will occur through the use of "smart" contracts. <br><br>  The Qravity Token based on the Ethereum (QCO) will be used to distribute profit shares among the team members involved in the project, promote products based on the platform to the market, track the generated digital content, and most importantly - to pay. <br><br>  The Qravity platform has an interesting approach to creative work, as it focuses on streamlined creative workflow and joint activities. <br><br>  Preliminary sales of Qravity will begin on July 1, 2018, as the next stage after the 1st round of ICO, held in July 2017.  For more information on both the Qravity project and the ICO, visit their website, read their technical documentation, and monitor the team blog. <br><br>  The platform is developed by a team of Ukrainian developers <a href="https://steelkiwi.com/">SteelKiwi</a> . <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://qravity.com/ru/">ICO website</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://qravity.com/en/whitepaper/">White book</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://t.me/QravityCom">Chat with creators</a> <br><br><h3>  Coti </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qo/uj/7l/qouj7lqrpth1gzugcqdph_icyuk.png"><br><br>  Coti is an acronym for the English term ‚ÄúInternet Currency‚Äù and was developed for full compatibility with traditional payment systems such as Visa, Mastercard and PayPal. <br><br>  The COTI development team has set itself a goal to create a project, using the advantages of the decentralized accounting technology without blockchain flaws, such as the lack of seller / buyer protection, fraud and scalability. <br><br>  This cryptocurrency project is not based on the blockchain, but on the DAG structure, which is similar to IOTA and Nano.  Using this structure, Coti claims to be able to conduct transactions instantly, while charging the lowest interest rates, and at the same time remaining a decentralized system - this will help solve many current problems in the financial sector. <br><br>  These are serious aspirations, yet a small team that uses positive experience, has serious knowledge and the potential to create something truly ambitious.  Coti's payment platform will run on Trustchain‚Äôs proprietary protocol, and will include wallets, payment tools and exchangers. <br>  The project has already been able to attract more than $ 3 million in investments during pre-sales, and is going to raise another $ 27 million during their ICO, which will begin on August 15, 2018. <br><br>  For more information about the Coti project and ICO, visit their website, read the technical documentation, and follow the team blog. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://coti.io/">ICO website</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://coti.io/en/files/COTI-technical-whitepaper.pdf%3Fv%3Dffd102a5018">White book</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://t.me/COTInetwork">Chat with creators</a> <br><br><h3>  ORCA </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9v/qs/ka/9vqskae0vtbl_stkoibabokiw8m.png"><br><br>  The ORCA Alliance Alliance is a public initiative that actively promotes the large-scale use of cryptocurrencies through the ORCA platform.  ORCA, an abbreviation of the English term Open and Managed Cryptocurrency Acceptance, will be the first platform that globally integrates bank and cryptocurrency accounts, as well as being the leader of a cryptocurrency economy.  ORCA will take advantage of the reissued EU Payment Services Directive (PSD2) 1, which authorizes account holders to disclose data, eliminating the role of financial institutions as a controller.  In addition, the ORCA platform is developing an ecosystem of dynamic financial services using its components: the ORCA Application Center, an integrated service for the development of cryptographic services and Quest, the gaming community, which is creating innovations in blockchain technology. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://orcaalliance.eu/ru/">ICO website</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://orcaalliance.eu/docs/ORCA_WP_07.pdf">White book</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://t.me/ORCAalliance">Chat with creators</a> <br><br><h3>  Kryptopal </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1m/jd/r-/1mjdr-gmw9jsgyphkqb6_xsygcm.png"><br><br>  KryptoPal is a blockchain-based platform that can be integrated with many applications around the world to conduct various cryptocurrency transactions. <br><br>  The platform was created by technologists who have been working in the blockchain industry for many years and are well aware of the existing barriers to the widespread adoption and global adoption of cryptocurrencies. <br><br>  KryptoPal is designed to ensure technology is the key to empowerment and prosperity.
