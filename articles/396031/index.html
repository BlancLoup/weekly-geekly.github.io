Opponents of automating everything and everyone in the face of trade unions can be understood: the inevitable reduction of jobs, loss of livelihoods of entire families and other social problems caused by unemployment. <br><br>  Certain concerns also existed in IT circles.  Automation in development, testing, administration puts workers at entire sectors in jeopardy, and even under the condition of an overheated industry market, this state of affairs cannot last forever.

      However, the top management of a number of companies in the sector <a href="https://home.kpmg.com/us/en/home/insights/2016/07/tech-companies-to-significantly-grow-digital-labor-and-human-workforce-over-next-three-years-kpmg-us-tech-ceo-study.html">made</a> an amazing forecast for many: the growth in the number of automated processes will allow some employers to increase the number of jobs in the coming years by 6 percent. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But those who argued that job cuts were inevitably right.  Executives of approximately 75% of technology companies expect a reduction in the number of employees in their organizations, for example, in manufacturing, IT, marketing and sales by 5%.  At the same time, 55% of the 138 executives surveyed believe that, in general, their staff, even with these ‚Äúlosses,‚Äù will increase by 6% over three years. <br><br>  The multidirectional tendency is connected with the fact that automation not only frees up resources in some areas, increasing labor efficiency, but at the same time creates fundamentally new jobs - the interaction of automated production areas with the rest of the company also requires support personnel. <br><br>  An amazing picture emerges: automation, in effect, eliminates low-skilled jobs, but at the same time, by its very existence, creates vacancies for higher-level specialists who will be engaged both in servicing automated processes and acting as a link between innovative and classic production areas . <br><br>  For the sake of business development, the top management uses active recruitment of young employees (in 60% of cases) and conclusion of partnership agreements with other organizations (in 49% of cases). <br><br>  However, innovation has a side effect: with the introduction of automation, management expects a slowdown in the growth rates of its organizations.  Also, certain concerns in the top management environment arise in connection with ensuring an adequate level of cybersecurity and in terms of reputational risks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396031/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396031/</a></p>
