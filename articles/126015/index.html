  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Austria</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The article will be primarily interesting to those who at the moment want to go live and work abroad, or more precisely - to Europe, but he lacks courage and determination.  There are already a lot of tips and examples on the county, so I want to describe with my real example how I managed to achieve this goal in order to dispel doubts that it is so difficult that you don‚Äôt even need to take it.  About why I chose Austria, how I achieved my goal, and if I am satisfied, you will learn from my story. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In fact, it all started with the interest to learn some new foreign language.  The course of commercials for 4, I decided to still enroll in a language school.  Without thinking too long, on the advice of friends as they say, I decided to learn German.  Enrolled in the course "fundamentals of the German language" and rushed.  At the end of the course, I knew only the very minimum of the language and had no experience in communicating, except in a class with a teacher.  Well, okay, I received a certificate (by the way, having no weight anywhere) and scored so to speak.  Study, diploma. <br><br>  After university, I moved to St. Petersburg.  For me it was a dream.  To live in Petersburg.  I, along with friends already living there, began to trade freelance programming and all sorts of multimedia.  Shooting, processing, special effects and so on.  After six months, I have all this already terribly tired, begging and surviving.  I realized that I need to go further.  There was an option to either find a job in Petersburg, or set the bar even higher.  I chose the latter. <br><br><h5>  How to find a job abroad? </h5><br>  Continuing my freelancing activities, I was secret from everyone, at night, donating to sleep, looking for employers abroad.  Thanks to the language course, the vector to search for work was directed towards the German-speaking countries.  Using search engines and German, I found a lot of sites with job opportunities.  On the sites I was looking not only for programming, but also for video shooting and video processing, for sound, and even for 3d graphics, because I had basic knowledge of 3d max, which I received again during freelance work, and so, it was always interesting to render all sorts of texts and simple objects.

      Almost every night I spent an hour or two trying to find and send from one to a maximum of five letters to different employers.  I even compiled my simple addressing system for companies and addresses, where I already sent, where they answered, etc.  Used a simple email.  nameplate for this.  They answered a little from where.  I adjusted my approach along the way.  Changed the text of the appeal to them.  In general, he learned from mistakes.  And after three months of such search work, I finally found a company that replied to me by mail that the vacancy is relevant and that foreigners are quite acceptable for this position. <br><br><h5>  Found a company.  What's next? </h5><br>  <s>And then, a nut.</s>  <s>(c) pie</s> And then the correspondence begins.  We immediately went to chat on Skype.  Of course, in writing.  The language for communication was English.  On the same day I was asked to work remotely, as a trial period.  And the monthly salary was offered in the amount of 1,000 euros.  I cannot describe my emotions.  Joy, pride and other feelings of victory overwhelmed me at that moment.  I ran around the apartment for joy, where I lived in a commune with four more of the same IT people, telling everyone about this news.  From that day on, I quickly started my freelancing job, and began to move away from the common cause.  Colleagues understood me, and this did not create any problems.  I switched to independent content. <br><br>  I had to create a currency account in the savings bank to transfer salaries there.  There were some troubles and anger towards my company, which was often dynamic with a salary, but in the end everything was always decided by a happy end. <br><br><h5>  What kind of work was remote? </h5><br>  I worked in the most simple and popular position in the IT world.  Php + mysql programmer  Verstael design, pulled on joomla, at best, wrote components for non-standard needs.  A manager worked with me in a pair, with whom I was actually the first to communicate.  The guy was German, I am the same age.  We quickly became friends and found a common language.  Sometimes outside working hours, they called up on Skype to chat.  Thanks to him, my conversational (and his, too, English) rose to an unrecognizable level.  Sometimes I asked him to speak German.  Not knowing what I was trying to disassemble speech into words and memorize something, with its help. <br><br>  This work lasted about half a year.  Some day I told my friend, the manager, that in general I want to move to Europe if he could ask the authorities how they look at it.  During this time I have very positively recommended myself, doing my work qualitatively.  And even once he helped the firm out, working 7 days a week on one ‚Äúperishing‚Äù project.  All this gave me serious karma.  The authorities perceived my desire to move very positively. <br><br><h5>  Visa. </h5><br>  The company had 2 jur.  persons in Germany and Austria.  One child, another important.  I was asked if I am not against working in Austria, and not in Germany?  In view of the fact that all programmers and brains are here.  I was in some pleasant shock, because the offer was a little confusing to me.  I didn‚Äôt know anything about Austria at that time.  I got into wikipedia and the map.  When I saw what the city looks like, where I can actually go, what mountains there are and so on, I told myself that this is even cooler than I had planned.  To hell Germany!  Here is my new dream!  I told my colleagues that definitely yes! <br><br>  For a work visa you need a number of documents.  Notarized copies of the copy.  The set is standard (passport, birth certificate, diploma ...).  Gathering everything you need, I sent an express delivery all to the company.  Then they began the process from their side.  After filing all the documents there, we had to wait for the result for about 3 months.  All this time we just continued to work as before. <br><br>  One day I received an email.  A letter from the Austrian Embassy in Moscow.  The letter was similar to the following: Congratulations, the state of Austria gave a positive response to the issue of a working visa of category D for 18 months.  Come to such an address in Moscow for a visa. <br><br>  It was the second time when I could not describe my emotions.  There was nothing more long-awaited and desirable in my life.  In essence, this letter meant the end of my entire plan, which originated in my head, after living half a year in Petersburg.  From the birth of the idea to the final, it took about a year only. <br><br>  I could no longer work on the day I received this news, I informed all my colleagues that I was going offline and flying to you <s>on the wings of love</s> during the week. <br><br><h5>  I am in Austria. </h5><br>  My path was hard, I was traveling by train, and spb - MSK - Vienna.  Terribly long it seemed to me going train.  In fact, 3 days in total.  I didn't want to fly by plane.  Scary and the desire to go and enjoy the trip was stronger.  By train you drive through different countries.  From the capital of Austria, I was still traveling by train to the final city.  The city is located in the south and borders Italy.  And here I am on the spot.  I am met by a female colleague who did all the documents on the visa.  Joy overwhelms me.  Titles. <br><br>  The End. <br><br><h5>  PS </h5><br>  Answering the last unresolved question, whether I am satisfied, I will answer shortly: yes! Damn it.  I have lived abroad for a year and a half.  And already used to everything.  The local language is almost like a native.  I like the Austrian dialects of the German language very much, therefore I teach them, and not German itself. <br><br><h6>  Achieve your goals.  Nothing is impossible. </h6><br>  More interesting details, facts, prices and similar information about living and working in Austria in pictures, and not only - I hope coming soon.  I want to believe that my algorithm for achieving the goal will benefit someone. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126015/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126015/</a></p>
