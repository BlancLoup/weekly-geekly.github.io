  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A few notes about the construction of the show</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  First, let's agree on something.  I take online projects like any other show.  Of course there is some difference between the TV program and the blog, but the similarities are much greater than the differences.  For the same reason, my dictionary consists mainly of simple words not related to the Internet.  Make analogies, you will learn the same thing that I know.  Yes, and anticipating the question "where did I come from so clever" - I was long ago.  And the number of shows that I directed exceeded two dozen.  And the number of shows that I watched closely - I think for two hundred. <br><br>  0. There are different ways to measure the success of a show, but for each show the measure of success is one.  For a blog, this is attendance; for an online store, the merchantability of a product; for a quiz show, the number of people who do not run to the kitchen during advertising.  So, <strong>determine the measure of success of your show, watch him, measure it</strong> .  Only in this way you will learn to understand what your actions lead to what results. <br><br>  1. The most difficult advice, especially for those who have already started their show.  <strong>It is very important to understand what and why you are doing</strong> .  How strange it is not at all obvious.  Suppose you run a blog about flying saucers.  Answer your questions: why are you doing this?  What is the ultimate goal of the show?  who is your audience.  If the answers are not obvious to you - the show is doomed to failure.

      2. <strong>Watch the audience, but do not indulge it.</strong>  A typical mistake of many shows is to listen to every feedback of the viewer, to every criticism from the side.  Do not forget, most of your viewers are amateurs in the show, they do not know what you know.  If you do not tolerate applied psychology, try to simply ignore criticism, use only positive feedback.  There are two reasons to do exactly this: firstly, the viewer, a satisfied show is very lazy and will not climb to call-write something about how he liked it.  If he wrote you ‚Äúit was awesome !! 11‚Äù - it means it was really cool, think about it.  Secondly, people whose criticism deserves respect and consideration are rarely free, and you already know these people and can count them on your fingers.  I hope one hand. <br><br>  3. <strong>Play with the audience, she loves it</strong> .  This advice is not for everyone, but for the obvious majority of the show.  ‚ÄúScandals, intrigues, investigations‚Äù is one of the best ways to attract new people.  God forbid you to confuse "play" with "flirt". <br><br>  4. If you are an active participant in the show - <strong>choose an image for yourself, describe it and stick to it to the end, whatever the cost</strong> .  Viewers do not attend your show to see how you have changed.  Unless, of course, your show is about how you change. <br><br>  5. Never <strong>publicly disclose all the secrets of your show</strong> .  Magic, mystery, riddle, call it what you want - but the show without it turns into a farce, and sometimes minced. <br><br>  Only having recorded all this as if I were in the spirit, I understood that all good shows obey the rule of serials.  There are only three of these rules: <br><br>  1. There is an end-to-end storyline that usually fits in a couple of sentences.  During the entire series, this storyline and revealed <br><br>  2. Each series should end approximately in the same place where it began.  All the main characters move from series to series unchanged. <br><br>  3. One of the 12 episodes must violate rule 2 in order to follow rule 1. <br><br>  I think on this today you can put a semicolon.  If you have fresh thoughts about this - lay out.  And God forbid, I will write more. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30716/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30716/</a></p>
