Now the teacher has problems, not her student. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/79d/3bc/2da/79d3bc2da66fa1b9452e265df3a225d1.png" width="600" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Secondary school teacher Lee Ann Arthur (Leigh Anne Arthur) taught <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">Mechatronics</a> - a field of science and technology based on the combination of fine mechanics with electronic, electrical and computer components.  She said that she had left the phone on the table for a few minutes - she went to the hall of the school to follow the order.  A sixteen-year-old student unlocked a phone that was not password-protected and found photos in which the teacher was partially undressed.  Photos of the woman made on Valentine's Day for her husband, but forgot to remove. <br><br>  The student photographed the screen of the smartphone with one of these photos and sent it to his peers.  And the teacher said: "Your day of reckoning is nearing!"

      For these actions, the guy <a href="http://www.thestate.com/news/state/article63205002.html">will not be punished</a> .  Guilty believe the teacher, because the phone was not blocked.  ‚ÄúI think we have the right to privacy, but when we take unacceptable photos or create other information, we must make sure that they remain intact,‚Äù says a government official. <br><br>  The teacher herself forgave the student: "He is only 16. We all make stupid decisions at 16 years old."  Moral: block the smartphone! <br><br>  In this case, for a photo of a former girlfriend or boyfriend, and posted on porn sites, you can <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/248952/">get in the UK two years in prison</a> .  The 16-year-old schoolboy in February 2015 became the youngest person convicted of ‚Äúporn from revenge‚Äù.  He is now 17 years old.  When he was 14, for ¬£ 10 he sold his photos of his ex-15-year-old girlfriend to friends.  He had a total of 170 photos.  For this, the student and one of his friends received 12 months of correctional labor. <br><br>  And this student was lucky.  In Russia, after the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/269818/">‚Äú10 years for hentai‚Äù</a> comes into force, the punishment will be more severe - up to ten years.  In this case, materials or objects with pornographic images of minors will even be recognized as images of an adult person depicting a minor. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/391139/">https://habr.com/ru/post/391139/</a></p>
