Since restrictions on the number of domains, databases, and in general, the inability to install any software is not good. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"

      The company was advised by an acquaintance (McHost.ru was chosen), the price tag looked more than attractive (http://mchost.ru/vps/), and for testing we purchased the first VPS-1 tariff, the staff kindly helped us transfer the sites themselves data.  After that we rewrote the DNS server and everything seemed to work successfully.  We immediately paid the bill for six months in advance, and were glad that we finally collected all our projects under one wing. <br><br>  At once I will say that I am not a professional in the field of Unix-systems, therefore the control panel was immediately ordered (ISP Manager) <br>  The problems began immediately after we re-created our mailboxes on the new hosting.  Spam crashed 200 letters a day. <br>  To our question about the technical support service, about how to prevent this invasion, we were told that setting up the VPS is our sole prerogative, and any gestures of administrators - for some money.  Those.  ‚ÄúMoving‚Äù to the VPS of this company you need to be prepared for the fact that spam will be immediately.  But God be with him.  Everyone has their own bread. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The spam filter was installed (if I‚Äôm not mistaken, it was spamassasin), and spam emails began to be marked as [SPAM].  Money from the account has been withdrawn. <br>  everything would be fine, but after that some kind of frenzy began - our domains just took off 3 times a day, i.e.  were not available.  At the same time the server itself worked quite well.  Technical support, especially without understanding the reasons, just overloaded the server. <br><br>  I will not lay out all correspondence with technical support, for almost a week now I have been writing letters to them every day asking them to sort out the situation and take any measures.  Different specialists answer, but the general tendency is approximately the following: you bought a VPS, you are with it and figure it out, the service for checking the status of the server is again paid, and best of all go to the next tariff (it is 2 times more expensive).  But there are no guarantees that everything will be fine on the next tariff - either. <br><br>  It turns out that by ordering the server with the default settings + the spam filter installed by the tech support specialists, I received an unstable server. <br><br>  At the moment, they are trying to convince me that the server capacity at the first tariff is not enough to keep 6 simple sites + filter about 300 emails per day.  And in order to understand exactly what is happening with the server, I have to deposit the money again. <br>  To my questions why they didn‚Äôt warn about this initially, before installing the spam filter, I didn‚Äôt get an answer.  As far as I know, there are others. <br><br>  Friends, I hope for your advice.  How normal is this situation? <br>  Or do I want too much? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/42850/">https://habr.com/ru/post/42850/</a></p>
