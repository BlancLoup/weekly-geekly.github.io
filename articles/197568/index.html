There is no talk about cartoons yet - we have familial myopia, and somehow I don‚Äôt want to teach a child to regular visual stress from one and a half years.  So, at first he listened to ‚ÄúThe Bremen Town Musicians‚Äù and other similar recordings from my Samsung Galaxy S4.  In the end, I found myself without a cheap Flip Cover - a small pest gnawed at it to such an extent that it had to be changed.  And also - to get from his mom: they say, you drag your smartphone anywhere, it's dirty, God forbid the child will catch the infection.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  I had to think about how to make everyone happy at once - the child, his mother, and the Galaxy S4, who probably wants to live safe and sound for at least another six months (before the announcement of the Galaxy S5 or something else comparable in function "charge") . <br><br>  After some thought, I came to the following conclusion: the Bluetooth speaker is an ideal option for such situations.  She has several advantages.  The most important of them is that the phone can be put, for example, on a window sill (or even completely carried to another room), and the sound will be transmitted to the speaker through the air.  Yes, her child can break too.  But such an accessory costs no more than 2 thousand rubles, and a smartphone (in my case) is well over 20. So the speakers in which case is not a pity, but on the phone I will grieve in full. <br><br>  In short, I attended to the choice of this column.  I remember once I met a bright red Viks VR100 recorder - just my favorite.  According to the characteristics, this model did not fit me, but the brand name in my head was postponed.  Choosing a column, I paid attention to the Viks VS-BT10 - purely by chance, remembering that the recorder.  I looked closely - in principle, suitable.  Analogs from other brands are about the same in capabilities and cost the same.  At the same time, Viks VS-BT10 is also red, which personally pleased me.  But ... The wife, alas, ah, insisted on the silver version - they say, "he will be less annoying to the child."  Well, if so ... <br><br>  I gave 1 700 rubles and got just such a thing: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/a1e/e72/37e/a1ee7237e1a82ab949948637fe0aacc3.jpg"><br><br>  I will say right away that I decided to ‚Äútackle‚Äù my child‚Äôs problem - the tales from the phone via Bluetooth are played perfectly, everyone is happy.  At first, the child regularly pressed the control buttons on the upper edge of the column, which transferred it to another mode and turned off the music.  But then it came to his son that the sound disappears exactly after pressing, and now he just turns the column in his hands and occasionally throws it into the wall.  Viks VS-BT10 is suffering and is not going to die. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/783/7b3/79e/7837b379e065419a379f583bdffa7730.jpg"><br>  <i>Control keys on the top face</i> <br><br>  In the meantime, it turned out that some of the features of the Viks VS-BT10 are interesting for me personally.  I'll tell you the points.  The first is the ability to play music from memory cards as well.  I was surprised to find that 64 GB microSD was recognized by the device without any problems - I just read the reviews on Yandex.Market and on forums when choosing a column that similar gadgets often refuse to work with 16 GB flash drives.  Not to mention 32 and 64. <br><br>  So, the volume of Viks VS-BT10 is enough for a company of 5-6 people.  You can take a picnic, and you can hoist it in the center of the table.  Sound quality ... Well, it's clear that this is not Bang &amp; Olufsen.  Perhaps, personally for myself, I would take something more expensive and high-quality, although, in principle, the unit under consideration for gatherings "for beer" also fit.  For attacks on nature, it is the memory card that is preferable: a Bluetooth connection is noticeably stronger than the speaker itself and the telephone.  (I emphasize that for small children there is only Bluetooth: they can pick out the card from the speaker and swallow it. So it‚Äôs not worth the risk.) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/1f6/d6a/dd2/1f6d6add246992ba14ef260c8a126cae.jpg"><br><br>  Here I will add that Viks VS-BT10 can be connected via cable to any gadgets with a 3.5 mm jack - the corresponding cable is included in the package.  There is also a headphone jack - for listening to music in splendid isolation. <br><br>  The second point is the ability to work as a speakerphone system, which is provided by Bluetooth support and a built-in microphone.  You click on the big button in the center of the top panel - and that‚Äôs it, the challenge is accepted.  Moreover, the lower part of the Viks VS-BT10 is made of a little sticky rubber, so that the column can be quite safely placed in the car.  I tried, you can use.  Of course, this is such a "frill of hopelessness", and it is better to purchase a specialized solution, and yet - maybe someone will come in handy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/75a/ed5/4b6/75aed54b6b0884014bef073a1bdf2654.jpg"><br><br>  The third point is the radio.  It works average, more noise than it works.  But if you connect any cable (included 3.5 mm / 3.5 mm and miniUSB / USB), the quality rises to an acceptable level.  Just the lace starts to act as an antenna. <br><br>  Well, a few words about autonomy.  Hours 3-4 Viks VS-BT10 plays.  This is if with Bluetooth.  If the music is on a memory card, the device will last for 5 hours. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/ac2/d65/016/ac2d6501651c8931cda3de5c106218c8.jpg"><br><br>  It is clear that Viks VS-BT10 is a simple gadget and is hardly very interesting in itself.  Well, the column and the column - nothing special.  But this post should not be taken as a review of the e-trinket, but as a kind of life hacking - at least, I personally managed to solve a serious problem with the help of this column.  Everyone is happy, fairy tales fly "through the air", SGS4 is sleeping peacefully. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/197568/">https://habr.com/ru/post/197568/</a></p>
