Do you know how to make money yourself?</font> </h2><br>  Learning to work for yourself is not easy, especially if you are accustomed to get paid for your work at the end of each month.  It will take a long time until you get rid of it.

      Only you yourself can take care of yourself - after your dismissal, there will be no one to pay you regularly.  This is probably the hardest thing to think about in advance. <br><br>  You will make a big mistake if you quit your job without having the slightest idea how to make money yourself. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">2. Salary is the biggest temptation</font> </h2><br>  A regular salary gives you freedom and confidence.  We do not worry about how to make money - no need to look for customers, fight with competitors, advertise new products.  Salary is the biggest enemy of new ideas, creativity and enthusiasm.  It's so convenient to regularly receive money at the end of the month, without worrying about anything.  Not to succumb to this temptation and not to rest on our laurels is real art. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">3. Get comfortable with failures.</font> </h2><br>  Perhaps, before leaving work, you never had to experience serious failures in life.  How to treat them?  How <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/8-osnovnyx-oshibok-kotorye-dopuskayut-lyudi-pri-izuchenii-inostrannogo-yazyka/">to cope with errors and failures</a> ?  There may be big problems if you start to deal with these issues after the dismissal. <br><br>  In order to avoid these problems in the future, you need to try to calmly perceive the failures and possible mistakes.  To learn this should be before leaving work - for safety net.  Experiment, take chances and be courageous.  Try to do what everyone else is afraid to tackle. <br><br>  In any case, you risk nothing, because you were already going to quit your job. <br><br>  It will take a long time before you stop experiencing the fear of failure.  But you don‚Äôt have to start getting used to them when you are on the edge of the abyss - not having a job.  Another setback - and you fall into the abyss.  Many people go this way.  Some of them remain forever in this abyss, while others return to where they left from - to their former position. <br><br>  If you have never had real failures and disappointments, try to test them, while the end of the abyss is still far away - before dismissal from work. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">4. Learn to communicate with people on the web.</font> </h2><br>  When you have a regular office job, you rarely feel the need to <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/socialnye-seti-idealnyj-sposob-praktikovatsya-v-inostrannom-yazyke/">communicate with people on social networks</a> .  Every day, you again and again go to dinner with the same people, and only occasionally meet someone outside of your department. <br><br>  Many begin to learn about social networks only after leaving work.  Although it is much easier to do before being fired.  When you have a job, it's easier for you to tell people what you are doing, and the name of a reputable company in which you work will raise your status.  It is very difficult to earn trust, if there is no work - it is impossible to talk about what is not. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">5. The importance of communication</font> </h2><br>  Access to communication is the value of the 21st century.  If you have your own social circle and people listen to you, then you can make contact with any person.  If you do not have an audience or you cannot influence it, you are the loser.  Do not believe those who claim that they can quickly establish contact with a person only with the help of a witty SMS message or comment in social networks. <br><br>  Nothing can be more important than communication.  And this will help you worldwide network.  Communicating with people, you can get from them what you want.  Work on creating and expanding your audience before you quit your job. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">6. No one will know about you by the wave of a magic wand.</font> </h2><br>  No one will know about you if you don‚Äôt put effort into it.  It doesn‚Äôt matter how good a specialist you are or how great you are doing your job.  Even many well-known <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/znanie-inostrannyx-yazykov-i-uspeshnost-est-li-svyaz/">artists had to use all their abilities</a> and send their demos to hundreds of recording studios or upload hundreds of videos to YouTube before they learned about them. <br><br>  This all concerns the issue of demonstrating your capabilities and creating your own audience.  But dreams will remain dreams, if you do not put any effort.  By the way, for this it is not necessary to give up work. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">7. Do not be afraid of repetitions.</font> </h2><br>  The more often you do the same work, the better you do it.  It seems, it is simple - as all ingenious.  However, it takes a lot of time for many to figure it out.  Repetition gives you the opportunity to hone your skills.  As a result, over time, you have less time to work, and you can quickly solve all the problems and issues that arise. <br><br>  For example, a journalist may often ask himself questions.  Is the article well written enough?  When is it better to publish it?  Was it worth it at all to write about it?  But if he writes a lot every day, he has no time to think about these useless things - he just does his job. <br><br>  Do your favorite thing and do not be distracted by useless moments - it is better to spend your energy on something really worthwhile. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">8. Perseverance is not all that is needed for success.</font> </h2><br>  The real secret of success is the absence of other options.  If you do not have a choice, you will need to do everything to achieve your goal. <br><br>  You will have to act decisively and do things that you would not have done before.  You need to succeed, no matter what it costs, because you have no other choice.  It is a pity that many understand it too late.  But how many bridges could have been burned before, and not knocking on many closed doors. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">9. There is no quick success.</font> </h2> <br>  There are interesting stories about instant success, and there are real ones about how they really succeed.  About the first you can read online - they all talk about dreams come true. <br><br>  But there are real stories, for example, about AirBnB - an American company that rents private housing around the world.  The founders of this company traveled throughout the United States, visiting apartment owners.  They talked with each individually and urged them to rent housing.  Several years passed before these people agreed - they also needed to rent a house during the trip. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">10. Find ‚Äúyour‚Äù people to chat online.</font> </h2><br>  There are recommendations for online communication - it is advised to communicate with a group of about five people.  This advice does not seem to be entirely helpful.  Indeed, in this case, all witty people would quickly lose their intelligence. <br><br>  Some need some time to figure it out.  Try to minimize all types of content that you constantly view - blogs, posts, podcasts, etc., and focus on only a few, the most useful and important for you.  This will avoid the mass of conflicting advice and unnecessary information, which only hinders your development and does not provide a clear understanding of many things. <br><br>  These are only 10 of those many things that you need to think about before leaving.  Now, before you quit your job, try to look at the situation from the other side. <br><br>  PS We recommend another useful article on the work on oneself - <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/kak-izlechitsya-ot-bolezni-otkladyvaniya-na-potom-pri-izuchenii-yazykov-ili-prokrastinacii-boj/">How to recover from the disease of ‚Äúpostponing for later‚Äù when learning languages, or ‚ÄúProcrastination - fight‚Äù</a> . <br><br>  The author of the translation is Vyacheslav Davidenko, the founder of the <a href="http://testutor.com/">TESTutor</a> company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298578/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298578/</a></p>
