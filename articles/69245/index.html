    </i>  <i>We are also interested in recovery within at least our space, room, room.</i>  <i>It is established that some plants can reduce the number of pathogens in the air by 70-80%.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>So, what can we improve with what plants?</i>  <i>I want to share the information found in the spaces of the Runet and drawn from the lectures of A. Rabinovich, professor of botany, head.</i>  <i>laboratory of phytoncidal and aromatic plants VILAR.</i> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  A healthy microclimate can be maintained only by specially selected flowers.  Depending on the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe room, at least 5 plants with a height of at least half a meter are selected. <br><br>  Perhaps the most important quality of plants is the ability to release oxygen.  If there is not enough oxygen in the room, fatigue and fatigue are guaranteed.  How should the content of this gas, which is necessary for life, be increased by the use of <b>sansevieria</b> , or, in common parlance, the earth tail?  Especially productive it works in the daytime.  And the famous <b>coffee tree</b> perfectly ionizes the air.  Being near him you will get a charge of cheerfulness. <br><br>  <b>Ivy</b> , various types of <b>dieffenbachy</b> , <b>philodendron</b> and ordinary <b>aloe</b> do quite well with toxins. <br><br>  The house also needs plants - collectors of dust, especially valuable is their property to accumulate microscopic dust, from which even a vacuum cleaner will not save.  She, by the way, the most harmful.  <b>Spruce</b> and <b>pine</b> will cope with such dust. <br><br>  Want to have air in the house like in the mountains?  Then you will need <b>conifers</b> , known for their ability to ionize the air.  Such air is known to treat some diseases.  Negative ions are very useful for diabetics, people with a weak vascular system and those who suffer from frequent headaches.  And still negative ions which emit coniferous plants, can neutralize harmful effects of household appliances creating electromagnetic fields. <br><br>  One of the biggest problems of big cities is noise.  With it, over time, even in an iron man, the nervous system can loosen.  But it‚Äôs difficult to hide from the noise in our apartments, but you can close.  The best sound absorbers are <b>cypress</b> and <b>juniper</b> .  True, they will have to force the entire window, down to the window, but the reduction of street sounds to 30% will be guaranteed. <br><br>  The spread of spores of fungi of various species is well combated by <b>prickly pears</b> , as well as plants with a bactericidal effect, including <b>aloe</b> <b>vera</b> and <b>krasulla</b> .  It is known that the latter can reduce the number of molds by 7 times. <br><br>  Thanks to the plants, we can create a healthy microclimate.  Moreover, it is relatively cheap and at the same time truly environmentally friendly. <br><br>  What creates a feeling of comfort, grooming and comfort in the room?  First of all - the absence of dust.  Dancing in the sunbeam microscopic dust particles - a source of allergies and asthma.  They never settle to the surface of furniture or the floor; even a washing vacuum cleaner cannot cope with them.  Moisture-loving plants with wide, large leaves, primarily <b>spathiphyllum,</b> will help you.  Its dark glossy leaves like a magnet attract airborne dust.  Put the plant pot in a wide pan filled with wet claydite: this will create the humidity of the air that is necessary for him and you, which is detrimental to dry dust.  The weekly warm shower this inhabitant of the Amazonian swamps will also be gratefully received.  Similar capabilities are possessed by <b>ktenanta</b> , <b>kalatei</b> and <b>arrowroot</b> .  All of these plants are kept in spacious pots, light peaty soil, with good lighting and room temperature. <br><br>  Room air requires cleaning and from a variety of chemical compounds.  <b>Sanitary three-band sanitier</b> will successfully cope with hydrocarbon chloride compounds, abundantly released by modern plastics.  Particularly good is its variety <b>Sansovieria Laurentii</b> with leaves bordered with yellow stripes.  This is really a plant for the lazy: it grows well both in the light and in conditions of strong shadow.  Do not be too upset even if it is not watered for a week or two.  True, abundant watering in the summer and a cool, light, semi-dry wintering will respond in spring with a brush of nondescript greenish flowers with a delicate exquisite aroma that fills the entire apartment. <br><br>  The kitchen air saturated with carbon dioxide will be cleaned by <b>chlorophytum crested</b> , <b>hoya fleshy</b> ( <b>wax ivy</b> ), <b>rhombic roetstissus</b> .  The last two types are better placed on the window, and chlorophytum is possible in the depth of the room.  Located next to the desk in the office, it will saturate the air with oxygen and increase your efficiency.  The same task will be successfully fulfilled by the <b>Chinese hibiscus</b> , only the place he needs to choose the sunniest. <br><br>  Formaldehyde secreted from chipboard products neutralizes <b>dracaenes</b> , <b>cordilins</b> , <b>yuccas</b> and <b>philodendrons</b> .  These are quite large plants that require abundant watering in the summer and fertilizing.  In winter, they are kept in cool and drier conditions (with the exception of philodendrons).  They all love spraying with warm boiled water.  Dragonflies, yuccas and cordys are planted in large floor pots, and philodendrons can be grown as ampelae or put up through an artificial palm fiber trunk. <br><br>  Surely you will like it if the room always has the fresh smell of <b>lemon</b> or <b>orange</b> .  Citrus leaves secrete essential oils that have antispasmodic and antiseptic effects, and elegant porcelain-white flowers fill the room with a wonderful aroma.  By the way, the leaves of <b>Pelargonium fragrant</b> have a characteristic lemon smell. <br><br>  One of the most mysterious and exotic plants, the <b>orchid</b> , absorbs harmful substances with its air roots. <br><br>  <b>Chlorophytum</b> is considered the most effective in combating viruses with a plant.  <b>Asparagus</b> also has a good phytoncid property (it reduces the number of harmful creatures by a factor of 2), <b>monstera</b> , <b>spurge</b> and <b>krasulla</b> .  The latter reduces the number of germs in 3 times - no less!  These plants include some inhabitants of the Mediterranean subtropics: <b>ordinary myrtle</b> , <b>laurel</b> , <b>lavender</b> , <b>rosemary</b> .  One and a half square meters of myrtle leaves kill half of the pathogens in an area of ‚Äã‚Äãup to 100 cubic meters.  The fragrant leaves of myrtle cause a feeling of happiness and peace (it is not for nothing that in the Mediterranean countries it is given to the newlyweds).  Laurel has an antispasmodic effect (remember laurel wreaths on the heads of ancient Greek heroes).  Lavender is a good antiseptic.  Rosemary prevents the development of asthma and effectively treats bronchitis.  To get rid of coughing episodes you can chew on the leaves of <b>Murayi</b> . <br><br>  There are also a group of plants that kill viruses.  Ideal for this purpose are <b>eucalyptus</b> <b>globules</b> , <b>rod-shaped</b> and <b>globus</b> .  And if you don't like eucalyptus trees, put a myrtle or rosemary in the house. <br><br>  Health and good luck! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/69245/">https://habr.com/ru/post/69245/</a></p>
