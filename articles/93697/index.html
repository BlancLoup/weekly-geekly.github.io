  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Portal: Prelude - open your brain on the eve of the release of Portal 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When Portal came out, freshly-formed fans of the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe game were indignant about the ease and short duration of the passage. <br>  And on October 10, 2008, an amateur mod came out - Portal: Prelude. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a63/578/3db/a635783db62dc71762390a18c95572cb.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In fact, the mod was made by one person - Nicolas Grivitom.  He was helped by 2 more people, but they mostly limited themselves to a couple of tips and drawing several textures. <br>  In general, fashion are different - long, but tedious.  Short but hardcore.  Or just stupid and tedious.  So, P: P is more long-term (compared to orininal) and very hardcore.  There is no longer just logic, but also reaction. <br>  If you,% username%, played Portal and played difficult cards 25 times, then you can try to get through. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Prelude </h4><br>  Someone may say that this is never a modification, but simply a redesign of the cards of an existing Portal.  So, it is enough to play the first one (!) Level in order to understand that this is far from the case.

That's because P: P is a prequel to the original story.  Events unfold on the eve of the launch of the aforementioned <s>Shaitan</s> machine, the consequences of which we already know. <br><br><img src="http://games.aplus.by/uploads/posts/2008-10/1223830736_portal-prelude.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the third, to lead the actions of Abby (it is not clear how she was in the laboratories) there will be <s>shifted</s> technically interested scientists. <br><br><img src="http://s001.radikal.ru/i194/1002/d4/c63dcb4033f7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As in the case with GLaDOS, listening to their skirmishes is a pleasure.  Without the slightest hesitation, we are told that our heroine is not the first in Aperture Science, and the mortality rate is above average.  The voice was made using a speech synthesizer, and we must pay tribute to the creator - the voices sound very convincing. <br><br><h4>  Gameplay </h4><br>  The game has 19 test chambers and, again, the backyard laboratories.  Tasks can be divided into two types: <br><ul><li>  You know what to do, but you have no idea how. </li><li>  You have no idea what to do or how </li></ul><br>  In addition, new ‚Äúaggravating circumstances‚Äù appeared in the game: curved gravity, disintegration fields and other amenities. <br>  Unlike Portal, camera passing is not always unambiguous.  There are alternative methods for completing a level.  In addition, now the doors open not only after the completion of the task, but also from being near the door (but you should not think that it is so easy to do). <br><br><h4>  Contacting Portal </h4><br>  Abby will visit the cells, which later will be Chell.  However, the passage of these tests is an order of magnitude more complicated than the original. <br>  In addition, in the cameras, we will meet with our favorite character in the second plan: Weighted Companion Cargo Cube <br><br><img src="http://otakutrap.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/000074.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In principle, no fundamental changes in the possibilities are expected: the same gray walls, red buttons and so on.  Portals again only 2. And the problems are basically similar: quickly fall into the orange hole and quickly fly out of the blue.  Another thing is that in the course of the flight it is necessary to transfer portals more than once, for which we need a sickly dexterity. <br><br><h4>  GLaDOS </h4><br>  Many expected R: R of the epic GLaDOS launch scene, and the developer did not let him down: the heroine Abby would have to be present, and even gobbled up from a machine that had gone crazy, and even install an unfinished module of ‚Äúmoral principles‚Äù in it.  Apparently, Nicolas used the idea that it‚Äôs harder to create than to fall apart =) <br><br>  Spoiler spoiler: <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/rxCt-03LcUE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhi0-_nBqXKi618YHcCGNkjZ9LuOyQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  As a background, advanced levels are included in the game (to be honest, I haven‚Äôt tried them yet) <br><br><h4>  Characteristic dates </h4><br>  Start of development - January 2008.  Initially developed a set of cards that are not related to the plot. <br>  Release date - October 10, 2008.  It was chosen not by chance, but dedicated to the anniversary of the release of the Orange Box of Orange <s>Boxes</s> . <br>  Announcement Portal 2 - March 5, 2010.  The game was announced as the official prequel to Portal.  In an interview, Nicolas said that, apparently, was the only person on Earth who was not happy about this fact.  However, now we know that the events of the second part will take place several hundred years after the end of the first. <br><br>  If interested, you can visit the <a href="http://www.portalprelude.com/">site of the game.</a> <br>  And yet, knowing that it is useful: the <a href="http://www.portalprelude.com/walkthrough.php">official (but not the only possible) passage.</a> <br><br><h4>  The cake is true </h4><br>  The cake is true </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93697/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93697/</a></p>
