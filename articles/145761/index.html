  <section class="page js-page"><h1>TechEd 2012 North America: What I Wore from Day One</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img align="left" src="http://northamerica.msteched.com/p/tena2011/resources/techEdHeaderLogo.jpg" alt="image">  It so happened that the first day of TechEd 2012 North America, was largely devoted to server technologies.  Many people, including Ben Rubinstein, editor of SearchWindowsServer.com: <a href="http://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/windows-server/lessons-learned-from-teched-2012-day-1/">itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/windows-server/lessons-learned-from-teched-2012-day-1, took a look</a> at what was interesting on the first day.  Here is the translation of his message from the conference. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  On TechEd, we constantly find out something ... However, the expected coincides with the actual.  On the first day in Orlando, Florida, we learned a lot of new things, and not only about the release of the new Windows Intuite, CTP2 System Center 2012 SP1 and Hyper-V 2012 (Release Candidate), but also about many other things. <br>  Here are just some fun moments: <br>  <b>1. Incredible speed.</b>  Microsoft Virtualization Program Manager Jeff Woolsey attracted the most attention by transferring a 10-gigabyte file in ten seconds using Windows Server 2012 and Hyper-V.  The conference participants were amazed;  and most of the time, Jeff answered questions about Hyper-V. <br>  <b>2. Funny Mark Russinovich</b> (which, by the way, is expected at TechEd 2012 Russia in November - ed.).  His part of the presentation on Windows Azure constantly spawned laughter from the audience.  For example, ‚ÄúNo, we were not hacked;  Azure does support Linux as a guest operating system. ‚Äù <br>  <b>3. Crowdsourcing in real time is dangerous.</b>  Scott Guthrie created the Azure web application during the presentation and shared the mailbox with the audience.  At the same time, everything was broadcast on the big screen, where the ‚Äúspecial‚Äù notes appeared, from mocking SQL injection to the frank question ‚ÄúWho farted?‚Äù. <br>  <b>4. Apple is ok.</b>  A number of demonstrations took place on iPhones, along with other devices.  It is quite logical, taking into account the number of MacBooks and iPads from the audience. <br>  <b>5. More and more Powershell.</b>  The fact that Powershell is getting more and more attention on Microsoft systems is not new.  However, adding the second section of ‚ÄúPowerShell Crash Course‚Äù TechEd under the leadership of Don Jones and Jeffrey Snover says that IT specialists are actually beginning to understand that ignorance of Powershell can affect their careers. <br>  <b>6. People are unhappy with the tests.</b>  Not everyone understands how (and why) Microsoft has changed its certification program.  In the meantime, it was possible to observe how a huge number of people tried to pass all sorts of tests on the first day - in order to fill their resume with a similar fact. <br>  <b>7. Twitter is hard.</b>  The section ‚ÄúSocial Media for Business‚Äù discussed the pros and cons of supporting social media activities from an IT perspective.  The most important insight is the expansion of social media compared to the transition from single-core to multi-core processors. <br>  <b>8. "It is impossible to attract too much attention."</b>  Draws, card tricks, a guy on a unicycle and much more - this year, vendors went to all possible tricks to attract more visitors to their stands. <br><br>  And after all this, I would like to know about the official release dates of Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8 ... <br><br>  About myself, add that on add that on the 11th there was a rather interesting report on <a href="http://northamerica.msteched.com/topic/details/2012/SIA207">Dynamic Access Control</a> from Gunjan Jain, Nir Ben Zvi.  Detailed information about the innovations, we will consider in the near future in the new post about the audit system file server in Windows Server 2012. </div>
