Different: beautiful and not very, with a ‚Äúwarm tube sound‚Äù and rattling, in general, it would seem, everything has already been invented and written about it.  But these two pairs of ‚Äúears‚Äù pleased me not so much with their sound, but rather with design and comfort. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/ca5b0300/bb1330f5/bc4b5f1e/9bc6ebc6.jpg"><br><br>  Well, yes, I'm telling you, because it's better to see 1 time than to read 100 times.

    <h4>  Fischer Audio Lyra </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/0871d46f/4e7e4ac4/adbdc065/01fb4ed2.png"><br><br>  They came here in such packaging, in which besides them there was only an instruction.  Well, what else do you need for headphones of this class? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/b36958ca/5e0be9a0/ae18394d/e1aaeb63.jpg"><br><br>  Let's go directly to the headphones themselves. <br><br><h4>  Design and comfort </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/efd5a853/53713478/720a6b66/f6956285.jpg"><br><br>  Black and red stylish headphones, on the speakers there are beautiful curly reliefs through which the red color shines through, and also the rims are made red. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/fb1439dc/d3cf7de7/e9a91d83/ceb6f35b.jpg"><br><br>  From the side of the speaker - a soft non-removable ambyushura that does not fully cover the ear, but at the same time, lies very comfortably on it. And through the mesh, in principle, you can see even the metal membrane itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/bf0985a4/ae47407b/d748511e/7038fdbf.jpg"><br><br>  The handle is made of metal, which again sends us to the legendary Koss Porta Pro, but it seems to me that these two models are absolutely different.  And here it is covered with plastic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/827862e7/b6cf713b/cc5ffca0/83085139.jpg"><br><br>  Headphones sit comfortably on the head, do not press, wore them for 6 hours, no discomfort.  The speakers bend in several directions, so that they quickly adapt to your ears. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/d4e20e88/86fd7c3c/b7f75e9b/8c299d89.jpg"><br><br>  As for the design drawbacks, the 3.5mm plug is a bit clumsy.  Of course, I wanted something more stylized, perhaps, smooth and with red inserts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/fe1d0936/5f018420/589e158a/2f95d280.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Sound </h4><br><br>  Of course, this is not a ‚Äútube‚Äù sound; this is not required.  The main thing is that the sound quality (compared with headphones for 100 rubles), but not too loud, no bass that beat in the ears.  All at the level of standard headphones, you can listen.  They are suitable for games, watching movies.  In order to hear the bass or enjoy the high quality of the remix of Tchaikovsky, you have to buy something more powerful.  These are earphones for a player, to listen on the way, to abstract from an external world. <br><br>  In principle, the sound is satisfactory, at 3+.  That is, it is possible and even pleasant to listen, nothing prevents, but I can‚Äôt say that this is direct ‚ÄúWOW!‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  Price </h4><br>  Price around 600-700r., I think that a great price for a cool style, comfortable fit and good sound for 4-. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br><br>  <u>pros</u> <br>  + Style <br>  + Comfort <br>  + Mighty sound <br><br>  <u>Minuses</u> <br>  - Ugly plug <br>  - Noise at maximum volume <br><br>  In general - cool headphones.  Podoyutut styligam, lovers of several ancient ornaments.  They sit well on their heads, they don‚Äôt put pressure on their ears, what else is needed?  As for the sound and price, they are quite balanced.  Headphones are designed to just listen to music, not for a DJ and not for recording.  And the rest - they are very good. <br><br>  But let's not go in for a long time and move on to another ‚Äúfashionable thing.‚Äù <br><br><h4>  Fischer audio draco </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/f1863e85/247dcf94/df78679c/564d4ba1.jpg"><br><br>  For some reason, I liked these headphones more.  Firstly, they are a little more massive in size, and secondly, they fit more closely to the ear and almost completely encircle it, well, and the rest is a bit later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/0041b8c6/326edd33/db25d6e9/1d9a37ce.png"><br><br>  Here they had such a box: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/9d1d83ec/355a7194/4200fd88/7ab329a0.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Comfort and design </h4><br><br>  Well, of course, the first thing that catches your eye is a bright aggressive orange-black design.  Indeed, the color pleases and gives the impression of an active person. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/5ee7c67d/f7e565be/7f1f726b/97f90f63.jpg"><br><br>  It is written on the speakers in large letters where the left is and where the right is, so it will be difficult to confuse. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/3efdf968/c0f6ee2b/f278dd26/40e33c23.jpg"><br><br>  Fasteners and in general, everything is all made of plastic, which contributes to a very soft, but at the same time fitting fit on the head.  And on the handle with a beautiful font (the same as the letter in the previous photo) the model of headphones was written. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/3b1ba823/0ba74f7f/4b33b4ac/6f276599.jpg"><br><br>  The main advantage is that the handle is foldable and the headphones can be pressed into a small volume.  This is useful for women of fashion who love bright colors, but at the same time, they listen to the player only on the road, and at work / study it should be hidden in a handbag.  Moreover, the speakers are spinning in all directions of the world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/5eaebddd/227fcd0a/246c23d5/69213ab6.jpg"><br><br>  Here, the minijack is already made more interesting, albeit at an angle, but smoothly and unusually. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/4d075b73/84082699/b09a45a6/5d7f34c0.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Sound </h4><br>  Again, there is little to be said about the sound in the headphones of the middle class.  Compared with Lyra, Draco has a clearer sound and much better listened to the bass, although it doesn‚Äôt get much ears.  Reproduces qualitatively and at high and at low frequencies.  In principle, they can even come up as a beginner DJ; however, incomplete sound insulation from the outside world can prevent it. <br><br>  I, not a very sophisticated listener, liked it.  Clean, high quality, loud.  Even in the subway was normally audible.  So, again, remember that these are not professional headphones, but custom ones, rather, even fashionable ones. <br><br><h4>  Price </h4><br>  They cost about 1000r., Which is very inexpensive.  Yes, there is no metal here, but there are many mounts that are needed for comfort, as well as an interesting design, so the price is justified.  And the sound is more or less decent. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br><br>  <u>pros</u> <br><br>  + Bright attractive design <br>  + Compact <br>  + Fit well on your head <br><br>  <u>Minuses</u> <br><br>  - The plastic handle may break. <br><br>  Very good middle class headphones.  Folding, "fun", sound high quality, the bass is there, what else is needed for good headphones?  Oh yeah, the price is also quite acceptable, so - everything is in place. <br><br>  By the way, orange is not the only light in which this model comes.  Although there are only two options: orange and green. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/2dfc38ef/8a7d6e5b/28e1b509/0c7d6b54.jpg"><br><br>  But I liked orange more.  ;) <br><br>  Photos were processed with <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/design/84186/">Datacolor SpyderCube</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/103535/">https://habr.com/ru/post/103535/</a></p>
