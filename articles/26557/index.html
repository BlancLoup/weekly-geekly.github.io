  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Comparison of recommendation systems Memorie, Beaver and Wong</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Currently, there is a truly huge number of social online bookmarking services in RuNet.  As in any other industry, there are leaders here - the most visible and ‚Äúpopulated‚Äù by users of services.  Here they are, our heroes: <a href="http://memori.ru/">Memori</a> , <a href="http://bobrdobr.ru/">BobrDobr</a> and <a href="http://www.mister-wong.ru/">Mister Wong</a> . <a name="habracut"></a>  All services are equally convenient for saving bookmarks - they provide a convenient web interface, a set of browser plug-ins and various widgets for sharing your preferences on the web.  But the second main purpose of these services is to provide users with a convenient tool for searching sites on the topic of interest to them, as well as sites for web surfing, relying on the taste of the community that recommends these sites, keeping it in their favorites daily and hourly. <br>  It is not difficult to guess that in the struggle for the attention of the Internet audience there are a number of users who, violating the conditions of working with the service, try in every possible way to put forward their links to the most prominent places of the service - to the main page, second level pages, as well as to those pages which are behind the most popular tags, which have a cloud for each service on the main page in a prominent place.  The second abuse may be the promotion of its links through the creation of a ‚Äúhyperactive user‚Äù, who will add a lot of ‚Äújunk‚Äù bookmarks, as a result of which such a user gets to the main page, and his bookmarks are just a click away from the main page of the service. <br>  This is where the human factor of service holders comes into play, on which the service depends on how dirty or clean the user is, how useful or useless it will be for him. <br><h3>  Homepage tags </h3><br>  The most popular tags of all services are on the main page, without garbage, and it pleases, only Mister Wong does not notice at all that his tag cloud is corrupted by unreadable characters, and the bad weather has caught up with the tags: <i>cars, free of charge</i> and <i>Internet</i> .  It is also fun to see the tag <i>on</i> in the top.  It is good that neither Memori, nor Bobre have such problems. <br><img src="http://roiber.ru/html/resource/images/articles/8/2008-04-13_125618.png"><br>  <font color="#4f81bd"><i>Tag Business</i></font> <br>  For a start, we tried the <i>business</i> tag on all services to see what they gave us for surfing. <br>  Memori.  We have not received any advertising links, only links with educational materials ‚ÄúHome Business Ideas‚Äù, ‚ÄúBest Business Books‚Äù, ‚Äú10 Common Recruiting Errors‚Äù, etc. <br>  "Beaver".  A number of interesting materials are: ‚ÄúFast food for vegetarians.  Business ideas "," Strategies for success. "  The main thing is everything.  The rest is links to financial pyramids, forex traders and other commercial sites that are 100% hit the top by the method described above or by the ‚Äúgood‚Äù will of the administration itself. <br>  Mister Wong.  It seems that there is no moderation.  In the top of the <i>business</i> tag you can buy plastic pipes, register an offshore company in Britain and buy hangers for boutiques.  The rest of the space is filled with <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9">doorway</a> and forex traders.  Only 1-2 useful links to the page.  Why on Mister Wong to click on tags is generally unclear. <br><img src="http://roiber.ru/html/resource/images/articles/8/2008-04-13_135025.png"><br><br><img src="http://roiber.ru/html/resource/images/articles/8/2008-04-13_120302.png"><br><br>  <font color="#4f81bd"><i>Health Tag</i></font> <br>  Memori and "Beaver".  The link set is very good.  Mostly materials for women - weight loss, nutrition, fitness, but for men there are many materials that help to improve their health.  True, ‚ÄúBobr‚Äù has a couple of links to dubious charitable foundations that spoil the picture a bit. <br>  Mister Wong.  There are undoubtedly good and useful links, but there are links that have a lot of Mister Wong ‚Äúusers‚Äù additions, which consist of one link-farm page, and doorway pages that do not make any sense for a person.  Here, for example, the first site in the <i>Health</i> category recommended by Mr. Wong (the most interesting is that the site became interesting to six users!): <br><h3>  Top Users </h3><br>  Comparison of user TORs from the main pages will only take place for Memori and ‚ÄúBeaver‚Äù, since Mister Wong simply does not display such users on the main one. <br>  Memori.  In this -12, spammers periodically skip, but the administration quickly catches them.  This TOP consists of users who add a lot of bookmarks.  To say that this is the best place to search for new bookmarks is impossible, but you can find something unexpected, very often you can find very interesting sites that are difficult to reach in another way. <br><img src="http://roiber.ru/html/resource/images/articles/8/2008-04-13_145259.png"><br>  "Beaver".  The first selected user, <i>povava</i> , who is # 1 from TOP-10 ‚ÄúBeaver‚Äù, offered with all his bookmarks to download for free everything in the world from the same site.

It is worth noting that Mister Wong is an outsider here again - due to the lack of this section. <br>  In Memori, the recommended bookmarks are moderately interesting, though, if only they fall within the scope of your interests.  If the recommendations you do not like, then look for what you need by tags. <br>  In "Bobr" recommended bookmarks are called "Expert bookmarks."  They cannot be called neither good nor bad, since they are very abstruse, far from the real user.  Of the last five bookmarks on the main one, we recommend this: <br><br><img src="http://roiber.ru/html/resource/images/articles/8/2008-04-13_151728.png"><br><br>  Awful if it were the most interesting on the Internet! <br><h3>  Total </h3><br>  Today we understand the rule that says that not all social bookmarking services with similar functionality are equally good.  To add and save your bookmarks is only half the story, which all the participants of the article cope with perfectly well, but not everyone can open something new to you.  Surely, Memori is leading the way in today's tests, which is also not perfect, but its administration takes great pains to ensure that you do not spend time on doorways and on commercial portals for selling gas pipes in search of information of interest to you.  Beaver and Mister Wong were unpleasantly surprised by the fact that almost all links close to the main page lead to spam prepared by members of the service, which the administration simply does not notice or does not want to notice. <br><br>  Vyacheslav Baransky <br>  <strong>Source: <u><a href="http://roiber.ru/articles/8">Royber PC</a></u></strong> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26557/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26557/</a></p>
