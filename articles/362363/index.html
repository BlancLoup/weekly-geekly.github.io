  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Combine multiple packages to save on shipping</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> As a rule, when I tell Habr√© about buying NFC tags for <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/shopozzcom/blog/235273/">conveniently unlocking a phone</a> or about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/shopozzcom/blog/239611/">correct touch gloves</a> , someone always asks - why buy such things abroad, if the cost of goods is two times lower than the cost of shipping? <br><br>  Indeed, with a separate shipment of goods worth 10 dollars, the cost of delivery eats up all the benefits.  However, no one bothers to combine several packages from different stores into one.  Moreover, this service is free for customers of Shopozz.com.  Today I would like to show how this happens with a concrete example. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9f0/74d/c54/9f074dc545a147b7a3617eb1ca571f12.png"><a name="habracut"></a>

      My own post about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/shopozzcom/blog/236953/">bags for geeks</a> ended for me that I could not stand it and climbed to buy a new bag for myself.  Commentators have thrown such a huge amount of good options that it became clear - there are many really high-quality things in the world and it is no longer possible to walk with the current, non-functional bag. <br><br>  I will not bother with the selection process, in the end I decided to buy the <a href="http://www.timbuk2.com/alchemist-laptop-briefcase/164.html%3Fdwvar_164_size%3D8%26dwvar_164_color%3D2001">Timbuk2 Alchemist Laptop Briefcase</a> as the most convenient semi-brief bag with my 12-inch laptop.  If anyone is interested, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DQavmZRXqugw">here</a> is an excellent video showing all the chips of this instance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/072/a42/073/072a420730ab4bcbb64fc5fc03f823e8.jpg"><br><br>  At that moment, when I was eyeing the purchase, the site launched a 30% discount on all products.  Considering that initially Alchemist was worth $ 119, the $ 36 discount was tempting.  Since Timbuk2 does not send its belongings to Russia, it was decided that the discount would go to pay for the delivery through an intermediary. <br><br>  So here we go.  <a href="http://shopozz.com/">We register</a> on the site Shopozz.com and, after confirmation, we obtain a virtual address in the USA in the state of Georgia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d25/9e2/fd1/d259e2fd18644b988a5b480258d2811b.png"><br><br>  Then we register in the stores of interest to us and specify the address obtained in the Shopozz office as the delivery address.  As already mentioned, there may be several stores and packages, as the system allows you to combine several packages into one for free.  In my case, it was Timbuk2 store, where I ordered one bag for myself and another friend (he chose this one).  In addition, I ordered two good covers for the Kindle in the Amazon store (I do this at every opportunity - most of my acquaintances, seeing my cover, ask them to order the same one), plus all sorts of little things that would be individually too expensive to deliver. <br><br>  After the order is formed in stores, the parcel tracking number is sent to the mail.  It is desirable to register in your personal account Shopozz.  Why it is desirable - without tracking the parcel, of course, will appear in your office, but it may take extra time.  And so, she'll fight the same will be displayed in the "in stock" section.  You can add tracking with the button ‚ÄúI'm waiting for a package‚Äù located in the right corner. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/88e/751/b76/88e751b76c5440a09811ce09b2fefd81.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to tracking, you can attach a photo of the goods to each package.  So buying from a set of numbers turns into something meaningful (this is especially useful when there are a lot of packages).  As the goods arrive at the warehouse, the parcels from the ‚Äúawaiting receipt‚Äù section will move to the ‚Äúin stock‚Äù section.  If you specify your phone number in the service settings, then the corresponding SMS will come to you when a new package arrives. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/452/c64/b0c/452c64b0c3c14ec8b5bd87f091e45bf3.png"><br><br>  So, both my packages came to the warehouse.  A curious nuance - the delivery of the bag was free, and it traveled through all the States for about a week.  Ordered three days later, Amazon also delivered free shipping.  But, thanks to the close location of the warehouse, they came to Shopozz in less than 24 hours and the first.  So when ordering products available on Amazon, it makes no sense to overpay for faster delivery - it will still be brought quickly. <br><br>  Since the bag was not the cheapest, besides the possible defects should be easily visible during an external examination, it was decided to order the service "check product" and "photo".  The cost of this service is $ 15. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f95/440/2fa/f954402fa7e04745b3e818cc1ff08b1f.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e88/51d/ed2/e8851ded22694604a061ede0c2f57b83.jpg"><br><br>  About why this service is needed, especially when buying used goods, some time ago, <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/rrepeen/" class="user_link">rrepeen</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/shopozzcom/blog/236245/">wrote</a> very well.  You can order this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8d4/d6a/7fc/8d4d6a7fc06f4e2cf7af355ea2d746d8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  and get dusty like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c68/b64/e9a/c68b64e9add3ca0cc57393baa5cbc126.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In my case, everything turned out to be in order, and I proceed to the next step: combining the packages.  To do this, a check mark is placed in front of each parcel and the button ‚Äúcombine parcels‚Äù is pressed.  In the note, you can specify additional comments for the collector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/511/4e1/815/5114e18152084a78979561119505aa58.png"><br><br>  After the parcels are packaged, they fall into the ‚Äúwaiting for payment‚Äù section.  At this stage, you choose the delivery method and, accordingly, the cost, calculated on the basis of the weight of the parcel.  In my case, the parcel weighed 3 kg and contained five items.  It was possible to send a package through Priority Mail International for $ 69 - and it would go 2-4 weeks.  But I chose the more expensive and faster version of Express Mail International for $ 82, when the package is delivered in Russia via EMS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/637/9ba/0cf/6379ba0cf6c44a7dba4855591e0abc6c.png"><br><br>  So, in the evening I receive a message that the parcel is ready for shipment, I pay for delivery via Webmoney (replenishment from the card, Yandex.Money, via the Contact, RBK Money system, Golden Crown, through the payment in Euroset Salons, Svyaznoy and Post Offices is also available Russia).  On the same night, the parcel crashes to my address and the status on the site changes to "sent" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/22f/ec0/77f/22fec077fbe449308d3dd83b50028b5c.png"><br><br>  Then I prepared to wait for a long and tedious passage of customs.  However, to my surprise, the parcel slipped through customs clearance on the third day, flew to my city in the morning of the seventh, and after lunch was brought by courier.  Total 7 days from the moment you clicked the ‚Äúsend‚Äù button to the mural in the delivery note at the courier.  And this is despite the fact that I do not live in Moscow or St. Petersburg. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/761/4e8/e30/7614e8e30c55453bada0a1b49a6c39dc.png"><br><br>  To be honest, the packages did not reach me so quickly.  On the one hand, it is very joyful - the parcel arrived from another continent faster than the same bag traveled around the States.  On the other hand, it is sad that so quickly.  The fact is that Shopozz guarantees the terms of its delivery and delayed delivery for more than two weeks, I would receive a compensation equal to the cost of shipping. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/64e/d45/903/64ed459039394e8c815868636e9c1bf0.jpg"><br><br>  The parcel arrived packed in durable cardboard.  To prevent moisture ingress, the contents were hidden in an additional plastic bag.  So there are no complaints about the packaging. <br><br>  Well, now the most important thing is whether it was worth it at all.  So, the bags: they are not sold in Russia, the price without a discount is $ 119 and $ 99, respectively.  A 30% discount was $ 65.  Two covers: voted one of the recommended sites to be the best unofficial Kindle covers.  Cost - $ 11 each.  Considering that we have more or less normal Chinese Kindle covers for somewhere around 700-800 rubles, we get about $ 15 savings.  Total $ 80 net profit, if you do not take into account that these products are not sold in Russia at all.  As you can see, even more expensive speedy delivery paid off in the end.  And even such a trifle, as the covers for $ 11, were delivered with a profit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b3/8c7/e0c/2b38c7e0c08446da8cadbe2a7655bb20.JPG"><br>  <i>Come bag and Kindle sticking out of the pocket on the right in a new cover</i> <br><br>  To summarize, combining packages is a good way to buy lots of nice little things and deliver them quickly and relatively inexpensively.  This is especially relevant on the eve of the New Year, when it happens that you need to buy a lot of inexpensive, but original gifts. <br><br>  I remind you that you read the blog of the company Shopozz, a free Mail Forwarding service from the USA.  With pleasure, at a low price and in guaranteed time, Shopozz will deliver everything that you want to buy in the USA and other countries.
