      <br>
      As much as I remember myself in IT, I hear as much talk about the fact that there is no money in IT and that this area cannot bring how much money there would be.  The funny thing is that the area is absolutely nothing to do with.  Instead of ‚ÄúIT‚Äù you can substitute medicine, pedagogy, logistics, sports, etc.  But nobody cares, articles about the hard life of the masters of the keyboard appear annually after the next spring / autumn aggravation and cause a lot of discussions.  What do you want to talk about?  Actually, I will try, based on my own experience and the experience of those I see every day, to tell about whether you can earn in IT and, if so, how to do it.  Since IT is a ‚Äúspherical horse in a vacuum,‚Äù let's define it and talk about ITpro, that is, about prof.  engineers working in the field of information technology. <br><br>  <b>Problematics</b> <br><br>  The essence of the problem is simple - everyone wants money, money for a good beautiful life, regular rest, imported cars, real estate and a lot of a lot of things.  ITpro does not differ from ordinary people here, they want the same.  The hitch is that we would live not in Singapore, not in the USA, not in Canada, not in Hong Kong, and not even in South Korea.  The technological development of our country at the level of the African Gambia is an objective reality.  It would seem - well, not plowed field for ITpro, the work should be stored 100 years in advance, and the need for specialists to constantly grow.  But I perfectly see that while oil will cost money, and for pumping it out there will be enough ‚Äúexisting pumps‚Äù, the development of technologies (including IT) with the current government will be limited to Petrik‚Äôs filters and nano-viburnum. <br><br>  In reality, the foregoing results in: <br><br>  1. Weak use of information technology in life and work. <br>  2. Low need for IT specialists. <br>  3. Low level zp in the industry. <br>  4. The concentration of demand for qualified personnel in the personnel markets of the two capitals. <br><br>  I am not a supporter of sprinkling ashes on my head and shouting that everything is lost.  I think, even under such conditions, there is life in the Russian IT market.  And so it‚Äôs worth the work. <br><br>  We will immediately agree, if you need Ferrari, villas, islands and other elements of Abramovich‚Äôs life, then you shouldn‚Äôt read further, it‚Äôs better to choose another path right away, create your google or go to rob a country, people, banks, in general, to whom you prefer.  On the island in ITpro earn unrealistic. <br><br>  <b>7 points of application of force.</b> <br><br>  <b>1. Knowledge.</b> <br>  The paradox is that, on the one hand, the need for IT is low, and on the other hand, skilled personnel are rare.  Ie even in the case when the office is ready to pay well - for months it cannot find a person with the necessary knowledge.  The first point of application of power is your head.  If you want to make money in IT, get ready to be an eternal student.  Courses, conferences, books, stands, experiments, work - these are the sources that need to pump the brain. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <i>What would this "pumping was effective" I can advise the following:</i> <br><br>  a) Do not spray effort, pay for in-depth knowledge and experience.  Attempting to ride 1000 directions results in the appearance of a ‚Äúsuper-dzhedya‚Äù, which he knows everywhere and a little bit.  In my opinion this is not the best option in terms of making money. <br><br>  b) Try not to learn rare non-mass technologies.  I admit that being a single specialist for the whole of Russia using the Bla-Bla-Database technology can make good money, but I still think that it is easier to live in a market where there are many customers even with more competition.  The second aspect is that it is impossible to learn normally rare technologies without practice.  And the practice of rare technology is more difficult to find. <br>  Summarizing the first point - starting education (school, technical school, university) is good, but in our area any knowledge without an update turns into trash.  And if you don‚Äôt listen to Lenin‚Äôs grandfather and study, learn and study again, you will very quickly find yourself at the back of the trough.  Personally, I always have a plan, what I teach now, what tomorrow, and what in a month.  And even if the reality differs from the plan very strongly, this is not a reason to abandon self-development. <br><br>  <b>2. Language.</b> <br><br>  It so happened historically that the computer revolution was forged in an English-speaking country, which in turn could not but affect the language of the profession.  Learning the language of a person claiming to be ITpro will have without any options.  Documentation, though Russified, but the quality of localization and its completeness often leave much to be desired.  It may take several years from the moment information appears in English until the appearance of a counterpart in Russian.  Or it may not come at all, that happy moment when some topic will be available in the native language.  This is clearly visible on difficult topics.  The most requested information is localized, and you can read the ‚Äúdeep dive‚Äù in the language of Shakespeare.  The intermediate conclusion is that - ignorance of the English language reduces the efficiency of your work several times. <br><br>  Since we are talking about "how to make money", naturally, our goal is a big and rich company, preferably with a world name.  In 95% of cases, this company with foreign capital, and therefore with a very high probability, some of the employees in it are English-speaking.  In this case, the company one of the mandatory requirements will be the language.  I am not a supporter of investing a lot of money in learning the language, as I understand perfectly well that without practice, any knowledge will evaporate instantly.  Therefore, I believe that you need to learn 3-4 thousand words and forget about the Russian-language documentation once and for all, as well as be able to speak at the level of ‚ÄúMy name is Boris, uh, from Russia.  Yu shud haira mi. "  If you need to work in a western company, you can easily explain.  Well, you can tighten the level and in the process when it is really necessary.  Usually, employers go for it and give several months to ‚Äúcomplete the language of learning‚Äù.  In the process of writing this article, I was told that Microsoft requires an intermedia level of language skills.  And this is somewhat more than ‚ÄúMay Name of Boris‚Äù.  Although I know exactly the cases when people worked for this employer, and the exam was successfully passed only after a year.  It all depends on the interest in the candidacy. <br><br>  Total - the language is needed to learn faster than others and the fact that the rest is not available.  Well, work where the rest of the road is closed. <br><br>  <b>3. Job selection strategy.</b> <br><br>  Discussions on the features of the choice of work can shine a book, but since this is a different format, I want to briefly list those recommendations that I consider to be correct.  The first 5-6 years after high school are the most important, because they give you experience and a name that will then feed you.  In the first 3 years of work between an employer who pays 10 thousand rubles and an interesting job and 20 thousand and boring, I advise you to choose the first one.  So your goal is 200 thousand and a temporary money gain gives you a strategic career loss.  Each work should give the opportunity to develop.  There are no ready-made specialists, a specialist studies at 50 years of age, and since experience is the best teacher, work should become a textbook for you.  If you think that wiping your pants for 20 thousand is steeper than working for 10, then you will wipe them before retirement and never reach the goal of the same 200. Once again, what has been said is especially aimed at specialists starting their careers. <br><br>  Do not be afraid to change jobs.  As my experience shows, to achieve success in working at a certain position in IT, 1.5 years is enough.  Then you begin to master the bread masterfully and spit "the ceiling" the rest of the time.  If you are at the first 6 years of your career, change your job, look for the one that will allow you to grow.  Or try to grow within the company, changing positions within. <br><br>  You stopped paying salary - change your job.  Management doesn't need IT - change jobs. <br>  Here they can cut me off and say that changing jobs is not always possible due to the lack of a proposal.  Alas, you are right.  IT is an area that needs industry.  The industry is served by accountants, economists, logisticians, lawyers, engineers, etc ... And IT is the one that automates all this service staff.  An engineer is not a doctor whom people will turn to, even if only ‚Äúdigging sticks‚Äù remain on the ground.  The industry we have with great regret is now one - mining.  All service part is concentrated in one city - Moscow.  Therefore, whether you like it or not, as you develop, you will definitely encounter a situation when in your hometown you are simply not needed.  You are Overqualified.  They either need a simple job, or even a hard job, but for a penny.  And here are two ways.  The first is to compare with the fact that you will not pay more N rubles and learn how to enjoy what you have.  Or the second - pack your bags.  Immediately answer the comments: what will happen if everyone leaves?  Answer: First, everyone will not leave, and secondly, let those who sit in the Kremlin think about it.  A specific person has a task - to make his life better. <br><br>  Total: at the initial stage of a career, a change of employer or position every year - one and a half.  New job, should give you the opportunity to increase your knowledge and experience.  You see that you have rested against the ceiling, change the city, country, planet, etc ... And after the first 2-3 years of work, I am fundamentally against changing jobs with lowering salaries.  This is an extreme case for crisis force majeure.  Teach everyone and yourself that you are worth the money. <br><br>  <b>4. Active position and self-confidence.</b> <br><br>  There is a good phrase - ‚Äúnot the gods are burning pots‚Äù.  And although she is quite famous, many people do not listen to her and spoil / hinder their careers.  I remember a shot from the film when Fedor from Shurik's Adventures shouts ‚ÄúI‚Äù for each vacancy and takes a step forward.  This is certainly an exaggerated example, but still a good guideline for the movement.  Do not be afraid of "moving".  All the phrases ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt,‚Äù ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt cope,‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have enough experience‚Äù, ‚Äúoh, they‚Äôll not take me there, probably there are 1000 resumes per hour‚Äù, ‚ÄúI never did this, I can‚Äôt‚Äù people who don't need money.  All once for the first time, yes it can be difficult, but you can get a couple of working nights, it may or may not be.  But 100% will never succeed if you seek excuses and excuses for not doing something.  Look for opportunities anytime, anywhere.  Certification - Yes!  Speak at MSR club - Yes!  Participate in the project - Yes!  Take no more responsibility at work ‚ÄìYes!  Go to another interesting position - Yes!  Only in this way and nothing else. <br><br>  <b>5. Work a lot.</b> <br><br>  Humble, any success is 99% of work.  And those who say that this is nonsense are simply looking for an excuse for their own laziness.  The first rule of a person who wants to receive a lot for his work sounds like this - ‚Äúdo it as if you are doing it to yourself‚Äù.  In our country and in the world as a whole, there is a crisis of quality, people believe that if you can shuffle and get money, then you just need to freeze.  If you can not do the work, and no one will know, then of course you should not do it.  From this psychology we get the auto industry, falling satellites, unglued shoes and much more.  Will you buy the second shoes of the company, whose first shoes were scattered in a month?  Will not.  Your task is to hire you, the employer understands that he is ‚Äúbuying a Mercedes.‚Äù  And no one asks why Mercedes is worth more than other cars.  For the concept of quality has grown together with the brand name. <br>  Get used to measuring work not in hours, but in concept did or did not.  When work is not done in time, you can work at 2 am and 6 am.  And you can all night.  This is normal.  If you cannot do this, you are lazy or hard, then others will earn money. <br><br>  Understand that working in a company, there is always a way to earn more.  This is consulting, all sorts of ‚Äúshabashki‚Äù, writing articles, translations of documentation, teaching, part-time work in second place, etc. ... You can sit on several chairs until the quality starts to suffer.  And you can‚Äôt let a drop in quality.  The second and third chair can bring 10-50% of additional income and it is impossible to refuse such an opportunity. <br><br>  <b>6. Society and communication.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Be sociable and friendly.  Meet people anytime, anywhere.  Connections drive the world.  Life example: a friend of mine with whom we met by chance a few years ago at one of the forums, now works at Microsoft, because at one time I was able to show myself well on one of the projects I recommended him to another person with whom I in turn, met when they wrote an article together.  Those.  three people from three different cities, who had never seen each other live before, got what they wanted.  I am a friend and an article, a friend is an excellent job at Microsoft, the third person is an excellent project.  And all because they talked.  It is clear that there are still 100,500 variables that should have been matched, but one of the most important - familiarity should be put at the head.  Make connections, meet, use social networks, etc.  You do not know in advance what kind of connection it will ‚Äúshoot‚Äù, and therefore you should not be bombarded by people. <br><br>  <b>7. Decency.</b> <br><br>  The specificity of life is such that there are always few good specialists.  And those that are always known and among themselves and employers.  For a long and fruitful career, knowledge is not enough, it is very important to be a decent person.  He scored the job, did not quit, got into a fight with a colleague in the shop, got drunk on the corporate party and fired all the words, deactivated a competitor - all of this will be spread by word of mouth in two hours and then you will be ordered to work in decent companies.  Remember this, examples of ‚Äúspecialists‚Äù with wolf tickets are more than enough.  Do not replenish their ranks. <br><br>  <b>P.S.</b> <br><br>  I do not claim to be the ultimate truth, all of the above is my subjective point of view.  Considers otherwise?  Great, your right.  Well, I, in turn, believe that being ITpro you can earn and earn well (exactly like being a carpenter, a pilot, a builder, etc.).  Although the concept is also well subjective. <br><br>  <i>Good luck!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Sincerely, <a href="http://www.specialist.ru/trainer/%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25B8">Ilya Rud</a> .</i> <i><br></i>  <i>MCT / MVP</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136095/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136095/</a></p>
