      What eventually happened, why not do so, or how to save 200 thousand rubles? <br><br>  <b>Case under the cut</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  1. The first pancake </h3><br>  The store owes its appearance simply to the will of chance, since it was not planned at all in advance.  He is the brainchild of the studio MakeShop.pro.  LEDROID.ru was one of her first cases.  But a store was being developed for one of our clients, who later changed his mind to open the site and did not pay for the work already completed by that time. <br><br>  But I did not think the goodness was going to disappear.  And to really have your own store would be nice.  And the matter is not so much in additional earnings as in gaining one‚Äôs own experience.  Since LEDROID.ru and began its development. <br><br>  At the time of the start of good templates on CS-Cart really was not.  And the simplest, cheapest and fastest way was the adaptation of the standard template. <br><br>  <b>It looks like this:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rc/on/ha/rconha8vfz6hdbj85adbeiqggeo.png"><br><br>  Naturally, the customer wanted diversity and adaptation to his tasks.  That's why we started sketching. <br><br>  <b>As a result, the main page seemed to us as follows:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m9/rn/fh/m9rnfhyrguashpmhzki38ad9t8c.png"><br><br>  A feature of the store was the ability to select products from the main page using a filter.  The visitor was asked to enter only the basic parameters of the desired product and then select the appropriate option from the proposed range.  But this decision did not justify itself, so at the moment we have refused the filter on the main page.  The menu with categories and subcategories of goods turned out to be more popular. <br><br>  <b>Unfortunately, we did not save the original version.</b>  <b>But it looked like this:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8k/ez/tg/8keztgi3wzgspmygonhpddqzwis.png"><br><br>  In this form, we existed for about a year.  And in general, quite positive. <br><br><h3>  2. Option number two.  Pain. </h3><br>  In general, the store felt good and sold.  But time passed and the idea to update the design began to visit us more often.  At that time, we thought that the coolest options could be spied on in the foreign market.  Actually there and turned their gaze. <br><br>  We have approached the implementation of the second option with more seriousness.  The sketch was drawn in color and scale. <br><br>  <b>Here he is:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j7/hq/3f/j7hq3f_cyvfs4kb5zou91gzbp90.png"><br><br>  Provided various marketing chips.  Banners.  Block with main categories.  Added a block to quickly track your order. <br><br>  As time went.  We sawed.  And thus all the pages were worked out.  As a result, the sketches were transferred to the work of the designer. <br><br>  <b>Something turned out the following:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n9/fd/zv/n9fdzvuljtk4jvbz6tjdl3rll3u.png"><br><br>  I was not happy, looked like a site from the late eighties.  Apparently not those foreign sites we watched. <br><br>  This is still only a quarter of the work.  A month and a half has already passed.  Further, all this was necessary to impose, to develop the necessary modules. <br><br>  <b>Total spent:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jg/ta/bt/jgtabtnxrdmlli6pyhym4tssa80.jpeg"><br><br><ul><li>  on drawing a sketch - time, </li><li>  on design - studio resources, </li><li>  on the layout - studio resources, </li><li>  for modules that no one else needs - studio resources. </li></ul><br>  At that moment when we were still drawing sketches, there was already a ready-made good template on the market.  But since  the forces have already been spent enough, and the toad choked us and did not allow us to reject this mouse fuss and just roll it.  We injected and continued to eat the cactus. <br><br><h4>  Result </h4><br>  Half of the modules we have not done.  Yes, and in the process of layout they refused from many things from design.  The site looked like this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a8/m-/ku/a8m-kuahzweby0c5ih17awcapqe.png"><br><br><h3>  3. Three drop everything and roll a pattern </h3><br>  And yet we are tired of sawing golden weights and chasing the departing train.  We threw this bad job.  They commissioned the designer to develop a new logo and brand colors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/so/2o/1r/so2o1rms-kpu6ykxb50cjk9sv2g.png"><br><br>  Bought a template and related modules to it ~ 12,000 rubles. <br>  Rolled a template ~ work day. <br><br><h4>  Got the following result </h4><br>  <b>Home page</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3w/vw/kf/3wvwkfcka2kujqgi1o2zdllhttw.png"><br><br>  <b>Card Product</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6a/zo/q7/6azoq7-cseyg5vg8rpy8zjxbbdq.png"><br><br>  What did you get with the template?  If in one sentence, then this is a bunch of modules that are updated and expanded, adaptability and elaboration. <br><br><h4>  And if on points, then (kopipasta from the module press release): </h4><br>  <b>100% Adaptability, convenience in all details.</b>  The template looks great on tablet screens in both horizontal and vertical position. <br><br>  <b>SEO optimization.</b>  Fixed CS-Cart bugs. <br><br>  <b>Fixed, adaptive top panel of the site.</b>  The panel included all the main navigation elements.  When scrolling content, the panel takes a fixed position at the top of the site and allows the client to always see the menu, search, office and cart. <br><br>  <b>Perfect menu.</b>  The menu is flexible. <br><br>  <b>Three types of product presentation.</b>  Three types of product cards.  You can choose the most appropriate look for your product. <br><br>  <b>The size of the discount affects the color of the nameplate.</b>  Marketing chip. <br><br>  <b>Buttons "Category full screen width" and "Hide filters".</b>  This functionality allows with one click to stretch the layout of the list of goods to the full width of the page, and also to hide the filter block, which will allow the buyer to focus on the choice of commodity items. <br><br>  <b>Expanded banners.</b>  Create professional, responsive banners without design skills, just copy the picture and enter texts into the editor.  In 2 minutes you will get the most effective, adaptive banner in any resolutions, which can also carry SEO functions. <br><br>  <b>Banners in the category.</b>  Place banners directly in the product grid of category pages, advertise, notify, stimulate in an original and effective way, as market leaders do. <br><br>  <b>Product of the day.</b>  Create promotional items marked with a special nameplate in the lists, as well as having a countdown timer until the end of the action on their cards.  Advertise them actively on the main page with the help of a special promo block. <br><br>  And this is not a complete list of features of the template for $ 200. <br><br><h3>  Morality </h3><br>  Do you want to check or go? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/re/0k/9r/re0k9rp5jpcbbbb8uulireemrzo.png"><br><br>  The moral of the story is, the online store must sell.  The design should not interfere.  The site should be convenient first of all for the client. <br><br>  Individual solutions are like a homemade car.  It seems cool, but expensive and long.  Not everyone will master.  It's easier to buy a conveyor solution and finish it if necessary.  Individual solutions are possible, most often these are some narrow niches. <br><br><h4>  Conclusions (points) that we have learned for ourselves: </h4><br><ul><li>  A mass product that the team is working on will be better than cutting something alone.  Unless it's some kind of narrow task or niche. </li><li>  It is never too late to turn around and reconsider if you feel that you are going in the wrong direction. </li><li>  Do not cling to the old, try to look at things soberly. </li><li>  Time is money.  While you impose something, competitors sell. </li></ul><br><h3>  Parting words </h3><br>  If you decide to make your site using template solutions, then the choice of a template should be approached seriously and responsibly, as well as the choice of the engine.  Be sure to find out how well tech support works with the developers of this template, how often updates come out and whether the template is generally supported.  Examine the demo sites and opportunities before buying, ask for a presentation and tell you about the points of interest.  Otherwise, all the advantages described above can easily become minuses. <br><br><h3>  P.S. </h3><br>  In monetary terms, it is difficult to say exactly how much this experiment cost us.  But if we estimate that we began to draw the sketch in November 2016, we rolled out a new design for the site in February 2017. And it was not a complete version.  That scale, I would rate thousands in 200-250. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/419127/">https://habr.com/ru/post/419127/</a></p>
