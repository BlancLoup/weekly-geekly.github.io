Successful PM requires experience, enthusiasm and, of course, professional management skills, communication and other abilities.  The set of these qualities helps the expert to correctly present the product and bring it to the market. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ea/7c2/23c/7ea7c223c328781dd3761a6d466e3f61.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The product manager should take care of the success of the product or service from the conceptual stage to the final release and market positioning.  It is in the interests of the manager to always know <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/hygger/blog/353164/">how to correctly use the product strategy</a> and focus on global management trends. <br><br>  Young professionals at the very beginning of their career as a product manager may feel pressured by management or personnel managers who, logically, will want to discover the potential and ‚Äúpull out‚Äù all the professional skills and abilities of the new talent.  Often they have their own virtual list of expectations, the purpose of which is to determine the professional and personal qualities of future product managers.  Applicants are confronted with this list during interviews.

      The list of expectations can be simple, and sometimes carefully thought out and long enough.  In general, product owners, CEOs, and HRs always have a portrait of an ideal product manager who consists of certain expectations.  What are the skills, abilities and qualities that a modern product manager should possess? <br><br><h2>  Skills of a successful product manager </h2><br>  For many large corporations, the role of product manager is fairly new.  In startups, such a position can be found more often.  Time very quickly showed the benefits of this role for companies of different sizes and industries. <br><br>  The duties and responsibilities of PM in companies may differ, since much depends on the specifics of the product, audience, market, team and other factors.  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/hygger/blog/353336/">Technical PM is different from a business-oriented product manager</a> , the roles of managers in an IT company or in retail will also vary.  However, the key skills for the product manager remain similar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c20/9f2/e8c/c209f2e8c636e57ab533fd970ac101f3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You can find many classifications of the necessary PM skills and qualities or suggest your own version.  We propose to consider 6 main categories: key professional skills and abilities of a product manager, personal qualities, interpersonal characteristics, analytical skills, cross-functional skills, as well as the skills that are so necessary today to effectively use professional tools and <a href="https://hygger.io/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%2520article%26utm_medium%3Dlink%26utm_campaign%3Dproduct%2520manager%2520skills">services for managing products</a> . <br><br><h3>  Professional skills product manager </h3><br><ul><li>  Creation and implementation of product strategy.

Such tools help to apply all your knowledge and skills with the help of intelligent technologies and, thereby, optimize and structure your work and the work of the whole team. <br><br>  A modern product manager is not limited to a basic set of services for efficient operation, but uses special management platforms. <br><br>  Separate PM functionality requires separate services or tools options.  For example, managing the backlog of a product is an important part of the work of a product manager. <br><br>  <b>Product Backlog</b> is a unique repository of ideas, initiatives, requests from customers and important product requirements.  Working with backlog helps to prioritize and streamline all ideas for further iteration planning. <br><br>  In the <a href="https://hygger.io/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%2520article%26utm_medium%3Dlink%26utm_campaign%3Dproduct%2520manager%2520skills">Hygger.io</a> platform, <a href="https://hygger.io/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%2520article%26utm_medium%3Dlink%26utm_campaign%3Dproduct%2520manager%2520skills">backend</a> controls offer convenient <b>Value and Efforts</b> parameters for each idea. <br><br><ul><li>  Value indicates what value a particular function can bring to a business or product. </li><li>  Efforts helps assess the resources needed to complete a task. </li></ul><br>  <b>Backlog Priority Chart</b> helps to easily visualize backlog - a chart for optimizing product priorities.  With its help it is easy to identify the most important and least significant tasks at the moment. <br><br>  The schedule consists of four segments, each of which represents a certain block of priorities: <br><br><ul><li>  Time Sinks - for tasks that are not worth working on now. </li><li>  Maybes - for tasks that now do not carry much value, but they are easy to implement.  You can return to them later. </li><li>  Big Bets - for tasks that can bring more value, but difficult to implement. </li><li>  Quick Wins - for tasks that are valuable and fairly simple to implement. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/567/4b4/853/5674b4853e63a9720cedc810cbab2cd5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Another example of a mandatory tool in the arsenal of a modern product manager is the <b>Product Roadmap</b> ( <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/hygger/blog/352294/">roadmap or product development plan</a> ). <br><br>  Product managers can share this visualized plan with other team members and product stakeholders.  This includes global and small-scale initiatives, product requirements, and planned ideas. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/981/4ce/7a3/9814ce7a3f592b4fb7858415a63fcb88.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  These are just two examples of strategic product management tools.  The manager‚Äôs work also helps track time, delegate tasks, communicate with the team, prepare reports and work schedules, organize tasks, and many other functions that offer platforms for managing products. <br><br>  <i>What PM tools do you use?</i>  <i>And how do they help apply the skills, skills and qualities of a product manager?</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/353814/">https://habr.com/ru/post/353814/</a></p>
