This time I will comprehend science quickly and work well.  The teachers are the Swedes. <br><br>  Briefly the essence: "Think better - write faster".  Very good for small teams. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first day began with two rallies. <br>  The first meeting was dedicated to the technical details of the upcoming project.  All of them were divided into regions, for example: <br><ul><li>  System improvements </li><li>  Product1 </li><li>  Product2 </li><li>  Adaptation </li></ul>

      Each area contains several tasks. <br><br>  The second rally was an introductory lecture on how we will work. <br><br>  An important resource is time.  We were told at once: ‚ÄúYou have almost no time, and there is no room for error, either.‚Äù <br><br>  We were all divided into teams.  Commands are shared on the principle of similarity of expertise.  For example, I know product1 well, my neighbor knows product2, his neighbor knows product1.  So the first team is me and the neighbor, the second team is my neighbor.  This separation is a small departure from the SCRUM concept. <br><br>  SCRUM assumes the following: <br>  1. All people in the team know everything. <br>  2. Anyone can do the work of their neighbor. <br><br>  This approach is necessary for the rapid implementation of the tasks.  The project itself assumes the presence of "workpackages" (product) and "features" (functionality or just features).  The product must be finished before a specific date.  To be in time for everything - the manager divides this period into sprints. <br><br>  Sprint is a short period of time for which features should be made.  Sprint can not be stretched, you can only throw it away or replace it with another.  If the team is ahead of the plan, you can add a sprint.  Sprints can be swapped.  Ie - it is like a small project, giving the final product at the output. <br><br>  Since planning is done in real time, the manager and the team must know the status of the work done.  To do this, every day they gather for exactly 15 minutes, and each answers 3 questions: <br><ul><li>  What I've done? </li><li>  What will i do? </li><li>  Do I have a problem? </li></ul><br><br>  The rally is held necessarily standing.  As we were told, this is so that people would not spread out over chairs and be in good shape. <br>  The rally is organized by the SCRUM Master (I don‚Äôt know how he is selected.) His task is to solve problems in a team and set a direction. <br><br>  The work process itself is divided into two stages: <br><ul><li>  Implementation of functionality </li><li>  Testing </li></ul><br><br>  The latter plays almost the main role.  The feature is not considered complete until it has been tested, and the tests have not been successful. <br><br>  Testing is conducted daily of all products included in the project. <br>  Weekly, the entire system.  Weekly testing shows how our products work in conjunction with products from other projects. <br>  Also, each designer is obliged to test his feature (write tests and chase them away) before merging a project into the main branch. <br><br>  One of my roles in the team is responsible for testing.  For me, this is a new and interesting experience. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/50365/">https://habr.com/ru/post/50365/</a></p>
