      <br>
      The collection box included three vinyl records, a widescreen artbook and an audio cassette with unpublished songs of the group. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yw/il/qh/ywilqhieffimxk9h2whrvcz6t-4.jpeg"><br><br>  The latest track on an audio cassette (on the B side, 38: 57‚Äì39: 12) was called the ‚ÄúOK Computer program‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ji/iy/mx/jiiymxb4b7apafbvbwws5kut-my.jpeg"><br><br>  For ordinary listeners, it consisted of strange squeaking sounds, and at the beginning of the recording you can hear sounds typical of the ZX Spectrum computer, which was very popular in the early 80s, in which you can use audio tapes to load games and programs into memory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9v/jf/yn/9vjfynmiks7ctch94uil2vwxd2a.jpeg"><br><br>  But just so directly download the audio data from the cassette to the ZX Spectrum or its emulator turned out to be impossible, since the program does not pick up with such a load. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7c/ea/ng/7ceangmnr1mgdrm7pgf2f_euegg.jpeg"><br><br>  It is necessary to cut the final fragment and pass it through a low-pass filter (instructions for processing the sound file and launching the program are <a href="https://medium.com/%40maciejkorsan/how-to-run-secret-zx-spectrum-message-from-radioheads-oknotok-c90-tape-795bfd429ba1">located here</a> ). <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JDM5YBS6KMc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2_/5z/7f/2_5z7f3zkquqdgj6n5_fdjfjcom.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/33/de/ng/33dengr0mqnbg5kzsqcxfaejqc4.jpeg"><br><br>  As a result, ZX Spectrum will display the following text: <br>  <i>‚ÄúYou have Thomas York, Colin Greenwood, Jonathan Greenwood, Edward O'Brien, Philip Silway, Nigel Godrich and Stanley Downwood in your computer,‚Äù the date is below: December 19, 1996, which is half a year before the release of the very OK Computer album.</i> <br><br>  Next, run the code that displays random colored tiles and letters to random sounds. <br><br>  There is no exact data on whether this program was really written in 1996 or whether it was specially developed for the collectible reprint of the album. <br><br>  Although, in 2003, Radiohead guitarist Johnny Greenwood told in one of his interviews that as a child he had a ZX Spectrum computer, on which he even tried to program. <br><br>  But that's not all.  There is Easter eggs in Easter eggs! <br><br>  When you run the program, you can find the following text in the computer‚Äôs RAM: <i>‚ÄúCongratulations ... hmmmmm.</i>  <i>We should get out more. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ze/4c/y2/ze4cy22vdbn_jvq0kx4m36fh_2g.png"><br><br>  These are references to Pink Floyd and its founder, Syd Barrett, who died in 2006. <br>  Thus, it can be said that the program was written or changed later than 2006. <br><br>  It is interesting that there in the first lines of the program is timed. <br><br>  <b>And now about the reality of the fictional game development company Tuckersoft.</b> <br><br>  Many fans of the series "Black Mirror" have already dismantled the last very intriguing interactive episode about programmers and games called "Brandashmyg" in terms of their content. <br><br>  But here, in addition to the visual video, in which there are references to the mythical company Tuckersoft, the site of which actually exists, we can also enjoy the sounds of the program for the ZX Spectrum! <br><br>  To hear these sounds, you need to ... view the episode to the very end, correctly reaching the definite necessary ending, and there after all the captions there is a scene where the main character (the scene repeats the episode from the beginning of the movie) sits on the bus, but instead of choosing the music its already completed game, when playing which sounds only a strange squeaky noise. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jv/yq/ci/jvyqciefquhic7xqzkulhjk42c4.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nx/q0/fd/nxq0fd5jys73ag68giiwyj1hut0.png"><br><br>  And here again, you need to process the audio file a little (45 second audio file with the program will work) and run it on the emulator. <br><br>  This program will be loaded with a QR code on the ZX Spectrum: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UBJNXzfZ4pw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  By the way, one of the viewers of the series was able to run this program on a real ZX Spectrum! <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U4df1nhVZuY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  After decoding the QR code, <a href="https://tuckersoft.net/ealing20541/">we get the URL</a> . <br><br>  And we get into a specially created and rather archaic specially created virtual world of Tuckersoft company! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rn/wb/ml/rnwbml1rgn45ulp-dw_zmvkdax8.jpeg"><br><br>  Although earlier, viewers of the series came here at <a href="https://tuckersoft.net/">tuckersoft.net</a> , but here they were waited for by a stub and an announcement about finding a new programmer-designer of gaming applications on very cool computers! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/or/-l/zf/or-lzfjpal9y0onyzbwokgrzl6a.jpeg"><br><br>  Although you can <a href="https://www.nic.ru/whois/%3Fipartner%3D3522%26adv_id%3D41%26utm_source%3Dyandexdirect%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_campaign%3D33_-_whois_russia_search%26utm_content%3D%257Cc%253A16061145%257Cg%253A1146178745%257Cb%253A1583205132%257Ck%253A4863537855%257Cst%253Asearch%257Ca%253Ano%257Cs%253Anone%257Ct%253Apremium%257Cp%253A1%257Cr%253A%257Cdev%253Adesktop%26yclid%3D18227314165708786500%26searchWord%3Dtuckersoft.net">call their administrator</a> and chat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/08/lo/sh/08loshbfwh19kkpzu2fqrlq6adi.jpeg"><br><br>  And there is a <a href="">game ‚ÄúNohzdyve‚Äù</a> (which can be downloaded and launched in the ZX Spectrum emulator), in the development of which the main character took part in the episode of the series (I will not spoil further). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gy/ar/tr/gyartrwkemtxcuoa4p84buect9s.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xp/yd/er/xpydersuuwfbnzyv67m2zd4ccqe.png"><br><br>  Although, to get to it, you need to ... just go in the Chrome browser, and in Safari \ Firefox by <a href="https://www.tuckersoft.net/ealing20541/nohzdyve/">this link</a> . <br><br>  For the first time in Chrome, the link to this game for some reason does not work and immediately <a href="https://www.tuckersoft.net/ealing20541/history/">throws it out here</a> . <br><br>  Although, then it can and normally open the link with the game in the Chrome browser. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dp/25/hl/dp25hlhkoo2ppgxlk8ilg6rzefe.jpeg"><br><br>  In general, if companies producing music, digital or video content treat their listeners and viewers so well that they hide such interesting Easter eggs in unexpected places, then you can definitely say that there are programmers who solve very non-standard tasks and can still there are many more surprises to hide in the future, which will also be found, but how soon it depends on the complexity of the task. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bb/yo/bq/bbyobqn6uusrxor6dph7wlrio34.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g8/hp/zn/g8hpznwvpwftzf9puadyaghphvc.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ae/5q/yd/ae5qydtxqbvtlbhlgc5ez6jzxcg.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xj/mg/ch/xjmgch66bbzkerm6_79beanoucm.gif"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/435610/">https://habr.com/ru/post/435610/</a></p>
