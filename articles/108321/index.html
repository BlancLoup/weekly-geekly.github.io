  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Computer Telephony "Yeastar" for receiving / transmitting faxes</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  One of our clients decided to make improvements to the current work of the enterprise by replacing the analog PBX with the IP PBX OkTell, since the analog PBX did not give them the functionality and flexibility required for the operation of the enterprise.  The initial list of requirements for IP PBXs included: the transfer of all internal telephony to modern VoIP technology;  voice menu;  intelligent flexible routing of incoming and outgoing calls;  refusal to use telephone sets at workplaces - employees must use a headset to communicate with customers;  and refusal to use the hardware fax machine - the function of receiving and sending fax messages is assigned to the fax server module built into OkTell.  Analog PBX connection to the public telephone network was carried out by analog lines, which was planned to be kept. <br><br>  To convert an analog signal from FXO lines to VoIP, the telephony card "Yeastar TDM 800" was chosen.  Unlike a number of other computer telephony cards, Yeastar TDM family cards do not support hardware processing of fax messages, like, say, Synway or Alder boards, where fax messages are processed by hardware.  At the same time, the cost of the boards of the Yeastar family is significantly lower than similar models with fax support, which was the reason for choosing this board. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Since when using voice gateways or computer telephony cards without integrated fax support, the entire fax processing process falls on the shoulders of the OkTell complex, preliminary testing was necessary.  Our company's specialists tested the compatibility of the OkTell plus Yeastar complex for sending / receiving fax messages using the fax server built into the OkTell complex.  Bench tests passed successfully.

      Installation and setup of the system took 1 day.  During this time, the server part of OkTell was installed and configured;  established jobs for employees;  configured the necessary routing scheme for incoming and outgoing calls;  The ‚ÄúYeastar TDM 800‚Äù board is configured and the voice parameters are adjusted for correct reception, making calls and working with fax. <br><br>  After checking the quality and correct routing of voice calls, the operation of the fax server and the passage of fax messages were checked.  During the test operation and testing of the complex at the client‚Äôs site, the perfect operation of the OkTell plus Yeastar bundle was confirmed.  When testing the passage of faxes, a simultaneous reception and sending of several, up to 4 simultaneous, fax messages was carried out.  In total, more than 50 faxes were sent and received.  During the testing period, several real faxes were also received and sent from clients of the client.  As a result of the check, no fax messages were lost. <br><br>  The results we were very pleased.  The experience gained in using the ‚ÄúOkTell plus Yeastar‚Äù bundle for working with faxes indicates the correct operation of the fax server built into the OkTell complex.  In addition, it gives us the opportunity to recommend that customers use the Yeastar computer telephony fee from a more affordable price range in conjunction with the OkTell complex.  And we can be sure that this will not lead to loss of functionality. <br><br>  PS: In the course of testing faxes, we also tested equipment from other manufacturers for use as a voice gateway.  Despite the change of several pieces of equipment, software updates in the gateway (flashing), using different models of gateways, as well as adjusting OkTell voice settings, our company did not manage to achieve correct fax operation and one hundred percent probability of sending and receiving it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108321/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108321/</a></p>
