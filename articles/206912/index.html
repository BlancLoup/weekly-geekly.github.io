      Under the cut a lot of photos. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Long planned to build a home storage and playback of media content. <br>  (endless races with laptop and external hard drives tired). <br>  Finally, the plans are almost fully implemented: <br><ul><li>  as storage and torrent rocking - NAS based on HP Microserver; </li><li>  as a playback system - HTPC; </li><li>  router with gigabit ports (ZyXEL Keenetic Giga II); </li><li>  NAS and HTPC are wired gigabit Ethernet. </li></ul><br>  Tasks and requirements for HTPC: <br><ul><li>  NAS video playback (from light AVI to 3D Blue Ray ISO images); </li><li>  music playback from NAS (FLAC 24/96 - 24/192, HiRes); </li><li>  readiness for modernization ‚Äúfor growth‚Äù (to new formats / resolutions / codecs / shells, etc.); </li><li>  compactness; </li><li>  fit into a rack with audio equipment; </li><li>  noiseless (without cooling fans and classic HD). </li></ul><br>  As a result, searches were selected and ordered (from <a href="http://www.hd-plex.com/">www.hd-plex.com</a> ): <br>  HD-PLEX H5.S package including AC-DC 160W + PicoPSU 150W. <br><br>  Iron configuration: <br><ul><li>  AsRock FM2A85X EXTREME4-M (on this board the power supply radiator is very hot, I do not recommend it for purchase) </li><li>  AMD A10-5700 </li><li>  Kingston 2x2 GB DDR3-1333 </li><li>  Ssd samsung </li><li>  Sound card EMU0404 USB (already available) </li><li>  The choice of the motherboard and processor was determined by compatibility with the housing I selected. </li><li>  And also, the presence in the processor of a rather serious video core. </li><li>  This choice is aimed more at growth than at today's need. </li></ul><br>  4 weeks after placing and paying for the order, a well-packed box was received. <br>  (after shipment, the seller sent a tracking number, which made it possible to track the movement of the parcel). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/42b/bd5/a84/42bbd5a849df61037ee610bade8352d8.jpg"><br><br>  The body is made of painted aluminum, with two radiators on the sides.  Body weight 6kg. <br>  Supports TDP processors up to 75W. <br>  Heat is removed from the processor using heat pipes to the massive side heatsink. <br>  There are two side radiators, but only one of them has slots for heat pipes. <br>  The second radiator has a smooth surface and is designed for one of the options <br>  (Photo from Ineta; on the back you can see the hole for the expansion card): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6bf/60a/023/6bf60a023d66c2a2d6cfc7d470541356.jpg"><br><br>  At the base of the case a lot of holes and small racks for hard drives and various types of motherboards. <br>  The hull supports have shock absorbing rubber rings. <br><br>  The manufacturer, HD-PLEX, has several options for enclosures differing in external dimensions and execution of the front panel (in different colors, with the possibility of installing an optical drive and without, with a hole for the IR LED and USB and without).  For those who want to put a PCI / E expansion card (HD-PLEX H5.S case allows it), you can also buy a flexible riser there.  Expansion card will be located parallel to the motherboard. <br><br>  The assembly process is quite simple.  Included is an illustrated instruction and a tool for assembly. <br>  Carefully and slowly we collect everything (pay attention to the thickness of the thermal paste, we apply it minimally and evenly). <br><br>  There is a subtlety when using the AMD processor.  The manufacturer of the case with the AMD processor recommends the use of only 4 tubes (the limitation is constructive - due to the mounting posts).  But the plastic racks are easily cut and you can install all six heat pipes included in the kit (thanks for the hint <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/maxxl/" class="user_link">MAXXL</a> thanks). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/700/161/197/70016119792e971ac11aba5264ea965d.jpg"><br><br>  Cooling system assembled: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e11/aa8/8a6/e11aa88a6ad62e26e3b17097121f37b6.jpg"><br><br>  Do not forget to pull the heat pipe to the radiator, so that they are fully entered into the grooves. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb7/e34/ffa/cb7e34ffa51f210f6e946221b426fb91.jpg"><br><br>  Unfortunately, the system did not start when it was first turned on. <br>  It turned out that the sent PicoPSU 150W does not want to work with my iron configuration (although, according to estimates, 150W should have been enough).  At least two users from the HD-PLEX website forum encountered a similar problem.  Maybe there was a PicoPSU batch with reduced load capacity, maybe 150W is really not enough for my HTPC.  I did not dig deep, wrote off with the supplier and received approval to buy a new b / n with a partial refund of its cost. <br>  This is what the PicoPSU 150W looks like: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/750/78e/d7f/75078ed7f10d6b50e6a671b95d0fd3a9.jpg"><br><br>  To insure, bought a PicoPSU 160W (with a peak power of up to 200W). <br>  No more problems, everything worked. <br>  View of PicoPSU 160W: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b96/c9a/de7/b96c9ade7d40fa406c32753790fb4d89.jpg"><br><br>  Assembled: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f3c/bc4/5af/f3cbc45afab2ce83cc88bca61775b70b.jpg"><br><br>  OS chose Windows 7. <br>  I have not yet decided on the media wrapper, experimenting with XMBC and MediaPortal. <br>  Each has its pros / cons, the future will show on what to stop. <br>  In MediaPortal, I liked the presence of a separate configurator with a database editor. <br><br>  Temperature indicators of the processor (output to the TV in 1080p resolution): <br><ul><li>  Internet surfing 40-42; </li><li>  foobar2000 Lossless 24/192 41-44C; </li><li>  HD 1080p KMP ~ 45-60C (depending on the video stream / codec); </li><li>  ISO 3D on TMT ~ 60-65C; </li><li>  all the same from under MediaPortal - add ~ 5C. </li></ul><br>  All numbers after 1-2 hours of work. <br><br>  About the issue price. <br>  The case is not cheap ($ 327.5 with a power supply, $ 27.35 shipping), not everyone will go to buy it. <br>  But then everyone chooses from their capabilities / needs. <br>  This building completely suited me in terms of price / type / quality / features. <br><br>  Briefly pros / cons: <br><br>  + decent appearance and compactness; <br>  + The case really allows you to assemble a fanless system; <br>  + massive front panel serves as an additional heat sink; <br>  + in the delivery of a complete set for assembly (case, cooling system, optional b / n and remote control); <br>  + universality of AMD / Intel cooling system; <br>  + the presence of several variants of the body (size, color, equipment); <br>  + the mounting holes for the motherboard are well thought out; <br>  + in case of urgent need, you can put a fan, such as <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/167012%3B">www.ulmart.ru/goods/167012;</a> <br>  + the presence of live and operational support from the manufacturer; <br>  - instability of paint on the radiator fins at the points of contact with the top cover; <br>  - delivery time could be shorter. <br><br>  Some of my tips on ordering an HDPLEX chassis: <br><ul><li>  When choosing hardware for HTPC, be sure to check the recommendations and compatibility on the site; </li><li>  (it is important that on the Maerinsky board there were no obstacles for the installation of heat pipes; the thermal package of the processor and </li><li>  the system as a whole fit into the capabilities of the case;  system consumption did not exceed the capacity of the selected b / n); </li><li>  after selecting the hardware for the HTPC, send a list to Larry (see below) and consult on the choice of the power supply; </li><li>  by agreement, you can ask for thermal tubes of increased length (if anyone needs additional ones, I think the same will meet them); </li><li>  when ordering, pay attention to the type of front panel (with USB port or not); </li><li>  if you order a PicoPSU type b / n, then in the letter ask for a 160W version; </li><li>  I think when choosing iron you should not strive for the maximum allowable performance, it will be more difficult to remove heat (perhaps now, would choose a less speed solution in terms of a processor); </li><li>  be prepared for about 30 days of waiting for the package; </li><li>  HDPLEX questions contact: Larry order@hd-plex.com. </li></ul><br>  About the air mouse and keyboard from the first photo: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Keyboard Rapoo E2700 Black USB.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <a href="">market.yandex.ru/model.xml?modelid=7888880&amp;hid=723088&amp;from=alts</a> <br><br>  + compact size <br>  + radio channel and as a result, confident communication <br>  + touchpad <br>  + the presence of multimedia keys (though they are few) <br>  + exists in white and black <br>  + compatible with media players and TVs <br>  - part of the keys has a non-standard position <br>  - because of the size, it is hard to fully work on it, so a full-sized keyboard is connected for the period of settings and editing the base <br><br>  I recommend the keyboard. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1b2/8b0/5f4/1b28b05f4bd159053b56a8c3e633cb36.jpg"><br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Cywee Aeromouse.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <a href="http://www.dont.ru/item.id16790.html">www.dont.ru/item.id16790.html</a> <br><br>  + price (390rub) <br>  + comfortable sleep mode <br>  - after switching on for 1-2 minutes, the cursor slowly crawls down;
